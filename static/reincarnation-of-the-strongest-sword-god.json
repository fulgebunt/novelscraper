At Green Bamboo upper-class area, Jin Hai City.Shi Feng held a folder of documents as he sat silently on the leather sofa. Gazing at the pool outside through the French window, Shi Feng was filled with both frustration and unwillingness.He was the captain of [Shadow], one of Jin Hai City\u2019s top four gaming Workshops. He had commanded a guild of tens of thousands of people. Even more, he was Jin Hai City\u2019s famous expert; he was the Sword Magician. However, now the only thing he could do was drink away his sorrows inside his home.Ten years, he had spent in gaming.Ten years, he had fought in blood-soaked battles.He experienced countless trials and suffering. Under his leadership, Shadow had successfully established ten City States in <>. They were finally capable of rivaling the First-Rate Guilds. However, before he could enjoy any of that endless glory, a single document had turned everything into passing smoke; once it was gone, it was never coming back.Shi Feng never thought his ten years of effort would just go to waste. He sacrificed so much just for the game and yet, all he did was pave the way for others to the very end. All of this culminated because he had opposed the decision for Shadow to join the Super-Guild, [World Dominators]. It wasn\u2019t even the next day before Lan Hua Financial Group gave him their reply. He had to delete his Level 200 Sword King, the account he had spent ten years of blood and sweat on, and to collect his settlement check from the financial department.All he received was 5,000,000 Credits and a single mansion. When compared to the established ten City States inside the money generating virtual kingdom, it couldn\u2019t even be considered a drop in the ocean.Shi Feng thought about how much he had contributed to Shadow. He thought about how his efforts had turned Lan Hua Groups into a large financial group. Then, he thought about how they still threw him away, as if he was no different from garbage; Shi Feng swore he would take revenge for their actions.\u201cI won\u2019t just let this go. At worst, I\u2019ll just start over.\u201dShi Feng\u2019s eyes flashed with confidence and resolution; his hands tore the termination contract into little pieces. Grabbing the bottle of wine from the tabletop, he gulped down several mouthfuls.Even if he no longer had his Sword King account, even if he no longer had his team\u2019s support, the skills and knowledge he obtained from the game would not betray him. As long as his skills remained, he could still rise once more within God\u2019s Domain; he could rebuild a virtual kingdom of his own.Early morning. The sun had just risen.Di! Di! Di!The phone alarm continuously rang.Shi Feng woke up resentfully. He helplessly reached for his phone by the bedside; the effects from yesterday\u2019s drinking still loomed over him.\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cBrother Feng, it\u2019s me, Blackie. You\u2019re still asking what\u2019s up? Didn\u2019t we agree to become professional gamers? Shadow Workshop is recruiting at our school today. Haven\u2019t you always wanted to become Shadow\u2019s core member?\u201dShi Feng was slightly confused.Lan Hua Financial Group just fired him, so why would he attend Shadow\u2019s examination?\u201cBrother Feng? Brother Feng? Can you hear me? They\u2019re testing at ten o\u2019clock. If you don\u2019t hurry up, you\u2019re not gonna make it!\u201d\u201cBlackie, stop joking around; I just got fired from Shadow.\u201d\u201cFired? Brother Feng, how much did you drink yesterday? Even now, you\u2019re still not awake? How could you be fired if Shadow hasn\u2019t even recruited anybody until now? Alright, just come quickly.\u201dBlackie had cut the call before Shi Feng could respond.When Shi Feng looked at his phone in a daze, he discovered that this old and broken down iPhone 6 was not his phone. His phone was the latest iPhone 12.Immediately, Shi Feng inspected his surroundings.What met his eyes was a messy room, no larger than fifteen square meters. All around, there were books on gaming strategies. At a corner of the room, above the study table, there was an extremely outdated laptop. Within the wardrobe by the wall, there were clothes messily piled together. Inside the wardrobe, there was a mirror; a mirror that currently showed a familiar face.Shi Feng jumped up in shock when he saw this extremely familiar face.\u201cHow have I become young again?\u201d Shi Feng immediately walked towards the mirror. Only after looking at the mirror, at the reflection shown on it, over and over, did Shi Feng confirm that he had indeed become young again.He slept in his luxurious and spacious bedroom yesterday but now he was in this broken down place after waking up. Not only that, he also had become young again.Shi Feng could still recall some memories regarding this place. He had lived here ten years ago. For over six months, Shi Feng rented this place in reluctance, all so that he could play God\u2019s Domain while also attending university. Only after he had earned some money in God\u2019s Domain had he rented a large condominium.Shi Feng thought back to those arduous years. His family circumstances at that time weren\u2019t in good shape. For Shi Feng to attend university, his parents had racked up some debts. Even so, Shi Feng\u2019s parents still made sure to send him sufficient living expenses every month, taking on the suffering, themselves, in return.Shi Feng wholeheartedly wanted to change his family circumstances. However, finding a well-paying job while the streets were filled with university graduates was tremendously hard; so he thought of the highly profitable Virtual Reality games. Setting professional gamer as his goal, he even bought a Virtual Gaming Helmet, training arduously within the game to improve his skills.During that time, bread and instant noodles became his daily meals. To save money, he had also avoided participating in social gatherings held by his classmates, causing him to become an invisible existence in his class. The boys would look at him with disdain, while the girls would distance themselves from him. Everytime Shi Feng went shopping for cup noodles, his wallet would have no more than 10 Credits. He did not even dare buy a ham sausage that only cost a single Credit. In pity, the female salesperson there had offered him the ham sausage at a discounted price. However, the feeling of his empty wallet made Shi Feng refuse with great reluctance.\u201cIs someone playing a prank on me?\u201dShi Feng stared at his younger self through the mirror and at the familiar surroundings. Shi Feng couldn\u2019t help but shake his head, denying such a conclusion.Even America, as the world\u2019s most developed country, didn\u2019t have such rejuvenating technology. Besides, who would play such a joke with a poor old uncle like him?Shi Feng looked at the time on his phone.19th-April-2129.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I have been reincarnated?\u201d Shi Feng\u2019s face revealed a bitter smile.He remembered today was the 5th of August, in the year 2139. It couldn\u2019t possibly be April of 2129, the year he was still attending university.Shi Feng shook his head, trying to wake himself up. Yet, deep down, he still held onto a thread of hope, wishing that he could be reincarnated, returning to the time ten years ago. He walked towards the desk, powering up the laptop.Even if the time on his phone could be faked, the information on the internet definitely couldn\u2019t.After surfing the web for several minutes\u2026Shi Feng was utterly devastated. All the information he found on the internet showed that today was 19th of April, 2129. Even the highly anticipated official release date of God\u2019s Domain was clearly displayed on its official site, counting down to six days from now, the 25th of April.\u201cI really have been reincarnated! Did I really come back to ten years ago?\u201d Shi Feng firmly stared at the news report of God\u2019s Domain, emotional tears leaking from the corners of his eyes.Shi Feng\u2019s feelings were hard to describe at that moment. He felt both regret, sadness, and joy.It was as if everything before him was just a dream.Nonetheless, the chirping of insects and the cold wind blown from the air conditioner told him otherwise, that everything was real.Looking at his phone, at the family photo he took when he entered university, Shi Feng never realized that his parents had white hair. The corners of his mother\u2019s eyes even had wrinkles. They were no longer as lively as before; they were truly old now.A year and a half had already passed since God\u2019s Domain\u2019s release when Shi Feng noticed how aged his parents were. The large amounts of debt, excessive laboring, and stress had caused both his parents to fall ill, gravely ill. Curing them required millions of Credits but, during that time, Shi Feng was merely a squad captain in Shadow. The money he earned was far from enough to foot such expensive costs.Shi Feng tried everything to collect enough money, yet it was still not enough. Even with trying his all, Shi Feng\u2019s parents still left him a few months later.In his previous life, he failed to care for his parents properly. How could he have known of the pain and suffering?After Shi Feng earned millions of Credits, this pain remained within Shi Feng\u2019s heart for forever more.Never would he have thought fate would play such a joke on him. He unexpectedly returned to the starting point, starting back up from zero.\u201cGreat! This is just too great! Hahaha! Since I have been reincarnated, I have to change everything. I will earn enough money to cure mom and dad and I will let them live a life without worries.\u201d Shi Feng silently swore to himself as he wiped away the tears.Just when Shi Feng was planning for his future, Blackie\u2019s call came ringing again, continuously urging Shi Feng to go quickly to the university for the test.Yet, Shi Feng did not rush. He dressed at a relaxed pace, tidying himself up before heading to Jin Hai University.He could not be more familiar with Shadow.Shi Feng still remembered. It was while he was still attending university, Lan Hua Group\u2019s prized son, Lan Hailong, started up Shadow Workshop to enter God\u2019s Domain. Lan Hailong also invested considerable funding into the recruitment of the student experts of Jin Hai University. Shi Feng participated in Shadow\u2019s examination at the time, successfully becoming a core member of the Workshop; whereas Blackie became an outer member. Shi Feng had been happy for quite some time after that incident.After three years of being under the leadership of Shi Feng, Shadow Workshop allowed Lan Hua Group to greatly profit from God\u2019s Domain, quickly becoming a large financial group. However, Shi Feng would never have thought that Lan Hailong would be the one to fire him, personally.Since he had been reincarnated, he had an absolute advantage within God\u2019s Domain that others did not. Naturally, he would not be joining Shadow to become a tool that profited others. He wanted to walk a different path; a path where he fought not for others, but for himself. He wanted to remove the need for his parents to send him living expenses. He wanted to pay back all the debt they had collected. To do that, he wanted to venture, to start his own Workshop, to start his own company, and to build his own virtual kingdom\u2026 all to live a better life.As soon as Shi Feng arrived at Teaching Block 1, he caught sight of a thin and tall figure in front of the building. The tanned youth was pacing around the hallway in a panic; this person was Blackie.\u201cBrother Feng, you\u2019ve finally decided to show up. Fortunately, registration hasn\u2019t closed yet, so let\u2019s hurry in and sign up.\u201d Blackie said anxiously after seeing Shi Feng.Shi Feng shook his head, seriously saying, \u201cBlackie, I\u2019m not joining Shadow; I\u2019ll be opening my own Workshop. Will you join me?\u201dBlackie was someone Shi Feng met in another Virtual Reality game and the former had pretty good skills. The two of them had faced many challenges together and they were no different than true brothers at this point. During their time together working in Shadow, Blackie showed great talent in administration, even though he lacked the talent for gaming. He managed the hundred thousand Guild members clearly and orderly. If Shi Feng had Blackie\u2019s help this time, his plans would be one step further. Yet, he would respect Blackie\u2019s decision regardless. It was because Shi Feng had nothing right now, and Blackie\u2019s family circumstances were not that well, either. Blackie had only chosen to become a professional gamer and join Shadow to earn some Credits for living expenses.Blackie blanked at Shi Feng\u2019s words, lowering his head in silence. It was just too sudden. Not only that, the Shi Feng that he saw today felt different. Unlike his usual impatient attitude, Shi Feng currently gave off an unshakable and confident aura.After a full minute, Blackie raised his head to look at Shi Feng.\u201cBrother Feng, stop speaking nonsense. Do you know how much a Virtual Gaming Helmet costs? That\u2019s 8,000 Credits. You also need at least six people to start up a Workshop. What about the workplace, salary, and everything else? Just the initial startup funds would require seventy to eighty thousand. There are also the follow-up investments. That\u2019s a lot of Credits. Do you have that many Credits right now?\u201d Blackie was very aware of Shi Feng\u2019s circumstances. He knew Shi Feng\u2019s household wasn\u2019t well off, so he wanted to persuade Shi Feng away from this sort of crazy thinking.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Right now, I don\u2019t even have the Credits for a God\u2019s Domain Virtual Gaming Helmet.\u201d Shi Feng nodded his head in admittance. It was like Blackie said. Even just seventy to eighty thousand was considered a small amount. Shi Feng recalled Lan Hailong had spent over 5,000,000 Credits for the hundred man Workshop he had recruited. He had also spent more in the later stages to upgrade the Workshop\u2019s quality and strength.\u201cSince this is so, rather than take the risk, wouldn\u2019t it be safer to join Shadow? At the very least, Shadow can provide us with Virtual Gaming Helmets. Otherwise, forget becoming professional players; we wouldn\u2019t even be able to play the game.\u201d Seeing that Shi Feng understood the core of the problem, Blackie sighed in relief as he pulled Shi Feng into the teaching block.Shi Feng shook away Blackie\u2019s hand, sternly staring at Blackie before saying in a grave tone, \u201cI still plan on starting my own Workshop. I don\u2019t want to be controlled by others. So, Blackie, will you join me?\u201dShi Feng would not insist to Blackie since he did not have any guarantees. He also couldn\u2019t reveal the secret that he had been reincarnated. He could only hope that Blackie would believe in him.Seeing Shi Feng\u2019s serious expression, Blackie felt Shi Feng was acting weird today. This was madness. Everyone knew you couldn\u2019t earn money during the initial periods of virtual games. Did Shi Feng have some way to make money in God\u2019s Domain? Even if they did make money, it would be after a few months. They did not have that much time to waste.After hesitating for quite some time, Blackie reluctantly answered, \u201cI get it. You\u2019re the boss. I\u2019ll start a Workshop together with you but what about the Virtual Gaming Helmets? We can\u2019t play the game without them, right?\u201dShi Feng\u2019s tightened brows immediately relaxed as he happily clapped Blackie\u2019s shoulders, saying, \u201cNow this is my good brother! Don\u2019t worry about the gaming helmets. I recall that God\u2019s Domain had a trial period available for university students. Every university has a distribution point and, as long as you show them your student identification, then, for ten days, you can obtain a gaming helmet for free. Let\u2019s go and take a look.\u201d\u201cWhat do we do after ten days?\u201d Blackie\u2019s tanned face turned ashen, suddenly feeling his future was pitch black. Why did he have to believe Shi Feng? Could it be Shi Feng\u2019s confidence and steadiness? There wouldn\u2019t be a problem venturing together with Shi Feng, right?What could you do with ten days in God\u2019s Domain?They would definitely miss out on the recruitment period of Workshops after ten days. In the end, they still had to buy the gaming helmet but where would the money come from?Not even a professional gamer with a group would be able to earn 16,000 Credits within ten days of God\u2019s Domain\u2019s opening.\u201cLeave the money problem to me.\u201dShi Feng revealed a confident smile as he clapped Blackie\u2019s shoulders.Earning 16,000 Credits in ten days was indeed a pure fantasy. However, he had his spirit as a reincarnated person. No matter what the challenges were, he would break through them all and the release of God\u2019s Domain was the starting point of his rise.Afterward, Shi Feng brought Blackie to retrieve the virtual gaming helmets. He then used all his money to buy two large boxes of instant noodles, placing them under his desk in his rented house. They were enough to last him for over ten days. After briefing Blackie on some things in God\u2019s Domain, Shi Feng quietly waited for God\u2019s Domain\u2019s opening.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu25th of April, 9 pm. Within the dark and silent room, a few glimmers of light flickered alive.Shi Feng laid on his bed, gently pushing the start button as he closed his eyes.\u201cGod\u2019s Domain, here I come.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please report to us.

Also, the time within the game was different than in reality, where two hours within the game was equal to one hour in reality.Each day within the game was made up of forty-eight hours, consisting of thirty hours daytime and eighteen hours of night.Not only that, to allow the bulk of working class people to enjoy the game, nighttime, in reality, was daytime in the game.Shi Feng passed through a multicolored tunnel as soon as he arrived in God\u2019s Domain, arriving at a solemn. golden temple.A female angel with four pairs of wings flew towards Shi Feng. She was only about palm sized.\u201cHello Adventurer, welcome to God\u2019s Domain. I am the Navigation Angel, Gabriel. I will be introducing to you the four main categories and twelve main jobs. Please choose the job that you like most.\u201dWith a wave of Gabriel\u2019s small hand, an illustration introducing the twelve main jobs appeared in front of Shi Feng.These twelve jobs were categorized into four main classes.Warrior: Shield Warrior, Guardian Knight, Berserker.Weapons Specialist: Swordsman, Assassin, Ranger.Healer: Cleric, Druid, Oracle.Mage: Elementalist, Summoner, Cursemancer.Warriors specialized in defending against monsters; weapons specialists focused on physical damage output; healers focused on healing; mages focused on magical damage output. Every job had their own style of battle, which was one of the main selling points of God\u2019s Domain.In his previous life, Shi Feng picked the Swordsman under Weapon Specialists and he was even known as the Sword Magician.Shi Feng had already invested too much in the Swordsman job, so naturally, he would not choose any other job. He chose the Swordsman class he was familiar with without hesitation.\u201cJob selection complete. Please designate a name for your character.\u201d\u201cYe Feng.\u201dShi Feng chose the same name he had in his previous life.\u201cNaming successful. Do you wish to adjust your appearance? Adjustment rate limited to 15%.\u201dThinking about it for awhile, Shi Feng chose to adjust his character\u2019s appearance by 15% as to not stand out. With this, nobody could recognize Shi Feng if they saw his character, though it wasn\u2019t as handsome as the original.\u201cPlease select a birthplace in the Star-Moon Kingdom.\u201dA map that displayed tens of cities belonging to the Star-Moon Kingdom appeared in front of Shi Feng.The opening of God\u2019s Domain was globally synchronized. To accommodate for the hundreds of millions of players, the lands of God\u2019s Domain were incredibly vast, measuring up to two or three times of Earth, and the kingdoms within were even more plentiful. However, a player\u2019s living area and city, in reality, determined the country they would start in, so players could only choose the cities within the country.\u201cWhite River City.\u201dShi Feng did not plan to choose any other cities, so he chose the White River City that he was most familiar with.White River City was Star-Moon Kingdom\u2019s fifth ranked city. It was an important city in the north of Star-Moon Kingdom There were quite a few Workshops that chose to develop there to avoid the struggles between large Guilds.\u201cCity confirmed. Player will arrive in Red Leaf Town of White River City in three seconds. We wish you happy gaming.\u201dThe sight before Shi Feng immediately blurred as he was sent away.Red Leaf Town, the buildings that were chaotically arranged there had a similar style to the medieval ages. NPCs filled the bustling streets, making them feel as if it was another world.Shi Feng arrived at the front of a church, his new appearance resembling a penniless Swordsman. He currently wore a gray Novice Leather Armor and on his waist hung a Novice Sword.\u201cI still ended up in Red Leaf Town, in the end.\u201d Shi Feng smiled faintly as he looked at the familiar sight of the small town, confidence welling up within him.At that moment, many players had started wandering around the town, speaking to NPCs in hopes of obtaining a trail for a Quest. There were also quite a few players that went out of the village, going out to the wilderness to kill monsters. Every one of them was carrying out their tasks as if their lives depended on it and they couldn\u2019t help but wish they could split their time in two.Shi Feng didn\u2019t pay attention to the other players. With a slight wave and touch of his finger, a player\u2019s Attribute Panel appeared before him.Character: Ye Feng (Human)Affiliated Kingdom: Star-MoonTitle: NoneJob: SwordsmanLevel: 0HP: 100/100Physical Attack Power: 13Defense: 4Attack Speed: 3Movement Speed: 4Attributes: Strength 5, Agility 3, Endurance 4, Intelligence 2, Vitality 2.Free Attribute Points: 4Weapon Mastery:One-handed Sword Mastery +5 (Apprentice Rank \u2013 Increases One-handed Sword Damage by 5%)Two-handed Sword Mastery + 5 (Apprentice Rank \u2013 Increases Two-handed Sword Damage by 5%)Free Mastery Points: 0Job Talent:Swordsman Talent 1: Sword-related Mastery +5Swordsman Talent 2: Obtain 8 Free Mastery Points every 5 Levels.Swordsman Talent 3: Sword-related skills proficiency increased by 50%.Skills:Chop.

Eating the Bread would recover 10 HP per second while drinking Water will recover 10 MP per second, and both effects lasted ten seconds.Every Swordsman started with the same Attributes, the only difference being the allocation of the Free Attribute Points.Each player could obtain 4 Free Attribute Points with each increase in Level. With each rise in Level, the different ways players used these points would result in their own unique style.Strength increases Physical Attack Power and the weight behind each attack. Agility increases Attack Speed and Movement Speed. Endurance increases maximum HP and stamina. Intelligence increases Magical Attack Power and maximum MP and Vitality increases the recovery rate of MP and HP. Every Job places emphasis on different Attributes.As Swordsmen belonged to the physical damage Jobs, most people would prioritize Strength. In his previous life, Shi Feng also made such a choice, adding 2 points to Strength, one point to Endurance, and one point to Agility for every Level. It was a very ordinary and commonplace choice.However, Shi Feng did not plan to do so in this life.Without hesitation, Shi Feng clicked on the plus sign (+) for Agility, placing all 4 Free Attribute Points into it. Shi Feng\u2019s Agility increased to 7 points; his Attack Speed changing to 4 and Movement Speed to 4.This method of point allocation was something not even Assassins, who were widely known for their high Agility, would do. They would prioritize Strength first, as more damage meant an easier time leveling up.Unfortunately, Shi Feng didn\u2019t think that way.For melee Jobs, Agility was the best choice at the early stages of God\u2019s Domain. This was kept a secret, only being discovered several weeks after God\u2019s Domain\u2019s opening. When it was finally made known, countless melee players couldn\u2019t help but hammer their chests in regret.After adding the Attribute Points, Shi Feng took a look at his surroundings.Only a while had passed before another large group of players were sent here. Green rhombus-like symbols belonging to players filled the air of the central plaza, blocking out the yellow symbols belonging to NPCs. Such a situation made looking for an NPC an even greater challenge.Di! Di! Di!Shi Feng\u2019s voice communication rang, the caller\u2019s name showing Black Cloud. It was Blackie calling.\u201cBrother Feng, I chose Cursemancer and was sent to Falling Moon Town. Where are you?\u201d Now that he had entered God\u2019s Domain, Blackie was extremely excited, itching to start his journey quickly.\u201cI\u2019m in Red Leaf Town, not that far from Falling Moon Town. I\u2019ll help you level up, so come to Red Leaf Town.\u201d Shi Feng said.\u201cBrother Feng, you must be crazy. Do you know how far Falling Moon Town is from Red Leaf Village? The Map says that it\u2019ll take me seven hours to get there. I\u2019ll fall behind all the other players by a lot if I go there. We should just level up on our own and meet up at White River City after reaching Level 10.\u201d Blackie nearly coughed out blood in anger. Earning 16,000 Credits in ten days was already madness. Instead of frantically leveling up after entering God\u2019s Domain, he was asked to waste seven hours? He wasn\u2019t going to do that, even if he was beaten to death.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You should just come over. You\u2019ll get back the time you waste very quickly.\u201d Shi Feng said dully.When Blackie heard Shi Feng\u2019s confident tone, he asked excitedly, \u201cBrother Feng, could it be that you have a Beta Tester\u2019s information?\u201dGod\u2019s Domain had invited quite a few people to test the game before it opened and these people were called Beta Testers. These Beta Testers could get ahold of first-hand information for God\u2019s Domain and, although changes would be made to the game, the Beta Testers would most definitely know more than regular players.\u201cWhat do you think? Just hurry over here.\u201d Shi Feng answered in a mysterious tone, laughing.Hearing Shi Feng\u2019s words, Blackie knew Shi Feng had reliable information, and he couldn\u2019t help but get excited, saying, \u201cOk, wait for me Brother Feng; I\u2019ll go there right this instant.\u201dEnding Blackie\u2019s call, Shi Feng walked towards a small dark alley of the town.There were hundreds of NPCs in Red Leaf Town. However, NPCs that gave Quests only numbered in the tens, while Hidden Quests numbered five, and Unique Quests numbered only one. A unique Quest would no longer be available once completed by a player.The Unique Quest in Red Leaf Town was only discovered two months after God\u2019s Domain\u2019s opening and it had caused a sensation throughout the entire White River City the last time. As the Quest was unique, the lucky player revealed the method to obtain it, earning the envy of many players. Unfortunately for them, the Quest was no longer available, even if they wanted to do it.Of course, Shi Feng wouldn\u2019t let this Unique Quest go in this life.Shi Feng arrived at the dark alley filled with beggars in tattered clothing. The beggars were like wolves discovering fresh meat when they saw Shi Feng walking over, quickly surrounding him as they begged for food.There was once a player who had given these beggars a lot of food. These beggars would ask for items after having their fill and they would ask for more expensive items after each time. The player had agreed to all their requests, consecutively fulfilling more than ten of their wishes. Unfortunately, the beggars gave absolutely nothing in return, causing the player to nearly pop a vein, becoming a joke for others.\u201cGet lost!\u201dShi Feng yelled as he pulled out his Novice Sword, causing the powerless beggars to quickly hide away.Shi Feng walked to a corner after the beggars dispersed; a vagrant middle-aged man was lying there. There wasn\u2019t much of a difference between the man and the other beggars but if there were one, it would be the man\u2019s unyielding integrity, as he was the only one not begging for food.\u201cDo you need any help, Sir?\u201d Shi Feng formally asked the man.\u201cCan you give me some food? It\u2019s been five days since I\u2019ve last eaten,\u201d the male beggar responded.Shi Feng smiled faintly, seriously saying: \u201cUnfortunately Sir, I cannot agree to your wish.\u201dA normal person would probably spew blood out in anger if they heard such a reply. However, this beggar merely let out a sigh, no longer saying a word.\u201cHowever, if you are willing to pay an appropriate price, I can give you the food you need.\u201d Shi Feng said.The beggar lifted his head and looked at Shi Feng, his eyes carrying a hint of anticipation as he said, \u201cIf I had the money, I would definitely be willing to pay this cost, but right now I have nothing. Although, if you are willing to help me, I will pay you a sufficient price. Are you willing to help me?\u201d\u201cMay I ask what you want me to do?\u201d Shi Feng questioned.The beggar said seriously, \u201cPlease help me kill the Mayor of Red Leaf Town, Cross.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven though Red Leaf Town was just a small town, the Town Mayor was still a Level 15 Elite. There were also Level 25 Guards by his side. Aside from that, killing an NPC would result in being arrested. Killing the Mayor was, without a doubt, a crazy action and no player would believe this was a Quest, as this was no different than telling players to commit suicide. Nobody would agree to such a damnable request.\u201cAlright, I promise you.\u201d Shi Feng unhesitatingly agreed with a smile.System: Unique Quest \u201cSherlock\u2019s Request\u201d accepted.Quest Details: Kill Cross, the Mayor of Red Leaf Town and bring the [Mayor\u2019s Insignia] back to Sherlock.

    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3 \u2013 Lonely SnowShi Feng walked on the path towards the town hall, crowded with people.The less than spacious road was filled with players. They were conversing with the NPCs, taking the chance to obtain a Quest. Such a scene gave one a feeling of arriving at a market.Unfortunately, it was not an easy task obtaining a Quest in God\u2019s Domain. The main reason being, the NPCs had high intelligence, giving them the capability to hold one-to-one conversations. Also, players must watch what they say or risk being given the cold shoulder by the NPCs. And there was a tide of players as competition; obtaining an easily found Normal Quest was truly difficult.After more than ten minutes since God\u2019s Domain started, there had yet to be a single player within Red Leaf Town to receive a Normal Quest.In comparison, Shi Feng\u2019s advantage as a reincarnated person was truly great. Not only has he received a Quest, but it was a Unique Quest; albeit a slightly damnable one. However, a Unique Quest\u2019s reward was incredibly generous. Even top-tier players who had played God\u2019s Domain for a month would drool at the reward of this Unique Quest.As a person who had been reincarnated, Shi Feng had the experience of leading thousands of people while he was in Shadow Workshop. They had even built ten City States. The amount of information on God\u2019s Domain that was within his grasp far surpassed what the average player knew. It was especially true when it came to strategies on leveling up and earning money. These were the must-have essentials for a Workshop with thousands of players to grow in strength.Now that he had been reincarnated and was playing God\u2019s Domain again, Shi Feng wanted to use this information to accumulate a significant amount of advantages. It was all to build a better foundation for his future development. So naturally, he would not be imitating the average player, wasting hours on the streets just to fight over a single Normal Quest. Even more so, he would not be emulating those skilled players, using their refined techniques to kill monsters in the wild, because, at this moment, there were probably more players than monsters in the wild.What Shi Feng wanted to do was to avoid these piles of players; hence why he chose the Unique Quest which had an absurd difficulty.However, completing this Quest required money, something Shi Feng did not have right now.Every player would receive 10 Copper Coins at the start of the game. Although it was not enough to buy a Weapon or Equipment, purchasing HP or MP replenishing refreshments was not a problem.When Shi Feng arrived at the front of the two-storied Town Hall, he was met with a scene of hundreds of people, queuing up into a long line.Regardless of which game it was, the Village Head or Town Mayor was unquestionably a target to receive Quests from. Naturally, no player would let this chance go.\u201cHey newcomer, queue up if you don\u2019t wanna cause a public outrage,\u201d from within the queue, a simple and honest looking male Warrior looked at Shi Feng. The Warrior held up his hand, pointing towards the back of the line of people.\u201cI\u2019m not here to receive a Quest.\u201d Shi Feng said indifferently as he looked at the long line in front of the Town Hall.Compared to the other locations, this place had great order and efficiency. Although it would take more time to receive a Quest, it was much better than some who could not receive one at all.The male Warrior cautiously looked at Shi Feng. Everybody was frantically trying to receive a Quest right now\u2026 but there was someone who actually said that he wasn\u2019t interested towards it? Not even a ghost would believe that!\u201cI\u2019m honestly not here to receive a Quest,\u201d Shi Feng looked at the male warrior. Seeing the person\u2019s hostile eyes and how he thought Shi Feng had wanted to jump queue, Shi Feng said with a smile, \u201cHowever, I advise you to receive a Quest somewhere else. You\u2019ll just be pointlessly waiting here.\u201d\u201cWhy would it be pointless? There were already a few people who came out after receiving a Quest.\u201d After determining that Shi Feng had no intention to jump queue, the male Warrior let out a sigh of relief. He had already been in the queue for over ten minutes now and he definitely would not want someone to cut in line. However, hearing Shi Feng\u2019s firm tone made him curious as to why he would be waiting for nothing.Shi Feng smiled but did not elaborate. Instead, he changed the topic saying, \u201cSeeing as you\u2019re not a bad person, I\u2019ll point you towards a brighter path. Kill mobs in the fields. You\u2019ll have a better future than remaining here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going. There are too many monsters in the wild and I can\u2019t compete with those other people. This place is still better\u201d the male Warrior shook his head. He was not an idiot. At this moment, there were definitely tides of people out in the Field Area. With just his skills, he probably couldn\u2019t even snatch a monster, so he was better off just waiting here.\u201cThat\u2019s because you went to the wrong place. If you go somewhere with few monsters, naturally, there wouldn\u2019t be anybody to compete with you. Compared to the areas packed with both players and monsters, the leveling efficiency there is several times better. Not only that, the respawn rate of the monsters there is slow, so a single person could easily handle themselves,\u201d Shi Feng said with a smile.\u201cIs there really such a place?\u201dThe male Warrior was excited after listening to Shi Feng. He was extremely interested in such a location. He still needed to wait for more than an hour to receive a Quest and the rewards he could obtain would only be EXP and some meager amount of money. If he could grind on monsters for an hour unhindered, the EXP he could obtain would far surpass that from the Quest.\u201cOf course there is. I\u2019ll give you a preferential price of 20 Coppers if you want to go to such a treasured location. Don\u2019t mention EXP; after grinding for a day, the materials you could obtain would earn you more than 40 Coppers. If you\u2019re lucky, you could make a ton more if a piece of equipment drops,\u201d Shi Feng walked closer to the male Warrior, whispering into his ears.\u201cYou\u2019re not tricking me, right?\u201d the male Warrior looked at Shi Feng with hesitation in his eyes. If there was such a treasured location, he could definitely surpass the other players by a lot; but 20 Coppers was not a small amount. The monsters in God\u2019s Domain rarely drop money or equipment, so Copper Coins were incredibly precious.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, you can pay 10 Coppers up front first. You\u2019ll know just from trying after you arrive at the spot. If it\u2019s true, you can then pay me the other 10 Coppers. I\u2019m only telling you this because I see that you\u2019re a good person. Just forget it, if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d Shi Feng turned and left after saying his piece.Shi Feng wouldn\u2019t be doing this if he didn\u2019t lack money. At worst, he\u2019ll just use some other method to earn money.Just after walking a few steps away, Shi Feng was stopped by the male Warrior.\u201cExpert, hold on a moment. Let\u2019s talk about it, alright? Isn\u2019t it just a deposit of 10 Coppers? Here, take it. I trust that an expert like you won\u2019t trick me.\u201d The male Warrior revealed an honest smile, resolutely trading 10 Coppers to Shi Feng.\u201cSeeing your performance, I\u2019ll give you a good location. Although this place is slightly far-off, there is only a single mage-type Level 0 Green Gnome. It has low defense and a quick respawn rate. Chances are also greater of money dropping. A Berserker would be great at killing there.\u201d Shi Feng gave the Warrior a good grinding location after happily receiving the ten Coppers.The male Warrior was relieved when he noticed how familiar Shi Feng was with the wild monsters, even to the degree of knowing the amount of money dropped. He never imagined he would be so fortunate as to meet an expert of God\u2019s Domain and not just any expert; Shi Feng might even be a Beta Tester. The male Warrior became even more excited as he thought of this possibility.\u201cBrother Expert, do you know a location that drops skill books for Berserkers? It\u2019s really hard to fight against mobs with only a single skill.\u201d The male Warrior was more fond of Shi Feng now, even treating Shi Feng as his superior.\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you want to know., but it\u2019ll cost you 2 Silvers,\u201d Shi Feng smiled. Who would give out such valuable information after only a short conversation? Shi Feng would not unless there was money involved, of course.The male Warrior paled when he heard the price. Two Silvers equaled 200 Coppers. Not even the average Guild would have that much money.\u201cExpert, let\u2019s add each other as friends. I\u2019m Lonely Snow. I\u2019ll contact you again once I\u2019ve saved up enough money.\u201d The male Warrior sent Shi Feng a friend request.\u201cAlright.\u201d Shi Feng accepted Lonely Snow\u2019s request.\u201cThen I\u2019m off to fight mobs, Brother Expert. I\u2019ll mail you the 10 Copper immediately after I\u2019ve saved up enough.\u201d Lonely Snow happily parted with Shi Feng, leaving the long queue and dashing towards the grinding location.Now that Shi Feng had money, he walked towards the fruit stall by the Town Hall.\u201cBoss, how much for this Tomato?\u201d Shi Feng asked as he held up a ripe, red Tomato.Both Fruits and Vegetables could aid in recovering a player\u2019s HP and MP. Their tastes were also quite delicious. The only downside was the bad recovery rate. In normal circumstances, players wouldn\u2019t buy them at all, especially during such a period where money was a big problem. Spending money on Fruits and Vegetables was just wasteful behavior.\u201c2 Coppers each.\u201d\u201cGive me ten of them.\u201dShi Feng paid the 20 Coppers. He walked into the Town Hall after receiving the 10 Tomatoes.\u201cHey newcomer, queue up. Can\u2019t you see others are queuing up as well?\u201d\u201cSwordsman over there, what do you think you\u2019re trying to do? Do you know how many people are queuing up behind?\u201dThe players in the queue became enraged and started criticizing when they saw Shi Feng cutting the line, walking directly towards the Town Mayor. They would\u2019ve long since murdered Shi Feng, were it not for the fact that they could be jailed for attacking another player inside the town.\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m really not here to receive a Quest. I\u2019m just here to take a look.\u201d Shi Feng smiled at the players; he turned to look at the fat Town Mayor, Cross.[Cross] (Elite, Friendly)Level 15HP 2400/2400MP 1500/1500There was not a single player who could beat him at this stage. It was not possible, even with a team.Subsequently, Shi Feng took out a ripe and red Tomato, taking a bite out of it.\u201cWhat is this person doing?\u201d\u201cHell! He\u2019s actually eating a Tomato! Each of those costs 2 Coppers! Such luxury!\u201dThe other players could not understand what Shi Feng was trying to do. By coming to the Town Hall to eat Tomatoes\u2026 was he trying to show off how rich he was?Halfway through his Tomato, Shi Feng suddenly threw it towards Town Mayor Cross\u2019 face.The Tomato accurately landed on Cross\u2019 face, spreading bright red liquid all over.System: Cross\u2019 favorability towards you has been decreased by 100 points.Unsatisfied, Shi Feng took out another Tomato from his bag, throwing it at Cross.\u201cHypocrite! Fatty! Bloodsucker! You\u2019re not fit to be the Town Mayor!\u201dShi Feng kept cursing as he threw Tomatoes, whereas Cross\u2019 favorability kept decreasing. Cross\u2019 body turned bright red as tomato juice kept flowing down his body. Adding to his enraged expression, it created an incomparably funny sight.However, nobody within the Town Hall was laughing; it was exceptionally quiet. All of the players became slack-jawed and dumbfounded at Shi Feng\u2019s actions.Just after twenty minutes since God\u2019s Domain\u2019s opening, there was a player that dared to actually attack an NPC and not just any NPC; he was attacking the leader of a town, the Boss of the Beginner\u2019s Area!This person was insane! Wasn\u2019t he afraid of being jailed until his death?Did he no longer want to stay in Red Leaf Town?Even taking your revenge on society shouldn\u2019t be done in such a way!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJust when the other players were expecting the Guards to detain Shi Feng or for the Town Mayor to kill off Shi Feng in a rage, none of these things actually occurred.None of the players knew that insulting an NPC was not considered an attack. Hence why neither the Guards nor Cross attacked Shi Feng. Shi Feng\u2019s actions would only lead to the NPC hating him to the bones and he could forget receiving Quests from the NPC in this lifetime.As Shi Feng\u2019s last Tomato landed on Cross\u2019 face, Cross\u2019 favorability fell towards Hostile. Cross\u2019 Level became question marks and the yellow marker above him quickly turned a crimson red.\u201cDamnable insect! I\u2019ll send you down to hell!\u201dThe bright red Cross roared loudly as he rushed at Shi Feng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4 \u2013 The Sensation Caused By DeathTown Mayor Cross\u2019 furious roar reverberated throughout the entire Town Hall.With a high speed, Cross instantly arrived in front of Shi Feng, his fist stretching out towards Shi Feng.The other players were currently reveling in Shi Feng\u2019s misfortune, taking the chance to gauge Town Mayor Cross\u2019 strength.Cross was a Level 15 Elite, and a single slap from him was enough to swat the current players to death. However, Shi Feng was foolish to the degree of actually angering the mayor. Not a single person in the entire Red Leaf Town could save him now. He would be jailed until he was on his deathbed or he would be chased out of Red Leaf Town.However, Shi Feng\u2019s surprisingly calm attitude puzzled the other players. Was he already prepared for death?When Cross was about to hit Shi Feng, the stationary Shi Feng finally moved. Like a hunter waiting for his prey, Shi Feng immediately unsheathed his Novice Sword. With swift motions, he used the sword to defend his body.Peng!Cross\u2019 fist landed on the Novice Sword, sending Shi Feng\u2019s entire person flying. Just as Shi Feng was about to fall, he flipped his body, landing steadily on the ground with the flexibility of a cat. However, his HP had instantly decreased by 84, and the Novice Sword in his grip trembled uncontrollably. The sword\u2019s durability had even reduced by 1 point; the weapon would become useless once its durability dropped to 0.Si\u2026\u2026All the players drew in a cold breath.Seeing Shi Feng\u2019s troublemaking, they had initially thought of him as a mere rookie. However, after Shi Feng\u2019s recent performance, anybody with a discerning eye could tell he was a very skillful person. Even if Cross had low physical damage as a mage, as a Level 15 Elite, he could still kill any of the current players in a single strike. Yet, Shi Feng was alive. He had used his weapon to block the attack, reducing the damage to a minimum.\u201cHe\u2019s clearly a mage, and yet his strength and speed are truly shocking.\u201d Shi Feng silently marveled as he at looked the lamenting Novice Sword in his grip. Fortunately, he had added all his points to Agility, increasing his Attack Speed to 4. Otherwise, he would surely be dead by now, having to start his Quest all over again.\u201cDie, insect!\u201dAfter failing his strike, Cross was further enraged. Suddenly, his clothes were ripped apart, revealing a body covered in pitch black fur; Cross had turned into a Werewolf with sharp fangs.Every player was shocked at this moment. Never would they have thought the mayor was an evil Werewolf.Cross arrived at Shi Feng\u2019s back in an instant, raising his bright snowy claws and slashing them at Shi Feng\u2019s heart.However, Shi Feng revealed a cold grin, even though he only had 16 HP remaining.Cross\u2019 claws suddenly stopped; they were only a few centimeters away from dealing with Shi Feng. Unfortunately, Cross was hit by a Level 25 Guard\u2019s [Charge], entering a Fainted state for 1 second.Shi Feng took this chance to quickly move away.Just when Cross was about to rush Shi Feng after awakening, he was interrupted once more by another Guard.Both of the Guards were Level 25 Warriors. Although neither of them was Elites, the damage they dished out was relatively high. A Charge, coupled with a normal attack, had quickly taken 300 HP away from Cross. Two Guards had taken away a total of 600 HP, causing Cross\u2019 HP to fall to 1700 in an instant.\u201cAs expected of the Guards, their attack power sure is high.\u201d Shi Feng chuckled as he looked at Cross\u2019 sorry state.Guards were the protectors of the town. They were specialized in protecting the town\u2019s civilians and resisting against the invasion of evil beings. At this moment, the mayor had transformed into a Werewolf; proof that he was not a human, but a spy for the powers of evil. The guards would naturally not let him go, killing him as if he were no different than the monsters in the wild.On the surface, the conditions of Sherlock\u2019s request seemed harsh. In reality, however, players only needed to actively attack the mayor, subsequently surviving the mayor\u2019s first strike. Afterward was just smooth sailing. The Guards would handle the rest after the mayor revealed his true self.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, the reason this Unique Quest could shock the entire White River City, was because the Town Mayor was a spy for the forces of evil. This Quest had allowed players to have a new perspective towards God\u2019s Domain; the NPCs were not entirely reliable, as they might be one of the forces of evil in disguise.Simultaneously, the player who completed the Quest had shocked everyone with his method of baiting the Town Mayor. The player had racked his brain to complete the Quest and, naturally, he wanted to show off his efforts by revealing his strategy. Now, though, it was being taken advantage of by Shi Feng.As such, Cross was now being attacked by the two Guards. Although the damage dealt by the Guards was very high, Cross\u2019 target had never shifted away from Shi Feng. He continuously aimed to kill Shi Feng but, unfortunately for him, the two Guards stuck to him like glue. One of the Guards used [Bone Crusher], while the other used [Thundering Strike], causing Cross\u2019 Movement Speed to plummet. Fortunately, Shi Feng was able to escape death with his 5 points of Movement Speed.Just like that, Cross\u2019 over 2000 HP was nearly depleted.When the other players saw Cross dying, many of them started becoming restless; they wanted to land the last strike on the mayor. They did not understand why the Guards were attacking Cross instead of Shi Feng but a Town Mayor who was also a Level 15 Elite\u2026\u2026 if he died, he would definitely drop some great items.Hiding some place far away, Shi Feng smiled in disdain in regards to their thoughts.Was the Town Mayor someone they could have ideas about? Although the mayor had become one of the forces of evil, this was only a part of the Quest\u2019s plot. In the eyes of the other players, the mayor was still in a Friendly state; it was not possible to attack the mayor at all.When Cross only had 100 HP remaining, all the other players started moving. All of them simultaneously rushed towards Town Mayor Cross. All of them wanted to give the final strike, snatching away the dropped items.Seeing that Cross was only a hit away from death\u2019s door, Shi Feng, too, dashed out.Unfortunately, Cross still died under the Guard\u2019s blade in the end. Not a single one of the players was able to strike at Cross. Although Shi Feng could attack, he did not want to risk it. After the mayor\u2019s death, he immediately took away the [Mayor\u2019s Insignia] and disappeared into the crowd.NPCs within a city would not yield any EXP or loot if killed. Shi Feng wouldn\u2019t even be able to obtain the Mayor\u2019s Insignia were it not for a Quest.\u201cCrap! The System\u2019s bugged! Why can\u2019t I attack the mayor?\u201d\u201cI want to complain! Why didn\u2019t the mayor drop anything after death?\u201dSome of the rookie players resentfully complained. A Level 15 Elite had died before their eyes, yet they did not obtain a single advantage; they simply could not accept it.\u201cMoron. Don\u2019t you know you have a Friendly relationship with the NPC? Players can\u2019t attack an NPC with a Friendly relationship. If you don\u2019t even know such common knowledge, why bother playing God\u2019s Domain?\u201dAfter ridiculing the rookies, the competent players searched for traces of Shi Feng. A player who could kill the Town Mayor in such a way was definitely an expert, someone they should associate with. However, they could not spot Shi Feng, even after looking for a long time. They also did not know his name. They could not help but secretly feel pity.Meanwhile, news of Town Mayor Cross\u2019 death spread throughout Red Leaf Village, creating a sensation amongst all the players.At this phase of the game, where players were still worrying over grinding monsters for Levels, the leader of a town was toyed to death so simply. This was just too mind-blowing!Not even thirty minutes since God\u2019s Domain\u2019s opening, a news thread appeared on the official site\u2019s forums.Mysterious Swordsman kills off Level 15 Elite, Red Leaf Town Mayor. The leader of a town was actually a Werewolf in disguise. Exactly what kind of game is God\u2019s Domain?This news thread instantly caused a sensation amongst the players. It only took a moment for the number of clicks to the page to go past ten million. Everyone became interested with this mysterious Swordsman. Unfortunately, they could not contact the person since nobody knew his name.By now, Shi Feng had already arrived at the dark alley.\u201cMister Sherlock, this is the Mayor\u2019s Insignia that you requested.\u201d Shi Feng passed silver colored Mayor\u2019s Insignia to the beggar, Sherlock.With the Quest\u2019s completion, bad news came to both the players who had already received a Quest and for those who were currently trying to receive one from the mayor. This was because Cross would not respawn. They would have no place to submit their Quest even if it was completed. Red Leaf Town would also no longer have a mayor, though Shi Feng could care less about that.\u201cThank you. Thank you, so much. I have finally attained revenge for my friend. These things should be of help to you.\u201dSherlock passed Shi Feng a delicate little box. Subsequently, Sherlock took the Mayor\u2019s Insignia and left the dark alley.System: Unique Quest \u201cSherlock\u2019s Request\u201d completed. Rewarding 2000 EXP, 20 Free Mastery Points, 1 [Luxurious Ornament Box].With a \u201cHua\u201d sound, Shi Feng became Level 1, and he was only 1000 EXP away from Level 2. Shi Feng\u2019s Level became Red Leaf Town\u2019s top one, only thirty minutes after the start of God\u2019s Domain. In normal circumstances, the average player required 1000 EXP to rise to Level 1. Such an amount required at least six or seven hours of grinding monsters, as each Level 0 monster only gave 3 EXP. Time was also needed to look for monsters, to recover, and so on. Factoring in the massive amount of players at the start of the game that was fighting over monsters, taking over ten hours to arrive at Level 1 could be considered average.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhy is the Unique Quest\u2019s reward so generous? Was it because I completed it at Level 0?\u201d Shi Feng became slightly uncertain but he was still delighted with such rewards.In his previous life, the rewards posted were not as luxurious. Although the amount of EXP was the same, the number of Free Mastery Points was not. The other person only received 10 points for it, as well as a Delicate Ornament Box, while Shi Feng received 20 points and a Luxurious Ornament Box.Free Mastery Points were extremely precious in God\u2019s Domain. Rarely would a Quest award 3 to 5 points. This Unique Quest had awarded 20 points.\u201cHopefully, it won\u2019t let me down. Although it isn\u2019t a Delicate Ornament Box, it is still the better Luxurious Ornament Box. It should come out.\u201d Shi Feng carefully held the Ornament box, a nervous gulp coming from his throat. Slowly, he opened the box.Though the EXP and Free Mastery Points were great, what Shi Feng really wanted was the item inside the Ornament Box. It was an essential item he needed to complete his leveling and money making plans. It was also a top-tier item that many experts drooled over. Shi Feng would cry to death if something went wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5 \u2013 Black Market ChallengeAs the Luxurious Ornament Box slowly opened, a dazzling array of multicolored light burst out from within.Fortunately, Shi Feng was currently standing inside a dark alley; there were no players who would wander over here. Otherwise, such a spectacle would have incited the greed in their hearts and Shi Feng would be killed and robbed.When the glowing brilliance faded, a simple silver necklace and a purple-gold ring could be seen lying inside the Luxurious Ornament Box. Carved on the ring\u2019s exterior were words resembling the ancient language of Elves and within them stored a tremendous magical power.\u201cFortunately, it is still the Ring of Gravity.\u201d Shi Feng let loose his breath when he saw the appearance of the ring. Carefully, he took the ring out of the box and inspected it.[Ring of Gravity] (Mysterious-Iron Rank)Equipment Level: 0Strength +2, Agility +1, Endurance +1Additional Skill: \u2018Gravity Liberation\u2019. Greatly reduces the gravity acting upon the user. Duration 30 seconds. Cooldown 5 minutes.\u201cGreat! It\u2019s not just Bronze rank.\u201d After reading the item\u2019s introduction, Shi Feng became extremely excited. The situation was far better than he had expected.The Equipment in God\u2019s Domain was categorized into Trash, Common, Bronze, Mysterious-Iron, Secret-Silver, Fine-Gold, Dark-Gold, and Epic.At the start of the game, players only received Trash Equipment from the System. This equipment was utterly worthless. At this stage of the game, however, there were no players who possessed Common Equipment. While you could buy Common Equipment in large cities, the prices were costly. As for Bronze ranked, those were extremely rare and they also came with additional attributes. Mysterious-Iron Equipment, however, only dropped from Bosses and, needless to say, they were even more precious.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, the Ring of Gravity obtained by the player was only Bronze ranked. It gave only an additional 1 point to Strength. The skill \u2018Gravity Liberation,\u2019 as well, only lasted for 15 seconds. It was a surprise to Shi Feng that completing the Quest at Level 0 would earn him a Mysterious-Iron Ring of Gravity.As for the necklace, it was just a Gray Item. NPC merchants coveted these items and they were willing to buy them at high prices.After wearing the Ring of Gravity, Shi Feng added the 4 Free Ability Points that came from leveling up all into Agility.Shi Feng\u2019s Agility rose to 12 points, his Attack Speed to 5 points, and his Movement Speed to 6 points. He could almost rival a pure Agility Assassin of the same Level now.\u201cMy Agility will reach 20 points after rising to Level 3. At that time, I can unlock the Hidden Basic Skill of the Agility System.\u201d Shi Feng looked at his Attribute Panel in anticipation.Shi Feng moved his body, feeling it become a lot livelier than before. He wouldn\u2019t be in his previous sorry state if he were to face off with Town Mayor Cross, right now. If his Agility reached twenty points, the condition of his body would become even greater after activating the Basic Skill [Fast And Nimble]; he could even rival against those Wulin Experts depicted in Wuxia novels.Afterward, Shi Feng added 15 of the Free Mastery Points towards his One-Handed Sword Mastery, keeping the remaining 5 points for future use. With his One-Handed Sword Mastery now at a total of 20 points, Shi Feng advanced from Apprentice to Basic Swordsman and the additional damage dealt by using a one-handed sword increased to 10%. He was still 30 Mastery Points away from advancing to an Intermediate Swordsman.Regular attacks were only the basics for a Swordsman. If one wanted to become an expert with the sword, Skills were a must-have. The more, the better, as this would create more flexibility when in battle, thereby allowing the Swordsman to dish out greater Damage.Shi Feng was both an expert of the sword and a person who had been reincarnated. Now that he had a special tool such as the Ring of Gravity, he needed a large amount of Swordsman Skills to display the true potential of a Swordsman. He could then level up at a fast pace. Otherwise, it was impossible to increase the efficiency of killing monsters by relying on normal attacks.\u201cI recall there being a Black Market Challenge in Red Leaf Town\u2019s Trade Area. Players who cleared the challenge for the first time would be able to obtain a skill book for Swordsman.\u201d Most skill books dropped from monsters around Levels 3 to 5 and their drop rates were pitifully low. At this stage of the game, there were still no players capable of grinding those monsters. It would be a big waste of time if Shi Feng wanted to obtain the other skill books for Swordsman. He also did not have the time for it. So, the Black Market Challenge was the only way for Shi Feng to quickly obtain a skill book in Red Leaf town.Trade Area of Red Leaf TownShops filled both sides of the street. There were pharmacies, smithies, bars and more; it was extremely flourishing, just like a small market. However, the current trade area wasn\u2019t as lively as it should be. It hasn\u2019t been long since God\u2019s Domain started its operation, so most players were busy leveling up instead of enjoying what God\u2019s Domain had to offer. As a result, there was only the minority of Lifestyle players staying here. They were here to learn Auxiliary Jobs such as Enchanter, Forger, Pharmacist, Chef, Engineer, Alchemist, etc.\u201cBuying herbs at a high price, contact me directly if you have any.\u201d\u201cBuying ores; rip-offs can stay away.\u201d\u201cSincerely buying high ranking equipment. Price is negotiable. Willing to pay with Credits.\u201dMany logistics staffers of Workshops and Guilds had set up a small stall by the roadside of the Trade Area. They were mainly here to buy items and equipment.Shi Feng quickly headed towards a two-storied building without halting. High-ranking Gnomes guarded the building, and above the building read \u2018Black Market\u2019. This place was the dark side of Red Leaf Town and it was a place of entertainment built by the greedy Gnomes.The Gnome\u2019s Auction House could be seen just after entering the Black Market. Going down along the basement staircase led to two empty fields; one was the Battle Arena, while the other was the field for the Challenge Race.At the moment, several players were standing in front of the field. They were receiving the Gnomes\u2019 challenge.\u201cGood luck! You have to succeed this time!\u201d\u201cGood luck! Stomp those Gnomes!\u201dA few players were currently cheering with all their might for an Assassin player that stood on the field. Their reddened eyes made them look no different than crazed gamblers.The Challenge Race could be considered a testing grounds for a player\u2019s capabilities. Once a player entered the trial grounds, all their Attributes would be fixed at 10 points, their skills disabled, and their equipment rendered useless. Within the 30-yards-long and 10-yards-wide field, players were only allowed to block or dodge the incoming shots from the Gnome\u2019s muskets. A victory would ensue once players arrived at the finishing point.The Gnomes gave out three ranks of challenges: Copper Prize, Silver Prize, and Gold Prize. After a challenge was completed, there would be a three-day cooldown. There was a fee of 5 Coppers for the Copper Prize, 5 Silvers for the Silver Prize, and 5 Gold for the Gold Prize. Naturally, the higher ranked the challenge, the greater the prize. There was even the chance of obtaining a Dark-Gold Equipment.However, if a player obtained the First Clear for the challenge in Red Leaf Town, the reward of Copper Prize may be comparable even to the Silver Prize.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, this First Clear was obtained by a Swordsman named Fierce Gale and the person had received a rare skill book for Swordsman.After a short while, the Assassin on the field was struck. His body lay at the 20-yards mark, still ten yards away from the final point.\u201cDespicable. Just a little bit more. Do you guys still have money? I\u2019ll definitely clear it the next time.\u201d The male Assassin said after reviving from the field.A male Cleric shook his head saying, \u201cBoss Stabbing Heart, the five of us have already given you all our money. We don\u2019t have anymore.\u201dBy the side, Shi Feng shifted his sight towards the Assassin. He was shocked after hearing the two words \u2018Stabbing Heart\u2019.The person\u2019s body was covered in black clothing. He had a short and skinny stature, just like a monkey. Shi Feng could hardly believe that the \u2018monkey\u2019 in front of him was Stabbing Heart, the Assassin who ranked at number 10 on Star-Moon Kingdom\u2019s Assassin Leaderboard.The Assassin named Stabbing Heart shifted his gaze onto Shi Feng. After sizing Shi Feng up, his eyes revealed a gaze as if they had just found prey. With a smile, he walked up to Shi Feng and said, \u201cNice to meet you, friend. I\u2019m Stabbing Heart, Assassin Squad Leader of the [Assassin\u2019s Alliance]. Lend 5 Coppers to me and I\u2019ll return 20 Coppers to you tomorrow. How about it?\u201dStabbing Heart was just ten yards away from the final point this time, so he was unwilling to accept defeat. He had already figured out some of the challenge\u2019s patterns; he would be able to clear it if given another chance. Hence, he thought of using his Guild\u2019s name to shock and awe Shi Feng into lending him 5 Coppers.The Assassin\u2019s Alliance was a large Guild that was well known in the world of virtual gaming. Any veteran gamer would know this name. Someone capable of becoming the squad leader for Assassins was definitely a great expert, a figure that was respected by many players. Instead of lending, the average player would definitely just give the 5 Coppers to gain some favors.\u201c5 Coppers is it?\u201d After some thinking, Shi Feng answered: \u201cI can lend you the 5 Coppers, but you have to pay back 50 Coppers tomorrow.\u201dStabbing Heart was surprised. He was Stabbing Heart, the Assassin\u2019s Alliance\u2019s famous Assassin Squad Leader. However, Shi Feng\u2019s uncourteous reaction was completely different than what he had imagined it would be. Could Shi Feng be a rookie gamer?Seeing Stabbing Heart staying silent, Shi Feng asked, \u201cStill borrowing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll borrow.\u201d Stabbing Heart wanted to weep. Other players would be going \u2018Expert, expert!\u2019 when they met him, yet Shi Feng showed no such reaction. However, when he thought about the bountiful reward awaiting him, even 50 Coppers was worth it.\u201cHere\u2019s 5 Coppers. Let\u2019s add each other as friends. Don\u2019t forget to return 50 Coppers to me tomorrow.\u201d Shi Feng took 5 Coppers out of the 60 he obtained from selling the necklace, not forgetting to remind Stabbing Heart to return the 50 Coppers.With tears flowing down his face, Stabbing Heart received the 5 Coppers and said, \u201cFine. I won\u2019t forget.\u201dNot knowing what Stabbing Heart was thinking, Shi Feng walked away after the trade was completed. He headed towards the green-skinned Gnome who was the Challenge Race\u2019s administrator.\u201cSir, time is money. What business do you have?\u201d The Gnome administrator said so in a lofty tone.\u201cI want to enter the Copper Prize Challenge.\u201d Shi Feng said as he handed over 5 Coppers.After flipping the Copper coins a few times, the Gnome nodded his head in approval. He opened the wooden door to the Challenge Race, allowing Shi Feng to enter.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we have a new challenger on the field. Please let us welcome this brave Swordsman.\u201d The gnome loudly announced.\u201cBoss Stabbing Heart, the kid that lent you money is participating in the Challenge Race,\u201d the male Cleric pointed out.The resting Stabbing Heart laughingly said, \u201cThat kid\u2019s just a rookie. Does he think the Challenge Race is so easy? Even though the distance is only 30 yards, the Gnomes\u2019 attack pattern will change after you get past 15 yards and their attack rates greatly increase. Not to mention, even I have difficulty facing them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure! Even an expert such as Boss Stabbing Heart could only reach 20 yards. I\u2019m guessing that kid will, at most, reach five yards before being done in.\u201d The male Cleric nodded with a smile.Inside the field, the three Gnomes standing at the finishing line readied their muskets, aiming them towards Shi Feng.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAbove the challenge field, the timer started counting down.3\u2026\u20262\u2026\u20261\u2026\u2026Challenge Start!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6 \u2013 Stunning SkillsThe instant the countdown ended\u2026Shi Feng\u2019s body leaned forward and his legs bent. Just like a leopard, he dashed away from the starting line with explosive force.Xiu!By the time the muskets had started ringing and shooting towards the starting line, Shi Feng was already three yards away.Subsequently, another volley of musket shots rang out; a total of six bullets shot towards Shi Feng\u2019s path. Several green lines indicating the trajectory of the bullets covered Shi Feng\u2019s body. Shi Feng would become a sieve if his reactions were not keen.Just as the bullets were about to hit, Shi Feng dodged to the right with a sidestep. He rushed forward once more, after avoiding the second volley of shots.Bullet casings fell to the ground consistently as the three Gnomes continued to aim and shoot. However, Shi Feng avoided them with the vigor of a leopard, every single time. The way he stayed a step ahead of the bullets made it seem as if he had control over them.\u201cIt can\u2019t be. He\u2019s already at the 10-yard-mark.\u201d Seeing Shi Feng taking less than five seconds to reach the 10-yard-mark, the male Cleric couldn\u2019t help but be shocked; it was only a half of Stabbing Heart\u2019s time.Stabbing Heart became speechless by the side. He silently watched Shi Feng\u2019s advance.He had originally thought of Shi Feng as a fresh noob; someone that he didn\u2019t know of and someone that came to the Challenge Race for fun. Yet, the speed and accuracy Shi Feng just displayed were like a veteran who had tempered himself for countless years on the Challenge Race. Every move of his was straightforward and efficient, something a rookie definitely couldn\u2019t pull off. Even Stabbing Heart himself, after going through the challenge several times, felt he couldn\u2019t do any better.Stabbing Heart had the pride of an expert. He did not think that Shi Feng could be stronger than he was. He explained, \u201cWith such nimbleness, maybe this rookie is an athlete or someone who trained in martial arts. However, the Gnomes will change their attack patterns after he goes past 15 yards. He won\u2019t be able to hold it, by that time.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, boss. If it\u2019s someone that isn\u2019t known to our Assassin\u2019s Alliance, he definitely isn\u2019t an expert. He\u2019ll surely be shocked once he reaches 15 yards. Then, he\u2019ll turn into a beehive.\u201d\u201cRight. After 15 yards, the number of bullets fired will be twelve. The target would also no longer be focused on the player, himself. Instead, it\u2019ll cover a wide area. Dodging to either side won\u2019t be an option.\u201dThe other members of Assassin\u2019s Alliance voiced their agreements. They, too, had already witnessed such a scene before, seven to eight times, at that.Stabbing Heart passed 15 yards on his first challenge. In the subsequent challenges, however, his furthest distance was 20 yards. The difficulty after 15 yards was clear to behold.\u201cHe went past 15 yards,\u201d an Assassin\u2019s Alliance member commented.Stabbing Heart and the others quickly focused their sights on Shi Feng, wanting to see Shi Feng\u2019s performance.On the field, the three Gnomes became enraged once Shi Feng stepped past the 15-yard-line. They no longer aimed as they fired their muskets with wild abandon.Suddenly, the bullet trajectory-indicators within Shi Feng\u2019s sight covered a large area. There were only three bullets that would hit Shi Feng. However, it was game over if even a single bullet hit its mark.\u201cFinally, showing your shameless behavior, eh?\u201d Shi Feng revealed an indifferent smile. Unsheathing his Novice Sword, Shi Feng used it to greet the bullets.In his previous life, Shi Feng was always busy with work and leveling up as the captain of Shadow; he had no time to play the Challenge Race. However, he had seen it quite a few times, so he still had a clear understanding of the Challenge Race. He knew the Gnomes would change their attack patterns after the 15-yard-line.The fifteen-yard distance of the Black Market\u2019s Challenge Race was a bar that tested a player\u2019s operating skills. Only those who passed it could be considered to have entry-level operating skills. However, a majority of the players required two or three months before being able to reach this level; a minority took a month. There were only a scant few experts capable of passing it in one try. Stabbing Heart was one of those few experts.Three bullets were about to hit Shi Feng\u2019s head, chest, and arm, three locations.\u201cAs expected, this kid\u2019s no good. The bullets are too numerous and too spread out. He\u2019s already forgotten to dodge them. He\u2019s even dashing ahead like an idiot.\u201d Stabbing Heart knew it was foolishness when he saw Shi Feng rushing towards the bullets. Did he think the challenge would continue if he were just shot by one or two bullets?Right this moment, Shi Feng\u2019s head shifted. He waved his Novice Sword, creating a white streak of light.Peng!A spark was created. Shi Feng had waved the Novice Sword just at the right spot, effortlessly hitting the bullet that aimed at his chest.The threat of the three bullets was simply resolved by Shi Feng. He had, once more, advanced another section of the distance.Yet, the three Gnomes did not stop firing. The muskets in their hands were like machine guns, firing volley after volley of bullets. Within an instant, Shi Feng faced off with another five bullets. There were also bullets all around that prevented him from dodging.Dang! Dang! Dang!Shi Feng swiftly moved his body while waving his sword to deflect the unavoidable bullets. As the bullets passed by his body, his ears could even hear the air being split.Only three seconds went by and Shi Feng had passed through the 20-yard-mark. He was only 10 yards away from the finishing point.\u201cCrap. Boss, who is this kid? He actually used his sword to block the bullets.\u201d The male Cleric widened his eyes in surprise. Shi Feng had given him an indescribable sense of shock.Although the bullet trajectories were indicated, accurately blocking them was easier said than done. Such an action required extreme precision and skill to carry out. Not to mention, the margin of error allowed was a damnable one.Stabbing Heart suddenly became speechless. Deflecting bullets with a weapon was like walking on a thread of wire high up in the sky; a single misstep would send you plunging into the abyss. As if he was enjoying it, Shi Feng blocked the oncoming bullets over and over. Whereas, the bullets seemed to have a life of their own, intentionally avoiding Shi Feng\u2019s body as they flew past.\u201cBoss, that Swordsman has run past 25 yards. He\u2019ll definitely pass the finish line at this rate.\u201d The male Cleric\u2019s heart became a chaotic mess as he watched Shi Feng danced forward, sparks occasionally flashing in front of his body.\u201cI have eyes. I don\u2019t need you to remind me.\u201d Stabbing Heart said in annoyance. He was deeply drawn in by Shi Feng\u2019s actions.The moment Shi Feng went past 25 yards\u2026\u201cDie, challenger.\u201d One of the Gnomes at the finish line laughed. The Gnome took out an automatic musket, sending a wave of bullets towards Shi Feng.Suddenly, the number of bullets increased to twenty-four. Not only that, their distance from Shi Feng was a mere 5 yards. It was an unavoidable distance for players.\u201cHell! This is cheating!\u201d Stabbing Heart unwillingly shouted.The other players became extremely nervous when they saw the scene and they couldn\u2019t help but curse at the shamelessness of the Gnomes.Facing the hail of bullets, Shi Feng quickly turned grave. Although he had known about the second change at the 25-yard-mark, even he would panic in the face of so many bullets.Shi Feng bent his knees, leaping forward like a leopard. He darted headfirst towards the area with the least amount of bullets, reducing the surface area of his body that would come into contact with the bullets. Following which, he madly waved the Novice Sword, simultaneously creating four streaks of white light.Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!After a series of sparks, Shi Feng\u2019s body passed through the storm of bullets.The moment his body was about to make contact with the ground, his free arm pressed downwards. Shi Feng quickly stood up with all his might, rushing past the finish line like a bolt of lightning.Total time spent: 14 seconds. Estimated record time of 18 seconds for Copper Prize broken.\u201cNg\u2026 I\u2019m really not used to this soft and weak body,\u201d Shi Feng slightly lamented after passing through the finish line. If he was over Level 100, with his body\u2019s constitution, he could easily carry out the four simultaneous sword slashes with great ease.\u201cLadies and Gentlemen, a round of applause! This Swordsman has passed the challenge!\u201d The Gnome administrator announced loudly.System: Player was the First to pass the Copper Challenge and break the record. Rewarding player with 1 Silver Coin and Swordsman Skill [Thundering Flash].\u201cIt can\u2019t be. It actually gave out the super-rare skill, Thundering Flash. This is a skill that even a Swordsman over Level 100 can\u2019t get.\u201d Shi Feng thought he was hallucinating. However, he was shocked when he saw the Thundering Flash skill book inside his bag.[Thundering Flash] (Action-type)Requires: SwordRapidly send out three sword lights to 10- x 2-yards forward. Each hit will cause 130% damage and also give a Damage Amplification effect, amplifying the damage of your following attacks by 20% for 15 seconds.Cooldown: 30 secondsWithout a second thought, Shi Feng clicked and learned the skill.Swordsman was a Job that mainly focused on dealing damage to single targets; it didn\u2019t have many powerful AOE skills. Thundering Flash was one of the few powerful AOE skills a Swordsman possessed. If it were learned during the early periods, it would definitely create a huge gap from the other Swordsman.After learning Thundering Flash, Shi Feng started to feel himself gaining the makings of a Swordsman.\u201cYou guys continue playing; I\u2019ll be leaving first. Don\u2019t forget my 50 Coppers.\u201d Shi Feng looked towards the dumbfounded Stabbing Heart, leaving the Black Market after calling out to them.Stabbing Heart indifferently nodded his head.\u201cBoss, he\u2019s gone. He took away the prize, as well. Should we chase after him?\u201d the male Cleric asked.Stabbing Heart\u2019s shock gradually faded after Shi Feng left. He stared at the male Cleric, scolding, \u201cAre you an idiot? We\u2019ll be lucky if we have time to even curry up to such an expert Swordsman. Making enemies of him? Are you courting death?\u201d\u201cNot good. I have to tell this to Guild Leader. Luckily, I added him as a friend. Is he called Ye Feng? I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve never heard of such an expert. Could he be some sword expert in disguise?\u201d Stabbing Heart acknowledged that he could not pass the challenge in such a magnificent way. Especially the last bout after the 25-yard-mark; that was just cheating. It was impossible for players to block or dodge. Yet, Shi Feng had done it.At the Trade Area, Shi Feng met with Potion Master Kevin. He spent 120 Coppers purchasing 20 [Exploding Berry], instantly shrinking his wealth down to 30 Coppers.However, he still spent it, all to level at the speed of a rocket.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Feng took the Exploding Berries and left Red Leaf Town, running westward.At that moment, all players were at Level 0, and all of them were killing Level 0 monsters around Red Leaf Town. There were also a few with good techniques killing Level 1 Baby Wolves in a party. A Warrior tanking at the front and a damage dealer and healer behind, fighting together in an orderly manner. Although the EXP was shared between several people, the efficiency was a lot higher and there were fewer competitors.However, Shi Feng did not plan to compete with these people. Passing through the Level 1 monster area, followed by the Level 3 monster area, Shi Feng headed straight towards Red Leaf Forest, a Level 5 monster area. There were no players who would go there.There were still no players who dared to challenge Level 5 monsters at this stage of the game. Not only was there the suppression due to the difference in levels but there was also the significant disparity in HP and Attack Power. A Level 5 monster could easily steamroll over a Level 1 player. Even a 6-man-party was no match for a Level 5 monster.There was a heavy penalty whenever a player died. Not only would they lose an entire Level\u2019s worth of EXP but their Skill Proficiency would also be decreased. There were simply no players who would take the risk. Otherwise, hours of their hard earned EXP and Proficiency would become pointless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7 \u2013 Leveling With EaseRed Leaf Forest was made up of beautiful maple trees. Level 5 monsters roamed around the woods. To a player below Level 3, this was a restricted area. Shi Feng, as well, was no match for these Level 5 monsters, even though he had reached Level 1.However, Shi Feng ran into the Red Leaf Forest without hesitation. Cautiously, he advanced towards the inner reaches of the forest.Level 5 Forest Wolves could be seen patrolling around the woods from time to time. Shi Feng was currently just Level 1. If he did not stay a sufficient distance away from them, the Forest Wolf\u2019s sensitive nose would smell him out.A Level 5 Forest Wolf had 400 HP. It also had high Attack Power. It would only take two bites from the wolf for Shi Feng\u2019s 120 HP to meet its end.Shi Feng\u2019s only option was to stealthily avoid the Forest Wolves, taking a big detour around them.Aside from the Forest Wolves, Shi Feng also met with adorable Bear Cubs. The little cubs fumbled and tumbled around on the grassy plains, giving an innocent and cute look. However, they were still Level 5 monsters, and they were hated by melee players. This was because of their high HP and Defense, making a fight with the Cubs very exhausting.As Shi Feng used a tree to route past a Bear Cub, he heard a wolf\u2019s howl coming from behind him.\u201cDamn! A wolf den!\u201d As calm as Shi Feng was, he still couldn\u2019t help but call out.In his previous life, many players came in parties to the Red Leaf Forest. Most of them were Level 4 or 5. Aside from grinding a large number of monsters, the main reason players came here was because of the bountiful loot. Skill books, leatherworking materials, and equipment were such examples. There were also a large amount of herbs and ore that were attainable in the forest. However, a single mishap could still cause a party-wipe in the Red Leaf Forest. One of the dangers that caused such situations were wolf dens.A wolf den was hidden and hard to notice. If players did not pay close attention, a pack of Forest Wolves would pounce forth once the players entered the wolf den\u2019s area of alertness. If less, there would be 3 to 5 wolves; if more, 6 to 8. It was a party-wipe trap.Shi Feng\u2019s luck was bad. All at once, 7 Forest Wolves rushed out of the den; the meat on Shi Feng\u2019s body wasn\u2019t enough for them to share.The speed of the Forest Wolves was fast, but Shi Feng wasn\u2019t slow either. With his attribute points all going into Agility, his Movement Speed was at 6 points. He was still a Level 1 Swordsman, in the end. Even if he was a pure Agility one, his speed was still a notch slower than the Forest Wolves.Seeing the wolves catching up, Shi Feng stopped caring as he activated the lifesaving skill, \u2018Gravity Liberation\u2019.Shi Feng suddenly felt his body becoming as light as a feather. His speed increased by a massive leap, easily shaking off the Forest Wolves behind him.In the end, a common monster was still a common one. They gave up after chasing past a set area, allowing Shi Feng to keep his life.After running for over ten minutes, Shi Feng arrived at a range of mountains and hills. Several mountains stood over a hundred meters, located in the central region of Red Leaf Forest. The top of the mountains was surrounded by clouds and mist, creating a scene of immortal lands.\u201cFinally arrived.\u201dShi Feng looked towards the towering mountain and its surroundings. Discovering a waterfall, he walked towards it.In his previous life, players were mostly over Level 20, so their attributes were naturally high. They could do much more than they could while they were low leveled. Many loved exploring the myriad of places in God\u2019s Domain. The central region of Red Leaf Forest was one of the famous places, so Shadow Workshop had sent a small party of Assassins to investigate.Never would they have thought to find a treasure mountain there. On one of the mountains, they discovered many items: rare ore, herbs, and even Treasure Chests. At the peak of the mountain, there was a Secret-Silver Treasure Chest.There were many secretive places in the wild of God\u2019s Domain. Most of these places housed Treasure Chests, awaiting to be discovered by players. The items within Treasure Chests varied considerably, ranging from Copper Coins to Dark-Gold Equipment.The quality of Treasure Chests could be categorized into Common, Bronze, Mysterious-Iron, Secret-Silver, Fine-Gold, and Dark-Gold. However, even the loot from a Common Treasure Chest could rival the drops of Elite monsters. Not to even mention how good the loot from a Secret-Silver Treasure Chest could be.This Secret-Silver Treasure Box quickly allowed Shadow to become a well-known Workshop in White River City. This allowed Shadow to amass quite a fortune during the initial periods of the game.More than just equipment, the Secret-Silver Treasure Chest had a secret recipe for pharmaceutics and a Forging Design.In God\u2019s Domain, the drop rate of pharmaceutical recipes was not even ten thousand to one; it was even lower for a Forging Design. You could create Bronze ranked equipment using Forging Designs, something sorely needed by players. With it, making money would become a simple task.Shi Feng\u2019s plan to earn 16,000 Credits within ten days all depended on the design. So naturally, he wouldn\u2019t be leaving it for Shadow Workshop. However, low leveled players without 40 Agility were unable to activate the Hidden Basic Ability [Flying Steps]. Without it, they had no way of climbing the rocky mountain. There were also no paths that led up the mountain, leaving rock climbing as the only option.Although Shi Feng did not have forty points in Agility, he had the Ring of Gravity. He could still climb the mountain after activating it.Shi Feng easily scaled up the mountain after activating Gravity Liberation. He was already 5 meters up after a few moments.When Gravity Liberation had 5 seconds remaining, Shi Feng found an empty spot of land to rest while waiting for Gravity Liberation\u2019s cooldown.Not long after Shi Feng sat down, the rock wall suddenly shook. A [Rock Giant] appeared with bursts of roaring.[Rock Giant] (Common Monster)Level 5HP 550\u201cThat was quick.\u201dShi Feng had long since been ready when he saw the Rock Giant walking over. He took out an Explosive Berry from his bag and threw it towards the Rock Giant\u2019s feet; sticky orange colored juice erupted all over the ground.As a Level 5 monster, the Rock Giant had extremely high Attack Power, HP, and Defense. However, it had low Attack Speed and reaction time. Its body\u2019s turn rate was even slower. A player only needed 20 points in Agility to easily toy with the Rock Giant. There were plenty of Assassins who loved dealing with such dumb monsters. They could easily be killed without wasting a single HP.Although Shi Feng did not have 20 Agility, he had the Explosive Berries. Each had an effective area of 3- x 3-yards, reducing Movement Speed by 30%, and turn rate by 70% for one minute. It was a godly tool used to counter dumb monsters. Two months after God\u2019s Domain started, a lot of players would use such a method to kill high leveled monsters that were slow-moving. However, such slow-moving monsters existed in limited numbers in God\u2019s Domain, so grinding on them for quick levels was not possible.The Rock Giant\u2019s speed sharply reduced after being hit by the Explosive Berry.Shi Feng pulled out his Novice Sword and rushed towards the Rock Giant\u2019s back, chopping down at it.Above the Rock Giant\u2019s head, three points of damage appeared. It was a hardly mentionable damage when compared to its 550 HP. The Rock Giant also regenerated 1% of its HP every 5 seconds; that was 5.5 HP every 5 seconds. It was very challenging to kill it within a minute.The Rock Giant tried to turn around when Shi Feng attacked it. However, its body\u2019s turn rate was slow, to begin with. Now that there was an extra 70% speed reduction, it was just abominably slow. Shi Feng attacked it twice more, following up with another [Chop], causing a series of -3, -3, -6 to appear.The effect of Chop was not that great due to the level suppression. However, because the Rock Giant was 4 Levels higher, there was an additional bonus towards Skill Proficiency. Coupled with one of the Swordsman\u2019s natural Talents, a single usage had increased Chop\u2019s SP by 3 points.This was an absolute location for raising Skill Proficiency.After much trouble, the Rock Giant turned around to face off against Shi Feng. However, Shi Feng did not give it any chance, quickly circling to its back where he continued attacking.Thundering Flash!Suddenly, a single sword light caused 4 damage, followed by another that dealt 5 damage, and the last one that dealt 7 damage.After all three streaks of thunder hit its mark, Thundering Flash\u2019s SP increased by 3 points.Another few slashes followed.A series of -4, -4, -4 damage was dealt. Though each strike only had an increase of 1 damage, the totaled up damage would still be great. Although the effect of Thundering Flash lasted only for fifteen seconds, it had greatly increased the speed of killing the Rock Giant. The battle could be ended within a single minute now, saving up a precious Explosive Berry.Even if the Rock Giant had high HP and Attack, it was no different than a practice dummy if it couldn\u2019t land a hit on Shi Feng. It was just giving Shi Feng EXP and SP.Skill Proficiency could not be increased just by using the skill. When using it on a monster of the same level, there was a 20% chance to increase it by one point. For monsters of a higher level, there was a 40% chance if it was one level higher, 70% for two levels, 100% for three levels, 150% for four levels, and 200% for five levels. The maximum limit was 200%.Now that Shi Feng was killing a Level 5 Rock Giant, his SP increased several times the rate of others.Not even a full minute had gone by before the Rock Giant finally fell.System: Level 5 Rock Giant killed. Level difference of 4. EXP obtained increased by 400%. Obtained 120 EXP.Shi Feng\u2019s EXP bar increased by a chunk. He was now 880 EXP away from Level 2. That meant he needed to kill another 8 Rock Giants to reach Level 2.These mountains in the central region were a great place for leveling up and looking for treasure. Unfortunately, two months had passed before people discovered them.Shi Feng searched the Rock Giant\u2019s body after killing it, obtaining a [Bronze Ore]. It was a material used to make Bronze Equipment. He also acquired a piece of [Hard Stone]. Subsequently, Shi Feng searched around the empty land. A few moments later he found a rare herb called [Hundred Souls Flower]. It was one of the core materials used to make [Basic Regeneration Potion].Just as he got close to it, another Rock Giant spawned. Shi Feng threw out another Explosive Berry.Thundering Flash!Chop!In just a short moment, Shi Feng obtained another Hard Stone, 120 EXP and a large amount of SP.Shi Feng continued climbing up when the cooldown finished on the Ring of Gravity.On his way up, he searched for rare herbs while killing Rock Giants.Following the fall of the 8th Rock Giant, Shi Feng became Level 2. He added all his points into Agility, letting it reach 16 points. He was just 4 points away from unlocking [Fast And Nimble]. The SP for Chop has also reached 300 points, raising the skill to Level 2; the next level required 600 SP. The skill now increased damage by 12 points, and its cooldown was reduced by 1 second.The other players would go crazy if they found out about Shi Feng\u2019s leveling speed. Just going from Level 0 to Level 1 required more than a handful of hours. As for going from Level 1 to 2, at the very least, doing so would require seven or eight hours. Shi Feng spent less than twenty minutes to reach Level 2. His leveling speed was like a rocket launching.Shi Feng walked towards a dead Rock Giant and searched it.\u201cSeems like my luck isn\u2019t bad at all. It even dropped equipment.\u201d Shi Feng discovered a piece of Cloth Armor, though he was somewhat disappointed.[Gorgeous Cloth-Shirt] (Common Equipment)Level 4Defense +3Mana +10Durability 20/20God\u2019s Domain had just started operating. The drop rate of equipment was extremely low. Common Equipment was extremely rare, especially a Level 4 Common Equipment. There was definitely someone who would buy it at a high price.Shi Feng placed the equipment into his bag. Just as he was about to continue upwards, he suddenly noticed a cave not far ahead.When he walked over to check, Shi Feng\u2019s heart rate quickened.Shi Feng spotted a huge Rock Giant sleeping within the cave. Its entire body was made up of silvery rocks, different from the normal gray-colored ones.[Shrews] (Special Elite)Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLevel 6HP 900Special Elites were a lot stronger than normal Elites. A regular Elite monster could decimate a 6-man-party of the same level. However, a Special Elite required twelve players of the same level to deal with, maybe even fifteen players. That meant Shrews required fifteen Level 6 players working together to kill.However, Shi Feng rushed ahead without hesitation. He used Thundering Flash immediately, causing ray after ray of thunder to cut across Shrews\u2019 huge body.Damages of -1, -2, -3 appeared above Shrews\u2019 head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8 \u2013 Killing ShrewsEven though the damage dealt by Shi Feng was negligible, Shrews still woke up from his deep slumber.Anybody would be enraged when they were abruptly awoken.\u201cI\u2019ll flatten you, puny human!\u201d Shrews bellowed. The entire cave shook as Shrews stood. With giant strides, Shrews walked towards Shi Feng.Not giving Shrews any chance, Shi Feng took out an Explosive Berry and tossed it in front of Shrews\u2019 path.Speed was always a Rock Giant\u2019s weakness. There was no exception even for a Special Elite. Shrews only had a larger size, a stronger Attack, and more attack methods. Though his Movement Speed and Attack Speed were slightly faster, under the slowing effects of the Explosive Berry, he was still as slow as a turtle.On the other hand, Shi Feng\u2019s Movement Speed and Attack Speed were very fast due to his 16 Agility. Shi Feng immediately circled to Shrews\u2019 back and began his fierce assault.A series of damages appeared above Shrews\u2019 head.-2, -2, -2, -2\u2026\u2026They were followed by another Chop that dealt 6 damage.It had to be said, Shrews had a frightening Defense. Even with the amplified damage from Thundering Flash, a Level 2 Chop had only dealt 6 damage. A Level 1 Chop would probably only deal 4 damage.Shrews only turned around after receiving a series of attacks. It lifted its mountain-sized foot and stomped down, towards Shi Feng.As a reincarnated person, Shi Feng had experienced countless battles in God\u2019s Domain. He did not have a thread of panic in him when facing against Shrews. With a step, Shi Feng nimbly evaded towards Shrews\u2019 back, avoiding Shrews\u2019 sluggish attack. Shi Feng then followed up with a series of mad cuts.When five seconds passed, Shrews regenerated 18 HP, leaving him with a remainder of 886 HP. Half of Shi Feng\u2019s efforts had gone to waste within an instant.Compared to Common ones, Elite monsters or above would regenerate 2% of their HP every 5 seconds during battle. Shrews had 900 HP, so it was 18 HP every 5 seconds. This regeneration had exceeded the damage Shi Feng could deal using normal attacks.Even so, Shi Feng still calmly waved his sword, continuously reaping away Shrews\u2019 HP.An average player would\u2019ve already given up when seeing such high HP and regeneration. Shi Feng would not, though. Sixteen points of Agility allowed Shi Feng to avoid and attack with ease. His high Attack Speed also allowed the damage he dealt to mitigate Shrews\u2019 regeneration completely. However, killing Shrews required a lot of time.It was very dull, just avoiding and madly attacking. Dealing out strong attacks was very tiring, both physically and mentally.With each passing second Shrew\u2019s HP continually fell.Fifteen seconds later\u2026Once Thundering Flash\u2019s amplifying effect disappeared, the damage Shi Feng caused sharply reduced. Each strike of his sword only dealt 1 damage, and Chop only took away 4 HP from Shrews. Shi Feng immediately fell into a bitter battle.Another 5 seconds passed, and Shrews once more regenerated 18 HP.However, Shi Feng only dealt 17 damage within that 5 seconds. It wasn\u2019t even enough to even make up for Shrews\u2019 regeneration.Shi Feng wrinkled his brows. As expected, it was hard to kill off Shrews. It was just a pointless endeavor without sufficient damage.Do I give up?Just as Shi Feng was thinking so\u2026\u201cI want to flatten you!\u201d Shrews roared as he stomped his foot.Suddenly, the entire cave shook. Sharp stalactites fell from the cave ceiling one after another, covering the entire cave.\u201cIt even has a party-wipe skill?\u201dSeeing the bad situation, Shi Feng moved quickly away from Shrews\u2019 side, dodging the falling stalactites.The stalactites continuously fell in great numbers. Their speed was quick as well. If a party came into this cramped space, there wouldn\u2019t be any place to dodge. They would definitely be party-wiped. If it weren\u2019t for his nimble body and the somewhat spacious area, Shi Feng would be hard pressed to avoid these falling rocks.Shrews revealed an exhausted expression after finishing his skill. Shi Feng\u2019s eyes shone; he quickly rushed ahead.Thundering Flash!Chop!-4, -5, -6, -10.Suddenly, a series of terrifying damages were caused.[Fatigue] state, it was a period of weakness that appeared after a Boss used a powerful skill. In this state, the Boss would have both its Attack and Defense greatly reduced.With this Fatigue state, Shi Feng could see the hope of killing Shrews.Shi Feng took the chance to attack even more fervently.-4, -4, -4\u2026Each sword strike took away 4 HP while Shrews was under both states of Fatigue and Damage Amplification.During this weakened period, Shrews\u2019 regeneration also fell to 1%.By the time Shrews returned to his normal state, Shi Feng had already taken away 15% of Shrews\u2019 HP.The subsequent battle was filled with persistence. Shi Feng would repeatedly attack to make up for Shrews\u2019 regeneration. Every 30 seconds, he would deal a burst of damage with Thundering Flash. Following which, he would await Shrews\u2019 use of his big move. This party-wipe skill was a nightmare to player parties. To Shi Feng however, it was a chance.As expected, Shrews would again use his big move after a period of time. Shi Feng took this chance to take away 16% of Shrews\u2019 HP.Time passed bit by bit.After using 5 Explosive Berries, Shrews had 32% HP remaining.When Shrews activated his big move once more, Shi Feng took away another 16% of his HP. Shrews was quickly left with 16% HP remaining.Just as Shrews\u2019 HP fell to 15%, a sudden change occurred.Shrews\u2019 body continuously shrunk, his Attack and defense reducing as well. However, his Movement Speed and Attack Speed kept increasing. This change was very disadvantageous to Shi Feng.Although the Explosive Berry was still in effect, Shrews\u2019 attacks were becoming faster. He had nearly landed a hit on Shi Feng.Shi Feng was just Level 2. Even if Shrews\u2019 Attack Power had reduced, a single hit was enough to end Shi Feng. If Shi Feng died, he would lose a level and a lot of Skill Proficiency; it was not something he wished to see happen.\u201cFight!\u201d A cold glint flashed through Shi Feng\u2019s eyes as he activated Gravity Liberation. Suddenly, dodging became relaxing.It was impossible to easily give up on a Special Elite with only 15% HP remaining.Shi Feng continued to circle and madly hack his sword at Shrews.Every hit dealt 3 damage, slowly reducing Shrews\u2019 HP.14%\u202610%\u20269%\u20268%\u20265%\u2026Gravity Liberation\u2019s duration became shorter and shorter. When there were only 7 seconds left, Shrews still had 5% of his HP. Shi Feng would definitely be one-shotted as soon as Gravity Liberation ended.Quick! Quick! Quick!Shi Feng\u2019s eyes turned blood red as his sword strikes became faster and faster.Just as Shrews had only 10 HP remaining, Gravity Liberation ended\u2026\u2026Shi Feng\u2019s speed dropped sharply. A cold, human-like grin appeared on Shrews\u2019 face as he smashed his boulder-like fist down on Shi Feng.\u201cDie!\u201d The cooldown of Thundering Flash finally finished.Thundering Flash!In an instant, three streaks of light passed through Shrews\u2019 body.-4, -5, -6.Shrews\u2019 final 10 HP was taken away.Boom! Shrews turned into a pile of rubble.System: [Special Elite] Shrews killed. Level difference of 4. EXP obtained increased by 400%. Obtained 940 EXP.Shi Feng\u2019s experience bar abruptly rose by 27%, pushing him a big step closer towards Level 3.After killing off Shrews, Shi Feng searched around in the pile of rubble.The drops of a Special Elite were far better than a normal Elite. Shi Feng obtained an equipment, a skill book, and 16 Coppers.\u201cThe rewards for challenging higher levels sure are good. Even a Bronze Shield dropped. I can definitely sell it for a high price. It would be great if I could grind it a few more times.\u201d Shi Feng looked at the blue cross-shaped shield in his hands. He could already imagine how the Guilds would be willing to pay a high price for the shield.[Rock-Iron Shield] (Bronze Rank)Equipment Requirement: Strength 8Equipment Level: 5Defense +21Defense Rate 23%Strength +2, Endurance +4HP +30The shield could be considered high-quality with such attributes. When equipped, the shield would greatly increase Defense. HP would also be increased by 110 points; this was equivalent to one-third of a Level 5 Warrior class\u2019 HP. Using it to dive into Level 5 Dungeons was more than enough. It could even be used to dive into Level 8 Dungeons.The skill book was a good one as well. It was a skill that could be used by all melee Jobs, [Parry]. It required a melee weapon to be used. It could block a single attack that came from the front, and it had a cooldown of thirty seconds.Parry was a popular skill among all melee Jobs. It was a must-learn skill for Warrior classes. The skill had a low drop rate, and it was almost never seen being sold on the market, as it was a lifesaving skill. You could activate it at a crucial moment, and it might even help you through a crisis. It was especially true when battling against a Boss. If the healers could not keep up, then you could use Parry to block an attack, giving the healers more time to heal you.Taking a look at skill, Shi Feng decided to learn it. Although he could get a better price if he sold the skill book together with the shield, the action was no different than killing the chicken to get the egg. It was something Shi Feng wouldn\u2019t do.Shi Feng continued climbing upwards after killing Shrews.The Bronze Shield was worth only a meager amount of money. The real fortune was the Secret-Silver Treasure Chest.Shi Feng only had 4 Explosive Berries remaining. However, he was not even a third of the distance to the peak. It was also very easy to meet up with a monster at the resting points. This caused Shi Feng to choose his path more carefully.Half an hour later\u2026After cautiously advancing the entire way up, Shi Feng was finally at the peak of the mountain. The visibility at the top was very poor with all the white clouds and mist. Shi Feng could only see twenty yards in front of him.On his way up, Shi Feng had used all 4 of the remaining Explosive Berries on Rock Giants. If another monster appeared, Shi Feng could only give up and start all over again.Just as Shi Feng walked ahead a few steps\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA few blurry shadows could be seen up ahead.At this moment, an emergency notification came from the system.System: Player has discovered The Lost Lands. Activated Hidden Quest \u201cPast Glory\u201d. Temporarily disabled player\u2019s communications to the outside world. Unable to leave the map until Quest is completed.\u201cCrap, those Assassins lied.\u201d Shi Feng silently cursed. Those Assassins had undoubtedly kept hidden some information.The situation at the mountain peak was entirely different from what the Assassins reported.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough the lies of those Assassins angered Shi Feng, he had to remain calm in facing this unknown situation.Even members of a Workshop would have their own selfish motives. They would definitely hide some of their important discoveries, silently empowering themselves and making a fortune.There were plenty of such people in a Workshop. Be they outer members or core members, after some time, there were always some exceptionally strong people who suddenly appeared, their social statuses abruptly rising. Shi Feng was one such example. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to turn from a core member into the Workshop\u2019s captain.\u201cThey only told others about seeing a Secret-Silver Treasure Chest after coming to The Lost Lands and nothing else. There is definitely something more important that Secret-Silver Treasure Chest. Is it this Hidden Quest?\u201d Shi Feng called out the System\u2019s Quest Panel.Hidden Quest of The Lost Lands \u2013 \u201cPast Glory\u201d.Aside from the name, there was no other information about the Quest. Shi Feng did not even know what he had to do.\u201cIs it a region-activated Quest?\u201d With his ten years of experience in God\u2019s Domain, Shi Feng quickly discovered the essence of Hidden Quests.There were some Quests with special characteristics in God\u2019s Domain. They were only triggered in certain areas. Not only that, these Quests did not provide any information. Players were required to search for it themselves. After the Quest was completed, it would no longer be triggered again, even if another player came to this place. It could be called as a special kind of Unique Quest.At the same time, it was a Quest filled with extreme danger.Searching for the method to complete the Quest in an unknown region also meant dealing with the unknown monsters of the region. For such special Quests, the region\u2019s monsters were usually several levels higher compared to the surrounding areas. An average player had no chance in completing the Quest.There were 6 Assassins over Level 20 that came to this place last time. The Quest was also triggered in this region with Level 5 monsters, so the Assassins could complete the Quest.\u201cThere\u2019s no point in bothering. Since I can\u2019t get out, I might as well look around. At worst I\u2019ll just die and be sent back to the town.\u201d Shi Feng advanced in large strides after thinking it through.A few moments after walking through the mists, Shi Feng spotted a few blurry figures up ahead.It was a city. A city which had been abandoned ages ago. All around, there were ruined houses. Judging from the size of the city and the magnificence of the buildings, it seemed this city once flourished. It was even more prosperous and brilliant than White River City.However, this \u2018flourishing\u2019 city did not have even a shadow of a person now.Shi Feng silently entered the city. He observed the surroundings while looking for clues about his Quest.Looking through a city that could fit millions was like looking for a needle in a haystack.Hours quickly went by. After searching through tens of streets and hundreds of houses, Shi Feng had yet to find a single clue for his Quest. God\u2019s Domain had just started. It was the best time to widen the gap with others, yet Shi Feng had wasted hours exploring this place. There were plenty of players who had already reached Level 1, but Shi Feng was still paused at 34% of Level 2.Shi Feng hesitated. Should he continue looking for clues to the Quest, or should he just end himself here and revive back at the town?\u201cI\u2019ll look for another hour. If it\u2019s still no good, then I\u2019ll return to the town.\u201d Shi Feng laid down a timeframe for himself. Although Quests like these were precious, he did not have that much time to waste. He still had a ton of Quests he could do. There was no need to waste away in this place.Time slowly passed by, bit by bit.Shi Feng arrived at the central tower of the city. This place was once a sacred ground for mages. It was the best place to learn magic. Now, however, it was irreparably ruined. Even the Magic Crystal at the tower\u2019s peak had shattered.Shi Feng went up the tower. He stood in the tower\u2019s observatory, filling his eyes with the city\u2019s scenery. Shi Feng would\u2019ve slowly savored the sight were he not in a rush.After taking a look around, he still did not find any special locations.Just as Shi Feng was about to leave.\u201cYoung adventurer, welcome to the City In The Sky.\u201dA white-bearded, old man suddenly appeared. The old man\u2019s voice was filled with vicissitudes and wisdom. The sudden appearance of the old man shocked Shi Feng into a jump. He had even thought the old man was some monster that had appeared. However, he let loose a breath after noticing the yellow indicator above the old man.City In The Sky?Shi Feng became shocked when he thought of this well-known city of God\u2019s Domain.City In The Sky, the name of this city had once shaken the entire continent of God\u2019s Domain. There were countless legendary Jobs in this city. There was even the famous Demigod ranked Sword Saint, Ultear. It was a city which was even feared by Gods themselves. Unfortunately, the city had fallen during the Third God\u2019s War, becoming a regret of God\u2019s Domain.\u201cRespectful Elder, is there anything I can help you with?\u201d Shi Feng smiled and asked in a formal tone.\u201cHelp?\u201d The white-bearded elder shook his head, smiling as he said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need any help. I imagine you wish to become stronger. I can help you with that, but are you willing to accept a test of mine?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m willing to receive your test.\u201d Shi Feng felt relieved. The trail to the Quest, Past Glory was here. He didn\u2019t have to die back to town, losing both levels and SP.The elder nodded his head in satisfaction, gravely saying, \u201cI\u2019ll give you three choices. The first one is the Normal difficulty. After you pass it you\u2019ll get a Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chest. The second one is the Hard difficulty, where you\u2019ll get a Secret-Silver Treasure Chest. In addition, you can get additional rewards depending on your rate of completion. The third option is the Hell difficulty, where you\u2019ll be rewarded a Fine-Gold Treasure Chest. You\u2019ll also receive additional rewards depending on your rate of completion.\u201d\u201cYoung adventurer, which do you choose?\u201dThree choices. Each harder than the other, and each more attractive than the other. The 6 Assassins who were over Level 20 had chosen the Hard difficulty. They returned with the Secret-Silver Treasure Chest but chose to hide the additional reward. This meant that the additional reward was even better than the Secret-Silver Treasure Chest.After some thought about it, Shi Feng decided to bravely challenge it. A person who had been reincarnated should have courage.\u201cRespected Elder, I choose the Hell difficulty.\u201d Shi Feng was confident he could manage this difficulty. If he could complete it, then it would have a great effect on his future developments.\u201cHahaha! Young people sure are full of energy! I truly admire you, but be sure not to regret your choice.\u201d The elder disappeared after his hearty laughter.System: Quest \u201cPast Glory\u201d accepted. Face off against 1000 monsters of the same level. Considered Passed after killing 500 monsters. Time limit of 4 hours. Quest failure penalty \u2013 all Attributes permanently reduced by 10 points.Attributes are the essence of a Job. If Shi Feng\u2019s Attributes were all reduced by 10 points, then he was as good as crippled.\u201cThis penalty sure is ruthless.\u201d Shi Feng\u2019s scalp started itching as he looked at the countless Specter Warriors appearing below the tower.The countdown started. There were five seconds remaining before the monsters attacked.[Specter Warrior] (Common Monster)Level 2HP 230Fighting against one of them would be easy. Against an ocean of them, however, even Shi Feng would start to panic.Rushing in was just plain suicide; Shi Feng would quickly become surrounded and killed. The only choice was to fight the monsters one by one.Shi Feng had a wealth of experience in battling. He quickly ran down the tower and stood at the staircase.The stairs only allowed two monsters to pass through at a time, so it was the best place to attack from. Shi Feng would be able to clear this Quest so long as he guarded the staircase.Once the five seconds were up, every single Specter Warrior rushed the tower with wild abandon. However, the staircase was too narrow. As a result, they were blocking each other; Shi Feng only had to face 2 Specter Warriors at a time. With regards to the warriors\u2019 attacks, Shi Feng could dodge them with relative ease.Thundering Flash!Chop!Three streaks of light flashed across, instantly causing a high damage of 60 to all Specter Warriors within a two- by ten-yard area. The Chop that followed dealt 33 damage.Within an instant, the first Specter Warrior had only half of its HP remaining, whereas the tens of others behind had lost a quarter of their HP.Previously, Shi Feng faced off against high-leveled monsters with very high defense; the effects of Thundering Flash and Chop were both greatly reduced.Now that Shi Feng was facing monsters of the same level, Thundering Flash could vividly display its prowess as a powerful AOE damaging skill.With Thundering Flash\u2019s damage amplification effect, Shi Feng only needed 5 strikes from his sword to finish off the first Specter Warrior.In order to increase his killing speed, Shi Feng activated Gravity Liberation to increase his Attack Speed.Coupled with the damage amplification, each warrior only needed three seconds to be dealt with.Unfortunately, the Specter Warriors did not give any experience. Instead, Skill Proficiency had a 100% chance to increase by 1 point.With every death of a Specter Warrior, Shi Feng\u2019s SP continuously increased. Shi Feng became very happy after seeing such a sight.The elderly NPC probably had not imagined that a Level 2 Swordsman would possess such a powerful AOE skill. With such a skill, Shi Feng feared crowd-tactics the least. Shi Feng could also easily dodge attacks in a one versus two scenario.Other players would have most likely failed the Quest, yet Shi Feng was able to complete it with perfection.After two hours had gone by, Thundering Flash had reached Level 2 after its SP increased to 300 points. The skill\u2019s damage increased from 130% to 135%, and its cooldown reduced from 30 seconds to 28 seconds.Chop\u2019s SP had also increased to 426/600. It would reach Level 3 with just a little more.Shi Feng\u2019s monster grinding speed increased once more after Thundering Flash reached Level 2. The Specter Warriors fell in batches. When there were only 20 over warriors remaining, there was still an hour and a half remaining for the Quest.With another use of Thundering Flash, the last remaining 20 Specter Warriors fell as well.\u201cNot bad. Here\u2019s your reward, youngster.\u201d The elder appeared once more with a chuckle. Looking at Shi Feng, the elder took out a Fine-Gold Treasure Chest and a pitch black longsword.System: Quest \u201cPast Glory\u201d completed.

Simultaneously, title user will obtain an additional effect of Strength +5 and Endurance +5.\u201cI\u2019ve given you your reward. You can go now.\u201d The old man waved his hand after finishing his piece.Shi Feng\u2019s vision blurred. When he opened his eyes once more, he was back in the plaza of Red Leaf Town.Di! Di! Di!Shi Feng\u2019s system communication continuously rang. Blackie was contacting him.\u201cBrother Feng, you\u2019ve finally picked up. How come I couldn\u2019t contact you before? What should I do now? I\u2019m already behind others by a level.\u201d Blackie was extremely panicked. However, he still patiently asked because he believed in Shi Feng.He had wasted seven hours just to run to Red Leaf Town. While he was still at Level 0, the players that filled the streets were already Level 1.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHow was he to make up for this gap? Nobody would want him in a party now; their minimum requirement was Level 1. A Level 0 noob like him would just be pushed aside.\u201cMy bad, I was doing a Quest. Come to the central plaza, I\u2019ll take you with me to level.\u201d Shi Feng apologized.It had already been over 8 hours since God\u2019s Domain started, and Shi Feng had spent over 5 hours doing his Quest.At this stage of the game, most players had already risen to Level 1, while some professional players were already close to Level 2.As a person who had been reincarnated, helping Blackie level up was an easy task. It wouldn\u2019t take long before Blackie would catch up to the professional players.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Seeing that nobody paid attention to his sudden arrival, he quickly entered an empty alley.Opening a Fine-Gold Treasure Chest would definitely cause a commotion.Opening and showing off a Fine-Gold Treasure Chest at the crowded plaza was a bold action. It was something only noobs would do.Compared to the real world, there were no constraints within the game world. It went without saying, the great powers in the game hungered for great treasures.

Currently, he did not have the sufficient strength to protect himself, so keeping a low profile was necessary.Shi Feng quietly observed the empty alley for some time. After he made sure nobody followed him, he took out the black longsword.Shi Feng\u2019s brows wrinkled when he looked at the black longsword.[Abyssal Blade] (Magic Weapon)Job Requirement: SwordsmanDo you wish to bind the equipment?\u201cShould I equip it or not?\u201d Shi Feng became frustrated when he looked at the Abyssal Blade.Shi Feng was very familiar with Magic Weapons. Magic Weapons were different from normal equipment. They did not have any rankings to differentiate them, and they were even rarer than Legendary Equipment. Its power was without question. However, a Magic Weapon was a double-edged sword. This was because the weapon had a side effect called Backlash. If the player using the Magic Weapon was not cautious, a single mistake could cripple their account.In his previous life, there were a few experts in Star-Moon Kingdom that became top-tier experts because of Magic Weapons. Even during his peak, Shi Feng could only look up to them. However, after a period of time, two of those experts crippled their accounts because they did not deal with the Backlash properly; their only choice was to start a new account.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s just set it aside for now. I can\u2019t take the risk right now.\u201d Shi Feng shook his head as he kept the Abyssal Blade. He had to earn 16,000 Credits in ten days. The pressure on him was huge. If any mistakes were to happen, then all his efforts before would become wasted.Shi Feng took out the Fine-Gold Treasure Chest.Shi Feng looked at the gold-plated treasure chest, unable to suppress the excitement in his heart, \u201cThe Secret-Silver Treasure Chest they brought out the last time already contained a pharmaceutical recipe and blacksmithing design. I wonder what a Fine-Gold Treasure Chest would give?\u201dShi Feng had been playing God\u2019s Domain for ten years now, and the number of Fine-Gold Treasure Chests he had seen did not exceed twenty.Wars were fought over for every Fine-Gold Treasure Chest. Shi Feng would not even dare to dream that he could be in possession of one.Shi Feng slowly opened the treasure chest. Suddenly, golden rays of light leaked out from the chest, illuminating the small alley. It would definitely be a dazzling beacon of light if it was night time; it would attract everyone\u2019s attention.Not daring to take any risks, Shi Feng quickly retrieved all the items from the chest. The dazzling lights slowly faded away after the chest was emptied.Fortunately, it was an empty alley, so nobody would notice the short period of radiance.\u201cThe settings for treasure chests in God\u2019s Domain really are damned. Luckily it\u2019s daytime here.\u201d Shi Feng glanced at the treasure chest by his side, then shifted his gaze towards the three treasures in his hands.There were two ancient books and a battle armor.The battle armor was a Secret-Silver Equipment. It was much worse than Shi Feng had imagined it to be.[Sky Armor] (Secret-Silver Rank)Plate ArmorEquipment Requirement: Strength 20Equipment Level: 5Defense +25, Strength +6, Endurance +3, Agility +3Durability 30/30Additional Attribute: Power Weakening. Reduce physical damage received by 15% after equipping.Shi Feng became shocked after looking at the battle armor\u2019s attributes. Although the level of the equipment was a lot lower than the one in his previous life, its attributes were top-tier. If it was worn by a Warrior-class, the high Defense coupled with Power Weakening would make tanking physical Bosses no longer a problem. If this armor was sold now, its price would definitely be astronomical.\u201cThis is too great. Now I have armor for Level 5.\u201d Shi Feng happily stored the Sky Armor. Swordsman wore plate armor as well. When Shi Feng wore it at Level 5, he could definitely become a Shield Warrior.Shi Feng shifted his gaze to the two ancient books, becoming shocked once more when he saw their names.[Book Of Forging] and [Records Of Potions]. These two were both extremely rare treasured books.Everyone knew that Forging and Potion-making were extremely hard to learn. Every Forging Master and Potion Master were the symbols of strength of a Guild. Even Shadow, a Guild that possessed ten City States, only had two Forging Masters and five Potion Masters. Every one of them was treated like princes.With these two books, Shi Feng could create a Forging Master and a Potion Master.\u201cI remember there being a Hidden Quest in Dark Moon Valley. Not only would it teach Forging for free, it would also reward a Forging Talent. If I have both the Forging Talent and Book Of Forging, I could quickly become an Advanced Forging Apprentice. Then I could make Bronze Equipment and earn a lot of money.\u201d Shi Feng recalled a member of Shadow called Hammer Trading. The person had become a Forging Master because he completed that Hidden Quest. Dark Moon Valley was a Level 4 monster area. The Quest as well was a difficult one and would take up a lot of time.\u201cIt seems I have to buy some items and make proper preparations.\u201d Shi Feng stored the two books and sent a mail to Blackie, telling him to meet up at the Trade Area. Shi Feng then headed to the Trade Area, himself.At this time, there were quite a lot of players at the Trade Area. Players who were tired of killing monsters would come to the Trade Area to rest, having a drink and chatting. There were also players selling their loot from grinding.Shi Feng searched for an empty spot, covering the ground with a piece of white cloth. He placed down the equipment and herbs he picked, starting his stall.The Level 4 Common Cloth Armor was priced at 1 Silver 20 Coppers, while the Bronze Shield was priced at 21 Silvers. It was a fair and cheap price at this stage of the game.\u201cRare herbs, high-level equipment, those interested come and take a look.\u201d Shi Feng shouted.There were quite a number of players in the Trade Area. However, most of them were selling materials such as herbs, ore, etc. Until now, there had not been a single player selling equipment. Shi Feng\u2019s shout immediately became everyone\u2019s focus.\u201cIt can\u2019t be. There really is equipment! A Bronze Shield even!\u201d\u201cWhat unbelievable luck. I don\u2019t even have Common Equipment yet he\u2019s already got a piece of Bronze Equipment?\u201d\u201cThis is Level 5 Equipment. Is this a joke? I\u2019m not seeing things, right?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so great about it? Don\u2019t forget, there was an expert that killed the Town Mayor. That was a Level 15 Elite. Now nobody can receive a Quest from the Town Mayor. Some players that received the Town Mayor\u2019s Quest are also fuming with rage; all of them want to eat that expert alive.\u201d \u201cTwenty-one Silvers, this price is too high. I don\u2019t even have 1% of that money.\u201dThe surrounding players were all in shock. God\u2019s Domain hadn\u2019t been open for ten hours till now, yet someone could obtain such top-tier equipment. The most unbelievable part was that it was even being sold.It should be known that most Guilds and Workshops would wear the equipment they obtained, increasing their advantage as much as possible. They would definitely not sell them. Right now, players were, on average, Level 1. Level 5 equipment was something impossible to imagine, not to mention a Level 5 Bronze Shield. However, 21 Silvers was too high of a price. The income of the average player did not exceed 20 Coppers, and 21 Silvers equaled 2100 Coppers. It was an impossible price for them to shoulder.Shi Feng silently smiled as he looked at the increasing number of spectating players.He never hoped for these average players to buy it. What he wanted was the advertising effect.It was only a moment before a party of players rushed over. Leading them was a Shield Warrior.\u201cGive way, give way. Now that we, Shadow, are here, we are buying everything on the stall. Everybody else can just leave.\u201dThe party members of Shadow created a path for the Shield Warrior to walk through.Shi Feng sent them a glance, discovering that the Shield Warrior was someone he knew. The man was called Flaming Tiger; he was the Team Leader for Shadow in Red Leaf Town. In his previous life, Shi Feng was constantly used as cannon fodder, preventing him from rapidly rising. Flaming Tiger was responsible for three-tenths of that \u2018effort\u2019. Shi Feng never thought he would meet up with this man so quickly.\u201cYou the stall owner?\u201d Flaming Tiger became excited as he looked at the blue cross-shaped shield. He then looked at Shi Feng. He did not have the [Observing Eyes] skill, so he could not tell Shi Feng\u2019s level. However, Shi Feng was only clad in novice equipment, and he did not have any Guild\u2019s insignia on him. He was definitely just an average player. Obtaining such equipment should be due to good luck.Shi Feng nodded his head saying, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cGood, I want everything here for 1 Silver.\u201d Flaming Tiger proudly stated.He said it as if everything on the stall was just unworthy garbage, and that giving 1 Silver for them was looking up to one.\u201cI don\u2019t negotiate prices. Please don\u2019t hinder my business by acting like a lord.\u201d Shi Feng did not get angry, choosing to ignore Flaming Tiger. At this moment, Flaming Tiger\u2019s face became livid. He glared at Shi Feng, coldly saying, \u201cAre you sure you want to oppose us, Shadow? I\u2019ll give you one more chance, think carefully before you speak.\u201dSuddenly, all five other members of Shadow surrounded Shi Feng.Shi Feng rolled his eyes at Flaming Tiger, saying in a straightforward manner, \u201cFools.\u201dHe actually dared to threaten Shi Feng inside Red Leaf Town. Did he not know it was prohibited to take action inside a town?\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d Flaming Tiger raged, both his eyes turning blood red. He couldn\u2019t help but want to kill Shi Feng right this instant.\u201cHahaha, truly interesting. A Level 5 Bronze Shield. How could us Assassin\u2019s Alliance be left out.\u201dAnother group of over ten players came at this moment. Every player wore the Assassin\u2019s Alliance\u2019s insignia. The person who spoke up was Stabbing Heart. He became shocked when he saw the stall owner.He did not expect to see Shi Feng, the expert who had cleared the Bronze Prize Challenge in a single try. Shi Feng had even obtained a Level 5 Bronze Shield now, so he had definitely killed a high leveled Elite monster. Stabbing Heart became even more respectful of Shi Feng.\u201cHere\u2019s 24 Silver, I want everything here. Let\u2019s become friends. The next time you have any good equipment, you must consider us, Assassin\u2019s Alliance.\u201d Stabbing Heart handed over the 24 Silvers without hesitation. Although it was not easy for the Guild to collect these 24 Silvers, it was definitely worth it if he could become friends with an expert like Shi Feng.\u201cAlright. Since you\u2019re so straightforward, I won\u2019t ask for the 50 Coppers anymore. I\u2019ll contact you in the future.\u201d Shi Feng understood Stabbing Heart\u2019s intention. It wasn\u2019t a bad deal if he could cooperate with such a large Guild.Meanwhile, the surrounding players were shocked by Assassin Alliance\u2019s overwhelming aire, handing over 24 Silvers without batting an eye. Now, this was a large Guild. Such an action had made a lot of players wanting to sign up for the Guild. Compared to the Assassin\u2019s Alliance, there was no future in joining a Guild like Shadow. Everybody sent looks of contempt over to them.After being looked down upon by Shi Feng, then being given a slap by the Assassin\u2019s Alliance, Flaming Tiger\u2019s face became beet red. His eyes nearly crackled from anger. He called over an Assassin, coldly saying, \u201cQuiet Wolf, you keep an eye on that kid. I\u2019ll let him know what happens when he opposes Shadow.\u201dOn the other side, Shi Feng had long since left the scene. He was currently purchasing items around the Trade Area.He now held 24 Silvers on his person. It was an amount even greater than the total wealth of an average guild. Now that Shi Feng was an absolute tycoon, he started buying things without a single care.He bought 20 bottles of Black Steel Beer, each costing 25 Coppers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe bought 30 Smoke Bombs, each costing 20 Coppers.He bought 100 Apple Pies, each costing 5 Coppers. Eating it recovered 30 HP every second, lasting 10 seconds.He bought 100 Magic Water, each costing 5 Coppers. Drinking it recovered 30 MP every second, lasting 10 seconds.Shi Feng spent a lot of his wealth within an instant, leaving him with only 3 Silvers.\u201cBrother Feng, you\u2019ve finally decided to show up. What are we going to do now?\u201d Blackie had been waiting in the Trade Area for some time now. He wore a dark expression on his face, and his eyes were filled with resentment. God\u2019s Domain had already been open for over 9 hours now. Aside from obtaining an [Explorer] title, Blackie did not obtain anything else. He was nearing the point of dying from depression.\u201cLet\u2019s go grind some monsters then.\u201d Shi Feng smiled, sending Blackie a party request.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11 \u2013 Black Steel BeerAfter leaving Red Leaf Town\u2026Shi Feng brought Blackie along as they headed straight towards Dark Moon Valley.\u201cBrother Feng, we\u2019re on the path towards Dark Moon Valley. That\u2019s a Level 4 monster area. Can\u2019t we choose a safer place?\u201d Seeing that Shi Feng\u2019s target was Level 4 monsters, Blackie couldn\u2019t help but ask nervously.Challenging higher levels in God\u2019s Domain was extremely difficult. Usually, players would just challenge monsters that are one level higher than themselves. Challenging monsters two levels higher required at least a 6-man party for it to be possible. However, even 6-man parties wouldn\u2019t carry out such an action. Compared to exhausting themselves just to kill a single Level 3 monster, it was much more efficient to just kill a Level 2 monster.Shi Feng and Blackie were only two people. Ignoring Shi Feng, who was a Level 2 Swordsman, Blackie himself was still a Level 0 Cursemancer. He was just free food to a Level 4 monster. Going against Level 4 monsters just with the two of them was utterly suicide\u2026\u2026Shi Feng only smiled regarding Blackie\u2019s worries. He securely said, \u201cRelax, can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m already Level 2? That friend of mine is an expert Beta Tester. If it weren\u2019t for our good relation, he wouldn\u2019t even tell me such a secret. You can just wait to get on the leveling rocket.\u201dShi Feng pushed all the problems that came with him being a reincarnated person onto his \u2018good friend\u2019. Now all his actions in God\u2019s Domain could be easily answered, too. He also didn\u2019t have to explain much since Blackie would easily believe him.This was because a Beta Tester was the best explanation.\u201cAs expected of Brother Feng, you\u2019re still the greatest. No wonder you didn\u2019t join Shadow Workshop to earn money. With an expert Beta Tester giving you pointers, you could definitely earn a lot of money in God\u2019s Domain. The happiness of my body\u2019s lower half will depend on you now.\u201d Blackie laughingly said as he became relieved.When joined the party before, he was very surprised to see Shi Feng already at Level 2.Currently, there had yet to be any news of a Level 2 player in Red Leaf Town. Even elites of a Workshop were no exception. However, Shi Feng had reached it. His leveling speed was absolutely terrifying.Blackie knew about Shi Feng\u2019s standards. Although his skills weren\u2019t bad, he definitely wasn\u2019t that good. Before, Blackie still had some suspicions about the news of the Beta Tester. However, all his worries disappeared after seeing Shi Feng\u2019s level, because only a Beta Tester could make something like this happen. Blackie had also started believing the possibility of Shi Feng earning 16,000 Credits in ten days.\u201cScram! This brother\u2019s straight!\u201d Shi Feng rolled his eyes at Blackie, slightly widening the distance between them. However, Blackie\u2019s gaze still carried some impurities, causing Shi Feng to panic slightly.\u201cWhat are you thinking, Brother Feng? My dream lover is the Snow Goddess, Gentle Snow.\u201d Blackie hurriedly explained.The Snow Goddess?Shi Feng had a very deep impression of this woman. She had performed extremely outstanding in other virtual games. Not only did she possess an absolutely beautiful face and devilish body, but she also had a proud attitude which was backed up by her excellent battle techniques. Because of these traits, she became even better received by the public.After three years since God\u2019s Domain\u2019s opening, she had become a top-tier expert within the whole country. She was also the top ten Berserker within the country. She was dubbed as the Battle Goddess. She had starred in plenty of commercials. Her personal net worth at that time had exceeded tens of billions of Credits. Not only that, but she was also the Vice Guild Leader of \u2018Ouroboros\u2019; millions of players would move with her single command. During those times, Shi Feng was only a minor character within God\u2019s Domain. He could only look up to Gentle Snow\u2019s shadow. Unfortunately, sometime later, Gentle Snow suddenly vanished from God\u2019s Domain. Her disappearance became a hot topic within God\u2019s Domain for some time.\u201cBrother Feng, look. That\u2019s an Elite monster.\u201d Blackie pointed towards a snow-white fox in the distant paddy field as he shouted.Shi Feng looked over to the golden fields, discovering a white colored fox. There was even a little rabbit in the fox\u2019s mouth right now.[Cunning Snow Fox] (Rare Elite)Level 2HP 450\u201cBlackie, your eyesight and luck are seriously too good. You even spotted a Rare Elite. We\u2019re going to earn a fortune this time.\u201d Shi Feng stealthily walked closer to the fox as he directed Blackie, \u201cYou just attack from a distance and leave the rest to me.\u201dRare Elites were a special type of Elite. They had the same capabilities as a normal Elite monster, but the rewards they give out were a lot greater. It would take a long time for it to respawn after being killed. Whether you could meet one depended on your luck.\u201cBrother Feng, you must be crazy. That\u2019s a Level 2 Elite. We can\u2019t go against it.\u201dBlackie wanted to stop Shi Feng. Only a small party of the same level could deal with an Elite. Fighting one alone, without any healing, would definitely lead to death.However, Blackie was too late. Shi Feng had quickly circled to the Snow Fox\u2019s back, launching a sudden attack.Chop!A sword strike flew.The Snow Fox\u2019s actions were very nimble. It immediately avoided a vital hit to its abdomen, taking only 32 damage.\u201cSuch nimble actions. Its Defense isn\u2019t low either.\u201d Shi Feng made a quick judgment after observing how the Snow Fox dodged and took damage.He had the Might Of A Thousand title, so all his attributes were increased by 10%. There was also an additional 5 points to both Strength and Endurance, increasing his Strength to 13 and Endurance to 10. His Agility was also increased to 17 points. Now his Attack Power was 29, and he had 260 HP.With great speeds, the enraged Snow Fox bit towards Shi Feng\u2019s neck. It activated the skill [Fatal Blow].However, with 17 Agility, Shi Feng\u2019s speed was not any slower than the Snow Fox. By the time the Snow Fox had rushed over, Shi Feng\u2019s Novice Sword had already struck down towards the fox\u2019s head.Peng!Shi Feng only had 13 points of Strength; it was still not enough to block the Snow Fox\u2019s attack. Forty-nine damage appeared above Shi Feng\u2019s head, and his Novice Sword\u2019s durability decreased by 1 point, as well.On the other hand, the Snow Fox only received 5 damage. The gap between the two of them was as clear as day.\u201cWe\u2019re dead! We\u2019re dead! We\u2019re so dead this time.\u201d Sweat started appearing on Blackie\u2019s forehead. He had seen damage from Common monsters, but he never imagined that there was such a great difference from an Elite monster. Shi Feng was lucky he had blocked the attack with his sword, only taking close to 50 damage. If the attack landed on his body, wouldn\u2019t it be over a hundred? Shi Feng had reached Level 2 with great difficulty. If he died this time, he would return to Level 1; his great advantage over others would be gone.\u201cMove, Blackie!\u201d Shi Feng shouted.\u201cHe really must\u2019ve gone mad. Fine! Fine, at worst I\u2019ll just die once. I\u2019m still Level 0, anyway. Blackie clenched his teeth and started chanting a curse, his hands making gestures.A [Dark Arrow] shot out, dealing 5 damage to the Snow Fox.Blackie sucked in a deep breath when he saw the damage. He had added all his points into Intelligence, yet 5 damage was all he could do. An Elite monster\u2019s Defense was just terrifying.Shi Feng who was facing the Snow Fox was under even more pressure. The Snow Fox had very high Agility. It was able to dodge whenever Shi Feng wanted to use Chop. In the end, Shi Feng could only use normal slashes, dealing 18 damage each time. However, each successful bite from the Snow Fox would deal over a hundred damage; it was greatly disproportionate.Tens seconds later, Shi Feng\u2019s HP fell to 31, while the Snow Fox still had 244.\u201cI guess there\u2019s still no way to directly face off against an Agility-type Elite with such a small amount of Skills.\u201d Shi Feng looked at the Snow Fox\u2019s half-remaining HP. If he continued to drag on this fight, he would be the one to die. He had to start bursting.Shi Feng took out a bottle of Black Steel Beer from his bag. After taking two mouthfuls, he became slightly drunk, and his vision started becoming blurry. He then activated Gravity Liberation, his speed increasing by a huge leap. He arrived at the Snow Fox\u2019s side with lightning speed.When Shi Feng looked at the Snow Fox\u2019s level again, it displayed Level 0, whereas he was Level 2. Suddenly, the suppression due to level difference was removed, letting Shi Feng\u2019s damage rise. Similarly, however, his body became difficult to control.\u201cDie!\u201d Shi Feng\u2019s eyes were icy cold, his grip around the Novice Sword tightened.Thundering Flash!Hua! Hua! Hua!Three lightning quick slashes struck past the Snow Fox\u2019s waist, causing it to let out a tragic cry. Damages of -30, -36, -42 appeared on top of its head, instantly taking away a quarter of its HP.Afterward, another Chop dealt 43 damage to it.The Snow Fox desperately resisted, but Shi Feng\u2019s speed after activating Gravity Liberation was very fast. Even if he was in a drunken state, with his many years of battle experiences, Shi Feng could still easily maneuver his body. This had placed the Snow Fox at an absolute disadvantage.\u201cDamn, what did you drink, Brother Feng? You\u2019re suddenly so fierce!\u201d Blackie\u2019s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets as he saw Shi Feng\u2019s cheat-like performance. At this moment, the fierce Snow Fox had become Shi Feng\u2019s plaything. It had zero chance at resisting.When the Snow Fox had 42 HP remaining, Shi Feng was about to give the last strike.Suddenly, Shi Feng felt a shiver going down the back of his neck. It was as if he had a dagger pointed at his neck; it was a terrible feeling. Shi Feng instinctively leaped forward. In the next moment, a bright snowy dagger had slashed across his original position. Shi Feng had surprisingly avoided that strike.Behind Shi Feng, a figure with an extremely surprised expression revealed himself. He had already kept his presence hidden incredibly well; he did not even let out a single sound. Not only that, after he had raised to Level 1, his Agility had reached 10 points. However, his sneak attack had actually been dodged. What sort of intuition did Shi Feng have?\u201cFriend, we have no hatred or enmity between us. It isn\u2019t good doing something like this.\u201d Shi Feng focused his gaze on the newly appeared Assassin as he coldly said so.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIf you wish to place blame, then blame yourself for angering us Shadow. It is too late even if you regret it now.\u201d Quiet Wolf said excitedly. He held his dagger in reverse grip, paying attention to Shi Feng\u2019s every movement.Quiet Wolf had been following Shi Feng while also reporting his location. He never imagined that they would meet an Elite monster. The Snow Fox\u2019s current target was Shi Feng. Although Shi Feng had good skills, with the Snow Fox holding him back Quiet Wolf could definitely find a chance to kill of Shi Feng\u2019s remaining strand of life, then he could kill the Snow Fox. There were only benefits for him. As for the Cursemancer on the side, he was just garbage that was not even worth mentioning.Naturally, the Snow Fox wouldn\u2019t care about any of this. It just knew that it had to kill Shi Feng.The Snow Fox suddenly bellowed, its snow-white skin turning into a flaming red. Its body also increased in size and its HP rose by 20%. Then, the Snow Fox activated its final skill [Tearing Bite]. The skill amplified its damage by 50%, also causing a bleeding damage of 30, lasting for 5 seconds.\u201cYou can go and regret, now! I\u2019ll take care of this Snow Fox in your stead.\u201d Quiet Wolf rushed at Shi Feng. He was prepared to kill off Shi Feng the moment he dodged the Snow Fox.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Duration of one hour. Any players who attack Yellow Name players will not receive any penalty.Shi Feng only had 31 HP remaining. Being attacked from both sides by the Snow Fox and Quiet Wolf, put Shi Feng in a very dangerous position.\u201cDespicable!\u201dStanding at a distance, Blackie scolded Quiet Wolf for sneaking an attack at such a moment. However, he couldn\u2019t change a thing about it. The two of them were too far apart. It was too hard for him to land a hit on Quiet Wolf. He could only aim his attack on the Snow Fox, hoping to kill it off a second earlier and not letting Quiet Wolf profit off of them.Although mages had high output, compared to hitting monsters, it was far harder to land a hit on players unless they stood still without moving.This was because the moment the Dark Arrow shot out, there would be a prediction line appearing. In a situation where the distance was great, players with good standards could usually dodge it. If it was an expert, then dodging it would be a piece of cake.Just as the Snow Fox and Quiet Wolf were about to rush up\u2026The corners of Shi Feng\u2019s mouth revealed a cold smile. He had been interacting with Quiet Wolf in Shadow for years now, so he was extremely familiar with Quiet Wolf\u2019s strengths and habits. Shi Feng took two steps back, forming a perfect triangle between the Snow Fox and Quiet Wolf. Shi Feng gripped the Novice Sword tightly in front of his chest. He stood there without moving as he awaited the arrival of their attacks.\u201cDid he give up?\u201dQuiet Wolf started looking down on Shi Feng when he saw Shi Feng preparing to block with his sword. Although players could reduce the damage received by defending the attack, the Snow Fox was an Elite. Even if Shi Feng could defend it, the attack would still cause around 50 damage. With just 31 HP remaining, Shi Feng couldn\u2019t even take a hit.The Snow Fox was a step ahead, biting towards Shi Feng.Tearing Bite!\u201cJust in time.\u201d Instead of retreating, Shi Feng advanced. He rushed towards the Snow Fox.The Novice Sword blocked the Snow Fox in its mouth. Using the lifesaving skill Parry, Shi Feng could block a frontal attack once. Shi Feng then continued by lifting the Snow Fox. The Snow Fox had low power, so Shi Feng had easily tossed it towards Quiet Wolf.Everything happened too quickly.Quiet Wolf who was rushing towards Shi Feng could not react in time. In an instant, his shoulder was bitten by the Snow Fox.A damage of -164 appeared on Quiet Wolf\u2019s head. His HP was instantly cleared down to zero.\u201cHow?\u201d Quiet Wolf was unbelievably shocked. His heart was filled with unwillingness as he stared at Shi Feng\u2019s ridiculing smile. He never imagined that players could do such a thing. If he had known about it, he definitely wouldn\u2019t rush forward, just to get himself killed.At this point, regardless of how unwilling Quiet Wolf was, his HP had turned to 0. His body could only fall and turn into starlight. He had even dropped a piece of equipment.In the distance, Blackie became dumbfounded. He had even forgotten to attack the Snow Fox.\u201cBlackie, stop daydreaming! Hurry up and attack the Snow Fox!\u201d Shi Feng yelled and rushed at the Snow Fox again.After Blackie started reacting again, he chanted a curse, madly attacking the Snow Fox.Without Quiet Wolf\u2019s disturbance, the near-death Snow Fox was just a decoration. Within 10 seconds, the Snow Fox released a wail before falling down.System: [Rare Elite] Cunning Snow Fox killed. Obtained 130 EXP.Shi Feng was Level 2 now, so this amount of EXP was nothing to him. What Shi Feng was concerned about was the loot. Rare Elites were the love of all God\u2019s Domain players because of their shocking drop rates. Furthermore, this was the First Kill of the Snow Fox, so the loot must be even better.\u201cIt can\u2019t be. It actually dropped a weapon.\u201d Shi Feng obtained a Staff an Armguard.[Blackwood Staff] (Bronze Rank)Level 1Equipment Requirements: Strength 5Attack Power +8Intelligence +3, Vitality +1, Mana +30Durability 20/20This equipment would greatly strengthen a mage. Not only was its Attack Power high, it even gave an additional 3 Intelligence. If a mage equipped it, then their damage might increase up to two levels.[Fox Skin Gloves] (Common Rank, Leather Armor)Level 1Equipment Requirements: Strength 3Defense +4Durability 20/20On the other hand, Quiet Wolf had contributed a pair of Level 0 Common Leathered Shoes with +3 Defense.\u201cAnd here I thought it was some Gray Trash Equipment. It seems Quiet Wolf\u2019s luck isn\u2019t that bad, being able to obtain a piece of Common Equipment.\u201d Shi Feng had a different view of Quiet Wolf now. Obtaining a piece of Common Equipment at the starting period of the game definitely depended on luck. However, Quiet Wolf\u2019s luck now benefited Shi Feng instead. Swordsmen could wear both Plate Armor and Cloth Armor. Now that Shi Feng had two of these new items, his Defense had increased by a lot.\u201cBlackie, your equipment.\u201d Shi Feng passed the Blackwood Staff to Blackie.However, Blackie did not receive the equipment. He had a hesitant look on his face. Killing the Snow Fox depended entirely on Shi Feng. Blackie wasn\u2019t of much help, yet he had received the best equipment; a piece of Bronze Equipment no less. At this stage of the game, there weren\u2019t many players capable of owning such an item. It was extremely valuable.\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you; aren\u2019t we good brothers? Why are you being courteous with me? Besides, you\u2019re a Cursemancer. Once you\u2019ve reached Level 1, you can fully exert the staff\u2019s greatest capabilities. With that, we can level even faster.\u201d Shi Feng said in a serious tone as if he knew what Blackie was thinking.After some thought, Blackie was able to make sense of it. He no longer refused it, saying, \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll definitely use it properly.\u201d\u201cNow. that\u2019s much better.\u201d Shi Feng laughed, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re going to Dark-Moon Valley.\u201dRed Leaf Town.\u201cQuiet Wolf, what were you even doing? Not only did you die, you\u2019ve even dropped a piece of expensive Equipment. Do you know how precious that Equipment is?\u201d Flaming Tiger snapped as he cursed.Quiet Wolf\u2019s expression was as gloomy as dark water. That pair of shoes was something he had obtained after grinding for 7 hours, and now he had actually lost it. Even his heart was bleeding right now. Although he had wanted to explain, he did not know how to. Should he say how he was toyed with by Shi Feng? That wasn\u2019t something he was willing to admit. However, even if he wanted to snatch the equipment back, he wasn\u2019t an opponent for Shi Feng.\u201cBrother Tiger, I discovered a Rare Elite in the wild. I didn\u2019t think I would be discovered by that kid when I was about to kill off the Elite. That kid had even brought along another person. In a one versus three situation, I wasn\u2019t their opponent at all.\u201d Quiet Wolf pretended to be enraged as he turned black into white. He continuously tempted Flaming Tiger. \u201cThat brat should have killed the Rare Elite by now. He must\u2019ve obtained some good equipment. They were on the path towards Dark Moon Valley. We could still catch up to them if we chase after them. We might even be able to get back the equipment.\u201d\u201cRare Elite!?\u201d Flaming Tiger\u2019s eyes started to shine. He no longer questioned Quiet Wolf. Instead, he was extremely interested in the loot of the Rare Elite. He said excitedly. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll immediately chase after them. They actually dare to steal my equipment. I will make them regret even playing God\u2019s Domain.\u201dWithin a short moment, Flaming Tiger gathered all the members of Shadow Workshop present in Red Leaf Town. He brought along 11 Workshop members and rushed towards Dark Moon Valley. No matter what, he wanted to kill off Shi Feng and obtain his equipment.At this moment, Shi Feng and Blackie had already arrived at Dark Moon Valley.There was a smithy beside the flowing creek. Shi Feng and Blackie quietly stood in front of it. They were looking at a barechested, middle-aged uncle. In his hand, the man wielded a steel hammer. Ding! Dang! He kept hammering on the crimson red ore.Time slowly flowed by, bit by bit.\u201cBrother Feng, are we still going to wait? It\u2019s already been half an hour now.\u201d Blackie said.\u201cWe have to wait. Without patience, he won\u2019t give us the Quest.\u201d Shi Feng affirmed.In his previous life, Hammer Trading had passed by this place on accident. He had discovered a smithy here. However, the blacksmith here didn\u2019t pay any attention to him regardless of how Hammer Trading talked to him. This had enraged Hammer Trading, so he decided to drag it on with the blacksmith. He kept standing to the side, sending death glares to the blacksmith. He had never imagined that after some time, the blacksmith would actively speak up. Not only that, the blacksmith even gave out a Hidden Quest. This had allowed Hammer Trading to learn the Forging Talent, becoming the Forging Master of the era.When Shi Feng thought about obtaining the Forging Talent, coupling it with the Book Of Forging, advancing into an Advanced Forging Apprentice became a very easy task. When that time came, Gold Coins would rain into his pockets.After waiting for more than ten minutes\u2026\u201cDo you two have an interested in Forging?\u201d The middle-aged blacksmith suddenly asked.\u201cYes, sir. We\u2019ve loved Forging since we were young.\u201d Shi Feng immediately said.The middle-aged blacksmith nodded his head, saying in a satisfied tone, \u201cThen since you love Forging, I can teach it to you. But first, could you help me retrieve 100 pieces of Meteorite Ore? They can be found on the West side of Crimson Star Mine.\u201d\u201cOf course. We would gladly be at your service.\u201d Shi Feng respectfully answered.System: Hidden Quest \u2018Road Of Forging\u2019 accepted. Player is requested by Forging Master Jack to obtain 100 pieces of Meteorite Ore from Crimson Star Mine.Crimson Star Mine was the nest of Level 4 Kobolds. These monsters loved ore the most. They would spend everyday mining within the mines. As such, Kobolds were born with great strength. However, they had short limbs. Because they stayed underground for long periods of time, their range of vision was short. They could only detect enemies within a 35-yard distance. This distance was also the maximum range of attack for a mage.At the mine\u2019s entrance, there were many Kobolds walking around. An entire group of them would be attracted even if only one of them was attacked.[Kobold]Level 4HP 420\u201cHere. First, some food and drink to fill ourselves. We\u2019ll start work after that.\u201d Shi Feng brought out a Black Steel Beer and an Apple Pie.Blackie didn\u2019t understand what Shi Feng was trying to do, but since it was Shi Feng\u2019s request, he must have his own reasons. Blackie sat down and started eating.Ten seconds after eating the Apple Pie, all of Blackie\u2019s attributes were suddenly increased by +1 points, the effect lasting 30 minutes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter drinking the Black Steel Beer, Blackie\u2019s vision started becoming hazy. When he looked at the distant Level 4 Kobolds, their Levels were suddenly reduced by 2; becoming Level 2.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s start then. A bottle of Black Steel Beer\u2019s drunken effect only lasts 30 minutes.\u201d Shi Feng stood up. He took out a Smoke Bomb and walked closer to the mine\u2019s entrance. Then, he threw it at the group of Level 4 Kobolds; there were currently over ten of them there.[Smoke Bomb]Able to reduce the visibility in a radius of 10 by 10 yards. Duration of one hour.The Smoke Bomb was able to reduce a monster\u2019s vision by 10 yards. It wasn\u2019t particularly useful against other monsters. However, it was great when facing Kobolds. Their vision was now reduced to 25 yards. As long as a mage attacked from a 30-yard distance, the Kobolds would not be able to spot them at all. They could only stand there and wait for their deaths.\u201cAttack.\u201d Shi Feng pointed to the Kobolds within the smoke.Blackie was half-doubting Shi Feng\u2019s actions, but he still chose to believe in Shi Feng. His mouth started chanting a curse. A moment later, a Dark Arrow shot out, landing directly on the foremost Kobold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13 \u2013 Blackie\u2019s Good LuckThe Kobold within the smoke was hit, 21 damage appearing above his head.The Kobold became furious after being inexplicably attacked. Like a searchlight, the Kobold looked around in all directions with his blood red eyes. Such an action had also caused the other Kobolds to start being on guard.Within the forest, Blackie\u2019s heartbeat kept on speeding up. He was extremely panicked.Although the Kobolds looked to be Level 2, their Attributes 100% belonged to a Level 4. Drinking the Black Steel Beer allowed a player to become drunk, significantly increasing the player\u2019s courage. As a result, all enemies seen by the player would have their Levels reduced by 2. However, this would not reduce the Kobolds\u2019 Attributes.If these Kobolds came rushing at them, only death awaited Shi Feng and Blackie.Yet, Blackie\u2019s worries were for naught.The attacked Kobold looked at its surroundings. However, it did not discover any enemies. After whining for a bit, it returned to its original state. The other Kobolds also stopped paying attention to their deranged companion as they continued walking about.\u201cRelax. They won\u2019t attack us as long as you maintain a 30-yard distance.\u201d Shi Feng clapped Blackie\u2019s shoulders as he confidently commented.He had been planning all this ahead of time. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have spent that much money buying all those items.Blackie became even more courageous after Shi Feng\u2019s encouragement. He continuously chanted curses and shot out Dark Arrows.The Kobold only had 420 HP, and it couldn\u2019t withstand Blackie\u2019s bombardment at all. After receiving more than twenty Dark Arrows, it breathed its final breath. Meanwhile, the other Kobolds by its side did not show any reaction at all.Blackie became excited when he saw the first Kobold fall.He had killed a monster 4 levels higher. Although the EXP was shared due to being in a two-man party, the amount of EXP he received was still plenty. His experience had risen by 5% within an instant.This meant that Blackie would level up after killing 20 Kobolds. He was even safe and unharmed. If the monsters did not disappear completely, their leveling speed would be terrifying. With such a great way of leveling, they would be able to rise even to Level 6 very effectively. Blackie now understood why Shi Feng was so confident. Even if they had wasted several hours from traveling, being able to grind on monsters here was definitely worth it.After a while, the group of twenty or so Kobolds in front of the mine\u2019s entrance was cleared out completelyBlackie had also raised to Level 1. After he equipped the Blackwood Staff and added all his Free Ability Points into Intelligence, his damage was increased by a large leap. He could now take away 45 HP from the Kobolds in a single hit.Meanwhile, the group of Kobolds had dropped 12 Copper Coins and a Level 3 Common Cloth Armor. There were also 5 pieces of Meteorite Ore. Blackie\u2019s luck was quite good.According to what Shi Feng had known, the drop rate of Meteorite Ore from the Kobolds was not high; only one would drop out of ten of them. Nearly 1000 Kobolds needed to be killed to obtain 100 pieces of Meteorite Ore. Now, however, just a group Kobolds had given them 5 pieces of Meteorite Ore.After storing the drops, Shi Feng went on to lure more monsters. With the advantage of his 16 Agility, Shi Feng\u2019s speed was faster than the Kobolds. Within moments, he had lured over 30 Kobolds. He also maintained the distance of around 20-yards, but not exceeding 25-yards. When he had lured all the Kobolds into the smoke cloud, Shi Feng increased his speed abruptly. He quickly distanced himself over 25-yards from the Kobolds, causing them to lose their target. After losing their target, the Kobolds stood on the spot in a daze.Blackie who stood over 30 yards away took the chance to attack.The group of over 30 Kobolds took less than ten minutes to be cleared. They dropped another 21 Coppers and 6 pieces of Meteorite Ore. Shi Feng and Blackie\u2019s experience also greatly increased.In such a way, Shi Feng continued luring monsters while Blackie continued dealing damage. Although the process felt mechanical and boring, Blackie was not complaining one tiny bit. On the contrary, he became even more vigorous with each kill. He wished he could just kill all day without resting.After an hour, Blackie\u2019s level had also risen to Level 2. His Dark Arrow rose to Level 3, and his damage went from more than 40 to more than 60. Such a rocket-like leveling speed made him speechlessly happy, giving him even more motivation to aim for Level 3.Their Kobold-killing efficiency also increased by quite a bit with Blackie\u2019s greatly improved damage. The only downside was the increase in MP consumption following the Dark Arrow\u2019s level up. Fortunately, there was the Magic Water that Shi Feng had bought. With it, Blackie could fully regenerate his MP before Shi Feng had lured a new group of monsters, allowing him to deal damage without pause.Meanwhile, Shi Feng was observing Blackie\u2019s condition while he lured a suitable number of Kobolds. Other than that, he was just picking up the loot. The number of Copper Coins and Meteorite Ore were steadily increasing.After another hour of Blackie\u2019s effort, they had managed to collect 73 pieces of Meteorite Ore, 6 pieces of Common Equipment, and 264 Coppers. They would be able to gather the remaining Meteorite Ore if they grinded for another hour.The system notification rang out just at this moment.System: Player Lonely Snow has sent you 10 Coppers.Subsequently, Shi Feng received a communication request. The person contacting him was Lonely Snow.\u201cYou are?\u201d Shi Feng had just finished luring a group of monsters. Since he had nothing to do, he accepted the call request.\u201cHello, Brother Expert. I\u2019m Lonely Snow. We met before at the Town Hall, and you\u2019ve even pointed me to a grinding spot. That place was just too great. There wasn\u2019t anybody stealing mobs from me, and I could also easily handle them. I\u2019m already Level 2 now. I\u2019ve also looted a lot of materials and Copper coins. I\u2019ve already mailed you the 10 Coppers. I wonder if you\u2019ve received it.\u201d Lonely Snow was extremely excited. Previously, he was worried that this expert would not bother with him any longer. This was because experts were usually very proud; they wouldn\u2019t even look at minor characters like him. Lonely Snow had earned over 60 Coppers from that treasured location he purchased. His level had even risen to Level 2, leading the other players by quite a lot. Spending 20 Coppers for this were definitely worth it.\u201cSo it was you. I\u2019ve received the 10 Coppers.\u201d Shi Feng only remembered about it after being reminded. Indeed there was such a matter. However, that was when he needed the money to kill the Town Mayor a little earlier, so he had just casually given out some pointers. He didn\u2019t really mind regarding the remaining 10 Coppers.\u201cBrother Expert, the Level 2 Dungeon [Deathly Forest] has already been opened, so I wanted to invite you to dive into the Dungeon. My friends are all veterans, and they\u2019re all Level 2 now. They will definitely not drag you down. Of course, all Swordsman Equipment obtained from the Dungeon will belong to you. Do you perhaps have the time?\u201d Lonely Snow was slightly nervous. Experts usually disdained bringing along other people, especially rookie newbies. It was the reason why Lonely Snow mentioned that there were Level 2 veterans in the party; he was afraid Shi Feng would just outright reject him.Deathly Forest?Shi Feng had a deep impression of this Dungeon. As long as the number of Level 2 players in Red Leaf Town reaches a certain amount, the first Level 2 Dungeon in Red Leaf Town, [Deathly Forest] would be opened.Along with the Deathly Forest\u2019s opening, players of God\u2019s Domain were made known to the difficulty of Dungeons. Deathly Forest was only conquered after many players had reached Level 4 or 5.Meanwhile, Deathly Forest\u2019s true purpose was to increase the number of skills a player could possess. The monsters within the dungeon mainly dropped the basic skill books for every Job. However, the most precious item within the Dungeon was the forging design. Only the Final Boss, Werewolf Felot dropped it with a very low probability.Shi Feng was very interested in this forging design. If he could learn it, then he would be able to further progress in his plans.\u201cFine. However, I have a condition of my own. I will be bringing a Cursemancer, so all Cursemancer and Swordsman equipment will belong to me. Also, I want all materials and design papers that the Boss drops. If you all are willing to agree to this condition then I can go with you.\u201d Shi Feng had just casually asked for the majority of the profits. However, he did not feel anything wrong with it.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d Lonely Snow started sweating all over after hearing Shi Feng\u2019s condition. As expected, an expert\u2019s asking price was definitely high. However, when Lonely Snow considered the strengths of a Beta Tester, he still reluctantly agreed, \u201cAlright then, I agree. I\u2019ll tell it to the others. Expert, when will you be free to come?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll meet at the Dungeon\u2019s entrance in another two or so hours.\u201d Shi Feng estimated Blackie\u2019s killing speed. In over an hour, they would definitely be able to finish gathering the 100 pieces of Meteorite Ore.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Then I\u2019ll start preparing over here. I\u2019ll see you at the Dungeon\u2019s entrance, Brother Expert.\u201d Lonely Snow ended the call, a heavy weight being freed from him.At this moment, there were three other people standing beside Lonely Snow. Every one of them was Level 2.\u201cWhat did that expert say?\u201d a handsome Ranger asked.Lonely Snow explained it to them word for word.\u201cWhat dog\u2019s fart expert? He\u2019s just here to take advantage and rip off equipment from us. What\u2019s the point of inviting him? If we add another two damage dealers, we can enter the Dungeon all the same.\u201d a Shield Warrior angrily cursed.The male Cleric standing at a side curled his lips, saying in a bad mood, \u201cThen he\u2019s saying that all mage-class equipment belongs to his friend.\u201dLonely Snow advised, \u201cThat person is a real expert. He\u2019s also a Beta Tester. He definitely has a deep understanding of the Dungeon. He might even be able to guide us through it. Don\u2019t you all want to clear the Deathly Forest?\u201d\u201cSo, what if he\u2019s a Beta Tester? He just had an extra month of experience in God\u2019s Domain and a rough understanding of it. Besides, the data has long been changed after the game\u2019s official release. Even if he knew a lot about the Deathly Forest, how much use could there be?\u201d The Shield Warrior asked in disdain. He felt that those Beta Testers were only lucky. Their actual skills and strength might not even be comparable to them.\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes after they arrive. If it\u2019s no good, then by that time there will be a lot more Level 2 players. It won\u2019t be too late, even if we find someone else by then.\u201d The leading Ranger said.After hearing this Ranger speak, the others nodded their heads in agreement.At this moment, there was a flash of light in Dark Moon Valley.Shi Feng had finally raised to Level 3. Unfortunately, the leaderboard for levels had yet to be opened. Otherwise, he would definitely be ranked first on Red Leaf Town\u2019s leaderboard for levels.\u201cFinally Level 3.\u201d Shi Feng hurriedly added 4 attribute points towards Agility, letting his Agility reach 20 points.System: Player\u2019s Agility has reached 20 points. Activating Agility Hidden Basic Skill [Fast And Nimble].[Fast And Nimble] (Active)When activated, possess a body exceeding the normal man.Body\u2019s degree of freedom is completely released.Shi Feng suddenly felt a gush of strength from his entire body. He also felt his body becoming unspeakably agile. His five senses also received a great improvement. These improvements allowed Shi Feng to better exert his body\u2019s potential.Besides Shi Feng reaching Level 3, the last Kobold that Blackie killed had unexpectedly dropped a Level 1 Bronze Equipment: Warboots.Shi Feng couldn\u2019t help but admire Blackie\u2019s luck. Common monsters of Level 1 to 3 would not drop any Bronze Equipment. The drop rate of Bronze Equipment from Level 4 wild monsters was one out of ten thousand. Yet Blackie had actually got it; his luck was just heaven defying.\u201cBrother Feng, what are the attributes? Let me see as well!\u201d Blackie said so excitedly.\u201cThe Warboots\u2019 attributes are quite good.\u201d Shi Feng displayed the attributes.[Recruit\u2019s Warboots] (Bronze Rank, Plate Armor)Level 1Equipment Requirement: Strength 6Defense +8Strength +1, Endurance +1Movement Speed +1Durability 20/20\u201cThis is too great. With this equipment, Brother Feng\u2019s speed would become even faster,\u201d Blackie happily said. Before, it was only him who obtained a Bronze Equipment. It had troubled him to no end. Now that Shi Feng had one as well, his heart became relieved as he said, \u201cBrother Feng, how many Meteorite Ore are we still missing?\u201d\u201cNot many. Just 4 more pieces. We\u2019ll be okay after another wave.\u201d Shi Feng looked into his bag. Unknowingly, there were already 96 pieces of Meteorite Ores in his bag. If someone else had come here to grind, they might have needed five to six hours to obtain this many. Luckily, there was Blackie. They had gathered most of it after just killing a few hundred Kobolds.Just when Shi Feng was about to lure more monsters, his keen senses detected three blurry figures were closing in from behind Blackie.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBlackie, dodge quickly!\u201dShi Feng yelled as he pulled out his Novice Sword. With lightning speed, Shi Feng rushed over.Blackie remained ignorant of the situation. He was still stuck being happy, unaware of the things approaching him.\u201cOnly finding out now? You\u2019re too late. He\u2019ll be the first one.\u201dThree figures suddenly appeared. They were three Assassin players, and one of them was Quiet Wolf, the person who was killed before. A mage being simultaneously ambushed by three Assassins would die, without question. There would be no suspense to it, even if Blackie was 1 level higher than them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even though he wore several pieces of Common Cloth Armor, he had still lost nearly half of his HP.System: Guild [Shadow] has attacked your party. All party members are allowed to attack members of Guild [Shadow] without penalty. Duration of 1 hour.\u201cI\u2019ll fight you guys.\u201dBlackie knew he was sure to die. His speed was not comparable with an Assassin\u2019s. However, he also wanted to retaliate before he died. Blackie started chanting a curse, firing a Dark Arrow towards Quiet Wolf at zero distance.Quiet Wolf smiled in disdain. Although the arrow was unavoidable, he still had 80 HP at Level 0. How strong could a Cursemancer\u2019s attack be? Could it possibly instant-kill him?Hong! The Dark Arrow hit Quiet Wolf.A damage of 76 points appeared above Quiet Wolf\u2019s head, instantly leaving him with only some leftover HP.Quiet Wolf immediately became dumbfounded after seeing such damage; his eyes nearly popping out of their sockets. The other two Assassins were equally shocked.How is this even a Cursemancer?! This was just a cannon!The person who dealt the damage was also shocked. Blackie had never imagined that the Level 3 Dark Arrow would be so powerful.In reality, however, it wasn\u2019t just the Level 3 Dark Arrows taking effect. There was also the high damage Blackwood Staff, the aura effect of Might Of A Thousand, and the bonus damage from level suppression. Such extreme damage was only possible with all these added together.\u201cCrap Let\u2019s kill him, brothers. His Staff is definitely a Mysterious-Iron Equipment,\u201d as a veteran gamer, Quiet Wolf quickly reacted, revealing his greed towards Blackie\u2019s weapon. Blackie being able to deal such a high damage was definitely due to a Mysterious-Iron Weapon. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to nearly instant-kill Quiet Wolf.Suddenly, the other two Assassins became full of energy as they rushed towards Blackie. Not to mention a Mysterious-Iron Weapon, they didn\u2019t even have a Common Weapon. If they could get Blackie\u2019s Mysterious-Iron Weapon, then they would profit beautifully.The three Assassins attacked again, leaving Blackie with only 6 HP remaining. When they saw that Blackie was about to die, the three Assassins became even more excited; the Mysterious-Iron Weapon was about to come into their hands.At this moment, with unbelievable movement methods, Shi Feng appeared in front, blocking Blackie. Three sword strikes blocked the attacks from the three Assassins, creating three sparks. All three Assassins were sent flying backward.Before the Assassins could get over their shock, streaks of thunder appeared within their vision.Three streaks of thunder struck the Assassins that were still floating in midair.Damages of -32, -41, -50appeared on all three of their heads, all of their HP dropping to 0. Their bodies turned into starlight and disappeared within an instant.Because Assassins had low Defense and were under level suppression, the effect of a Level 2 Thundering Flash was extremely horrifying!\u201cBrother Feng\u2026\u2026\u201d Blackie became dumbfounded as he looked at Shi Feng\u2019s back, dumbly saying, \u201cAre you Brother Feng?\u201dEverything had happened all too quickly. Shi Feng had suddenly appeared and swung his sword three times, blocking three attacks from different directions. Then, he had followed it up with a Thundering Flash. All of these actions had been carried out within an instant. It was so fast that the Assassins could not even react.Shi Feng\u2019s actions and reactions were just inhuman. If Blackie wasn\u2019t familiar with the Shi Feng in front of him, he might have even thought it was someone else pretending to be Shi Feng.After sweeping his gaze around, Shi Feng discovered eight players surrounding them. Leading these players was Flaming Tiger. Shi Feng no longer dared to stay behind, hurriedly saying, \u201cWhy are you still in a daze? Let\u2019s go.\u201dShi Feng had activated Fast And Nimble, completely releasing his body\u2019s degree of freedom. However, even though he had a constitution that could keep up and react to his thoughts, his actual body\u2019s Attributes were too low. He had a very hard time controlling his body, and it was also mentally taxing. Taking explosive maneuvers two to three times was still possible, but doing it long-term was definitely too much. The enemies also consisted of numerous healers and Jobs that equipped plate armor. Shi Feng and Blackie\u2019s only choice, now, was to run away.Blackie continuously nodded his head.\u201cEveryone go at them. You must definitely get me my Bronze Equipment and take over this mine.\u201d Flaming Tiger licked the corner of his lips. He was extremely excited. He did not mind the death of the three Assassins at all.Originally, Flaming Tiger was still burning with rage. They had spent hours at Dark Moon Valley searching for Shi Feng and his partner, causing their leveling speed to fall greatly. However, they had accidentally discovered Shi Feng and Blackie grinding monsters.At first, Flaming Tiger had wanted to immediately surround and kill the two. However, when he saw Blackie utilizing the smoke cloud at the cave\u2019s entrance to kill the Level 4 Kobolds, Flaming Tiger nearly died from excitement. His hatred towards Shi Feng had also reduced by a large half. He had even wanted to thank Shi Feng for giving him such a valuable location.The difficulty of killing monsters of a higher level was famously known. If he could kill Level 4 monsters without any harm, then his leveling speed would be absolutely horrifying. It won\u2019t be more than ten hours before he would be leading the other players. After he had gained a huge advantage over others, the task of uniting Red Leaf Town would be at his fingertips. When that time came, he might even become Shadow Workshop\u2019s Captain.Countless virtual game companies had closed shop because of God\u2019s Domain\u2019s opening. There were billions of players joining God\u2019s Domain. To obtain their share in this, many enterprises and financial groups started investing in God\u2019s Domain, one after the other. God\u2019s Domain could be said to be the most profitable virtual game in the world.Flaming Tiger thought about how he would be able to stand out in Red Leaf Town. He thought about forcefully taking the large Guilds down a peg. He also thought about becoming Shadow\u2019s Captain. When that time came, obtaining expensive cars, beautiful ladies, and luxury mansions were only a matter of time. When Flaming Tiger thought of these things, he became unspeakably excited.He had to appreciate Shi Feng for giving all of these things to him.However, appreciation remained just appreciation. He still couldn\u2019t let the Bronze Equipment on Shi Feng and Blackie go.\u201cBrother Tiger, those two are too fast. We can\u2019t catch up to them.\u201d A Berserker said.\u201cThey\u2019re lucky that they run fast. However, this precious piece of land is enough.\u201d Flaming Tiger\u2019s eyes shone when he looked at the mine. He had already fantasized himself leading Red Leaf Town with flair.\u201cBrother Tiger, what about Quiet Wolf and the other two? The three of them fell back to Level 0. They also lost quite a lot of Skill Proficiency,\u201d an Elementalist asked.Flaming Tiger rolled his eyes at his subordinate, asking, \u201cIs this even a problem? You saw as well just now. The Kobolds within the smoke cloud won\u2019t attack players if they\u2019re attacked from a distance. Those are Level 4 monsters. Leveling will be easy, so hurry them over here.\u201d\u201cBrother Tiger is still the smart one. Being able to find such a precious spot, Brother Tiger will definitely become the number one person in Shadow,\u201d the Elementalist started bootlicking Flaming Tiger.\u201cScram! Number one person in Shadow? I am the number one person in God\u2019s Domain!\u201d Flaming Tiger angrily responded.The other members of Shadow also agreed, one after another, laughing at the Elementalist for licking on the wrong boot.A moment later, three mage players started attacking from a distance. As for the other players, they lured the monsters into the smoke cloud. Under Flaming Tiger\u2019s command, they started killing the Kobolds in an orderly manner.\u201cGreat, this is just great! Even after sharing a Kobold\u2019s EXP with so many people, my experience still increased by 2%.\u201d\u201cBrother Tiger, this is really fantastic! These monsters also drop ore and a lot of money. Not only that, but these Kobolds also respawn quickly. We can grind here without limits until we reach Level 6. By that time, we Shadow will definitely become Red Leaf Town\u2019s number one Guild.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe members of Shadow started laughing happily. It wouldn\u2019t take many hours before every one of them reached Level 6. It was already great just imagining how they would suppress the other Guilds in Red Leaf Town.\u201cHahaha! Consider yourselves lucky for following me. The other team leaders are nothing. When the time comes, I\u2019ll become Shadow\u2019s Captain.\u201d Flaming Tiger was in a great mood. With such an increase in experience, it wouldn\u2019t take an hour before he rose to Level 2, compensating for his previous losses.Meanwhile, at the nearby location of Crimson Star Mine, Blackie was grinding his teeth in anger.\u201cBrother Feng, are we just going to let this go? That was hard-to-obtain information that came from a Beta Tester, but now it\u2019s just profiting these people. I get angry just from thinking about it. These people from Shadow are just shameless. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t join them.\u201dShi Feng shook his head as he looked at the System Panel\u2019s clock, smiling indifferently, \u201cThey dare to steal my things. We\u2019ll let them enjoy it for now. In a moment, we\u2019ll let them know after happiness comes sorrow.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15 \u2013 After Happiness, Comes SorrowTime passed, bit by bit.Shi Feng and Blackie did not just do nothing. They were killing Level 4 Roaming Gnomes in a place not far from Crimson Star Mine.[Roaming Gnome] (Common)Level 4HP 400Compared to the Kobolds, the Roaming Gnomes were much agiler. They were very good at dodging. However, their Attack and Defense weren\u2019t all that good.Moreover, Dark Moon Valley had yet to be developed. The monsters here were more numerous, and there was nobody here to compete with; there was no need to search for monsters to kill.Shi Feng was already a Level 3 Swordsman, while Blackie was a Level 2 Cursemancer. After activating Fast And Nimble, the Roaming Gnome\u2019s dagger had no chance of even touching Shi Feng. As for Blackie, his damage was even fiercer after drinking a Black Steel Beer. With Shi Feng entangling the gnomes in the front, and Blackie dealing damage from behind, killing off the Roaming Gnomes became very easy. The efficiency was even better than grinding off the Kobolds.In the front of the Crimson Star Mine, groups of Kobolds laid still before the mine\u2019s entrance. Copper Coins and various kinds of ores were scattered all over the ground.\u201cBrother Tiger, this place is just too great. It\u2019s just been over half an hour, and everyone is already Level 2. So much money dropped, as well.\u201d\u201cHahaha, keep up the effort everyone. You three, lure more monsters. As long as we continue grinding this way, it will only be three to four hours before we can rise to Level 3.\u201dFlaming Tiger excitedly commanded the three Assassins that just recently arrived to lure the Kobolds. The mages were already Level 2, so the speed of killing the Kobolds had increased by a big leap. Luring a group of over thirty Kobolds was not enough for them.\u201cBrother Tiger, something dropped here.\u201d A Berserker held on to a book as he shouted.\u201cBring it here, let me have a look at it.\u201d Flaming Tiger said while smiling. He licked his dried lips when he saw something dropped.After Flaming Tiger received the book, he suddenly started laughing loudly.\u201cGreat, really great! Not only has the spot that kid found after much effort been taken over by me, but if he knew a rare skill for Swordsman was even in my hands? I really want to see that kid\u2019s look of regret.\u201d\u201cBrother Tiger, I saw that kid when I came here. They were still nearby killing Roaming Gnomes. I\u2019m guessing that they\u2019re still unwilling to leave and still thinking of this place. Why don\u2019t we go over and kill them? Save us some trouble.\u201d A cold glint flashed through Quiet Wolf\u2019s eyes. They were filled with killing intent. He was overcome by a great resentment after being killed twice by Shi Feng.Flaming Tiger waved his hand; with a disdainful smile on his face as he said, \u201cThen let them look. Watch at how fast we level up and earn money, and at how we become the tyrants of Red Leaf Town. Meanwhile, they can only watch from a side with their hearts full of regret and unwillingness. Hahaha, I feel great just thinking about it.\u201dAlthough Quiet Wolf still held some resentment over it, when he imagined Shi Feng\u2019s unwilling appearance and how he could only exhaust himself killing Roaming Gnomes Quiet Wolf\u2019s heart felt a great gust of pleasure.\u201cJust you wait. The moment I reach Level 6 will be your death.\u201d Quiet Wolf did not actually give up on killing Shi Feng. Instead, when he thought about the pleasure he would feel after killing Shi Feng when he was Level 6, he couldn\u2019t help but look forward to it.Meanwhile, in the forest 60 yards South of the Crimson Star Mine, Shi Feng was using a tree to hide while he observed Flaming Tiger and the others.\u201cBrother Feng, can the two of us handle it?\u201d Blackie asked in a worried tone.These 11 people were not just any average players. They were experts that had passed Shadow Workshop\u2019s examination. Moreover, there were two healers on their side. It was impossible to kill all of these people just by depending on the two of them.\u201cRelax. The time is almost up. We\u2019ll just watch the show.\u201d Shi Feng looked at the time, indifferently saying, \u201cIn a moment, you go stand at the back. Kill whoever has low HP; don\u2019t let even one of them get away.\u201d\u201cTime is almost up?\u201d Blackie didn\u2019t understand what it meant.Shi Feng pointed towards the smoke cloud in front of the Crimson Star Mine\u2019s entrance, saying with a smile, \u201cThat Flaming Tiger must think that killing monsters of a higher level is easy. The Smoke Bomb that we placed before we left has a time limit, and only two minutes are left before the hour is up. Did they think they could continuously enjoy my domain after stealing it from me? Now, I\u2019ll teach them how to be proper human beings.\u201dBlackie was struck with a realization. His worship towards Shi Feng became even greater now.\u201cBrother Feng is still the smartest. Those brats from Shadow are definitely goners this time.\u201d Blackie said with a grin.The reason they could cross levels and harmlessly kill Kobolds was that of the Smoke Bombs. They definitely couldn\u2019t do without them. If there were no Smoke Bomb, then the consequences would be horrifying.Two minutes later, the smoke cloud in front of the Crimson Star Mine slowly dispersed.\u201cBrother Tiger, why is that smoke cloud disappearing?\u201d an Elementalist asked Flaming Tiger after noticing the disappearing smoke cloud.\u201cThe smoke cloud disappeared? It can\u2019t be.\u201d Flaming Tiger abruptly woke up from his nap. When he looked over at the mine\u2019s entrance, the smoke cloud really did disappear. \u201cIf it\u2019s gone, then fine. The smoke cloud might be a periodic thing. Don\u2019t bother with it; keep on grinding.\u201dJust as Flaming Tiger finished speaking, the usually stupid-looking Kobolds that did not retaliate suddenly looked towards the members of Shadow Workshop in unison.There were over forty Kobolds with blood red eyes. The Kobolds let out angry growls after finally discovering the people who had been attacking them. Suddenly, they all came rushing forth.The members of Shadow did not react at all. Within an instant, they were surrounded and given a beating by the Kobolds. A Level 2 player could hardly take 3 hits from a Kobold, not to mention a group of Kobolds.Seven players died within a blink of an eye. The backline players became a mess as they ran for their lives.However, the Kobolds were very fast. It only took them moments to catch up to the escaping mages. For each mage, they were gifted a hammer to their heads. The mages quickly lie still on the floor, never to rise up again.\u201cCrap, what is going on here? Why did these Kobolds suddenly become insane?\u201d Flaming Tiger cursed. He quickly turned tail and ran the moment he noticed the situation turned bad.They had risen to Level 2 after much effort. However, this death sent them all back to Level 1. There were even three Assassins who were Level 0. It was an absolute loss. With such an increase and decrease, the dream becoming the tyrants of Red Leaf Town also perished. Instead, the current members of Shadow weren\u2019t even up to par with the average player. They were even further away from the other Guilds.Flaming Tiger\u2019s heart started to bleed in pain.\u201cWe meet again, \u2018Brother Tycoon,\u2019\u201d Shi Feng said with an indifferent smile. He currently blocked Flaming Tiger\u2019s escape path.After seeing Shi Feng\u2019s sneer, even an idiot would understand that the Kobolds\u2019 rebellion had something to do with him.\u201cYou\u2019re dead for sure, kid. You dare to actually scheme against me. If I don\u2019t kill you back to Level 0, then my name will be read backward.\u201d All of Flaming Tiger\u2019s hair stood up in anger. He raised his shield and swung it at Shi Feng.Compared to the other members of Shadow Workshop, Flaming Tiger\u2019s skills were clearly a tier higher.With one hand, he used his shield to block Shi Feng\u2019s vision, while he used the other to stab his short sword towards Shi Feng\u2019s vital point. It was simple, yet sinister, and it was very hard to stop.However, Flaming Tiger\u2019s confident strike struck air.\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Flaming Tiger fixed his gaze to the front. However, there wasn\u2019t even a shadow of a person present.\u201cOver here.\u201d Shi Feng stood behind Flaming Tiger, his sword waving down.Chop!A damage of -36 appeared above Flaming Tiger\u2019s head. His HP had instantly gone from 220 to 184.When Flaming Tiger was hit, he hurriedly spun around and used [Shield Bash].However, Shi Feng had long since seen through Flaming Tiger\u2019s movements. He took a step backward and spun his body around, hiding by the shield. Then, Shi Feng arrived once more at Flaming Tiger\u2019s back, giving him another sword slash.Without the use of any Skills, Shi Feng could only deal 23 damage to a Shield Warrior with high defense.\u201cYou coward! Don\u2019t hide if you have the ability. I can kill you anytime I want!\u201d Flaming Tiger could not land any hits on the agile Shi Feng. His HP was constantly decreasing, and only 83 points of it remained now. He had no way of dealing with Shi Feng\u2019s attacks, so he decided to start ridiculing Shi Feng in hopes of provoking him, allowing Flaming Tiger the chance to kill Shi Feng.\u201cSure, I\u2019ll stand here without dodging. Come attack me then.\u201d Shi Feng answered without hesitation.Flaming Tiger silently smiled. He never imagined that Shi Feng was such a fool, taking the bait with just a small amount of stimulation.\u201cWatch how I\u2019ll toy with you to death.\u201d Flaming Tiger raised his shield and used [Charge] at Shi Feng. If Shi Feng didn\u2019t dodge, then he could only take the hit forcefully. In terms of Strength, Flaming Tiger wouldn\u2019t lose to Shi Feng.However, only disappointment was waiting for him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJust when Flaming Tiger was 2 yards away from Shi Feng, Shi Feng immediately used Thundering Flash.Three streaks of thunder went past Flaming Tiger\u2019s shield, directly landing on his body. Three high damages appeared above Flaming Tiger\u2019s head, -28, -35, -41, his HP instantly dropping to 0.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 Despicable!\u201d Flaming Tiger glared at Shi Feng. He was furious to the point of spitting out blood. If it weren\u2019t for himself rushing towards Shi Feng on his own accord, he wouldn\u2019t have been struck by all the attacks of that skill.\u201cAre you alright, Brother Tycoon? I said I would stand here without dodging, but I\u2019ve never said I wouldn\u2019t move my hands. How could you be so gullible, even rushing over, yourself?\u201d Shi Feng spread out his arms, showing that it was all a mistake, saying, \u201cOh, right. I still have to thank Brother Tycoon for earning me so many ores. You\u2019ve saved me a lot of time.\u201dFlaming Tiger pointed towards Shi Feng, wanting to say something. However, his body had already turned into starlight and disappeared. He couldn\u2019t even utter a single word, only leaving behind a pile of ore and a single book.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Following which, figures of players appeared, one by one. These players were the revived members of Shadow.These people had down and extremely depressed expressions on their faces.Nothing could beat the pain and entangled feeling of having recently gained something, then losing it again.Just a moment ago, they were still dreaming of becoming the tyrants of Red Leaf Town. Their levels were increasing; it was like flying. In the next second, however, they died. Not only had their levels and Skill Proficiency decreased, but the experience they had at Level 1 was also lower than before. They were much worse off compared to the average player.Flaming Tiger\u2019s expression after reviving was even more livid. His eyes alone could eat a person alive.System: Player Ye Feng has killed you. You will be revived in Red Leaf Town after 3 seconds. At the same time, you will lose 1 Level, and all your Skill Proficiencies will be reduced by 100 points.\u201cYe Feng! I will not let you off! I will definitely make you wish for death!\u201d Flaming Tiger let out an angry bellow after looking at the numbers displayed by the System. His actions had caused the other players to quickly avoid him, not daring to look at this madman.After venting for a while, Flaming Tiger ordered the other members of Shadow to check their bags, checking for the items they dropped.Although this death caused great losses for everyone, there wasn\u2019t just the EXP gained from killing Kobolds. There was also loot; this was also the only thing they could be happy about. At the very least, they did not busy themselves for nothing.When Flaming Tiger took a look into his bag, a sweet taste suddenly entered his throat; he spat out a mouthful of blood.\u201cAt once! Immediately! We head for Dark Moon Valley, now! I must kill that kid!\u201d Flaming Tiger\u2019s bellowed, his anger reaching up to the skies.The skill book that he planned on using to ridicule Shi Feng was gone. It was an extremely rare skill for Swordsman, and it was also the most valuable item they got from grinding Kobolds. Now, it was gone.However, the most unforgivable thing was that the skill book had fallen into Shi Feng\u2019s hands. In the end, all of Flaming Tiger\u2019s efforts had become Shi Feng\u2019s gains. This was something that he would not tolerate. His hatred was something that could not be resolved, even if he were to kill Shi Feng back to Level 0.The other members of Shadow did not understand what had happened to Flaming Tiger. Going to search for Shi Feng right now was just a futile effort. Nobody would be foolish enough to wait for them to take revenge. Shi Feng would definitely slip away, snickering at them in some other place.At this moment, Flaming Tiger\u2019s System Communication rang.\u201cWho is it! Disturbing me at this time, are you trying to die?\u201d Flaming Tiger cursed after the call connected.\u201cFlaming Tiger, your temper sure has grown after not meeting for a day.\u201d The voice on the other side was ice cold, as if in a furious rage.Flaming Tiger felt the familiarity of that voice. When he found the corresponding identity to the voice, his face suddenly turned extremely ugly, \u201cBrother Zhang, it is you. I\u2019m currently educating my subordinates. I never thought Brother Zhang would contact me. Brother Zhang, please don\u2019t mind it. I wasn\u2019t speaking about you just now.\u201d\u201cEnough. I already know about your problem. Just looking at the damage you\u2019ve caused towards Shadow\u2019s development in Red Leaf Town,Looking at what the good you\u2019ve done has accomplished towards Shadow\u2019s development in Red Leaf Town, I\u2019ll come to you immediately. From now onwards, you don\u2019t have to continue being Red Leaf Town\u2019s Team Leader. Silent Rain, the team\u2019s Elementalist will take over temporarily. If, you\u2019re still not Level 2 by the time I arrive in Red Leaf Town, then you can just get lost. Shadow doesn\u2019t need garbage.\u201dFlaming Tiger became spiritless after hearing these words. His hatred for Shi Feng would never be washed away, even by the five lakes and four seas.Meanwhile, in Dark Moon Valley, Shi Feng and Blackie were picking up the drops from the members of Shadow.Shi Feng was currently holding the skill book dropped by Flaming Tiger.\u201cFlaming Tiger really is too generous. He had even left me such an item.\u201d Shi Feng chose to learn the skill without hesitation.[Wind Blade] (Action-type)Requires: SwordLevel 1Proficiency 0/300Ambush an enemy outside 5 yards and within 30 yards. Movement Speed will be increased by 40% when rushing towards the target and Attack Speed increased by 20% for 3 seconds.Cooldown: 25 secondsA Swordsman mobility would be greatly increased with this skill. It was a great counter to Rangers and mages who love to kite.\u201cBrother Feng, the Meteorite Ore we need are all here. There are also quite a few Bronze Ore. Shadow really helped us big this time.\u201d Blackie laughed loudly. As he was collecting the ore from the ground, he noticed a piece of dark green ore. Picking it up, he asked, \u201cBrother Feng, what is this [Star Crystal]?\u201dWhen Shi Feng heard about the Star Crystal, he ignored the Meteorite Ore below his feet, instantly turning around and running towards Blackie.\u201cDamn, it really is a Star Crystal! Blackie, your luck is really too good. You even picked up such a thing.\u201d Shi Feng said excitedly as he carefully looked at the dark green ore after receiving it.Every monster in the world had a chance of dropping a Star Crystal. The chances were a million to one. Maybe it was trash to other people, but to Shi Feng, it was a priceless treasure. It was also the thing he needed the most.\u201cBrother Feng, what is this Star Crystal for?\u201d Blackie curiously asked. Shi Feng was usually calm and indifferent. Such an excited reaction from him displayed the preciousness of the Star Crystal.\u201cIt\u2019s for eating, but not for players.\u201d Shi Feng smiled slightly but did not continue explaining as he kept the Star Crystal.\u201cIt\u2019s for eating?\u201d Blackie was slightly confused. Who would eat a rock? However, Shi Feng must have his own reasons for not explaining, so Blackie did not continue asking about it.A moment later, all the drops were collected. They had received a total of 14 pieces of Meteorite Ore, and 32 pieces of Bronze Ore. Not only had they completed Shi Feng\u2019s Quest, they even had some leftovers.Subsequently, the two of them arrived at the smithy.\u201cMaster Jack, I have collected the Meteorite Ore you asked for.\u201d Shi Feng handed over all of the Meteorite Ore, not leaving even one behind. These were all Quest Items. A stack of them would only sell for 1 Copper to an NPC. It was utterly worthless.\u201cNot bad, young man. However, if you wish to become an outstanding Forger, you still need to have enough strength to obtain precious ore. There is a powerful Kobold Chieftain. Go kill it to prove your strength.\u201d Master Jack said eloquently as he stored away the Meteorite Ore.System: Hidden Quest \u2018Road Of Forging\u2019. Kill the Kobold Chieftain inside Crimson Star Mine. Time limit of 1 hour.When Shi Feng saw that there was still a second stage to the Quest, Shi Feng wished he could curse Hammer Trading. He had caused Shi Feng big trouble this time.As expected, everybody would have kept something to themselves. Nobody could be trusted. Everyone\u2019s a liar.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, Hammer Trading had not mentioned a second stage of the Quest. Now a second stage, time-limited Quest had appeared. It was even against a Chieftain monster. That wasn\u2019t an Elite monster you simply run across. A Chieftain was even stronger than a Special Elite. It was the equivalent of a Dungeon\u2019s Boss. Shi Feng was just Level 3, and a Leader monster was just too deadly to him.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, Hammer Trading was Level 16 when he accepted the Quest. Completing the Quest was extremely easy.\u201cForget it; let\u2019s have a look at it first.\u201d He could do nothing about being tricked. However, Shi Feng did not plan to give up. The Forging Talent had too great of a use, and Shi Feng must learn it.Following which, Shi Feng and Blackie cleared the way of Kobolds as they headed towards the deeper parts of the Crimson Star Mine.Compared to the Kobolds at the entrance, the Kobolds inside were no longer Level 4; they were Level 5. They took more time and energy to kill. Often, another Kobold would respawn before one was killed. If there weren\u2019t enough Black Steel Beer to reduce the Kobold\u2019s level by 2, then Shi Feng and Blackie\u2019s killing speed would be completely unable to keep up with the respawn rate.Half an hour later, Shi Feng and Blackie arrived at the deepest part of the Crimson Star Mine.It was a large piece of empty land. There were over ten Kobolds mining for ore in the surroundings. There was a huge figure standing in the center of the empty area. It was a Kobold that wore armor, and it was constantly giving out commands to the other Kobolds.[Kobold Chieftain] (Chieftain-rank)Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLevel 5HP 2100/2100Just its HP alone could cause a person despair, not to mention the heavy armor worn on the Kobold Chieftain; its Defense was definitely high. It was nearly impossible for physical-type attacks to cause a lot of damage. Moreover, Chieftain Rank monsters had a recovery speed of 2% HP every 5 seconds when in battle. That meant the Kobold Chieftain would recover 42 HP every 5 seconds. It was not a number to look down upon. An average Level 5 player with physical-type damage might not even be able to deal 42 damage within 5 seconds.As for using the Smoke bombs to kill the Kobold Chieftain safely, that was completely impossible. A Chieftain monster\u2019s range of vision was extremely wide. Even a Kobold would have a vision range of 55 yards. Using the Smoke Bomb to reduce its vision by 10 yards would still leave it with 45 yards. Even for Rangers, who had the furthest firing range of 40 yards, it was not enough.Shi Feng thought through it again and again as he looked at the Kobold Chieftain before him, helplessly laughing, \u201cDo I really have to use that?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ignoring its horrifying amount of HP, the giant ax on its back was enough to terrify someone. If Blackie were hit with that ax, he would definitely turn into meat paste within an instant.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Shi Feng shook his head. Plans can never keep up with change. There was not a single terrain within the mine that could be used. They could only fight the Kobold Chieftain head on if they wanted to kill it.The Kobold Chieftain was the most powerful monster Shi Feng had met up with to this point.If he had enough time, Shi Feng would come here when he was Level 5, with a full body of Bronze Equipment. He would have an eighty percent chance by then. However, there was little left of the time that Forging Master Jack gave him. If he wanted to finish the battle within the twenty minutes remaining, then he would need to send out a small party of Level 5 Elites to do so.However, there were only two of them. Their equipment was also poor. Trying to kill the Kobold Chieftain within twenty minutes was utterly impossible.However, there would be dire consequences if the Quest was not finished. There was only one chance to do this Hidden Quest. If it failed, Shi Feng would not be able to receive it ever again.Thus, Shi Feng was even more unwilling to give up this Quest.\u201cI can only try it.\u201d Shi Feng unwillingly took out the Magic Weapon, Abyssal Blade.In his previous life, the number of Magic Weapons Shi Feng had personally witnessed could be counted on his fingers. Anybody who had seen a Magic Weapon\u2019s power would be brought to submission by it. Whereas, those who could properly wield a Magic Weapon was as rare as a phoenix\u2019s feather.Crimson War God was one such person. He had grown to fame within a Guild War that had involved over 100,000 people. During that war, Crimson War God held a bloodied Magic Weapon, the Crimson Ghost Ax. He rushed into groups of thousands of warriors with the ax and slaughtered. There was no one who could block his giant ax. In the end, the enemy Guild was forced to retreat in embarrassment. Crimson War God had created the scene of one man defending against 10,000. After that war, he built up the glorious War God Empire.There was also the \u2018Madman\u2019, Windchaser. He held the Magic Weapon, Evil Spirit\u2019s Roar. With only the bow in hand, Windchaser had single-handedly defended a city. Of the thousands of enemy players, not one of them could enter within 100 yards of the city. Using a single arrow, Windchaser had even sniped Outstandingly Extraordinary, the Guild Leader of [Imposing Expert]. Outstandingly Extraordinary had been standing further than 100 yards from the city at that time.As long as they were a Magic Weapon user, then they would be famous, top-tier experts in God\u2019s Domain that were respected by all.System: Do you wish to bind the Abyssal Blade?Shi Feng sucked in a deep breath, choosing to bind. He did not care anymore about the Backlash of the Magic Weapon. Since those people could control the Magic Weapons, then how could he, as a reincarnated person, lose to those \u2018newbies\u2019 that had yet to grow up?The moment the binding was finished, Shi Feng could clearly feel his entire body\u2019s strength being sapped away. His levels, as well, dropped one after the other, becoming Level 0 within an instant. In another moment, however, a force of strength started flowing through his body. His body\u2019s current constitution was even stronger than when he was Level 3.When he checked the Abyssal Blade\u2019 Attributes, Shi Feng became even more shocked.[Abyssal Blade] (Magic Weapon, One-handed Sword)Attack Power 24All Attributes +10Attack Speed +3Ignore monster\u2019s Level by 5.

Duration of 20 seconds.Cooldown: 5 minutes.The Abyssal Blade was personally created by Master Smith Olysses, using the Black Dragon King\u2019s fangs as material. It is one of thirty-six famed swords, and it is ranked 31st. However, this sword has been cursed by the Black Dragon King. Aside from being able to provide the wielder with immense strength, there would be a Backlash after a certain period of time. If the wielder is unable to suppress the Backlash, the wielder will receive the curse of the Black Dragon King, permanently reducing All Attributes by 50%.Unable to be dropped.Unable to be traded.Seeing such Attributes and these many Additional Skills, the Abyssal Blade was no different than a God\u2019s Weapon. However, there were still thirty-five of these Famed Swords, and the Abyssal Blade was just one of the lower ranked ones. It was hard to imagine what kind of sword the first ranked was.\u201cBrother Feng, please don\u2019t scare me. How did you become Level 0?\u201d Glancing at Shi Feng from the side, Blackie became shocked. It had already been troublesome just facing the Kobold Chieftain. Now that Shi Feng had fallen back to Level 0, how could they fight it?\u201cRelax. Use the Smoke Bombs to clear off the small mobs first. Leave the Kobold Chieftain to me.\u201d Shi Feng called up the Attribute Panel, placing all 6 Free Attribute Points into Agility. His Agility had reached 20 points exactly, activating [Fast And Nimble]. Shi Feng was very eager to test his sword on the Kobold Chieftain.Character: Ye Feng (Human)Affiliated Kingdom: Star-MoonTitle: Might Of A ThousandJob: SwordsmanLevel: 0HP: 460/460Attack Power: 72Defense: 4Attack Speed: 10Movement Speed: 8Attributes: Strength 24, Agility 20, Endurance 22, Intelligence 13, Vitality 13System: Strength has reached 20 points.

Activating Hidden Basic Skill, [Robust Physique].Along with the activation of the Hidden Basic Skills for Strength and Endurance, Shi Feng could now utilize the full potential of his current body. He was no longer a three-second hero.Although he was Level 0, his current Attack Power and Attributes were far above that of when he was Level 3. His HP was even more awesome. It wasn\u2019t any worse than a Level 5 Shield Warrior\u2019s HP. Not to mention Shi Feng still had a bunch of high-level Skills. He could definitely fight it out with the Kobold Chieftain.While Shi Feng was getting used to his body, Blackie had cleared all of the Kobolds in the surrounding areas, leaving behind only the Kobold Chieftain.\u201cWait for me to pull aggro, then you can start madly attacking.\u201d Shi Feng instructed. Taking a step forward, Shi Feng rushed towards the Kobold Chieftain.Wind Blade!In the blink of an eye, Shi Feng had arrived in front of the Kobold Chieftain. The Kobold Chieftain had yet to react before two streaks of black light slashed at its neck. Suddenly, blood splashed from its neck, causing the Kobold Chieftain to scream in pain. Two frightening damages appeared above its head.-63, -128\u2026The Kobold Chieftain finally reacted. However, just as it lifted its giant ax, another sword flash passed through an unprotected area of its body.Chop!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnother -105 damage appeared on the Kobold Chieftain. The power of a Level 4 Chop was shocking.When the giant ax landed on the ground, it created a large crater. However, Shi Feng had long since retreated and followed up by using a Level 4 Thundering Flash.Three streaks of violent thunder passed through the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s gigantic body, creating damages of -84, -101, -123.Shi Feng had taken over 600 HP away from the Kobold Chieftain after just a single exchange. The might of the Famed Sword, the Abyssal Blade even shocked Shi Feng himself.Blackie, who stood a distance away, was even more dumbfounded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The blood that leaked from its wound became its stimulant.The Kobold Chieftain raised its giant ax, bombarding Shi Feng with one attack after another.The Kobold Chieftain could not react appropriately towards Shi Feng\u2019s previous surprise attack. It could only instinctively attack, so its attacks were aggressive.Against the wild attacks of the Kobold Chieftain, even a Level 5 Shield Warrior or Guardian Knight would die within an instant.Shi Feng could only retreat under such intense attacks. He did not have any chance to retaliate. He also needed to dodge the incoming rubble the size of fists. If they hit him, it would cause quite an amount of damage.A man and a beast exchanged moves at high speeds. If it were an average man, he most likely would not be able to make a single move. He would be halved by the giant ax, becoming very much dead.\u201cBlackie, hurry and attack it. I can\u2019t hold on for much longer.\u201dShi Feng had been dodging for a whole seven or eight seconds now. When he saw Blackie, having yet to attack, he shouted loudly.They were currently facing a Chieftain Boss, not a little Elite. The attack patterns of a Chieftain Boss were not as monotonous as an Elite\u2019s; it had a variety of attacks. The Chieftain Boss was a monster that possessed intelligence. It would even change its attack pattern for specific players. Couple that with a strength that was two to three times that of a normal Elite, the Chieftain Boss was stronger than an Elite by at least four times.Although Shi Feng had only exchanged blows with the Kobold Chieftain for seven or eight seconds, it felt like several minutes had gone by. Just from blocking attacks and the occasional counter attack had already taken over 100 HP from Shi Feng. If this situation continued, it wouldn\u2019t be long before his HP reached 0.With the Famed Sword, Abyssal Blade, Shi Feng\u2019s Attributes were greatly increased. It allowed three Hidden Basic Skills that were most important to a melee player to be activated. With these Skills, Shi Feng was able to exhibit extraordinary attacks and dodges continuously. If he did not possess the Abyssal Blade, Shi Feng would have died long ago.\u201cAh, I\u2019ll come help you, Brother Feng.\u201d Blackie realized his mistake as he finally reacted. He hurriedly waved his staff, his mouth chanting a curse. After aiming at the Kobold Chieftain, he shot a Dark Arrow.The Dark Arrow landed on the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s body, only dealing 17 points of damage.Blackie\u2019s mouth became wide open after seeing this damage. He couldn\u2019t help becoming astonished by a Chieftain monster\u2019s Defense. Blackie could cause over 50 damage if he attacked a Level 5 monster, however, it was only a third of that amount now. It could be seen how shocking a Chieftain monster\u2019s Defense was. On the other hand, Shi Feng could deal over a hundred damage in a hit. What kind of Attack Power was that?Shi Feng abruptly slashed the Abyssal Blade in mid-battle.Chop!A black light dug itself through a gap in the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s attack.Peng! Shi Feng took three steps backward before stabilizing his body, over 30 damage appearing above his head. On the other hand, only the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s giant ax was pushed back, pausing slightly in midair.\u201cIt worked. It seems like my Strength is just barely enough.\u201d Shi Feng was very satisfied with the attack this time.During battles within God\u2019s Domain, not only could players defend and dodge, but they could also interrupt a monster\u2019s attack; this would cause the monster\u2019s attack to stop briefly, ending the monster\u2019s offensive. It was a high-leveled battle technique. Such techniques only started becoming popular half a year after God\u2019s Domain\u2019s opening, especially in Boss battles. If the MT (main tank) did not learn such techniques, the end-result would be a party-wipe. This was because there were no players capable of blocking a Boss\u2019 crazed and continuous attacks.The Kobold Chieftain\u2019s momentary pause had caused it to reveal a weak point.Shi Feng rushed in without hesitation. Gathering all his strength into his hand, Shi Feng gripped the Abyssal Blade tightly and continuously struck the Kobold Chieftain.Four streaks of sword light hit the unarmored parts of the Kobold Chieftain.With the damage amplification effect, Shi Feng\u2019s attack instantly took to 300 HP away from the Kobold Chieftain. Adding in Blackie\u2019s attack, the Kobold Chieftain only had little over 900 HP remaining.\u201cAo! Ao! Ao!\u201d The Kobold Chieftain started going into a frenzy. It threw its giant ax to a side, pulling out two machetes from its waist.The change in weapons caused the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s attack patterns to change.If the Kobold Chieftain was a Berserker when he held the giant ax, then after wielding the pair of blades, the Kobold Chieftain was a dual-wielding Swordsman. The Kobold Chieftain now combined Strength with Agility, no longer just using violence to oppress its opponent.The attack pattern of the pair of blades was no longer monotonous. The Kobold Chieftain\u2019s attack speed had a large increase as well. Just after Shi Feng dodged one of the blades, the other came following behind. Shi Feng hurriedly used the Abyssal Blade to block it.Dazzling sparks were created when the blade and sword intersected with each other. Shi Feng\u2019s entire person was sent flying away.When Shi Feng was still in midair, he saw the Kobold Chieftain leaping with all its might, it\u2019s machete raised high for a frontal assault.\u201cIs it going all out?\u201d Shi Feng was shocked, hurriedly using\u2026Parry!Hong!The Abyssal Blade blocked the machete. However, Shi Feng was like a meteorite as he fell heavily to the ground. Shi Feng had thought the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s attack to be over. However, as it fell from the sky, its twin blades plunged downwards as well, with Shi Feng\u2019s chest as their target.Shi Feng was unable to move to dodge the attack.\u201cPhantom Kill!\u201dInstantly, a doppelganger of Shi Feng appeared 3 yards away from him. With lightning speed, Shi Feng swapped places with his doppelganger.When the Kobold Chieftain landed, both its blades stabbed into the doppelganger\u2019s chest. The doppelganger\u2019s HP madly fell, over 300 HP disappearing within an instant.Just as the Kobold Chieftain revealed an excited smile, Shi Feng appeared behind its back. The Abyssal Blade in his hand was also letting out a faint black glow.Nine Dragons Slash!Nine phantoms of the Abyssal Blade appeared, silently floating in midair and circling Shi Feng.Although Shi Feng could not completely control all nine swords, using the nine of them for a simple attack was not a problem.Shashasha\u2026\u2026Nine Abyssal Blades danced as if they were playful sprites, continuously penetrating the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s body.Small values that were just over -10 continuously appeared on the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s head. Although the damage was very low, the quantity was high. Including Shi Feng\u2019s Chop and normal attacks, the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s HP fell close to 500 HP.Seeing the Kobold Chieftain wanting to turn around, Shi Feng did not dare give it any chance for a counterattack. Immediately, Shi Feng used Abyssal Bind. The Kobold Chieftain could not move for 3 seconds, and its Defense was reduced by 100%.In a battle, where even blinking would get you killed, three seconds was enough to change the results.The Kobold Chieftain could not move after being bound by the pitch-black chains which came from the Abyssal Blade. The nine Abyssal Blades continued attacking without stop, creating damages of over -20 with each hit. The Kobold Chieftain\u2019s HP madly fell, leaving it with only around 200 HP within a moment.\u201cAwoo!\u201d The Kobold Chieftain bellowed as it became thoroughly berserk, its body size becoming two-folds larger.Shi Feng watched as the 3 seconds passed by. The Kobold Chieftain\u2019s strength was no joke after becoming completely berserk. Its strength had increased by at least 30%.However, all of Shi Feng\u2019s attacks and lifesaving skills were still on cooldown.As if having seen through Shi Feng\u2019s distress, the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s face revealed a mocking expression. Two large blades came crashing towards Shi Feng, their speeds like that of flying arrows.At the moment of life and death, Shi Feng noticed a Kobold miner respawning from the corner of his eyes.Immediately, Shi Feng activated Gravity Liberation, followed by Wind Blade.With lightning speed, Shi Feng dodged the chop from the twin blades and rushed towards the Kobold miner\u2019s front.\u201cAo! Ao! Ao!\u201d When the Kobold Chieftain saw the near-death Shi Feng actually dodging its attack, its strong legs abruptly stomped on the ground, pushing it straight towards Shi Feng.Blackie felt chills down his back as he watched Shi Feng fighting. Regardless, his mouth never stopped chanting curses, sending out one Dark Arrow after another. However, the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s speed was too fast, trying to hit it was just too hard. Fortunately, there was more than a 20-yard distance between the Kobold Chieftain and Shi Feng. The Kobold Chieftain would still need some time to catch up to Shi Feng. Within this period, Shi Feng might even be able to kill off the Kobold Chieftain with the nine phantoms of the Abyssal Blade.However, both Shi Feng and Blackie had underestimated the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s explosive strength. Not only were its Strength and Defense greatly increased, even its Agility had a great increase.It only took 2 seconds for the Kobold Chieftain to reach over 20 yards.The Kobold Chieftain lifted its twin blades, strongly slashing it down.The Kobold miner in front of Shi Feng was split into two, and a rain of blood fell 5 yards around it. This slash had closely brushed past Shi Feng\u2019s cheek, nearly taking his life away.Seeing the Kobold Chieftain preparing to slash down its other blade, Shi Feng strongly raised the Abyssal Blade in his hand. Three streaks of thunder penetrated the Kobold Chieftain\u2019s body, taking away its last remaining 130 HP.Seeing the Kobold Chieftain finally fall, Shi Feng let loose a breath of relief.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Chieftain monster is truly too strong. Even if Shi Feng came here at Level 5 fully equipped with Bronze Equipment, he would still be a goner. He could only kill it due to luck. Compared to a Level 2 Thundering Flash, the Level 4 Thundering Flash only had a cooldown of 24 seconds. The cooldown had finished just in time, allowing Shi Feng to escape death.System: Level 5 Kobold Chieftain killed. Level difference of 5. EXP obtained increased by 500%.

Copper Coins paved the floor as well in a copper glow, shining through the entire mine as if celebrating Shi Feng\u2019s success.At the moment, Blackie sat paralyzed on the ground, cold sweat pervading his entire body. It was as if all of his strength was sapped out from his body; he could not care less about the drops on the ground. This battle was truly difficult. There was no time to even take a breath; every minute and every second were a soul-shocking moment that stimulated the eyes.Every moment of the battle just toyed with Blackie\u2019s heart. He would not be able to take it at all if he did not have a strong heart.As for Shi Feng, who could battle against the Kobold Chieftain head-on, what kind of heart did he possess?\u201cThis is too great! We won, Brother Feng! You really are my idol!\u201d Blackie loudly shouted in extreme excitement. Seeing Shi Feng\u2019s calm face, Blackie was filled with respect for him.Although Shi Feng\u2019s former strength was quite good, surpassing many average players, he was still just an average professional player. Shi Feng\u2019s skill had never been out of reach for Blackie. Shi Feng had been previously quick to get excited. He would even get into an endless conflict over a piece of common equipment as if he was an unsheathed blade. However, the current Shi Feng was hugely different than before; it was as if he became a different person. The present Shi Feng was extremely calm and did things without hesitation. He gave off a certain serenity that resembled that of a dormant dragon; he did not do anything outstanding normally; yet when he did, it would shock the world.\u201cBlackie, wasn\u2019t your idol Gentle Snow?\u201d Shi Feng slightly smiled as he said so.\u201cOf course Gentle Snow is my idol. However, you\u2019re awesome as well, Brother Feng! Usually, you keep quiet without revealing anything, but now that you\u2019ve shown it, even such a powerful Kobold Chieftain was done in by you. Not even a true professional gamer could compare to you, so how could I not admire you? As they said, the shade is better under a large tree. Brother Feng, you should teach me how to play a Cursemancer! Even in my dreams, I\u2019ve dreamt of becoming a professional gamer.\u201d In Blackie\u2019s eyes, Shi Feng was just like a mountain of gold. He was glad for the choice he had previously made. If he had gone to Shadow Workshop, he would probably still be a nameless gold-farming member. He wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to meet an expert; forget about becoming a real expert.\u201cAlright.\u201d Shi Feng smiled. Blackie\u2019s character was just so straightforward.When Shi Feng was fired in his previous life, Blackie had resigned as well, without hesitation. Blackie had given up a job with an annual income of millions just to share the suffering together with him. Naturally, Shi Feng wouldn\u2019t betray Blackie; he would teach Blackie whatever he could. Although Shi Feng had not played a Cursemancer before, he had still observed plenty of expert Cursemancers. Shi Feng knew the general direction to develop a Cursemancer, and it was more than enough to give pointers to Blackie.\u201cBrother Feng, how do you think I should place my points early on? Do I go full Intelligence?\u201d Blackie asked.Shi Feng shook his head, saying after some thought, \u201cAlthough it isn\u2019t bad to go full Intelligence during the beginning periods, Agility is a must if you wish to become a powerful Cursemancer. Aside from just increasing your Movement Speed, Agility can also increase your Casting Speed. Cursemancers have very few lifesaving skills, are slow runners, and have many skills that require chanting. A Cursemancer\u2019s Spells are also weak in power. They mainly rely on Curses to deal damage. However, unlike Elementalists, who are literal cannons, time is required for a Cursemancer to unleash that damage fully. Hence, after adding Intelligence up to 20 points, you should place half of your Free Ability Points into Agility. This will ensure your safety as well as allow you deal more damage.\u201dIn Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, there was an extremely powerful Cursemancer. That person had broken the traditional point-allocation method of a Cursemancer by adding a large amount of Agility. Not only could he deal damage both quickly and fiercely, but he was even more powerful in PK. He had destroyed Assassins that were counters to mages. Even in death, those Assassins had not landed a single hit on that Cursemancer, breaking the law that stated mages would die if they were closed in by a melee player. After that incident, many Cursemancers had started adding Agility, causing Assassins to be endlessly depressed as they became bullied constantly by Cursemancers.Blackie nodded his head. He felt that Shi Feng\u2019s words made sense, saying with a smile, \u201cAlright then. After my Intelligence reaches 20 points, I\u2019ll go full Agility.\u201dAfter finished discussing how to add points for a Cursemancer, Shi Feng and Blackie started picking up the drops.The Kobold Chieftain deserved to be a Chieftain-ranked monster. Adding on that it was the First Kill, its drops were extremely bountiful.It had dropped a total of 8 pieces of Bronze Equipment; 1 Gray Giant Axe, 2 Plate Armor, 2 Leather Armor, 3 Cloth Armor. Aside from those, there were also 273 Coppers and 3 skill books. There was [Mock] for Shield Warriors, [Silent Steps] for Assassins, and [Evil Whip] for Cursemancers.\u201cBlackie, your luck really is too good. This Evil Whip skill book is rare with an extremely low drop rate. It is also one of the few control-and-damage skills that a Cursemancer has. As long as the skill\u2019s level is high, it will become a godly skill for grinding monsters.\u201d Shi Feng tossed the Evil Whip skill book to Blackie without hesitation. He also gave two of the Level 2 Cloth Armor to Blackie.[Evil Whip]Cast time 3 seconds.Use 5 thorns to bind a target in a fixed area. As long as the target exits the area and breaks the thorns, every thorn will cause a base damage of 20 points, with an additional 30% Spell Damage.Cooldown: 20 seconds.Blackie became ecstatic when he saw the skill, learning it quickly. With this skill, his battle standards would be increased by a big leap. After he switched to the two pieces of equipment, it was as if he turned from an air gun into an artillery cannon. Blackie\u2019s Intelligence increased to 20 points, increasing his Spell Damage to 48, and also activating the Hidden Basic Skill for Intelligence, [Rapid Cast].[Rapid Cast]Allows the player to skip the chants of spells that are below 1.5 seconds, requiring only action to cast it.Also, allows the caster to better focus on attacking their target.As for the two pieces of Plate Armor, they were the [Recruit\u2019s Heavy Armor], and [Black Steel Armguard]. However, amongst these pieces of Bronze Equipment, Shi Feng only fancied the Black Steel Armguard\u2019s Attributes.[Black Steel Armguard] (Bronze Rank, Plate Armor)Level 3Equipment Requirements: Strength 9Defense +14Strength +2, Endurance +2, Agility +1Durability 20/20The Recruit\u2019s Heavy Armor was just mediocre. The Level 5 Recruit\u2019s Heavy Armor could not compare to the Sky Armor at all. However, Plate Armors were still precious so it could be sold for a good price.The two pieces of Level 3 Bronze Leather Armor could be sold as well.Amongst these pieces of equipment, the most valuable one was the Gray Giant Ax. It was definitely the darling of Berserkers.[Gray Giant Ax] (Bronze Rank)Level 5Equipment Requirements: Strength 15Attack Power +21Strength +5, Endurance +2Durability 30/30It was the absolute weapon for violence. If a Berserker got ahold of this weapon, their damage would become extremely violent and horrifying.\u201cIf I could create a hype over this Gray Giant Ax, it would definitely be worth a lot of money,\u201d Shi Feng slightly smiled. He had a plan in his heart to make a load of money using the Gray Giant Axe.Afterward, Shi Feng and Blackie returned to the smithy.\u201cMaster Jack, I\u2019ve killed the Kobold Chieftain. This is its skull.\u201d Shi Feng said respectfully as he took out a Kobold\u2019s skull.Master Jack, who was currently hammering away on steel, glanced at the Kobold skull. After he confirmed that Shi Feng had done it, he satisfyingly said, \u201cNot bad, young man. It seems you do have the right to inherit my forging skills.\u201dSystem: Hidden Quest \u2018Road Of Forging\u2019 completed. Player has learned Forging. Player has become a Basic Forging Apprentice. Player has obtained the Forging Talent, \u2018Forging Genius\u2019. Rewarding 10 pieces of [Hundred Refinement Steel][Forging Genius]After a successful forging, there is a fixed chance to increase 2 Proficiency Points.Two Proficiency Points were not to be looked down on. It should be known that a Basic Forging Apprentice making a piece of Common Equipment only had a 20% success rate. After successfully making the equipment, there was a 40% chance to obtain 1 Proficiency Point. Now, however, Shi Feng had a chance to obtain 2 Proficiency Points as long as his forging was successful, increasing his efficiency for promotion to the next rank by several folds.Becoming an Intermediate Forging Apprentice required 1000 Proficiency Points. An average player required more than ten days, at the very least, to become one. Their supply of materials must also be continuous, as the horrifying rate of failure would waste large amounts of materials. With the Forging Talent, Shi Feng could now save a lot of materials, saving him quite the amount of money.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn the other hand, Hundred Refinement Steel was a good Support Material for making Bronze Equipment. It could increase the success rate of making a Bronze Equipment by 10%.With the Forging Talent and Book Of Forging, Shi Feng couldn\u2019t help but wish to start forging equipment immediately. However, he needed materials if he wanted to forge equipment, and in a large amount as well. If he were to collect the materials himself, it would waste too much time. He could only purchase them in bulk. However, that required a lot of money. Not only that, making Common Equipment would not earn him any money, but instead cause him to lose it. Only Bronze Equipment could be sold for a good price, but that required Forging Designs that Shi Feng did not have.\u201cDeathly Forest is a must-go.\u201d Shi Feng thought about the Bronze Equipment Forging Design that could be obtained from within the Deathly Forest. The equipment that could be forged using the Forging Design was both cheap to make and had very good Attributes. In his previous life, there were quite a few Forgers who became rich because of that Design.Just as Shi Feng turned around to leave\u2026\u201cYoung man, you truly make me look differently at you. Even after so many years of forging weapons, it is still my first time seeing a Magic Weapon.\u201d Master Jack called out to Shi Feng. He had sent his gaze towards the pitch-black sword hanging around Shi Feng\u2019s waist. Even if the black sword was rusty and looked like a fire poker, it could not escape the eyes of a Master Forger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His tone was no longer indifferent, but instead a little whispered.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d Shi Feng was at a loss at Master Jack\u2019s sudden initiative request.However, it seemed logical after Shi Feng gave it some thought.The preciousness of a Magic Weapon, not to mention a Famed Sword forged by a master smith, went without saying. A Famed Sword was the lifelong pursuit of every Master Forger. They would definitely want to experience it after seeing one.Seeing Shi Feng hesitating, Master Jack quickly said, \u201cYou can be at ease. I only wish to see it, and I won\u2019t let it be for nothing. If you have any requests, do mention them.\u201dWhen Shi Feng heard this sentence, he became extremely excited.This was a Master Forger!Just by simply forging, he could create a piece of equipment of Mysterious-Iron rank, Secret-Silver rank even. His request was just to have a look at Shi Feng\u2019s sword.Shi Feng agreed without hesitation. He passed the Abyssal Blade over to Master Jack.NPCs couldn\u2019t steal items from players, so he was completely unworried whether or not Master Jack would do away with the Abyssal Blade. He would allow Master Jack to look at it however he wished Afterward, Shi Feng would ask for a Secret-Silver One-handed Sword. By then, he would be able to fully display a Swordsman\u2019s true strength.Master Jack held the Abyssal Blade that looked like a fire poker, both praising the delicateness of the blade and marveling at its strength. After looking at it for over ten minutes, Master Jack unwillingly returned the Abyssal Blade to Shi Feng.\u201cYoung man, this is a good and infinitely powerful sword. However, the curse on this sword is extremely evil. The more you unleash the power of this sword, the stronger the curse will get. At the very end, its wielder will become trapped in the endless Abyss. It will be too difficult if you wish to control this sword with your strength, and the curse will easily devour you,\u201d Master Jack earnestly cautioned.Shi Feng knew about this point. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated for such a long time before binding the Abyssal Blade.\u201cMaster Jack, do you perhaps have any methods to weaken the curse?\u201d Shi Feng asked.Although he knew some weakening methods, he did not have the ability to carry them out right now.\u201cYoung man, you should know that the master smith Olysses forged this sword. There is only one of it in God\u2019s Domain, and only one of the other thirty-five Famed Swords could match up to it. Many unimaginably terrifying existences were killed in order for these Famed Swords to possess unparalleled power. After death, these existences were sealed into each sword by master smiths. It was impossible to suppress these swords without extremely great power.\u201d Master Jack\u2019s tone was filled with unparalleled reverence, but he immediately smiled and said, \u201cHowever, it isn\u2019t that there is no way to weaken the curse.\u201d\u201cMay I ask what kind of method is there?\u201d Shi Feng quickly asked.\u201cIf you wish to suppress a great power, you would need an equally great power to do so. The power sealed within the sword is a curse. If you wish to weaken it, you will need to have sufficiently great luck.\u201d Master Jack lamented, \u201cIn the continent of God\u2019s Domain, some stones have gathered the luck of God\u2019s Domain. These stones are named Lucky Stones. As long as you have a Lucky Stone, then you could counterbalance the curse. Although this piece of stone could be found throughout the whole continent, there are only a very few people who could obtain it. Even I have not seen it before. Trying to find one is truly too difficult. If you can find a piece of this stone, then I can help you weaken the curse on your sword.\u201dSeeing Shi Feng\u2019s slack expression, Master Jack shook his head in consolation, saying, \u201cYoung man, you have to know that the Lucky Stone is extremely rare. You shouldn\u2019t feel discouraged. It is normal not being able to find one. Only those who are blessed by God can obtain a Lucky Stone, and they are people that we cannot compare to.\u201d\u201cMaster Jack, is it this piece of stone?\u201d Shi Feng slightly smiled as he took out the dark-green colored Star Crystal.\u201cRight, this is a Lucky Stone\u2026\u2026\u201d Master Jack nodded his head after seeing the dark-green colored Star Crystal. However, he became stunned a moment later. He was looking at Shi Feng as if he were looking at a monster.Shi Feng shrugged his shoulders, indicating that it was nothing.Shi Feng had been sluggish before because he found out that Master Jack was able to use the Lucky Stone to suppress the Abyssal Blade. It should be known that there was quite a few Master Forgers in the Star-Moon Kingdom. However, the number of Master Forgers capable of using a Lucky Stone to suppress the curse of a Magic Weapon could be counted on a single hand. Shi Feng had never thought that the Master Jack in front of him would be one of them.\u201cMaster Jack, can you weaken the curse now?\u201d Shi Feng asked with anticipation.After a few moments, Master Jack finally recovered to his previous calmness. Pretending to be indifferent, he said, \u201cOk, no problem. I can finish it within half an hour.\u201dTo the side, Blackie held onto his stomach as he tried his best not to laugh. However, Master Jack\u2019s stupefied expression was truly too much for Blackie; he had to run off into the forest before laughing loudly.Half an hour later, Shi Feng received the Abyssal Blade. He discovered some changes to the Abyssal Blade\u2019s introduction.The Abyssal Blade was personally created by master smith Olysses, using the Black Dragon King\u2019s fangs as material. It is one of thirty-six famed swords, and it is ranked 31st. However, this sword has been cursed by the Black Dragon King. Aside from being able to provide the wielder with immense strength, there will be a Backlash every so often. However, after being remodeled by Jack using a Star Crystal, the strength of the Backlash has been greatly reduced. If the wielder is unable to suppress the Backlash, then the wielder will receive the curse of the Black Dragon King, permanently reducing All Attributes by 50%.Shi Feng\u2019s heart relaxed by a lot after seeing the description in this paragraph of words. At the very least, the Backlash won\u2019t be too powerful in a short period of time.Shi Feng stored away the Abyssal Blade. Suddenly, he noticed a lot of messages that had been sent by Lonely Snow. All of the messages asked why Shi Feng had yet to arrive, and how much longer would he need to reach the Deathly Forest.\u201cBlackie, let\u2019s go dive into a Dungeon.\u201d Shi Feng sent a reply message stating that he would come immediately.Because of the issue with the Abyssal Blade, Shi Feng had completely forgotten about the appointed time. He let Lonely Snow wait more than half an hour. However, Shi Feng would make the appropriate compensations within the Deathly Forest.\u201cOkay. I was just worrying that I won\u2019t have a chance to try out my new spells,\u201d Blackie said excitedly.When Shi Feng and Blackie arrived at the Dungeon Area of the Deathly Forest, the entire Deathly Forest was filled with people. Level 2 players were everywhere, and many players were forming parties to enter the Dungeon.\u201cOpen party for Deathly Forest, welcoming violent damage dealers, 4 waiting for 2.\u201d\u201cEffective party for Deathly Forest, we are just missing a powerful healer; guaranteed to clear.\u201dSeeing such a scene, Shi Feng shook his head slightly. He walked towards Lonely Snow who was waving his arm. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, the players had been stuck at the Deathly Forest for a long time. The Dungeon was only cleared when the majority of players were Level 5.\u201cBrother Expert, you\u2019re finally here. Those friends of mine are already becoming impatient from waiting. Let us hurry.\u201d Lonely Snow was burning with anxiety when he saw Shi Feng leisurely walking over.Afterward, Lonely Snow brought Shi Feng and Blackie to the gathering point of the party.\u201cLonely, this is the expert you said? I thought he was a person with three heads and six arms, but it seems he\u2019s nothing more than this.\u201d The male Cleric, Wordless Summer Night saw Shi Feng wearing novice equipment. There was also a fire poker that hung around his waist; it looked as if it was some trash weapon he had randomly picked up. When Wordless Summer Night saw this, he couldn\u2019t help but ridicule.\u201cBrother Wordless, how could you say such things about Brother \u2018Expert\u2019? He is a dignified Beta Tester, so he definitely must have \u2018something extraordinary\u2019. Otherwise, how would he dare to take all equipment for Swordsman and Cursemancer?\u201d The Shield Warrior, Battle To The End, stood to the side and sneered.The two of them had already felt displeasure for Shi Feng. This was because Shi Feng had wanted to take away all Plate Armor and Mage Equipment immediately after joining. Wouldn\u2019t they just be working away for nothing? If it were not for their Boss wanting to have a look at Shi Feng, they would have long since invited other players and dove into the Dungeon. Now that they saw Shi Feng in such poor equipment, they could criticize him and force him to leave.Lonely Snow wanted to retort as Shi Feng was someone he had personally invited. However, Shi Feng\u2019s equipment did not give Lonely Snow any chance to do so. He could only stare in silence.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s party up. A lot of people have already entered the Deathly Forest. If we don\u2019t dive in, we won\u2019t have a chance at competing for the First Kill.\u201d As the party\u2019s leader, the handsome male Ranger, Waving Slowly But Surely interrupted as he said.Blackie wanted to argue back, but Shi Feng stopped him. Shi Feng thought nothing of the two people\u2019s ridicule. No matter what he said, he and Blackie had left them waiting for more than half an hour, so couldn\u2019t he just let them speak a few more sentences?Just as they finished partying up, the Shield Warrior furiously said, \u201cCrap, this noob is just Level 1! He\u2019s just here to swindle equipment!\u201d\u201cBoss, Deathly Forest is a Level 2 Dungeon. If we let a Level 1 noob enter the Dungeon, aren\u2019t we just waiting to get wiped?\u201d Wordless Summer Night looked towards the Ranger, Waving Slowly, showing his displeasure.Lonely Snow was equally shocked when he saw Shi Feng\u2019s level.It should be known that many players had already risen to Level 2. How was it possible for a Beta Tester not to reach Level 2?Boss Waving Slowly looked towards Shi Feng. Before this, he still had some hope for Shi Feng, but now it was all gone. He suddenly said in a cold tone, \u201cDid you die once before this?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d Shi Feng shook his head, honestly saying: \u201cHowever, entering Deathly Forest at Level 1 is enough.\u201d\u201cThen you can go now. We don\u2019t need such an \u2018expert\u2019 like you here. We hope you can understand.\u201d Waving Slowly coldly said, his brows slightly wrinkled.\u201cBoss, this must be a misunderstanding. How about we try it out first?\u201d Lonely Snow explained.\u201cTry it out?\u201d Wordless Summer coldly laughed, \u201cThen who will be responsible when we die? You should know that we still lose experience if we die in a Dungeon. Although it is low, that is still 10%. Can this noob repay such a loss?\u201d\u201cWordless, don\u2019t make it hard for Lonely.\u201d Waving Slowly repeatedly said, \u201cLonely, I know you are trying to cover for this Swordsman, but I have to take responsibility for our party. I will only find veterans to enter the Dungeon. I will not waste time partying up with a novice. You have two choices now; one is to follow us into the Dungeon, two is to leave the party together with them.\u201d\u201cI will leave the party.\u201d Shi Feng did not want to embarrass Lonely Snow. He immediately left the party, turning to leave, \u201cBlackie, we\u2019ll party up with other people and enter the Dungeon.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Blackie smiled with a \u2018hehe\u2019, leaving the party without a second thought.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHumph, humph. The \u2018expert\u2019s identity has been seen through. At least he has some self-awareness to leave after knowing he can\u2019t swindle equipment anymore.\u201d The Shield Warrior grinned and jeered, \u201cLonely, you really are gullible. Such a noob would trick only you. You need to learn properly from Boss Waving Slowly in the future.\u201dLonely Snow\u2019s face turned livid after hearing this. However, he did not feel that he was mistaken; Shi Feng was definitely an expert.\u201cBoss Waving Slowly, sorry for this.\u201d Lonely Snow chose to leave the party. He was prepared to join Shi Feng in order to determine whether or not his judgment was correct.\u201cYou!\u201d Waving Slowly was immediately stunned. He never thought Lonely Snow would be so decisive. It was simply a foolish decision. He would have long since chased Lonely Snow away if it wasn\u2019t because he had good techniques.Wordless Summer Night looked towards Lonely Snow, saying with a cold smile, \u201cLonely, you better not regret the choice you made. You\u2019ll regret when we clear the Deathly Forest and obtain great equipment. You\u2019ll regret it for ten years, twenty years that you didn\u2019t follow Boss Waving Slowly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He only lowered his head and left, chasing after Shi Feng.Waving Slowly squinted his eyes. When he thought about Shi Feng equipped in a body of trash equipment, he could not understand what methods Shi Feng had used to cause Lonely Snow to follow him. Lonely Snow had even given up on the clearing Deathly Forest.\u201cBoss, let\u2019s ignore that foolish Lonely Snow. At worst, we\u2019ll start looking for people again. There are plenty of Level 2 players now,\u201d Battle To The End said in disdain as he watched Lonely Snow.Waving Slowly nodded his head. Lonely Snow\u2019s leaving did not cause any loss to their party. As for Shi Feng creating a party to dive into the Deathly Forest, not to mention clearing the Dungeon, nobody would go in with a Level 1 player.In front of the Deathly Forest\u2019s entrance, Shi Feng and Blackie continuously shouted to recruit people.\u201cOpen party for Deathly Forest, no rigid requirements, OK as long as you\u2019re a veteran gamer. 2 waiting for 4.\u201d Shi Feng shouted.When everyone heard of it, many Level 2 players had run over. It was because Shi Feng\u2019s requirements were very low. Many small parties would choose people based on equipment quality; they needed a few pieces of Common Equipment to pass. However, who would have that many pieces of Common Equipment in the early periods of the game?\u201cParty me, party me! I\u2019m already a Level 2 Cleric.\u201d\u201cParty me! I\u2019m a Level 2 Shield Warrior. I also have a piece of Level 1 Common Plate Armor Armguard.\u201dIn just a moment, Shi Feng had invited 4 people.These 4 people were quite happy originally. There were over ten people currently present, but only they were chosen. However, after they saw the party leader, Shi Feng\u2019s level, they left the party in rage one after another.\u201cFuck, it\u2019s just a noob coming to die in the Deathly Forest at Level 1. If you want to enter the Dungeon, enter it by yourself. I won\u2019t accompany you.\u201d\u201cNo wonder there are no requirements for the party. Want us to give you a ride? Not a chance.\u201dThe 4 people were extremely enraged, and the voices they made were practically roars; every player at the Deathly Forest could hear it.\u201cHehe, even a Level 1 player dares boast about entering the Deathly Forest. He just wants to tag along for experience and equipment. Lucky for me I didn\u2019t go over.\u201d\u201cThere are all sorts of birds in a large forest. Who would be foolish enough to enter the Dungeon with a Level 1 noob? Isn\u2019t that just looking to be abused?\u201dOne after another, the Level 2 players laughed at Shi Feng for overestimating himself and for his foolishness.\u201cGet lost if you don\u2019t wish to party up. We\u2019re not begging you all to come.\u201d Blackie became enraged after listening to them. Shi Feng\u2019s techniques had long since convinced him, yet these people were calling Shi Feng a noob. Can a noob kill a Level 2 Rare Elite when he was Level 2? Can a noob kill a Level 5 Chieftain when he was Level 0? These people were just a group of snobs and idiots.\u201cCrap, my knowledge has been widened. A Level 1 noob party can be awesome. I really want to see how you two gather a full party.\u201d The Cleric that just left the party said with a cold smile.At this moment, Lonely Snow ran over. When he saw Shi Feng, he hurriedly said, \u201cBrother Expert, give me an invite. I want to enter the Deathly Forest together with you guys. I have 2 pieces of Common Plate Armor Equipment on me, Defense is 24.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Shi Feng immediately sent an invitation.Blackie never imagined that Lonely Snow would actually leave his original party and come to them. He suddenly had a good impression of Lonely Snow. Blackie clapped Lonely Snow\u2019s shoulders, heartily laughing, \u201cYou have good eyes. Don\u2019t worry; following Brother Feng definitely won\u2019t be a mistake.\u201d\u201cNonsense, nonsense.\u201d Lonely Snow was still slightly worried within his heart. The grinding spot Shi Feng had simply pointed him to had allowed him to rise to Level 2 quickly. However, Shi Feng himself hadn\u2019t even reached Level 2, and he was still wearing very poor equipment. Lonely Snow just couldn\u2019t understand how it could be so.The spectating players by the side all became dumbfounded. There was actually someone who would enter the Dungeon with a Level 1 noob. This person had good equipment, at that. The brand new Plate Armor and Boots on Lonely Snow must definitely be Common Equipment and not Trash Equipment.Although Lonely Snow had joined the party, not a single player had joined them after Shi Feng had recruited for over ten minutes. With just 3 of them alone, it was impossible to enter and clear the Dungeon.At this moment, Waving Slowly But Surely brought a group of people.\u201cHehe, Brother \u2018Expert\u2019 still hasn\u2019t partied anybody? We\u2019ve already invited another 3 strong members. All of them have at least two or three pieces of Level 1 Common Equipment.\u201d The Cleric, Endless Summer Night, said to Shi Feng in ridicule.Waving Slowly only sent a glance towards Shi Feng, then moved his sight towards Lonely Snow, saying, \u201cYou won\u2019t have a future if you follow him around. Before we enter the Dungeon, you could still consider it over properly. I guarantee that you definitely won\u2019t suffer a loss.\u201dAfterward, Waving Slowly shifted his gaze towards Blackie. Previously, all his attention had been on Shi Feng, having ignored Blackie. Now that he took a closer look, Blackie\u2019s clothing looked brand new. Blackie was even holding a Blackwood Staff. His equipment should be quite good, and he was also Level 2, so his techniques should be good as well.\u201cYou\u2019re not bad as well. Why don\u2019t you join our party? You should know that we are an Elite Party. It\u2019s not something average players could compare to. If we\u2019re together, leveling, grinding, and Dungeon diving will be easy.\u201d Waving Slowly looked at Blackie with a smile.\u201cGet lost. Trying to poach me over just based on your little party?\u201d Blackie scolded as he pointed is Blackwood Staff at Waving Slowly. At the same time, he had selected to display the halo effect of the Bronze Equipment, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just two to three pieces of Common Equipment. I have three Bronze Equipment and two Common Equipment.\u201dWaving Slowly and the others were shocked. They never thought Blackie was that powerful. He actually possessed three pieces of Bronze Equipment. During this period of time, a person having two to three pieces of Common Equipment was considered an expert. As for having a piece of Bronze Equipment, that person would definitely be an expert; every Guild would fight over for that person. However, the Blackie before them actually had three pieces of Bronze Equipment.Waving Slowly\u2019s party also became surprised. When they saw the halo effect of the Bronze Equipment, their eyes had nearly popped out of their sockets.No wonder Shi Feng behaved that boldly. Shi Feng had nothing to fear because he had grabbed an expert\u2019s favor.Meanwhile, Lonely Snow who stood beside Blackie was slackjawed. He looked at Blackie in disbelief. Lonely Snow had originally thought of Shi Feng as a rarely seen expert. He had never imagined that Blackie was the true great expert.\u201cFellow brother, if you party up with such a noob and enter the Dungeon, it would also be a burden on you. Not to mention failing to clear the Dungeon, you might even have to die once. How about you come with us. All pieces of mage equipment from the Dungeon are free for you to choose from.\u201d Although Waving Slowly was enraged for being given such a slap, if he could rope over Blackie, then the chances for clearing the Dungeon would become a lot greater.\u201cI agree with your views. Joining a group of noobs such as yourselves really will be a burden to me\u201d Blackie chuckled.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Waving Slowly\u2019s face turned beet red, furiously saying, \u201cThen let\u2019s see who clears the Deathly Forest first.\u201dFinishing his piece, Waving Slowly spun around and left. He did not believe that a party with a noob in it could clear the Deathly Forest.\u201cHumph, he\u2019s just a powerful damage dealer entering the Dungeon. Does he really think he could clear it?\u201d Wordless Summer jealously murmured.\u201cRight. We are all veteran gamers. We are definitely stronger in Dungeon-diving than they are,\u201d The Shield Warrior curled his lips.After Waving Slowly\u2019s party left, the number of people applying for Shi Feng\u2019s party had also suddenly increased.Such an effect was mainly caused by the equipment that Blackie wore.At this period, Bronze Equipment was definitely the proof of an expert. Even if there was a noob as the party leader, an expert with three pieces of Bronze Equipment could be considered as strong as two people. The advantage of having such an expert was definitely greater than an average party.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, Shi Feng was no longer inviting people at random this time; there was a definite requirement. Such an action had caused the four players who had left Shi Feng\u2019s party previously to regret immensely. How could they have acted on impulse? Now, Shi Feng wouldn\u2019t give them a chance even if they wished to join.Just as Shi Feng was fervently recruiting party members\u2026At the Southwest part of the Deathly Forest Dungeon\u2019s entrance, a great disturbance suddenly appeared. Many players had run over, one after another, every one of them having excited expressions.\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Meeting in such a place?\u201cBlackie\u2019s two eyes stared straight ahead.Shi Feng was also shocked. They could even meet such an important figure in a small location like Red Leaf Town. It was just unimaginable. Could it be that Red Leaf Town was a place that had crouching tigers and hidden dragons; only, Shi Feng had never discovered it before?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22 \u2013 Recruitment StormAs more players started going there, Shi Feng\u2019s area turned leisurely.\u201cBrother Feng, I\u2019m not seeing things, right? Or am I dreaming right now?\u201d Blackie rubbed his eyes as he asked with uncertainty.Shi Feng was speechless. With a bitter smile, he looked towards the three-man party that caused this disturbance.The newcomer was not just anybody; she was Blackie\u2019s idol, Goddess Gentle Snow. Gentle Snow\u2019s body was covered in a suit of gorgeous silver-colored Plate Armor, revealing her fine and curvaceous body. Adding to her angelic beauty and snow-cold temperament, even women\u2019s hearts would be moved by her, as well as a large group of men.Even Shi Feng couldn\u2019t help but admit that Gentle Snow was the most perfect woman he had seen before, be it regarding appearances, body, or temperament. There was not a single female celebrity who could match up to her.As for the two people on each side of Gentle Snow, Shi Feng was very familiar with them as well. He had seen them before on big news channels. They were all famous experts in God\u2019s Domain.One of them was also an absolute beauty named Zhao Yueru. If Gentle Snow could be said to possess a perfect body and appearance, then Zhao Yueru possessed a devilishly enticing body and appearance. Every one of her movements was like a temptation that could influence a person\u2019s heart. Adding on the fiery red robe that she wore, her body radiated a wild-like charm.Such bewildering charms had caused many men wanting to go over and assault her.If you really did such a thing, however, then congratulations. You\u2019ve just earned a one-way ticket directly to hell.This was because words such as \u2018big breasts, no brains\u2019 and \u2018as delicate as a flower\u2019 were not applicable to Zhao Yueru. In God\u2019s domain, she had another nickname of the Flame Witch. The reason why she held this title was that of the mountain of corpses she had piled up using these male players.There had once been a Guild Leader of a large Guild that had tried assaulting Zhao Yueru. As a result, the Guild that had over a hundred thousand players became no more; Zhao Yueru even hunted their Guild Leader. The incident only came to an end when that Guild Leader was killed back to Level 0. From then on, the title of Flame Witch had been cast on Zhao Yueru.Compared to the Snow Goddess and Flame Witch, the Priestess by their side could only be considered normal. She was not overly beautiful, her techniques were not bad, and she was also within the top hundred rankings of Star-Moon Kingdom\u2019s Priest Leaderboard.Two absolute beauties plus a great beauty, such a combination had created brilliant scenery in the Deathly Forest. Hundreds of players surrounded them, trying to become acquainted with the three women. Unfortunately, the three beauties did not even look at them.\u201cSister Yueru, these people are really scary. How about we return and level up?\u201d The timid Xiao Yue\u2019er whispered.\u201cHehe, Yue\u2019er, don\u2019t be afraid. With Gentle Snow here, even if you give these hateful, vulgar men ten times the courage, they wouldn\u2019t dare come over here,\u201d Zhao Yueru said with a smile, proudly sticking out her chest.Gentle Snow only nodded her head in reply. Regarding these salivating, vulgar men, she did not even place them in her eyes.\u201cAlthough the drops from Elite monsters are not bad, the drop rate for skill books is higher at the Deathly Forest. If we don\u2019t grind for a few more skill books, we will level up very slowly in the future,\u201d Gentle Snow quietly said.Zhao Yueru nodded her head in agreement. Although the three of them had killed quite many Elite monsters, the number of skill books that dropped was very little. Until now, the three of them had yet to learn even three skills. It was really affecting their strength utilization and grinding efficiency.\u201cEffective party for Deathly Forest, looking for a healer and MT, 3 waiting for 3.\u201d After taking a few looks, Shi Feng continued shouting.Although Gentle Snow and Zhao Yueru were indeed attractive, Shi Feng was no longer a child. He had seen plenty of beauties, especially after he became Shadow\u2019s Captain; many beauties would willingly throw themselves at Shi Feng. As for Gentle Snow and Zhao Yueru, it was good enough to just look at them for pleasure. Such beauties were not something Shi Feng could have thoughts about. His main goal right now was to get down to business.However, Shi Feng\u2019s shouting did not yield any replies. Not a single player had even glanced at him. All of them were staring and salivating at Gentle Snow\u2019s group of three. Even Blackie was no exception; his eyes had nearly popped out of their sockets from staring.Shi Feng sighed, helplessly shaking his head and continued shouting and recruiting people.\u201cCrap, what is this fool blabbering about? Do you really think anybody would commit suicide together with you in the Dungeon?\u201d\u201cQuickly scram, you Level 1 noob! Stop distracting me from looking at beauties.\u201dQuite a few players started to express their discontentment. Two high-quality beauties had already shown up, yet instead of trying to get closer to them, Shi Feng was actually making noise here. What would you do if those beauties were scared off?\u201cThat person is interesting. He can actually attract the hostility of so many people. Did he do something immoral before?\u201d Xiao Yue\u2019er revealed a crescent moon-like smile, giggling as she pointed at Shi Feng.Zhao Yueru aimed her eyes over as well. She felt nothing special from Shi Feng. He was even dressed in tattered clothing. Zhao Yueru felt that Shi Feng was just trying to seek attention from the crowd. She suddenly said in disdain, \u201cHe is definitely doing so to grab our attention. Let\u2019s not bother with him and quickly party up 3 people to dive the Dungeon.\u201dRegarding the number of men who had tried to attract their attention, there were just too many of them. Zhao Yueru had seen all kinds of methods these men had used before, and Shi Feng\u2019s method was not a rare sight at all, but instead outdated.Gentle Snow did not voice out any opinions, only taking a look at Shi Feng. She felt an odd feeling coming from Shi Feng; this was the spirit of a hidden sword. Gentle Snow was especially concerned about the fire poker hanging around Shi Feng\u2019s waist.\u201cGentle Snow, what happened to you?\u201d Zhao Yueru curiously looked at Gentle Snow. She did not understand why Gentle Snow would keep staring at the extremely ordinary Shi Feng.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Maybe it\u2019s just my imagination. We should hurry up and recruit some people to dive the Dungeon.\u201d Gentle Snow shook her head, no longer looking at the fire poker at Shi Feng\u2019s waist.Originally, Shi Feng\u2019s party already had trouble recruiting for people. However, because of Zhao Yueru\u2019s single sentence, nobody else had paid attention to Shi Feng\u2019s party; even if his party had an expert present.Shi Feng expressed his helplessness when seeing the hundreds of players queuing up in front of Zhao Yueru. The three women\u2019s arrival had really bad timing.\u201cBrother Feng, why don\u2019t we go over there as well,\u201d Blackie shamelessly suggested.\u201cScram! What do you take me for?\u201d Shi Feng rolled his eyes at Blackie. This fellow was just too shameless, forgetting friendship after finding love. Instead, Lonely Snow was the better one. He was a truly honest man. In the beginning, Lonely Snow had only taken a few glances but stopped after giving out a few praises. He had even helped Shi Feng in recruiting people by his side.Blackie did not dare to speak again after being scolded by Shi Feng. He could only silently look on in envy at those players in the queue.Over ten minutes later, Shi Feng still had not recruited a single person. Similarly, Gentle Snow\u2019s party had also not recruited a single person. However, in Shi Feng\u2019s case, it was because nobody had come to join his party. Whereas for Gentle Snow\u2019s party, it was because the players that wanted to join did not match up to their specifications. One party was in heaven, while the other was on earth.Shi Feng had no more choices. He could not just continue dragging on in such a way; his time was precious. He could only make exceptions in recruiting.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cEfficient party for Deathly Forest, we have an expert leading the party, clear in one try, no limit to levels, looking for healers and damage dealers, 3 waiting for 3.\u201dHowever, Shi Feng\u2019s words had caused many players to send over looks of disdain.Even if you were trying to attract attention, you should have a lower line!Currently, there had already been tens of Level 2 players who had died out of the Dungeon. Every one of them had said the Deathly Forest was impossible to clear. On the other hand, Shi Feng said his party had no level limits. Then wasn\u2019t he trying to say that he only needed one person to clear the Deathly Forest? Was this possible?However, Shi Feng lower line had still attracted some player\u2019s attention. Within a few moments, a group of Level 1 players had come running over to join.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23 \u2013 Tyrant BearTens of Level 1 players came running over. The area in front of Shi Feng\u2019s party had also started becoming lively.\u201cThis person is really something. He is so desperate to enter the Dungeon that he would even want Level 1 noobs. Did he not know that there has already been a Level 2 Elite party that had returned after dying?\u201d\u201cWho cares about him. A noob is a noob after all. We won\u2019t be able to understand their thoughts.\u201dThe long queue of Level 2 players started laughing one after another at Shi Feng\u2019s actions. They all wanted to watch Shi Feng become a joke.\u201cThose guys are really interesting. Even I don\u2019t have much confidence in clearing the Deathly Forest, yet they actually want to clear it with a group of Level 1 players.\u201d Zhao Yueru\u2019s lips curled up slightly, revealing an exuberant smile as she looked in Shi Feng\u2019s direction. Her voice carried a hint of ridicule and disdain.Gentle Snow also sent a glance towards Shi Feng from a distance. Shi Feng\u2019s temperament was both calm and confident. He did not become angry from being laughed at. Every one of his movements was very mature, not much different from the experts in God\u2019s Domain she had seen before. However, she did not understand from where Shi Feng\u2019s confidence came. Deathly Forest was Red Leaf Town\u2019s first Dungeon, and it was also everyone\u2019s first time being in touch with a Dungeon in God\u2019s Domain; their difficulties were an unknown. Even the Elite parties of Guilds would carefully choose their members before entering the Dungeon. On the other hand, Shi Feng did not care in the slightest, as if just gathering 6 players was good enough.\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just overthinking things. He\u2019s just a Level 1 player, so how could he clear the Deathly Forest.\u201d Gentle Snow caressed her elegant hair, her heart no longer thinking about Shi Feng\u2019s odd actions. She looked at her hand, at the player information displayed on it, \u201cLevel 2 Summoner, Magic Attack 28, HP 150, Defense 8, Movement Speed 4. Fail. Next.\u201dAfterward, another Cursemancer stepped forward. The person tensely sent his own Attributes to the Snow Goddess, Gentle Snow.On the other side, Shi Feng as well was looking at player data.Although he did not have a lower line, he did have a bottom line.The equipment and levels of these Level 1 players were much worse than the Level 2 players that Gentle Snow\u2019s party were recruiting. However, they were still players. As long as they did not simply add their 8 Free Attribute Points early on, the chance of clearing the Deathly Forest with a 6-man party was very high.As for those Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights who solely added Strength or Weapons Job but did not add Agility, all of them were rejected.\u201cBig brother, please party me. Although I am just a Level 1 Guardian Knight, I have a piece of Level 0 Common Equipment. Also, all 8 of my Attribute Points are still available. I can completely add them based on your requirements. \u201c A youth named Cola pleaded, his eyes filled with expectations.Shi Feng was slightly surprised. A Guardian Knight that did not add any Attribute Points could actually reach Level 1. It was a masterpiece. It had to be known that Guardian Knights had very low Attack, making the killing of monsters difficult. Normally, they would party up to kill monsters. To increase grinding efficiency, they would add a few points of Strength. Otherwise, leveling up would be too slow.Guardian Knight Cola?\u201cCola\u2026\u2026 Cola.\u201d When Shi Feng looked at Cola\u2019s face, and also his tall and muscular body, he felt that it was somewhat familiar. Suddenly, he entered into deep thought. His memory seemed to have such a person in it.That\u2019s right! It\u2019s Tyrant Bear!Shi Feng managed to remember it; Tyrant Bear\u2019s name was Cola. Tyrant Bear was the core MT of the first-rate Guild, [Brilliant Stars]. During the early periods of God\u2019s Domain, Tyrant Bear was constantly unsuccessful. He was even kicked out by third-rate Guild, [Heaven\u2019s Crown]. After entering Brilliant Stars, Cola suddenly started to shine. He turned from being a normal party\u2019s MT into the core elite party\u2019s MT in the Guild. He was ranked fifteenth on the Guardian Knight Leaderboard of Star-Moon Kingdom. Cola was known for both being able to attack and defend. Shi Feng had never thought that the Tyrant Bear would run up to him on his own. Cola was such a shy person, as well. It was totally different from the Tyrant Bear of ten years later.Suddenly, Shi Feng had an idea.Currently, the Tyrant Bear had yet to join Heaven\u2019s Crown, not to mention Brilliant Stars. If Shi Feng could poach Cola over and turn Cola into his own MT, then wouldn\u2019t Dungeon-diving in the future be a lot easier?\u201cBig brother, I guarantee that I will absolutely listen to your commands when inside the Dungeon. Please consider it over,\u201d Cola\u2019s tone carried hints of begging.Shi Feng had nearly let loose a laugh. The great Tyrant Bear would actually speak in such whispered tones just for a position in the Dungeon. However, Shi Feng still held it in.The Level 1 players that had come here all held hopes of getting lucky. The other parties that entered the Deathly Forest with Level 2 players were already no good, not to mention Level 1 players like them. If they could enter once into the Deathly Forest and fortunately obtain one or two pieces of equipment, then it would be of great help to their future development. At that time, entering into a large Guild would become much easier.\u201cAlright, I can add you in.\u201d Shi Feng\u2019s face turned grave as he said, \u201cHowever, you should know that bringing a Level 1 noob like you into the Deathly Forest isn\u2019t easy. I can\u2019t just carry you through the Deathly Forest, and then after you get equipment, you join some other elite parties. Wouldn\u2019t I just be striving for nothing?\u201dWhen Shi Feng finished his speech, quite a few Level 1 players had suddenly sent over looks of disdain. Weren\u2019t you also a Level 1 noob?However, Shi Feng did not care about what these people felt. He continued saying, \u201cI wish to form a stable party. Even if we need members, it would be with stability as the priority. If you wish to enter the Dungeon, you need to be prepared for the long term. When I call you for Dungeon-diving, you must come. You cannot reject because you have some other matters. So, what will be your choice?\u201dWhen the other players heard Shi Feng saying so, they suddenly turned quiet.Shi Feng\u2019s intentions were very clear. If you wish to enter the party, then you won\u2019t be able to join other parties in the future, not to mention joining a Guild.Everybody knew that entering a Guild was the best method to increase your own strength quickly.Currently, they did not have the qualifications to join any of those Guilds. So, they were here to try their luck, hoping to obtain one or two pieces of equipment. They might even be able to join those Guilds afterward. So, how would they be able to give up their chances of entering a good Guild just to enter a Dungeon.?Cola had also never imagined that Shi Feng would give such a demand. However, it was still reasonable. You couldn\u2019t just expect other people to bring you up, then leave when you become strong. However, Shi Feng lacked the persuasiveness when he said these words.At this moment, Blackie stood out and furiously said, \u201cJust looking at you noobs, there is nobody that would want you down in the Dungeon. And you still wish to join a Guild in the future and enjoy their benefits? Are you thinking yourselves as experts, or are you taking us for idiots?\u201dCola thought what Blackie, the \u2018expert,\u2019 had said made sense. Even a Level 2 expert with three pieces of Bronze Equipment was in this party, whereas Cola himself was just a novice noob. So, what right did he have to complain?\u201cMany thanks for Big Brother Expert\u2019s pointers. Little brother will definitely strive to fulfill his own role.\u201d Cola continuously thanked Blackie.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBlackie felt somewhat uneasy from being thanked and referred to as an expert by Cola. Blackie was just a complete impostor of an expert. However, being called such by someone made Blackie want to become an expert in God\u2019s Domain even more.\u201cBlackie, beautifully done!\u201d Shi Feng stretched out a thumbs-up, quietly praising Blackie.Shi Feng never imagined Blackie would tame the Tyrant Bear just like that. The Tyrant Bear had also called Blackie a Big Brother with a face full of respect.Blackie suddenly became confused. He did not understand what he had done that was worth being praised by Shi Feng. However, he was still very happy. At least he had done something for Shi Feng; although he didn\u2019t know what he had done exactly.Over ten minutes later, Shi Feng finally gathered six players. They could start Dungeon-diving now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24 \u2013 Hell\u2019s RoarAlthough Shi Feng\u2019s party was gathered, the observing Level 2 players had started laughing.They were not laughing because all the players Shi Feng had invited were Level 1. Instead, the Jobs that were in the party were just too exotic. They couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud.\u201cThis noob really is something, and even I am starting to admire him. They\u2019re simply a suicide party.\u201d\u201cI really pity that expert for actually bringing along such an exotic player. The expert had even agreed to let him be the party\u2019s leader.\u201dThe queued up Level 2 players started a debate, and there were quite a few players who were holding their stomachs while laughing loudly.\u201cHe is just playing to the gallery.\u201d Zhao Yueru wrinkled her brows slightly. She turned her head away after taking a look at Shi Feng, her heart slightly discomforted. Before, she would be the focus of everyone wherever she went. Today, however, everyone\u2019s attention was on an inconspicuous noob like Shi Feng. Although everyone was jeering at him, he was still their focal point.\u201cAlright Yueru, we should hurry and gather enough people. If we waste any more time, we will be left behind by the frontline players.\u201d Although Gentle Snow felt that Shi Feng seemed to be an expert, regarding levels, methods of recruiting people and such, he was just too far from being referred to as an expert. As for the notion of inviting Shi Feng into their Guild, it was no longer present now. Their Ouroboros only accepted experts.\u201cGot it.\u201d Zhao Yueru turned towards the Swordsman in front of her. With a little vengeance, she directly said, \u201cData\u2019s not bad, but too bad we don\u2019t want a Swordsman.\u201dThe Swordsman suddenly became spiritless. How could he not see what Zhao Yueru meant? Subsequently, he turned his head and glared at the distant Shi Feng, his eyes filled with hatred.Meanwhile, Shi Feng, who knew nothing about what has happened, was currently activating the Deathly Forest.System: Please select activation difficulty.System: Normal, Hard, Hell.Shi Feng chose Hell without hesitation. Suddenly, the Transfer Passage in front of the Deathly Forest changed. It changed from a silvery-gray color to pitch-black. At the same time, a flickering skull that had its mouth wide opened could vaguely be seen.Meanwhile, the party members of Shi Feng\u2019s party all received a notification.System: You have chosen Hell Mode of Deathly Forest. Death penalty increased by 100%.Suddenly, the faces of the members of the party turned deathly white. Death penalty increased by 100%, doesn\u2019t that mean if they died within the Dungeon, they would lose 20% of their EXP? One or two hours of effort were required to make up for that EXP.\u201cBrother Feng, you chose the wrong one. Aren\u2019t we going down the Normal Dungeon?\u201d Blackie hurriedly walked over and whispered a reminder.\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s Hell Mode. What would I be doing here if it isn\u2019t to dive Hell Mode?\u201d Shi Feng snapped.The drop rate for forging designs was extremely low. If it was Normal Mode, then Werewolf Felt\u2019s drop rate was only 1%; Hard Mode had 5% and Hell Mode had 30%. Although Normal Mode could be cleared without limit every day, who would have so much time to do so? Meanwhile, Hard Mode could only be cleared 5 times a day, and the probability of the forging design to drop was also not great. As for Hell Mode, it could only be cleared once a day, but it was also the one that had the most hopes of dropping it.\u201cFeng\u2026\u2026 Brother Feng, what are you saying? Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest? Just look at our party. It is problematic to even clear Normal Mode, not to mention Hell Mode,\u201d Blackie panicked. Before, he had already seen several Elite parties that had returned after dying. According to what these people had said, the monsters in the Deathly Forest were extremely strong. Their intelligence was extremely high as well. It was impossible to beat them without reaching Level 4 or 5, so they had all left after giving up.If they dove into a Hell Mode Dungeon now, with noobs like them, that would truly be going down into Hell.\u201cRelax. If I weren\u2019t certain, even I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Shi Feng clapped Blackie\u2019s shoulders, saying confidently with a smile.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go inside then.\u201dShi Feng led the party by entering first, followed by Blackie. Lonely Snow had also entered with a dazed head; he was prepared to tread this path to the very end.As for the remaining three, they hesitated for quite some time.\u201cWe better go in. The expert has already gone inside, so what do we, Level 1 noobs, still have to be reluctant for? Moreover, we\u2019re entering the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest. Even mentioning it would be a glory,\u201d Cola encouraged.The other two felt that it made sense and had also followed into the Dungeon.Meanwhile, the area in front of Gentle Snow\u2019s party was completely silent. All of the Level 2 players were stunned. They were not just shocked, but thunderstruck. A Level 2 Elite party couldn\u2019t even clear the Normal Mode, yet a party that mainly consisted of Level 1 players had actually chosen the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest.\u201cSnow, did I see wrong? That\u2019s Hell Mode, right?\u201d Zhao Yueru asked.Gentle Snow nodded her head; her beautiful eyes kept staring at the flickering skull. Her expression turned extremely serious.\u201cThat fellow must\u2019ve abandoned himself to despair, entering Hell Mode after determining that he couldn\u2019t clear the Normal Mode. We\u2019ll see how they come out dead in a moment.\u201d Zhao Yueru laughed.\u201cWe don\u2019t have that sort of time. Let\u2019s go, we\u2019ve gathered enough people.\u201dGentle Snow led the way towards the Deathly Forest Dungeon. She selected Normal Mode for the difficulty of the Dungeon. If there were no problems with Normal Mode, they would enter Hard Mode after.Within the Dungeon of the Deathly Forest, there was a dark and gloomy forest. From time to time, there would be a chill wind blowing, causing a shiver down one\u2019s body.Aside from Shi Feng himself, every member of his party was tightly packed around the Dungeon\u2019s entrance. They did not move even an inch for fear of attracting any monsters that would wipe their party.\u201cBrother Feng, why do I keep feeling a cold wind blowing by my back?\u201d Blackie asked in worry.\u201cBlackie, you need to bring out some temperament of an expert, only then will you have the possibility to become one. It is just Hell Mode. Aside from the monsters here having a little bit intelligence, their battle methods being a little bit complicated, and their Attack, Defense, and HP are a little bit higher, there isn\u2019t much else. Oh right, there is also a little bit more monsters here.\u201d After some thought, Shi Feng felt that he had nothing more to add.Suddenly, every member of the party sent looks of disdain towards Shi Feng.When diving a Dungeon, even a small difference in Attack and HP could cause a team wipe. As for Shi Feng, he had just simply explained. Moreover, what did he mean by \u2018just a little more intelligence?\u2019 They had experienced before the battles with monsters in God\u2019s Domain. Regarding those monsters with slightly higher intelligence, even with the same Attack and HP, their strength would still be increased by one or two folds.\u201cAlright, alright, stop minding these little matters. I\u2019ll be explaining the strategy for this Dungeon in a moment, so you guys better listen carefully. If you don\u2019t follow through, then your lives will become forfeit.\u201d Shi Feng waved his hands, ready to start explaining the strategy to conquer the Dungeon.Suddenly, a strong wind blew from the dark and gloomy forest, causing the trees to sway madly.\u201cAo! Ao! Ao!\u201dAfter the howling wind came a furious roar that resounded throughout the entire Deathly Forest. Countless birds were scared, flying off into the sky.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBlackie and the others were stunned by such an imposing aura.They were just youths around the age of 20. They had never experienced any great hardships, not to mention being tempered through life-or-death situations. It was their first time facing such a lung-piercing roar. Compared to hearing the traditional roar of a tiger in the forest, this roar was much more shocking to the human heart.\u201cThis thing is what we should pay attention to.\u201d Shi Feng calmly said at this moment.The largest difference between Hell Mode and Hard Mode was this roar.Although it did not have a specific name to it, the players in Shi Feng\u2019s previous life had dubbed it as \u201cHell\u2019s Roar\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25 \u2013 Night RangerShi Feng\u2019s words confused the other members.Wasn\u2019t it just a roar? What was there to pay attention to?When Shi Feng looked at everyone\u2019s contemptuous expressions, he couldn\u2019t help but gravely say \u201cListen well you all. Hell\u2019s Roar is not as simple as what you think it is. In a moment, follow my demands while advancing. If anyone makes a mistake, don\u2019t blame me for immediately kicking you out of the party.\u201dBeing lectured by Shi Feng in such a way, the other members all became serious. Nobody wished to leave the party.\u201cIn a moment, Cola and I will walk in front. Lonely Snow, you walk in the middle and protect the Oracle. Blackie, you and the Summoner will walk at the back. Remember, you must not break formation regardless of any activities. Without my command, nobody is allowed to be the first to attack, do you all understand?\u201d Shi Feng explained the basics of formations once to the party.The reason Shi Feng had allowed the Guardian Knight, Cola, to walk in front was that he let Cola add all of his Free Ability Points into Endurance. His HP now reached 310 points. With this much HP, Cola could resist a little longer, sharing some of Shi Feng\u2019s burden.The Dungeons in God\u2019s domain were unlike the Dungeons in other virtual reality games. The degree of freedom within the Dungeon was high, and the Dungeons, themselves, were very large. There were even quite a few player parties who had wandered around in the Dungeon for hours without even meeting a single Boss. Although the Deathly Forest was not as large, it was still possible to become lost within the dark and gloomy forest.If someone were to become lost\u2026Shi Feng only wished to say \u2018hehe\u2019.The scary part of the Deathly Forest was that players could become lost once they entered the forest. Eventually, the players would mysteriously die one after another. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, there were countless players who had entered the forest and died over and over again in such a way without even meeting the shadow of a monster. If they had good luck and met a monster, then the result was a party-wipe. Only after many experts of Guilds had done it, did everyone finally understand the dreadfulness of the Deathly Forest. They had acknowledged that it was a terrifying Dungeon that was impossible to clear without reaching Level 5.When Shadow Guild reached Level 5, they had organized hundreds of players to scout out the paths in the Deathly Forest. They had paid over hundreds of lives to finally have a clear understanding of the Deathly Forest\u2019s map.The entire Deathly Forest had thirty-six paths. However, only three of them led to the first Boss, Willie. These three paths were paved with the lives of many players. Two of these three paths were extremely dangerous. Without sufficient strength, death would be the only result. There was only one path that had very few monsters.Under Shi Feng\u2019s lead, everyone walked into the forest.The moment they entered the forest, everyone discovered that there were too many pathways through the forest. They did not know which one was the right path. However, Shi Feng had chosen one without hesitation. Everyone else closely followed him while being cautious of their surroundings.After walking for about five minutes, they met their first monster. Suddenly, everybody started to become tense.\u201cDon\u2019t act on impulse. Listen to my commands.\u201d Shi Feng loudly shouted.In front of them was only a Level 2 Elite monster, a Night Rabbit. However, due to the Dungeon\u2019s strengthening, its Attack, Defense, and HP were all greatly increased. Its HP was a whopping 700 points.\u201cCola, you lure the monster over. Oracle, pay attention to healing. Everyone else, don\u2019t start the attack without my command,\u201d Shi Feng quickly gave out orders.The Guardian Knight, Cola gulped down a mouthful of saliva. He carefully walked towards the Night Rabbit\u2019s attack range. Everyone else was nervous to the extreme. Although this was only a Level 2 Elite, they were currently in the Hell Mode of a Dungeon.However, everyone\u2019s nervousness was for naught. The moment the Night Rabbit with a person\u2019s height saw Cola, it immediately dashed over.Cola had very successfully lured the Night Rabbit over. Moreover, he did not panic when he lured it. He retreated while using his shield to block the Night Rabbit\u2019s attacks. However, even though every attack landed on the shield, the damage was still terrifying; just a single hit dealt 42 damage. By the time Cola returned to the front of the party, his HP had already dropped by a third.The Oracle, whose name was Drowsy Sloth, had good awareness. He had given out healing the moment Cola entered his casting range. However, every heal could only add 24 HP to Cola; it was completely not enough to stop Cola\u2019s HP from falling.\u201cBrother Feng, are we still not attacking?\u201d Blackie was slightly nervous. At this moment, Cola\u2019s remaining HP did not even reach one-third of its total.Bringing an Oracle into a Dungeon was just a complete mistake. Amongst the Healer Jobs, Oracles had the weakest healing abilities. However, since Shi Feng had chosen so, Blackie could only acknowledge it. Now that their MT was close to death, it would be unacceptable if they still did not attack.\u201cHold on.\u201d Shi Feng resolutely said.Time passed bit by bit. Cola continuously used his shield to block the claw attacks of the Night Rabbit, whereas his HP continuously decreased. Cola only had 20% HP remaining, yet Shi Feng had yet to give out the command to attack.Just when everyone thought that Shi Feng wanted to give up on Cola, a flying arrow pierced through the forest, shooting directly for the party\u2019s Oracle, Drowsy Sloth. Lonely Snow had not reacted at all as Drowsy Sloth was struck directly on his chest. A very great damage of -123 points appeared.At this moment, Shi Feng shouted, \u201cSloth, use Life Payment. Use the damage you received to heal Cola. Blackie, hold back the Night Rabbit to let Cola recover. Lonely, come with me. Everyone else attacks the Night Rabbit.\u201dOracles were indeed the weakest regarding healing. However, Oracles had high HP; they would not be easily one-shotted. Also, Oracles had two skills when they first start out. One was Life Prayer, while the other was Life Payment. Life Payment could turn the damage received by the user into a heal to be used on other players. In the early periods of the game, healers did not possess many skills or equipment. In regards to such a situation, Oracles had a greater advantage over other healers when entering the Deathly Forest. It was the reason why Shi Feng had given up on choosing a Priest over an Oracle.After finishing his piece, Shi Feng rushed into the forest.\u201cDo you think I will let you run away?\u201d Shi Feng coldly said as he looked at the dark shadow running through the forest.Wind Blade!Shi Feng turned into a phantom, chasing directly forward.The reason why Shi Feng did not let anyone attack the Night Rabbit was to use Cola as bait. Shi Feng wanted to lure out the dark hand hiding behind the scenes.Although the Night Rabbit looked terrifying, an Elite party could face up to two or three of them at once without any problems. However, in Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, the reason why even a Level 5 Elite party could be party-wiped was that of the dark shadow in front of Shi Feng. This dark shadow used the Night Rabbit as bait, luring players into attacking it. The dark shadow, on the other hand, would ambush the healers from behind. As the Night Rabbit was occupying everyone else, there was no way to save the healer. In the end, everyone died.Inside the Deathly Forest, if players did not deal with this fellow, the result would be a party-wipe.With the increased Movement Speed from Wind Blade, Shi Feng quickly caught up to the dark shadow. Shi Feng waved out three sword slashes, sealing the dark shadow\u2019s path of advance.The black shadow knew that it could not escape. It immediately turned around, unsheathing a pair of knives to block Shi Feng\u2019s attack.Dang! Dang! Dang!With the Abyssal Blade, Shi Feng\u2019s Strength was frighteningly high. His attacks caused the dark shadow to take three steps back, and each step it retreated would be followed by the damage that was over -10. In the end, the dark shadow revealed its figure under the moonlight.[Night Ranger] (Special Elite)Level 2HP 1458/1500Seeing the Night Ranger being repelled, Shi Feng immediately used Abyssal bind without giving him a chance. Nine pitch-black chains appeared to bind the Night Ranger, preventing him from moving for 3 seconds, and his Defense reduced by 100%.Thundering Flash!Chop!Damages of -81, -98, -119, -124 appeared. When the two skills landed, a frightening amount of damage appeared, taking away a quarter of the Night Ranger\u2019s HP.No matter how capable the Night Ranger was, it could not break free from the binding of the nine chains. He could only silently take a beating for 3 whole seconds.Shi Feng was unrestrained as he sent out sword slash after sword slash, piercing through the vital point on the Night Ranger\u2019s chest. By the time the Night Ranger broke free from the bindings, his remaining HP did not exceed 700 points.\u201cWretched human!\u201d The Night Ranger was enraged. He brandished his twin blades like a gale, engulfing Shi Feng.At this moment, Lonely Snow finally caught up. A Charge from him had caused the Night Ranger to enter a fainted state, at the same time breaking the Night Ranger\u2019s gale-like blade.Shi Feng took the chance to slash at the Night Ranger\u2019s neck.Lonely Snow also brandished his large ax at the Night Ranger.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBy the time the Night Ranger had awoken, he only had a remnant of his HP left. The Night Ranger abruptly hacked his twin blades towards Lonely Snow, sending him flying backward and dealing 64 damage. The Night Ranger turned his head to stare at Shi Feng, once more brandishing his twin blades and slashing horizontally towards Shi Feng\u2019s neck.Dang! Shi Feng used Parry with his sword. Without giving the Night Ranger any chances to retaliate, Shi Feng lifted up the ranger and tossed him back. Then, Shi Feng followed up with a couple of sword strikes, finishing off the Night Ranger.Shi Feng conveniently picked up the two items that dropped, then immediately ran towards Cola\u2019s location to provide help.Laying by the side, Lonely Snow became dumbfounded after seeing Shi Feng\u2019s agile skills. His heart filled with shock, Lonely Snow had even forgotten to follow Shi Feng to support.There was such a way even to kill monsters?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26 \u2013 Miraculous TechniqueBy the time Shi Feng returned to the party, the Elite Night Rabbit only had one-third of its HP remaining.Everyone had coordinated properly; Cola tanked in the front alone, while the others vigorously dealt damage. However, to control aggro, Blackie did not madly deal damage. Instead, he used Evil Whip to pin down the Night Rabbit, giving Cola some breathing space. Cola\u2019s performance was also very good. He steadily tanked the monster, and he also had good control over aggro. Cola was not at the level of a novice, but there was still a long road ahead before he became an expert.\u201cCola, don\u2019t always try to block with your shield. It isn\u2019t a must to block an attack like the other virtual reality games. You can also dodge to avoid an attack. That way, you could reduce the stress on the healer. For everyone else, focus your attacks on the target. Don\u2019t just randomly attack, aim your attacks at the wild rabbit\u2019s claws or other weak points. That way, you can reduce a lot of burden on the MT.\u201d Shi Feng did not directly go up to help Cola, but instead, he taught everyone how to battle against monsters.If everyone battled while regarding God\u2019s Domain as a traditional game, the results would be disastrous. This was because the healing given out was usually far from being able to keep up with the damage received. Some parties would bring an extra healer. However, this would result in the damage being insufficient; the result was still a party-wipe. Players only slowly got used to the combat style in God\u2019s Domain several months after the game opened. The players then would no longer be as cute and simple as they were now.Shi Feng wanted to cultivate everyone to build a foundation for his future Workshop. So naturally, he needed to let these people learn the combat styles of God\u2019s Domain earlier.Everyone thought Shi Feng was also a noob, so they held slight dissatisfaction within their hearts. The expert did not say anything, so why was a noob like him giving out commands? However, Shi Feng\u2019s words made sense, so they still consciously did as Shi Feng said.Cola had also started to change his battle style. He was no longer using his shield to block the attacks rigidly. Instead, he retreated a step back when the wild rabbit launched its attack, taking the chance to avoid it. Although Cola still needed to use his shield to block most of the time, it had still greatly reduced the burden on the healer.Such a change allowed killing the Night Rabbit to become even easier.The few Level 1 noobs were also slightly surprised. There was some change in their opinions towards Shi Feng. Shi Feng was not as unbearable as they had imagined him to be.Shi Feng only smiled at this situation. He did not mind their thoughts at all. Shi Feng only felt that Cola was quite good after seeing his performance.Although Cola was a first-rate expert ten years later, he currently was still far from that point. If it were an expert MT, they would not retreat, but choose to dodge the attack without even moving. Such a decision was because if the MT moved, the monster would move as well. This situation would cause trouble for long-ranged damage dealers, which would result in the loss of a lot of damage. However, such a technique required a bounty of experience in battle and a body with dexterous reactions. Cola still needed a lot of training.The Elite Night Rabbit fell within a moment. It dropped a skill book for Berserkers, [Whirlwind Slash]. It also dropped three Coppers.Everyone could not help but be amazed by the drop rate of Hell Mode. A skill book dropped just after they killed an Elite monster. If they killed over ten Elite monsters, then wouldn\u2019t they be able to obtain over ten skill books? It should be known that skill books were extremely rare, and even a Common skill could sell for 1 Silver.Shi Feng naturally knew of their thoughts. However, not even Hell Mode had that high of a drop rate. It was only three to four times that of Hard Mode. Afterward, Shi Feng passed Whirlwind Slash to the stupefied Lonely Snow; then he passed a Level 1 Bronze Defensive Plate Armor to Cola; the Night Ranger dropped the armor. With these items, the party\u2019s strength slightly increased.Cola\u2019s mouth could not close after receiving the Defensive Plate Armor. He hurriedly thanked Shi Feng for it. With this Bronze Plate Armor, not only had Cola\u2019s Defense increased by 14 points, but his HP had also become 350 points.Aside from Shi Feng and Blackie, everyone else on the scene was filled with envy. Bronze Equipment was the identification of an expert. Outside the Dungeon, it was impossible to obtain a piece of Bronze Equipment, even if you begged for it. And this piece of equipment was obtained by Shi Feng, alone. Yet, Shi Feng gave it to Cola without hesitation. Everyone\u2019s opinion towards Shi Feng changed quite a bit. They felt such a party leader was not bad at all. Shi Feng was unlike the other party leaders who would prioritize themselves when equipment dropped. As for Bronze Equipment, forget giving it away to a temporary party member; they would definitely keep it for themselves.Afterward, everyone followed Shi Feng as they advanced.Although the dark and gloomy forest was scary, everyone was no longer as nervous as they were before going through a stimulating fight.From time to time, one or two patrolling Elite Night Rabbits would appear in front of them, and they would also respond to it quickly. When there were two Night Rabbits, Cola would tank one of them, while Shi Feng and Lonely Snow would rush over and kill the other. As for the ranged players, they would prioritize attacking the Night Rabbit in front of Shi Feng.The Night Rabbit\u2019s 700 HP would be gone quickly under the fierce bombardment.Afterward, the party supported Cola and finished off the other Night Rabbit. Within moments, two Night Rabbits were no more. With this process, a skill book, [Restore], meant for healers also dropped. The skill had a 2 second cast time. When learned by Oracles, the skill could instantly restore 37 HP. It was far better than Life Prayer. It did not share the same Cooldown as Life Prayer, so the two could be used in coordination to negate the damage caused by the Elite Night Rabbits completely.Drowsy Sloth continuously thanked Shi Feng and the other party members for letting him learn the skill book. Restore was an extremely important skill for conquering Dungeons. If it were to be sold outside, it could go for at least 2 or 3 Silver coins.\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. Skill books are meant to be used. Let\u2019s continue onward.\u201d Shi Feng smiled as he answered.Aside from AoE attack skill books, healer-class skill books were the most expensive and rare. However, the Deathly Forest was a Dungeon meant to let players build up their foundation in God\u2019s Domain. In Hell Mode, the drop rate for basic healing skills was very high. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, he had obtained four healing skill books just after entering Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest once. It was not considered valuable.After more than an hour, Shi Feng\u2019s party arrived at a flat grassland. They had finally met the first Boss of the Dungeon.[Willie] (Chieftain-rank)Level 3HP 6000Willie was a ferocious Night Rabbit. Its height was as tall as two people, and sharp steel claws decorated its paws. These claws loved creating a feast of fresh blood, and those caught by it would be ripped to shreds, turned into a river of blood. It was unknown how many players had died a gruesome death under these claws.A short distance away from Willie, there were seven Elite Night Rabbits on guard. These seven rabbits were very close to each other. As long as one of them was attacked, the other wild rabbits would rush over as well. There was also a great possibility of attracting the Boss.Even if it were Shi Feng, he would not be able to face off against seven Night Rabbits, not to mention including a Boss.However, if they did not finish off the seven Night Rabbits, there was no way for them to attack the Boss.\u201cBrother Feng, what should we do now? This place has too many Night Rabbits. The game isn\u2019t giving us any chances.\u201d Blackie was very anxious. Although the Boss was in front of them, the System had dealt them such a hand. This difficulty was just too great. No wonder it was a Hell Mode dungeon. It was impossible to pass through without absolute strength.The System\u2019s setting also angered everyone. Who could fend off seven Elite Night Rabbits? Even a Level 5 Guardian Knight would not be able to do it.\u201cYou all wait for me behind that rock. Cola, get ready to receive the monster. Everyone else is not allowed to attack without my command,\u201d Shi Feng pointed towards a large rock nearby; Shi Feng naturally knew that there were seven Elite Night Rabbits here.Everyone abided by Shi Feng\u2019s command without question. All the monsters they had killed on the way here relied on Shi Feng\u2019s commands for success. They killed quite a lot of Night Rabbits, and everyone had obtained one or two pieces of Bronze Equipment. Blackie even had five pieces of Bronze Equipment. Their party\u2019s strength has definitely surpassed the other elite parties. The credit for such an achievement belonged to Shi Feng\u2019s commands.As for Shi Feng, he had run to a location that was 40 yards away from the seven Night Rabbits. He quietly hid within the bushes, observing the Night Rabbits\u2019 every movement.Everyone understood that Shi Feng was trying to lure monsters. However, the seven Night Rabbits were too close to each other. Shi Feng was a Swordsman. He did not possess any long-ranged attacking capabilities, so how could he lure monsters?Time passed bit by bit. Everyone was extremely anxious. If Shi Feng accidentally failed, then it would be a party-wipe. However, Shi Feng was calm. He moved not an inch as he watched the faraway Night Rabbits.At this moment, a cool breeze blew past. A dead leaf on the trees was sent flying over.Seeing the dead leaf hovering down towards the Night Rabbit, Shi Feng picked up a small stone beside him. Gently, he tossed the stone over.The direction the stone flew to was towards the Night Rabbit closest to the Boss.\u201cWe\u2019re finished.\u201dEveryone understood what kind of outcome this would be. It would definitely be a combination of one Boss and seven Night Rabbits rushing towards them, turning them into blood sacrifices.The moment the stone was about to hit the Night Rabbit, the dead leaf just happened to have blocked between the stone and the Night Rabbit.The stone struck the dead leaf, smashing it onto the Night Rabbit.The Night Rabbit abruptly turned to look at its surroundings, only discovering a leaf. However, how could a leaf hitting it be so painful? Subsequently, the Night Rabbit left its unit to observe the surroundings. It looked around aimlessly, not knowing what it was trying to find. It had unknowingly moved over 20 yards away from its unit, and it was still moving further and further away.\u201cToo godly!\u201d Lonely Snow could not help but exclaim; his eyes had nearly popped out of their sockets.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEveryone else had dumbly nodded as well.What kind of accurate judgment and aim was required to hit the dead leaf while hitting the Night Rabbit, and thereby confusing the Night Rabbit\u2019s hatred, causing it to look for its target blindly?Even calling it as an ultimate skill was not excessive.Was Shi Feng really a noob? He couldn\u2019t be some gaming god here to make a fool of them, right?\u201cSummoner, the rest is up to you.\u201d Shi Feng walked to the rock\u2019s location. He looked at the Summoner, clapping the person\u2019s shoulders as he spoke, smiling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He did not understand what Shi Feng wanted him to do. If he had performed badly and was kicked from the party as a result, he would regret it until he died.It was hard to find a good party during this time, not to mention a party with an expert leading it. It was impossible to join such a party, even if you begged!\u201cRelax, I won\u2019t let you do anything dangerous. You just have to summon out a Flame Sprite and follow my instructions. You don\u2019t have to do anything else,\u201d Shi Feng said with a smile, trying ease the nerves of Gluttonous Mouse a little.Currently, Summoners were not strong; mainly due to the incapability of their skills. A Summoner\u2019s method of attack mainly relied on their summoned creatures, whereas their normal attack was the low-damage Magic Bullet. However, a Summoner with awesome skills could become a one-man army. It was especially true for Summoners who could call out powerful elemental creatures. They could kill Elite monsters as if they were just playing around.\u201cParty leader, rest assured, I\u2019ll definitely do it.\u201d Gluttonous Mouse loudly said, his tone filled with respect. He was like a student who had met his teacher.\u201cEveryone else, distance yourselves from that rock, twenty yards away from it would be the best. Pay attention not to lure the other monsters.\u201d Sh Feng turned around and said to the other party members.\u201cYes, party leader!\u201dThe other party members loudly replied. Their current attitudes were completely different from before.Shi Feng was slightly shocked by everyone\u2019s performance. Why was each and every one of them so obedient all of a sudden?However, Shi Feng did not know that the single stone he threw just now had completely shocked every one of them.They were filled with admiration towards Shi Feng\u2019s stone-throwing technique. Such skill and accuracy were definitely not something a normal person could do; professional players might not even be able to do so.Worshipping the strong was a common sight within a game. These Level 1 noobs were no exception.At this moment, the gaze everyone used to look at Shi Feng was completely different. Before, they merely felt that Shi Feng was a good commander. Now, however, Shi Feng was a strong person they worshipped. They had faintly grown a sense of reverence for Shi Feng.Standing to the side, Blackie clapped Lonely Snow\u2019s shoulders, proudly saying, \u201cHow is it? Following Brother Feng isn\u2019t bad, right?\u201dLonely Snow silently nodded his head, rejoicing for the decision he made to follow after Shi Feng. Shi Feng was definitely a Beta Tester expert. Without sufficient experience and practice, such techniques were impossible to accomplish. Only a Beta Tester could possibly do it.\u201cHahaha! What do you plan to do in the future?\u201d Blackie suddenly asked. He started to hatch ideas towards Lonely Snow. Blackie wanted to poach Lonely Snow for their Workshop, even though the Workshop was still non-existent. There was a 100% chance for Cola to join them, but Lonely Snow still did not have any plans to move in such a direction.\u201cThe future?\u201d Lonely Snow had never considered it before. He was but an average player. He did not have any big ambitions, only wanting to earn some cash from playing games. He said honestly, \u201cI have never considered it before.\u201d\u201cI see that your techniques are quite good. Why don\u2019t you join us for now?\u201d Blackie nonchalantly asked.\u201cReally?\u201d Lonely Snow had anxiety about his future after Blackie\u2019s question. He did not know where he wanted to go. If he could party with an expert, then it could not get any better.\u201cOf course. However, we still need to look at your future performance. We don\u2019t just simply accept people,\u201d Blackie proudly said, pretending to be an expert.\u201cThank you, Brother Black.\u201d Lonely Snow happily responded. He never imagined his luck would be so great as to be noticed by an expert.Seeing Lonely Snow agree, Blackie released a sigh of relief. Currently, Blackie was just a fox pretending to be a tiger. He couldn\u2019t help out Shi Feng much in God\u2019s Domain, but he could still help out in regards to administration.There wasn\u2019t even a shadow of their Workshop as of this moment. There was also the debt of 16,000 Credits. The Workshop\u2019s members consisted of only Shi Feng and himself. It was definitely the poorest Workshop in history. If this was found out by the others, they would definitely turn around and leave. Now, Blackie could only fake being an expert to lure people to join their Workshop.At this moment, Shi Feng was currently explaining the contents of the operation to the Summoner. The operation was to let Gluttonous Mouse lure the remaining six Night Rabbits by controlling his Flame Sprite. Because the Night Rabbit that was closest to the Boss was no more, luring the other Night Rabbits would not attract the Boss. They could lure the monsters with ease.The Flame Sprite was extremely weak. Its HP was only a pitiful 15 points, and it would die in a single hit. However, its Movement Speed was extremely quick. Adding to its very small size, trying to hit it would be a difficult task.\u201cStart the operation. Mouse, remember to maintain a distance of 4 yards or above while circling around the rock,\u201d Shi Feng reminded once more.Gluttonous Mouse nodded his head. Carefully, he controlled the Flame Sprite to lure the six Night Rabbits. When the sprite entered the 35-yard distance, the nearest Elite Night Rabbit discovered the Flame Sprite. Suddenly, it turned its body around and rushed towards the Flame Sprite. The other Night Rabbits also came rushing along.Seeing the Night Rabbits taking the bait, Gluttonous Mouse immediately controlled the Flame Sprite and ran. The six Night Rabbits were in hot pursuit, but their speed could no match for the Flame Sprite. In a moment, the Flame Sprite had arrived beneath the large rock. It had lured the six Night Rabbits over and started circling around the large rock.On the other side, Cola had already aggroed the Night Rabbit that had left its unit. Cola interchanged between blocking and using his new skill, [Divine Strike]. With the effects of two pieces of Bronze Equipment, a single hit from Divine Strike had caused 26 damage. It was a lot higher compared to the 11 or 12 damage caused by a normal strike. Also, Divine Strike had the added effect of increasing Hatred. It became a lot easier to hold aggro.The Night Rabbit was killed off within a short moment. It dropped 5 Coppers.After this Night Rabbit was handled, only the six Night Rabbits that kept on circling around the large rock remained.\u201cI\u2019ll lure the Night Rabbits. Cola, pay attention to pull the monster.\u201d Shi Feng picked up another small stone, throwing it at the Night Rabbit that ran at the rear.The Night Rabbit rubbed its cranium after being struck on it. The rabbit turned around, discovering Shi Feng that had thrown the stone. The Night Rabbit suddenly became enraged. It madly hopped towards Shi Feng with its powerful legs. As for the other Night Rabbits, they were still excitedly chasing after the Flame Sprite, failing to notice the disappearance of one of their companions.\u201cReceive it!\u201d Seeing the Night Rabbit was only 20 yards away from the party, Shi Feng commanded.Cola rushed ahead, sending a Divine Strike towards the Night Rabbit\u2019s head.The Night Rabbit\u2019s target immediately changed, extending its claws towards Cola\u2019s cranium. However, Cola had reacted quickly by dodging his body sideways. After avoiding the attack, Cola continued by using [Punishment]. The skill had once more strengthened the Night Rabbit\u2019s Hatred to Cola.\u201cEveryone, focus fire.\u201dShi Feng inwardly applauded after seeing Cola\u2019s performance. He had never imagined Cola\u2019s ability to learn would be this great. He had already found out about the Night Rabbit\u2019s attack patterns after going through slightly more than ten battles. No wonder he was the core MT of a first-rate Guild, ten years later. His potential was limitless.The Night Rabbit in front of Cola had fallen within 20 seconds. It had even dropped a skill book for Swordsman, [Double Chop].Shi Feng immediately learned it without reservations.[Double Chop] (Action-type)Requires: SwordLevel 1Proficiency 0/300Rapidly deals damage twice. Every slash of the sword deals 120% +15 damage, also increasing Bleeding effect by 20%. Duration of 10 seconds.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euStacks up to a maximum of 5 times.Cooldown: 8 secondsThis skill book had greatly increased Shi Feng\u2019s explosive power. As for the problem of getting used to the skill, it was non-existent for Shi Feng. After playing for ten years as a Swordsman, the skills belonging to the Job were deeply ingrained into Shi Feng\u2019s bones. As long as Shi Feng got ahold of these skills, he would be able to utilize them to their greatest potential.Shi Feng had also lured the remaining five Night Rabbits over, one after another. The party had killed the rabbits one by one, and following the death of the final Night Rabbit, a golden glow appeared around Shi Feng\u2019s body; he had risen to Level 2.At the same time, the five Night Rabbits had contributed to the party a piece of Bronze Plate Armor for Guardian Knights. The equipment increased Cola\u2019s HP to 390 points and his Defense to 56. It had also increased Cola\u2019s ability to resist against the Night Rabbit Chieftain, Willie.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28 \u2013 The Horror Of Hell ModeWith the Elites that were on guard all dead, only the Boss, Willie, remained on the open field. At this moment, Willie was laying on the ground, sleeping. It would scratch its back from time to time, completely unaware of its missing henchmen.\u201cEveryone, recover for now. I\u2019ll explain the method to raid Willie in a moment.\u201d Shi Feng wanted everyone to ease up first. It would not be easy to face off against Willie. The fight would require a high degree of concentration because a single mistake would cause everyone to be buried together.Hearing Shi Feng\u2019s command, everyone sat down to recuperate. They ate and drank to recover to their best state.Shi Feng\u2019s finger waved and shook as he called up his Attribute Panel.He had recently reached Level 2. Because of the Abyssal Blade, the Free Attribute Points he obtained exceeded other players by 2 points. The choices he could make with his points were slightly more than the average player.In the initial period, it was sufficient for the Agility of a Swordsman to reach 20 points. However, Shi Feng increased his to 30 points. There would be a fixed increase in the body\u2019s flexibility when Agility reached 30 points. Subsequently, Shi Feng added the remaining points into Strength, making it easier for him to contend with the Boss.Shi Feng had on him three pieces of Bronze Equipment, a Mysterious-Iron Ring, and a Magic Weapon. Shi Feng Attributes had basically reached his own requirements.Character: Ye Feng (Human)Affiliated Kingdom: Star-MoonTitle: Might Of A ThousandJob: SwordsmanLevel: 2HP: 520/520Attack Power: 88Defense Power: 39Attack Speed: 15Movement Speed: 13Attributes: Strength 32, Agility 30, Endurance 24, Intelligence 13, Vitality 13.With such Attributes, Shi Feng had more confidence dealing with Willie.Seeing everyone recovered, Shi Feng started explaining, \u201cWillie has two skills. One of them is Killing Feast. When used, Willie will ignore Hatred and randomly attack the nearest players. Blackie and Lonely, you two have to pay attention to your positioning. The other skill is Death Claws. Cola, you have to distance yourself from the Boss before this skill is used. Lonely Snow, pay attention to interrupt the Boss. I\u2019ll remind you when the time comes. Another point to take note of, Willie is very smart, so don\u2019t keep on using the same attack pattern. Alright, that\u2019s it. If we\u2019re ready, then start the battle, Cola.\u201d\u201cBrother Feng, is there nothing else we have to pay attention to?\u201d Blackie walked up to Shi Feng\u2019s side, whispering.This place was the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest. Not everyone was an expert, as well. However, Shi Feng\u2019s explanation was so simple that it made them feel conquering this Boss was very easy. However, there were so many Elite parties which had died inside Normal Mode, so how could Hell Mode be so simple?\u201cParty leader, are there no details we need to pay attention to?\u201dEveryone was very worried. They all held anticipation in their gazes as they looked towards Shi Feng, hoping that he would speak more about the finer details. They were noobs, so there were a lot of things they did not understand. In regards to an expert like Shi Feng, the things he felt were common knowledge, were definitely not common to noobs like them.Elites could not be compared to a Boss. The other Elite parties must have definitely died at the hands of the Boss. Although their equipment was better than an Elite party\u2019s, they were still Level 1 noobs. They clearly knew their own worth.\u201cYou guys worry too much. Relax. When the time comes, I\u2019ll tell you what you should do and when you should do it, so don\u2019t worry about it. Cola, start the fight and remember to dodge more often. A single healer will not be able to match up to the Boss\u2019 damage,\u201d Shi Feng smiled. He felt his party members were quite interesting. They were much more serious about the details than he had thought. In his previous life, Shi Feng had entered Hell Mode Dungeons countless times as the Captain of Shadow. There was also no lack of hundred-men Dungeons amongst those times. So, how could he not know how to guide a few noobs to beat a small Boss?Cola had no choice but to go at it hard.Willie abruptly leaped up the moment Cola entered its detection range. Its mouth salivated when it saw Cola, and its two pairs of steel claws intertwined to produce sparks. Cola had clearly stimulated Willie\u2019s heart of massacre. It lifted its steel claws and hastily dashed towards Cola.\u201cStart casting heals. All damage dealers prepare to attack Willie\u2019s limbs.\u201d Shi Feng commanded when he saw Willie\u2019s menacing appearance.Just when Shi Feng finished speaking, Willie had arrived before of Cola. Before Cola could react, its sharp claws had fallen from the sky, slashing at Cola\u2019s neck.Peng! Cola instinctively used his shield to block the steel claws, forming three brilliant streaks of sparks. There were also three claw marks left on the shield. Due to the immense rushing force, Cola was forced to retreat five or six steps as he stabilized his body. Above his head, a damage of -103 appeared.Before Cola could even attack, Willie once again waved out its steel. This time, Cola was sent flying with his shield, and a damage of -105 points appeared. Only at this moment did the heal land on Cola, recovering 43 HP for him. It was a truly insignificant amount when compared to the damage Cola received.Everyone was shocked. The Movement Speed and damage of the Boss was too horrifying. If Cola did not possess two pieces of Bronze Equipment, or if he did not block the attacks with his shield, he would have simply died from these two strikes.\u201cLonely Snow, use Charge on Willie! Blackie, use Evil Whip!\u201d Shi Feng had long since expected such a situation. He quickly instructed Blackie to use a binding skill.Lonely Snow reacted by using a Charge to block Willie\u2019s next attack and saved Cola\u2019s life.However, Lonely Snow\u2019s attack had only caused -11 damage to Willie. He became dumbfounded by it. He had added most of his Attribute Points into Strength, and he even had two pieces of Bronze Equipment on him. Yet, he had dealt such a small amount of damage. It should be known that the Boss in front of him had 6000 HP.Blackie also finished chanting from the side, sending out his Evil Whip.Five streaks of pitch-black thorns suddenly constricted Willie\u2019s legs.Shi Feng took the chance to circle around to Willie\u2019s rear. With the Abyssal Blade in hand, he used Double Chop on Willie\u2019s neck, causing -66 and -67 damage. His attack also caused a Bleeding effect, causing Willie to lose 8 HP every second, lasting for 10 seconds.The high damage immediately caused Willie to switch its Hatred to Shi Feng. However, Shi Feng did not give it any chance. With his 30 Agility, Shi Feng easily dodged away from the steel claws, appearing 5 yards away from Willie.\u201cAo! Ao! Ao!\u201d Willie furiously bellowed as it rushed at Shi Feng.\u201cRanged players start attacking. Cola, come over and hold Willie after you\u2019re done recovering.\u201d Shi Feng systematically retreated while he dodged Willie\u2019s claws.However, the others watching Shi Feng were shocked to their souls. This was because Willie\u2019s claws would graze by Shi Feng\u2019s cranium every time it attacked, blowing his hair into a dance.Although everyone was shocked, they never stopped attacking. Magic attacks were sent out one after another, whereas Lonely Snow used Whirlwind Slash at Willie\u2019s rear. However, not one of those damages had exceeded -20 points.Willie\u2019s HP slowly decreased. When it was occasionally struck by Shi Feng, its HP would drop by a segment.Willie\u2019s HP had fallen to 90% within a moment. Willie became enraged as it started a mad dance with its claws. It used Death Claws, greatly increasing its Attack Speed.Shi Feng was nearly hit by it. Fortunately, however, he had used the Abyssal Blade to block the attack, only receiving -130 damage from it.At this moment, the Cola rushed up with his full HP. He used a Divine Strike on Willie\u2019s head, followed by a Punishment. Willie\u2019s Hatred only switched to Cola after a series of attacks.The switching of Hatred had also interrupted Willie\u2019s Death Claws, returning Willie to its normal state.Seeing Willie change targets, Shi Feng waved out a Thundering Flash. Three streaks of thunder passed through Willie\u2019s body, dealing -92, -116, -137 damage. At the same time, giving Willie a damage amplification effect, it allowed others to deal 20% more damage to it. The fight with Willie became much easier.Blackie was sending out Dark Arrows without stopping, each dealing over -50 damage. Whereas the others only managed to deal over -20 damage to Willie.Being given a painful beating, Willie was just about to turn around and attack Shi Feng when Cola used both Divine Strike and Punishment once more. Willie\u2019s Hatred was quickly pulled back to Cola.When Willie turned back to Cola, Shi Feng used a Chop on it.In such a way, Shi Feng and Cola took turns aggroing Willie, causing it unable to attack any players.Willie\u2019s HP continuously dropped until it was 30%. Willie entered a berserk state, its body increasing by several sizes.\u201cMelee players stay away from the Boss! Blackie, use Evil Whip! Healer, heal me!\u201d Shi Feng loudly shouted. In its current state, Willie was definitely going to use its big move, Killing Feast.Lonely Snow and Cola immediately distanced themselves from the Boss after hearing Shi Feng\u2019s command, letting Shi Feng tank the Boss by himself.When the two of them had run out of the 10-yard range, Willie disappeared.No one understood what happened.When Willie reappeared, it had already arrived at Shi Feng\u2019s back, and its steel claws abruptly descended. Shi Feng had long since been ready for this. He used his sword to block the incoming claws. However, just after blocking this attack, Willie once again disappeared and again appeared behind Shi Feng.Within two short seconds, Willie had attacked Shi Feng\u2019s back seven times. Fortunately, Shi Feng\u2019s Agility had reached 30 points. It was barely enough to match up to Willie\u2019s speed. However, every attack Shi Feng blocked would still take away a significant amount of HP from him. The heals he received also continuously recovered his HP.-96, -97, +46, -96, -97, +48, +32, -96, -97, +46\u2026\u2026If Shi Feng did not possess 520 HP and blocked every claw that came at him, Shi Feng would have died from Willie\u2019s Killing Feast with 100% certainty.At this moment, Shi Feng\u2019s remaining HP did not reach 100 points.\u201cGet rid of it!\u201d Shi Feng loudly shouted.After using his big move, Willie would enter a Weakened state. It was the perfect chance to kill it.Everyone continuously greeted Willie with their attacks, finally shaving off Willie\u2019s remaining 30% HP. It dropped four items.Just as everyone was about to let loose their breaths, Shi Feng took a look at everyone\u2019s current status. The healer, Drowsy Sloth\u2019s remaining MP did not reach 20%, and the other mages\u2019 MP did not reach 10%. Shi Feng hurriedly said, \u201cEveryone, sit down and recover immediately!\u201dEveryone was confused. Didn\u2019t the Boss just die? Why must they be in such a hurry? However, everyone still listened to Shi Feng\u2019s command to sit down and recover.Before they had even sat down and recuperated with food and drinks for five seconds, a violent roar entered everyone\u2019s ears. The roar had shaken the entire Deathly Forest, and following it, a black shadow leaped out from within the forest.The black shadow was a gigantic Werewolf. The Werewolf looked at Willie\u2019s corpse, then looked towards Shi Feng and the others. It\u2019s pitch-black eyes suddenly turned crimson red. Just when it wanted to release a roar, Shi Feng dashed towards it with Wind Blade. Immediately, Shi Feng used Abyssal Bind. Nine chains appeared and bound the Werewolf and its mouth, preventing it from making a sound.At this moment, everyone finally saw the Werewolf\u2019s statistics. It had a whopping two bars of HP.[Werewolf Felt] (Lord-rank)Level 3Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHP 12000/12000\u201cCrap, why is there a Lord Boss?\u201d Blackie cursed.They had barely rested just after killing a Boss, and now there was a Lord in front of them. Lords were a rank higher than Chieftains. The game was literally trying to kill them.\u201cEveryone remember, absolutely do not let Werewolf Felt let out another roar.\u201d Shi Feng continuously reminded everyone.However, the others were clearly frightened. Not because of Werewolf Felt\u2019s body and HP, but because of that pair of horrifying crimson eyes. They gave off an intimidating feeling to everyone that made it hard to move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29 \u2013 Extraordinary StateIn front of the Dungeon of the Deathly Forest, the numbers of Level 2 players gathering were increasing. There was also an endless stream of players diving down into the Dungeon.Because there were a lot of Level 2 players, there was quite an amount of players who had set up stalls, peddling to the side.\u201cGood quality Level 0 Common Equipment, don\u2019t miss it when you pass by. You can only go down the Dungeon with good equipment. Equipment is limited, hurry over and buy.\u201d\u201cSmall HP Potions instantly heals 90 HP once. A must-have tool for a battle that is worthy of you.\u201dGod\u2019s Domain had been open for over ten hours now. The players here were all Level 2 players. After over ten hours of battling, they had gathered quite a few items. Many Level 2 players had intended to sell the items which they had no use for, switching them for something they could use. Such a situation had caused business to flourish at the Deathly Forest.Although the number of players in front of the Deathly Forest continued to increase, the number of parties entering the Dungeon kept on decreasing. Only those parties that were unaware would enter the Deathly Forest.However, after those players had been properly nurtured by the Deathly Forest, they suddenly discovered their previous beliefs to be very naive. Hence, they obediently stood in front of the Dungeon. They talked about life with other parties while watching new parties enter the Dungeon with a smile. They had also investigated reports of the Deathly Forest together with the experienced parties, mutually improving their strategies to conquer the Dungeon.Following wave after wave of players entering and dying out of the Dungeon, the Deathly Forest had finally become the sore point of every player in Red Leaf Town.Every player who entered the Deathly Forest only had one impression of the Dungeon.It was extremely horrifying!Currently, in the Resurrection Graveyard of the Deathly Forest, six streaks of white light flashed into existence. Following which, six figures revealed themselves from within.\u201cThere is just no way to clear this Dungeon. Snow, I think we would be better off grinding monsters or doing Quests.\u201d Just after reviving, Zhao Yueru stamped her delicate feet, her chest heaving up and down. The cuteness of her enraged, yet delicate appearance instantly attracted the attention of a crowd of male players.Gentle Snow shook her head, saying in contemplation, \u201cOur gains inside the Deathly Forest are relatively good, so we can\u2019t just easily give up. But the forest inside the Deathly Forest is too large. Adding in the great number of small paths, we would easily become lost without a map. However, I believe that amongst the numerous pathways, there must be a few that lead to the Boss\u2019 location. The other paths are only there as a trap to confuse us. That is why we are always being ambushed by the Night Rabbits. The more we fight, the more Night Rabbits will come. For now, let\u2019s investigate for some information and see if we can complete a map for the Deathly Forest.\u201dEveryone felt that Gentle Snow\u2019s speculation made sense, especially about the part where they attacked the Night Rabbits. Occasionally, a chilling arrow aimed at the Cleric, Xiao Yue\u2019er, would appear from within the forest. If it wasn\u2019t for Xiao Yue\u2019er\u2019s skill at dodging, they would have long since party-wiped.Also, the deeper they went into the forest, the more numerous the Night Rabbits became. In the end, the Night Rabbits became too overwhelming in numbers. They were unable to shoulder all of the rabbits, which resulted in their return through death. If they could find the correct path, they might have already cleared the Dungeon by now.Zhao Yueru could only nod her head in agreement. The party\u2019s leader was, in fact, Gentle Snow, and Gentle Snow\u2019s speculations were always very accurate. Zhao Yueru could not help but believe in her.Going with the suggestion, Gentle Snow and Zhao Yueru nonchalantly shouted a few times, stating that they wanted to trade information about the Deathly Forest.It couldn\u2019t be denied, the striking effect created by two great beauties calling out. Suddenly, the atmosphere in the Deathly Forest started to boil as players rushed over, one after another. Every one of them wanted to be the first in position.Too many of the male players, this was a great chance for them to talk to a Goddess. Who knew, if the Goddess had looked upon them they might be able to live a \u2018blessed\u2019 life in the future.Meanwhile, inside the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest. The sky within the Dungeon had already darkened. Thousands of birds soared to the skies, leaving the forest in a deadly silence.Werewolf Felt was not any common monster. It was a very famous werewolf. In the past, it massacred countless in Red Leaf Town, nearly turning Red Leaf Town into a town of death. In a fit of rage, the Star-Moon Kingdom had sent out its army to surround Felt. In the end, after being heavily wounded by the Great Swordmaster, Hilton, Felt had escaped into the Deathly Forest to treat its wounds. It was the reason why the Dungeon of the Deathly Forest existed.In Hell Mode, Felt had three absolute skills. The first one was [Death Stare]. Enemies who Felt stared at would have their Attack Speed and Movement Speed greatly reduced. If one had a weak willpower, they might not even be able to move.Presently, only Shi Feng had 30 points in Agility. After he had activated the three Hidden Basic Skills he possessed, he gained a certain amount of resistance towards the Death Stare. As for the other people, their reactions would become very sluggish.That was why Shi Feng remained the one to keep Werewolf Felt in check, whereas Drowsy Sloth continuously healed Shi Feng. However, Drowsy Sloth\u2019s casting speed had slowed by half. As for the melee players, they were no help whatsoever. However, it was not because they did not want to help, but it was because they had no way of helping at all. Werewolf Felt\u2019s Attack Speed was just too fast. It was to the degree where they couldn\u2019t react to its attacks. It was as if they were facing off against an expert that came straight out from a Wuxia novel; normal people had no chance to interfere whatsoever.They would only be creating more trouble if they had rushed up to the battle. So, it was still better to just watch from the side.Currently, only the ranged mages dealt damage. However, the damage caused was just too low. Even Blackie\u2019s Dark Arrows were only dealing -24 damage each.\u201cLonely, interrupt the roar!\u201d Seeing Felt abruptly inhaling, Shi Feng immediately shouted.Lonely Snow had long since prepared for this moment. Immediately, he went forward and used Charge, causing Felt to enter a 1 second Fainted state. Then, he quickly retreated.Shi Feng took the chance to use Thundering Flash, Double Chop, and Chop. One attack after another landed on Felt\u2019s chest. Before Felt could even regain its breath, it had spat out a mouthful of blood. Shi Feng had caused a terrifying -500 damage to it.Within an instant, Felt\u2019s HP had fallen to 78%.Everyone watching became dumbfounded. Regarding Shi Feng\u2019s powerful actions, they only had one word to say: Amazing! They were even more impressed by Shi Feng\u2019s eyesight. He had actually discovered such a weakness on Felt\u2019s body. Now, everyone was further reassured that Shi Feng was not as simple as he seemed.However, Shi Feng did not display any great excitement. Although they had interrupted Hell\u2019s Roar and avoided a party-wipe, this would create a reverse effect.After spitting out a mouthful of blood, Werewolf Felt\u2019s condition became much more pleasant. It spun its head around and immediately slashed its sharp claws at Shi Feng. The slashing speed of Felt\u2019s claws was even a notch quicker than before, filling the sky with the afterimages of its claws.However, Shi Feng was not a weakling either. Strength, Agility, and Endurance, Shi Feng activated the Hidden Basic Skills of all three of these Attributes. With these skills activated, it meant that Shi Feng\u2019s constitution was no longer that of an average player, but an extraordinary one. Shi Feng\u2019s greatest asset in coming into the Deathly Forest was this Extraordinary State which he could activate at any given moment. With it, he could do things that normal players couldn\u2019t.Under a sky filled with after images of claws, Shi Feng could still remain safe and sound. It was as if Shi Feng was dancing under the afterimages. Occasionally, Shi Feng used his sword to fend off the attacks which he could not avoid. This was the power of being under an extraordinary condition. His five senses became extremely sensitive, and his brain\u2019s processing abilities became exceptionally focused. Shi Feng could utilize his body to its greatest potential. If it was an average player, however, they would be unable to carry out such feats. It was both mentally and physically taxing to the extraordinary condition. If Shi Feng had not become accustomed to it before, he would only be able to maintain such a state for a few seconds.Claws and sword intertwined, creating countless dazzling sparks.Both sides had their HP continuously falling. Fortunately, Shi Feng was able to survive the exchange with Drowsy Sloth\u2019s timely heals.Afterward, under Shi Feng\u2019s command, Lonely Snow would occasionally interrupt the Hell\u2019s Roar, while Cola would hold back Felt whenever Shi Feng was in danger, and Blackie would use Evil Whip to contain Felt\u2019s movements. In such a way, Werewolf Felt\u2019s HP continuously decreased, 70%\u2026 60%\u2026 30%\u2026\u201cEveryone stand in a straight line facing the Boss! Quickly!\u201d Shi Feng hurriedly shouted when he saw Werewolf Felt\u2019s HP nearing 30%.Werewolf Felt would become the most frightening when its HP decreased to 30%. During this time, it was impossible to interrupt the Hell\u2019s Roar. They could only take it head on.No one had any hesitation; they knew that the Boss was about to go berserk. They immediately took action, forming a straight line against Werewolf Felt, while also maintaining a 30-yard distance away from it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe moment Werewolf Felt\u2019s HP reached 30%, its fur started changing colors. Within a moment, its fur had become snow white, and two streams of blood leaked from its eyes. Its chest also started to quickly expand, as if it was a swelled-up frog.Shi Feng immediately activated Gravity Liberation, quickly arriving in front of everyone else.\u201cCola, use Protection Blessing on me!\u201d Shi Feng loudly shouted.Protection Blessing was able to reduce the damage taken by a party member by 50% for a duration of 6 seconds. It was a lifesaving skill with a 5-minute Cooldown, and right now was the perfect moment to use it.[Protection Blessing] of Guardian Knights and [Shield Wall] of Shield Warriors. These two skills had a high drop rate inside the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest. Before, the reason why Shi Feng had wasted time on clearing out some unnecessary Night Rabbits was all to obtain this skill, Protection Blessing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The instant Shi Feng let out the command, his mouth began chanting divine texts. Streaks of golden divine texts rushed at Shi Feng.Protection Blessing!Suddenly, Shi Feng was surrounded by countless golden divine texts, giving off a dazzling golden glow.At the same time, Drowsy Sloth, at the rear of the line, continuously cast Recover and Life Prayer, pulling Shi Feng\u2019s HP back up to full and returning him to his best condition.\u201cPrepare for a battering attack. Absolutely do not leave from my back.\u201d Seeing Werewolf Felt\u2019s line of sight shifting towards them, Shi Feng held the Abyssal Blade across his chest as he commanded.Hearing Shi Feng\u2019s words, everyone started to tense up.Their hearts were not courageous, to begin with. Now, their hearts started to madly beat. They were being covered in a cold sweat even before Werewolf Felt used its skill.Suddenly, Werewolf Felt moved. Its expanded chest started moving upwards, moving past its throat and to its mouth.Hou!Within an instant, everyone aside from Shi Feng felt their hearts stop beating. It was as if the world had turned gray and silent. The soaring birds in the sky had also turned motionless.Everyone could clearly see the multitude of gray-colored waves being emitted from Werewolf Felt\u2019s body. Streak after streak, it continuously expanded.The dark gray ripples quickly arrived in front of everyone. However, they could not move even a muscle. It was not because they did not wish to move, but because their bodies could not keep up with the speed of their thoughts.Everyone could feel that time was moving by at an exceptionally slow pace. However, everyone understood that although the movement of time appeared slow, in reality, it was moving at the pinnacle of speed. Just like absolute experts crossing swords; the moment the exchange happened, time would move exceptionally slowly.At this moment, only Shi Feng slightly moved.Phantom Kill!The instant the dark gray ripples arrived in front of Shi Feng, his doppelganger had blocked in front of him. At the same time, the doppelganger used Parry.Subsequently, the gray ripples made contact with the doppelganger. However, they were blocked by the doppelganger\u2019s Parry, whereas the doppelganger himself retreated a step back. He only stabilized his body after colliding with Shi Feng.Just after the doppelganger stabilized himself, another wave of ripples came smashing.The ripples passed through the doppelganger\u2019s body this time, causing his HP to instantly decrease by 300 points. Behind him, Shi Feng had also received -30 damage, while the others behind Shi Feng received -20 damage.However, the ripples did not stop with just one wave. When the third wave of ripples passed through the doppelganger, his body had instantly disintegrated. A damage of -100 points also appeared above Shi Feng\u2019s head. Subsequently, wave after wave of dark gray ripples followed.-100, -100, -100, -100, \u2026\u2026Shi Feng\u2019s HP fell time and time again until only 90 points remained. When the final wave of ripples was about to get rid of Shi Feng, he used Parry.Hong! Shi Feng retreated a big step backward. However, he did not receive any damage. The people behind him were also unharmed. However, their HP after going through several waves of attacks did not exceed 50%.At this moment, Drowsy Sloth\u2019s Recover had only landed on Shi Feng\u2019s body, pulling Shi Feng\u2019s HP back to 140. Following which he used Life Payment, recovering 130 HP for Shi Feng. Within a moment, Shi Feng\u2019s HP had returned to over 50%.\u201cThis roar really is powerful. I even thought we were finished,\u201d Blackie wiped off the cold sweat from his forehead. If Shi Feng had not blocked in front of them, they would all be goners by now. When he thought back to how Shi Feng nearly died, Blackie\u2019s heart started beating rapidly, reaching 180 beats per minute.If Shi Feng died, then they would die as well; there was nobody else in the party who could pin down Werewolf Felt for a long period of time.At this moment, everyone looked at Shi Feng as if they were looking at a monster. Never would they have imagined that Shi Feng would ingeniously use his doppelganger to block two of those onslaughts. He had also used Parry on the final attack. The way Shi Feng had calculated both damage and HP was absolutely brilliant. Such a technique definitely belonged to the realm of gods.\u201cStop daydreaming, all of you! Quickly attack the Boss; it\u2019s in a Weakened state right now!\u201d Shi Feng only shrugged his shoulders at his party\u2019s reaction. Such a technique could be done by many experts in a few more years.However, Shi Feng had yet to relax. The thing he had to pay attention to the most right now was the Boss. Only he knew how hard it was to deal with Werewolf Felt.Wind Blade!With Gravity Liberation activated, Shi Feng instantly arrived in front of Felt. He tightly gripped the Abyssal Blade, continuously sending attacks towards Felt\u2019s chest.Thundering Flash!Double Chop!Chop!Damage that exceeded -100 appeared above Werewolf Felt\u2019s head, one after another. The other party members were also able to deal damage of over -20 with each attack. Very quickly, they had reduced Werewolf Felt\u2019s HP down to 15%.When they saw that Felt was about to die, everyone revealed smiles of excitement.\u201cDon\u2019t be careless. Blackie, use your Evil Whip. Lonely Snow, prepare to interrupt with Charge.\u201d Shi Feng commanded as he dodged Werewolf Felt\u2019s attack.Being told what to do in such a way, everyone\u2019s hearts suddenly constricted.A Death Stare and a Hell\u2019s Roar was already unimaginably terrifying. If it was any other party here, they would have long since revived back at the graveyard.Could Werewolf Felt actually have another powerful skill? How horrifying was this Hell Mode?!Shi Feng constantly paid attention to Werewolf Felt\u2019s HP. Just when Felt\u2019s HP fell down to 10%, its third big move finally came.Death Berserk!This move would increase Werewolf Felt\u2019s Attack Speed by 100%, its Movement Speed by 40%, and its Attack Power by 100% until it died. It was precisely this move that had caused countless Elite parties to curse out in madness.After activating Death Berserk, Werewolf Felt\u2019s fur started turning red; in a moment, it had become blood-red in color. Adding in its crimson red eyes and sharp fangs, Felt looked remarkably like a Blood Fiend. Its terrifying appearance had caused everyone to inadvertently retreat a step backward. They could clearly feel the air of danger given off by Felt.Shi Feng used another Double Chop, stacking the Bleeding effect to five layers. Afterward, he spun around and ran.After activating Death Berserk, there was no one under Level 5 who was able to block Felt. That included Shi Feng, even if he had a Magic Weapon. The only method was to kite[1] it and slowly grinding Felt to death.The moment Shi Feng had escaped the 10-yard distance, Felt\u2019s thick thighs suddenly doubled in size. One of its legs abruptly stomped the ground, sending it flying like an arrow, rushing towards Shi Feng.Shi Feng was about to arrive at the location of the large rock, but behind him, Felt\u2019s speed was just too fast. He definitely could not make it. Shi Feng abruptly made a 90-degrees sharp turn.Hong!Without making any turns, Werewolf Felt smashed straight into the large rock blocking its path, turning it into rubble. Fragmented rocks the size of a person\u2019s head were sent flying more than 10 yards away. Seeing such horrifying strength, even a fierce man such as Cola had his heart trembling.If he were struck by those claws, then he would definitely become meat paste\u2026\u2026At this moment, Shi Feng had already distanced himself over 20 yards from Felt. Meanwhile, the attacks from the mages never stopped. They continuously ground away Felt\u2019s HP.Shi Feng\u2019s plan to kite Felt was a success. Every time Werewolf Felt was about to catch up, Lonely Snow would Charge at it. He then followed it up with a Bone Crusher, greatly reducing Felt\u2019s speed. Afterward, he pulled away from Felt once more. When Lonely Snow\u2019s skills were on Cooldown, Blackie would use Evil Whip to constrict Felt once more. The skills of the two of them had a quick Cooldown. With Shi Feng\u2019s occasional Abyssal Bind, they had formed a perfect cycle to toy with Werewolf Felt without pause.7%\u2026 6%\u2026 5%\u2026 3%\u2026Finally, when Felt only had 1% HP remaining, Shi Feng abruptly turned around.Wind Blade! Thundering Flash! Chop! Double Chop!Shi Feng\u2019s single sword slashed at Werewolf Felt\u2019s chest, taking away its final 1% HP.System: Your party is the first to clear a Hell Mode Dungeon. Rewards increased by 100%; loot increased by 100%.System: Cleared Hell Mode of Deathly Forest. Rewarding 8000 EXP.At this moment, Werewolf Felt exploded, dropping out over 10 items. And amongst them, there was one that made Shi Feng\u2019s eyes shine.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euCrimson Blade!It was a sword that had the color of fresh blood. It gave off a dull red glow, and there was also faint drops of red liquid dripping off the edges of the blade. The entire sword revealed a dense killing aura.Shi Feng never imagined that the item with an abysmal drop rate would actually appear in front of him.TL Notes:[1] kite: A term in video gaming and elsewhere to describe when a ranged fighter skirmishes with a hand-to-hand fighter by running and shooting.

He quickly picked up the one-handed sword filled with killing intent.The Crimson Blade was one of the rarest drops within the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest. It was also the best sword for a Swordsman below Level 6.[Crimson Blade] (Secret-Silver Rank, One-Handed Sword)Level 3Equipment Requirement: Strength 12Attack Power +21Strength +5, Agility +6, Endurance +3Durability 30/30Its Attack Power alone could rival a Level 5 Two-Handed Bronze Axe. With the six extra points in Agility, it could increase the Attack Speed of a Swordsman by quite a lot. The Crimson Blade was definitely a precious weapon for Swordsmen.Unfortunately, Shi Feng could not equip it yet. His experience was currently at 69% of Level 2. There was still quite an amount before he could reach Level 3. Moreover, he wouldn\u2019t be able to equip it even if he had reached Level 3. This was because Swordsmen would only activate the Dual-Wielding Talent after they reached Level 5. At that time, Shi Feng would be able to wield two one-handed swords.By the time Shi Feng was Level 5, he would be able to wield the Abyssal Blade on his main-arm, and the Crimson Blade on his sub-arm. His Attack Power would be invincible amongst Level 5 players. Shi Feng felt great just thinking about such a future.\u201cBrother Feng, hurry up and pick up the equipment! I\u2019m dying of anxiety here!\u201d Blackie urged.\u201cThat\u2019s right, party leader! You can\u2019t just enjoy it by yourself! At least let us have a look at what equipment dropped!\u201dThe loot on the ground had nearly blinded everyone\u2019s eyes. The anxiety burning in their hearts had even caused them to forget their joy of reaching Level 2. They all wished to take a look at the drops of the two Hell Mode Bosses. As for rushing over to snatch the loot, there was nobody present who would do such a thing. Even if the items on the ground were valuable, they still wouldn\u2019t do it.If they had done such a thing, although they could feel great for the moment, they would instead regret their actions for the rest of their lives. This was because Shi Feng was the true treasure here. Even if Shi Feng wanted all of the equipment, there would not be a single person who would refuse him. After all, the only reason they could make it to this point was all because of Shi Feng. That was why everyone was just standing by the side, obediently watching instead of rushing up to fight for the loot.\u201cAlright, alright. No need to rush.\u201d Shi Feng smiled. He quickly began to collect the items on the ground. Shi Feng was very satisfied with everyone\u2019s performance.They were unlike the players Shi Feng would occasionally party up with in his previous life. When the Boss died, those players would rush up in unison to snatch the equipment. They immediately disappeared once they took all the equipment, leaving Shi Feng enraged and speechless.The reason Shi Feng did not set the party so that only the leader could pick drops was to test everyone\u2019s intentions. It was better to discover those treacherous people early on. Now that nobody had rushed up to snatch the items, Shi Feng could be more at ease with them.In a short moment, Shi Feng had collected all the loot on the ground. There were a total of 19 pieces of equipment and 5 Silver Coins. Such a harvest could rival the assets of a large Guild in its entirety.Arranging his bag, Shi Feng\u2019s lips curled up into a smile. He found a Forging Design.[Garrison Armor Forging Design]Able to create a piece of Level 3 Bronze-ranked Chest Armor after learning the design.Materials Required: 20 Copper Ores, 5 Bronze Ores, 5 Magic EssencesThis piece of equipment was a good item. As long as a party\u2019s MT equipped it, diving into the Normal Mode of the Deathly Forest would become much easier. Not only did it have high Defense and Strength, it also increased maximum HP by 200 points. It was an extremely important piece of equipment for any MT.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, when this equipment was released, every Guild madly fought over it. They also ignored all costs to enter the Deathly Forest in order to obtain this Forging Design.When Blackie saw Shi Feng\u2019s excited smile, his heart became even more anxious.It was needless to say for the other people, if a person\u2019s sight could kill, Shi Feng probably would have died over hundreds or thousands of times by now.\u201cThe items are not bad. Here, you guys have a look.\u201d Shi Feng did not waste any more time. He immediately displayed the Attributes of all the equipment.There were a total of 15 pieces of equipment. Amongst them, there was only a single Secret-Silver Equipment, which was the Crimson Blade. There were also 5 pieces of Mysterious-Iron Equipment and 9 pieces of Bronze Equipment. The Bronze Equipment dropped by the Bosses of Hell Mode were all of the highest quality. The Bronze Equipment dropped by Elites were far from comparable.Amongst all the equipment, after the Crimson Blade, the most valuable items were the pieces of Mysterious-Iron Equipment. Out of the three Modes of the Deathly Forest, only Hell Mode dropped Mysterious-Iron Equipment, whereas Normal and Difficult only dropped Bronze Equipment.Blackie\u2019s luck had always been good. Amongst the five pieces of Mysterious-Iron Equipment, there were two pieces of the Dark Color Set meant for Cursemancers. The Dark Color Set was definitely the Set Equipment for Cursemancers below Level 5. There were a total of five pieces in the Dark Color Set; head, chest, legs, shoes, armguards. This time around, the parts that dropped were the chest and shoes. These two items had placed a wide smile on Blackie\u2019s face.\u201cBrother Feng, I really love coming down to Hell! Let\u2019s come here once every day. That way, I can complete the Dark Color Set, and if anyone dares look down upon us at that time, I\u2019ll blast him to pieces!\u201d Blackie showed off the Dark Color Set in his hands.After wearing the Dark Color Set, Blackie felt himself becoming closer to an expert. His Magic Attack was increased to 66; a single Level 3 Dark Arrow could take away more than half the HP of a Level 1 Shield Warrior. If he could complete the Dark Color Set, then a single Dark Arrow could one-shot a Shield Warrior.He put on the suit of ash-gray fur robes, coupled with glistening pitch-black boots; everyone could tell they were pieces of a set with just a glance.The others drooled when they saw the black luster of the Dark Color Set. Their hearts were filled with hatred and envy for Blackie.They had never imagined entering Hell would be such a great experience. They truly hoped they could enter Hell a few more times in the future.The remaining three pieces of Mysterious-Iron Equipment were the set pieces for Guardian Knight, Shield Warrior, and Elementalist. Amongst those present, only Cola was a Guardian Knight. Thus, Shi Feng gave the piece of equipment to Cola and stored the others.As for the remaining Bronze Equipment, Cola received a shield and Lonely Snow received a greatsword. Both pieces of Level 2 equipment had the best Attributes possible on them. Drowsy Sloth and Gluttonous Mouse also received a piece of Bronze Equipment each.Quite a few pieces of Shi Feng\u2019s equipment were also replaced. Amongst the Bronze Equipment, there were three pieces that belonged to Swordsman. The two pieces of equipment that remained were stored away by Shi Feng.When everyone had changed their equipment, it was as if the entire party had a makeover. Every piece of their equipment was incomparably brilliant. Just a glance was enough to tell that they didn\u2019t just have Common Equipment. The entire party had also risen to Level 2. Blackie\u2019s experience was even at 98% of Level 2, just a tad bit short of Level 3.The other four items were a Forging Design, a Potion Recipe, a rare skill for Cursemancers, and a notebook.The rare skill for Cursemancers overjoyed Blackie. It was an AOE skill called [Hell Flame].[Hell Flame]Deals 150% Flame Damage to an 8 x 8 yard area. Duration of 5 seconds.Cooldown: 36 seconds.It was a godly skill for grinding monsters during the early periods of the game.\u201cWhat is this thing for?\u201d Shi Feng looked at the old notebook in his hand. He could not recall the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest dropping such an item.Taking a look inside, Shi Feng discovered words which he could not understand. However, Shi Feng knew these words belonged to the Ancient Language of the Elves.Within God\u2019s Domain, any items which had a relationship with the Elven language were definitely not common items. Just like the Ring Of Gravity, there was a string of Elvish words carved onto it. They had allowed the ring to possess unimaginable powers.\u201cIt seems I have to make a trip to the library.\u201dShi Feng felt this notebook was not as simple as it seemed. In his previous life, he entered the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest tens of times. However, he had never seen such an item drop before. There was no such news from the other teams in the Guild as well. The likelihood of the notebook dropping only on the First Kill was high. If Shi Feng wanted to make heads with the situation, he had to translate its contents at the library.\u201cBrother Feng, what are we going to do afterward? Grinding mobs?\u201d Blackie was eager to try out the new skill he learned.\u201cThat\u2019s fine as well. We\u2019ll grind and do Quests in Dark Moon Valley. The monsters there drop quite a lot of ore\u201d Shi Feng said after some thought.With the Forging Design in hand, all that was left was to obtain the materials. However, Shi Feng needed a lot of materials. Now that Blackie had Hell Flame, it should be a lot quicker to kill Kobolds and Gnomes. Furthermore, Shi Feng knew of a few good locations where it would be suitable to use Hell Flame.Shi Feng turned to look at the others, saying, \u201cWill you guys follow us or do Quests on your own?\u201d\u201cBig Brother Feng, how could you leave me out of grinding mobs? I\u2019ve already planned to follow Big Brother Feng in the future.\u201d Cola smiled like a fool as he gently caressed his new shield.\u201cBig Brother Feng, can we join as well?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDrowsy Sloth and Gluttonous Mouse were both high-schoolers. Currently, they had their heads lowered in embarrassment. However, they did not wish to give up such a chance. Shi Feng was a great expert. They would reap endless benefits if they could learn a thing or two by staying by his side.Shi Feng said, smiling, \u201cOf course you are all welcome to join.\u201dSuddenly, the two of them revealed excited expressions, both their hands clenched up in excitement.\u201cSince nobody is opposed to it, then we will go grind in Dark Moon Valley.\u201dAfter finishing his piece, Shi Feng called out the System Panel. He selected the Dungeon\u2019s Party Teleportation, parting with the Deathly Forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32 \u2013 Stunning InvitationThere was a sea of players in front of the Deathly Forest. Currently, they were all gathered around the Dungeon\u2019s entrance.Such a situation was due to the actions of the large Guilds of Red Leaf Town. The Elite teams of these large Guilds had all arrived at the Deathly Forest. They were all prepared to challenge the Dungeon. These teams were much stronger than the loosely made Elite parties. Common Equipment covered their entire bodies. There were even pieces of Bronze Equipment in the mix.\u201cThat\u2019s Heaven\u2019s Crown\u2019s core MT, Immovable Mountain. Never have I imagined that even he would come to this place. Someone will surely clear the Deathly Forest this time.\u201d\u201cHmph, Heaven\u2019s Crown is just a third-rate Guild. Look over there; even the Sub-Leader of Assassin\u2019s Alliance, Stabbing Heart, is here. Also, the Guardian Knight named War Soul by his side is the top five Knight of the Assassin\u2019s Alliance. He is even stronger than the Immovable Mountain.\u201dThe players in the surrounding area started a discussion amongst themselves. They held optimistic views towards these large Guilds at clearing the Deathly Forest. It was to be expected, as there were over ten Guilds currently present, both large and small. Amongst these Guilds, the most well-known Guild would be the second-rate Guild, Assassin\u2019s Alliance. Following them would be the third-rate Guild, Heaven\u2019s Crown. The others were just some unknown Guilds, but they still would not be looked down on. This was because a Workshop stood behind every Guild. These Workshops hired experts. Average players could not compare to them.Each large Guild wanted to build its reputation in Red Leaf Town. Conquering the first Dungeon in Red Leaf Town was the perfect way to do so. Hence, all of the large Guilds made ample preparations for the Dungeon. They spent large sums of their assets to buy equipment and medicine. They also bought a lot of information on the Deathly Forest. So, they were extremely confident about conquering the Dungeon.\u201cBoss Waving, these Guild teams have gorgeous equipment! They will definitely clear the Deathly Forest this time,\u201d Wordless Summer Night commented with a pained expression.Waving Slowly But Surely crossed his arms in front of his chest. He nodded slightly, saying in a helpless tone, \u201cThe Deathly Forest is too difficult. We party-wiped before we even met the Boss. In the end, parties like ours only became scouts for the Guilds.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to brag about being a Guild\u2019s expert? Boss, it\u2019s not our skills that are lacking. The Dungeon is just too horrifying. It has too high of an equipment quality requirement,\u201d the Shield Warrior, Battle To The End said in disdain. He held contempt for the Guild experts deep in his heart, and he was sure only their equipment prevented them from clearing the Dungeon.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Boss. If our party had such equipment, we would have long since cleared the Deathly Forest\u201d Wordless Summer Night confidently said.Speaking of Dungeons, Wordless Summer thought of Shi Feng\u2019s party. He giggled as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t have any gain. We\u2019ve killed two Night Rabbits and even got a skill book for Berserkers. Compared to that party led by Captain Noob, we\u2019re much stronger. They still haven\u2019t shown themselves. I guess they\u2019ve already fled from embarrassment. It sure is a pity for Lonely Snow. If he followed the Boss, then he would have been given this skill book. If he found out about it, he would regret not following us into the Dungeon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Lonely Snow doesn\u2019t know how to appreciate the kindness given to him. Now, he will definitely regret not following the Boss,\u201d Battle To The End laughingly said.\u201cLonely Snow\u2019s skills are still quite good. I don\u2019t know how that noob managed to gain the favor of that expert called Blackie. However, no matter how great that expert\u2019s techniques are, with dead weight pulling him back they would still party-wipe. He is probably too ashamed to show himself right now. If he had gone with us, we might have cleared the Deathly Forest by now,\u201d Waving Slowly was silently pleased with Blackie\u2019s end.\u201cBoss, the Guilds are going to enter now,\u201d Wordless Summer said.However, just as the Guilds were about to enter the Deathly Forest, the Dungeon\u2019s teleportation gate suddenly changed color. It instantly turned from a silvery-gray to a pitch-black color. There was also an indistinct skull that was roaring.The many members of the Guilds couldn\u2019t help but retreat a few steps back.\u201cWhat is this situation?\u201dSuch a question appeared within everyone\u2019s hearts. However, they quickly received their answer.Six figures suddenly appeared in front of the Dungeon\u2019s entrance. Each and every one of them was clothed in glorious garments. Just by standing there, the six of them caused others to feel a faint pressure, especially the Cursemancer with the black-colored staff. The dark-gray colored equipment on the Cursemancer was clearly a set. A single glance was enough to tell they were not common goods. The materials it was made of were much better than Bronze Equipment.\u201cEh? Why are there so many people?\u201d Shi Feng took a look at his surroundings, discovering these people were the Elite teams of large Guilds. He was slightly confused as to why all these people were blocking the Dungeon\u2019s entrance.Shi Feng\u2019s party members also started to panic. The pressure from being watched by so many people was no weaker than facing off against a Boss monster.\u201cBoss Waving, look. Isn\u2019t that the noob?\u201d Wordless Summer pointed towards Shi Feng.Waving Slowly knitted his brows. Shi Feng was not the only person he spotted; there was also Lonely Snow. He curiously asked, \u201cHow could they be here? Didn\u2019t they run away long ago?\u201d\u201cIn my view, I think they did not even enter the forest of the Dungeon. They knew they could not clear the Dungeon, but they were also afraid of embarrassing themselves. So, they stayed in there until now.\u201d Battle To The End laughed, \u201cBut now they just happen to get caught after leaving the Dungeon. Just look at how ugly Lonely Snow\u2019s expression is.\u201d\u201cHahaha! As expected of a noob, he doesn\u2019t even have the courage to enter the Dungeon.\u201dWaving Slowly But Surely felt Wordless Summer Night\u2019s words made sense. If not, how could Shi Feng\u2019s party have returned safely? Waving Slowly and the other party members experienced the horrendous-ness of the Deathly Forest. After entering the forest of the Dungeon, there were only two possible results: either they cleared the Dungeon, or they party-wiped. There was no possibility of a third option. Now that Shi Feng\u2019s party had returned safely, there was only one possibility; they never entered the forest. It was impossible that they cleared the Deathly Forest.During the time Waving Slowly and company started laughing at Shi Feng\u2019s party, the players surrounding Shi Feng had already laughed themselves into madness. Such a scene confused Waving Slowly and party. Why were these people laughing at Shi Feng\u2019s party? Were they actually famous?What Waving Slowly\u2019s party did not know was that Shi Feng\u2019s party had already become famous throughout the entire Deathly Forest. Shi Feng\u2019s party mainly consisted of Level 1 noobs, yet they entered the Hell Mode of the Dungeon. There was no action more foolish than this. It would be hard for others not to notice such an action.As they say, \u201cBad news has wings.\u201d\u201cHahaha, that exotic player is back! I actually admired him for entering the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest, but he was just a coward.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore; my stomach hurts too much from laughing.\u201dThe players surrounding Shi Feng\u2019s party understood their actions. They had foolishly entered the Hell Mode of the Dungeon, so they could not enter deep into the Dungeon. Instead, they stayed around the Dungeon\u2019s entrance and looked for a time to leave the Dungeon in secret. Unfortunately, even God would not help them. They coincidentally left just to be seen by the many Guilds.\u201cBrother Feng, what\u2019s wrong with these people?\u201dBlackie looked at the laughing players laying on the ground. Scratching his head, he asked with an odd tone, \u201cDid their brains go bad? Why are they holding their stomachs and laughing on the ground?\u201d\u201cWho knows? Maybe their brains had a cramp. It seems we shouldn\u2019t play God\u2019s Domain too long, especially for the first time.\u201d Shi Feng did not think their appearance had any relation to the actions of these people. \u201cWe better leave. This is just giving me the creeps.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe other members of the party nodded in agreement. The players in the Deathly Forest were truly strange.\u201cBig brother, please hold on for a moment.\u201dJust as Shi Feng\u2019s party was about to leave the Dungeon\u2019s entrance, a ringing voice entered everyone\u2019s ears. Taking a look at the voice\u2019s origin, a beautiful and pure maiden dressed in a pure-white mage\u2019s robe was seen walking towards Shi Feng\u2019s party.Shi Feng recognized this person. She was Star-Moon Kingdom\u2019s top-hundred Cleric, Xiao Yue\u2019er.Xiao Yue\u2019er walked to Shi Feng with an embarrassed look, a blush appearing on her tender-white cheeks. She whispered, \u201cNice to meet you. I am Xiao Yue\u2019er of Ouroboros. We met before entering the Dungeon. Our party\u2019s leader wishes to have a chat with you about the Deathly Forest\u2019s Dungeon. I wonder\u2026\u2026 if you would be interested in sharing?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33 \u2013 Changing from Arrogance to Humility (1)Xiao Yue\u2019er\u2019s appearance shocked everyone present.Every player present knew who Xiao Yue\u2019er was. After all, she was the Goddess\u2019 party mate. Coupled with Xiao Yue\u2019er\u2019s beauty and purity, she was firmly implanted in everyone\u2019s memories.However, why would such a pure maiden invite a noob? Furthermore, what was harder to imagine was\u2026\u2026 the person who invited the noob was not Xiao Yue\u2019er, but the Goddess, Gentle Snow.Who was Gentle Snow?She was the publicly acknowledged Snow Goddess in the virtual gaming world. There were countless \u2018Mr. Perfect\u2019s who wanted to approach her. There was even a trust fund baby who had offered ten million Credits just to have a meal with Gentle Snow; however, that person did not even receive a word from her.Scram!That trust fund baby was naturally enraged. Thus, he sought to get revenge and turn Gentle Snow into his possession. Yet, a few days later, this trust fund baby was dumbfounded. His father, a self-made wealthy man, suddenly became a poor pauper. All of his father\u2019s properties had, within a night, become someone else\u2019s possession. When the trust fund baby\u2019s father found the cause, he nearly beat his son to death. From then onwards, everyone finally knew the dreadfulness of Gentle Snow. However, Gentle Snow\u2019s fans had further increased in number after this incident. Gentle Snow was like a true Goddess from the legends, divine and inviolable.Such a Goddess had actively invited such a noob. How could it not shock people?Currently, everyone was no longer in the mood for laughter. There was only envy and displeasure. What virtue and ability did a noob have to be invited to chat with the Goddess?\u201cDamn, this noob must have some dog-shit luck! Why him?! I\u2019m so handsome, yet the Goddess won\u2019t even speak a word to me.\u201d\u201cI, Jade Windtree, am an expert in God\u2019s Domain, but why won\u2019t the Goddess come have a chat with me? Could it be that I am too handsome? Or does the Goddess prefer a wilder type?\u201d\u201cThe Goddess must want to understand the situation inside the Hell Mode Dungeon. That\u2019s why she looked for him. I never imagined even noobs would have such benefits. If I had known earlier, I would have also entered Hell Mode once.\u201dEveryone started their own discussions. They glared at Shi Feng, having thoughts of disdain and envy towards him. They could not help but want to kill him right that instant.\u201cBoss Waving Slowly, I didn\u2019t hear wrong, right? That noob actually received an invite from the Goddess. I must have heard wrong\u201d Wordless Summer Night pinched his thick cheeks, saying with a foolish expression.\u201cIt should be right. However, the Goddess must have something she wishes to ask. He was only lucky; that\u2019s all,\u201d The prideful Waving Slowly deemed Shi Feng being able to chat with the Goddess was all just due to his luck.Battle To The End nodded his head to the side, agreeing to Waving Slowly But Surely\u2019s opinion.Gentle Snow was an existence they had looked up to. They were people of completely different worlds. Not to mention having a chat with her, they had already felt incredibly lucky just by being in the Deathly Forest with Gentle Snow.Just when everyone thought Shi Feng would smugly agree to the invitation, Shi Feng had instead given a contradictory answer.\u201cNot interested. I\u2019m in a rush for time,\u201d Shi Feng turned around and left immediately after responding. He did not care about Xiao Yue\u2019er in front of him at all, and he cared even less about Gentle Snow\u2019s invitation.Now that the Forging Design was in his hands, he only lacked ore. The quicker the Garrison Armor made its appearance, the greater Shi Feng\u2019s income would be. If he missed out on this great chance, he would lose a large sum of Coins.Blackie had been extremely excited when he thought he would be able to get close to the Goddess. Shi Feng\u2019s answer, however, nearly drove him to madness. There must be a mispositioned nerve inside Shi Feng\u2019s brain to reject the invitation.It was not just Blackie who was dumbfounded; even Xiao Yue\u2019er was shocked motionless. It was the first time she met a man who actually rejected Sister Snow\u2019s invitation. Many men begged for such an invitation, yet all of them remained empty-handed. Could this man be a fool?\u201cLet\u2019s go. What are you daydreaming about?\u201d He turned and asked his motionless party members when Shi Feng discovered nobody following him.\u201cBrother Feng, that\u2019s an invitation from the Snow Goddess. Won\u2019t you think about it some more?\u201d Blackie requested. His mind was bordering insanity right now. At the same time, his heart continually prayed for Shi Feng to agree quickly. Such a great chance would be impossible to come by in the future.\u201cI\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t have the time,\u201d Shi Feng responded with a smile. Shi Feng became speechless when he looked at Blackie\u2019s prayerful eyes. No matter what, Blackie\u2019s reverence for the Snow Goddess would not change one little bit.Currently, Gentle Snow and Zhao Yueru walked over. Clad in a silvery-white plate armor, Gentle Snow was undoubtedly the focus of the entire Deathly Forest. Everyone\u2019s eyes were glued to her perfectly curved body, their mouths drooling.Nobody had imagined Gentle Snow would personally make an appearance.Everyone\u2019s envy and hatred for Shi Feng grew even more.\u201cYou can be at ease. I will not waste too much of your time. This piece of Bronze Equipment can be your compensation,\u201d Gentle Snow carefully watched Shi Feng. She discovered Shi Feng was indeed different from other people. Although Shi Feng had a typical appearance, his body gave off a calm and steady feeling. There was also a faint murderous aura radiating from his body. Such temperament could only be honed after experiencing countless life-or-death battles.\u201cSnow?\u201d Zhao Yueru was shocked. She never thought Gentle Snow would think so highly of Shi Feng. Her beautiful eyes unwillingly turned towards Shi Feng. Her brows slightly creased, and she said in a contemptible tone, \u201dI don\u2019t think this fellow is worth a piece of Bronze Equipment; a piece of Gray Equipment at best.\u201dThey had already been respectful by inviting Shi Feng over for a chat. However, not only did Shi Feng not appreciate their kindness, he even rejected them immediately. If someone else received such an invite, they would have long since come running over to fawn over them. It was the first time Zhao Yueru met such an unattractive man who took such an action. She firmly believed Shi Feng had some scheme in his mind and there was nothing good about him.\u201cNo need for the Bronze Equipment. I have those things, myself,\u201d Shi Feng waved his hand, saying in an uncaring tone. He never tried to flatter the witch, to begin with, but he never imagined she would speak of him in such a way. However, he was not a poor ghost; he did not need any charity.Zhao Yueru\u2019s beautiful eyes measured up Shi Feng. She couldn\u2019t help but let loose a faint laughter, playfully saying, \u201cSuch an unyielding spirit. You clearly want it, yet you\u2019re refusing to admit it. Snow, this fellow is really insincere!\u201d\u201cYueru,\u201d Gentle Snow impatiently sent Zhao Yueru a glance, hinting her not to overdo it. To begin with, they were the ones who took the initiative to send the invite. It would not be proper to look down on others now.Zhao Yueru pouted. She shot a glance towards Shi Feng, puffing out her prideful twin peaks as she helplessly turned her head away. She did not think a poor fellow like Shi Feng would have anything they wanted.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSorry, please receive this piece of equipment as an apology,\u201dGentle Snow took out a Level 0 Bronze Belt meant for a Swordsmen and traded it to Shi Feng. She wanted to put an end to this matter.Shi Feng did not reject the offer after seeing Gentle Snow\u2019s sincerity. If he rejected it, it would only show how petty of a man he was. At the same time, he would cause Gentle Snow to think he did not wish to reconcile. He couldn\u2019t just keep on refusing the kindness of others. Besides, he was indeed missing a Bronze Belt. \u201cHehe, and here I thought you had some great ability. In the end, you still need it,\u201d Zhao Yueru said in disdain. She inwardly felt unfortunate to lose a piece of Bronze Equipment.They obtained this piece of equipment after killing a Rare Elite with much difficulty. It was an absolute waste now that their efforts were benefiting Shi Feng.Shi Feng slightly wrinkled his brows. Not even a man would be able to stand being mocked and ridiculed in such a way, not to mention a reincarnated person like Shi Feng.\u201cSince Miss Snow gave me a piece of Bronze Equipment, it is only proper for me to reciprocate in kind. Let this item be the return gift.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She felt astonished and thought Shi Feng was an interesting person. Shi Feng conducted himself properly, and he was not as hard to get along with as she had imagined.\u201cYou? Gifting Snow a present? Do you think Snow would even want it?\u201d Zhao Yueru could not help but turn her head around. Her fresh red lips curled into a seductive smile, and her eyes held a sneer within them. She was silently laughing at Shi Feng\u2019s overestimation of himself. What kind of item has Gentle Snow not seen before? Even luxury cars worth over ten million could not catch her attention, not to mention an item within a game.Currently, Shi Feng took out a piece of paper from his bag. This drawing was one of the drops from the Boss. Shi Feng nonchalantly passed the item over to Gentle Snow.When Zhao Yueru saw Shi Feng take out a piece of scrap paper and give it as a present to Gentle Snow, she could not help but coldly say, \u201cAre you trying to make a fool of us?\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d Shi Feng said in a serious tone.\u201cSnow gave you a piece of Bronze Equipment, yet what about you? You took out a piece of scrap paper to trick her. Do you think a piece of scrap paper could compare to a piece of Bronze Equipment? If you\u2019re not playing us for fools, then what are you trying to do?\u201d hearing Shi Feng\u2019s answer, Zhao Yueru was further enraged.Behind Shi Feng, Blackie and the others were each covered in a cold sweat.Even if you did not wish to chat with the Goddess, you still should not make a fool of her! Wasn\u2019t this just courting death?!They clearly obtained a good amount of equipment inside the Dungeon, and just simply giving one of those pieces would easily solve the problem. If Shi Feng\u2019s actions angered the Goddess, even if the Goddess herself did not take action, the players surrounding them would surely kill them off for her.Seeing a mishap about to occur, Blackie thought of giving away the Bronze Staff he held. However, Gentle Snow gladly received the scrap paper Shi Feng gave her.Suddenly, Blackie and everyone else\u2019s mouths formed a \u20180h\u2019 shape.The Goddess accepted it? What kind of situation was this?\u201cThank you for your present; I like it very much. Now, can we go somewhere with fewer people to have our chat?\u201d Gentle Snow smiled in appreciation.Shi Feng also smiled and nodded in agreement. Looking at Gentle Snow\u2019s faint smile was like watching a dazzling sun that warmed a person\u2019s heart. It would be hard to forget such a smile, even after a lifetime.\u201cSnow, you\u2019re going to forgive his rude actions just like that?\u201d Zhao Yueru asked in a puzzled tone.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Yueru. I like this item very much,\u201d Gentle Snow turned around after commenting, letting Shi Feng lead the way.Zhao Yueru was stunned. She just could not understand what kind of drug Shi Feng had given Gentle Snow. Was a piece of scrap paper enough?Just what was this piece of scrap paper?\u201cSnow, just what did that fellow give you?\u201d Zhao Yueru whispered. Just by seeing the fire poker on Shi Feng\u2019s waist, she could tell Shi Feng would not be able to give anything valuable. However, Gentle Snow still happily received it. Such a result puzzled Zhao Yueru significantly.\u201cA Potion Recipe for the Basic Strength Potion. When consumed, it will increase a player\u2019s Strength by 6 points for half an hour,\u201d Gentle Snow calmly replied.\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhao Yueru leaped up in shock. \u201cHow could he have such a precious recipe?\u201dPotionmaking was very hard to learn. The recipes needed were famed for being rare drops, even the current Ouroboros only had a few normal recipes, not to mention rare recipes. A recipe that was capable of increasing the Strength of a player by 6 points was unheard of until now.If the current Level 2 players could have an extra 6 points in Strength, that would equate to an additional 12 Attack Power. Such a potion would have a significant effect when they dove into a Dungeon. Regarding Guilds who frequently conquered Dungeons, the value of this recipe far surpassed that of tens of pieces of Bronze Equipment. As long as the Basic Strength Potion were for sale, the supply would never be able to meet the demand. Yet, Shi Feng gifted such a recipe away.Did Shi Feng not know the value of this recipe? However, Zhao Yueru shook her head, denying this assumption. Before, she had seen the confident expression on Shi Feng\u2019s face. He knew the immense value it had towards their guild.Currently, Zhao Yueru turned her head once more towards Shi Feng. A tinge of red appeared on her cheeks when she thought back to what she said before. She felt humiliated. She actually called a rare recipe a scrap paper. When she thought of Shi Feng\u2019s smile, he was definitely laughing at her lack of knowledge. He was such a hateful bastard!\u201cNow you finally know. I\u2019ve already said he wasn\u2019t simple,\u201d Gentle Snow smiled at Zhao Yueru.Even after Gentle Snow and Shi Feng left the scene, the surrounding players had yet to recover themselves.What kind of situation was this?A noob actually received the attention of the Goddess. Was this person really a noob?\u201cBoss Waving Slowly, that noob left with the Goddess.\u201d Wordless Summer Night was very upset. After watching the Goddess being very courteous with Shi Feng, even an idiot could tell Shi Feng was not that simple.\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. I\u2019ve heard from others that the noob entered the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest. The Snow Goddess must\u2019ve intentionally invited him to learn about the difficulty of Hell Mode,\u201d Waving Slowly did not believe that he would misjudge a person. Shi Feng was definitely a noob. He must have just been incredibly fortunate. Before, he managed to gain the favor of an expert. Now, he also somehow managed to obtain the favor of the Goddess.In a rock pit over 200 yards south of the Deathly Forest, Gentle Snow and Shi Feng sat facing each other. Surrounding them was a beautiful scenery and gurgling streams. As for the others, they stood to the sides. None of them tried to eavesdrop on the conversation between Shi Feng and Gentle Snow. They comfortably sat down and started chatting amongst themselves.\u201cI wonder what business Miss Snow has for me?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe Deathly Forest.\u201d Gentle Snow openly said, \u201cI want the strategy for the Deathly Forest. State your price.\u201d\u201cHehe, I\u2019m afraid Miss Snow is overthinking things. How could I have the strategy to the Deathly Forest? I\u2019ve only entered the Dungeon once,\u201d Shi Feng would not admit to possessing the strategy. It would bring about the suspicion of others. After all, God\u2019s Domain was a game constructed by the Main God System. Even Beta Testers would not know a detailed strategy for the Dungeon. It was still possible to trick amateurs such as Blackie, but it was impossible to trick Gentle Snow. Troubles would arise if Shi Feng were to generously share his strategy.Gentle Snow smiled sweetly; her eyes swept once across Shi Feng\u2019s party members before calmly saying, \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, the equipment your party members are wearing all came from the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest. Although your party has one or two players with proper techniques, everyone knows you had invited three Level 1 noobs as temporary members. Such a party was able to enter Hell Mode, and even came out with quite a lot of equipment. Do you think I would believe you if you said you did not have any information?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not twist our words around. I know you\u2019re a Beta Tester, and not just any Beta Tester. You must have done detailed research on the Deathly Forest. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be able to clear the Dungeon at all. This Basic Strength Potion Recipe is the best evidence as to why I would say you\u2019ve cleared it. You can rest assured however that I will not reveal your secret.\u201d Gentle Snow fixated her gaze on Shi Feng as if she saw through Shi Feng\u2019s entire being.\u201cAlright, what you say is correct.\u201d Shi Feng shrugged his shoulders, silently letting loose a breath. He never thought Gentle Snow would fill up the questionable gaps. It would not be any better for Shi Feng if Gentle Snow thought in such a way.\u201cState your price then,\u201d Gentle Snow was all smiles with Shi Feng. It was as though she was saying, \u201cDid you think I could not control a person like you? This lady knows everything.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35 \u2013 Changing from Arrogance to Humility (3)Seeing Gentle Snow smile with confidence, Shi Feng was already snickering in silence.Sheep\u2019s wool comes from a sheep. If you wished to earn money, it was natural to obtain it from a wealthy person. A first-rate Guild like Ouroboros was unquestionably an appropriate target.According to Shi Feng\u2019s knowledge the Guild, Ouroboros, had already conquered over ten virtual reality games. However, the appearance of God\u2019s Domain had shaken the virtual gaming world. It was dubbed as mankind\u2019s second world. It caused the collapse of many other virtual reality games. Afterward, countless companies started madly investing in God\u2019s Domain, nurturing their Guild, growing their influence, and building their place in the virtual financial world. Naturally, Ouroboros also invested in God\u2019s Domain. They, too, wanted to share a bite of the countless assets.Also, Ouroboros was not just wealthy; it also had a great background. The number of experts working under Ouroboros exceeded over a thousand. These thousand men were famed as the God-Slaying Army in God\u2019s Domain. The existence of these thousand experts allowed Ouroboros to establish a large virtual Empire. They unified over eighty Cities in God\u2019s Domain that each had a population of over a million players. Ouroboros was a true tyrant in God\u2019s Domain.During Ouroboros\u2019 peak, it was the equivalent to the entire Star-Moon Kingdom. As for Shadow, it had only established ten Cities that did not have populations exceeding a million players. In such a way, Ouroboros had become a peerless tyrant in the real world. Their position was truly unimaginable.It should be known that Star-Moon Kingdom was a relatively large kingdom, even amongst the hundreds present in God\u2019s Domain. It was at the upper middle-ranks. One could clearly see Ouroboros\u2019 prowess when compared to it.How could Shi Feng not wish to work with such a powerful Guild? It was just the risk of working with Gentle Snow was too high. Because of her particular identity, the information she could get a hold of was just too great. Shi Feng could not help but be cautious of her. It was why he intentionally revealed some hints, especially with the recipe for the Basic Strength Potion. He wanted to see Gentle Snow\u2019s reaction. If she behaved in a bad way, Shi Feng would naturally act ignorant and push all responsibility away.However, the present situation was undoubtedly the one Shi Feng looked forward to the most.\u201cSince you\u2019ve already explained\u2026 My asking price isn\u2019t high. Twenty Silver Coins.\u201d Shi Feng calmly stated.To a small Guild of current times, 20 Silver Coins would already be their entire fortune. Even a hundred-man money-farming group would need two to three days to collect such an amount.Zhao Yueru sucked in a cold breath, nearly jumping up when she heard Shi Feng casually ask for 20 Silver Coins. She stared at Shi Feng, furiously saying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just rob someone? That would be a faster way.\u201d\u201cI would do it if I could get that much money,\u201d Shi Feng said with a smile. \u201cYou should know there is a lot of skill books, weapons, and equipment for players inside the Deathly Forest. They can quickly increase the strength of players. If you could conquer the Deathly Forest a step earlier, the benefits it would bring towards future developments go without saying.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 Can\u2019t you make it a little cheaper? Twenty Silvers? Even we, Ouroboros, can\u2019t simply take out that much money,\u201d Zhao Yueru thoroughly disliked Shi Feng now. However, when she thought about the importance of the Deathly Forest, she still used a softer tone to speak to Shi Feng.\u201cSorry, but no negotiations. If you don\u2019t agree to it, then I can only consider working with some other Guild,\u201d Shi Feng remained firm with his decision. He had been very sincere in dealing with Gentle Snow. If it was still not possible, he could only consider the Assassin\u2019s Alliance. The Assassin\u2019s Alliance was wealthy and imposing. Before, they spent over 20 Silvers to buy Shi Feng\u2019s Level 5 Bronze Shield.\u201cI understand. Twenty Silvers then. However, we need some time to collect the money. After all, our Ouroboros\u2019 area of influence isn\u2019t in White River City, but at the capital, Star-Moon City. There are only a few Ouroboros members close to White River City. Give me a day\u2019s time, take these 7 Silvers as a deposit. I will compensate you with 15 Silvers a day later.\u201d Gentle Snow had never imagined Shi Feng\u2019s appetite would be so great. Twenty Silvers was still a lot to her. However, the importance of clearing the Deathly Forest was too great. They had to grasp it as soon as possible. At the same time, Gentle Snow knew that Silver Coins were precious during the early periods of the game. Hence, she had given a little more to Shi Feng as interest.\u201cAlright. Here is the map of the Deathly Forest, and also the things you need to pay attention to when fighting against the Boss.\u201dShi Feng also knew what Gentle Snow had said was true. Wanting to gather 20 Silver Coins would not be easy. Ouroboros did not have as great of influence in White River City as the Assassin\u2019s Alliance did. Shi Feng sent mail to Gentle Snow containing detailed introductions to the Deathly Forest. With Gentle Snow\u2019s abilities, they should be able to clear Normal Mode easily.Gentle Snow looked at the strategy she received for the Deathly Forest; her heart slightly shook only after a slight glance.She never imagined the Deathly Forest would be so horrifying. Just the number of paths available already numbered thirty-six. Thirty-three of them were dead ends. There was even a Night Ranger who moved based on opportunity. There was also a detailed description of the Boss and when it would cast its skills. She definitely got more than 20 Silver\u2019s worth of information. If she sent others to explore the paths bit by bit, the cost would exceed 20 Silvers.Suddenly, another change occurred to Gentle Snow\u2019s perception of Shi Feng. She felt Shi Feng was not as simple as he seemed to be. He was certainly an expert. Only an expert could have such a profound understanding of the Dungeon. However, Gentle Snow had no recollection of an expert Swordsman like Shi Feng.\u201cIn three days Ouroboros is planning to enter the first Level 5, twenty-man Dungeon, the Dark Moon Graveyard. I wonder if you will be interested in joining?\u201d Gentle Snow\u2019 beautiful eyes looked towards Shi Feng as she invited him to the Team Dungeon. She already acknowledged Shi Feng\u2019s strength. If Shi Feng was with them, entering the Team Dungeon, they might have an easier time in it.From a side, Blackie looked at Shi Feng with dumbstruck eyes. His admiration for Shi Feng had already reached the level of worship. He never imagined Shi Feng would be so awesome as to conquer the Snow Goddess in a few moves. The Goddess even wished to invite him to raid a Dungeon. How great of an honor was this? There were countless men who dreamt of raiding a Dungeon with the Snow Goddess.However, Zhao Yueru became irritated after hearing Gentle Snow invite him. Shi Feng was but a Beta Tester. At most, he had experienced God\u2019s Domain a few more days than they did and had a deeper understanding of the Deathly Forest. However, the twenty-man Team Dungeon had only opened after the game\u2019s official release. It did not exist during the Beta Test, so there was no way for Shi Feng to know anything about it. Also, Shi Feng wasn\u2019t some powerful expert; what point would there be in inviting him? He would just be wasting a slot in the Dungeon.Shi Feng entered a thought. There were a lot of good items that dropped from a twenty-man Dungeon. It had been particularly true for the Dark Moon Graveyard which dropped a lot of worthwhile equipment for Swordsman. The Attributes of the equipment from that Dungeon were also much better than the ones obtained from Wild Bosses. However, Shi Feng was not able to organize a twenty-man party, so it wouldn\u2019t be a disadvantage to join Gentle Snow for a round.\u201cAlright, but leave a few spots for me. Also, all Swordsman equipment and Forging Designs must belong to me,\u201d Shi Feng answered with a nod.\u201cCan\u2019t you be a little more humble?\u201d Zhao Yueru looked at Shi Feng, pouting. She felt Shi Feng was going too overboard. If Gentle Snow had asked anyone else, they would have readily agreed, even going as far as to forgo getting any equipment. Shi Feng, however, even wanted priority over equipment. He was not courteous with them at all.Gentle Snow did not imagine Shi Feng was truly different from the other people. He did not play around with his words. However, it was interesting that he would say whatever he wanted. Following which, Gentle Snow looked towards the party members behind Shi Feng. Although they were noobs, their equipment was all of good quality. They could barely manage in the twenty-man Dungeon. Thus, Gentle Snow said, \u201cFine. Let\u2019s add each other as friends then. We\u2019ll be in touch when the time comes.\u201d\u201cAlright. You can just contact me a few hours before raiding the Dungeon. I\u2019ll arrive on time.\u201d Shi Feng accepted Gentle Snow\u2019s friend request.Subsequently, Shi Feng and his party members left the small rock pit, heading towards Dark Moon Valley.When the group passed through the Deathly Forest\u2019s Dungeon, Stabbing Heart of the Assassin\u2019s Alliance abruptly called out to Shi Feng.\u201cBrother Ye Feng, I nearly failed to recognize you. I never imagined you actually knew a big shot like the Snow Goddess. You must not forget a brother like me in the future!\u201d Stabbing Heart jokingly said as he walked towards Shi Feng.\u201cNonsense. I just happen to meet with Miss Snow by chance,\u201d Shi Feng replied with a smile.\u201cBrother Ye Feng, you are too humble. Based on your strength, you are absolutely worthy of becoming friends with the Snow Goddess. After all, both of you are experts of the same level,\u201d Stabbing Heart thought Shi Feng was very humble. It was no wonder he was such a great expert. The way he conducted himself was different than ordinary people. Stabbing Heart wanted to befriend Shi Feng even more now. \u201cOur Assassin\u2019s Alliance is preparing to enter the Dungeon. I wonder if Brother Ye Feng would be interested in joining us? Of course, you can pick any of the equipment that you want.\u201d\u201cYou are too courteous, Brother Stabbing Heart. However, I still have some things to attend to. I will definitely join if there is another chance in the future,\u201d Shi Feng politely rejected the offer.Stabbing Heart spoke in a loud voice. Surrounding players clearly heard his words.At first, everyone thought of Shi Feng as just a noob. His being called upon by the Snow Goddess was just due to luck. Even now, Stabbing Heart of the Assassin\u2019s Alliance wished to befriend Shi Feng. Just what sort of situation was this?The Assassin\u2019s Alliance was a large Guild that was famous throughout White River City. As the Sub-Leader of the Guild\u2019s Elite group, Stabbing Heart would not need to interact with normal players at all. However, he tried to befriend Shi Feng. Shi Feng had actually rejected him. Shi Feng was just too domineering.If someone were to call Shi Feng a noob, nobody would believe them. There was something strange about the situation.Everyone guessed that Shi Feng must be a hidden expert that normal players did not know of. Otherwise, why would big shots try to meet Shi Feng one after the other?\u201cBoss Waving, that Stabbing Heart actually tried to befriend that noob. I\u2019m not dreaming, right?\u201d Wordless Summer Night was shocked. Was this Shi Feng really the noob they met before?Waving Slowly But Surely was currently upset in his heart. Initially, his heart still held hope that Shi Feng was just a noob. Now, however, that hope was utterly destroyed by Stabbing Heart. Shi Feng was not a noob. He was definitely an expert, just like Lonely Snow had said. Shi Feng might even be greater than Lonely Snow had described him to be. If Lonely Snow followed Shi Feng, then his future would certainly be filled with boundless prospects. On the other hand, they had chased Shi Feng away\u2026\u2026 They had missed a great chance for them to befriend an expert.\u201cBoss, why don\u2019t we go over and apologize? An expert is a magnanimous person. Who knows, he might even forgive us. At that time, we, too, could gain the favor of an expert,\u201d Battle To The End suggested.Wordless Summer Night nodded his head in complete agreement.Just as Shi Feng\u2019s party was about to leave the Deathly Forest, Waving Slowly But Surely and the others came running over.\u201cBig Brother Expert, we\u2019ve had some misunderstandings before, so we\u2019re here to apologize to you. We hope you can forgive our ignorance. Here\u2019s a Silver Coin to show our sincerity. We hope Big Brother Expert can take us under your wing,\u201d Waving Slowly was all smiles as he apologized. The arrogance he had before was completely gone now.Wordless Summer Night and Battle To The End were also sincerely apologizing without stop. They wished to grind monsters with Shi Feng.\u201cIf you guys don\u2019t have anything else to say, then please leave. I still have matters to attend to, so I don\u2019t have any time to waste with you,\u201d Shi Feng spun around to leave after replying. He did not mind one little bit in regards to Waving Slowly and the others\u2019 previous behavior. However, wanting him to carry[1] them? Not a chance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs for Lonely Snow, he only shook his head in regards to Waving Slowly and the others\u2019 actions. If they had known that their actions would lead to such results today, maybe they wouldn\u2019t have acted so in the beginning.Watching Lonely Snow leave with Shi Feng, Wordless Summer curled his lips into a frown, saying in a sour tone, \u201cBah! What\u2019s there to be amazed about?! In the future, I, too, will become an expert!\u201dHowever, only Waving Slowly knew Lonely Snow would become successful in the future. He was already in a different world than them.TL Notes:[1] carry: a gaming term used to refer to a player who largely contributed to the team\u2019s victory.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36 \u2013 Hazard GnomeAfter leaving the Deathly Forest, Shi Feng\u2019s party rushed towards Dark Moon Valley without rest.At the current stage of the game, many players had already risen to Level 2. Aside from raiding the Dungeon at the Deathly Forest, they would stay in Brook Hills to kill Level 2 Cheetah Cubs. Only a few experts would go to the Level 4 area, Dark Moon Valley, to level up. However, along with the increase in player levels, it wouldn\u2019t be long before Dark Moon Valley would become occupied.After spending over half an hour returning to Dark Moon Valley, the scene they met with was the same as what Shi Feng expected.A few Elite parties who were uninterested in the Dungeon were currently killing Level 4 Kobolds that were wandering around the outer parts of the valley. These Elite parties were quite skilled. They lured two or three monsters each time, with the Shield warrior tanking in front and preventing the Kobolds from closing in on their mage and healer. The healer was continuously healing from behind, barely maintaining the Shield Warrior\u2019s HP.Although it was taxing to grind in such a way, the gains from the fight were equally good. The three Kobolds had dropped 2 Coppers and some stone materials.In God\u2019s Domain, only monsters Level 3 and above would drop skill books and Bronze Equipment. Although the chance was only ten thousand to one, it was still enough to cause players to go on wild goose chases. Currently, Bronze Equipment was very valuable; even more so were skill books. With these enticements here, there would be many experts who would come forth, even if there was some danger involved.After taking a few glances, Shi Feng turned and left towards the inner parts of the Dark Moon Valley.The other party members who were new to the Dark Moon Valley were very nervous. It was especially true when they saw the Level 4 monsters scattered throughout the entire area. Their breaths became slightly hurried. However, Blackie was extremely calm when he saw these Level 4 Kobolds. After all, he had previously killed hundreds of them. He did not seem panicked, unlike the other party members. He simply followed Shi Feng, entering the deeper regions of the valley.As for the Elite parties, they could not help but be shocked when they saw Shi Feng\u2019s party enter deep into the valley. They had never imagined the newcomer party would have such courage.There were very few players currently present in Dark Moon Valley. It had yet to be completely developed, so there were a lot of Kobolds in the middle of the valley. The deeper one headed towards the center, the greater the number of Kobolds. There would even be groups that consisted of ten or more Kobolds. Grinding monsters there was just too dangerous. The lowest number of Kobolds they had to face was at least four or five. It was not worth risking an unwarranted death.Unfortunately, these people did not know Shi Feng was more insane than they previously thought.Shi Feng did not just enter the deeper regions of the valley. Instead, he went towards the core of the Dark Moon Valley. There was a good location to grind monsters there. Not only was there a large number of monsters, but their respawn rate was quick as well. Most importantly, the drop rate there for ore was high.Regarding understanding, Shi Feng was like the local god of the area when it came to the Dark Moon Valley. Be it the location of the monsters, the number of monsters available, or their respawn time, Shi Feng had spent countless hours researching in his previous life. His goal at that time was to increase the grinding speed of his party, all to improve his position within Shadow.Life was truly fascinating. Shi Feng\u2019s sacrifice towards Shadow in his previous life had currently turned around to help himself instead. It could increase his own party\u2019s level more quickly, while at the same time guaranteeing him a steady supply of ore.Moving along the path of broken rocks, groups of four or five Level 4 Kobolds would occasionally appear. However, it was just a small matter with the equipment of Shi Feng\u2019s party.Looking at the party\u2019s Guardian Knight, Cola, be it with HP or Defense, he could easily tank four Kobolds at the same time. The healer, Drowsy Sloth, could maintain Cola\u2019s HP above 80% without wasting much effort. If Cola had let a monster past, then Lonely Snow would go up and push it back. As for the others, they would fervently deal damage. A simple sword strike from Shi Feng could already deal over a hundred damage, whereas Blackie\u2019s Dark Arrows could each deal 88 damage. The fight could not get any easier than this.Within moments, the five Kobolds were all dealt with. Compared to the Elite party outside, Shi Feng\u2019s party was stronger by several folds.Shi Feng simply picked up the stone materials and ore that dropped, then continuing deeper into the Dark Moon Valley.After spending over an hour moving forward, Shi Feng\u2019s party had finally arrived in front of a mountain. The massive mountain was hundreds of meters in height. Kobolds no longer filled the area surrounding the mountain; Wandering Gnomes had replaced them. These Wandering Gnomes each held a small shovel in their hands, using it to dig into the rock wall of the mountain. There were also quite a few Gnome Overseers that inspected the surrounding areas with a whip in hand.\u201cBrother Feng, the monsters here are just too numerous. Are we really going to grind here?\u201dBlackie\u2019s heart shook slightly when he took a look around. He discovered hundreds of Wandering Gnomes around the vast mountain. There was even a few Level 5 Gnome Overseers. Compared to the groups of over ten Kobolds outside, this place was a literal battlefield.Cola also gulped down a mouthful of saliva, worriedly saying, \u201cParty leader, I\u2019m not trying to boast, but tanking six or seven of them is my limit. I really can\u2019t manage this many monsters.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just Blackie or Cola. The others, as well, were apprehensive. Wandering Gnomes occupied the entire mountain, and these Gnomes were very close to each other. As long as they made a mistake while luring, then they would have to face-off against hundreds of Level 4 monsters. Such a large number of monsters was much scarier than the Lord-rank Felt.\u201cI know you guys can\u2019t fend all of them off. However, who ever said about letting any of you tank hundreds of Gnomes?\u201d Shi Feng rolled his eyes at his party members. He was extremely clear regarding the party\u2019s standards. Facing off against ten Gnomes at the same time was nearly their limit, so how could they deal with hundreds at the same time?Even a Level 10 player would be finished when met with hundreds if Level 4 monsters.However, wasn\u2019t there a good saying that stated: \u201cif you can\u2019t outfight them, outrun them\u201d?Shi Feng\u2019s Agility had reached 30 points. Including the Bronze Shoes he had, his Movement Speed had exceeded the Wandering Gnomes by at least 4 points. He could easily kite the Gnomes and let Blackie use the AOE skill, Hell Flame. The efficiency of grinding in such a way was several times greater than that of killing individually.Following which, Shi Feng told everyone about his plan. He needed Blackie to get the timing right, maximizing the effect of Hell Flame. As for the others, they were responsible for taking out the Gnomes with low HP.When Shi Feng had chosen his position, he grabbed a handful of stones and rushed towards the nearby Gnome Overseer.Just as Shi Feng approached the 20-yard distance, the Overseer had started yelling loudly. Its screams attracted the attention of many of the surrounding Wandering Gnomes. Shi Feng waited first for a moment, avoiding the whip of the Gnome Overseer and allowing the Wandering Gnomes to continuously gather.When about 30 Gnomes had gathered, Shi Feng turned around and ran in the opposite direction. Afterward, he threw a small stone that struck another Gnome Overseer. The Overseer who was struck loudly bellowed, bringing along over twenty of its brethren and rushing at Shi Feng.Within moments, Shi Feng had lured over sixty monsters. However, Shi Feng was not yet satisfied. He started circling the mountain as he lured monsters, and within five minutes, there were hundreds of Wandering Gnomes and more than ten Gnome Overseers chasing behind him with all their might.Unfortunately for them, Shi Feng\u2019s equipment was just too good. His speed was 30% greater when compared to the Gnomes. Including Shi Feng\u2019s extraordinary techniques and control over his body, he was able to toy with the Gnomes whichever way he wanted.\u201cBlackie, get ready to cast,\u201d Shi Feng reminded.\u201cAlright.\u201d Blackie was extremely excited. This was his first time using AOE magic, so he did not know what kind of effects it would have.Subsequently, Blackie\u2019s fingers started gesturing in midair. Brilliant magical seals started appearing, forming into a dazzling magic circle that gave off a peerless aura.As Blackie spat out the last syllable, the land shook. Jade green flames rushed to the sky, devouring the entire Gnome army. A field of damages over a hundred had appeared. Within five seconds, every Gnome chasing after Shi Feng received over two hundred damage, their remaining HP less than half.However, the target of these Gnomes had also changed. They no longer went after Shi Feng, but Blackie instead.Shi Feng abruptly stopped. He pulled out the Abyssal Blade and rushed forward.Thundering Flash!Not only did the Level 4 Thundering Flash have a low Cooldown, but its attack range also increased to 15 by 3 yards. It had nearly covered the entire Gnome army.Three streaks of thunder flew past the Gnome army, creating three damages of over 120 points to every Gnome. The attack had completely devoured the remaining HP of the Gnomes. As for the low HP ones that remained, they were quickly held back by Cola. Lonely Snow then rushed forward and used a Whirlwind Slash, thoroughly ending the remaining Gnomes.The hundreds of Gnomes had been wiped out, leaving behind a floor covered with items.Meanwhile, everyone\u2019s experience madly rose. EXP of over ten points appeared one after the other, dazzling everyone\u2019s eyes.Hua! Blackie had risen to Level 3.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis is too awesome!\u201d Blackie roared in exhilaration.\u201cThis is only the beginning. They will still respawn in a moment.\u201d Shi Feng laughed, \u201cLet\u2019s quickly pick up the drops.\u201dSuddenly, everyone started busying themselves. Even with six people retrieving the drops, the loot of hundreds of Gnomes still required them to spend a lot of time doing so.However, moments after they started collecting, a Gnome that piloted a gigantic robot suddenly appeared. The Gnome\u2019s face was crimson red. It immediately rushed towards Shi Feng\u2019s party with unparalleled rage.\u201cNot good! It\u2019s the Hazard Gnome! Everyone spread out!\u201d Shi Feng shouted the moment he laid eyes on the gigantic robot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37 \u2013 Rocket BootsThe moment everyone saw the giant robot piloted by a midget Gnome, they instinctively knew he was something very dangerous. After hearing Shi Feng\u2019s reminder, they ignored the loot on the ground and immediately ran towards the forest without a shred of hesitation.Naturally, Shi Feng would not stay behind either.The Hazard Gnome was a very dangerous monster. It was especially true when he first made his appearance. He was even stronger than Werewolf Felt with its Death Berserk activated.[Hazard Gnome] (Special Elite)Level 5HP 1600/1600There was a very small chance for the Hazard Gnome to appear after clearing out the Wandering Gnomes and Gnome Overseers. However, his appearance also signified the start of a player\u2019s nightmare.There was a saying in God\u2019s Domain that warns people not to look down on Gnomes just because they were midgets. If they were enraged, they could easily extinguish your life at any given moment.In his previous life, Shi Feng met the Hazard Gnome once before. At that time, he was with an Elite party who was grinding for ore. After killing the Gnomes, the Hazard Gnome appeared. They did not imagine they would meet a Special Elite, so they had all excitedly rushed at him. However, the situation ended up in a tragedy for the twenty-man party.The Hazard Gnome\u2019s 1600 HP must not be taken lightly. His Defense was an abnormality, capable of reducing 80% of the damage he received. A Level 4 Berserker using an ax could only take 2 HP from the Gnome. On the other hand, the Hazard Gnome\u2019s attacks were even more powerful. Everyone would get a free trip back to the city after he fired a burst of bullets.Although Shi Feng\u2019s party had tried their best to run away, the Hazard Gnome\u2019s hatred for their evil deeds was clearly implacable. The rockets on the robot\u2019s back suddenly ignited. The steel machine that was over three meters tall rushed at high speed towards Shi Feng\u2019s party.While being chased, Blackie attacked with his Dark Arrow as he ran.Although the arrow had struck the Hazard Gnome, it had only caused a meager -4 damage.Blackie\u2019s eyes widened when he saw the damage. He said in a dumbstruck manner, \u201cDisgusting! If the robot wasn\u2019t protecting this Gnome, I could one-shot him anytime!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mind it for now and focus on running. Pay attention to dodging the bullets. As long as we are 1200 yards away from the mountain, the Hazard Gnome will return.\u201d Shi Feng never thought, just after a lecture from him, Blackie\u2019s skill would improve to the degree of being able to hit his target while moving. However, fighting head-on with the Hazard Gnome would be very foolish.Blackie understood Shi Feng\u2019s intentions. He turned around and started chanting Evil Whip, binding the pursuing Hazard Gnome with five thorns and greatly reducing the Gnome\u2019s speed. With this, everyone managed to gain quite a distance from the Gnome.When the Hazard Gnome broke free from the five thorns, high damages of -23, -24, -23, -23, -24 suddenly appeared on his head. His HP had turned to 1479 within an instant.The damage caused by the Evil Whip was just ridiculous.Blackie was shocked. Before, his Level 3 Dark Arrow had only dealt -4 damage. On the other hand, the Evil Whip had caused over a hundred damage total. The difference between them was just too great. Did the Hazard Gnome have that kind of fetish?Shi Feng saw hope when the Hazard Gnome\u2019s HP suddenly fell by a portion. The Hazard Gnome did not have any immunity towards plant-based attacks. Shi Feng immediately commanded, \u201cEverybody stop running. Cola, get the Hazard Gnome\u2019s Hatred and let his back face toward the group. The others attack and mind your positions. As long as the Hazard Gnome lifts up his gun, immediately dodge the muzzle. Blackie, attack immediately after Evil Whip\u2019s CD finishes. We have a chance to get rid of him.\u201dWhether they would live or die before they ran out of the 1200-yard mark was an uncertainty. So, why not fight it out? Who knows, they might even be able to get rid of this Hazard Gnome.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, there were no players who killed the Hazard Gnome before. If they were to kill him now, something good might drop.Currently, the Hazard Gnome\u2019s Hatred was targeted towards Blackie. However, Lonely Snow was a step ahead of the Gnome, using Charge on him. He used a Whirlwind Slash on the Gnome, causing 3 points of damage.Although the damage was low, the momentary Fainted state it caused gave Cola a chance to use Divine Strike, followed by Punishment. The two attacks caused -3, -2 damage and the additional Hatred they attracted had the Hazard Gnome locked onto Cola.The Hazard Gnome extended the electric saw on the robot\u2019s right arm, violently slashing at Cola. Cola blocked the attack with his shield; his body retreated three steps backward and a damage of -147 appearing above his head. Cola was shocked. When the next attack from the electric saw came, he hurriedly dodged and rolled to the side, avoiding the attack completely. Drowsy Sloth immediately healed Cola twice, returning close to a hundred HP to Cola.\u201cSuch fierce damage,\u201d Lonely Snow was shocked as well. He no longer dared to stay, turning around and running more than ten yards away from the Gnome. He would definitely die, even if he were only struck once by the electric saw.On the other hand, Shi Feng was not afraid of him. He immediately arrived at the Hazard Gnome\u2019s back, using out a series of skills: Thundering Flash, Double Chop, and Chop. The occasional critical hit would also cause -16 damage. Compared to the others, Shi Feng\u2019s damage was already very high.However, the Hazard Gnome only gave a look of contempt towards Shi Feng\u2019s attacks. He continued using his electric saw to attack Cola.A series of fierce attacks had forced Cola to constantly retreat backward; his HP was continuously falling as well. Behind, Drowsy Sloth\u2019s healing could not keep up with the damage Cola was receiving. He could only watch as Cola inched closer to death.At the most crucial moment, Shi Feng used Abyssal Bind. Nine pitch-black chains bound the Hazard Gnome, giving Cola a breather.Within the three seconds[1], the Hazard Gnome had only lost 7% of his HP after being barraged by everyone\u2019s attacks. The total damage the party dealt was not even the equivalent of a single Evil Whip from Blackie.When the three seconds had ended, the Hazard Gnome regained his freedom. The green-skinned Gnome revealed a mocking smile on his face, his tiny hands moving around and manipulating buttons. The robot\u2019s arm holding the electric saw made a roundabout slash, creating a beautiful arc. Shi Feng\u2019s entire person was sent flying. He smashed into a tree and lost 286 HP.Cola rushed up in a hurry, his HP having recovered by more than half. He used Divine Strike and Punishment once again, trying to pull back the Hazard Gnome\u2019s Hatred.However, the Hazard Gnome had actually ignored Cola. Instead, he lifted the gun in his left hand, aimed it and fired a burst of bullets at Shi Feng.A barrage of densely packed bullets flew towards Shi Feng. However, Shi Feng had yet to land after being sent flying, so it was impossible to dodge the bullets.Phantom Kill!Shi Feng\u2019s doppelganger instantly appeared before him. The doppelganger waved his blade, continuously blocking the bullets. Meanwhile, Shi Feng had already activated Gravity Liberation. He jumped up to a treetop, avoiding the attack range of the Hazard Gnome. However, his doppelganger had already been killed.After finishing a cartridge of bullets, the Hazard Gnome started changing magazines. Afterward, he continued to rush at Shi Feng. Everyone else could only continue attacking, shaving away the Hazard Gnome\u2019s HP bit by bit.However, Shi Feng was not easy to hit after he activated Gravity Liberation. Shi Feng also used the trees for protection. He was barely dodging the flying bullets as he continued kiting the Gnome.As for Blackie, he would immediately use Evil Whip as soon as it was ready.The Hazard Gnome\u2019s HP continuously fell, 64%\u2026 50%\u2026 30%\u2026 20%\u2026 10%.When only 10% of the Hazard Gnome\u2019s HP remained, the Gnome suddenly jumped out of the metallic machine. He wore a pair of Rocket Boots and started to escape.\u201cIt can\u2019t be\u2026 Monsters can actually escape?\u201d Blackie watched as the Hazard Gnome ran, with extreme speed, to a location without people.The others were also shocked. They never imagined the Gnome would have such a high intelligence. He ran the moment he knew he could not win the fight.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWe can\u2019t let him escape! We will have fought for nothing otherwise!\u201d Cola immediately chased after the Gnome. He had been bullied by the Hazard Gnome just a moment ago, so his heart was currently filled with anger. How could he let the Hazard Gnome escape after having taken advantage of them?\u201cYou want to escape? Not a chance!\u201d Shi Feng chased after him with Wind Blade.However, the Hazard Gnome was unperturbed. He sent Shi Feng a mocking expression before pressing a button on his waist. The Rocket Boots spewed out large amounts of flames, ready to fly away.TL Notes:[1] Within three seconds: The effective duration of Abyssal Bind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Its human-like expressions and actions were completely different from NPCs. The Hazard Gnome was like a person pretending to be an NPC.Two streaks of crimson flame flared, slowly lifting the Hazard Gnome into the air.Unwillingness filled everyone\u2019s hearts. However, they could no longer stop it, but only watch the Hazard Gnome flee with their own eyes. The mages in the party were over 40 yards away from the Hazard Gnome. Lonely Snow as well was over 30 yards apart from it. It was not within the range of Charge. Also, the Faint effect of Charge would become ineffective because the target was floating in midair. Only the Movement Speed increase would take effect.Currently, only Shi Feng was close to the Hazard Gnome. He was only 15 yards away from it. However, Shi Feng did not have any range attacks. Even if he chased after it, the Hazard Gnome would raise over 20 yards from the ground by the time he arrived. In the end, Shi Feng would only watch the Hazard Gnome escape.Nine Dragons Slash!Shi Feng knew he could not catch up. He waved the Abyssal Blade, shrouded in black mist, in his hand. Within an instant, nine streaks of black mist shot towards the Hazard Gnome. Shi Feng was not willing to allow such a smart Hazard Gnome leave.Initially, Shi Feng only thought of the Hazard Gnome as an average Special Elite. He had never imagined the Gnome to be so much like a player.Throughout his ten years of playing God\u2019s Domain, Shi Feng rarely saw such intelligent Gnomes. The Main God System wouldn\u2019t simply bestow a small monster with high intelligence. Such bestowals usually had a deeper meaning behind them. For example, those human Heroes or legendary beings were all great characters. Their existences caused people to shudder.Although the intelligence of this Hazard Gnome did not reach the level of those Heroes or legendary beings, he was still much smarter than a Boss monster. There might even be unimaginable gains by killing it.Currently, the Hazard Gnome\u2019s displayed information changed. He suddenly became Arcus Maddox.[Arcus Maddox] (Lord-rank)Level 5HP 600/600Shi Feng felt a sense of familiarity when he saw this name. It seems that he had heard of it before, yet he could not recall anything about it.However, the Gnome only had 600 HP. Shi Feng was confident he could kill the Gnome with the Nine Dragons Slash.Just when the nine sword shadows were about to pierce Arcus Maddox, the Gnome took out a few steel balls from his small bag. He threw the balls at the phantoms of the Abyssal Blade.Brilliant sparks flared up the moment the two attacks came into contact.Hong\u2026 Hong\u2026 Hong\u2026A series of explosions forced the phantoms of the Abyssal Blade back. Just when the phantoms were prepared to attack Arcus Maddox once more, he immediately flew over 30 yards away. Meanwhile, the nine phantoms of the Abyssal Blade could only attack targets within 30 yards of its reach.Shi Feng could only watch helplessly as Arcus Maddox escaped.\u201cCrap. How could there be such a monster? His escaping ability is just a Bug[1]!\u201d Blackie stared at the fleeing Arcus Maddox as he cursed.Cola was grinding his teeth in hatred as well, sending a few punches towards a nearby tree.The other party members felt displeasure also.Everyone fought long and hard against this Elite monster. However, just when they were about to reap the rewards of their efforts, their prize grew wings and flew away. Was there anything more depressing?\u201cBrother Feng, let\u2019s continue chasing it.\u201d Blackie discovered that the Gnome\u2019s Movement Speed was not fast. Also, there should be a limited amount of fuel powering that pair of boots. Who knows; the Gnome might land just after awhile.\u201cForget it. Let\u2019s continue grinding Gnomes.\u201d Shi Feng shook his head. If they could chase the Gnome, Shi Feng would have long since chased after it. However, the Gnome\u2019s Rocket Boots were just too powerful. It was titled as one of God\u2019s Domain\u2019s godly escape tools. Currently, the boots had just been activated. Its speed would abruptly increase in a moment, and the Gnome would disappear in the blink of an eye. It would be an impossible task if they wished to find the Gnome.As expected, the flames gushing out from the Rocket Boots greatly increased after a moment. Xiu! Arcus Maddox disappeared from the air, unable to be seen anymore.\u201cBest not let us meet again. You can dream of escaping the next time.\u201d Blackie said in an unfortunate tone as he looked towards the spot where Arcus Maddox had disappeared.In his heart, Shi Feng felt that it was a pity to let the Gnome go. However, it would no longer be dangerous when they grinded on Wandering Gnomes from now on. After this experience, the Hazard Gnome most likely would not show himself ever again.\u201cLet\u2019s go, continue grinding on the Wandering Gnomes.\u201d Shi Feng turned around and said to his party.\u201cBrother Feng, you\u2019re still the best! How could I not think of it? If we killed all of this bastard\u2019s kinsmen, we\u2019ll see if he doesn\u2019t show up again.\u201d Blackie laughingly said.Shi Feng was speechless. He turned around and left, no longer paying any attention to the fantasizing Blackie.Suddenly, Shi Feng stopped his feet in shock.\u201cDamn, our luck really is too poor! I never thought that Arcus Maddox would actually appear here, and he was also a Level 5 Hazard Gnome!\u201d Shi Feng tightly clenched his fists, his brows wrinkled. It was the first time he became so enraged.When everyone looked at Shi Feng\u2019s wrathful expression, they could faintly feel the surroundings become chilly. They could not help but retreat a step; their foreheads covered in a cold sweat. Before, they felt Shi Feng was a calm and easygoing person. Never would they have imagined Shi Feng would become so terrifying after becoming angry.The forest around them no longer seemed lively but more like a frozen hell, silent, cold, and dark.\u201cBrother Feng\u2026\u2026 are you alright?\u201d Blackie carefully asked. He was shocked. Shi Feng was completely different from when he was mad or arguing with others. It was the first time Blackie saw Shi Feng enraged to such a degree.\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Shi Feng reacted, replying with a smile. He stored back the dense killing intent into his heart. Such killing intent was slowly honed throughout the years Shi Feng had played God\u2019s Domain. Compared to the Tyrant Bear Cola of ten years in the future, there was nothing special about Shi Feng\u2019s killing intent. However, at present, it was considered unbearable for Blackie and the others.Shi Feng finally recalled the name of Arcus Maddox.Arcus Maddox was a famous Grandmaster Engineer within God\u2019s Domain. Three years after Arcus Maddox shocked the nation by creating the sky fortress, \u2018Twin Snake Ring,\u2019 he had gone on to establish the Gnome Empire. With it, the new update \u2018Emergence of the New World\u2019 also activated. At that time, countless Super-Guilds started expeditions towards the fortress, \u2018Twin Snake Ring.\u2019 However, all of them were annihilated, and Arcus Maddox was the cause of such a result.On the other hand, Shi Feng was completely unaware of a great character had appeared right before his eyes. He also lost the chance to kill Arcus Maddox, so how could Shi Feng not be enraged?\u201cParty leader, there\u2019s a box here. Did it drop from Arcus Maddox during the explosions?\u201d Gluttonous Mouse, who had been silent all this while, asked as he picked up a small metallic box from the grass.Shi Feng received the box and took a look at it. He discovered the words Arcus Maddox carved onto the metallic box. Shortly after Shi Feng opened the box, he said suddenly with a laugh, \u201cGreat! Good job, Mouse! With this, we didn\u2019t fight for nothing after all.\u201dWhen the group saw Shi Feng in a happy mood, they knew the item must be very precious, as common items were nothing in Shi Feng\u2019s eyes.As to wanting the item for themselves, none of them ever had such thoughts. They had long since made Shi Feng their idol, and being able to aid their idol naturally made them happy.\u201cLet\u2019s do it this way. You guys stay here to grind and level up. I still have something that needs to be done. Notify me when you have all reached Level 4.\u201d Shi Feng kept the metallic box and hastily made the arrangements. Nobody could help him with the following matter. Only Shi Feng was able to proceed.Everyone felt reluctant when they heard Shi Feng\u2019s command. However, hearing Shi Feng have plans for them after they reached Level 4, their anticipation grew as they abided Shi Feng\u2019s arrangements.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSubsequently, Shi Feng left the deeper regions of the Dark Moon Valley.The party had Blackie\u2019s AOE skill. Killing seven or eight Gnomes at a time was no problem at all, and their leveling speed was at least two or three times faster than the other parties.On the other hand, what Shi Feng needed to do was to utilize this metallic box, and to forward the first step of his plans in God\u2019s Domain.TL Notes:[1] Bug: A fault in the game that causes unexpected results when an action is carried out within the game.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had also activated Gravity Liberation to save more time.The players on their way to the Dark Moon Valley saw Shi Feng speeding past them like a gale of win. His speed was shockingly fast, and his figure was just a blur.\u201cWho is that person? Which Assassin is he? His speed is so fast!\u201d\u201cNo, look at his waist. That\u2019s a sword hanging there, not a dagger. He should be a Swordsman.\u201d\u201cCrap. Are the current Swordsmen that OP? The widely spread rumor on the forums stated that a mysterious Swordsman killed the Mayor of Red Leaf Town. There was also a powerful Swordsman at the Deathly Forest that received an invitation from the Snow Goddess. I would have played as a Swordsman if I had known about this earlier!\u201d\u201cSay, do you think they\u2019re the same person?\u201d\u201cDefinitely not. I saw the Swordsman that killed the Mayor. That male Swordsman was as big as a black bear. His arms alone were thicker than our thighs. He had forcefully killed that Level 15 Mayor.\u201dThe players passing by started a discussion as they watched Shi Feng depart. They were inwardly speechless towards the Swordsman Job. They should have played as Swordsmen if there was such a powerful Job. However, it was too late now.Shi Feng might have laughed it off if he had known their thoughts. There was no strongest Job in God\u2019s Domain, only the strongest player.Shi Feng ran for over two hours through the vast plains. He activated Gravity Liberation over tens of times, escaping the pursuit of high-leveled monsters. He passed through the Level 6 map, Wolfman\u2019s Ruins, and the Level 8 map, Oro Fort, before arriving in the Level 10 area, Scarlet Lake.Scarlet Lake was the playground of Level 10 Water Elementals and Little Fishmen. Watching from a high location, Shi Feng could see groups of Little Fishmen patrolling. The closer it was to the Scarlet Lake, the more there were of Little Fishmen. The central region of the Scarlet Lake was the nest of the Little Fishmen, whereas annoying Water Elementals filled the water of the lake.Due to the densely packed and large number of monsters in the Scarlet Lake, the Little Fishmen\u2019s curse skill was extremely horrendous. It could absorb a player\u2019s Attributes and turned it into their own. The longer they fought, the stronger they would become. They were extremely hard to kill. Including the fact that there were no Quests here, there were rarely any players who would willingly come here to level up.However, Shi Feng had to enter into the deeper regions of the Scarlet Lake.The metal box dropped by Arcus Maddox was extremely precious. If Arcus Maddox were to know it fell into Shi Feng\u2019s hands, he would most likely bleed out in rage. There was a treasure map inside the box, and the treasure it hid was located at Scarlet Lake.Shi Feng had played God\u2019s Domain for over ten years now. He had done extensive research regarding the history of God\u2019s Domain.He truly did not think Arcus Maddox would have this treasure map. It was the record of a heaven-shaking secret.Nine hundred years ago, Alchemy Master Molotov had created an item with all his effort. Wars were waged between the large countries in God\u2019s Domain for this item. There were over ten heroic figures that fought over it. However, this item became lost in the end, its whereabouts unknown. It had become an unsolved mystery in God\u2019s Domain.Meanwhile, the treasure map in Shi Feng\u2019s hands, by chance, recorded the location of this item.This item was the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.It was a sacred item for Alchemy. If Alchemists could obtain the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, then they would have the ability to transform stone into gold, amassing immense wealth. They would even be able to revive the dead, breaking the alchemy law of equivalent exchange.Who would have thought such a sacred item would be placed in such an unremarkable location as Scarlet Lake.However, the Scarlet Lake was still a dangerous place for Shi Feng. After all was said, there was still a gap of 8 Levels between Shi Feng and the monsters here. With the suppression due to levels, Shi Feng was not an opponent for the Level 10 monsters, not to mention the Attribute-stealing Little Fishmen.However, Shi Feng could not help but take the risk. The earlier he obtained the Philosopher\u2019s Stone; the earlier his heart could be at ease. If he waited until he was Level 7 or 8, someone else might claim the item. He wouldn\u2019t even be able to feel regret when that time came.Shi Feng took out the metal box from his bag, carefully taking out the treasure map within it. He started researching it in detail.The marking on the treasure map was very clear. The treasure was located directly below the Little Fishmen\u2019s nest. However, how would Shi Feng be able to circle around all these Little Fishmen? The problem with the Water Elementals also needed to be solved. Although Water Elementals had low HP, they had a 60% immunity to physical attacks. They also had a Movement Speed reduction skill, so they were a headache for melee players.After observing for half an hour, Shi Feng discovered that the Little Fishmen were not always on patrol. They would eventually take a break. Also, these Little Fishmen were only active by the lake\u2019s shores. They hardly ever entered the water, because once they entered it, their Movement Speed would sharply reduce by 60%. Shi Feng could use this short rest period to rush into the lake, and once he was in it, the Little Fishmen would not be able to chase after him.As for the Water Elementals under the water, Shi Feng could use the doppelganger of Phantom Kill to lure them away. Then, he could swim to the cavern below the Little Fishmen\u2019s nest.If Shi Feng did not operate through his plan properly, he would definitely die. If he died, his losses would not be minor. It was not the experience loss that was a problem, however. With his advantage as a reincarnated person, Shi Feng could quickly recuperate the experience he lost. Only, he would be sent back to the town after dying once, and the time he would waste by returning here was just too much.\u201cTen more seconds.\u201d Shi Feng watched the patrolling Little Fishmen, his heart estimating the time for him to sprint out.Time passed second after second. A group of patrolling Fishmen watched their surroundings. After discovering nothing out of the ordinary, they entered a small wooden hut by the lake to rest, emptying the land by the lake.With all his might, Shi Feng dashed towards the shore.When Shi Feng was about 30 yards away from the lake, another group of patrolling Fishmen discovered Shi Feng. They immediately sounded out an alarm, their hands wielding short swords as they rushed toward Shi Feng.When faced with four Level 10 Little Fishman, as powerful as Shi Feng was, he was not their match. Shi Feng\u2019s only hope was to jump into the water.However, the Little Fishmen were very quick, taking only a short moment to catch up to Shi Feng. They waved their short swords, slashing them at Shi Feng\u2019s back.Shi Feng knew he could not outrun the Fishmen. He turned around and used Abyssal Bind on one of them, then continued by using Parry to block another one of his attackers. As a result, Shi Feng stopped the other Little Fishmen from moving forward.Using the power behind the Fishman\u2019s attack, Shi Feng managed to pull away a distance of over three yards. He activated Gravity Liberation and then jumped onto the lake.However, the other Little Fishmen were quick to catch up, jumping into the lake after Shi Feng as well.Plop.Four Little Fishmen fell into the water. Shi Feng however, was madly running above the lake\u2019s surface.[Walking On Water] was a skill that could only be activated after Agility reached 80 points. However, Shi Feng had the Ring Of Gravity. As a result, his body had reached a state of near-weightlessness after activating Gravity Liberation. Including his Agility that was over 30 points, he, too, could move on the water\u2019s surface. His speed would not be reduced by the water.In a few moments, Shi Feng had shaken off the unyielding Little Fishmen. He ran to a location not far from the Little Fishmen\u2019s nest, diving into the water.Just after entering the water, Shi Feng discovered a cavern that was surrounded by a lot of Water Elementals. The Water Elementals were encircling around the cavern as if they were protecting something.[Water Elemental] (Common monster)Level 10HP 750/750Shi Feng used Phantom Kill. His doppelganger swam over, luring the Water Elementals.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJust as Shi Feng planned, a group of Water Elementals had discovered the doppelganger. One after another, they chased after the doppelganger. Meanwhile, the doppelganger swam upwards. Although the Water Elementals had high Movement Speed under water, it was an entirely different story when they were above ground. They were the opposite of the Little Fishmen, becoming extremely slow once they reached the shore.With the Water Elementals lured away by his doppelganger, Shi Feng took the chance to quickly swim towards the cavern.Before Shi Feng even reached the cavern, the system notified him of the death of his doppelganger. The doppelganger had only earned Shi Feng over 20 seconds.After killing the doppelganger, the Water Elementals discovered an intruder near the cavern. They all hurriedly swam back to the cavern entrance.After discovering Shi Feng, the speed of these Water Elementals increased by a fold as they sped towards Shi Feng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They screamed and bellowed, each of them holding weapons as they jumped into the water and swam towards the cavern below the nest.\u201cDual layered protection?\u201d Shi Feng took a look behind him, shocked.As if hundreds of Water Elementals were not enough, now there were also hundreds of Little Fishmen following behind. With this amount, even two or three Elite groups of players would not amount to anything.Shi Feng had no choice but to increase his speed and rush into the cave. There was still a thread of hope for survival.However, Shi Feng\u2019s speed underwater was very slow. It was incomparable to the Druids who had their Seal Transformation, where their Movement Speed was increased by 50% when moving underwater. Instead, Shi Feng\u2019s Movement Speed was reduced by 50%.Soon, Shi Feng was just 50 yards away from the cavern\u2019s entrance. However, the enraged Water Elementals approached Shi Feng as if they were flying, their distance between Shi Feng shortening quickly.42 yards\u2026 28 yards\u2026 20 yards\u2026 10 yards\u2026Just when Shi Feng was only 5 yards away from the cavern entrance, the Water Elementals had caught up with Shi Feng. They waved their gigantic icy fists towards Shi Feng\u2019s head.The attacks from Water Elementals carried a Freezing effect that reduced Movement Speed. As long as they hit Shi Feng, the Water Elementals would cling to him till death.Shi Feng hurriedly spun around and used Parry, blocking the fist of the first Water Elemental. Using the Water Elemental\u2019s immense strength, Shi Feng\u2019s body retreated backward by quite a distance. However, the remaining Water Elementals also rushed at him.\u201cIt seems I\u2019ll be going back to town.\u201d Shi Feng looked at the hundreds of Water Elementals in front of him, feeling powerless.Just when Shi Feng was about to give up, he had floated into the cavern. Inside, he saw a human-shaped ghost roaming about. It was roughly thirty yards away from Shi Feng.Shi Feng gave caution to the wind. If he had to die, then he would die trying. At the very least, he could obtain a little more information for future preparations. Hence, Shi Feng used Wind Blade, his speed increasing by a large leap. Like a gale, Shi Feng swept through the water and rushed to the shore of the cavern, escaping the clutches of the Water Elementals just in the nick of time. The moment the Water Elementals left the water, their speed was sharply reduced. They could not catch up to Shi Feng\u2019s mad dash at all.After leaving the water, Shi Feng quickly rushed towards the human-shaped ghost. The moment the Abyssal Blade was about to slash across the ghost\u2019s neck, Shi Feng suddenly discovered the half-transparent ghost did not actively attack him.Shi Feng abruptly turned the tip of his sword away, the blade sliding past the ghost\u2019s side. It did not attract the ghost\u2019s Hatred.\u201cClose one,\u201d Shi Feng felt cold sweat down his back when he looked at the ghost\u2019s information.[Brave One, Floyd]. (High Lord)Level 25HP 360,000/360,000If Shi Feng had attacked this Brave One and attracted his Hatred, even if he had a hundred lives, he would still end up dead.Within God\u2019s Domain, Brave Ones were only second to Heroes regarding strength. Their position within a kingdom was even higher than that of a Marquis and was second only to a Duke. Even if such a great character had died and turned into a ghost, he was still a monster of the Great Lord rank. He was a tyrant amongst monsters.Without a hundred-men group of Elite players, it was impossible to kill off this ghost.Could he be the guardian of this place? Shi Feng looked at the Brave One, Floyd, silently guessing in his heart.There were usually guards posted around places with treasure. As for the Little Fishmen and Water Elementals outside, they could be considered, at most, as guard dogs. They were unfit to guard an important treasure.Shi Feng did not dare to stay any longer. After all, there was still a large group of monsters chasing after him. He hurriedly ran towards the inner regions of the cavern.The cavern was very large. There was a flight of stairs that led straight into the depths of the cavern and following it down ought to lead Shi Feng to the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.When Shi Feng was right before the stairs, a sea of Water Elementals and Little Fishmen had rushed at him. It was as if they had an undying grudge against him.\u201cYou lower lifeforms dare to sully this divine place? Prepare to receive divine punishment!\u201d Floyd\u2019s gaze suddenly erupted in rage, pulling out a dark golden greatsword from his back. The sword gave out a surge of evil that made it seem as if it were the master of the world.When Floyd raised the greatsword, the surrounding air started becoming heavy.Following which, Floyd gave out a loud bellow as his arms swung the greatsword with all their might. A strong wind, followed by a sword flash swept through all the Water Elementals and Little Fishmen. Each and every one of the monsters turned into ash, and the cavern\u2019s entrance instantly transformed into a pile of rubble.\u201cStrong!\u201d Shi Feng exclaimed in shock.He had sorely underestimated the strength of a Brave One. Floyd\u2019s single sword could easily wipe out a hundred-men group of Level 30 Elite players. A three hundred-men group might be needed to even have a fighting chance.It was unexpected that the Water Elementals and Little Fishmen did not even have the right to become guard dogs. They were all annihilated in an instant.Shi Feng wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead. Luckily, he was a human and not a lower lifeform. Otherwise, his outcome would be similar to those Water Elementals and Little Fishmen.\u201cThis place is truly vicious. I guess I can only go downward now.\u201d Shi Feng looked at the collapsed entrance. Not even an earthworm could find a way through the debris.The stairs that led down were spiral-shaped. The rocky walls surrounding it were also enchanted with a kind of light-based magic, brightening the entire stairwell. However, this stairwell was extremely long. Fortunately, there were no dangers here. After walking for an entire half an hour, Shi Feng finally arrived at the end of the stairwell, at the beginning of a wide and spacious hall.The hall was about the size of an entire football field, and it looked similar to a shrine of sorts. Made out of gold and jade, the two sides of the hall were carved with an abundance of illustrations and texts. There was also an altar at the deepest part of the shrine; above the altar was a treasure chest made of pure gold. On each side of the treasure chest, there were two statues made of gold, both of them holding a greatsword in their hands.System: Player has discovered the Sun Temple.\u201cSun Temple?\u201d It was the first time Shi Feng had heard this name. In his previous life, there was no information on the Sun Temple. It might have been because no player had activated it before, so there was no information about it on the official website. However, looking at the situation, it should be very dangerous.However, Shi Feng couldn\u2019t care less about it as he walked towards the golden altar. His target was the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, and the golden chest before his eyes should be holding the item.The moment Shi Feng stepped onto the altar, he clearly felt a chill permeating his body. The chilliness came from the two gigantic golden statues. Shi Feng did not know what sort of consequences there would be if he continued onwards to retrieve the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.However, he no longer had any choice. The cavern\u2019s entrance had already been sealed off, so he could only decide after grabbing the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.Shi Feng slowly opened the golden treasure chest. Golden rays of light leaked out from the chest, illuminating the entire temple. Subsequently, the golden rays started to fade, revealing three items inside the chest. Shi Feng pocketed the items with zero hesitation.\u201cCrap, how could the Philosopher\u2019s Stone end up in such a state?\u201d Shi Feng looked at the thumb-sized blood-red stone, feeling extremely disappointed.[Philosopher\u2019s Stone] (Damaged)Epic-rank Special Item (Dropped after death)A sacred item for Alchemy, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone can be used to turn stone into gold, revive the dead, and has many more unfathomable uses. However, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone was damaged and broken into five pieces by the Sword Emperor, Knight. Nevertheless, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone possesses immense strength. As long as the five pieces are gathered, it will be able to recover all of its strength.Active Effect: Due to being damaged, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone possesses less than a tenth of its original strength. It is only possible to use it for Alchemy Conversion and Elemental Refinement.Although the effects were greatly reduced, Shi Feng was still satisfied with it. These two abilities would enable Shi Feng to accomplish a lot.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs for the remaining two items, one of them was the [Golden Greatsword], a Level 10 Fine-Gold Weapon. The other item was an [Instantaneous Movement] Magic Scroll.\u201cA great treasure indeed.\u201d Shi Feng looked at the Golden Greatsword in his hands with extreme excitement. Aside from Magic Weapons, it was the best item a Level 10 player could have. If a Level 10 player were to equip this greatsword, they could definitely become invincible amongst players of the same Level.At this moment the two statues by the side shook. Their eyes released a red glow, locking their sights on Shi Feng.Shi Feng used the Instantaneous Movement Magic Scroll without hesitation. Golden-colored magical seals suddenly wrapped around Shi Feng. The spell on the Magic Scroll had a cast time of three seconds, and it was capable of sending the player to a selected location.This Magic Scroll was extremely precious. Although there were only a few copies of it in the entire God\u2019s Domain, dying in this place was a much greater loss to Shi Feng.Just as Shi Feng was about to be slashed by the golden statues, he vanished from the temple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41 \u2013 Commotion in TownRed Leaf Town, Fountain Plaza.The entire plaza was dyed crimson by the setting sun. There were quite a lot of Lifestyle players[1] setting up food stalls and selling snacks that were unique to God\u2019s Domain.These snacks tasted delicious, and they were much better than the delicacies in real life. Also, their selling price was just 2 or 3 Coppers. It was truly a bargain.Many players would come here to rest and taste the delicacies of God\u2019s Domain after a day\u2019s worth of hard-fought battles. After all, they could only earn tens of Coppers in a single day, and after deducting the expended costs, they would only be left with slightly over ten Coppers. So, giving them a treat should not be a problem.There were quite a few couples sitting on the stone benches, chatting. They ate the food they bought as they enjoyed a lovely time.Suddenly, every player in Red Leaf Town received a System Announcement.System: A player has triggered a special storyline. \u2018Insurrection of the Little Fishmen\u2019 has been activated. An Expedition Quest has been activated in Red Leaf Town. Players can now receive the Expedition Quest from the Adventurer\u2019s Guild. Completing the Expedition Quest will reward players with bountiful rewards and Guild Reputation.All the players were shocked. In Red Leaf Town, a place where Quests were extremely rare, there was actually an Expedition Quest. Moreover, the rewards were great. It was truly unimaginable.\u201cWho was the awesome person that actually triggered a special storyline?\u201dThe player who achieved this feat attracted the attention of every player in Red Leaf Town. Everyone wondered what great rewards this player gained for activating the storyline. After all, activating a storyline was definitely a rare occurrence. So, how could the rewards be few?Quite a lot of players started having their own wicked thoughts. They wanted to kill off the player who activated the storyline Quest. Unfortunately, the System Announcement did not reveal the player\u2019s name.Compared to the average players, the various large Guilds were in a state of turmoil. At this stage of the game, aside from clearing Dungeons, there was not a single Quest that was capable of increasing Guild Reputation.A Guild required Guild Reputation to level up. As long as their Guild could reach Level 2 a step earlier, they would be able to obtain the corresponding Guild benefits, creating a large advantage over the other Guilds.Currently, the other Towns surrounding Scarlet River also received the same System Announcement; it wasn\u2019t just Red Leaf Town. All of the large Guilds began strategizing a plan for their crusade against the Little Fishmen.Meanwhile, Shi Feng, who was the cause of all this commotion, currently sat inside the Auction House.The Auction House was a very convenient place. The items placed on auction by players were not just limited to Red Leaf Town; they could be seen and bought in the hundreds of Towns and small Cities under the influence of White River City. However, the Auction House was very cunning. They charged a 5% handling fee for all items auctioned, so the items there are usually very expensive.However, the Auction House was unquestionably the best place for players to sell certain items anonymously. Also, it had been quite some time since God\u2019s Domain started. The players had already amassed quite an amount of Coins, and the large Guilds should have already piled up a lot of funding. If Shi Feng were to set up a stall in Red Leaf Town, not only would he attract attention, he might also be targeted by people like Flaming Tiger.More importantly, the reason Shi Feng chose the Auction House was that there were too few players in Red Leaf Town who could afford the items he planned to sell. However, it was a different story if there were hundreds of Towns competing for them.Hence, Shi Feng placed a Mysterious-Iron Plate Armor on the Auction House, setting its base price at 25 Silver Coins. Then, he placed five pieces of Bronze Equipment, with the base price of the Plate Armor at 3 Silver Coins, and the others at 2 Silver Coins. As for the Level 10 Fine-Gold Greatsword, the result of placing it on auction would be too terrifying to imagine. This weapon was worth at least 2 Gold Coins, which was the equivalent of 200 Silver Coins. Currently, even 1 Silver Coin was extremely precious; so who would be able to even afford the weapon?Following which, Shi Feng searched his bag via the half-transparent screen. Initially, players were gifted with a bag that had 100 slots. However, it was far from enough for Shi Feng. Every player could equip a maximum of seven bags. So, Shi Feng immediately bought six of the largest bags currently available. Each of the bags had 25 slots, and each sold for 40 Copper Coins. Six bags meant 240 Copper Coins. Such an amount was definitely unaffordable to normal players, but it was just a small sum to Shi Feng.Shi Feng\u2019s storage space increased by a lot after equipping the six bags.Afterward, Shi Feng left the Auction House and set up a stall not far from it. He was not the least bit interested with the Storyline Quest he triggered.He would not fight over the rewards with the others. He already had his fill; so it was only proper for the others to have the leftovers.\u201cBuying Magic Essences and Stones in bulk. A stack[2] of Magic Essences for 6 Coppers; a stack of Stones for 10 Coppers.\u201d Shi Feng loudly shouted.At this stage of the game, Magic Essences were some of the materials needed to practice Enchanting, whereas Stones were one of the building materials Engineers needed. However, many Level 0 to Level 3 monsters would drop these materials when killed, so they were barely worth anything. The materials the many Guilds obtained were also sufficient to supply their own Lifestyle players, so they would never buy any of them. As for normal players, they would only occasionally buy these materials.However, there was still an ocean of players that did not know how to deal with these materials. They would usually sell these materials to NPCs at a low price. A stack of 20 bottles of Magic Essence sold for 5 Coppers, and a stack of 100 Stones sold for 9 Coppers. Shi Feng bought them at a price of 1 Copper Coin higher, so there were quite a lot of players who were willing to sell their materials to him. An extra Copper per stack would still be quite a significant income.Magic Essence was one of the required materials to make the Garrison Armor. Besides that, large amounts of Copper Ore and Bronze Ore were also needed. These ores were scarcely available, and all the large Guilds bought them in bulk. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to get ahold of them.Shi Feng also originally planned to grind for ore. However, now that he had the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, ore was no longer a problem. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone could carry out Elemental Refinement. That meant it could refine Stone. There was a great chance to obtain ore, even rare ore. There was absolutely no need for Shi Feng to personally grind for them; he could just buy them at an extremely low price. Because of this, tens of thousands of players had effectively become Shi Feng\u2019s laborers.Very quickly, a large crowd of players had gathered in front of Shi Feng.\u201cBig Brother, I have 6 stacks of Magic Essence here. Will you take them?\u201d\u201cI have 3 stacks of Stone; do you want them?\u201dMany players started asking Shi Feng, worried that his bag would fill. After all, they just had too many Magic Essences and Stones. There were no players who were willing to buy these materials. However, it was also a shame to just sell them to the NPCs, so the materials just stayed inside their bags.\u201cI\u2019ll take all of them. Just trade them over,\u201d Shi Feng said.Before this, Shi Feng amassed quite a bit of wealth. Including his transaction with Gentle Snow, he was in possession of quite a lot of Coins. Shi Feng could definitely buy large amounts of Magic Essences and Stones.A player was selling three stacks of Magic Essences here\u2026 A player was selling five stacks of Stones there\u2026 Within moments, Shi Feng had acquired 60 stacks of Magic Essences and 85 stacks of Stones. The money that remained in his pockets was less than 10 Coppers now.\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m full,\u201d Shi Feng packed up his stall after explaining.Suddenly, the many remaining players who came to sell off their Magic Essences and Stones had faces filled with disappointment.\u201cBig Brother, will you still buy them in the future?\u201d A player asked.\u201cI will. However, it will still be a period before I do buy them. You all can save them up for now.\u201d Shi Feng resolutely said. The amount of Magic Essences and Stones Shi Feng just purchased was far from enough for him to become an Advanced Forging Apprentice[3].After leaving the business street, Shi Feng arrived at the Forging Association. He paid 5 Coppers to rent a Basic Forging Room for one hour.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euInside the Basic Forging Room, all the equipment needed for forging was provided; players did not need to buy their own equipment. The Intermediate Ranked Forging Room was a lot better; it could increase the success rate of Forging by 3%. However, it costs 1 Silver per hour to use that room. As for Advanced Forging Rooms, those were not available in small Towns. They were only available in Cities. However, their prices were extremely staggering.TL Notes:[1]Lifestyle players: Players who focus on their Auxiliary Jobs i.e. Forgers, Alchemists/Potionmakers etc.[2]a stack: This is a gaming term used to refer to a group of identical items which will take up only one space/slot in the player\u2019s bag. The stack of items has a maximum limit as to the amount of items it can hold within a slot, i.e. a full stack of Magic Essence has 20 bottles of the item. If a player has 21 bottles of Magic Essence, a second stack will be created in the player\u2019s bag.[3]Advanced Forging Apprentice: Forgers can be distinguished into several stages, which are Forging Apprentice -> Forger -> Master Forger -> Grandmaster Forger.

    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42 \u2013 Elemental RefinementForging Association, inside a Forging Room.Shi Feng took out a stack of Stone, placing it on the table.A stack of Stone had a hundred pieces in total. They immediately filled up the round table; some even fell to the ground.\u201cTime to see how good you actually are,\u201d Shi Feng smiled as he retrieved the crimson red Philosopher\u2019s Stone.If the Philosopher\u2019s Stone were seen by someone else, the consequences Shi Feng would face would be immense. Hence, Shi Feng rented a Forging Room. Without his permission, nobody could enter the room.Shi Feng took a piece of Stone from the table and used the Philosopher\u2019s Stone on it.System: Do you wish to use the Philosopher\u2019s Stone for Elemental Refinement?Shi Feng immediately chose \u2018Yes.\u2019 Following which, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone started emitting a faint red glow; a mysterious power flowed into the Stone.Peng!The Stone the size of a fist suddenly turned into yellow sand, scattering to the ground. The result was a failure.However, Shi Feng revealed a calm smile at the result. It did not perturb him in the slightest. Afterward, he picked up another Stone and tried again.Ore was very precious. A normal Copper Ore sold for 2 Coppers; they were only worth 1 Copper Coin if sold to an NPC. A stack of 100 Copper Ore could be sold for 200 Copper Coins to Guilds, and they would still fight over them. Compared to a stack of Stone, which only sold for 10 Copper Coins, Copper Ore was just too expensive.Elemental Refinement extracted the Metal Element out of the Stone. However, some Stones did not possess any Metal Element. So, it was only natural that they turn to sand. Such failures were just too common.Peng\u2026 Peng\u2026 Peng\u2026There was still no ore after ten consecutive tries. Shi Feng started becoming depressed. The success rate was just too low.Shi Feng even started to suspect that these Stones were picked from a desert to result in all the yellow sand.\u201cRelax, relax. There are still many Stones left.\u201d Shi Feng sucked in a deep breath, reassuring himself.He picked up another piece of Stone, trying Elemental Refinement once more.Peng!This time, the Stone still scattered into a pile of sand. However, in the middle of the yellow grains, there was a piece of metal that had a purplish-red luster. It was Copper Ore.With the first piece of Copper Ore in his hands, Shi Feng let out a relaxed breath. His hands started moving at a faster pace.All the Stones above the stone table turned into yellow sand within moments. The stack of Stones had yielded a total of 23 pieces of Copper Ore and 2 pieces of Bronze Ore. Compared to Copper Ore, the price of Bronze Ore was three times that of Copper Ore; they were worth 3 Copper Coins when sold to NPCs. Due to the rarity of Bronze Ore, players would buy them at 7 Copper Coins a piece.Seeing the ores on the table, Shi Feng felt the Philosopher\u2019s Stone was truly a gold mine. Even if the Philosopher\u2019s Stone was currently damaged, it was still out of the ordinary. It was no wonder why many kingdoms were willing to muster up their armies and fight for the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. Having the Philosopher\u2019s Stone in hand was the equivalent of having a wealthy treasury. At that time, a kingdom would find it hard not to become prosperous.Shi Feng kept the ores on the table and brought out another stack of Stones.Stack after stack of Stones disappeared, whereas the amount of yellow sand had piled up into a small hill. Fortunately, the Forging Room could be cleaned of rubbish with just a click of a button. After pushing the Clean button, the small hill of yellow sand vanished from sight.After spending an hour\u2019s time, Shi Feng had refined 40 stacks of Stones. He had obtained a little over 7 stacks of Copper Ore and a little over 1 stack of Bronze Ore. They would be worth over 20 Silver Coins if Shi Feng sold them. Meanwhile, the cost of obtaining these ores were only four Silver Coins. The difference was five-times the price. It was an absolute profit.Most importantly, ores dropped in very small numbers, so it was impossible to buy them in bulk.Shi Feng received a System Notification the moment he had left the Forging Room.System: The Violent Bear Armor you placed at the Auction House has been sold. After deducting the procedural fees, 31 Silvers 53 Coppers have been placed in your bag.System: The Dark Star Boots you placed at the Auction House has been sold. After deducting the procedural fees, 3 Silvers 21 Coppers have been placed in your bag.\u2026\u2026A series of notifications from the Auction House had caused Shi Feng\u2019s lips into a smile.\u201cAs expected, the greater the competition, the higher the price would go\u201d Shi Feng was very satisfied with the amount the items sold for. He never imagined that a Mysterious-Iron Plate Armor for Shield Warriors could actually be sold for over 30 Silver Coins. It seems there were a lot of wealthy people within the area of influence of White River City.After selling the equipment, Shi Feng had suddenly become a wealthy tycoon. With over 50 Silver Coins in his pockets, even his confidence was different now.Currently, players would still be happy over having twenty to thirty Copper Coins on their person. Shi Feng already possessed more than 50 Silver Coins. Including the Silver Coins Gentle Snow owed him, if Shi Feng were to sell off the Copper Ore he had immediately, he would instantly become wealthy with gold.However, he would not sell the ores. These ores were the foundation for Shi Feng to earn big money.Following which, Shi Feng rented the Forging Room for another hour. He turned the remaining Stones into ores. His luck was better this time around. From 45 stacks of Stones, he obtained 10 stacks of Copper Ore and 2 stacks of Bronze Ore.With this, Shi Feng had a total of 17 stacks of Copper Ore and 3 stacks of Bronze Ore. It would be quite some time before Shi Feng could use them all up.With money in hand now, Shi Feng once more arrived at the central area of the Forging Association, at the administration area. Currently, there were quite a few Forger players, that were groomed by Guilds, renting Forging Rooms.\u201cThis is just evil. It actually costs 5 Coppers for an hour. My Guild just gave me 30 Coppers. That\u2019s not enough at all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s considered good already. At least the equipment is all there. Look at the Forging equipment. Even the most common required a few Silvers. An entire set would cost over 30 Silver Coins! It\u2019s just a blatant rip-off!\u201d\u201cYou still haven\u2019t seen the Intermediate Forging Room. It costs one Silver an hour, but the room only increases your success rate by 3%. Even a first-rate Guild would not be able to handle such a price.\u201dA few Forgers continuously complained. They bitterly detested the prices set by the Forging Association. However, there was also a hint of bragging carried in their voices. After all, they had the support of their Guilds, whereas normal players wouldn\u2019t even be able to rent a Forging Room, not to mention increasing their Forging Levels.Shi Feng circled these players, walking towards the manager of the Association, saying, \u201cI want to rent an Intermediate Forging Room.\u201d\u201cMay I know how long you wish to rent it for?\u201d The ashen youth who was the Association\u2019s manager excitedly asked.Currently, a majority of the adventurers were poor blokes. Every one of them only rented the Basic Forging Rooms, and even then, they rented with unwillingness. So, a great change occurred to the manager\u2019s servicing attitude when he was able to see a rich adventurer like Shi Feng.Looking at the time, it was currently morning in the real world. When using the Virtual Gaming Helmet, a person could not stay within God\u2019s Domain for too long.\u201cTwo hours then.\u201d Shi Feng said after some thought.\u201cAlright, here is your key. That will be a total of 2 Silver Coins.\u201d The manager handed the key over to Shi Feng, smiling.Shi Feng took out two shiny Silver Coins, placing them on the table and turning around to leave.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe players who had previously been discussing the deviousness of the Forging Association were all dumbstruck. They even thought they were hallucinating. However, they were indeed Silver Coins on the table, and not the scarlet-yellow Copper Coins.\u201cCrap, a tycoon!\u201d A male Elementalist said in envy.\u201cBrother Tycoon, Little Sister knows how to warm beds.\u201d Another pretty and flirtatious female player winked at Shi Feng, flattering him.\u201cIsn\u2019t it just some dirty money? I will definitely become an Intermediate Forging Apprentice a step ahead of him,\u201d a male Priest said in a sour tone, even though he knew it to be impossible. The facilities of the Intermediate Forging Room were much better than the Basic one. On the surface, the room itself only increased the success rate of forging by 3%. However, including the facilities that came with the room, the success rate was increased by at least 5%.To a Forger, a difference of 5% success rate was like the difference between heaven and earth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43 \u2013 Book Of ForgingShi Feng took the key to the Intermediate Forging Room and went up the second floor, ignoring the flirting young lady.The first floor of the Forging Association only had Basic Forging Rooms, whereas Intermediate Forging Rooms were located on the second floor.When compared to the first floor, there were far fewer people on the second floor. There were only NPCs walking around. Players would not come to this place at all. Also, there were only twenty Intermediate Forging Rooms, unlike the Basic Rooms, which numbered at fifty.Shi Feng entered the Intermediate Forging Room. The room was much larger and refined. The facilities available were also better than the Basic room, especially the Hammer and Flame. These two items were not simple at all.Shi Feng held up the silvery-white hammer that was placed on the iron-woven felt.[Hundred Refinement Hammer] (Bronze-rank)Forging Items: When Forging, the success rate is increased by 3%.Requirements: Strength 4Just this Hundred Refinement Hammer alone was hard to obtain by players. The best hammers NPCs sold were Common Hammers. Those hammers did not increase the success rate of Forging. As for stealing this Hundred Refinement Hammer, it was an impossible task. Items that belonged to the Forging Room could not be taken away by players.The Flame here was extraordinary as well. Instead of the usual scarlet, yellow color, the Flame here burned with a scarlet, green color. It was not a common Flame, but a Mysterious Flame.Shi Feng took a look at its description.Scarlet Devil Flame (Tier 1 Mysterious Flame)Special Item: Possesses extremely high temperatures. Items smelted with the Flame will have higher purity. When refining potions or forging items, there will be a definite increase in success rates.Mysterious Flames were rare and powerful Flames. These Flames had varying strength, and they could be categorized into nine tiers. The first tier was the weakest, whereas the ninth tier was the strongest. However, even a first tier Mysterious Flame was not something that could be easily obtained by players.Due to the Mysterious Flame\u2019s rarity, its price within God\u2019s Domain was extremely high. Including the fact that both Potion-making and Forging required Mysterious Flames, the prices of Mysterious Flames had become even more shocking.There was once a Tier 4 Flame that caused tens of first-rate Guilds to fight over it. After the death of millions of players, the Flame finally ended up in the hands of the World Dominators. Not long after, a Master Potionmaker in World Dominators rose to become a Grandmaster Potionmaker, increasing the influence of the World Dominators by a large leap.Shi Feng had a great yearning within him when he looked at the burning Mysterious Flame. It was the thirst of a Forger.Just when Shi Feng was in deep thought, he suddenly recalled a matter.On the second month of God\u2019s Domain\u2019s operation, the third-rate Guild, Glorious Light, had discovered a Tier 2 Mysterious Flame, Ice-Blue Devil Flame. The Flame was found in the Hundred Ghosts Forest, and its discovery induced great envy into the other Guilds. At that time, there were a lot of Lifestyle players who had applied to join Glorious Light, allowing the Guild\u2019s power to abruptly increase and becoming the tyrant of a small City. However, there were also many Guilds who gathered information in secret, wanting to obtain a Mysterious Flame for themselves. Naturally, Shadow was no exception to this.Shadow had discovered the location and method of obtainment of the Mysterious Flame from Glorious Light\u2019s inner circle. Unfortunately, such Mysterious Flames only appeared once, never appearing again after they were gone. This discovery caused many Guilds to waste their efforts.As he was thinking about the Ice-Blue Devil Flame, Shi Feng suddenly started having intentions towards this Mysterious Flame. If he could make it his own, it would definitely be of great help to him in the future when he started his own Guild. Moreover, the Flame would be of great help in pushing Shi Feng to become a true Forger[1].However, Shi Feng still needed to hash out a proper plan to obtain the Ice-Blue Devil Flame. He needed to prepare many things before he could obtain the Flame.Following which, Shi Feng took out the Garrison Armor\u2019s Forging Design. Without wasting time, he immediately chose to learn it.System: You have learned how to forge the Garrison Armor.Afterward, Shi Feng placed all the needed materials onto the stone table. Then, he took out the immensely precious Book Of Forging and started to forge.Shi Feng was a Basic Forging Apprentice. His success rate for forging a Level 0 Common Equipment did not exceed 20%, and after a successful forging, there was a 40% chance for him to obtain 1 Proficiency Point. If Shi Feng were to forge the Garrison Armor, a Level 3 Bronze Equipment, his chance of success would not exceed 5%. Successfully forging a piece of Bronze Equipment would bring an additional bonus, which was a 100% chance to obtain 2 Proficiency Points.However, 1000 Proficiency Points were needed to become an Intermediate Forging Apprentice. Obtaining such a large amount of points required equally large funding to support it. There was no way for a Lifestyle player to support such a large sum of money by themselves.The Forgers in Guilds all started out by forging Common Equipment. There was not a single Guild who would allow these Lifestyle players to forge Bronze Equipment right off the bat. To begin with, they didn\u2019t even possess a Forging Design for Bronze Equipment, and even if they did, they wouldn\u2019t carry out such an action. The success rate of a Basic Forging Apprentice was just too low, and the materials needed were just too expensive. A single failure would cost 1 Silver Coin or more. It was a loss that not even Guilds could handle. Moreover, they couldn\u2019t even collect that many materials to make the equipment.However, Shi Feng did not have such worries. He had the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, so he did not lack in resources. Furthermore, the materials needed to make the Garrison Armor were cheaply-priced. It only required 5 bottles of Magic Essences, 5 pieces of Bronze Ore, and 20 pieces of Copper Ore. The cost of making the Garrison Armor was only 80 Copper Coins. When compared to the cost of making other Bronze Equipment, it was at least 20 Coppers cheaper. The Garrison Armor also had very good Attributes, so it was extremely welcomed. Shi Feng wouldn\u2019t have to be troubled over figuring out how to sell it.The most important thing was the Book Of Forging.The Book Of Forging could increase the success rate of forging Common Equipment by 70%, Bronze Equipment by 50%, Mysterious-Iron Equipment by 30%, Secret-Silver Equipment by 20%, Fine-Gold Equipment by 10%, Dark-Gold Equipment by 5%, and Epic Equipment by 1%.With such Attributes, the Book Of Forging could allow a player to become a Master Forger easily and unimpeded.Basic Forging Apprentices originally had a 20% success rate at forging Common Equipment. Including the 70% from the book, the success rate would become 90%. Further including the facilities of the Intermediate Forging Room and removing the possibilities of mistakes, the success rate of making Common Equipment was 99% or higher. Unless the player was a pig[2], failure was impossible.The Book Of Forging\u2019s frightening abilities could clearly be seen from this.As for the Garrison Armor, Shi Feng had a 5% success rate for making it. Including the 50% from the book, the 3% from the room\u2019s facilities, and also the effects of the Mysterious Flame, Shi Feng now had a 60% success rate for making the Garrison Armor. Not to mention Bronze Equipment, even if Common Equipment had a 60% success rate, it would still drive Forger players mad. Such a high percentage for success was something unimaginable to Forgers.Following which, Shi Feng started slowly making the Garrison Armor according to the Forging Design\u2019s requirements. He first smelted the Copper and Bronze Ore in the fire. After being in the fire for five minutes, the ores started to melt and form a lump. Afterward, Shi Feng added in the Magic Essence, letting it burn for another minute before removing the red-hot ore and placing it onto the metal felt. The ore\u2019s scorching hot temperature caused Shi Feng to sweat. However, Shi Feng did not dare be careless, as the following process was the most important part.After finishing the preparations, Shi Feng held the Hundred Refinement Hammer and readied it to hammer the fiery ore.Dang\u2026 Dang\u2026 Dang\u2026Sparks flew in all directions. The hammering sounds echoed throughout the wide Forging Room.Shi Feng struck every hit with careful precision.In his previous life, Shi Feng did not learn Forging. He only learned the Gathering skill. However, he still knew quite a lot about Forging. After all, he had conversed with a Master Forger quite often, so he was knowledgeable to the degree of not making certain low-leveled mistakes.After hammering the ore over a hundred times, Shi Feng felt that it was perfect. Shi Feng wiped away the sweat on his forehead, carefully selecting the crimson ore\u2019s interface and clicking the Complete button.Following which, the red-hot ore started transforming. Within five seconds, it had transformed into a silvery-gray colored armor. On the surface, there seemed to be nothing wrong with it. However, equipment\u2019s successful forging did not just depend on its appearances; there was also its quality. Quality included the equipment\u2019s Attributes and rank.Bronze Equipment that was badly forged would have their ranks decreased to Common, or their base Attributes would not be up to standards.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHence, Shi Feng selected the information of the armor, checking whether it was a success or a failure.TL Notes:[1]a true Forger => this part is referring to the ranks for a Forger i.e. Forging Apprentice -> Forger -> Master Forger -> Grandmaster Forger[2]Unless the player was a pig => An idiotChanged Ice-Fire Devil Flame to Ice-Blue Devil Flame as of 07/12/2017Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So, Shi Feng was, more or less, slightly nervous.After Shi Feng selected the option to check the armor\u2019s information, three words appeared on the panel: Identification in progress.The red loading bar slowly increased. The System was currently determining the statistics of the equipment.After three seconds had passed, the System finished identifying the armor and revealed the armor\u2019s information.[Garrison Armor] (Bronze-rank Plate Armor)Level 3Equipment Requirement: Strength 10Defense +22Strength +2, Endurance +2HP +150Durability 35/35Additional Ability-Defensive Power: reduces damage taken by 3%.Restricted to Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights.System: Garrison Armor has been successfully forged. Forging Proficiency increased by 2 points. Obtained 800 EXP.\u201cGreat! It even has an Additional Ability, Defensive Power.\u201d Shi Feng was extremely happy when he saw the Additional Ability on the Garrison Armor.He never imagined his first try at forging a piece of Bronze Equipment would be a success. He even obtained so much EXP. It was no wonder why the Master Forgers in his previous life never went out to grind, but their levels were not a bit low. Not only had the Garrison Armor forged met the standard Attribute values, but it also possessed an Additional Ability.Originally, the Garrison Armor did not possess Defensive Power. However, when the Forger exhibited extraordinary skill, coupled with the presence of the Mysterious Flame, there was a chance for an Additional Ability to appear on the equipment. In such occurrences, the price of the equipment would be increased to another level.Shi Feng took his time sizing up the Garrison Armor, feeling the texture of the silvery-gray metal and admiring its eye-catching design. The average piece of Bronze Equipment was absolutely no match for it. Shi Feng was very satisfied with his creation.Currently, Common Equipment was still the mainstream equipment for players. Even if players were to reach Level 6 in the future, it would not be a surprise to find them wearing only Common Equipment. After all, it was too hard to obtain Bronze Equipment. As for the Elite parties, just having one to two pieces of Bronze Equipment was considered being blessed.The Garrison Armor could be used by both Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights. If Shi Feng were to sell the armor, the Elite parties would definitely welcome it. After all, the quality of an MT\u2019s equipment could ease the difficulty of conquering a Dungeon a lot. Even if Shi Feng were to set the price at 4 Silver Coins, these parties would still buy the armor, regardless the cost.As for the Defensive Power of the Garrison Armor, its benefits towards a party\u2019s MT went without saying. Shi Feng would not accept anything lower than 5 Silver Coins for this armor.With his first experience at successful forging, Shi Feng continued forging Garrison Armors.However, Shi Feng took out the Hundred Refinement Steel this time. He wanted to know what effects the steel would have when it was used to forge equipment.Within ten minutes, the second Garrison Armor took form.However, the color on this Garrison Armor was different than the previous one. Instead of having a silvery-gray color, it was pitch-black now.After going through three seconds of identification, the System displayed the statistics to Shi Feng.[Garrison Heavy Armor] (Bronze-rank Plate Armor)Level 3Equipment Requirement: Strength 14Defense +25Strength +2, Endurance +4HP +150Durability 40/40Additional Ability-Defensive Power: reduces damage taken by 5%.Restricted to Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights.System: Garrison Heavy Armor has been successfully forged. Forging Proficiency increased by 2 points. Obtained 1,000 EXP.System: Due to your Forging Genius, Forging Proficiency has been increased by an additional 2 points.Currently, Shi Feng had completely forgotten about the additional Proficiency Points that his Forging Talent gave him. Instead, his eyes were fixated on the Garrison Heavy Armor. The Attributes on the armor were already comparable to a piece of Level 3 Mysterious-Iron Equipment. The price-tag on it was at least 10 Silver Coins.Shi Feng never imagined that the Hundred Refinement Steel would create such large changes. Shi Feng had no choice but to admit that the item given by a Master Forger was not ordinary. Unfortunately, Shi Feng only had nine pieces of Hundred Refinement Steel remaining.Naturally, now that Shi Feng knew the effects of the Hundred Refinement Steel, he would not simply squander them away. He would set them aside and use them when he had good equipment to forge.Two hours quickly passed by. Shi Feng forged Garrison Armors without stopping during this time. He had obtained a total of 23 pieces of Garrison Armor, but he also failed to forge four pieces.Shi Feng was very satisfied with the result. A single, successfully forged Garrison Armor could easily remedy the loss of the four failures.At the same time, Shi Feng himself had also risen to Level 3. His current level was not that far from the expert players. Moreover, his Forging Proficiency had increased to 44 points. Such an increase was at least four to five times faster than those Forgers that belonged to Guilds.Following which, Shi Feng left the Intermediate Forging Room and arrived in front of the Auction House.He immediately auctioned off the 11 pieces of Garrison Armor that did not possess Defensive Power, their base prices set at 4 Silver Coins. As for the Garrison Armors and Garrison Heavy Armor that possessed Defensive Power, Shi Feng placed them aside for now. He wanted to let these Guilds and Elite parties have a taste of the armor first. That way, the remaining Garrison Armors could be sold at an even better price.Afterward, Shi Feng set up a stall in the Trade Area, casually yelling out. Following which, many players ran over to Shi Feng, selling their Stones and Magic Essences to him. After purchasing the materials for half an hour, Shi Feng took a look at the time. It was near nightfall in God\u2019s Domain. The monsters at night became much more powerful and killing them became much more difficult. This period was not suited for leveling, and Shi Feng should rest as well.Currently, he was still using the Virtual Gaming Helmet, not the Virtual Gaming Pod, to play God\u2019s Domain. The Virtual Gaming Pod could provide the energy and nutrients required by the player\u2019s body at any time. It could also stimulate the body\u2019s muscles, preventing the body from weakening due to playing God\u2019s Domain for long periods.Shi Feng\u2019s finger tapped and clicked, calling out the System Interface and choosing to log off.Currently, within the cramped rented apartment, the sunlight had long since seeped through the windows and scattered throughout the room. The temperature within the room was also starting to rise.Shi Feng took off the gaming helmet. He lifted up his body and stretched.After more than ten hours of inactivity and lying on the bed, Shi Feng\u2019s body was numbed throughout. He needed to move around before he could return to normal.Shi Feng started doing push-ups, sit-ups, and other forms of basic training.In this extremely materialistic age, body training had already become indispensable in one\u2019s life.After tens of years of constant research, scientists have managed to obtain a huge breakthrough in strengthening the human body and prolonging its lifespan. Mankind could now retain their youth for a longer period. The breakthrough also increased the average lifespan of a person to one hundred years old. At the same time, scientists had pointed out the necessity of working out the body.Henceforth, the age of exercise had arrived.In current times, sports tournaments and fighting competitions were the attention of the public eye.Just in the university alone, there were already plenty of sports societies and martial arts societies, and they were very welcomed by the students.In the current society, those who did not possess a trick up their sleeves would be looked down upon. On the other hand, those celebrity athletes and martial arts experts were absolutely revered. In the university, there was never a lack of beautiful women surrounding the distinguished athletes and students who often participated in mixed martial arts competitions. As for pretty boys, their time has long since faded from popularity.In his previous life, Shi Feng did not pay much attention to his body. As a result, he nearly caused its destruction. By the time he wanted to train his body, he was no longer young. Even if he had trained with all his might, the effects would not be great.In this life, Shi Feng would not be the same as before, naturally. He would not solely pay attention to God\u2019s Domain, ignoring his body\u2019s training.After training for half an hour, Shi Feng\u2019s entire body was covered with sweat. It looked as if he had just taken a shower. Just when he was about to dine on his cooked instant noodles, his phone started ringing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Feng looked at the contacting person. Unexpectedly, it was the usually silent female class monitor, Zhao Ruoxi.\u201cClass Monitor, what\u2019s up?\u201d Shi Feng asked after answering the call.According to Shi Feng memories, aside from attending classes, Shi Feng never had any contact with the female class monitor. Within the four years, Shi Feng had spent in the university, he had not spoken over a hundred sentences with Zhao Ruoxi.\u201cShi Feng, hurry over to school. I failed to notify you of this because you do not live in the male dormitories, but now I\u2019m telling you. At 11 o\u2019clock, there will be an important matter being announced at Teaching Block 3, Classroom 401.\u201dShi Feng looked towards the electronic clock on his table. It was already half past ten right now. He answered, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go there immediately.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was one of the reasons that caused his parents to fall gravely ill.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, he and Blackie joined Shadow Workshop. When Zhao Ruoxi called him to go to the school, he chose to continue playing God\u2019s Domain instead of going. He joined Shadow Workshop after much trouble. If he wanted to rise in position within Shadow, he needed to have a good performance. How could he have the time to care about small matters that happened in the classroom?As a result, his university recommendation became nonexistent. Although it was just a recommendation, it could allow students to find better jobs. The stress levels of the current society were extremely powerful, and jobs were not easy to find. Such a recommendation would be a stepping stone towards the higher levels of a company.Shi Feng\u2019s parents were deeply worried after they found out about this incident.It was also because of such worries that caused the mental stress on his parents to increase substantially. Only, Shi Feng\u2019s parents never revealed it to him. Instead, they encouraged him. They didn\u2019t want him to worry about their household debts. As a result, they became both physically and mentally exhausted, falling gravely ill a year later.In this life, Shi Feng did not wish to repeat such a disaster, even if the recommendation was absolutely useless to him. However, he also wished to know the reason that caused him to lose the recommendation.Shi Feng was considered average regarding results amongst his class. There were absolutely no problems with him obtaining the recommendation. He did not have a share in it. The only reason he could think of, for such a situation, was the incident that would happen today.After walking into the university, Shi Feng discovered a very interesting situation.The school was crowded; there was an abnormal number of students in the university today. Usually, there would not be that many people within the university grounds. The students would usually study in the library or gather outside to have some fun. Worst case scenario, they would just stay in their dormitories and play games. Unlike the current situation, they wouldn\u2019t normally come out for a stroll.When Shi Feng walked towards Teaching Block 3, he discovered that the normally empty classrooms were packed with people. All of them were fully occupied.\u201cWhat is happening today?\u201d Shi Feng was puzzled.The moment Shi Feng entered Classroom 401, he could feel the air in the room was slightly odd. His classmates all shifted their gaze towards him, their expressions filled with astonishment. Shi Feng was like something that should not be there, yet had actually appeared.The male students only glanced at Shi Feng. They did not pay him any attention as they continued with their conversations.Meanwhile, some of the gorgeously dressed females in the class sent Shi Feng expressions of disgust. However, Shi Feng had long since gotten used to such reactions. When he was about to turn around and look at them, the females immediately turned their heads away.\u201cFellow student Shi Feng, you\u2019re here. Find a place to sit. When fellow student Ling Feilong arrives, everyone in the class will be present.\u201d The female monitor, Zhao Ruoxi, had a calm expression on her face when she spoke to Shi Feng as if it was all just for formality\u2019s sake.However, Shi Feng could faintly feel a hint of expectation in Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s eyes when she turned around to look at him. However, that expectation was not targeted towards him, but most probably towards the Ling Feilong she spoke of.\u201cAlright.\u201d Shi Feng nodded his head, simply choosing a corner to sit down in. As for sitting and starting a conversation with the other male classmates, Shi Feng could tell it would be impossible just by looking at their expressions.In regards to such a situation, Shi Feng could only let loose a bitter smile. In his previous life, he truly has failed at being a functioning human being\u2026However, there was nothing he could do. To save money, he never participated in any of the student gatherings or class events. He had long since become an invisible existence within the class. In the eyes of his classmates, Shi Feng might be a very reclusive person.\u201cWhy is this person here?\u201d\u201cThe class monitor should be the one who notified him. I never thought he would actually show up.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just an inferior student in the class. Just looking at him makes me mad. Look at how cunning his eyes are. Don\u2019t tell me he took a fancy to this young lady? Disgusting.\u201dThe students in the class started a quiet discussion about Shi Feng. They were very shocked at Shi Feng\u2019s arrival. Usually, Shi Feng would never participate in any events, but now, this person, himself, actually showed up. Their disgust towards Shi Feng was clear in their speech. Their tones when speaking also showed how much they looked down on him. The reason for such treatment was because Shi Feng was weak. He was also often bullied by students from other classes. Moreover, he was the inferior student who was always too poor to join the class outings. It was just an embarrassment to be in the same class as him.Although their voices were soft, Shi Feng could still hear them clearly. It was better to say they let Shi Feng hear their conversation.Learning was only secondary in everyone\u2019s eyes. The truly important thing to have was a strong body. After all, the current age was one where body training was strongly emphasized upon. However, Shi Feng\u2019s weak body clearly did not fit the current age. So, naturally, he had become an outcast within the class.However, Shi Feng simply laughed away at his situation. He was no longer a child, so why would he be angry over the actions of these children? Currently, his heart was only concerned about the matters regarding the recommendation.Not long after, a robust youth entered the classroom. The youth\u2019s height was an entire 1.9 meters.This person was Ling Feilong.According to Shi Feng\u2019s memories, Ling Feilong was a person with many tricks up his sleeve. After he graduated from university, he managed to woo the princess of a large corporation. Three years later, he became the corporation\u2019s CEO. However, due to the virtual world\u2019s influence towards the real world growing ever larger, Ling Feilong invested in God\u2019s Domain as well. At that time, he looked for Shi Feng, his classmate, wanting to collaborate in God\u2019s Domain.At that time, Shi Feng was the Captain of Shadow Workshop. He was also the Guild Leader of the Guild, Shadow. Shadow was barely considered a second-rate Guild during those times. However, it still had control over a large city with a population of five hundred thousand people.Considering they were once classmates, Shi Feng agreed to Ling Feilong\u2019s proposal. Afterward, although Shadow earned quite a lot of money from the collaboration, Ling Feilong earned even more. At the same time, Ling Feilong groomed several powerful subordinates. Then, he somehow managed to gain the favor of a first-rate Guild, abandoning Shadow.Everyone watched as Ling Feilong entered the classroom. The male students all stood up, displaying their respect towards him. On the other hand, the gorgeous female students from before sent meaningful gazes towards Ling Feilong. Even Zhao Ruoxi had some changes to her calm expression. Shi Feng had plenty of experience with women in his previous life, so he could tell Zhao Ruoxi was somewhat interested in Ling Feilong.\u201cWhat kind of situation was this?\u201d Shi Feng could not make heads of the current situation. It would be fine if it were just the other students, but Zhao Ruoxi was the class flower. She had a calm personality, an oval face, a graceful body, and even her family background were good. Normally, male students from other classes could be seen chasing after her. However, none of them ever entered her eyes. So, why did she take a fancy upon Ling Feilong?Was Ling Feilong fated to become a protagonist in life, a person who was loved and welcomed by all?\u201cEveryone, sit down.\u201d Like a leader, Ling Feilong naturally walked up to the lectern. He gratefully said, \u201cThank you for coming to congratulate me. I would not be here today were it not for all of your support.\u201d\u201cBrother Feilong, you are too humble. More than five thousand people entered the school\u2019s fighting competition, yet you\u2019ve managed to enter the top ten. You are the pride of our class. You now have the rights to enter Jin Hai City\u2019s fighting competition without going through the preselections. This feat is not achievable by the average person. You mustn\u2019t forget about us once you\u2019ve become a martial arts master in the future.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Brother Feilong. We\u2019re looking forward to you becoming the champion.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe students in the class gave their congratulations one after the other. Some of the female students even thought of throwing themselves at Ling Feilong.However, Shi Feng was an exception.He was truly dumbfounded. Originally, he thought a huge incident occurred, but it was just the school\u2019s fighting competition having just ended. They were only here to congratulate Ling Feilong for being able to enter the city\u2019s fighting competition.If it was before, Shi Feng might have envied Ling Feilong. After all, there were just too many people who liked fighting competitions. Those who were able to participate in the city\u2019s fighting competition were much more appreciated than some big celebrity. This was due to the difficulty of entering the fighting competition. There was a strict selection system, and it was considered good to have three to four people selected out of ten thousand. If these selected participants performed well, they might even get a contract to become the spokesperson for a large enterprise. With all the celebrity advertisements that would be offered, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to amass wealth. Their futures would have boundless prospects.However, along with the rise in popularity of God\u2019s Domain, people became even more addicted to fighting battles and wars in the game. After all, being able to personally experience the fight was still the best experience. The lack of danger of fighting in the game only made it even more exciting. As a result, many experts became idols of the players in God\u2019s Domain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His eyes held a hint of dissatisfaction when he looked at Shi Feng.He was the pride of the class and, even more so, a future celebrity. Yet, an inferior student like Shi Feng actually did not intend to flatter him?After a round of flattery, Ling Feilong allowed the students to return to their seats.\u201cI thank everyone for your support. Please quiet down for a moment. I am here today because I have a matter that I wish to discuss,\u201d Ling Feilong said.Hearing Ling Feilong\u2019s announcement, everyone listened attentively. Only Shi Feng remained uninterested towards Ling Feilong\u2019s matter.However, Shi Feng could not help but pay attention after hearing Ling Feilong speak.\u201cIt\u2019s something related to the school\u2019s recommendation.\u201d Ling Feilong calmly said, \u201cEveryone knows how I am obsessed with fighting. However, my grades at school aren\u2019t that good, so it has caused some problems with my recommendation. So, I wish for someone here to give up a spot. The school has already agreed to this; so I am here to discuss this matter with everyone else.\u201d\u201cBrother Long, this is only a trivial matter. It is only a recommendation. As the pride of the class, as long as Brother Long requests it, there will definitely be someone in the class willing to give up their spot,\u201d a bootlicking male student said.Although everyone in the class agreed to this person\u2019s words, there was nobody who willingly stood up to give away their recommendation.In the end, finding a job was just too hard. The recommendation was much more valued than a person\u2019s educational background when working inside a big company. If they were to give up their recommendation, what would they do in the future?As for the ones who had no rights to the recommendation, to begin with, naturally, it was easier to be brave standing from a safe distance. They continuously incited the others like hot-blooded mad-men.Ling Feilong\u2019s expression slightly darkened when he saw nobody taking initiative.\u201cSince everyone is reacting so proactively, it won\u2019t be good if I\u2019m the one who does the choosing. How about this, let\u2019s raise our hands and vote,\u201d Ling Feilong suggested with a smile.\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea! Brother Feilong is the smartest!\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s start voting!\u201dThe hot-blooded mad-men all stood up one after another, their faces holding expressions of delight, delight at the misfortune of others.Shi Feng, who sat by the wall, was suddenly enlightened after looking at this scene.Crap! So it was these bastards who stole my recommendation!A wrathful flame ignited within Shi Feng\u2019s heart. He was truly a fool in his previous life for actually working with Ling Feilong. Not in this life, however. If Ling Feilong wished to cause trouble for him in this life, he couldn\u2019t be blamed for reacting in kind.Maybe it was a continuation of his previous life, but the voting results did not change in the slightest. The students immediately sat Shi Feng on the \u2018throne.\u2019\u201cFellow student Shi Feng, you are really lucky! I\u2019m slightly envious of you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll get to have Brother Long cover for you from now on; you should be grateful to us.\u201dEveryone in the class started congratulating Shi Feng as if Shi Feng had just won a five million Credit lottery.\u201cFellow student, Shi Feng, thank you, truly. After school is over today, I invite you to come with me for a drink at the Maple Leaf Bar,\u201d Ling Feilong smiled a hypocritical smile. He did not place Shi Feng within his sights at all. There was not a hint of gratitude in his tone, only disdain. Following which, he turned to look at the other students, saying, \u201cOf course, everyone else is also invited. Let us enjoy ourselves today.\u201d\u201cHold on a moment,\u201d Shi Feng suddenly said.Suddenly, everyone in the class turned their sights towards Shi Feng. If Shi Feng did not actively speak up, they might have long since forgotten about his existence.\u201cMay I know if fellow student Shi Feng has something he wishes to say?\u201d Ling Feilong looked towards Shi Feng, asking with a smile.\u201cI will not agree with this;, so why are you getting all joyous all on your own?\u201d Shi Feng shot a glance at Ling Feilong, saying, \u201cIf any of you wish to give him your recommendation, then just give it to him. In any case, I won\u2019t be letting go of my recommendation. If there are no other matters, I\u2019ll be leaving.\u201dSuddenly, the entire classroom became dead silent. Nobody could imagine that Shi Feng, a person constantly bullied by students of other classes, actually rebelled against Ling Feilong. His current display was very abnormal. Was Shi Feng not afraid of being taken out by Ling Feilong?Ling Feilong, as well, was shocked, not because of Shi Feng\u2019s actions, however, but at Shi Feng\u2019s foolishness.Did he actually think he could protect his recommendation just because he had refused to hand it over?This was a result voted by the entire class. It would be meaningless, even if Shi Feng refused. When the time came, the university would still give him the recommendation. Even though the result was unchangeable, Shi Feng still foolishly chose to stand against him.Should Shi Feng be called foolish? Or did he have a few screws loose?Just when Ling Feilong wanted to take action, an impatient voice sounded from outside the door.\u201cLittle Long, are you still not done? Brother Zhang doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201dA tall blond youth came in through the door. Following behind him was an alluring girl dressed in sexy and revealing clothing. The two together caused the male students to look on in envy.Shi Feng shot a glance over, discovering that it was actually an \u2018acquaintance.\u2019The tall and blond youth was coincidentally Flaming Tiger. His real name was Zhou Yuhu, and he was a fourth-year university student, similar to Shi Feng. This person had great talent, and he managed to obtain a good result of third place in the university\u2019s fighting tournament this time around. Meanwhile, the enchanting female by Zhou Yuhu\u2019s side was also an acquaintance of Shi Feng\u2019s. Her name was Qin Shuyu, and she was Shi Feng\u2019s classmate during high school; she was also the flower of the class at the time.Shi Feng was truly blind during those times. Young and dumb, he was actually enchanted by Qin Shuyu, even to the point of confessing his love to her. Naturally, the result was rejection. After entering university, Qin Shuyu had become Zhou Yuhu\u2019s girlfriend. Qin Shuyu even mentioned to Zhou Yuhu the matter of Shi Feng\u2019s confession. As a result, Shi Feng was often \u2018taken care of\u2019 by students from other classes. After Shi Feng joined Shadow, he was often sent to carry out senseless tasks, stunting his growth in God\u2019s Domain.\u201cBrother Hu, why have you come here? I\u2019ll immediately go after I\u2019m done settling my business here.\u201d When Ling Feilong saw the person who had arrived, he respectfully went up to welcome him with a smiling face.\u201cHow much longer do you need? I don\u2019t have that much time to waste\u201d Zhou Yuhu wrinkled his brows, impatiently saying. He was parted from his duties as Team Leader today all because of that Ye Feng character, and he had only recently risen to Level 2. Afterward, he was even given a scolding by Brother Zhang. These occurrences caused him to become greatly irritated deep within his heart.\u201cTwo to three minutes should be enough.\u201d Ling Feilong replied. He felt teaching Shi Feng the ways to be a proper person should not be a big problem.\u201cGood, then hurry up,\u201d Zhou Yuhu demanded.Currently, Qin Shuyu\u2019s eyes unintentionally landed on Shi Feng; her expression was suddenly turning sour. She had no good impressions of Shi Feng. He had neither money nor power. There was not the slightest feeling of safety or strength coming from him. When compared with Zhou Yuhu, the difference between the two was hundreds and thousands of miles apart. Shi Feng even confessed to her without knowing his own worth. It was just an insult to her person, and as a result, she was often made fun of by the other girls.Seeing the disgust on Qin Shuyu\u2019s face, Zhou Yuhu hooked up her chin with his robust hand, teasingly saying, \u201cBaby, I\u2019ll take care of him for you immediately, lest he shows up in front of you again.\u201dQin Shuyu faintly smiled as she nodded, not having any intention of stopping Zhou Yuhu.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHey brat, come over here,\u201d Zhou Yuhu pointed his finger at Shi Feng, loudly roaring.Everyone was shocked at seeing Zhou Yuhu\u2019s imposing manner. Who was Zhou Yuhu? He was ranked third in the school\u2019s fighting tournament. He was much more powerful when compared to the ninth-ranked Ling Feilong. A single hit from him was enough to send a person to the hospital for half a month.Ling Feilong naturally understood what was happening before him; Zhou Yuhu was irritated by Shi Feng and wished to take care of him. Originally, he too wanted to teach Shi Feng a lesson and let the entire class know of his prowess. If he were to take care of Shi Feng right now, not only would he be helping himself, but he would also be able to sell a favor to Zhou Yuhu; he would be killing two birds with one stone. Hence, Ling Feilong stepped forward and volunteered, \u201cBrother Hu, no need for you to personally take action. Originally, I already wanted to teach this kid a lesson. Give me thirty seconds.\u201d\u201cLittle Long, so the matter you had to deal with before was this.\u201d Zhou Yuhu looked towards Shi Feng in disdain. He licked his lips, saying with a cold smile, \u201cBetter to let me. I also wish to loosen my bones a little.\u201dSaying this, Zhou Yuhu walked towards Shi Feng with a cold smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 47 \u2013 I Think Highly of YouZhou Yuhu walked towards Shi Feng in an imposing manner. He wanted to personally teach Shi Feng a good, hard lesson this time.On previous occasions, he always sent others to handle it for him. However, Shi Feng still did not learn to be good. Today, he wanted Shi Feng to imprint this lesson onto his bones.The people present could all see the conclusion that was coming for Shi Feng.In a society where the entire population underwent body training, fights between students were all too common. Even minor injuries were very common. As long as it didn\u2019t go overboard, it would not cause an incident.However, looking at Zhou Yuhu\u2019s current attitude, Shi Feng would be staying in the hospital for at least a month. At that time, Shi Feng would be wearing a cast while receiving his graduation certificate on the stage.\u201cHold it, Zhou Yuhu. This is our class. On what basis does an outsider like you have to come and bully someone from our class?\u201d Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s delicate body suddenly blocked Shi Feng. She was not the slightest bit threatened by Zhou Yuhu\u2019s imposing aura as she berated him.Zhou Ruoxi\u2019s actions unquestionably left everyone else in shock. They never imagined that the normally gentle and graceful Zhao Ruoxi would stand up for an inferior student. She was even challenging Zhou Yuhu. She had such a strong heart to be so brave.\u201cRuoxi, don\u2019t stir up trouble. Brother Hu only wishes to give Shi Feng some pointers. This should be Shi Feng\u2019s good fortune. Shi Feng is always being bullied by others, but with Brother Hu\u2019s pointers, he might have some growth and learn to be a proper person,\u201d Ling Feilong explained with a smile. Due to Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s above average appearance and attractive curves, he long since treated her as his personal property. Never would he have imagined that she would stand up for Shi Feng. Suddenly, the rage towards Shi Feng burned even greater in his heart.However, it would not be good for him to reveal that rage, so he simply tugged at Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s delicate hand. He wanted to pull her away, stopping her from being a hindrance.\u201cFellow student Ling Feilong, as the pride of the class, are you just going to watch as one of our classmates being bullied?\u201d Zhao Ruoxi shook off Ling Feilong\u2019s hand, looking at him and asking angrily. She originally thought Ling Feilong was in possession of a good personality. He also performed exceptionally in the fighting competition. So, she thought he was a good prospect. However, she didn\u2019t think that he was just a hypocrite.\u201cRuoxi, how could you say such a thing about me? You are misunderstanding. It isn\u2019t my fault that Shi Feng does not know how to be a proper person. Now that Brother Hu is going to teach him how to become one, it would be beneficial to him in the future,\u201d Ling Feilong said with a righteous expression as if everything occurring was for Shi Feng\u2019s own good.\u201cYou!\u201d Zhao Ruoxi was greatly angered by Ling Feilong. She promptly turned towards Shi Feng, saying, \u201cHurry up and leave. I\u2019ll hold him off.\u201d\u201cThis little girl is interesting and very sexy. I like it.\u201d Zhou Yuhu\u2019s eyes started sizing up Zhao Ruoxi, liking very much what he saw. His lips could not help but curl up into an evil grin as his hand stretched to caress Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s delicate face. He was no longer paying any attention to Shi Feng.However, before his salty pig-hand could touch Zhao Ruoxi, it was slapped away by another.\u201cZhou Yuhu, since you wish to trade notes with me, I can agree. However, just trading notes would not have much meaning to it. How about we spice it up a little,\u201d Shi Feng proposed with a calm smile. He took a step forwards, tugging on Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s jade-like arm and pulling her to a side.Zhao Ruoxi did not react to Shi Feng\u2019s actions at all. Until she was dragged behind him, she only then began to look at Shi Feng\u2019s average stature in stunning shock.When did Shi Feng become so manly?However, she also felt Shi Feng was very foolish. How could he trade pointers with Zhou Yuhu? Now, Zhou Yuhu would have an excuse to teach Shi Feng a lesson.Zhou Yuhu rubbed the reddened back of his hand, enraged. He glared at Shi Feng, suddenly discovering Shi Feng\u2019s current appearance was very calm and stable. It was as if Zhou Yuhu was looking at an entirely different person. Before, Shi Feng would easily be incited and get into fights with others. Now, however, not only was he not aroused, but he was also smiling happily.Was his brain damaged?Ling Feilong was deeply enraged when he saw Shi Feng\u2019s stretched arm actually touching Zhao Ruoxi. He could not help but wish he could take action immediately. However, he still held it in. He was prepared to put Shi Feng in his place in the future.\u201cKid, you actually dare to challenge me. Truly interesting. Then I\u2019ll wager 1000 Credits. If you win, the 1000 Credits will be yours to keep. If you lose, then kneel and apologize to me, and also, compensate me with 1000 Credits. How about it? Do you dare to agree?\u201d Zhou Yuhu furiously smiled. He never thought Shi Feng\u2019s brain was truly damaged, daring to even provoke him.\u201cSuch a petty wager. Aren\u2019t you embarrassed from saying it out loud?\u201d Shi Feng shook his head and snorted in disdain.\u201cYour guts sure have grown after not meeting for a few days. Say it then, what kind of wager do you want?\u201d Zhou Yuhu was angered into a laugh. He knew Shi Feng was poor, and he could not even afford the 1000 Credits. Now though, he had actually dared to increase the bargaining chip. Was he complaining that he didn\u2019t have a quick enough death? It seems his brain was truly wedged between a door.\u201cDidn\u2019t you win a membership card for the Big Dipper Training Center from the school\u2019s fighting competition? Use that as the wager. If I lose, I\u2019ll pay ten thousand Credits to you a month later. If you don\u2019t have the courage to wager, then forget it.\u201d Shi Feng provokingly said. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, Zhou Yuhu showed off this membership card in front of others. Now, Shi Feng could coincidentally use it to train his body. The Big Dipper Training Center was well known in Jin Hai City. It had a great environment, and its training facilities were very thorough. The average person was not allowed to enter the training center at all, not to mention obtaining a VIP membership there. A normal membership was worth around eight to nine thousand Credits.\u201cEven if I wager this card, where would a poor wretch like you find that much money? I won\u2019t believe in empty words,\u201d Zhou Yuhu laughed coldly.Indeed, it was as Zhou Yuhu had said. Shi Feng had not a penny on him at the moment, not to mention ten thousand Credits. Hence, why he had said he would pay a month later. However, Zhou Yuhu would clearly not believe him. Instead, Zhou Yuhu turned around to mock him. It would seem Shi Feng\u2019s plan was going to be dashed this time.\u201cShi Feng, did you think I don\u2019t know about your living conditions? You are so poor you can\u2019t even afford to have a good meal, yet you\u2019re still pretending to be wealthy,\u201d Qin Shuyu shot Shi Feng a glance, commenting in disdain.\u201cI\u2019ll pay the ten thousand Credits,\u201d Zhao Ruoxi abruptly said.Ling Feilong\u2019s eyes turned crimson when he saw Zhao Ruoxi standing up once again. He couldn\u2019t help but wish he could get rid of Shi Feng right this instant.Shi Feng was also shocked. He looked towards Zhao Ruoxi, astonished. He did not understand how Zhao Ruoxi had that much money. He wasn\u2019t very clear of Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s family background, either. Shi Feng only knew that her family was relatively well off. However, Zhao Ruoxi was actually so believing of him, even to the degree of betting her money on him. Shi Feng could not understand why she had done so. To begin with, the relationship between the two of them wasn\u2019t that great.Zhao Ruoxi looked at Shi Feng. She knew the reason for Shi Feng\u2019s astonishment. However, to not let him misunderstand, she quietly explained, \u201cI\u2019m only lending you the money because I can\u2019t stand Zhou Yuhu\u2019s arrogant attitude. I think highly of you, so even if you lose, lose with dignity.\u201d\u201cThank you. I will definitely return twice the amount to you,\u201d Shi Feng gratefully said.This money was very important to him. Now, Zhou Yuhu would definitely agree to the wager. After Shi Feng obtained the membership card, he would be able to regularly train his body.It was better to start training earlier, rather than later. The earlier Shi Feng could train his body, the larger the benefit it would have to his future. Zhao Ruoxi had helped him greatly this time. When he started earning money in God\u2019s Domain, paying Zhao Ruoxi an extra ten thousand would even be considered too little.However, Zhao Ruoxi did not take Shi Feng\u2019s words seriously. She only nodded with a smile. She did not think that Shi Feng could return her money, not to mention double the amount.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHahaha! Interesting! Then let\u2019s draw out the contract at the fighting arena!\u201d Zhou Yuhu licked his lips. He was even more interested in Zhao Ruoxi now. Although his luck in God\u2019s Domain was bad today, his luck in real life was truly good. Not only had he found a good looking girl, but he could also receive ten thousand Credits for teaching Shi Feng a lesson. It truly was a blessing in disguise.Following which, everyone arrived at the fighting arena built by the school. Shi Feng and Zhou Yuhu signed a contract under the supervision of the Central Brain. Contracts acknowledged by the Central Brain were also recognized by the law.There was also a judge at the fighting arena. The judge was normally a teacher in the university who taught students how to fight. The judge also had good skills that would be used to promptly stop the fights to avoid any heavy injuries from occurring.The other students from the class stood below the fighting ring. They laughed at Shi Feng\u2019s stupidity. Instead of being an invisible existence like usual, he actually went insane now. Not only did he oppose Ling Feilong, but he also angered Zhou Yuhu, who was even more terrifying. After today, Shi Feng might never live a peaceful life ever again.Qin Shuyu looked above the ring, at the calm and steady Shi Feng. The feeling he gave people was completely different from before. He currently radiated an indescribable sense of security. She even felt Shi Feng\u2019s scrawny body had grown larger. Qin Shuyu quickly shook her head, mockingly saying, \u201cHow strong could a weakling, who doesn\u2019t even know a single fighting technique, be? He even dares challenge Brother Hu now. He truly is reckless.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48 \u2013 An Unequaled FightNone of the students below the ring had refuted Qin Shuyu\u2019s words. Instead, they felt her words made sense.No matter what was said, Zhou Yuhu was ranked third in the university\u2019s fighting tournament. He was also highly praised by several teachers who taught fighting. They predicted Zhou Yuhu would be able to create a reputation for himself in the upcoming city\u2019s fighting tournament, not to mention teaching the weak and scrawny Shi Feng a lesson. It was like using a butcher\u2019s knife to kill a chicken.\u201cEven though he remains unyielding right now, I guess Shi Feng will kneel and beg for mercy in a moment.\u201d\u201cDoes that even need to be mentioned? Why don\u2019t you look at who Zhou Yuhu is? My guess is Shi Feng will be lying on the floor within ten seconds.\u201dThe male students in the class started to laugh as they discussed Shi Feng\u2019s end.\u201cWhat is wrong with you people? Is this how you treat a classmate of yours?\u201d Zhao Ruoxi asked, looking at her classmates with a furious expression.The students all turned silent. However, their eyes revealed a hint of disdain when they looked at Zhao Ruoxi.One of the gorgeously dressed girls in the class curled her lips in disdain, softly saying, \u201cYou just have somewhat good looks. If it wasn\u2019t for Brother Long, who do you think would listen to your words?\u201dThe other girls promptly nodded their heads. They were not taking their class monitor seriously at all.Although the female students spoke in soft tones, everyone present could hear them clearly. To the side, Ling Feilong felt invigorated as he enjoyed listening to their words.Zhao Ruoxi turned her head away in a rage, no longer paying attention to these people.Ling Feilong walked over to her and gently said, \u201cRuoxi, I know that you have no choice in this matter as the class monitor. However, Shi Feng is the one finding trouble here, so you can\u2019t just blame everyone. Moreover, nobody believes Shi Feng can win with that small body of his. You are literally throwing your money into the ocean. In a moment, I\u2019ll talk it over with Brother Hu to not take your money and let Shi Feng pay for everything.\u201d\u201cIndeed, I am helping Shi Feng because I am the class monitor. However, regarding the matter with the money, I have never thought of asking for it back from him.\u201d Zhao Ruoxi glanced at Ling Feilong, coldly saying, \u201cOn the other hand, you\u2019re the one who has taken the recommendation that is rightfully Shi Feng\u2019s. Instead of helping Shi Feng now, you\u2019re here making cynical remarks. Aren\u2019t you afraid of people criticizing you behind your back?\u201cAlso, how can this be considered \u2018trading pointers?\u2019 One is ranked third in the school, while the other is a student who doesn\u2019t even know any fighting techniques. Do you not feel any shame when you speak of this?\u201dZhao Ruoxi\u2019s every word caused Ling Feilong piercing pain. In addition, her elegant and refined complexion gave off an indescribable sense of strength that struck at Ling Feilong\u2019s heart. Ling Feilong was speechless as he turned pale from anger.Just as Zhao Ruoxi had said, every class had a fixed number of spots for the recommendation. Only students with results amongst the top twenty in the class were qualified for this recommendation. However, Ling Feilong had managed to obtain the qualifications to participate in the city\u2019s fighting competition after much difficulty. If others were to know that he was a university student without a recommendation, it would be an absolute humiliation.The school had previously considered such reputational problems, as well. Hence, they had made it so that the top five contestants of the fighting tournament would receive a recommendation, even if their studies were not good. However, Ling Feilong was only ninth-ranked, so naturally, he could not obtain it. Hence, he had suggested such a matter to the school. Seeing that Ling Feilong\u2019s results were in the top thirty of the class, not that far from the twentieth place, the school had decided to agree to his request. However, the condition was someone had to willingly give up their recommendation. As for how he would get someone to give up their spot, that all depended on Ling Feilong himself.Shi Feng was just a weakling. Originally, Ling Feilong had intended to utilize the collective intentions of the class, in addition to his own strength, to easily oppress Shi Feng. Then, after giving Shi Feng some benefits, this matter would be considered over. However, Shi Feng\u2019s actions were completely different from what Ling Feilong had imagined they would be. Shi Feng had not taken him seriously in the slightest and had threatened him without hesitation. Now, he was even ridiculed by Zhao Ruoxi. Ling Feilong\u2019s heart was currently filled with an inextinguishable wrath.\u201cCorrect, this isn\u2019t an equal fight. However, can Shi Feng blame others for being weak himself? Who was the one who agreed to this competition? Surely you can\u2019t blame me for this.\u201dLing Feilong looked at Zhao Ruoxi with blood-red eyes. If Zhao Ruoxi did not have a beautiful appearance and attractive body, he would have long since sent a slap flying over. However, he endured it. Using force was definitely not a smart move. Moreover, Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s family background was not simple at all. If he caused an incident now, his entire life would be over. Also, when Ling Feilong thought about how he could toy with Zhao Ruoxi in the future, the rage in his heart calmed down slightly.Brat, after making me take such a loss, just you wait and see, Ling Feilong glared at Shi Feng, silently swearing.Above, in the fighting ring, Shi Feng only smiled in disdain when he felt the hostility coming from Ling Feilong.However, he had to agree to one of Ling Feilong\u2019s words.This was indeed an uneven fight.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, although his physique was not comparable to those first-rate fighters, he could still beat them into submission. The thing he relied on to win was the life or death battles in God\u2019s Domain. What was a hundred-battle hero? After living through a hundred wars, it would be hard not to become an expert hero.It was the same with many martial artists. Their training usually involved pushing themselves to the edge, using the feeling of having their lives hanging by a thread to train and improve themselves. However, such a method was too dangerous. The average person would definitely not do such a thing. It was extremely easy to go overboard and lose their lives.After Shi Feng went through extremely realistic life or death battles, the increase to his battle experience and techniques rapidly grew. His skills in battle even exceeded the national fighting competition\u2019s standards by several levels.In ten years time, any reputable melee player in God\u2019s Domain could easily defeat the current fighting champion of Jin Hai City, not to mention Shi Feng, who was once the Captain of Shadow.In Shi Feng\u2019s eyes, the university\u2019s fighting tournament was just like children playing house. Moreover, regarding physique, his current body exceeded his body ten years later. Fighting would not be a problem, even if he had to face up to five or six Ling Feilong\u2019s.\u201cBrat, you sure are carefree to be looking around. Watch how I\u2019ll fix you up!\u201d Zhou Yuhu said, rushing at Shi Feng. He immediately sent a slap towards Shi Feng\u2019s face, intending to humiliate him first.Naturally, Shi Feng could easily see through such an action. However, Shi Feng stood unmoving even though he was facing off against someone much stronger than he was. Shi Feng sent out a casual punch towards Zhou Yuhu\u2019s face, completely ignoring Zhou Yuhu\u2019s slap.Zhou Yuhu never imagined that Shi Feng\u2019s fist would have such precision, aiming directly at his face. Instinctively, Zhou Yuhu had used his hands to block off this fist.Shi Feng\u2019s lips curled upwards when he saw Zhou Yuhu\u2019s actions. With lightning speed, Shi Feng\u2019s hand chopped towards Zhou Yuhu\u2019s neck. Zhou Yuhu failed to react in time as he received a chop to his neck. With the precision of a surgery blade, Shi Feng\u2019s hand hacked at a major artery in Zhou Yuhu\u2019s neck.Suddenly, Zhou Yuhu felt his vision blurring. There was a sense of suffocating as Zhou Yuhu felt all his strength leaving his body.Shi Feng did not give Zhou Yuhu time to catch his breath. Immediately, he sent another punch flying towards the side of Zhou Yuhu\u2019s abdomen. Zhou Yuhu wanted to block the attack, but his body refused to listen to his thoughts. He could only feel a stabbing pain in his intestines as a stream of yellowish liquid shot out from his mouth. Zhou Yuhu\u2019s vision became a blur. He could not cry out, even if he wanted to.Zhou Yuhu\u2019s body instinctively wished to fall, but Shi Feng did not give him such a chance. Fist after fist landed on Zhou Yuhu\u2019s abdomen, followed by a few more landing on his ribs. After receiving a series of consecutive punches, the acidic juices in Zhou Yuhu\u2019s stomach had been completely drained out of his mouth. Then, his body fell to the ground like a dead dog.The entire arena suddenly became silent.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEverything had happened all too quickly. It was so quick that not one person had even reacted.Only after Zhou Yuhu was laying on the ground, did the judge of the match finally react. Immediately, he declared the end of the fight and Shi Feng, the winner of it. At the same time, he hurriedly ran over to Zhou Yuhu\u2019s side to check on him.The judge truly could not imagine it. Zhou Yuhu, the third-ranking student in the university\u2019s fighting competition, was not even a match for such a weak-looking youth.By no means was Zhou Yuhu too weak. Instead, the weak-looking youth was just too strong. After watching several of Zhou Yuhu\u2019s matches, the judge knew that he was very strong. At the very least, it would not be easy for the judge to deal with him.After looking at Zhou Yuhu\u2019s injuries, the judge was dumbfounded. Shi Feng\u2019s techniques were just too horrifying. Every one of his moves was perfectly measured, breaking only two to three of Zhou Yuhu\u2019s ribs but not heavily injuring him. Zhou Yuhu only needed more than a month\u2019s time for his chest to heal up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49 \u2013 A New LightSeeing Zhou Yuhu unmoving on the ground, it was clear he had lost consciousness. The teacher then reported that Zhou Yuhu had no major injuries, and he would wake up in a moment. However, his injuries still needed to be tended to; also, he had to rest for more than a month.As for the city\u2019s fighting competition that would be held in three weeks, Zhou Yuhu could forget about joining.Everyone\u2019s sights shifted toward Shi Feng. They looked at his thin and weak body, sucking in a cold breath when they recalled the explosive and terrifying strength it was capable of displaying. When they thought about the words they said to Shi Feng before, cold sweat started pouring out from their backs without stop.Currently, the expression in the male students\u2019 eyes as they looked at Shi Feng had completely changed. There was no longer any ridicule or contempt contained within them. Instead, there was a deep fear. The third-ranking student in the school was actually defeated in a single exchange. Who else could become Shi Feng\u2019s opponent?If Shi Feng wished to take care of them, the consequences they would face would be unimaginable. On the other hand, they had actually dared to gift Shi Feng\u2019s recommendation to Ling Feilong.Thinking up to this point, the hearts of the hot-blooded warriors from before started to beat madly.Under the Central Brain\u2019s witness, Shi Feng received the membership card for the Big Dipper Training Center and ten thousand Credits. Following which, he circled a glance at the people below the ring. When a few of the less courageous male students were met with Shi Feng\u2019s deep and profound eyes, their legs suddenly turned weak as they lost consciousness, foam appearing at their mouths.\u201cTeacher, not good. Little Liu has fainted.\u201dBefore this sentence could finish being said, another male student lay flat on the ground\u2026Meanwhile, the male students that remained standing started becoming scared in their hearts. Shi Feng was just too terrifying. He actually shocked two male students into unconsciousness just by looking them in the eye. However, they were also envious of the two that lost consciousness. If they had fainted over, they wouldn\u2019t have to bear such a pressure right now. Currently, the air surrounding them was still, as if frozen. Breathing was starting to become a difficulty for them, and even their limbs felt heavy as if they were filled with lead.As for the female students in the class, they were all dumbfounded. Their heads quickly lowered when they saw Shi Feng looking over. They felt uncomfortable throughout their bodies as if they were frightened rabbits that were being stared at by a big gray wolf.Qin Shuyu\u2019s delicate mouth widened. She rubbed her eyes, verifying what she saw over and over. Only then did she understand that Zhou Yuhu was struck unconscious by Shi Feng. Shi Feng was just too powerful. Why had she never discovered so before?If she could be with a man such as this, her sense of security would be off the charts. Just thinking about it had made her happy. As for money, that would not be a problem. Just based on his strength alone, Shi Feng could definitely get into the city\u2019s fighting tournament. Entering into the top ten would also not be a problem. When that time came, there would definitely be many requests for him to become a celebrity spokesperson.When Qin Shuyu saw that Shi Feng was looking over, she slightly tidied up her clothes and hair, appearing neat and moving. She also revealed deep cleavage, feebly saying, \u201cBrother Feng, it\u2019s noon already. I know a good restaurant that has a great environment and good tasting food. I\u2019ll treat you; so, let\u2019s go there and have a try.\u201dHowever, Shi Feng did not pay Qin Shuyu any attention. Instead, he was looking for Zhao Ruoxi. When he found Zhao Ruoxi, he immediately walked over, completely ignoring Qin Shuyu.Seeing Shi Feng\u2019s cold and indifferent eyes, Qin Shuyu suddenly felt she had lost something very important. It was as if a knife stabbing at her heart. She regretted being blind and foolish when she was in high school.\u201cClass monitor, here\u2019s your ten thousand Credits. I\u2019ll repay the remaining ten thousand Credits as fast as I can.\u201d Shi Feng handed the money over, speaking with a calm smile.However, Zhao Ruoxi would not receive it. She blinked her attractive eyes as she looked at Shi Feng as if she was looking at an exotic animal. There was both shock and joy contained within them.\u201cAre you really Shi Feng?\u201d Zhao Ruoxi asked in a quiet and uncertain tone.Throughout Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s four years in university, her impression of Shi Feng was one of an introvert. He was often bullied by others. He also appeared very prideful, never receiving help from others. He was like an injured little wolf, licking his own wounds, alone.She had never imagined Shi Feng\u2019s actions today would have such a great difference from before. She now viewed Shi Feng in a completely new light. Shi Feng had turned from being a little wolf into a slumbering dragon; he was unassuming when slumbering, but amazing when he took action. Even Zhao Yuhu, the third-ranking student in the entire university, was no match for him. If he had entered the school\u2019s fighting tournament, he might have already become the champion by now.\u201cOf course I am Shi Feng. Class monitor, why would you ask such a question? Could it be that I am just too handsome and different from my previous appearance?\u201d Shi Feng joked. He naturally understood Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s thoughts. He had attracted too much attention today. However, even Shi Feng himself did not wish for such a situation to occur. The developments up to this point were all unintentional.\u201cTch, don\u2019t get cocky. You are just barely able to enter my eyes.\u201d Zhao Ruoxi immediately snatched the money from Shi Feng, her fair and delicate face revealing a calm smile. As if she had thought of something, she quietly said, \u201cThe Fellowship Party hosted by the university is in ten days. There will also be the upper echelons of well-known corporations in Jin Hai City attending the party. Aren\u2019t you trying to find a profitable career? This is a good chance, so you should consider attending.\u201dThe moment Zhao Ruoxi finished speaking, she thought of Shi Feng\u2019s financial situation. He definitely did not have the money to attend the party. Hence, she quietly said, \u201cAs for the fee required to participate in the Fellowship Party, I can pay it for you.\u201dShi Feng gave Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s words some thought. The Fellowship Party hosted by Jin Hai University annually was a big event, and that person might even participate in this party. Hence, Shi Feng nodded his head in agreement, saying, \u201cThank you, class monitor. I\u2019ll go. As for the participation fee, I\u2019ll pay that myself.\u201dZhao Ruoxi was slightly glad when she heard Shi Feng agreeing to go. However, there was an indescribable sense of disappointment when she heard Shi Feng saying that he would pay the participation fee on his own.The conversation between the two was also heard by everyone else. However, everyone doubted their hearing when they heard their class monitor, Zhao Ruoxi, actively invite Shi Feng to the Fellowship Party. She was even willing to pay for his participation fee.Zhao Ruoxi was a truly beautiful woman; only, she normally made no efforts to enhance her looks with makeup. Her clothing was also very common. However, it was still unable to mask her elegant and refined face and exquisite body. As long as she dressed herself up somewhat, even the school\u2019s top beauty might not be her match.Hence, there were quite a few rich and influential men who tried pursuing Zhao Ruoxi. However, every one of them was rejected. Ling Feilong was the only one who had managed to shorten the distance between them after much difficulty. However, it was only to the degree of getting Zhao Ruoxi to treat him somewhat better. Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s pridefulness was clear to behold. Now, however, Zhao Ruoxi had actively invited Shi Feng. It was an absolutely jaw-dropping scene.With such a beauty inviting them, who could refuse?However, Shi Feng had tactfully rejected Zhao Ruoxi\u2019s kind intentions.By the side, the wrathful flame in Ling Feilong\u2019s heart burned madly as he listened in on the two\u2019s conversation.\u201cShi Feng, one must properly know one\u2019s own worth. There will be many great figures of Jin Hai City attending the Fellowship Party. Just based on the clothes you are wearing, the security might even chase you away. At that time, you\u2019ll embarrass everyone in our class,\u201d Ling Feilong mockingly said.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this point, fellow student Ling Feilong.\u201d Shi Feng turned to look at Ling Feilong. He pointed towards the ring, a cold glint flashing past his eyes as he coldly said, \u201cOn the contrary, didn\u2019t you say you wanted to teach me how to become a proper person before? This place is the fighting arena; so why don\u2019t we exchange some pointers. Teach me how to become a proper person.\u201d\u201cShi Feng\u2026\u2026 you\u2026\u2026 don\u2019t get ahead of yourself. I am only following the suggestion of the entire class,\u201d Ling Feilong stuttered as he looked at Shi Feng with hesitant eyes. He suddenly felt chills throughout his body, inadvertently retreating a step back.Having him exchange pointers with Shi Feng was just digging his own grave. For those who have never participated in a fighting competition, they would not be able to know the true meaning and horror of the exchange between Shi Feng and Zhou Yuhu. Zhou Yuhu was very powerful, and even Ling Feilong himself knew he was definitely not a match to Zhou Yuhu. However, Zhou Yuhu was still dispatched by Shi Feng within a moment. This fight could not even be considered a proper fight. It was just a one-sided play.\u201cThe suggestion of the entire class?\u201d Shi Feng swept a glance towards his classmates standing to the side, coldly saying, \u201cWhat were your suggestions?\u201dNaturally, everyone would not stand on Ling Feilong\u2019s side. Even an idiot could tell how afraid Ling Feilong was of Shi Feng.\u201cFine, I admit defeat. It was I who was blind. You tell me what\u2019s to be done.\u201d Ling Feilong looked above the ring at the unconscious Zhou Yuhu, gritting his teeth while saying. If he were to come into conflict with Shi Feng right now, he would not have any chance of resisting. He also did not believe that Shi Feng would show mercy. If he had continued offending Shi Feng, he would definitely be laying on a hospital bed for at least a month. When that time came, he would not be able to even participate in the city\u2019s fighting tournament, and such a loss was not something he was willing to bear.\u201cThe five thousand Credits voucher for the Big Dipper Training Center awarded by the school,\u201d Shi Feng demanded. The Big Dipper had the best nutritionist in Jin Hai City. With this voucher, Shi Feng could replenish the nutrients required by his body and quickly improve his physique.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLing Feilong was extremely unwilling to give away the Big Dipper voucher. This was an item that could not be bought outside, even with ten thousand Credits\u2026After receiving the voucher, Shi Feng left the fighting arena.Shi Feng started training his body immediately after returning to his rented apartment. After tiring himself out, he looked for information related to God\u2019s Domain and Jin Hai City on the internet. He was making ample preparations for his future development plan.It was especially true for the Fellowship Party this time around. He had to prepare sufficient information before the Fellowship started. Otherwise, it would be too hard to carry out his plan.When noon came, Shi Feng ate his lunch and lay on the bed. He wore his Virtual Gaming Helmet, starting his second day in God\u2019s Domain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50 \u2013 The Popular Garrison ArmorDark clouds hovered over the skies of Red Leaf Town, surrounding the full moon that hung in midair. On the streets, magic lamps brightly lit up the town.Shi Feng had just logged in.It was still nighttime in God\u2019s Domain. A majority of the players were currently in the Trade Area, making the place very crowded. There were only a scant few experts who would hunt for monsters to level up at this time of day.During the daytime, the street of the Trade Area was desolate. However, that street had currently turned into a bazaar, bustling with noise and excitement. Players could be seen setting up stalls throughout the wide cobblestone street, and above their white sheets of cloth were some items required by Auxiliary Jobs and also a few pieces of Common Equipment. Buyers and sellers were bargaining with each other, and some faces eve turned crimson over one or two Coppers.System: The Garrison Armor you have placed on auction has been sold. After deducting the processing fees, a total of 5 Silvers 31 Coppers has been added to your inventory.System: The Garrison Armor you have placed on auction has been sold.

After deducting the processing fees, a total of 5 Silvers 98 Coppers has been added to your inventory.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Before Shi Feng had taken a step forward, a series of Auction House notifications from the System entered his ears. Shi Feng casually selected the System Notifications to appear, immediately becoming shocked.The Garrison Armor\u2019s value had totally exceeded Shi Feng\u2019s estimates. Originally, Shi Feng intended to have it sold for, more or less, 5 Silvers. In reality, however, due to the competition in price growing fiercer, the Garrison Armor reached a maximum price of 6 Silvers 42 Coppers. The eleven Garrison Armors sold for a total of over 67 Silver Coins. The amount immediately turned Shi Feng into the owner of a Gold Coin. He had become a Gold-a-naire.At the current phase of the game, the purchasing power of a single Silver Coin was astonishing. For a second-rate Guild, their circulating funds would only amount to sixty or seventy Silver Coins. To properly develop their normal members during the initial periods of the game, the Guilds were unable to stock up on too many Copper Coins. Such an action would only hamper the Guild\u2019s future development. As for first-rate Guilds, their circulating funds might only be around one Gold Coin. However, these funds would seem insignificant when it was used on tens or hundreds of people.Now, Shi Feng was a true tycoon.After a day of battle, a majority of the players were currently returning to Town with their spoils of war. These players carried a lot of materials on their persons, and naturally, Shi Feng would not let this chance get away. Shi Feng casually chose a location with few people, setting his white cloth on the ground and starting up his stall to purchase materials.The highest leveled player right now should be at Level 4, whereas the average player was still at Level 2 and expert players at Level 3. Hence, the materials they sold varied greatly; there were high ranking goods, and there were also common goods.The current prices for high ranking materials were very expensive, so Shi Feng would naturally not buy them. Shi Feng relied solely on himself to make the Garrison Armor, so the money he could earn was limited. However, Shi Feng was just selling these pieces of equipment to accumulate some funds. Only when he had the funds could he earn more money.\u201cBuying Magic Essence, 6 Coppers a stack; Stones, 10 Coppers a stack. Also buying Hard Stones, 23 Coppers a stack,\u201d Shi Feng shouted.After hearing Shi Feng\u2019s words, the players on the street crowded around him, one after another.\u201cBoss, I have 10 stacks of Stones. How many stacks do you want?\u201d\u201cI have 6 stacks of Magic Essence; do you want all of them?\u201d\u201cI have a stack of Hard Stones.\u201dAfter grinding in the wild for an entire day, Magic Essences and Stones had become materials that polluted the street. Normally, players would sell these materials to NPCs or save them up for practicing their own Auxiliary Jobs. However, materials such as Hard Stones were very rare. They were usually found in Level 3 areas, only being dropped by Kobolds or Little Rock Monsters.There were twenty pieces of Hard Stones in a stack, and they were worth 20 Coppers when sold to NPCs. Hard Stones were used in forging; however, it was quite luxurious to use them at this stage of the game. Guilds very rarely purchased Hard Stones, so their prices were not very high. However, they would have a great purpose once players reached Level 7. There were many special monsters in the Level 7 monster areas, and it was extremely taxing on the durability of a weapon to fight against these monsters. A weapon would break when its durability reached zero. Once a weapon was broken, the chance of successfully repairing it was only around 20%. If failed, it would turn into scrap.Meanwhile, Hard Stones could be used to make Whetstones. When used on a weapon, it could temporarily increase its damage. More importantly, it could recover a weapon\u2019s durability by 5 to 10 points. With the Whetstone, players did not have to return to town just to repair their weapons, saving them a lot of time and also increasing their monster grinding efficiency.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, Hard Stones were sold with extreme popularity. The price of Whetstones increased with even greater speed, allowing many forgers to make a hefty profit. To quickly increase their levels and gain an advantage, Shadow Guild had also been butchered by those sharks. They could only grit their teeth as they bought the Whetstones.In this life, it was Shi Feng\u2019s turn to make a huge profit. He was going to stock up these Hard Stones in advance.After purchasing materials for over an hour, Shi Feng had a total of eighty stacks of Magic Essence and 120 stacks of Stones. As for Hard Stones, Shi Feng had only collected 12 stacks of them a very small amount.Shi Feng\u2019s bag was quickly filled.He had no choice but to make a trip to the Bank\u2019s warehouse to store all these items.The Bank\u2019s warehouse had a fixed space of 500 slots. Expanding the warehouse\u2019s space for the first time would give an additional 500 slots at the cost of 20 Coppers. The second time was 1000 slots for 50 Coppers. Afterward, every 1000 slots would cost 1 Silver Coin, and every additional thousand slots would result in a management fee of 10 Copper Coins per week.Currently, such an amount of money was nothing to Shi Feng. Immediately, Shi Feng expanded three thousand slots, and in the future, he would have to pay a processing fee of 30 Coppers every week.After storing all the materials, Shi Feng ran towards the Auction House.The Auction House linked together all the small Towns under the influence of White River City. Although there were few people who sold common materials here, there would surely still be some people who sold Hard Stones. Only, the prices they set were slightly higher.However, players would have no choice but to buy Whetstones for their weapons when they reached Level 7. So, Shi Feng wasn\u2019t concerned about the loss of money.After arriving at the Auction House, Shi Feng discovered a very peculiar situation. There were quite a lot of logistics members of Guilds present at the Auction House. Each and every one of them were standing guard at the Auction House, and it was a wonder what they were actually waiting for.Shi Feng randomly chose a place to sit down, calling out the operating panel of the Auction House.Just when Shi Feng was searching for Hard Stones, he heard a few logistics members of Guilds complaining to each other.\u201cHow long more do we have to wait?! Why is that Garrison Armor still not showing up?! Let me buy it so I can report back!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019ve only waited for three hours. I\u2019ve already been waiting here for more than ten hours. You haven\u2019t seen the intensity of the competition for the Garrison Armor. I\u2019ve heard, because of this Garrison Armor, there were quite a few Guilds who were able to kill many wild Special Elites, reaping astonishing gains. There was even a Guild that managed to obtain quite a few pieces of equipment and skill books, thanks to the Garrison Armor. So, everyone is here to fight over it. Unfortunately, the remaining few pieces of Garrison Armor have all been bought.\u201d\u201cExactly! Our Guild is currently regretting it dearly. If we had known how greatly we would fall behind to those Guilds, we would have bought the Garrison Armor, even if we had to pay 7 Silver Coins for one. Now, the higher-ups have already given the order. As long as the Garrison Armor appears, we definitely must buy it!\u201dDuring the discussion held by the logistic members, Shi Feng was also surprised by the speed of the Garrison Armor achieving his desired effect.Hence, Shi Feng took out the remaining seven Garrison Armor that possessed Defensive Power. He stealthily placed them on auction, setting the base price for each piece at 8 Silver Coins; 2 Silver Coins higher than his original estimation. However, these Guilds should be able to accept such a price. As for the best Garrison Heavy Armor, Shi Feng would only sell it after a period of time has passed. He would first let these Guilds slowly digest the current Garrison Armor.After placing the equipment on Auction, Shi Feng started searching for Hard Stones. Shi Feng wondered if there were many players who had auctioned them off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51 \u2013 Competition at the Auction HouseShi Feng called out the Search Panel, immediately entering the words \u2018Hard Stone.\u2019Suddenly, rows of information appeared on the semi-transparent screen.In a single glance, Shi Feng could see over a hundred stacks of Hard Stones being sold. There were many players selling them. When Shi Feng saw a stack of Hard Stones selling for 1 Gold Coin, he felt such a player must have been driven insane by poverty. Immediately, Shi Feng filtered the display to show prices from lowest to highest.After adjusting the display, the cheapest stack of Hard Stones still cost 26 Coppers. After deducting the processing fees of the Auction House, players could still receive 25 Coppers. As expected, the prices were a lot higher than normal.However, Shi Feng still had to buy them. He could afford them as long as the price was below 30 Coppers.Suddenly, the number of Hard Stones available on the Auction House had been reduced by a large half. The remaining ones were all selling for 30 Coppers and above, and there was no spendthrift who would buy them.After looking at Hard Stones, Shi Feng casually took at the miscellaneous section.Shi Feng\u2019s eyes abruptly shone. There were actually Card Sets. Moreover, there was a large number of them. There was some chance for monsters to drop these Card Sets; however, the drop rate for it was extremely low. There was not even a ten thousand to one chance for one to drop. Monsters below Level 10 were able to drop twelve Card Sets, and they were divided into two ranks: Bronze Rank and Mysterious-Iron Rank.Warriors had Steel, Crusaders, and Insanity.Weapons Specialists had Chaos, Vengeance, and Hurricane.Healers had Divine, Nature, and Noble.Mages had Element, Fool, and Demon.These twelve Card Sets each represented the twelve different Jobs. Every set had nine cards in them, and each card had a number behind them. As long as a player could gather a complete set, they could exchange it for a piece of Set Equipment for the respective Job.Back in those days, a majority of the players did not know what these Card Sets were for. Moreover, there was no introduction for these Card Sets. Players, at that time, simply kept these Card Sets in their bags or sold them at the Auction House. Only when the Normal Mode of the fifty-man Level 10 Dungeon near the city was cleared, did these players discovered there was actually an NPC that would trade for these Card Sets. Depending on the rank of the Card Sets, they could be traded for either Bronze or Mysterious-Iron Set Equipment.These Set Equipment were absolutely marvelous. A Bronze Set of Equipment could rival an entire regular set of Mysterious-Iron Equipment, whereas a Mysterious-Iron Set of Equipment could rival an entire regular set of Secret-Silver Equipment. So, these Card Sets that nobody cared about before suddenly turned ragingly popular overnight. Every card was sold at an astronomical price. Even so, many Guilds were still frantic over them, constantly purchasing them.Meanwhile, there were hundreds of Card Sets currently displayed in front of Shi Feng, yet there was actually nobody who wanted them. Each card was being sold at no more than 5 Coppers, and even the maximum was 7 Coppers.Shi Feng bought them clean without hesitation. Shi Feng did not think much of the cost. What\u2019s more, they would not increase in value even, if he had left them in his bag. Using the money to grow money, now that was the way of the king.After Shi Feng was finished with collecting Hard Stones and Card Sets, he was left with no more than 14 Silver Coins.Following which, Shi Feng searched for skill books through the Search Panel. To determine a player\u2019s strength in God\u2019s Domain, other than looking at their equipment, the number of skills they had learned was another factor. If a player possessed many skills, they could have a large variety of attack patterns to use in battle. An expert Swordsman could usually utilize more than twenty skills in battle, whereas first-rate experts could use more than forty skills in battle. As for the top-tier experts, they did not need to be mentioned.Shi Feng was a first-rate expert, yet, he possessed less than ten skills. His condition was truly pathetic\u2026However, there were very few skill books currently being sold. Under normal circumstances, players would usually use skill books on themselves or trade them for a skill they were able to use.Shi Feng went through more than ten pages in one go. As long as he saw a skill usable by Swordsmen, he immediately bought them. When Shi Feng arrived at the final page, his mind turned blank.\u201cAre you kidding me? Even [Defensive Blade] is being sold?\u201d Shi Feng went wild with joy.The Defensive Blade was a Swordsman\u2019s powerhouse skill. It was also a sure-kill skill when dealing with Mages. However, the skill also had a damnable drop rate. Even in his previous life, Shi Feng only managed to get his hands on the skill after he was well over Level 40. Shi Feng truly did not imagine he would be able to see it now.Although the selling price was slightly high, 6 Silvers was still acceptable to Shi Feng.Shi Feng immediately placed a bid of 7 Silver Coins, not wanting to waste too much time.Very quickly, Shi Feng bought the skill for 7 Silver Coins.With the current purchasing power of 7 Silver Coins, Shi Feng could buy five to six Basic skill books. However, Shi Feng spent them all on Defensive Blade without batting an eyelid.In addition to buying the Rare Skill, Defensive Blade, Shi Feng also purchased three Common Skills: Observing Eyes, Windwalk, and Earth Splitter. On another note, while Shi Feng was joyous over his purchase, the situation at the Auction House started turning frantic.The logistic members of the various Guilds were all crimson to their ears, their rage soaring to the skies.\u201cCrap, 9 Silver Coins still isn\u2019t enough to get this equipment?! Which rich Guild is it that bade 10 Silver Coins?\u201d\u201cYou animals, why don\u2019t you take a look at my side? Someone\u2019s already bid 10 Silvers and 65 coppers. These people are absolutely insane. I\u2019ve only brought 10 Silver Coins with me. What should I do now that I can\u2019t complete my task?\u201d\u201cAbominable! They\u2019re hiding their names and placing only these few pieces of equipment on auction; how can I even snatch one?!\u201dThese people were the logistics members of unrated Guilds. They were on the brink of insanity when they saw the larger Guilds\u2019 bid, each higher than the other. The most abominable person, however, was the creator of the equipment. Every time, this person only auctioned a few pieces of equipment. Previously, the competition over the equipment was already sufficiently intense. However, the Garrison Armor being auctioned right now had even better Attributes, and their numbers were even less. The money they brought along to bid was absolutely insufficient; so how were they going to fight for the equipment?\u201cIt can\u2019t be, right? Are there that many tycoons? Someone actually bid 11 Silvers.\u201d Shi Feng\u2019s joy reached the tips of his brows when he looked at how the Garrison Armor\u2019s price continuously increased. Within moments, the money he spent before had all been recovered, to the extent that it was more than before.Suddenly, Shi Feng thought of the Defensive Blade. The average player definitely had no chance of obtaining such a rare skill for Swordsmen, whereas Guilds would not sell it, even if they obtained it. The skill must have been sold by a certain Guild to collect funds to buy the Garrison Armor. It\u2019s just that their actions once again benefited Shi Feng.Within moments, all seven Garrison Armors had their prices increased past 11 Silvers. Such a price shocked even Shi Feng, himself. Where did so many powerful Guilds suddenly come from? With the financial resources of such Guilds, they ought to not spend that much money on a piece of Bronze Equipment.However, what Shi Feng did not know was, after he had placed the Garrison Armors on auction, the logistics members of various large Guilds reported the situation back to their Guild Leaders. Previously, these Guild Leaders saw the MT of other Guilds tanking Special Elites with the Garrison Armor. These MTs were able to allow the other players to attack the Special Elites with ease, obtaining various skill books and Bronze Equipment, Mysterious-Iron Equipment even. At such a sight, the eyes of these Guild Leaders had long since turned red with envy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUnfortunately, they had no solutions to this matter. They wished to let the Lifestyle players of their own respective Guilds forge this equipment, yet they did not have the Forging Design for it. They also wished to contact the player who had forged these Garrison Armors, yet this player had hidden his name, preventing any means of contact. Their only choice was to watch on, helplessly. Now, however, the Garrison Armor, this time, even possessed Defensive Power. They definitely must buy it. Hence, these Guilds started gathering funds immediately.\u201cDo you hear me; you definitely must get it! Immediately bid 13 Silver Coins! I want to see who else dares to bid.\u201d\u201cWhat? Is it already at 13 Silvers? Bid 13 Silvers 50 Coppers. I don\u2019t believe there is a Guild that is wealthier than us.\u201dThere were over a hundred Towns under the influence of White River City, and there were hundreds of Guilds continuously bidding for the Garrison Armor. After half an hour, all seven Garrison Armors were auctioned off, with the lowest being sold at 14 Silvers 60 Coppers. Shi Feng earned more than one Gold Coin in an instant. Seeing how fervent these people were, Shi Feng took the chance to place the Garrison Heavy Armor on auction, setting its starting price at 16 Silver Coins. Following which, Shi Feng left the Auction House.It was still night, and there was about half an hour before sunrise. It was very unwise to go out and level right now, so Shi Feng went to the library in Red Leaf Town first. He wanted to have a better understanding of the diary, which contained elvish words, he obtained from the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest. He might even obtain a new find.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52 \u2013 Holy SisterThe journey to Red Leaf Town\u2019s Library was very dangerous. If a normal player went there, there was a 30% chance for that person to die once. As for the remaining seventy percent, he would die many times.Hence, before heading to the Library, Shi Feng stored all the Hard Stones and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone into the Bank. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone would drop after death. If Shi Feng had unexpectedly died on the way to the Library, then it would be a major loss.Following which, Shi Feng took out the four skill books he bought previously and chose to learn them.[Observing Eyes]Able to see clearly unknown and concealed targets.

Duration of 25 seconds.Cooldown: 3 minutes.With these new skills, Shi Feng\u2019s survivability and attack potential greatly increased; thus, the danger of him going to the Library was no longer great.Red Leaf Town\u2019s Library was distanced far from the Trade Area. It was located in Red Leaf Town\u2019s Slums.The Slums were the second most popular location after the Trade Area. There were all sorts of people there, and it was a place where crooks mixed with the honest folk. It was also the favorite visiting location of some players, and this was due to the Slums\u2019 alternative name\u2026\u2026Paradise of the Fallen!The moment Shi Feng entered the domain of this paradise, from the corners of the street, he discovered eyes filled with greed directed at him. These were the rats hidden in the darkness, the ones unaccepted by the light, and the wanderers of hell\u2019s boundaries.There was bound to be a portion of players in God\u2019s Domain that was different from ordinary person. They were neither interested in conquering Dungeons, nor were they interested in the excitement that came from adventuring and risking one\u2019s self. The only thing these players were interested in, was banditry. They would kill other players and plunder their equipment; then, they would sell it to others for a high price, making a bountiful amount of money.During daytime, these players would hunt for and plunder the players with good equipment. At night, they would return to the Slums to dispose of their stolen goods then party with the money they just earned. They would brag about their harvest to display their own strength, using the chance to elevate their position in the Slums. Ordinary players would never set foot in this place. If they did not possess sufficient strength, the only result would be a return via death. The reason being this location was not protected by the Guards.Shi Feng simply glanced at the players hidden at the corners of the street. He discovered the indicators for all of these players were colored red. It was clear to see that they had done many kill-and-plunder deeds\u2026Within God\u2019s Domain, Red Players were not allowed to enter guarded areas. The equipment drop rate upon death for these players were also increased, and the penalty for death may be increased up to a maximum of 300%. Moreover, they would be apprehended and jailed by the Guards if they were to enter guarded areas, and the duration they were jailed depended on their Crime Value. However, even with all these disadvantages, there were still many players who had chosen to go down this path. After all, the rewards came very quickly this way. Red Players also had a place they could stay in Red Leaf Town. For example, the Slums. Moreover, if one wished to receive a good Quest in the Slums, one had to be a Yellow Player or even a Red Player.Regarding these players who lived on the edge of a knife, Shi Feng paid no attention to them. He immediately headed towards the main road of the Slums. On both sides of the street, there were quite a few flirty ladies dressed in revealing clothes. When they noticed the clothing Shi Feng was dressed in, they started flinging coquettish glances at his direction. They wanted to spend a pleasant night with Shi Feng, earning some Coin along the way.\u201cLittle brother, are you here for some fun? Come over here to big sister. Big sister guarantees that you will have a pleasant night,\u201d an alluring lady dressed in vibrant red leather clothing blocked Shi Feng\u2019s way.Shi Feng immediately used Observing Eyes.[Sharlyn] (Elite Rank)Level 8HP 1200/1200\u201cHahaha, Sharlyn, you\u2019re trying to sneak a bite again. How can you not invite us to such a happy occasion,\u201d a group of robust and fiendish men walked over, each of them carrying a cold grin on their faces.\u201cIs this a robbery?\u201d Shi Feng took a look at his surroundings, calmly asking. He discovered himself already surrounded by NPCs. There were also a few Red Players by the corner of a broken house, sneers on their faces.In God\u2019s Domain, it was very common for players to be robbed by NPCs. Moreover, it was also not Shi Feng\u2019s first time being robbed by NPCs. The incident that left the deepest impression on him was when he was at Creation Mountain Range. It was there that he was robbed by an NPC Warlord. At that time, Shi Feng could only helplessly pay out a road toll.Currently, before him, there was a Level 8 Elite NPC in addition to a group of Level 7 Common NPCs. It was a scene very commonly to the Slums, but Shi Feng had nobody to blame but himself for coming to this place.\u201cBrat, since you look like an upright person, we won\u2019t trouble you too much. Hand out 5 Silver Coins, and we\u2019ll let you pass. Otherwise, we\u2019ll personally take action,\u201d a scarred man said with a sneer.\u201cThen come over here and get it,\u201d Shi Feng sneered as he pulled out the Abyssal Blade.If you were to pay the road toll, then congratulations. Not only would you lose your money, but you also had to lose your life. You would lose at least a piece of equipment that was on your person. This was the reason why normal players had a 30% percent chance of dying once in the Slums. If you wanted these NPCs that wandered the boundaries of darkness to uphold their promise, there was definitely something broken with your brain.Sharlyn\u2019s attractive face revealed a trace of malevolence.\u201cBrat, you are courting death!\u201d a Level 7 blade-wielding man rushed at Shi Feng.Shi Feng stabbed the Abyssal Blade towards the man without hesitation.Double Chop, Chop, Thundering Flash, Earth Splitter\u2026 Sword slash after sword slash pierced through the man\u2019s neck and heart. With a body fully geared with Bronze Equipment, combined with the Abyssal Blade\u2019s Attack Power, Shi Feng\u2019s attacks had immediately reduced the man\u2019s 750 HP down to zero.\u201cStill want to continue?\u201d Shi Feng glanced at the surrounding NPCs, sneering.The NPCs were all shocked by Shi Feng. They all parted and gave way to Shi Feng, one after another. Meanwhile, the players hiding in a corner were also shocked. Shi Feng had killed off a Level 7 NPC in just a few moves. This player was just too strong! Naturally, these players would not find trouble with a player whom they knew was strong. In the Slums, strength was everything. Stealthily, these players left the scene of the incident.Only Sharlyn stayed behind with an interested expression.\u201cLittle brother, you are really powerful. You\u2019ve made big sister truly admire you. I wonder where you are headed? Big sister can guide you there and save you a lot of trouble, whereas you only have to pay a very small price,\u201d Sharlyn walked towards Shi Feng, offering with a calm smile.\u201cNo need to trouble yourself. I\u2019m familiar with the way to the Library,\u201d Shi Feng did not wish to get entangled with these NPCs. He only wished to search for clues regarding the Elven diary.Sharlyn smiled with even more joy when she heard Shi Feng decline.\u201cI am the Librarian, Sharlyn. You can ask me matters regarding the Library. There is no one more familiar with it than myself,\u201d Sharlyn puffed out her prided twin peaks, smiling sweetly.\u201cIsn\u2019t Red Leaf Town\u2019s Librarian a Holy Sister?\u201d Shi Feng did not believe her.\u201cOh? Are you talking about this?\u201d Sharlyn took out a set of nun\u2019s clothing and changed into it within an instant. Suddenly, her wild demeanor completely vanished. She was like an angel that had descended to the world, incomparably divine. Her presence made others desire repentance before her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the same time, the information that Sharlyn displayed had changed.[Holy Sister Sharlyn] (Divine Official)Level 20HP 10,000/10,000Shi Feng was also shocked. What kind of situation was this? Even NPCs had a side job?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53 \u2013 Darkness DescendsShi Feng was still slightly unable to accept Sharlyn\u2019s makeover.However, Shi Feng could be considered lucky for being able to meet the rumored Librarian. According to the information he knew, the Librarian of Red Leaf Town was full of mystery her whereabouts unknown. Shi Feng never imagined the Librarian to be the female NPC who participated in a robbery against him. If Shi Feng had truly started a fight with Sharlyn just now, the consequences would be unimaginable.What did playing the pig to eat the tiger mean?Sharlyn was definitely a veteran in this field.Divine Official was the Tier 3 Job Advancement for an Oracle. In the case of Swordsman, it was called Sword King, whereas between these two was the Sword Master. Even if a Divine Official was only Level 20, she could still easily dispatch a Level 50 Lord. Perhaps, Sharlyn was the most powerful NPC in all of Red Leaf Town.\u201cHehe, do you believe me now?\u201d Sharlyn giggled at Shi Feng. Her entire body radiated a golden glow as if she were the reincarnation of Mother Mary. \u201cSince you have some business with me, let\u2019s talk about it at the Library.\u201dSystem: Player has activated the Epic Quest, \u2018Darkness Descends.\u2019 Contents unknown.Shi Feng stumbled suddenly when he heard the system notification, nearly falling.What was the reason for him to actually trigger this Epic Quest? \u2018Darkness Descends\u2019 was the famous Epic Quest of God\u2019s Domain. From the information he collected from the internet and Shadow, the difficulty for completing this Epic Quest was truly unimaginable. Of course, the rewards were also unimaginably bountiful. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, the person who completed this Epic Quest was the Spirit Emperor, Fantasy Extinguisher. He was a legendary character amongst Summoners. He was globally ranked within the top twenty Summoners and top five hundred in the entire game during the peak of God\u2019s Domain.Although he was only ranked within the top five hundred within God\u2019s Domain, it should not be looked down upon. The entire world had a total population of one hundred billion. Although there were only one hundred million players in God\u2019s Domain currently, this number would increase past ten billion in a year. In three years, the number of players playing God\u2019s Domain would go past thirty billion.Being able to rank within the top five hundred, Fantasy Extinguisher was definitely an amazing expert.However, the thing that made Shi Feng feel odd was why this Epic Quest was found here. Fantasy Extinguisher\u2019s starting location was not in Star-Moon Kingdom. Instead, it was in Black Dragon Empire, which was far from Star-Moon Kingdom. Black Dragon Empire was far more powerful than Star-Moon Kingdom. Its landmass was three times that of Star-Moon Kingdoms. The competition between players and Guilds there was much fiercer.\u201cCould it be a reward for getting the First Clear on the Hell Mode of a Dungeon?\u201dShi Feng silently guessed as he followed Sharlyn. He felt it was a great possibility. Otherwise, why would an Epic Quest that should be found in Black Dragon Empire be found here in Star-Moon Kingdom?At this moment, Shi Feng\u2019s system communication rang. Shi Feng took a look at the caller, learning it was Gentle Snow contacting him.\u201cMiss Snow, do you have business with me?\u201d\u201cSeeing that you\u2019re logged on, I have something to tell you,\u201d Gentle Snow spoke in a very indifferent tone. She was like mysterious ice, unchanging even after ten thousand years and had no interest towards anything at all. \u201cI\u2019m in need of money to purchase something, so I might need more time to return the 15 Silvers that I owe you. At the latest, I will return it to you by the end of today.\u201d\u201cAlright. If you are really in a bind, tomorrow is fine as well,\u201d Shi Feng calmly replied. He no longer paid any heed to the 15 Silver Coins Gentle Snow owed him. Currently, he had more than one Gold Coin on his person, and he was troubled over how to spend it.Gentle Snow was slightly surprised by Shi Feng\u2019s indifference even toward that much money. However, since Shi Feng had already said so, naturally, she would not be courteous to him. She softly thanked him, saying, \u201cThank you. However, aren\u2019t you afraid I won\u2019t return it, causing you to lose everything?\u201d\u201cYou are the Snow Goddess. Why would you even try to cheat an average player of such a small amount of money?\u201d Shi Feng said with a grin.\u201cAverage? You dare call yourself \u2018average?\u2019 Even I am shocked by the map and strategy you provided. We only spent an hour to clear the Normal Mode of the Deathly Forest, then went on to clear Hard Mode as well. Unfortunately, Hell Mode is just too hard. We could not clear it, no matter what.\u201d Gentle Snow faintly smiled, saying, \u201cI am very curious as to how you all managed to clear Hell Mode. If you said it was due to your party members\u2019 help, I would not believe you. .\u201dTo conquer the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest, she especially rushed over Elite members of Ouroboros from other Towns. However, they couldn\u2019t get past the first Chieftain-rank Boss, Willie, no matter what they did. Willie\u2019s damage was especially terrifying. Even a Shield Warrior fully equipped with Bronze Equipment could not tank it. Gentle Snow truly could not understand how Shi Feng\u2019s party had cleared Hell Mode.\u201cJust lucky,\u201d Shi Feng honestly said.\u201cSince you don\u2019t want to say it, I still have to fight over a piece of equipment; so, I won\u2019t speak with you any longer. Don\u2019t forget our Dungeon appointment.\u201d Gentle Snow did not continue pursuing Shi Feng about how he was able to clear Hell Mode. Just Hard Mode alone gave them a great harvest.\u201cFight over equipment? Is it the Garrison Heavy Armor?\u201d Shi Feng casually asked.\u201cEn, how did you know? Are you also fighting for this equipment?\u201d Gentle Snow nodded her head while saying. The Attributes for this Garrison Heavy Armor was too great. If they had this piece of equipment, there would not be much trouble when they entered the Level 3 Wolfman Dungeon.Shi Feng knew he had said too much, but he remained calm as he replied, \u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t think there would be that many people competing for it. I\u2019ve already given up on it by now.\u201d\u201cIndeed. The price has already reached 23 Silver Coins, and only a Guild with strong funding will be able to buy it. I won\u2019t speak with you any longer. I still need to sell some items,\u201d Gentle Snow disconnected the call after finishing her piece.Meanwhile, Zhao Yueru, who sat beside Gentle Snow, pouted her delicate lips. She kicked up a fuss, complaining, \u201cSnow, why must you let that bastard join our team, no matter what? That bastard was just lucky, and his skills are just average. He coincidentally encountered a small Dungeon like the Deathly Forest that did not change much since the game\u2019s official release, and he very luckily cleared the Hell Mode of the Dungeon. It would be pointless bringing him into the twenty-man Team Dungeon. Also, the skill levels of his party members are just too miserable to even look at. They would definitely become a burden to our progress.\u201dThe Elite members of Ouroboros standing behind Gentle Snow also agreed with Zhao Yueru\u2019s words. They were the Elites of Ouroboros. How could a group of average players compare to them?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI feel that Big Brother Ye Feng is not that simple. He was definitely humble when he said he cleared the Dungeon due to luck. His skills are amazing, so it wouldn\u2019t be disadvantageous inviting him to join us,\u201d Xiao Yue\u2019er softly offered her personal opinion.\u201cLittle girl, what do you know about liars? You just don\u2019t know how bad that bastard is. Also, he spent that much time just reaching Level 1. His skills are only so-so. This lady can instakill him with a single Flame Explosion,\u201d Zhao Yueru gave Xiao Yue\u2019er a stare, speaking confidently.\u201cAlright, stop arguing. I, too, feel Ye Feng is not that simple. Otherwise, how could he clear the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest with a group of novices? When we enter the Team Dungeon, we will see where his standards lay. If he is not bad, I might consider recruiting him into the God-Slaying Army. Now, however, let\u2019s first bid on this Garrison Heavy Armor,\u201d Gentle Snow let out a soft cough.Everyone abruptly became silent, astonished. They never imagined that Gentle Snow would have such considerations. She was actually planning to let Ye Feng join the God-Slaying Army. The members of the God-Slaying Army were the Elites amongst the Elites of Ouroboros. Each member had great skill, and they were experts who were selected out of tens of thousands of players. All of the Guild\u2019s resources were prioritized on the God-Slaying Army. Aside from the Guild Leader and Sub-Leader, members of the God-Slaying Army had the most authority within the Guild.Many experts in the virtual world struggled tirelessly to join the God-Slaying Army. However, a large majority of these people were all rejected. On the other hand, Ye Feng, who suddenly appeared before them, actually possessed a very great chance of entering the God-Slaying Army, and such a sight had caused great envy within them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Fortunately, he was not discovered.If Gentle Snow found out that Shi Feng was the creator of the Garrison Armor, terrifying consequences might have occurred. Also, Shi Feng did not doubt the possibility of Gentle Snow utilizing a forceful approach.The Snow Goddess was not an empty title. Her iron-fist methods have tongue-tied countless experts. Otherwise, she would not have been able to take care of so many experts.However, Shi Feng discovered an interesting matter from Gentle Snow\u2019s words.The many Guilds in White River City have already started attaching great importance towards the Garrison Armor. This meant the reputation of the Garrison Armor had already spread. Currently, the Garrison Armor\u2019s popularity might have reached its peak. It was a great chance for Shi Feng to sell the Garrison Armor in large quantities, earning a ton of money. After another period had passed, the Garrison Armor\u2019s worth would not be as great as it was now.\u201cLet\u2019s first take a look at the Epic Quest; then I\u2019ll return to making the Garrison Armors.\u201d Shi Feng impatiently wanted to return to making Garrison Armors now that a chance for him to make a lot of money had arrived. However, the Epic Quest currently before him was much more important. If he gave it up part way, he would definitely regret it for the rest of his life.This Epic Quest played a big role in allowing Fantasy Extinguisher a legendary achievement. Naturally, Shi Feng would not let go of this chance meeting.After spending twenty minutes maneuvering along the narrow pathways of the Slum Area, Shi Feng finally arrived at the Library.On his way here, Shi Feng discovered the wonder of having a Divine Official walking by his side in the Slums. The NPCs who intended to rob him all backed away accordingly after seeing Sharlyn\u2019s attire. Otherwise, Shi Feng would have needed to spend over an hour for this trip, continuously battling against these sewer rats. Moreover, these NPCs were literally dirt poor. Shi Feng would not obtain any rewards for killing these NPCs, not even EXP. The Library of Red Leaf Town had a withered appearance. The building only had two floors to it, and there was nobody present to manage it as dead leaves could be seen climbing the walls.Entering the Library, dust and dirt covered the entire building. The books laying on the wooden table had long since been parceled up by a layer of dust. The Library looked more like a haunted house than a place in which people once lived.\u201cApologies. It has been a long time since anybody has visited, so I haven\u2019t been tidying up the place. Just sit wherever you want,\u201d Sharlyn faintly smiled as she pointed towards a dust-covered chair, not understanding that her action was very inappropriate.\u201cRevered Divine Official, I have come here because I wish to have this diary translated,\u201d Shi Feng said, getting straight towards the point. His eyebrows slightly wrinkled when he looked towards the finger-thick layer of dust covering the chair. He truly did not wish to dirty his clothes.However, Sharlyn remained minding her own business as she searched for something on the bookshelf. It was like she did not hear Shi Feng speak at all.Shi Feng was long used to such behaviors, so he chose to remain silent. There were all sorts of NPCs in God\u2019s Domain. It was especially true for important NPCs. Unique and bizarre behaviors were considered small matters. There were well-known NPCs that were much more damnable. These NPCs caused many first-rate Guilds to curse their mothers.After waiting for ten whole minutes, Sharlyn finally came out from the pile of bookshelves. In her hands, she held a thick and tattered old book.\u201cI know why you are here. The moment you\u2019ve set foot in the Slums, I could sense the evil energy coming from your body,\u201d Sharlyn said gravely. She placed the tattered book on the table, causing all the dust in the building to abruptly soar, \u201cLet me have a look at the item.\u201dShi Feng naturally knew the diary triggered such a scenario. He took out the tattered diary from his bag, carefully passing it to Sharlyn.Sharlyn was not in a hurry to receive the diary. Instead, she chanted out a phrase of Divine Words. Suddenly, streaks of golden Divine Words wrapped around the diary.Just when Shi Feng was wondering about Sharlyn\u2019s actions, a change suddenly came over the diary. Black smoke suddenly appeared on its pitch-black cover, and a sinister-looking face came into view. It looked as if it was in extreme pain.\u201cEvil be gone! Divine Spear!\u201dSharlyn shouted, her jade-like hand drawing out Divine Words in midair. At the same time, she started singing out a Tier 3 Divine Curse, her voice echoing throughout the entire Library. A golden colored hexagram appeared above the Library, covering the entire building, and from the magic formation, three golden Spears of Judgement came flying out. The spears pierced the diary, tearing apart the sinister face.\u201cHahaha, I won\u2019t give up! We will meet again!\u201d The sinister face loudly laughed as it spoke the bone-chilling words. Both of its eyes were firmly affixed toward Shi Feng as if the words it spoke were meant for him.Within a moment, the black smoke above the diary dispersed. Meanwhile, Sharlyn\u2019s forehead was covered in sweat. Her complexion was deathly pale, and she currently looked extremely weak.System: You have been cursed by a Great Demon[1]. All Attributes reduced by 50%, experience received from killing monsters reduced by 95%.System: You have been eyed by a Great Demon. The phantom of the Great Demon will come for you in thirty days. If you are killed by the phantom, your body will be taken over by the Great Demon.\u201cCrap! Make it more ruthless, why don\u2019t you?\u201d Regardless of how self-restraint he had been, Shi Feng could not help but curse when he saw this notification. When compared to human standards, a Great Demon was the equivalent of a Tier 4 Job. It was on the same level as a Sword Emperor. Although it was just a phantom, it would still require Sharlyn, who had a Tier 3 Job, to handle it. However, instead of aiming for Sharlyn, the Great Demon actually went for a bystander and a minor character like Shi Feng.With this curse around, how would he be able to level up? Not to mention the 50% reduction in Attributes. It had caused his Attributes to sink down to the level of an average player. It would be a problem if he wanted to kill monsters of a higher level. He also had to face the phantom of the Great Demon\u2026\u201cMiss Sharlyn, are you alright?\u201d although he was cursed, Shi Feng still spoke politely.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSharlyn shook her head slightly, speaking with a smile, \u201cNothing too bad. I never imagined that you would actually bring such a terrifying item. You\u2019ve weakened me quite a bit. However, the problem has been resolved now. If you had dragged on for a few more days, your body might have been possessed by the Great Demon, and your body would suffer in Hell for all eternity.\u201cThank you, Miss Sharlyn. If it weren\u2019t for you, I might have already been dead.\u201d Although Sharlyn\u2019s words felt somewhat wrong, Shi Feng had still thanked her. He rejoiced at the fact that he had come to the Library without delay. Otherwise, he would truly be finished. However, the problem right now had yet to be resolved.\u201cNo need for thanks. This diary is not as simple as it seems. It is a key. In it records the method to unlock the curse on a gate. Your job now is to find this gate, enter through it with this diary, and find the Bible of Darkness that is kept within. I can destroy the Bible of Darkness as long as you retrieve it for me. Once it is destroyed, the Great Demon would not be able to descend,\u201d Sharlyn explained.System: Epic Quest \u201cDarkness Descends\u201d accepted. Find and destroy the Bible of Darkness and prevent the Great Demon from descending. Rewards unknown.Although Shi Feng had known about the extreme difficulty of completing an Epic Quest, there was still no need for it to be so damnable! At the very least, the Quest should tell him where to find the Bible of Darkness!In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, Fantasy Extinguisher had completed this Quest in Black Dragon Empire. However, Shi Feng couldn\u2019t just go to Black Dragon Empire.Even if he went there, the Teleportation Gates had not been activated at this stage of the game, so he would have to run there. However, even if he ran till his legs broke, he would still need to waste several months before he could reach the borders of Black Dragon Empire.TL Notes:[1]Great Demon: this is a rank for Demons (not monsters). This will be further clarified in future chapters when Demons are better introduced.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He did not understand how Fantasy Extinguisher completed this Epic Quest in his previous life.Who the heck would know where the Bible of Darkness was stored?Moreover, in his previous life, the information Shi Feng collected regarding this Quest was very incomplete, so the parts he could use as reference were extremely limited.Currently, the evil curse Shi Feng was shouldering even made leveling a problem. No matter what, he had to think of a solution to this problem. Otherwise, the problems he would face in the future would be even greater.\u201cEsteemed Miss Sharlyn, I am now cursed by the demon. Do you have any methods to resolve it?\u201d Shi Feng calmed his heart. He turned to look at Sharlyn, who was currently in a delicate state, asking, \u201cAlso, where can I find the Bible of Darkness? Even just a clue is helpful.\u201dHearing Shi Feng\u2019s series of questions, a bright smile appeared on Sharlyn\u2019s pure countenance.\u201cYou sure have a lot of questions, huh, you little bastard? It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have a method to resolve your curse. However, you should know, to get something, you have to give something in return. There is only one way to dispel the curse, and that is to carry out a Moon Drip. The Moon Drip is a ceremony that can dispel all magic and curses in the world. However, many materials are required to carry out this ceremony. I will provide the materials required, but in return, you have to pay 3 Gold Coins as remuneration for my services. If you wish to obtain a clue to the Bible of Darkness, you have to pay an additional 10 Gold Coins as an information fee.\u201dShi Feng felt a chill going down his spine as he looked at Sharlyn\u2019s expression, which became more excited the more she explained. It was especially true for Sharlyn\u2019s eyes. Even if she looked incomparably pure right now, her appearance was still not enough to hide the burning desire within her eyes.In the end, one word still dictated everything.Money!System: Do you wish to accept the Quest to dispel the curse?\u201cEsteemed Miss Sharlyn, I am willing to pay the remunerations.\u201d What else could he have said? However, Sharlyn\u2019s asking price of 3 Gold Coins was just too high. There was not a single player in White River City who could afford such an amount right now.\u201cSince you are willing, then pay a deposit of 1 Gold Coin,\u201d Sharlyn stretched out her delicate hand without restraint.Seeing Sharlyn\u2019s actions, Shi Feng suspected that she had some sort of x-ray technique. However, he had to pay the money sooner or later, so Shi Feng reluctantly handed over 1 Gold Coin to Sharlyn.The moment Shi Feng had handed over the money, he went from being a wealthy tycoon to being a poor peasant.\u201cHere, this is for you. You need to fill the energy within this thing first. It will lead you to the Moonlight Forest to collect thirty pieces of Moonstone. It\u2019s fine if you just bring them back to me,\u201d Sharlyn took the shining Gold Coin with lightning speed, then took out a fist-sized crystal orb and passed it to Shi Feng.System: Quest \u201cMoon Drip\u201d accepted. You must collect thirty pieces of Moonstone and 2 Gold Coins for Sharlyn. Upon completion, Sharlyn will dispel the evil curse of the Great Demon on you.Shi Feng received the crystal orb and took a look at it.[Teleportation Magic Orb]Able to teleport the user to and from the Moonlight Forest immediately after activation.Activation condition: 200,000 EXP needed to be stored.Two hundred thousand experience points were enough to let the average player rise from Level 0 to Level 7 within an instant. To Shi Feng right now, such an amount was asking for his life.Currently, the experience he obtained from killing monsters would be reduced by 95%. He would obtain absolutely no experience from killing monsters of the same level. As for Elites, he would just be able to obtain around 10 EXP for killing one that was a Level higher. That meant he would have to kill twenty thousand Elites that were 1 Level higher than hem to collect 200,000 EXP. How long would it take for him to kill that many?! Moreover, there weren\u2019t even that many Elite monsters in Red Leaf Town.\u201cIt really is worthy of being called an Epic Quest? The difficulty is truly insane,\u201d Shi Feng bitterly laughed.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, Fantasy Extinguisher had the support of the first-rate Guild, [Fantasy Shrine]. So, he was able to complete the Quest after much difficulty. However, Shi Feng did not have the support of a first-rate Guild. It would be extremely difficult if he wanted to complete the Quest. However, as long as Shi Feng completed it, the rewards would easily outshine the troubles. The rewards for this Epic Quest resulted in Fantasy Extinguisher\u2019s fame.Although Shi Feng did not have a first-rate Guild supporting him, he was a reincarnated person. He still had quite an advantage over the other players. At the very least, he would not lose out to the first-rate Guilds regarding earning money.\u201cIt looks like I can only return and forge Garrison Armors for now.\u201d Shi Feng kept the crystal orb and left the Library. He planned to first earn enough Gold Coins before thinking of a way to store up 200,000 EXP.The sky outside was already bright by the time Shi Feng returned to the Trade Area. Many players already left to kill monsters and level up, emptying the streets by quite a bit. Shi Feng immediately went to the Bank to retrieve the forging materials and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.Just when Shi Feng was headed to the Forging Association, a notification came from the System.System: The Garrison Heavy Armor you have placed on auction has been sold. After deducting the processing fees, a total of 31 Silvers 53 Coppers have been added to your bag space.\u201cIs it worth that much?\u201d Shi Feng was shocked.The Level 3 Garrison Heavy Armor was just a piece of equipment that had similar Attributes to a Mysterious-Iron Equipment. At most, it was worth 20 Silver Coins. Now, however, it had been sold for over 30 Silver Coins. One could just imagine how frantic these Guilds were towards the Garrison Heavy Armor.Shi Feng\u2019s enthusiasm was further boosted with the arrival of this information. He could not help but wish he could immediately forge a hundred pieces of Garrison Armor, selling them and making a big profit.Hence, Shi Feng activated Windwalk as he rushed towards the Forging Association. Without hesitation, Shi Feng reserved an Intermediate Forging Room for twenty hours. If he did not reap the money of those Guilds right now, he would not be doing justice towards his own reincarnation.Inside the Forging Room, Shi Feng refined all the Stone he collected, going all-out as he forged the Garrison Armors.When the first Garrison Armor was successfully forged\u2026System: Garrison Armor has been successfully forged. Forgery Proficiency increased by 2 points. Obtained 800 EXP.System: Do you wish to store the experience obtained in the Teleportation Magic Orb?Suddenly, Shi Feng halted the work he was doing. He called out the System Interface, taking a careful look.\u201cI obtained 800 EXP from forging?\u201d Shi Feng placed a hand on his chin, pondering. Suddenly, he said with a smile, \u201cHow could I forget about this in a panic? The curse is only aimed at the experience obtained from killing monsters. It has no effect towards experience that is rewarded.\u201dAlthough a lot of time was needed to forge a piece of equipment, it was a different story if the success rate was very high. Shi Feng\u2019s leveling speed at that time would be a lot faster than the average player, even with the 95% experience reduction state he was currently under.With such an opportune method in hand, the difficulty of the Epic Quest had been greatly reduced in an instant.Moreover, Shi Feng had the Book of Forging. It could increase the success rate of forging the Garrison Armor up to 60%. With it, Shi Feng\u2019s leveling speed would greatly surpass even the expert players. It would not be long before he would finish collecting the 200,000 EXP.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn such a way, Shi Feng could earn not just money, but experience as well. It was killing two birds with one stone. It was absolutely great.Fantasy Extinguisher most likely did not imagine there was such a quick method to dispelling the curse.Thinking up to this point, Shi Feng immediately adjusted for the System to distribute 100% of the experience he obtained to be stored in the Teleportation Magic Orb. Then, he picked up an ore and started happily forging equipment.Because of his improved mood, Shi Feng\u2019s hands became much more nimble. The Hundred Refinement Hammer in his hands was like a musical instrument, rhythmically beating out a moving melody.By the time Shi Feng regained his sense of self, he was suddenly dumbfounded by the Garrison Armor before him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was absolutely not the Garrison Armor.\u201cCrap,\u201d Shi Feng understood he had failed.Before, he was too absorbed into his own excitement while he was forging the equipment. He smashed the hammer in whichever way he wanted, giving the Garrison Armor a completely different appearance. He even felt good about it.Still, the appearance of this new Plate Armor looked extremely cool. It would definitely look majestic while worn.Following which, Shi Feng chose to identify the equipment\u2019s information.The System took a whole 10 seconds before giving a conclusion this time.[Unnamed] (Bronze-rank Plate Armor)Level 3Equipment Requirement: Strength 12Defense +23Strength +3, Endurance +3HP +120Durability 35/35Additional Ability-Healing Power: Healing effects received are increased by 10%.Restricted to Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights.System: Unnamed equipment has been successfully forged. Forging Proficiency increased by 3 points. Obtained 1,100 EXP.System: Congratulations! You are the first player to forge an entirely new piece of Bronze Equipment in God\u2019s Domain. Obtained 3,000 EXP. Rewarding 1 Runic Hammer (Mysterious-Iron rank) that increases forging success rate by 5%.System: Please give a name to the equipment you have created. You are also able to leave a personal mark on this piece of equipment.Shi Feng was slightly shocked when he saw these notifications. He had unintentionally remodeled the Garrison Armor, and successfully at that. He even created an entirely new piece of Bronze Equipment. His luck was truly good. The Attributes of this equipment had already reached the level of an average Mysterious-Iron Equipment. If only the materials used were not so poor, it would definitely have become a Mysterious-Iron Equipment.In God\u2019s Domain, players were able to create equipment. However, this was an extremely difficult task to accomplish. Not only did the player have to be extremely familiar with forging, but they also had to have a thorough understanding of the various materials available. After undergoing hundreds of trials, only then could completely new, and good quality, equipment be created.Usually, players who wanted to create new equipment would only start to do so after they had risen to become an Advanced Forger. After all, to become a Master Forger, not only did a player require sufficient Proficiency, they also needed to create three entirely new pieces of Mysterious-Iron Equipment, and also one entirely new piece of Secret-Silver Equipment. Only after all those conditions were achieved could a player become a Master Forger.Due to this condition, the players who became Master Forgers were extremely rare.Meanwhile, Shi Feng unintentionally created an entirely new piece of Bronze Equipment. Of course, the Book of Forging\u2019s effect played a large part in contributing to this success.\u201cSince the color has become a pale gold, and it\u2019s giving off a dull glow, let\u2019s call it the Glimmer Chestpiece.\u201d Shi Feng immediately confirmed the equipment\u2019s new name. After which, he left an imprint of a black flame at a corner of the equipment. This imprint was the equivalent of a forger\u2019s name. In the future, when others see this symbol, they would know that this equipment was created by Master so-and-so. At the same time, the symbol also served to prevent others from falsifying the equipment\u2019s original creator.In the blink of an eye, the equipment\u2019s information also had a change to it.[Glimmer Chestpiece] (Bronze-rank Plate Armor)Level 3Equipment Requirement: Strength 12Defense +23Strength +3, Endurance +3HP +120Durability 35/35Additional Ability-Healing Power: Healing effects received are increased by 10%.Restricted to Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights.On the right breast of the Glimmer Chestpiece, the mark of a black flame appeared. The flame constantly faded in and out of existence, further enriching the aesthetics of the Glimmer Chestpiece.System: \u201cBlack Flame\u201d Imprint has been successfully registered. This Imprint has been bound to your gaming account, and nobody else is able to use it.System: Naming successful. Forging Design for the Glimmer Chestpiece has been automatically generated. Player can now voluntarily draw the Forging Design for the Glimmer Chestpiece, allowing others to learn the Forging Design.Suddenly, an additional window appeared in Shi Feng\u2019s Lifestyle Panel. It was called Forging Design Creation, and it allowed players to create their own Forging Designs.Shi Feng felt endless ecstasy when he saw this new window.This was the benefit of creating something original. As long as Shi Feng had a Pen and Drawing Paper, he could fabricate as many Forging Designs for the Glimmer Chestplate as he wanted. This was the treatment that was only available for original creations. Forging Designs were much more valuable than the equipment itself.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, countless Master Forgers constantly researched various materials and used all sorts of methods to develop new equipment. Other than trying to become a Grandmaster Forger, their main goal was to obtain an Original Forging Design. This item was the reason why some Master Forgers were extremely rich. The process of fabricating a Forging Design was very simple, and they could easily make tens to hundreds of them any time they wanted. Otherwise, how much money could they make, even if they exhaust themselves by forging equipment every single day?With the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design, earning 10 Gold Coins was a small matter. At that time, it was even possible for Shi Feng to earn up to 30 or 40 Gold Coins. After all, there were a lot of players in White River City and no shortage of Guilds, either.Afterward, Shi Feng continued forging Glimmer Chestplates, no longer forging Garrison Armors. Both of them required the same materials to make; however, the Glimmer Chestplate had a cooler-looking appearance and even came with an Additional Ability.There was another benefit for an original creation. When forging your own creation, the success rate for it was increased by 10%, and the equipment would also have a higher chance to come with an Additional Ability. As long as the Glimmer Chestplate\u2019s fame spread, Shi Feng would have no troubles selling its Forging Design.Time passed, bit by bit.Shi Feng was completely unaware of his surroundings as he forged equipment. His heart was filled with the thoughts of money. One Gold Coin\u2026 Two Gold Coins\u2026 Three Gold Coins\u2026Piece after piece of shining golden equipment piled up in the entire Forging Room.When ten hours had passed since Shi Feng rented the Forging Room, a loud notification had come from the System. Only then had Shi Feng suddenly realized ten hours had already gone by.His gains were even more shocking, however. He successfully made a total of 142 pieces of equipment, and the materials he had bought were nearly depleted.Amongst the Attributes of the equipment, there were some that were good, and some that were bad. The difference between them was the healing effects. The bad ones had 5%, while the good ones had 12%. There were a total of 76 pieces that had their healing effects below 7%, 48 pieces that had their healing effects between 7% and 9%, and 18 pieces that were between 10% and 12%. These pieces of equipment filled up over half of Shi Feng\u2019s bag space.At the same time, Shi Feng\u2019s Proficiency also had a big increase, reaching up to 514 points. Shi Feng was now halfway to becoming an Intermediate Forging Apprentice.Shi Feng took out the Teleportation Orb to have a look. The experience it had currently stored up was close to 150,000. As long as Shi Feng continued putting in an effort for several more hours, he would be able to store up the 200,000 and immediately go to the Moonlight Forest.The speed at which Shi Feng gained EXP was at least two to three times faster than the Guild Leaders of first-rate Guilds.After leaving the Forging Association, Shi Feng ran to the Auction House.Currently, a majority of the average players should have already risen to Level 3, whereas many veteran players should have risen to Level 4. Only expert players would be closing into Level 5. After all, a lot of experience was required to rise from Level 4 to Level 5. The amount needed was at least three to four times the amount needed to rise from Level 3 to Level 4.Right now was the perfect time for Shi Feng to sell the Level 3 Bronze Equipment. The various Guilds should also have amassed quite an amount of wealth after more than ten hours had passed, so it was a good chance for Shi Feng to make a big catch. If another period of time were to pass, the prices of equipment would most likely be greatly reduced.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter arriving at the Auction House, Shi Feng noticed that the number of logistic players present significantly had reduced. It seemed as if they were no longer as enthusiastic towards the Garrison Armor as before.\u201cFellow brother, why are there suddenly so few people at the Auction House?\u201d Shi Feng walked up behind a logistic player, asking.The tall and bespectacled logistic player was slightly surprised, explaining, \u201cHave you been killing monsters outside town all this time? You don\u2019t even know about such a huge matter?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve just returned after making some money from killing monsters and selling materials. Wasn\u2019t that Garrison Armor super popular? I, too, wanted to buy a piece,\u201d Shi Feng nodded.\u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t know about it. Three hours ago, a player called Hammer Trading had sold a lot of Level 3 Bronze Plate Armor Equipment. Although the Attributes on it were slightly weaker than the Garrison Armor, its price was extremely low, costing only 4 Silver Coins. Moreover, that player even announced that there would be discounts if you contacted him and ordered in bulk. Naturally, the various Guilds all contacted him and ordered. That equipment is now extremely popular, so who would remain here and pay attention to the Garrison Armor?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57 \u2013 Hammer Trading\u201cHammer Trading?\u201d Shi Feng wanted to confirm once more.\u201cCorrect. He even posted a thread on the forums criticizing the blackhearted forger that made the Garrison Armor. Currently, the thread has already received more than seven million clicks. With it, that guy has quickly become a famous person in White River City. I heard many large Guilds have already sent out an olive branch to him, trying to recruit him with a high price.\u201d The logistics player had a face filled with envy while he spoke. He couldn\u2019t help but wish he could turn into Hammer Trading. That way, he would be able to live a life filled with beauties and riches.Shi Feng only smiled at the player as he turned to walk towards an empty seat. He sat down and called out the game\u2019s official forum.He wanted to have a good look at this Hammer Trading who nearly robbed him of his business.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, Hammer Trading did not reveal himself as quickly as this. Before Shadow scouted him, he had been playing God\u2019s Domain with tens of fellow schoolmates. With the support of these schoolmates, in addition to some chance meetings that had allowed him to become an Intermediate Forging Apprentice, he managed to become acquainted with the upper echelons of Shadow. At that time, there were very few Intermediate Forging Apprentices. The Bronze Equipment that was forged at the time was also very popular. Seeing such a situation, Shadow also wanted a share of the profits. So, they paid a large price to hire Hammer Trading. Along with the continuous support of Shadow Workshop, Hammer Trading grew to become a shocking figure, becoming a relatively famous Forger and earning Shadow a lot of money.Afterward, Hammer Trading also obtained the Forging Talent[1] in addition to the great support from Shadow, allowing him to become a Master Forger. During those times, he did not have the slightest hint of respect for Shi Feng, who was the Guild Leader of Shadow at that time.In the end, with the strong support of Hammer Trading, along with several Master Forgers and Master Potionmakers, Lan Hua Financial Groups gladly agreed to World Dominator\u2019s acquisition of Shadow. Otherwise, Lan Hua Financial Groups would not have agreed to the decision without hesitation and dismissing Shi Feng at the same time.Shi Feng opened the forums for Star-Moon Kingdom, his heart lamenting over how fate was toying with him.In this life, just when the Garrison Armor was beginning to sell like hotcakes, Hammer Trading appeared to break off his road to wealth.Shi Feng couldn\u2019t help but admit that he and Hammer Trading were rivals in life.Shi Feng stole the Forging Talent from Hammer Trading, whereas Hammer Trading turned around to break off his road to wealth.Browsing the forums of Star-Moon Kingdom, Shi Feng quickly discovered a thread marked in red, positioned at the top of the forum.Upholding justice starts from us! We absolutely cannot let this blackhearted forger do as he pleases! I am a forger with a kind heart!These large, bright red words caused Shi Feng\u2019s brows to furrow.What kind of trouble is he trying to cause here?The number of clicks exceeded ten million!Out of curiosity, Shi Feng had opened the thread.Shi Feng looked at the eloquently written condemnation that had over ten thousand words. The article had justifiably mentioned that the cost of making a piece of Bronze Equipment did not even exceed 1 Silver Coin. However, the blackhearted Shi Feng sold his equipment for up to 30 Silver Coins. He was ripping off other players. Hence, Hammer Trading wanted to oppose Shi Feng. He was even willing to sell Level 3 Bronze Equipment without limit. Only, due to the failure rates, he had no choice but to sell them at 4 Silvers a piece to reclaim his cost of making.This article received the support of a lot of players. They had all declared that they would no longer purchase the Garrison Armor and that they would support Hammer Trading\u2019s actions of kindness.Shi Feng was speechless after reading the entire article.The entire article was just trying to put a smear on his reputation while heightening Hammer Trading\u2019s own self. At the same time, Hammer Trading wanted to state that he, too, could forge Bronze Equipment.He was clearly trying to use Shi Feng as a stepping stone to raise his own worth and fame. He wanted to let the many large Guilds extend an olive branch to him, and in turn, raising his own worth.However, Shi Feng had to admit that Hammer Trading had succeeded. Not only had his fame risen in a burst, but many second-rate Guilds had also sent him an invitation. There were even a few first-rate Guilds who were willing to discuss matters of cooperation with Hammer Trading.\u201cCrap, not only has he broken off my path to wealth, he still wants to use me as a stepping stone?!\u201d Shi Feng could no longer hold back his two lifetime\u2019s worth of rage. He wanted to properly teach Hammer Trading a lesson.Did he think he was awesome for selling Level 3 Bronze Equipment without limit?Shi Feng did not wish to have any relation with Hammer Trading if he did not try to use Shi Feng as a stepping stone. However, now that he had provoked Shi Feng, he must be ready to pay the appropriate price.Shi Feng felt it was just hilarious when he looked at the statements and numbers provided by Hammer Trading.Basic Forging Apprentices only had a 5% success rate when forging a piece of Level 3 Bronze Equipment. However, looking at the numbers provided by Hammer Trading, it could be seen that he did not possess just a Forging Design for a piece of Bronze Equipment. He must have also obtained an item that increased the success rate for forging. In addition to using the Intermediate Forging Room, his success rate should be around 20%. That was why he dared to spout nonsense and brought out several pieces of equipment for auction to prove his words.However, according to Shi Feng\u2019s estimates, to raise his reputation, Hammer Trading was taking a loss of 1 Silver Coin for every piece of Bronze Equipment he sold. Although Shi Feng did not know how much funding Hammer Trading had, he was still ten years too early from competing with Shi Feng.Selling at 4 Silver Coins, is it?Shi Feng would sell his equipment at 4 Silver Coins as well. He had the Philosopher\u2019s Stone and the Book of Forging, so his initial cost was just slightly more than 10 Coppers. Including his terrifying success rate, Shi Feng was looking forward to seeing who had the last laugh.Without holding anything back, Shi Feng immediately posted a thread on the forum anonymously. The article was titled \u201cShockingly high-quality Plate Armor on Auction House.\u201d Afterward, he called up the interface for the Auction House, placing twenty pieces of the worst Glimmer Chestplate on auction.The Healing Power on the Glimmer Chestplate had a remarkable effect on MTs when inside a Dungeon. It was even better when compared to the Garrison Armor. When compared to Hammer Trading\u2019s Savage Chestplate, it was more than two times better. Players would naturally know which equipment to choose when they saw the Glimmer Chestplate.\u201cHammer Trading, didn\u2019t you want to be famous? I\u2019ll let you become super famous. I\u2019ll turn you into a celebrity.\u201d Shi Feng revealed a cold grin as he closed the interface. He turned around and left the Auction House, setting up a stall outside to purchase Stones and Hard Stones.Two minutes after Shi Feng had posted his thread\u2026A few players noticed Shi Feng\u2019s post. Average players were still very attentive towards high-quality equipment. Currently, the average player did not even possess a piece of Bronze Equipment, not to mention high-quality equipment. So, naturally, they wanted to get a glimpse.The moment these players arrived at the Auction House, they were stupefied by what they saw.The Attributes on the Glimmer Chestplate was just too good, especially the Healing Power. It was definitely the most beloved Ability for an MT when inside a Dungeon.After they finished looking at the Attributes, the players chose to try wearing it.They looked at their own appearance when wearing the Glimmer Chestplate. Streamline mold, dashing figure, and even a faint radiance coming off their bodies. There was also a flickering black flame on their left breast. They looked absolutely awesome! It was as if they had become the heroes from legends while wearing the Glimmer Chestplate, valiant and powerful.Then, they looked at the selling price. It actually only required 4 Silver Coins.These players did not dare believe their eyes. Such high-end equipment was only selling for 4 Silver Coins. If they did not buy it, they would be doing a disservice to their own lives. Even if they did not have much money on their persons, they were willing to sacrifice everything they had to buy the Glimmer Chestplate.Within a short fifteen minutes, Shi Feng\u2019s post had become the topic of the forum. There were even players who posted the information and appearance of the Glimmer Chestplate, the equipment instantly arousing everyone\u2019s exclamation. Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights could not help but wish they could obtain this high-end equipment right that instant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, when they wanted to go to the Auction House and buy it, there were only four pieces of the equipment remaining. Moreover, every one of those pieces had their prices bade up to more than 6 Silver Coins\u2026One MT from an Elite party had reluctantly chosen to borrow money from all over the place. In the end, he successfully won a piece for 7 Silver Coins. When the Glimmer Chestplate arrived in his hands, he no longer minded the money he owed for it. With such Attributes and dashing appearance, he would not have any troubles earning money in the future.Thinking up to this point, the smile on this Shield Warrior spread widely.TL Notes:[1] Forging Talent: this is referring to the Forging Genius mentioned in Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58 \u2013 Equipment CompetitionJust a short twenty minutes after Shi Feng placed the Glimmer Chestplates on auction, all twenty pieces of them had been sold off. The Glimmer Chestplate\u2019s popularity was far better than the Garrison Armor.There were even quite a few players showing off their purchases on the official forum.Previously, these players had to beg, using various methods, to join a party. Now, however, with their majestic-looking equipment, a simple shout would garner them tens of invites from Elite parties for their own choosing.Following the Glimmer Chestplate\u2019s rise in popularity, the players that failed to buy one were all beating their own chest in anguish. They hated themselves for not borrowing money to buy the piece of equipment since, right now, it was no longer being sold.Meanwhile, the Forging Association in Golden Sand Town was packed with people.The spacious hall was entirely occupied by players. The players present were the spokespeople for various Guilds. They were here for only one purpose, and that was to invite Hammer Trading to their Guild.Amongst the Guilds present, there were quite a few that were very famous. There was no lack of spokespeople for third-rate Guilds. If it were during ordinary times, these spokespeople would act proud and arrogant. They would use a condescending attitude when dealing with Lifestyle players. Even so, these Lifestyle players would still treat them with great respect. They would even shed tears of emotion, pledging their loyalty to the Guild as they quickly signed the contract, becoming a part of a large Guild.However, the current trend of the game had changed. The higher-ups of the Guilds strongly emphasized that they, the spokespeople, must definitely invite Hammer Trading. Otherwise, they could start packing up their bags. Hence why these Guild spokespeople were like obedient grandchildren, standing and waiting in the hall for Hammer Trading\u2019s summons.Inside an Intermediate Forging Room on the second floor\u2026\u201cBrother Hammer, you\u2019re so awesome! I admire you so much! Before, those third-rate Guilds would not recruit you no matter what. Now, they\u2019re just like grandchildren waiting upon you. They would not leave even if you chased them away,\u201d A sexy female cleric in her mid-twenties hugged around Hammer Trading\u2019s robust arm, giggling and speaking with admiration. Her bulging chest was rubbing against his arm.Hammer Trading had a very brutish appearance. He had a thick beard and beady eyes, and his skin color was similar to yellowish wax. Judging from his appearance, he looked to be over thirty years of age. Nobody was able to tell, however, that Hammer Trading was just a university student in reality. His age was just slightly over twenty.\u201cHahaha, this is just a small matter. However, I truly have to thank the fool who opened the road for me and has even hidden his name. He made all the large Guilds know of my importance,\u201d Hammer Trading heartily laughed. He silently praised his own intelligence and wisdom for being able to think up of a plan to utilize that anonymous forger\u2019s fame. It allowed him his current good fortune, becoming every player\u2019s idol, \u201cWait till I\u2019ve entered a first-rate Guild and rise into their upper-echelons. It will be truly awesome. Right now, I\u2019m just showing a small part of my prowess. Let those third-rate Guilds continue waiting outside. I can use them to raise my own value and fame.\u201d\u201cBoss, what are we going to do about all the orders we\u2019ve received?\u201d an Assassin asked.Hammer Trading rolled his eyes at the Assassin, saying in disdain, \u201cWho cares about them? I\u2019m taking a loss of 2 Silver Coins per piece of equipment. Do they think I\u2019m running a charity? My goal has already been met. I\u2019m only waiting for the first-rate Guilds to come. Don\u2019t bother with the other players; just tell them that we\u2019re too busy and don\u2019t have time.\u201dTo use Shi Feng as a stepping stone, Hammer Trading used up all the Silver Coins belonging to his classmates. He also spent a lot of Credits to purchase a lot of materials and Silver Coins. Yet, he only forged over ten Savage Chestplates from all those materials. So, selling each piece at a maximum of 4 Silver Coins caused a major loss for him. However, all his sacrifices were worth it. As long as he was recruited by a first-rate Guild, he could get as many materials as he wanted, a huge salary, and even a line of female players desiring his attention. Hammer Trading felt invigorated just from thinking of all these benefits.Suddenly, a Berserker entered the Forging Room with a panicked expression.\u201cWhat happened, Hadron? Seeing as you\u2019re in such a hurry, has the upper echelon of a first-rate Guild arrived?\u201d Hammer Trading teasingly asked.\u201cBig trouble! A lot of top-tier equipment has suddenly appeared at the Auction House. All the players on the game\u2019s official forum are discussing it now, and the number of clicks on the post is madly increasing. The post has over five million clicks right now, and many Guilds have started to notice it. Moreover, the equipment is being sold by the same anonymous forger. The equipment\u2019s price is set at a minimum of 4 Silver Coins. Everyone is starting to wonder about the identity of the forger responsible, and they are no longer paying any attention to you, Boss.\u201d\u201cMoreover, there are already a few first-rate Guilds who made a declaration on the forum. They are willing to hire that forger with a high salary and make him the Chief Forger of their Guild. A few representatives of large Guilds downstairs have also started leaving for the Auction House.\u201dHammer Trading\u2019s expression froze when hearing Hadron\u2019s words.He only managed to attract the attention of first-rate Guilds after much difficulty. However, now, that anonymous forger stole his wind. If he did not steal it back, those first-rate Guilds would most likely forget about him.\u201cHe has such nerve to steal my wind and position. Don\u2019t blame me for not being polite. Making that kind of top-tier equipment has a high cost and low success rate. If you sell it at 4 Silver Coins, then I\u2019ll sell at 3 Silver Coins. I wonder just how much you can afford to lose?\u201d Hammer Trading abruptly stood up. He wanted to let Shi Feng know he would definitely not let the position of Chief Forger, and his future \u2018happiness\u2019, go.He was already taking a loss of 2 Silver Coins for making the Savage Chestplate that had inferior Attributes. Then, Shi Feng would at least lose 4 to 5 Silver Coins for selling each piece of top-tier equipment at 4 Silver Coins. Maybe even more. Hammer Trading believed he could outlast Shi Feng.\u201cBut, Boss, we don\u2019t have many Silver Coins remaining. At most, we can afford to forge ten more Savage Chestplates,\u201d Hedron worryingly said.\u201cWhat is there to be afraid of? I still have some funds. Worst comes to worst, I\u2019ll spend some more Credits to buy materials and Silver Coins. I believe I can get rid of that little bastard. For every piece of equipment that little bastard sells, he\u2019s taking a loss of at least double or triple of ours. Why should we be afraid?\u201d Hammer Trading confidently asked. He assured himself that Shi Feng, too, was trying to attract the attention of first-rate Guilds by doing such lossful business. However, he would definitely be the final champion.An hour later, a few additional Savage Chestplates appeared on White River City\u2019s Auction House. Their minimum selling price was 3 Silver Coins each.At the same time, a new post appeared on the game\u2019s official forum.For the benefit of the masses, I, Hammer Trading, have decided to sell the Savage Chestplate at 3 Silver Coins each. I will make a stand against this blackhearted forger to the end! Requesting support! Requesting encouragement!Suddenly, a wave of players followed the post, sending it to the top of the forum. Every one of them supported Hammer Trading\u2019s kind actions.As a result of this incident, all of White River City became lively. Everyone understood this was a competition between two forgers that were capable of forging Bronze Equipment. Every player in White River City watched on with anticipation. The ones who would profit from this exchange, in the end, would definitely be them, the players. It would not be long before they would be able to purchase Bronze Equipment at a low price.The various Guilds also started watching by the sidelines, no longer expressing any of their intentions. They were all waiting for the final victor, while at the same time buying all of the equipment and developing their Guild\u2019s strength.However, Shi Feng himself did not know of this matter. He just finished purchasing Stones and Hard Stones. Just after entering the Auction House, he discovered that the number of players there had once more increased. Only then did he find out about this incident.\u201cYou wish for a fight?\u201d Shi Feng faintly smiled, \u201cThen, come.\u201dHe called out the Auction House\u2019s control interface, placing all of his Glimmer Chestplates on auction. He assigned twenty pieces to be sold every hour, selling a total of 120 pieces of Glimmer Chestplates. Such a number was definitely enough to torment Hammer Trading.Afterward, Shi Feng used the money earned from selling Glimmer Chestplates to buy Hard Stones and Card Sets. After purchasing all these items, Shi Feng suddenly discovered that he still possessed a little more than 1 Gold Coin.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFrom time to time, Shi Feng would receive a notification from the System. It would state that another Glimmer Chestplate had been sold, and some amount of Silver Coins have been deposited into his bag.Shi Feng felt, the more Silver Coins he spent, the more Silver Coins he had. The amount he did not seem to be decreasing in the slightest\u2026Shi Feng considered selling some of his Silver Coins at the Trade Center[1], exchanging it for some spending money in real life. It was much better than just holding on to these Silver Coins.TL Notes:[1] Trade Center: this is not the Trade Area in the game. It\u2019s something like an online market for game currency and items, where you can sell/buy Coins/items for real life money (Credits).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Silver Coins in his hands were no different than Copper as they disappeared in a flash. Hammer Trading also had to spend Credits to purchase more Silver Coins, giving him an immense heartache. However, when he thought of Shi Feng spending much more than him, his heart soothed by a lot. He wanted Shi Feng to go bankrupt.Meanwhile, Shi Feng left the lively Auction House.He arrived at the Bank, storing all the Card Sets and Hard Stones he had collected into his warehouse. Shi Feng was extremely excited as he looked at over a thousand slots of his warehouse filled.This was the benefit of being reincarnated. In his previous life, he in a miserable state thanks to these items. Now, however, they became one of his biggest sources of income.In the eyes of others, these items were still worthless. However, they would be priceless in the future. Their values could increase by over ten-folds, even tens of folds. It was especially true for Card Sets. A complete set would be worth tens of times more than a single piece. Even so, the large Guilds would still have a hard time obtaining them.After he was finished storing the items, Shi Feng made a trip to the Grocery Store. He bought five stacks of White Paper and one stack of pen and ink. These two items could be bought at extremely low prices at the Grocery Store. A stack of 200 White Papers only sold for 10 Copper Coins, whereas as a stack of 20 bottles of Black Ink sold for 15 Copper Coins. The best Feathered Pen also only sold for 20 Copper.Even so, Shi Feng\u2019s casual purchase far exceeded the daily income of an average player.An average player would definitely be unable to spend in such a way. However, to Shi Feng, these Copper Coins could no longer be considered money. Moreover, these items were all necessary for making Forging Designs. Shi Feng would still buy them, even if they cost 10 Silver Coins.After buying the items, Shi Feng headed for the Forging Association.\u201cSir, do you need any cooling beverages? I have here the best Fruit Juice in Red Leaf Town. It tastes extremely good, and it is only 1 Copper Coin per cup.\u201d A fragile-looking young lady nervously asked a male Guardian Knight. The girl was holding onto a small basket, her doll-like eyes carrying with them earnest expectations as she looked at the man.\u201cScram! Don\u2019t annoy me! It\u2019s just a virtual item, moreover a beverage, yet you are actually charging 1 Copper Coin for it? I wouldn\u2019t want it even if you were giving it for free!\u201d The Guardian Knight cursed in rage, pushing the 16 or 17 years old girl away. He then added, \u201cMy luck is just bad. Just you wait and see; I\u2019ll take care of you if I don\u2019t get to buy a Glimmer Chestplate because you delayed me.\u201dThe girl that was pushed down but did not cry. Instead, she stood up without wavering. She clapped the dust off her clothes, proceeding to another player with a smile on her face.Shi Feng was faintly shocked. He never imagined the girl to be so tough. The average female player usually would not carry out such laborious tasks, not to mention receiving the insults from other players.When Shi Feng looked at this girl, he was reminded of his own past self.Shi Feng used Observing Eyes on the girl.Violet Cloud, Level 1 Cleric.Shi Feng\u2019s heart slightly tightened when he saw this name. This girl was actually Violet Cloud, one of the top ten Clerics in God\u2019s Domain. If he could recruit her to his side, his team would have a considerable future.\u201cHahaha! This is a virtual game, yet you\u2019re actually trying to earn money by selling cold beverages? Do you think you\u2019re Milk Tea Sister[1]? Only idiots would buy them. Seeing that you\u2019re good-looking, why don\u2019t you come over to my place tonight? I can even give you 1 Silver Coin.\u201d A lecherous man in his thirties walked up to Violet Cloud, drooling as he harassed her.\u201cSir, I am only selling cold beverages. Please have some self-respect.\u201d Violet Cloud retreated a step, resolutely saying.\u201cI\u2019ve given you praise, yet you\u2019re still headstrong. You\u2019re but a lowly Lifestyle player. If you don\u2019t agree with me today, then you can forget about doing business here in the future.\u201d The lecherous man threatened in rage. He blocked Violet Cloud\u2019s path, staring at her snow-white neck and licking his lips.\u201cHow could you act in such a way? You are simply shameless!\u201d Violet Cloud\u2019s eyes were filled with anger. However, she could not win against him in a fight. If she were to continue wasting time here, even her final hope would be gone.\u201cHehe, I am shameless. What are you going to do about it? Bite me?\u201d The man felt even better when he looked at Violet Cloud\u2019s panicked expression.Watching Violet Cloud trying to hold back from crying and the tears that were rolling about in her eyes, she became even more lovable.\u201cUncle, please give way. I want a thousand cups of Fruit Juice.\u201d Shi Feng used Observing Eyes on the lecherous man. His name was displayed as Drifting Blood, and he was currently Level 3. At this stage of the game, his level was considered relatively good.Drifting Blood turned towards Shi Feng, sending him a glare, saying, \u201cBrat, this girl is mine. If you don\u2019t wish for something to happen to you, then scram. You want a thousand cups? Then I want ten thousand cups. Do you think you\u2019re a tycoon capable of simply taking out 10 Silver Coins? If you continue competing with me like a fool, I\u2019ll send you back to Level 0.\u201dIf fighting were not prohibited within the Town, he would have long since gotten rid of Shi Feng.\u201cHahaha! An amusing show this early in the day. Go for it! Don\u2019t hold back! Don\u2019t argue if you can fight!\u201d\u201cWhat a tycoon, spending 10 Silver Coins just like that. Unfortunately for him, he\u2019s angered Fatty Bear of [Martial Union]. There\u2019s going to be an amusing show to watch.\u201d\u201cDog\u2019s fart tycoon; I bet he\u2019s just boasting to impress the girl. If he can really bring out 10 Silver Coins, I\u2019ll live-stream myself eating shit.\u201dQuite a few busybodies stopped to watch the occurring scene. They all started a discussion about Shi Feng\u2019s actions.Shi Feng did not pay any attention to Drifting Blood at all. He grabbed Drifting Blood\u2019s shoulder, applying a slight force.Before Drifting Blood could react, he was already kneeling on the ground. No matter how much strength he used, even to the point where his face had turned beet-red, he still could not stand back up.The surrounding onlookers were immediately dumbfounded.Shi Feng was just too courageous, directly taking action within the premises of Red Leaf Town. Was he not afraid of being caught and jailed by the Guards?Also, how did Shi Feng possess such immense strength? He had actually suppressed a Level 3 Guardian Knight with a single hand.\u201cBrat, you\u2019re dead for sure. Just you wait till the Guards arrive,\u201d Drifting Blood looked towards Shi Feng, smiling in disdain.However, after waiting for some time, the Guards had still not shown up\u2026Shi Feng paid no attention to Drifting Blood as he firmly pressed him onto the ground, preventing him from even moving. Shi Feng looked towards Violet Cloud, his other hand holding out 10 Silver Coins, saying, \u201cA thousand Fruit Juices, thank you.\u201dThe players on the street, who were previously discussing amongst themselves, suddenly turned silent, their eyes nearly popping out of their sockets.This was 10 Silver Coins, not 10 Copper Coins. Currently, they had felt extremely wealthy to even have a single Silver Coin on their person. On the other hand, Shi Feng had just simply taken out 10 Silver Coins. How rich was Shi Feng? Was he really a Brother Tycoon?Violet Cloud rubbed her eyes. She looked at the 10 Coins in Shi Feng\u2019s hand that gave off a silvery glow, her expression filled with incomparable shock. Originally, she thought Shi Feng was just trying to help her by saying so. Never would she have imagined that he would truly take out 10 Silver Coins to buy a thousand cups of cold beverages that nobody wanted.Drifting Blood was similarly shocked. However, that shock quickly turned into greed. He thought about snatching the 10 Silver Coins and using them to buy a Glimmer Chestplate. There would even be leftovers remaining.\u201cBrat, I\u2019m a member of Martial Union. If you don\u2019t want to be killed back to Level 0, then immediately give me 20 Silvers. If you do so, I can consider letting you off this time. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to take responsibility for the consequences,\u201d Drifting Blood\u2019s gaze was affixed to the 10 Silver coins as he threatened in a chilling tone.Paying no attention to Drifting Blood, Shi Feng looked at Violet Cloud. Seeing that the girl did not react, he asked, \u201cDo you not have that much Fruit Juice?\u201d\u201cEn. I only have 156 cups of Fruit Juice with me. How about you give me a Silver Coin, and I\u2019ll sell all of the Fruit Juice to you? Is that alright?\u201d Violet Cloud worried that she would anger Shi Feng. What would she do if he suddenly decided not to buy? At the same time, she also wanted to thank Shi Feng for helping her, so she reduced her selling price.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright. I wonder how long it would take for you to make 900 cups of Fruit Juice? I want all of them,\u201d Shi Feng nodded after some thought, asking.The surrounding players were all dumbfounded. What was he planning to do? Did this brat know the value of 10 Silver Coins? Did this brat truly fancy this young lady?\u201cI\u2019m very slow at compounding Fruit Juice. If Sir is willing, I can be done in thirty hours.\u201d Violet Cloud became extremely glad at Shi Feng\u2019s words. However, when she thought of her extremely slow speed, she worried that Shi Feng would no longer wish to buy them. So, she stretched out five fingers, hurriedly saying, \u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll just charge you 5 Silver Coins for 900 cups.\u201dTL Notes:[1] Milk Tea Sister: this is a reference to Zhang Zetian, a.k.a. Milk Tea Sister\u5976\u8336\u59b9, China\u2019s youngest female billionaire. Google it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I can still afford to pay such an amount of money. If you really sold them to me for 5 Silvers only, then you wouldn\u2019t be able to earn much.\u201d Shi Feng waved his hand. Shi Feng was not in a hurry to turn Violet Cloud into one of his subordinates. However, he was absolutely not going to let her go. If Shi Feng acted too impatiently, he might cause her to grow suspicious of him. So, it was better to deepen their relationship first.Nobody could have imagined that Violet Cloud, one of the top ten Clerics in God\u2019s Domain, would have such an appearance.A Cleric God!That was a genuine Tier 6 Job. After ten years passed, there were only a few who reached that standard. Even Fantasy Extinguisher was just a Spirit Saint, at the pinnacle of Tier 5 ten years later.However, as a future Cleric God, Violet Cloud was actually a Lifestyle player during the initial periods of the game. It was such a waste of talent.Normally in God\u2019s Domain, only players without any skills would earn money through methods other than killing monsters. However, the popular Auxiliary Jobs usually had very high requirements, such as a lot of funds, coupled with extremely low success rates. It was extremely hard for a player to survive in such a way without the support of a Guild.Meanwhile, Auxiliary Jobs such as Chef was much easier. The cost to support it was also extremely low and players alone could be supported by it by themselves. If their talents were high, and they were capable of creating delicious cuisines, they could still earn quite a lot of money in God\u2019s Domain. However, delicious cuisines usually required Advanced Cooking Recipes and materials. These items were hard to obtain, so trying to earn a lot of money would not be easy.It was truly hard to imagine that a future Cleric God would be such a clumsy young lady.He recalled that Violet Cloud was one of the members of Ouroboros during her first three years in God\u2019s Domain. When the Snow Goddess left Ouroboros, Violet Cloud similarly left the Guild. From then on, she was just a solo player. When she had become a Tier 4 Great Cleric, countless first-rate Guilds tried recruiting her with shockingly high prices. Ouroboros also tried countless times to invite her back. Unfortunately, Violet Cloud did not pay attention to any of them.Her actions greatly angered those first-rate Guilds. Since they could not obtain her, they would destroy her. Hence, they sent many experts to assassinate Violet Cloud.Unfortunately, not only did Violet Cloud not get destroyed, instead, she became even stronger. She massacred the players sent by these Guilds, giving them a crushing defeat. Not long after, she advanced her Job to Tier 5, becoming a Brilliant Cleric Saint. This caused those first-rate Guilds to become even more helpless.In the end, Violet Cloud became a Tier 6 Cleric God. At that time, she searched for all those first-rate Guilds to have her revenge. These Guilds could only pay the price of blood to quell this matter. From then on, Violet Cloud became one of the top ten Cleric Gods in the entire world. This incident caused the upper-echelons of Ouroboros to greatly regret not asking her to stay all those years ago.As a result of this incident, everyone made fun of the inability of the upper-echelons of Ouroboros. Instead of utilizing those with potential, they were only using those boot-lickers whom they were fond of. In the end, they had missed the chance to become a Super-Guild.However, Shi Feng could not find a Guild insignia on Violet Cloud\u2019s person right now.In addition to Violet Cloud\u2019s current appearance, Shi Feng could guess Violet Cloud must have been discovered by the Snow Goddess later on, which in turn resulted in Violet Cloud feeling indebted to the Snow Goddess. Hence, Violet Cloud left Ouroboros when the Snow Goddess stopped playing God\u2019s Domain.Meanwhile, Violet Cloud currently had yet to meet the Snow Goddess. It was the perfect chance for Shi Feng to recruit her. Even if Violet Cloud was unskilled now, she had the potential to become a Cleric God. As long as she was properly nurtured, she would definitely be able to become a Cleric God in the future.Violet Cloud was no idiot. When she heard Shi Feng saying so, she stared at Shi Feng in a panic, both her hands covering her poorly-developed chest as she retreated a step.\u201cSir, aside from selling Fruit Juice, I won\u2019t be selling anything else. If you are regretting it now, you can take back your money.\u201d Violet Cloud handed over the Silver Coins she had just received. However, her eyes still carried with them a hint of unwillingness as she did.At her time of despair, a person suddenly emerged, saying that he wanted to purchase a thousand cups of Fruit Juice. Moreover, he was even willing to wait for thirty hours without reducing her pay. She would not believe Shi Feng had no ulterior motives, even if she were beaten to death.Forget Violet Cloud; even the surrounding players would not believe it. If Shi Feng did not have any ulterior motives, why would he save her? He even spent 10 Silver Coins to buy those unwanted beverages.Shi Feng looked at Violet Cloud\u2019s vigilant expression and actions. He then looked towards her smooth flat chest, suddenly laughing, \u201cYou\u2019re overthinking things. I really have no interest towards your flatlands. I\u2019m only buying this many because I just happened to have a use for Fruit Juice. If you don\u2019t wish to sell them to me, then so be it. I\u2019ll just find someone else to buy them from.\u201dSaying so, Shi Feng released Drifting Blood as he turned away and left.However, Drifting Blood was not willing to let Shi Feng go. Shi Feng publicly humiliated him by forcing him to kneel with just a single hand. Moreover, when has Martial Union been afraid of anyone?Since the Guards didn\u2019t seem to be paying attention, it would be extremely easy to get rid of Shi Feng.Thinking so, Drifting Blood pulled out a weapon and used Charge at Shi Feng.With his sensitive five senses, Shi Feng naturally knew of Drifting Blood\u2019s actions. Shi Feng spun around to face him, pulling out the Abyssal Blade and using parry.Dang! Drifting Blood\u2019s greatsword hacked at Shi Feng\u2019s sword. Instead of hurting Shi Feng however, Drifting Blood was knocked back by three yards. The durability of the greatsword in his hands instantly reduced by 2 points, and he looked at Shi Feng in shock.He did not understand how a person like Shi Feng would have such great strength. Shi Feng was like a beast in human skin.The surrounding players were similarly shocked. Drifting Blood was a Berserker, so he must have definitely added a lot of Strength points. He was also at Level 3, similar to Shi Feng; so how could the gap between them be so great?These players did not know, however, that this was still only half of Shi Feng\u2019s real Strength.After all, Shi Feng could obtain 6 Free Attribute Points for every increase to his level. It was 1.5 times that of an average player. Not to mention Shi Feng\u2019s body was protected by Bronze and Mysterious-Iron Equipment. There was even the powerful Magic Weapon. Even with just half of these aspects, Shi Feng\u2019s Strength far exceeded the average player.If Shi Feng\u2019s Strength had not been reduced by half, just by activating the Strength Hidden Basic Skill and the Strength provided by the Magic Weapon, Shi Feng could destroy that basic greatsword without a problem.\u201cBrat, you\u2019re courting death! See how I\u2019ll take care of you!\u201c Drifting Blood naturally would not believe that Shi Feng was his match. He immediately stood back up, lifting his greatsword as he looked at Shi Feng.\u201cIdiot.\u201d Shi Feng sheathed the Abyssal Blade, having completely lost interest in Drifting Blood.Watching Shi Feng store his weapon, Drifting Blood thought Shi Feng had become afraid and wanted to beg for mercy. However, he would not forgive Shi Feng. Drifting Blood further increased the power in his hands.Just as Drifting Blood was about to slash at Shi Feng, he was immediately sent into a Fainted state. Before Drifting Blood could turn around and curse the bastard that attacked him, he suddenly discovered six silvery-white armored Guards standing before him. Without saying anything further, the Guards placed Drifting Blood in shackles.\u201cYou\u2019ve violated a Town Law, take a trip with us. Any resistance and you\u2019ll be killed without consideration,\u201d the two Guards grabbed Drifting Blood from both sides, turning around and dragging him away.\u201cCrap, you\u2019ve got the wrong person! I\u2019m just an ordinary citizen! It\u2019s that bastard who attacked me first! You guys should be arresting him!\u201d Drifting Blood continuously pointed at Shi Feng, yelling injustice in rage. However, the Guards paid no attention to his bellowing, taking him away immediately.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEveryone was also in shock. Why did the Guards only appear now? Moreover, they even apprehended the wrong person. What sort of situation was this, exactly?Could Shi Feng actually be an NPC, a part of the nobility? Only Nobles would have such authority.To the side, Violet Cloud had a blank expression on her face, unable to make sense of the situation. Why didn\u2019t the Guards arrest Shi Feng? Instead, they arrested Drifting Blood. Was Shi Feng really a Noble NPC?Violet Cloud\u2019s eyes were filled with reluctance as she watched Shi Feng leaving. She bit her rosy lips, her delicate hands tightly gripping the hem of her shirt.Of course, she was not reacting so because of how handsome Shi Feng was, but instead, she was truly in need of money. Those 10 Silver Counts were too important to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61 \u2013 PoachingJust as everyone was guessing whether or not Shi Feng was a Noble NPC\u2026As Drifting Blood was being dragged away, he glared at Shi Feng with eyes of a poisonous snake, bellowing, \u201cBrat, just you wait. I\u2019ll remember you now. Our Martial Union will not let you off. I\u2019ll still be a good guy when I come out twelve hours later. When that time comes, there would be no place in Red Leaf Town for you.\u201dEveryone felt chills down their backs as they heard Drifting Blood\u2019s malicious threat. Was he planning to fight to the death?However, no one dared to belittle Shi Feng any longer. Just by judging from his single action just now, they knew Shi Feng was not as simple as he looked.Martial Union was a relatively famous Guild in Red Leaf Town. They were very well-known in other Wuxia virtual reality games. They were not a Guild managed by a Workshop, but instead, they were a Guild that was managed by casual gamers. Including investments from a few wealthy personages, Martial Union also started establishing a foothold in God\u2019s Domain. Although they did not reach the standards of a third-rate Guild, they were not a Guild to be taken lightly.Currently, God\u2019s Domain monopolized the entire virtual gaming industry. Under the support of the recently developed Main God System, God\u2019s Domain did not require humans for operation. The Main God System assured fairness in the game, and it would also constantly evolve the game, continuously pumping out various Quests, Dungeons, hidden locations, and so on. God\u2019s Domain was a living game, and it was something that no other virtual reality game could compare to.The maps in God\u2019s Domain were also immensely vast, sufficient for the entire population of Earth. Moreover, a majority of the things available in real life could also be experienced within the game, in addition to things that could not be found in real life. God\u2019s Domain was slowly trending towards becoming a second world, and other virtual reality games had no chance of competing with it.After Drifting Blood was dragged away by the Guards, everyone\u2019s gaze turned towards Shi Feng. They all held curiosity on their faces, and their eyes tried to see through Shi Feng. They wanted to know whether or not Shi Feng was an NPC. Unfortunately, no matter what kind of observation skills they used, the results told them that Shi Feng was 100% a player and not an NPC.This only further increased everyone\u2019s confusion. Yet, nobody dared to go over and ask Shi Feng, as Shi Feng might not even answer them. If by chance they were to cause Shi Feng displeasure, who knew, they might be the next Drifting Blood.Shi Feng looked at the puzzled faces of the people around him. He merely revealed a faint smile at the sight as he turned to leave.After living in God\u2019s Domain for ten years, he long since clearly understood the rules of God\u2019s Domain. A player would be captured and jailed if he were to attack another player inside a Safe Zone. However, as long as an action did not cause any damage, even if it were an intense bodily contact, the Guards would not pay heed to it.Pressing onto Drifting Blood and clapping his shoulders were both actions that did not cause damage. It was just that the strength behind it was different than what one would normally use for such actions. Naturally, the Guards would not care about such actions. However, Drifting Blood used Charge, a skill that would cause the target to enter into a Fainted state in addition to damage. Moreover, there were also his aggressive actions. The Guards naturally would not let him off freely.Meanwhile, female players only had to activate the Anti-harassment System to prevent harassing players from doing anything to them. However, Violet Cloud just recently entered God\u2019s Domain, so it was natural for her not to know about it.Regarding Drifting Blood\u2019s threat, Shi Feng paid no heed to it. Martial Union was a Guild that did not even reach the standard of third-rate. Shi Feng previously used to lead the weak Shadow to stand off against many first-rate Guilds, and these first-rate Guilds were helpless dealing with them. Martial Union, a leisure Guild that only had several thousand players, was not worth even mentioning.If they wished to find trouble with him, he would just deal with them. As a reincarnated person with a Magic Weapon in hand, what was he afraid of?As for deepening his relationship with Violet Cloud, Shi Feng could only leave it aside for now as he searched for another way. The girl\u2019s vigilance was just too heavy for him to get through. However, Shi Feng understood her reasons. If it were the Snow Goddess standing in his place, Violet Cloud might have a different reaction.Shi Feng bitterly laughed, shaking his head as he left.\u201cSir, please hold on a moment,\u201d Violet Cloud finally said, no longer able to endure it. The enticement of 10 Silver Coins was just too great. This was her biggest chance. If she were to miss it, what would happen to her sick mother?\u201cOh? Did you change your mind?\u201d Shi Feng turned around to look at Violet Cloud\u2019s troubled expression, smiling as he spoke.Violet Cloud stayed on guard as she looked at Shi Feng\u2019s eyes, trying to discern any bad intentions within them. However, no matter how she looked at them, she could not discover any special emotions within them. Instead, she could feel a vast ocean hidden within the depths of Shi Feng\u2019s eyes. However, she still asked in caution, \u201cYou truly want only the Fruit Juice and absolutely won\u2019t have other requests?\u201dShi Feng was sweating profusely in his heart. For her to seek confirmation over and over\u2026 just how unreliable was he? He would have left long ago, were it not for her potential to become a Cleric God, as even he was unable to endure being thought of as a lecherous bastard by others.\u201cIn any case, I\u2019m in need of a Chef to make some things for me. How about this? We\u2019ll set up a contract, and I\u2019ll hire you to be my Chef. I\u2019ll give you the same treatment as a Lifestyle player in a third-rate Guild. You should be able to relax with the Main God System\u2019s guarantee. If you don\u2019t have any problems, then follow me. If you still can\u2019t feel reassured, then just stay here,\u201d Shi Feng let out a sigh, speaking unhurriedly.Violet Cloud was dumbfounded. The man before her was actually hiring her, and he was even giving her an ordinary job. It should be known that Chef was a Lifestyle Job that nobody thought highly of; no one ever hired Chef players.She had heard before, from her best friend, the treatment of a Lifestyle player in a third-rate guild. At that time, her friend even showed off that her boyfriend was a Lifestyle player in a third-rate Guild and how great the monthly treatment he received was. If he performed well, there would even be various kinds of benefits. The treatment was much better than many jobs that were available in real life, and this caused Violet Cloud to be extremely envious.\u201cI\u2019ll follow you. However, I work very slowly. Is there really no problem?\u201d Violet Cloud ground her teeth, deciding to agree with Shi Feng. If she were to let go of this chance, what sort of future awaited her? Judging from his various performances, Shi Feng did not seem like a bad person. Moreover, she was just a very ordinary female player. There was absolutely no need for him to conspire and trick her. This was a virtual world. If she did not reveal her address in real life, Shi Feng would not be able to track her at all. Moreover, Shi Feng would have to bear a great risk in doing so.\u201cFollow me then. I still have some things I need to buy,\u201d Shi Feng nodded his head, appearing to be very calm. However, inwardly, he was in ecstasy. He had swindled a Cleric God into his hands, just like that. As for the Snow Goddess, Shi Feng could only apologize and say, \u201cfirst come, first served.\u201dSubsequently, Violet Cloud left with Shi Feng.Shi Feng brought along Violet Cloud, returning to the Grocery Shop once more. He bought an assortment of equipment used by Chefs such as Pots, Spatulas, Knives, and so on, spending less than 2 Silver Coins in total. Afterward, he went to the Chef\u2019s Association, spending 1 Silver Coin to purchase two sheets of Basic Cooking Recipes. One was a recipe for cooking Wolf Meat, the other for making an Energizing Drink. At the same time, he spent an additional 5 Silver Coins purchasing plenty of materials that were required by these recipes, as well as the materials for the Fruit Juice.Violet Cloud was shocked by Shi Feng\u2019s actions. He actually spent so much money, buying so many things. He was just too rich. Her previous notion of Shi Feng being unreliable completely changed now.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe materials and recipes Shi Feng had spent so much money buying were sufficient to allow her to promote herself to an Advanced Apprentice Chef. This was a treatment not even the Lifestyle players of first-rate Guilds would receive.However, what Violet Cloud did not know of was that Shi Feng felt that these items were very cheap. It was truly easy to nurture a Chef.All the materials required by the recipes could be bought from the NPC, and it only took 10 Silver Coins to nurture an Advanced Apprentice Chef. Such an amount of money would not even be enough to squander for nurturing a Forger or Potionmaker.Shi Feng then rented a Basic Kitchen, bringing Violet Cloud to it.\u201cAfter you sign the contract, all these materials and recipes will belong to you. You only need to create 900 cups of Fruit Juice first. Then, use everything remaining for these two recipes. You will receive a 20% share when these items are sold. At the same time, depending on your results, I\u2019ll decide your base salary every month. If you try to run away, you\u2019ll have to compensate me ten times that amount. Sign it if you don\u2019t have any problems,\u201d Shi Feng brought out a standard employment contract for Lifestyle players from the Main God System. Aside from having different treatments, these contracts were the same as others. There were no loopholes in them, and the law held effect over it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62 \u2013 Moonlight ForestViolet Cloud was in a daze for a long time after reading the contract. She believed she was in a dream.She heard before the treatment Lifestyle players received in third-rate Guilds. The treatment she would be receiving was definitely better than those Lifestyle players. It was especially true for the base salary. Lifestyle players of third-rate Guilds definitely did not receive such treatment.\u201cWhy are you being so good to me?\u201d Violet Cloud looked at Shi Feng with wide, teary eyes, asking. She wanted to know the reason.\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand; I\u2019m only in need of a Chef. I\u2019ve only hired you because I can see you\u2019re a very hardworking and earnest person. If you try to take advantage of the situation and fail to hit my requirements, then you can get lost. I\u2019m not interested in nurturing someone useless,\u201d Shi Feng suddenly spoke in a grave tone. He wanted Violet Cloud to know that it was not easy to become his personal Chef. That was because people were bound to become wasteful when they constantly received things without effort.Violet Cloud was frightened after being told so by Shi Feng. She lowered her head, no longer daring to ask any more silly questions. Judging from Shi Feng\u2019s attitude, it was clear that he was indeed looking for a Chef, and that she had just been chosen by chance. Hence, Violet Cloud lifted the pen and signed the contract.This was her final chance at escaping her desperate situation. She definitely must grab ahold of it.\u201cBoss, will I be making them here?\u201d Violet Cloud immediately entered her role, appearing very respectful. She took a look at her surroundings. The environment here was very good, and it was also very peaceful. However, the rental for the Basic Kitchen was by no means cheap.\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll be manufacturing the items here from now on. I\u2019ve already applied for the membership here so that you can come here anytime. There is enough money stored for you to use a long period. There won\u2019t be anyone here to disturb you. The facilities here are also thorough, so your success rate can be increased by quite a bit. If you don\u2019t have any problems, then you can start working now. In thirty hours, if I don\u2019t see the nine hundred cups of Fruit Juice, then you may leave.\u201d Shi Feng was very satisfied with Violet Cloud\u2019s attitude. He turned and left after finished saying his piece.As for luring Violet Cloud onto the path of battles and leveling, more time would be needed to slowly lead her towards that path. Moreover, Shi Feng had a great purpose for Fruit Juice. It would not be a bad choice to allow Violet Cloud to make them for him.Violet Cloud\u2019s eyes followed Shi Feng\u2019s back as he left. Her heart was filled with gratitude towards Shi Feng. She made a firm resolution to work properly and to not disappoint her new boss.After leaving the Chef\u2019s Association, Shi Feng returned to the Forging Association.Currently, the number of Forgers in the Forging Association was constantly increasing. These players formed small conversation groups, either discussing how to increase their success rates or discussing the struggle between Hammer Trading and the mysterious forger. The two had become the target of envy, as well as idols of worship for these players.\u201cDid you see the article posted by Hammer Trading just now?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019ve seen it. I never imagined Hammer Trading would be so hot-tempered as to actually insistent on challenging the mysterious forger. He even declared that the first one to withdraw from this price war would be a \u2018son of a bitch.\u2019\u201d\u201cAh, I truly envy them. They had actually obtained a Bronze Forging Design. How great would it be if I could have one as well? At the very least, I could join a third-rate Guild if I had one.\u201d\u201cWhat do you even know? I\u2019ve heard the Forgers that are in Guilds saying that the drop rate for Bronze Forging Designs is frighteningly low. Moreover, its success rate is also shockingly low. Currently, selling them for 3 to 4 Silver Coins per piece is just a complete loss. The Glimmer Chestplate with better Attributes would create an even bigger loss. On the other hand, the various Guilds are all in cheerful moods, even thanking Hammer Trading for his actions. Otherwise, how would they be able to buy Bronze Equipment at such low prices?\u201d\u201cTruthfully speaking, I dislike that Hammer Trading very much. Was it bad to let all Forgers profit together? Why must he insist on challenging the mysterious forger to the very end, causing both sides to suffer?\u201dHearing the discussions of these players, Shi Feng entered deep thought. After a moment, he revealed a faint smile. Judging from Hammer Trading\u2019s actions, it was clear that he was currently having a hard time. The Silver Coins in his possession were definitely insufficient, and he must be wantonly purchasing Silver Coins from the market right now. This would lead to a great increase in prices for Silver Coins, so it was the perfect chance for Shi Feng to sell them.Shi Feng wanted to thank Hammer Trading. If it were not for him, the market for equipment would not be as lively as it is now.Currently, there would be a large amount of Silver Coins entering his pockets every so often. Meanwhile, although Shi Feng had spent quite a lot of it, the amount of money he possessed was still madly increasing. The money he possessed had already reached 3 Gold Coins.At the reception desk, Shi Feng once more rented an Intermediate Forging Room for five hours, starting a new round of forging and manufacturing.However, before he started forging, Shi Feng entered the Virtual Center. He wanted to check the prices for God\u2019s Domain\u2019s game currency and sell some of the game currency he possessed. Just leaving it in his pockets was truly a waste.Shi Feng was in the dark when he did not check, but the moment he did, he was shocked.Although there was a large number of players in God\u2019s Domain, the number of players who were selling the game\u2019s currency did not exceed a hundred. More importantly, the selling prices were astonishing. A single Silver Coin was selling for 60 Credits. The price was at least double of that during Shi Feng\u2019s previous life. However, the number of Silver Coins sold by these players were very small, mostly around 2 to 3 Silver Coins per player. Aside from the sellers, there were also players who were buying God\u2019s Domain currency in bulk. The lowest buying price was at 55 Credits per Silver Coin, while the highest was at 58 Credits per Silver Coin.That meant that a single Silver Coin in God\u2019s Domain was enough for Shi Feng to eat in luxury for two days.It was because of this competition that caused the prices of Silver Coins to be so expensive.At the current stage of the game, so long as a person had a brain, they would know not to sell any of their game currency. On the other hand, there were many Guilds who were purchasing game currencies in bulk, at a reasonable price. There were only a scant few money-farming groups and Workshops who would sell some of their currency. However, the amount they sold was extremely low. Moreover, their prices were extremely high. Only as a last resort would the various Guilds buy currency from these groups.However, these Guilds knew the price competition for equipment was a great chance for them to reap some benefits. So, they would definitely purchase game currency in bulk. However, there was not that much game currency available for sale. They could only purchase the game currency sold at the Virtual Center. Moreover, where did the large amount of game currency flow to?A majority of it was definitely in Shi Feng\u2019s pockets, while a minority was at the material merchant\u2019s side.That meant Shi Feng was currently a big shot at selling game currency. Even a hundred-man money-farming group was far from being able to compare with Shi Feng.Without hesitation, Shi Feng immediately placed 3 Gold Coins up for sale, selling each Silver Coin at 60 Credits. Shi Feng still needed to collect the money to buy two virtual gaming helmets, so how could he be polite with these tycoons?Although the price was slightly high, to obtain equipment, the many Guilds in White River City will definitely buy them. When that time came, all these game currencies would eventually return to his hands.After settling this matter, Shi Feng started focusing on forging equipment and manufacturing Forging Designs.Five hours went by quickly. Shi Feng once more forged more than 80 Glimmer Chestplates and 50 Forging Designs for the Glimmer Chestplate. The 200,000 EXP required by the Teleportation Orb had been filled, and his own experience had also increased by quite a lot. He was just 22% away from Level 4 now, and he was just short of slightly more than 200 Proficiency Points before becoming an Intermediate Forging Apprentice.In this forging session, the Forging Designs made were the most valuable when compared to the equipment made. Looking at the current popularity of the Glimmer Chestplate, the various Guilds were definitely in a rush to obtain their own Bronze Equipment Forging Design. They wanted to nurture their own forgers and create their own Bronze Equipment. After all, the drop rate of Bronze Equipment was extremely low. There were also not that many Elite monsters available to hunt.In regards to the millions of players in White River City, the amount of equipment sold by Shi Feng and Hammer Trading was insignificant. There were still swarms of players requiring the equipment.After leaving the Forging Room, the amount of money in Shi Feng\u2019s pockets once more increased by a lot. Hence, Shi Feng made a trip to the Trade Area, once more purchasing Stones and Hard Stones. He then cleared out the Card Sets and Hard Stones that were sold at the Auction House, and in turn, placing the over 80 Glimmer Chestplates on auction. However, the selling price for the equipment this time was slightly different. The minimum price was no longer at 4 Silver Coins but 3 Silver Coins.Hammer Trading was quickly nearing insanity from the competition. When Hammer Trading saw Shi Feng had once again lowered his selling price, Hammer Trading even spat out blood. Now that Shi Feng reduced his selling price, naturally, Hammer Trading had to reduce his as well. Did Shi Feng want him to sell a kidney?! Must he be so merciless?!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe person himself, however, did not put much consideration into such matters. Shi Feng only wanted to advertise the Glimmer Chestplate.After leaving the Auction House, Shi Feng stored the Philosopher\u2019s Stone and materials in the Bank. Afterward, Shi Feng went to the Pharmacy to purchase two stacks of Basic Regeneration Potions. He then went to the Magic Shop, purchasing over ten types of Magic Scrolls. He bought 5 pieces of each kind, and each piece cost around 20 to 40 Coppers.Now that the experience required by the Teleportation Magic Orb has been fully collected, Shi Feng could go to the Moonlight Forest.However, the Moonlight Forest was not an easy and relaxing place to stay. On the contrary, crisis came one after another there, making the place extremely dangerous. Players dubbed the map as the Land of Eternal Rest. Without proper preparations, players would definitely die ten out of ten times there.The scrolls Shi Feng bought were all necessary tools for him to survive in the wilderness. Before, he did not have that much money, so he did not bother with purchasing the Magic Scrolls. Now that he did, he naturally would not be courteous. At the very least, these scrolls could improve his survival chances there, rather dying nine out of ten times.Following which, Shi Feng searched for a deserted location and activated the Teleportation Magic Orb. Shi Feng then transformed into a streak of white light, vanishing from Red Leaf Town.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63 \u2013 Mountain Beast FighterThe sky was a dull grey. A full moon shone, scattering faint silvery rays throughout the tranquil forest. From the crystal clear lake, one could hear the croaking of frogs. Fireflies were dancing throughout the forest. The scene was like a fantasy from a children\u2019s fairy tale.This place was the Moonlight Forest, also known as the \u2018Land of Eternal Rest\u2019 by players.The moment Shi Feng arrived at this place, the first thing he did was take out an Isolation Scroll. Immediately, he activated the magic contained within the scroll.The dazzling magical runes written on the scroll came rushing out, and Shi Feng\u2019s body suddenly became blurry. If looking from a far distance, it was very hard to notice Shi Feng\u2019s existence.Each Isolation Scroll cost 40 Copper Coins. It was practically the entire fortune of an average player.Although the price was high, its effects were remarkable. The Isolation Scroll could greatly decrease a player\u2019s sense of presence, making it hard for surrounding enemies to discover them. The scroll had a duration of half an hour, and it was a must-have tool when exploring dangerous areas.Although it was not as effective as an Assassin\u2019s Stealth, it was better than nothing for Jobs that did not possess Stealth.When the Isolation Scroll was used, within a 30-yard radius, players would not be easily discovered by Common Monsters below Level 15. Unless, of course, said player was courting death and attacked the monster.Following which, Shi Feng infiltrated the forest. He headed towards the central region of the Moonlight Forest in search of Moonstones, wanting to remove the hateful curse even a little faster.The Moonlight Forest was a Level 9 monster area. Its location was not in Star-Moon Kingdom, but an isolated space. Every City had a Teleportation Gate directed towards the Moonlight Forest. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, over 90% of the Level 9 players in God\u2019s Domain would grind for treasure here. However, even if a player were already Level 10, the place would still massacre them. That was because the monsters here usually stayed in groups of three to five, and they possessed powerful skills. A single misstep could cause a party-wipe. Even so, players would still persevere, rushing to their deaths over and over as if they were possessed. As a result of the constant deaths, the Moonlight Forest was referred to by others as the Land of Eternal Rest.Meanwhile, the reason these players would persevere to such a degree was mainly that the monsters here dropped Gemstones. Moreover, the drop rate was relatively high. The number of Treasure Chests here was also high. As long as one found a Treasure Chest, there was an 80% chance to obtain Gemstones.Gemstones were very valuable in God\u2019s Domain. The reason being, they were able to increase the Attributes of a piece of equipment. Depending on the color of the Gemstones, the Attributes they increased were also different: red increased Strength, yellow increased Agility, blue increased Endurance, purple increased Intelligence, and green increased Vitality. A Tier 1 Gemstone could increase an Attribute by 2 points. However, such an amount must not be belittled. A piece of Bronze Equipment could have one Gemstone embed into it, whereas a piece of Mysterious-Iron Equipment could have two Gemstones into it. If every piece of equipment worn by a player were outfitted with Gemstones, a number of accumulated Attributes would be very terrifying.That was why the demand for Gemstones was extremely great. The prices of Gemstones would always remain high, causing many players to take the great risk of farming Gemstones at the Moonlight Forest.Moreover, there were various resources such as ore, herbs, rare food materials, and so on in the Moonlight Forest. However, the most well-known part about the Moonlight Forest was still the fifty-man Dungeon, the \u201cSleeping Fortress,\u201d that resided there. The Dungeon was also the location to exchange Card Sets. However, only after the Dungeon had been cleared by a team, would players of the same Area be allowed to enter the Dungeon to exchange their Card Sets.However, Shi Feng\u2019s current goal was not the Card Sets, but the Moonstones. The Moonstones could only be found in the core area of the Moonlight Forest. Only, Shi Feng could not help but be careful when taking action. Not mentioning the extreme dangers found in the Moonlight Forest, Shi Feng was just Level 3 right now, and he was entering a Level 9 monster area.If he were to die an accidental death, then the 200,000 EXP he collected would be for naught, and he would have to start collecting it all over again. He had yet to reach Level 10, so he could not activate the Teleportation Gate found in Cities. If he were to die, his only choice was to return to Red Leaf Town; if he wished to return to this place, his only choice was to collect the required experience.Currently, Shi Feng was far behind the leading experts regarding level. It would be an absolute nightmare if Shi Feng were to die once and have to collect another 200,000 EXP.Just after entering the forest, Shi Feng could see Level 9 Shadow Leopards hiding either up in the trees or in the bushes, each of them prepared to ambush their foe. If it were not for the Isolation Scroll, Shi Feng would have long since been discovered.Shi Feng naturally wasn\u2019t an opponent for a Level 9 monster, so he could only avoid them. Besides, his goal here was not to kill monsters, and even more so, there was no need for him to pick a fight with the Shadow Leopards.Shi Feng carefully circled the Shadow Leopards, one after another. After spending more than an hour doing so, he arrived at a wide and towering forest made of stone.In this stone forest existed a group of battle maniacs called Mountain Beast Fighters. They were a group of tenacious warriors that did not fear suffering. The thing they loved most was battling, and the fiercer, the better. At the same time, they were also guarding a large pile of treasure, and amongst the treasure was the rarely seen Moonstone.However, the entire stone forest was filled with these armored, gigantic creatures. Wielding a spiked club the height of two people, these creatures patrolled the stone forest, preventing anyone from entering. If Shi Feng were to set foot in the stone forest, there was a 100% chance for him to be discovered. At that time, a group of those Mountain Beast Fighters would come rushing over, and a swing from each of those spiked clubs would easily turn Shi Feng into meat paste.[Mountain Beast Fighter] (Common Rank)Level 9HP 1100/1100\u201cLooks like I can only clear the way slowly.\u201d After searching for half a day, Shi Feng still could not find any safe way to penetrate the heart of the forest. His only choice was to kill his way there.Shi Feng could not help but admit that the difficulty of an Epic Quest was indeed very hard. This was just the beginning, yet he was already required to face off against the Level 9 Mountain Beast Fighters. He did not know what kinds of challenges he would meet further down the line.Fortunately, he was very familiar with the terrain of the Moonlight Forest. He knew many methods to deal with the Beast Warriors before him.The Mountain Beast Fighters were abnormally powerful, and their attacks were out of the ordinary. Even Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights of an equal level were unable to take more than a few hits from them. However, their bodies were enormous, resulting in their Movement Speed being relatively slow. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, there were many Elementalists who used Frost Arrow to reduce their speed. They then utilized the unique terrain of the stone forest to avoid the attacks from the spiked clubs, kiting and killing the Mountain Beast Fighters.Following which, this stone forest became a holy ground for ranged players. Mountain Beast Fighters could be seen being kited through various means throughout the stone forest.Although Shi Feng did not possess any speed reduction skills, he could use other methods to supplement it. As for kiting the Mountain Beast Fighters, he had the rare skill, Defensive Blade[1], which could increase his attack range by quite a lot. Shi Feng did not believe that a Sword King expert, such as himself, could not beat a Level 10 Elementalist regarding utilizing the terrain to dodge attacks.After properly observing the terrain, Shi Feng ran practice simulations in his mind a total of five times.Carrying out mental simulations would have a tremendous effect during actual operation. Hence, every expert would often carry out mental simulations of the operation before actually taking action.The reason why experts were experts, was because of the preparations they made were much greater than others.There would often be many average players who would admire the experts in God\u2019s Domain. They would lament over their own skills being poor, determining that they would never be able to reach the level of these experts. In reality, however, they did not know how great of an effort these experts were putting into each day. The suffering these experts went through each day far exceeded the average player. It was the reason why they could shine brilliantly.After running through the simulations, Shi Feng took out a Black Steel Beer and a Speed Scroll.The Black Steel Beer could reduce a monster\u2019s level by 2. In addition to the Attributes of the Abyssal Blade, Shi Feng would not be suppressed due to the level difference, even when facing a Level 9 monster. He would be able to deal damage normally. As for the Speed Scroll, each one of them cost 25 Copper Coins. It increased the user\u2019s Movement Speed by 25% for a duration of 10 minutes. This scroll was a lifesaving item when out in the wilderness. Shi Feng bought a total of twenty of them just for such occasions.If the average player were to learn about this, they would definitely curse Shi Feng as a spendthrift. Such an item would only be used when one was in a life or death crisis. Meanwhile, Shi Feng used it for killing Common Monsters. It was just too extravagant.If Shi Feng were not cursed, he could easily kite these monsters, just based on his Attributes. However, his Attributes were now reduced by 50%. The suppression was just too great, so it was safer to use a Speed Scroll.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf Shi Feng were to mess things up, it would not just be a matter of losing a level. He would have also wasted 200,000 EXP.Shi Feng took a deep breath, relaxing his body as he looked towards the closest Mountain Beast Fighter. Following which, his two feet exploded with strength, rushing towards the Mountain Beast Fighter.TL Notes:[1]Defensive Blade: Mentioned in Chapter 52Normal attacks range increased by 10 yards after use. Able to block up to a maximum of 6 ranged attacks or 3 melee attacks. Duration of 25 seconds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64 \u2013 Silvermoon Set EquipmentWhen the distance between Shi Feng and the Mountain Beast Fighter was less than 30 yards, the monster discovered Shi Feng speeding towards it. It widened its mouth and let out an ear-piercing battle cry. It raised its gigantic spiked club, using a Charge and rushing towards Shi Feng.Shi Feng immediately pulled out the Abyssal Blade. The blade slashed horizontally as Shi Feng used Parry.Peng! Shi Feng was knocked back by five yards, pulling some distance away from the Mountain Beast Fighter without taking any damage. After he landed, he immediately spun around and ran towards the stone forest.If players were hit by the Mountain Beast Fighter\u2019s Charge, the monster would immediately follow up with a Break to reduce the player\u2019s speed, preventing them from escaping.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, the Elementalists who were struck by the Beast Fighter\u2019s Charge would immediately use Frozen Nova to freeze the monster for 8 seconds. They would take the chance to gain some distance, then continue by kiting the monster. The Mountain Beast Fighters would only use Charge on the first meeting, using suppressing skills afterward. As long as the Elementalists did not let the monsters catch up to them, there would be no danger whatsoever.Also, nearby there were numerous large rocks that could be used to toy with the Mountain Beast Fighters, making the process of killing them a lot easier.After using the Speed Scroll, Shi Feng\u2019s speed was faster than the Mountain Beast Fighter just by a thread. It was not very obvious, but it was this small difference that prevented the Mountain Beast Fighter from catching up to him.After entering the densely packed stone forest, Shi Feng turned around and used Thundering Flash. From a distance of 15 yards, three sword rays immediately pierced through the Beast Fighter\u2019s armor, causing three damages of -15, -19, -13. Without the level suppression, even if Shi Feng\u2019s Attributes were reduced by 50%, his Attack Power and Skill Damage were still very powerful.After using the skill, Shi Feng\u2019s speed slightly reduced, and the Mountain Beast Fighter caught up to him within an instant. The Beast Fighter was clearly furious after being struck. It roared as it brandished its spiked club, smashing it at Shi Feng.Shi Feng hurriedly turned his body, hiding by a nearby rock. The spiked club did not land on Shi Feng; it only hit the stone and created a splash of broken rocks.During this attack, Shi Feng, once again, pulled a distance of over 8 yards away from the monster.After using Thundering Flash, Shi Feng activated Defensive Blade. His attack range suddenly increased to 15 yards. As long as he maintained a 5-yard distance between the Mountain Beast Fighter, the monster would not be able to land a hit on him.Shi Feng brandished his sword as he paid attention to the distance between him and the monster, pulling back to avoid the club whenever he was too close. In such a way, streak after streak of sword light landed on the Mountain Beast Fighter\u2019s body. The Beast Fighter could only bellow in helplessness as its HP continuously fell. It never imagined that a human could actually be so agile and cunning. Every time its attack was about to land, the human would dodge towards a nearby rock. Its bulky spiked club could not land a hit at all. Instead, it only served to create a gap between itself and the human.Just when the Mountain Beast Fighter\u2019s HP went below 7%, another Mountain Beast Fighter suddenly appeared from behind a rock. It blocked Shi Feng\u2019s path, using Charge at him.\u201cScram!\u201dFaced with the sudden appearance of another monster, Shi Feng immediately used Abyssal Bind on it, preventing the monster from moving. At the same time, the Abyssal Bind also canceled the life-threatening Charge.Since the Mountain Beast Fighter had been locked up, Shi Feng naturally would not let the skill go to waste. He immediately used Wind Blade, instantly shaking off the low HP Mountain Beast Fighter, and his blade landed on the bound Mountain Beast Fighter\u2019s neck. Shi Feng continued by using Double Chop, causing a Bleeding effect on the monster. He then used another Chop on the monster.Just within 3 seconds, Shi Feng had taken away 16% of this Mountain Beast Fighter\u2019s HP.Seeing as the low HP Mountain Beast Fighter was about to catch up, Shi Feng dodged and arrived at behind the restricted Beast Fighter.He raised the pitch black Abyssal Blade high, abruptly slashing down.Thundering Flash!Above the heads of both Mountain Beast Fighters, three consecutive damages of -16, -19, -23 appeared. The low HP Beast Warrior fell to the ground with a bang.System: Mountain Beast Fighter killed. Level difference of 6. EXP obtained increased by 600%. Obtained 36 EXP.Such an amount of experience could be considered negligible to Shi Feng, who was currently Level 3. On the other hand, the Proficiency Points for using skills were gained much faster. Every use would definitely increase the skill\u2019s proficiency by 3 points. This allowed Chop to quickly rise to Level 3. In addition to the Abyssal Blade\u2019s Attributes, Shi Feng\u2019s Chop was now Level 5; it\u2019s might greatly increasing. Double Chop had also risen to Level 2, and if the skill were used through the Abyssal Blade, it would be a Level 4 Double Chop. The damage caused by the Bleeding effect also increased significantly.The restricted Mountain Beast Fighter bellowed. It finally broke free from the chains, and it wanted to annihilate Shi Feng. However, Shi Feng gave it no chance. He immediately distanced himself 5 yards away from the monster and continued kiting it.Although the Defensive Blade had a long Cooldown and a short duration, by using Thundering Flash, Double Chop, and Parry in concert, Shi Feng could still slowly grind the Mountain Beast Fighter down.Not a minute later, another Mountain Beast Fighter fell.However, the Mountain Beast Fighters did not reward Shi Feng with anything special. There were only three pieces of Hard Stone and 2 Copper Coins. On the other hand, killing these Mountain Beast Fighters was a good way to grind Skill Proficiency Points.Subsequently, Shi Feng advanced forward while killing Mountain Beast Fighters. These monsters had a short respawn time, so from time to time, Shi Feng would attract two to three of these Mountain Beast Fighters. Fortunately, the stone forest had narrow spaces. This resulted in the Beast Fighters blocking each other\u2019s path, their numbers causing their speed to reduce instead.Seeing this, Shi Feng had sudden inspiration. He started luring more and more Mountain Beast Fighters, and within a short moment, he had lured over 20 of these monsters. The monsters chased after Shi Feng as a group, but the narrow pathways of the stone forest prevented them from even stretching their bodies. Just a slight movement and they would run into the other Mountain Beast Fighters. Such a situation allowed Shi Feng to become much more relaxed.Shi Feng constantly used Thundering Flash and various other skills to burn off the HP of the Mountain Beast Fighters behind him.Shi Feng kept luring new Mountain Beast Fighters as he attacked the ones behind him. In such a way, Shi Feng\u2019s Skill Proficiency Points increased without stop.After three hours, Thundering Flash had risen to Level 3; Chop had risen to Level 5, Double Chop to Level 4, Wind Blade to Level 3, Defensive Blade to Level 2, and Windwalk to Level 2.This increase allowed Shi Feng to kill monsters with greater ease. With the increase from the Abyssal Blade, the damage from a single Thundering Flash could take away over 90 HP from each Mountain Beast Fighter. A Chop could also cause more than 60 points of damage. The Bleeding damage caused by Double Chop was also very powerful.However, Shi Feng\u2019s level remained at 3. He was still quite a distance away from Level 4. If it were not for the curse, he would have long since risen in level.Looking at the ground littered with Mountain Beast Fighter corpses, Shi Feng decided to take a rest and pick up the loot. Otherwise, all these corpses would become too much of a hindrance.In God\u2019s Domain, if a player did not pick up the loot, the monster\u2019s corpse would require 24 hours before it was removed by the System.The loot from hundreds of Mountain Beast Fighters was extremely shocking. Just from the money dropped, there was already more than 4 Silver Coins. There was also a lot of materials. As for the Moonstones, seven pieces were dropped; it was still quite a distance away from thirty pieces. Moreover, a few pieces of Level 7 to Level 10 Common Equipment also dropped.\u201cEh? Isn\u2019t this a piece of the Silvermoon Set Equipment?\u201d Shi Feng picked up a silvery-white helmet from the ground, slightly shocked.[Silvermoon Helmet] (Bronze Plate Armor)Equipment Requirement: Strength 35Defense +43Strength +5, Agility +4, Endurance +4Battle Recovery +1Durability 40/40Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLimited to Berserkers and Swordsman.This helmet was one out of five pieces of equipment belonging to the Silvermoon Set Equipment. As long as two pieces of the set were collected, the first Set Effect could be activated. Four pieces of equipment were required for the second Set Effect, while all five pieces were needed for the third Set Effect. Each Set Effect was better than the previous. The Silvermoon Set Equipment was regarded as one of the best Set Equipment for Berserkers and Swordsmen below Level 10. However, its drop rate was extremely low, and it was extremely hard to gather a complete set.Unlike other equipment, the Silvermoon Set Equipment did not possess a Level Limit. It was only limited by Attributes. So long as a player fulfilled the required Attributes, they would be able to wear it.Suddenly, Shi Feng grew a great interest towards the Silvermoon Set Equipment.Maybe it was because the map had yet to be populated, so the drop rate right now was so high. If Shi Feng were to miss out on this chance, he would definitely regret it in the future.Thirty-five points in Strength, to the average player, they would most likely need to reach Level 8 or Level 9 before they would be able to wear this equipment. However, with Shi Feng\u2019s Attributes, he would be able to wear it as long as he removed the curse and reached Level 5. If he were to collect the complete set, his Attributes would literally soar to the sky. At that time, killing a Level 5 Shield Warrior with a full body of Bronze Equipment would just be child\u2019s play. Just the thought of it excited Shi Feng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had completely forgotten that the Moonlight Forest was an unexplored map. The treasures here were bountiful beyond comparison. It was just that, in Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, when he arrived at the Moonlight Forest, the place had long since been ransacked by those experts of first-rate and second-rate Guilds, leaving only scraps behind. Even then, Shi Feng still had to compete with the other Guilds for them.As for the average players, they didn\u2019t even have the chance to obtain those second-hand goods.By the time the average players arrived, who knew how many times the Moonlight Forest had been ransacked. However, these players still treated this place as a treasured land. One could imagine just how attractive the untouched Moonlight Forest was.Now that he was here, a step ahead, those first-rate and second-rate Guilds would not have their turn. He would personally explore every corner of the Moonlight Forest and plunder everything, letting those Guilds have a taste of getting second-hand goods.Two hours later, Shi Feng finally arrived at the core of the stone forest. On his way here, Shi Feng continuously killed Mountain Beast Fighters, obtaining 3 more pieces of Moonstone and a lot of money and materials.By chance, Shi Feng had discovered a camp made by the Mountain Beast Fighters. The camp was guarded by Mountain Beast Fighters on all sides, and just a rough calculation told Shi Feng that there were over forty of these monsters. Moreover, there were several squads of Mountain Beast Fighters patrolling near the camp. All in all, their numbers totaled past one hundred.The Mountain Beast Fighter\u2019s camp was where they stored their treasures. Many Guilds would often send teams consisting of twenty Elite players to do a sweep on the various monster camps in the Moonlight Forest. Their harvests, every time they did so, were relatively good.Meanwhile, the Mountain Beast Fighter camp in front of Shi Feng had never been raided before. There was definitely a great treasure in there. Shi Feng might even be able to finish collecting the required Moonstone and obtain many Tier 1 Gemstones and equipment.However, every monster camp was not easy to deal with. If there were not a lot of rocks here, Shi Feng would not have paid any attention to the camp and would have most likely turned around and left already. But, the rocks here were much more concentrated. The pathways surrounding the camp could, at most, fit two Beast Fighters, while the narrower places could only fit one. It was definitely a good location to grind Mountain Beast Fighters. It would be a great pity if Shi Feng were to give up here.Hence, Shi Feng picked a few small pieces of stone from the ground and stealthily closed in on the monster camp.To prevent unexpected elements, Shi Feng decided to lure all the Mountain Beast Fighters in one go. Otherwise, if he were to meet up with another group of Mountain Beast Fighters during his kiting, he would definitely drop dead.The important factor when luring these Mountain Beast Fighters was finding a way to deal with their Charge. If that were not properly handled, Shi Feng would end up dead from the unlimited Charges. He had personally been met with such a scenario before. His strength at that time had clearly exceeded the monsters by a large leap, yet, the monsters Charged at him one after another, placing him in a Fainted state until he died.Although each Mountain Beast Fighter only used Charge once, hundreds of those monsters still meant hundreds of Charges. Trying to get them to Charge all at the same time was extremely difficult.With his current HP, Shi Feng would not last two hits under the Mountain Beast Fighter\u2019s assault. Hence, he absolutely cannot make a mistake. He needed to let all the Mountain Beast Fighters simultaneously use Charge at him, then avoid the follow-up damage. Only then would he have a chance to get rid of all these Mountain Beast Fighters.He needed to get a good grasp on the timing when all the Mountain Beast Fighters rushed over. Otherwise, instead of grinding monsters, he would be the one beaten to a pulp. However, Shi Feng still held confidence in himself. After all, he was once a Sword King and a first-rate expert.The Mountain Beast Fighter on guard used its furry hand to caress its beloved niuweidao. It stood up high on the wall; its blood red eyes were constantly surveying its surroundings. As long as it discovered an intruder, it would immediately charge over and let its blade enjoy a delicious meal.Suddenly, a stone flew towards the Mountain Beast Fighter, striking its head. When the Beast Fighter turned its head towards the direction the stone came from, it discovered a human a distance away. There was also a piece of stone in the human\u2019s hand. Then, the Beast Fighter caressed its head that had been struck, suddenly entering a burning rage. A mere ant dared to throw a stone at it?!Hou! Hou! Hou!The roar from the Mountain Beast Fighter alarmed the entire nest of monsters. Mountain Beast Fighters came rushing out of the camp, one after another, all of them rushing to kill Shi Feng.Meanwhile, Shi Feng continued throwing stones towards the other squads of Mountain Beast Fighters. In just a short moment, he had enraged all of those monsters, causing them to rush at him.Seeing over a hundred Mountain Beast Fighters running towards him, Shi Feng remained unhurried. He used Phantom Kill, allowing his doppelganger to run into the stone forest while he faced off with the monsters.Not to mention Shi Feng alone, even a twenty-man Elite team would not be able to handle over a hundred Mountain Beast Fighters at the same time.As the distance between Shi Feng and the Mountain Beast Fighters shortened, Shi Feng\u2019s heart madly beat. His actions this time were insane. If there were even the tiniest mistake, only death awaited him. It had been a very long time since he had done something so exciting. His blood boiled, and his five senses grew even more sensitive.When the Mountain Beast Fighters were no more than thirty yards from Shi Feng, a majority of the beasts were within the range to use Charge.After a wrathful roar, a large majority of the Mountain Beast Fighters simultaneously activated Charge, with a few using it a moment later.Shi Feng immediately activated Defensive Blade. The skill could block three melee attacks. At the same time, Shi Feng gripped the Abyssal Blade and prepared to use Parry.When the first wave of monsters arrived, although Shi Feng used Parry, his body was still sent flying back. Following which, the second wave of monsters arrived, knocking Shi Feng into a Fainted state, preventing him from moving.Seeing many Mountain Beast Fighters raise their niuweidao, ready to strike, Shi Feng persevered and did not use any skills.Even when the blades slashed at him, Shi Feng still did not use the position swapping function of Phantom Kill. The Defensive Blade\u2019s damage immunity to three melee attacks instantly vanished.Afterward, Shi Feng was struck by the large blade; his HP instantly fell by half. Another strike was all it would take to finish him off now.At this time, the third wave of monsters had finally arrived. Shi Feng once more entered a Fainted state, the blade of the second niuweidao just before his eyes.\u201cSubstitute!\u201d Shi Feng shouted in his mind.Within an instant, Shi Feng and the doppelganger in the stone forest swapped places. After the blade slashed the doppelganger, the Charge of the fourth and final wave of monsters arrived. The doppelganger was simply beaten to death.Meanwhile, Shi Feng, who was hiding in the stone forest, immediately took out a bottle of Basic Regeneration Potion. He gulped it down in one go, a sweet and sour taste permeating throughout his mouth. Shi Feng\u2019s HP immediately recovered by 180 points, allowing him to barely be able to receive another attack.After the doppelganger died, the Hatred of the Mountain Beast Fighters was directed towards Shi Feng, who was currently in the stone forest. Immediately, they swarmed into the forest.Inside the forest was naturally Shi Feng\u2019s realm. He activated a Speed Scroll, facing off against the crazed Mountain Beast Fighters who were crowding through the narrow path. Shi Feng used Thundering Flash. Three streaks of lightning passed through the monsters, instantly taking over 100 HP from each of them.Within ten minutes, all the lured Mountain Beast Fighters were dead.At the same time, the remaining thread of experience Shi Feng needed to reach Level 4 had been filled up. He finally reached Level 4, catching up to the second tier players.Shi Feng placed all 6 Attribute Points into Strength. Currently, damage was his priority. After cleaning up the loot, Shi Feng actually obtained another piece of the Silvermoon Set Equipment, a Silvermoon Leg Guard. He had also obtained 7 pieces of Moonstone, two Tier 1 Gemstones, and all sorts of materials and Common Equipment. His harvest was relatively good.However, the most bountiful treasure was not these items. The main focus remained within the camp\u2019s storehouse. After all, Mountain Beast Fighters loved to place their collected treasures in the camp\u2019s storehouse.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter cleaning up the drops, Shi Feng quickly ran into the camp. He wanted to see just what sort of treasure was awaiting him inside the storehouse.\u201cAs expected for the first time. There really is a lot of treasure.\u201d From afar, Shi Feng could already see a few large Treasure Chests placed inside the storehouse. Amongst them, there was even a pitch black Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chest.Filled with excitement, Shi Feng was just about to enter the storehouse and take a look at the items within the treasure chests when he heard a loud roar.\u201cAo! Ao! Ao!\u201dA Mountain Beast Fighter, who was three sizes larger than its peers, rushed out from within the storehouse. The monster was covered in silver armor, and both its hands wielded a gigantic ax. Both its blood-red eyes stared tenaciously at Shi Feng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66 \u2013 Phantom KillAfter this silver armored Mountain Beast Fighter rushed out, before Shi Feng could observe it, it had already thrown its incomparably heavy Mountain Splitting Ax. The ax flew like a rocket, reaching Shi Feng in an instant.Everything happened too quickly, too suddenly. If it were an average player in this situation, their head would have parted with their body before they could even react.However, Shi Feng was not an average player. He pulled out the Abyssal Blade with great speed, and the moment before the ax could hack at his neck, he Parried this flying death ax.The collision between the giant ax and the longsword did not produce any sparks, only the sound of an explosion.Shi Feng\u2019s entire person was sent flying back over ten yards.Following which, the giant ax landed on the ground, deeply penetrating the earth. Its landing caused the earth to start shaking. It could be seen just how heavy this giant ax was. Moreover, the silver-armored Mountain Beast Fighter who could simply throw this giant ax was even more terrifying.Such strength did not exceed the normal Mountain Beast Fighters by just a level\u2026After landing, Shi Feng immediately used Observing Eyes on the new monster.[Mountain Beast Warrior] (Special Elite)Level 10HP 3500/3500Shi Feng immediately understood the Mountain Beast Warrior\u2019s strength after taking a look at these numbers. Without saying anything further, he turned tail and ran.What a joke. Directly battling against a Level 10 Special Elite was literally suicide. When meeting a Special Elite in the Moonlight Forest, players didn\u2019t have to consider whether or not they could kill it, rather whether or not they could run away.The Mountain Beast Warrior was stronger than the Mountain Beast Fighter by more than a notch. Not only regarding Strength, but its speed and flexibility were also greatly increased. It would not be easily toyed with like the Mountain Beast Fighters. If Shi Feng did not use Parry to defend against the ax, then, even if he had blocked the attack with the Abyssal Blade, he would still end up dead. The gap between their strength was just too huge.Although Shi Feng wished to escape, the Mountain Beast Warrior had no plans let this intruder go. It used Charge to rush at Shi Feng, picking up its giant ax along the way. The way it picked up the weapon was as if it were picking up a leaf, effortless.Seeing that the Mountain Beast Warrior had used Charge, Shi Feng knew he could not shake it off. He turned his body around in mid-air, pointing his sword at the Mountain Beast Warrior.Abyssal Bind!Within an instant, the Mountain Beast Warrior who was swiftly rushing at Shi Feng was restricted by pitch black chains. It could not move even a muscle, only helplessly stare at Shi Feng.Shi Feng did not dare stay any longer. He activated Windwalk, leaving the campsite at high speed and fleeing into the stone forest.With the added speed from Windwalk, the Mountain Beast Warrior had no chance of catching up to him.About twenty seconds later\u2026\u201cFinally broke away from it.\u201d Shi Feng turned his head around to take a look, discovering the Mountain Beast Warrior already turning around and heading back to its camp. Thereupon, Shi Feng let out a breath of relief. If it had continued chasing, Shi Feng\u2019s Windwalk would have timed out.His luck was truly rotten. There was actually a Special Elite inside the campsite. In his previous life, there were no monster camps that were guarded by a Special Elite. There would only be the occasional normal Elite monster. Shi Feng felt unfortunate for losing the Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chest.Currently, Blackie\u2019s communication arrived.\u201cBrother Feng, all of our members have reached Level 4. Moreover, we obtained a lot of ore, equipment, and skill books. Everyone has learned quite a few skills, and our strength has greatly increased. Unfortunately, our leveling speed from grinding Gnomes has greatly decreased. When will you be coming over to carry us through the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest? Our fighting spirits are all sky-high right now, and we\u2019re just waiting for your command,\u201d Blackie laughingly said.\u201cAll of you are Level 4?\u201d Shi Feng entered a deep thought, trying to think of the next task for Blackie and the others to do. After some thought, Shi Feng thought of a good location, \u201cBlackie, you guys should stop grinding Gnomes and return to town to tidy up your bags. Go to the Level 5 area, the Red Leaf Forest. Follow this marker and grind Forest Wolves. The Wolf Meat and Wolf Skins are good stuff. The more you grind, the better, as all the drops can be sold, fattening your wallets.\u201dWith Blackie and the others\u2019 current potential, it would be very easy to grind Forest Wolves. This was especially true with Blackie\u2019s equipment. The monster\u2019s 400 HP would be gone with just three Dark Arrows. Moreover, the location Shi Feng gave to Blackie was a large Wolf Den. The respawn rate there was very quick, and there was also higher ground for Blackie and the others to occupy. As long as Cola and Lonely Snow firmly block the pathway up the slope, preventing even a single wolf from moving past them, the ranged members could easily deal damage. Moreover, Beasts[1] were afraid of fire, taking additional damage from it. A single Hell Flame could wipe out the entire pack of wolves. Their leveling speed would increase by at least 60% to 70%.\u201cGreat! We\u2019re bored out of our minds from constantly grinding Gnomes. We\u2019ll go immediately after we tidy up our bags,\u201d Blackie excitedly confirmed. More and more players started going to their location to grind Gnomes now. In addition to them being Level 4, their leveling efficiency was constantly decreasing. They were naturally excited to have a new location to grind.\u201cBrothers, pack up! We won\u2019t have to compete with them anymore. Let\u2019s go play in a new location,\u201d Blackie said to the others after cutting off the call.Everyone stopped fighting over monsters with the other players when they heard Blackie say so. They cheerfully left this place with Blackie.When the Elite parties saw Blackie and the others leaving, their faces revealed expressions of joy. There would be fewer people competing over this precious leveling ground now. They inwardly sneered at the foolishness of Blackie\u2019s party. Currently, players filled the entirety of Dark Moon Valley. How could the leveling speed at the other locations be faster than here?Elsewhere, just when Shi Feng was ready to look for other Mountain Beast Fighters, he noticed a problem from the conversation with Blackie.It was definitely not possible for him to kill the Mountain Beast Warrior by himself, but he could still escape. However, it was not necessary for him to kill the Mountain Beast Warrior to obtain the Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chest.As long as one person lured the Mountain Beast Warrior, another person could go and open the Treasure Chest.Thinking up to this point, Shi Feng looked at the Abyssal Blade with a faint smile.As expected, Phantom Kill was a very powerful skill.Following which, Shi Feng once more returned to the Mountain Beast camp. He activated Phantom Kill, his doppelganger appearing before him.The doppelganger possessed all of Shi Feng\u2019s skills. It was sufficient to hold off the Mountain Beast Warrior for more than twenty seconds. With these twenty seconds, Shi Feng could activate the Treasure Chest and take away all the items.Shi Feng took out a Speed Scroll and Polymorph Scroll, giving them to the doppelganger. The Polymorph Scroll could polymorph monsters below Level 15 into a sheep for 4 seconds. However, the effective duration on a Special Elite would be greatly decreased. Although, it was enough as long as it could disrupt the Mountain Beast Warrior\u2019s Charge.After activating the Speed Scroll, the doppelganger immediately went to the storehouse to lure the Mountain Beast Warrior.As expected, the scene from before replayed itself, and the doppelganger used Parry to block the flying death ax. It subsequently used Charge at the doppelganger. The doppelganger immediately used the Polymorph Scroll, instantly turning the Mountain Beast Warrior into a little white sheep.The Mountain Beast Warrior reverted to its original form in less than a second. It then chased after the doppelganger, entering deep into the stone forest. The Mountain Beast Warrior\u2019s speed was slightly faster than the doppelganger, but the doppelganger activated Windwalk, its speed and the distance between them increasing once more.A short distance away, Shi Feng watched as the Mountain Beast Warrior departed from the campsite. He let out a small chuckle, similarly activating Windwalk as he rushed into the storehouse.This time, there were no monsters present to interrupt him when he entered the storehouse. Shi Feng first went up to the Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chest, opening it.The Treasure Chest needed time to be opened.1 second\u2026 2 seconds\u2026The loading bar for the Treasure Chest was still going, causing Shi Feng to become slightly nervous. The time his doppelganger could delay was limited. Aside from the Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chest, there was still one more Bronze Treasure Chest and three Common Treasure Chests. Time was of the essence. As long as he opened a Treasure Chest now, it would not be possible to lure the tiger out of the mountain the next time around. After all, Special Elites possessed their own intelligence.\u201cHurry, hurry\u2026\u201d Shi Feng impatiently looked at the loading bar.Ten seconds later, the Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chest opened.At the same time, a wrathful roar came from the stone forest. It would seem that Shi Feng\u2019s actions had been discovered.Looking through the doppelganger\u2019s vision, Shi Feng could see that the Mountain Beast Warrior no longer paid the doppelganger any attention. Instead, it ran back towards the camp\u2019s storehouse.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWithout pause, Shi Feng immediately stored all the items in the Treasure Chest into his bag. He then continued to open the Bronze Chest.The Bronze Treasure Chest\u2019s loading bar started to move slowly. To Shi Feng, every second right now was crawling by.Meanwhile, the sound of the Mountain Beast Warrior\u2019s bellow was getting closer and closer\u2026TL Notes:[1] Beasts : A general category for monsters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hearing the roar getting closer and closer, Shi Feng became extremely anxious.\u201cHurry\u2026 Hurry\u2026\u201dThe Mountain Beast Warrior had already entered the camp, yet the loading bar was still a hair\u2019s breadth away from full.When the Mountain Beast Warrior saw Shi Feng opening the Treasure Chest, its large pair of eyes turned crimson red. It aimed its giant ax at Shi Feng, throwing it at him. It could not help but wish for Shi Feng to go to hell immediately.At this moment, the Bronze Treasure Chest opened.Without giving the flying ax even a single glance, Shi Feng immediately activated Defensive Blade, blocking the attack from the flying death ax. Following which, his two hands swiftly stretched into the Treasure Chest, taking the items within and cramping them into his bag with lightning speed.When Shi Feng finished storing all of the items from the Treasure Chest, the Mountain Beast Warrior also arrived before him. It picked up the fallen ax with both of its hands, raising it up high as it prepared to murder.Having no plans to stay, Shi Feng turned and ran.Boom!The earth split when the ax landed, leaving behind a scar and causing crushed stones to go flying. However, Shi Feng was already five yards away by the time the ax landed. He was running directly to the outside of the camp.Seeing that its attack missed, the Mountain Beast Warrior turned to face Shi Feng and used Charge. It did not intend to give Shi Feng any chance to escape.On the other hand, Shi Feng did not have any skills to deal with the Mountain Beast Warrior who was charging at him. He allowed the Mountain Beast Warrior to send him into a Fainted state, his body then receiving a slash from its ax. In an instant, the attack sent him flying over ten yards away.The attack from the Mountain Beast Warrior could cause even a Level 5 Shield Warrior to harbor a grudge, yet Shi Feng acted as if it was nobody\u2019s business as he stood and started running out of the camp once more. Now, Defensive Blade could only prevent Shi Feng from receiving damage from a melee attack one more time.Although only one chance remained, there was more than a 10-yard distance between Shi Feng and the Mountain Beast Warrior. As long as Shi Feng ran into the stone forest, he would be a lot safer.However, an unexpected situation occurred. The Mountain Beast Warrior that should have used Charge only once used it a second time, sending Shi Feng into a Fainted state once more. It raised its giant ax, slashing it again at Shi Feng\u2019s body.Shi Feng was sent flying for over ten yards again; this time it immediately threw him out of the camp. He was just a short distance away from the stone forest now.However, Shi Feng\u2019s expression became much more serious. The current Mountain Beast Warrior was completely different from before. Previously, it only used Charge once. Now, it used Charge twice. That meant that there was a possibility for a third or fourth Charge, maybe even more. That meant, as long as the distance between Shi Feng and the Mountain Beast Warrior exceeded eight yards, the Mountain Beast Warrior would use Charge. This was definitely not good news.Just as expected, the moment Shi Feng stepped out of the 8-yard range, the Mountain Beast Warrior used Charge once again. If Shi Feng were to be hit once more, he would definitely die.He was not willing to die just yet.Shi Feng took out a Polymorph Scroll, immediately turning the Mountain Beast Warrior that was charging at him into a sheep. Although it was polymorphed only for a second, just one second was enough for Shi Feng to run a long distance away. As long as Shi Feng could run out of the 30-yard range, it would be too far for the Mountain Beast Warrior to use Charge.Just after running 15 yards away, the Mountain Beast Warrior recovered. Shi Feng immediately spun around and cast Abyssal Bind. He then activated Gravity Liberation, his speed soaring greatly.The three seconds binding this time allowed Shi Feng to easily run past the 30-yard range, entering the stone forest.Currently, some of the Mountain Beast Fighters in the stone forest had already respawned, and by coincidence, one of them was blocking the path ahead of Shi Feng. Being struck by inspiration, Shi Feng quickly took the initiative.Wind Blade!Before the Mountain Beast Fighter could react, Shi Feng rushed to its front and brushed past it. Shi Feng then took out another Polymorph Scroll, turning the Mountain Beast Fighter into a sheep.With the speed increase from Wind Blade, Shi Feng easily shook off the Mountain Beast Warrior that was stubbornly chasing after him, escaping it quickly.After finding a safe location, Shi Feng sat down to rest as he slowly looked through the items his bag.Shi Feng went from clueless to shocked.He had to admit that ransacking the camp was extremely profitable. Just this one time was enough to make up for his hours of hard work. He instantly collected all of the Moonstone he needed, completing his Quest. The next thing he needed to do was to leave the Moonlight Forest and dispel the curse.Amongst these treasures, aside from the large amount of Moonstone, there were also seven Tier 1 Gemstones, three pieces of Bronze Equipment, and a single bronze-colored Mysterious-Iron Ring.Amongst the three pieces of Bronze Equipment, there was a Silvermoon Armguard. With it, Shi Feng now had three out of five pieces of the Silvermoon Set Equipment. As long as he put in more effort, he might be able to truly collect a complete set. However, Shi Feng did not have that much time. The earlier he removed the curse, the earlier he could regain his strength and level up quickly. He still had too many things to do, and he could not do any of them without Levels.Aside from the Silvermoon Armguard attracting Shi Feng\u2019s attention, the Mysterious-Iron Ring also gave him tremendous joy.[Ring of Nothingness] (Mysterious-Iron ranked Ring)Equipment Requirement: Intelligence 10Strength +1, Agility +1, Intelligence +2Additional Ability: Shadow of Nothingness: Allows the user to enter a state of nothingness. The user will not be able to see other players, while other players will not be able to see the user. Duration of 1 minute.Cooldown: 5 minutes(Only usable in a non-combative state)Rings such as this, which possessed an Additional Ability, were extremely rare. It was as rare as the Ring of Gravity, possessing many uses.In his previous life, Shi Feng had done a lot of research on the Moonlight Forest. Including the information found on the internet, he knew the spawn locations of many Treasure Chests. Originally, he planned to only go to a few locations that were easy to obtain Treasure Chests before leaving the Moonlight Forest. Now that he had the Ring of Nothingness, his train of thought widened, and the number of Treasure Chests that he could obtain greatly increased.The Moonlight Forest was still a virgin land, and treasures could be found everywhere. It was especially true for Treasure Chests that had been opened for the first time; the items inside were the best. Since he could easily obtain these treasures, would it matter if he wasted a little more time?Following which, Shi Feng put on the Ring of Nothingness. He then opened the map for the Moonlight Forest, confirming his current position.There was a Bronze Treasure Chest not far from his location. So, he kept the map and advanced towards the Treasure Chest.After walking for over ten minutes, he arrived at ruins of a shrine. The ruins were surrounded by Barbaric Beastmen who were guarding it, with several Elite Beastmen in the midst as well. Meanwhile, the Treasure Chest was located inside the collapsed shrine. However, without a team of twenty elite players, it was impossible to clear off all the Barbaric Beastmen.Although he could not beat the Barbaric Beastmen, Shi Feng had other methods to get to the Treasure Chest.Shi Feng immediately called out his doppelganger, allowing it to move to a distance away and find a safe location. Meanwhile, Shi Feng himself moved closer to the temple. While staying outside the detection range of the Barbaric Beastmen, Shi Feng activated Shadow of Nothingness and entered a state of nothingness. He then ran towards the inside of the shrine with high speed.After entering a state of nothingness, Shi Feng could no longer see those Barbaric Beastmen, and the same went for the Barbaric Beastmen who could no longer see Shi Feng. In such a way, Shi Feng soundlessly entered the heavily guarded shrine.There were still several Barbaric Beastmen guarding inside the shrine. They were less than twenty yards away from the Bronze Treasure Chest.Meanwhile, Shi Feng unhurriedly opened the Treasure Chest.When opening the Treasure Chest, Shi Feng\u2019s state of nothingness did not fade, so the channeling process finished without a hitch.However, the moment the Treasure Chest was opened, just after Shi Feng\u2019s hand stretched into it, his state of nothingness vanished.Within an instant, the five Barbaric Beastmen inside the temple noticed Shi Feng. Suddenly entering a rage, they waved their stone hammers as they rushed towards him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Feng activated Defensive Blade without hurry, storing the items in the Treasure Chest in his bag. Before the Barbaric Beastmen could break off the three layers of protection, Shi Feng had taken all the items from the Treasure Chest. He then swapped places with his doppelganger, his original body arriving at a very safe location. Shi Feng leisurely departed from the ruins, heading towards the location of the next Treasure Chest.Moonlight Forest was very large. With unyielding perseverance, Shi Feng spent more than ten hours before finally clearing the entirety of the Moonlight Forest. He harvested a total of three Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chests, twenty-two Bronze Treasure Chests, and fifty-six Common Treasure Chests. His harvest was extremely invigorating. His entire bag was clogged full, and he was even forced to throw away several pieces of Common Equipment that had poor Attributes.When he was arranging all these items, a beeping noise came from the System.Shi Feng looked at the notification, seeing that it was the alarm that he previously set. It notified him that morning had arrived, and he needed to log off and rest.In consideration of his body, Shi Feng looked for a safe location before logging off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68 \u2013 Big HarvestEarly morning, a layer of fog still covered the outer layer of the window. Dark clouds densely covered the sky outside, and there were signs of rain falling soon.\u201cHmm\u2026 the air quality here is getting worse by the day\u2026 After I earn enough money, I definitely have to move out of this broken district and move to a better house in the city.\u201dAfter sitting up, Shi Feng took a look out his window. Following which, he flexed his body and got down from his bed. He then went through twenty sets of workout motions before going to his cramped bathroom to wash up.Shi Feng grabbed his phone from the table once he finished tidying himself up. He started by checking the remaining money in his bank account. Constantly eating instant noodles was bad for his body. Moreover, the nutrients provided were definitely not enough to supplement his method of training.He had obtained the membership card and coupons for Big Dipper after much difficulty, yet, he discovered that he still needed to wait for five days before he could use them. This caused him to be slightly depressed. Now, his only hope was on the sales of the God\u2019s Domain game currency.Previously, Shi Feng had registered 3 Gold Coins at the Virtual Trade Center. If there were someone who bought them, then the Credits earned would automatically be sent to his bank account. However, the Trade Center had a 3-hour transaction delay. Moreover, Shi Feng did not turn on the notifications for his trade account. So, even if the transaction had already been done, he did not know how much had been transferred to his account. He could only use his old-modeled phone to check his bank account.Shi Feng currently did not possess the money to purchase the latest quantum watch[1]. Otherwise, a lot of matters could be easily resolved using the quantum watch. Even credit card payments could be done through the quantum watch. Moreover, all shops that sold items supported payment using the quantum watch, as it was both safe and fast.In a short moment, Shi Feng logged into his bank account using his handphone, checking the amount of money he had remaining. If there were enough Credits, he would go and have a good meal. The last time he remembered having meat was when he was still in his third year of university. Now, he was in his fourth year and would be graduating soon.Previously, he had retrieved all of his money from his bank account to buy instant noodles. His current balance should not be more than 1 Credit.After selling for an entire night, there should be some people who would purchase some of his game currency. It was especially true for the Guilds in White River City. Shi Feng did not believe those Guilds could amass funds that quickly. Even if they were to sign a contract with money-farming teams or have their money-farming teams, it was absolutely impossible for them to purchase that much equipment in such a short period. More or less, they should have purchased some game currency.\u201cThey actually bought quite a lot. I guess I won\u2019t have to fuss over food for a few days,\u201d Shi Feng smiled slightly when he saw that there were over 1,700 Credits in his bank account. However, the trade tax was truly high. He sold a total of 30 Silver Coins which were worth 1,800 Credits, but 100 of those Credits went to taxes. The amount was truly sinister.In any case, Shi Feng now had some money, and it was double the amount of living expenses he would have each month. It was enough for him to eat properly for quite some time.If all 3 Gold Coins sold, then that would amount to 18,000 Credits. Shi Feng would then have the money to buy two Virtual Gaming Helmets. The only worry he had right now was whether or not all 3 Gold Coins would sell.After some consideration, Shi Feng decided that he definitely must make these Guilds and players spend more money during this period. Otherwise, if they were to make business deals in the game, they would easily be able to solve their problem with money. At that time, they would not have to purchase game currency from the Virtual Trade Center.Subsequently, Shi Feng left his rented apartment. He made a trip to the bank, withdrawing all of his money.Now that he had some money, Shi Feng went to the Nutrition Center and bought three bottles of C-rank Nutrient Fluids. They were enough to last him for up to nine days.When the beautiful saleswoman saw that Shi Feng had bought three bottles without even blinking, she could not help but have delightful thoughts. Taking the initiative, she asked, \u201cAre you free this afternoon, handsome? How about we go to Youlan Square to have a drink? My treat.\u201dYoulan Square was a nearby well-known romantic location, and many youths, both males and females, loved going there.Looking at the beautiful saleswoman\u2019s graceful body and lust-filled eyes, she was much better than the gorgeously dressed girls in his class. However, Shi Feng only gave her a calm smile. How could he not know what her thoughts were? He tactfully rejected her and turned around to leave.Shi Feng\u2019s reaction caused the beautiful saleswoman to feel slightly unfortunate. A large catch had run away just like that. Was she not beautiful? Was her body lacking?Nutrient Fluids were the pinnacle products of the new age. Not only could they slow down aging, but they could also discretely mend the injuries that could not be detected, regenerate body cells, develop the brain cells, and many more astonishing impacts. These items have already become must-haves for athletes and martial artists. However, they were very expensive, so the common folk could only occasionally buy a bottle to drink. After all, a month\u2019s salary was only so much. It was impossible for them to afford a bottle every three days. Only the wealthy were able to treat these Nutrient Fluids as drinks, constantly transforming their bodies.Hundreds of years ago, very rarely would the children of wealthy families be ugly. Females would normally be beauties, while males would normally be handsome men. However, with the Nutrient Fluids in this current age, beautiful women and handsome men could be commonly seen throughout the streets.A bottle of C-rank Nutrient Fluid cost 400 Credits.A bottle of B-rank Nutrient Fluid cost 1,000 Credits.A bottle of A-rank Nutrient Fluid cost 10,000 Credits.As for the best S-rank Nutrient Fluids, those were items that could not be bought by common folk even if they wanted to. These Nutrient Fluids were only sold to the inner circles of society.In his previous life, Shi Feng was fortunate enough to buy one because of his status as a core member of Shadow. The S-rank Nutrient Fluid was extremely expensive, costing a million Credits per bottle. However, its effects were similarly astonishing. A-rank Nutrient Fluids were far from being comparable to it.Although S-rank Nutrient Fluids were very expensive, there were plenty of wealthy people in the world. The ones who could afford to buy it would not trouble themselves over such an amount of money. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want to trade money for their own youth?It was truly hard to imagine; the dream of humanity hundreds of years ago had now become a reality.The body was a needed asset to make a revolution. If Shi Feng wanted to improve his skills in God\u2019s Domain and stand at the very top of the game, then a strong body and nimble mind were indispensable. Hence, Shi Feng would not make the same mistake in this aspect as he did in his previous life.Following which, Shi Feng went to a gourmet restaurant. He spent a hundred Credits purchasing two sets of nutrient set meals; one was for him to eat right now and another as takeaway for his lunch.After eating, Shi Feng made a trip to a normal workout center. After spending 60 Credits, he trained for four hours before returning home.In the evening, around 7 p.m., Shi Feng drank a bottle of Nutrient Fluid and laid on the bed. He activated the gaming helmet and connected to God\u2019s Domain.After logging in, Shi Feng started arranging the items he obtained.When he was done arranging the items, Shi Feng started feeling emotional. It was no wonder the Moonlight Forest was a land of treasures. Just the various Tier 1 Gemstones he obtained alone amounted to over 300 pieces. There were also tens of skill books, dozens of pieces of Bronze Equipment, five pieces of Mysterious-Iron Equipment, over fifty Card Sets, more than twenty recipes for Lifestyle Jobs, over thirty Tier 1 Magic Scrolls, and four Tier 2 Magic Scrolls.The Magic Scrolls from Treasure Chests were much better than those sold in the Magic Shop. This was because the various scrolls in the Magic Shop did not even reach the standard of Tier 1. Meanwhile, Tier 2 Magic Scrolls were much more precious. Every piece would have a great purpose, and there would be nobody willing to sell it.As for the thing that brought Shi Feng the most joy\u2026He finished collecting the Silvermoon Set Equipment. In addition, he also collected a complete set of Blackblood Set Equipment meant for Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Blackblood Set Equipment\u2019s value far exceeded that of the Silvermoon Set Equipment. It was one of the best Set Equipment for Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights that were below Level 10. If Cola were to equip this set at Level 6 or Level 7, then Hell Mode Dungeons below Level 10 would no longer be a problem.With so many good items, Shi Feng already had a solid base for forming a twenty-man team. The only concerns remaining would be recruiting members and their skills.After finished arranging his bag and confirming that there were no more profits to be gained from the Moonlight Forest, Shi Feng activated the Teleportation Magic Orb, leaving the Moonlight Forest.TL Notes:[1]quantum watch: something like a wristwatch version of a quantum computer\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69 \u2013 LunaticIn the real world, the sky slowly darkened as the sun went under the mountain. On the other hand, players in God\u2019s Domain were welcoming the rise of the morning sun.Red Leaf Town was currently brightly lit as if it were daytime. In the Trade Area, players could be found everywhere as they pushed their way through the streets. Compared to yesterday, there were a lot more players currently in Red Leaf Town, and a lot of them were new players who were Level 0.After being officially active for two days, many people started to notice the difference between God\u2019s Domain and other virtual reality games. The battling alone was extremely attractive, not to mention other sources of entertainment. The monsters in God\u2019s Domain improved with the increase in Levels, making the battles seem increasingly real. It was no longer the usual simple bouts where players and monsters would take turns fighting each other. The battles in God\u2019s Domain were more similar to the fighting competitions in real life.This was the age where the world\u2019s entire population would exercise. In the real world, people had already reached a level of obsession in regards to fighting competitions, making such competitions extremely popular.Everyone wished for a battle in which they could fight to their heart\u2019s content, and even more so when exchanging blows with an expert. They wanted to chase after the intense feeling of excitement that made one\u2019s blood boil. It was an addicting feeling that was impossible to give up. Meanwhile, God\u2019s Domain had all of this, and there were no dangers to a person\u2019s life.Moreover, God\u2019s Domain contained great adventures that were both fascinating and thrilling. There were also countless unknowns waiting to be discovered and explored. Time in the game was also double that of real life. Many players wished they could stay inside God\u2019s Domain for the rest of their lives, living their second life within the game.It was also because of this reason that many players were attracted to God\u2019s Domain. Many virtual gaming companies, after seeing this irreversible situation, declared bankruptcy, one after another, as they prepared to invest in God\u2019s Domain. Such a situation also caused some unwilling veteran gamers to enter God\u2019s Domain, greatly increasing the number of players.Just after returning to Red Leaf Town, Shi Feng received a bunch of System Notifications.Almost all of them were sales notifications from the Auction House. Within an instant, the money Shi Feng possessed increased to over 500 Silver Coins or 5 Gold Coins.Shi Feng still remembered having recently registering 3 Gold Coins at the Virtual Trade Center. After less than a day\u2019s worth of effort, he now possessed an additional 5 Gold Coins. Those Guilds obtained all this money after much difficulty, yet, they all contributed to him in the end.Currently, there might not be another player in White River City who was wealthier than he was. The Guild Leaders of first-rate Guilds were no exception.However, this was only the tip of the iceberg. The real moneymaking moment was just starting.Shi Feng first stored all the items that were in his bag into his warehouse. He was not planning on selling them but instead, kept them for future use. After all, items such as Gemstones and skill books were hard currencies[a]; their prices would never depreciate. On the contrary, it was equipment that would depreciate along with the increase in player levels.Soon afterward, Shi Feng started doing his old business again. Nighttime was the best period for doing business. Seeing that the sun was soon to rise, Shi Feng set aside his Quest for now and set up a street stall, purchasing Stones, Magic Essences, Hard Stones, and Card Sets.Due to previous similar occurrences, many players would deliberately stay here and await Shi Feng\u2019s arrival. Now, just a casual shout from Shi Feng was enough to cause a crowd of players to come running towards him.In such a way, Shi Feng bought materials while listening to the conversations of players nearby.\u201cThe Assassin\u2019s Alliance has obtained great glory this time. They completed the Insurrection of the Little Fishmen Quest and earned a lot of Guild Reputation. It won\u2019t be long before the Assassin\u2019s Alliance will become a Level 2 Guild.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? I\u2019ve heard that a major event occurred in the capital city. The Guild Leader of a first-rate Guild, Star River Federation, completed a major Quest and has already become a First Class Citizen. Just a little more and he will become part of the nobility. When he obtains the status of a noble, what would a little Guild Reputation matter? After becoming a noble, he could go to the Army Camp and City Hall to ask for Guild Quests. Star River Federation could catch up and surpass the Assassin\u2019s Alliance at any time. Including the various privileges available to nobles, their accumulated advantage is huge. Just the current Star River Federation was enough to suppress Ouroboros. When the fight for the capital city begins, the city would most likely fall into the hands of the Star River Federation.\u201d\u201cThose are just small matters. Now, the most popular matter would have to be the showdown between that Black Flame Forger and Hammer Trading.\u201d\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know about that? Right now, there is most likely not a single person in the White River City Area that doesn\u2019t know of it. However, I never truly imagined that the victor would be so quickly determined. Even further, I never thought that the final winner would be Hammer Trading. Hehe, thankfully I was quick-witted and borrowed some money to buy a Glimmer Chestplate. Many people are currently buying them at high prices. I could easily earn 3 Silver Coins as long as I resell the one I have.\u201d\u201cExactly! Regardless of Attributes or design, the Glimmer Chestplate is way better, so its cost must be extremely high. It only sold for such a low price because of the competition with Hammer Trading. Black Flame must have lost that battle after constantly losing money. Unfortunately, he is not selling even a single piece of the equipment right now. Otherwise, I would definitely borrow money to buy one. Right now, Hammer Trading\u2019s fame has exploded. On the forums, he had even started proudly scolding the mysterious forger as incompetent, calling the mysterious forger a son of a bitch for not daring to compete with him. To increase their fame and influence, those first-rate Guilds will certainly invite him. Hammer Trading must already be discussing contract terms with them right now.\u201d\u201cThe Chief Forger of a first-rate Guild, people would drool just thinking about such a position. However, we can only look on in envy because we don\u2019t have a Forging Design for Bronze Equipment. If I had such an item, even if I were to go bankrupt, I would definitely compete with Hammer Trading to the end. When I get the Chief position of a first-rate Guild, my future will be filled with fame and fortune.\u201dWhen Shi Feng heard their conversation, his brows slightly wrinkled. He then called up the official forum.Sure enough, Hammer Trading was ridiculing him with all sorts of insults.Son of a bitch, weren\u2019t you so awesome? Why have you turned into a coward? Let\u2019s continue competing if you have the ability! See how I\u2019ll flatten a blackhearted forger like you!Looking at Hammer Trading\u2019s inferior shenanigans, Shi Feng smiled calmly. He could not help but admire Hammer Trading. To become famous, he turned into a lunatic that was willing to use any means. Just like in Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, to join World Dominators and become their Chief Forger, Hammer Trading was willing to sell out their entire Guild.After he finished purchasing the materials, Shi Feng headed towards the Auction House.After all the clamor Hammer Trading made, the Glimmer Chestplate had thoroughly become famous. Shi Feng could now start his next moneymaking operation.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the current stage of the game, a majority of the average players were already Level 3, while many veterans were Level 4 and experts were Level 5. The average player could not afford a Glimmer Chestplate. Whereas veterans would have to borrow some money to purchase a piece for themselves. As for experts, the usage of the Glimmer Chestplate was not that great. There was a lot of equipment inside Level 5 Dungeons that was far better than the Glimmer Chestplate.That meant that the Glimmer Chestplate could no longer earn Shi Feng a lot of money. After all, the major buyers of the equipment were mostly those Guilds. Maybe there were some nouveau riche who could afford to buy one to toy around with, but they were in the extreme minorities amongst the average players.Shi Feng walked into the Auction House, into the large hall that was packed with people. Without a better option, Shi Feng looked for a corner and silently brought up the display screen of the Auction House. He then placed twenty copies of the Forging Design for the Glimmer Chestplate on auction. The base price for each Forging Design was set at 30 Silver Coins, and they would be sold one by one at intervals of half an hour.It was not because Shi Feng did not wish to sell them in bulk, but because doing so would result in their price staying low. Only through hunger marketing would he be able to reap the greatest profit. Let those Guilds slowly fight amongst themselves.Afterwards, Shi Feng cleaned out the accumulated Hard Stones and Card Sets from the Auction House. He then left the Auction House and headed towards the Library.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this stage of the game, there were very few players who would come here to grind and level up.That was because the level here was slightly higher. Moreover, the monsters were numerous and concentrated, making them hard to kill.These Grassland Lion Cubs hunted in groups of three to five. Sometimes, they would even be followed by a fully grown Elite Grassland Lion, making them very hard to deal with.However, there was currently a six-man party on these fields, fighting a group of lions. A girl dressed in water-blue armor brandished her greatsword, directly confronting an Elite Grassland Lion. Not only did she easily evade the Grassland Lion\u2019s sharp claws, she even took the chance to attack and deal damage. Her valiant appearance could captivate even women.This girl was the Snow Goddess, Gentle Snow. She had already reached Level 5, and she wore the Level 4 Bronze Set Equipment, Azure Scar. In her hands, she held the Mysterious-Iron ranked Conqueror\u2019s Sword. Compared to before, her current strength had greatly increased.Also, there was also a Shield Warrior who was not any weaker, tanking four Grassland Lion Cubs at once. The party\u2019s healer, Xiao Yue\u2019er, chanted a prayer, her delicate hands tracing divine texts in midair. Xiao Yue\u2019er took care of the Shield Warrior while also healing Gentle Snow, allowing both their HPs to remain above the safety line.The Flame Witch, Zhao Yueru, was also wearing the Level 4 Fantasy Flame Set Equipment. Large Fireballs constantly shot out from her hand, causing a frightening amount of damage to appear above the Grassland Lion\u2019s head.Within moments, they massacred the group of Elite-led lions.Gentle Snow picked up the loot from the Grassland Lion, discovering that it was a skill book. No equipment dropped. She then looked towards Xiao Yue\u2019er, saying, \u201cXiao Yue\u2019er, it\u2019s your Sacred Light Shield; learn it quickly. After some rest, we will continue looking for another Grassland Lion. We absolutely must get the Revival skill.\u201d\u201cGreat! With this skill, healing won\u2019t be so intense anymore,\u201d Xiao Yue\u2019er happily said as she received the skill.Currently resting, Zhao Yueru suddenly asked in a curious tone, \u201cSnow, that Hammer Trading has already garnered a huge amount of fame. We should at least send a person to recruit him. We can still increase our Guild\u2019s fame if we\u2019re successful. Moreover, his forging skills are not bad. It would be unfortunate if we were to let some other Guild snatch him away.\u201d\u201cNo need. It won\u2019t be long before Level 3 Bronze Equipment is of little value. He only knows how to forge Level 3 Bronze Equipment and doesn\u2019t possess any Forging Designs for higher level equipment. Why should we spend a large sum of money fighting over him? We would just lose out on earning a little money. Moreover, we don\u2019t even know when our Guild would be able to obtain a Forging Design for high-leveled Bronze Equipment. What would we need him for?\u201d Gentle Snow shook her head. She held no particular interests towards a person like Hammer Trading. Instead, she said, \u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019m more interested in the Black Flame Forger, especially the forger\u2019s actions. I can not see through his intentions.\u201cIf he wanted to attract the attention of first-rate Guilds and stand out, then he has no reason to hide his name. There would be plenty of large Guilds contacting him. However, he has hidden his name, preventing anybody from contacting him. That means that he does not wish for others to know of his identity. Yet, he still competed with Hammer Trading, lowering the price for his equipment and letting everyone know of him once more. Now that he has entered our eyes, at the most heated moment, he suddenly withdraws from the competition and fades out of our sight once more.\u201cHe has continuously brought us three different kinds of forged equipment. Being able to obtain that many Forging Designs for Bronze Equipment shows that he has great strength. Yet, why would he suddenly withdraw? What is this Black Flame Forger\u2019s goal? Or did he withdraw because he already achieved his goal?\u201cUntil now, I still don\u2019t know what that Black Flame Forger is trying to do. He is filled with mystery in all aspects.\u201d\u201cSnow, how about I have someone research this forger? Hearing you say so, even I want to see what kind of person he is.\u201dAfter hearing Gentle Snow\u2019s analysis, realization struck Zhao Yueru. She suddenly grew an interest towards this Black Flame Forger. She also felt this person was not simple. Her interest towards the Black Flame Forger\u2019s identity overflowed. Just the thought of being able to expose this person\u2019s identity made her feel slightly excited.Meanwhile, inside an Intermediate Forging Room on the second floor of the Forging Association\u2026\u201cEveryone, how goes your consideration?\u201d Hammer Trading sat cross-legged, casually asking as he looked at the representatives of the first-rate Guilds with narrowed eyes.However, the conditions set out by Hammer Trading caused these first-rate Guilds to go silent.Hammer Trading\u2019s conditions were too harsh. Just the villa he wanted in the city he lived in and the annual salary of five million Credits would cause these Guilds to take a step back, not to mention that he wanted all resources to be prioritized to him. Such treatment was most likely only enjoyed by the Guild Leader and the Vice Leader. Meanwhile, Hammer Trading wanted the same treatment as them. Then, didn\u2019t that mean he would be on equal footings with the Guild Leader and Vice Leader?\u201cYou guys have to think through this clearly. It isn\u2019t easy for me to earn such a great reputation. As long as I join your Guild, your popularity will immediately soar and surpass the other Guilds. You won\u2019t have a shortage of Bronze Equipment and will be able to earn a large sum of money because of my forging techniques. The price I\u2019ve given shouldn\u2019t be considered much,\u201d Hammer Trading said with a smile. His face held an expression that said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t recruit me, there will be others who will. Don\u2019t regret it when that time comes.\u201dHammer Trading had these first-rate Guilds eating out of the palm of his hand. Right now, each of these first-rate Guilds wanted to be a step ahead of the others. If so, they would be able to have a larger advantage in taking hold of a City. The wealth that came with possessing control over a virtual City was not something a mere five million Credits and a villa could compare to. Hammer Trading\u2019s asking price could be considered low.Looking at the representatives of these first-rate Guilds, although their expressions held hesitation, their eyes flashed with the conviction of recruiting him. Hammer Trading suddenly felt his action of investing all of his possessions into the competition this time was truly wise. If he hadn\u2019t steeled his heart to borrow money from loan sharks at the last second, he might have actually lost to the Black Flame Forger. Fortunately, the Black Flame Forger bit the dust a step earlier than he did, allowing him to taste the final fruit of victory.Just as Hammer Trading was being pleased with himself, the expressions of the numerous representatives around the conference table suddenly changed. Each and every one of them revealed expressions of shock and ecstasy.\u201cBrother Hammer Trading, I am truly sorry, but our Guild has decided to withdraw from this competition and yield to the other Guilds. Our Guild won\u2019t be joining anymore, and I still have matters to attend to, so I\u2019ll be leaving,\u201d Star River Federation\u2019s representative suddenly said.\u201cThis price is just too high. Our Guild can only give up as well. We can only hope to cooperate with you in the future.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026For a moment, all the Guild representatives started leaving. Moreover, every one of them seemed to be in a hurry. It was as if they could not help but to immediately run to some other place, not wanting to waste even a little time.\u201cWhat do you all mean? Not negotiating anymore? You guys better not regret it. I\u2019m a Forger that can craft Bronze Equipment! I won\u2019t join in the future, even if you all beg me!\u201d\u201cIs being able to forge Bronze Equipment amazing? Right now, the Auction House is selling Forging Designs for Bronze Equipment. With the Forging Design, we can nurture our own forgers. We don\u2019t need to spend as much as five million Credits at all,\u201d one of the representatives coldly laughed at Hammer Trading before leaving the Forging Room.\u201cWhat did you say? Speak clearly before you leave!\u201d Hammer Trading abruptly stood up after hearing this. He thought he had heard wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71 \u2013 Focus of the Auction HouseSeeing as everyone had left, Hammer Trading sat in his chair, paralyzed. Both his eyes had a lifeless look in them.There was actually someone who was selling Forging Design for Bronze Equipment at the Auction House? How was this possible?Hammer Trading had no way of understanding such behavior. It was as foolish as literally handing the keys to a treasury filled with gold to someone else.Only a brain-dead person would do such an idiotic action.\u201cNo, they must be trying to trick me.\u201d Hammer Trading abruptly stood up, calling out the official forum. He wanted to make these people regret. He wanted to rip them off for daring to look down on him.However, when Hammer Trading looked at a few pinned discussion threads, he became instantly dumbfounded. There really was an idiot who was selling a Forging Design!Bronze Equipment Forging Design appearing in the Auction House! Pictures as evidence available!Clicking on the thread to take a look, Hammer Trading\u2019s mind went thoroughly blank.The Forging Design was actually for the Glimmer Chestplate. It was the equipment previously sold by the Black Flame Forger. Everyone was very aware of how good the Attributes on this item were. It was an absolutely top-tier item.If a first-rate Guild were to get ahold of this Forging Design, they would not need him.This was because fame served little purpose to a first-rate Guild. Previously, he dared to act presumptuously because he learned the Forging Design for the Savage Chestplate. Now that others had a better Forging Design, who would pay him any heed?In the discussion, many first-rate Guilds declared the Forging Design to be theirs, and they would fight whoever dared competed with them over it.Hence, everyone had started paying attention to the problem of the ownership of this Forging Design. There was no longer anybody who paid attention to Hammer Trading. Instead, each and every one of them was joyful over his misfortune, making fun of his end.This incident led everyone to admire the mysterious player who was selling the Forging Design. This mysterious player\u2019s means were extremely great, and people could not help but praise him. There was practically no blood seen when he killed. He only used a piece of paper to cause Hammer Trading, the rising star that received the envy and admiration of tens of thousands, to fall from his heavenly altar, tumbling down into the bottomless abyss and never being able to climb back up.Hammer Trading already bore a bitter hatred towards this player who sold the Forging Design. Just when his life of luxury was within his reach, it was all destroyed. Moreover, it was destroyed by a person who was brain-dead.Fear not a god-like rival, but fear a pig-like ally. Now, that saying needed an additional verse: and fear more a foolish passerby.Hammer Trading\u2019s eyes had currently turned crimson, his face extremely ashen. His expression alone was enough to devour a person.\u201cNot good. I definitely must buy it no matter the price. As long as I buy it, I can get back all the advantages. At that time, not only will I have the Savage Chestplate, but I will also have the Glimmer Chestplate. When that time comes, those first-rate Guilds will have to prostrate and beg before me.\u201d Hammer Trading\u2019s current expression was just like a gambler who lost badly. He placed all of his hopes on buying out the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design.Thinking up to this point, Hammer Trading was no longer able to hold himself back as he swiftly rushed towards the Auction House.However, it was not just Hammer Trading who was rushing towards the Auction House. There were also the upper echelons of various Guilds of various Towns under the influence of White River City. All of them wanted to purchase the Forging Design. After all, everyone knew how powerful the Glimmer Chestplate was. Owning the Forging Design was the equivalent of owning a mountain of gold.This incident caused an uproar at the Auction Houses of the various Towns in White River City. The Auction Houses became unusually lively as players pushed against one another inside the building. The Auction Houses were filled to the entrances, making it hard for players even to enter.Meanwhile, the competition for the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design entered into full swing. Every one of the Guilds had bid high prices. Within ten short minutes, the price for the item had reached 1 Gold Coin.That\u2019s right; it was 1 Gold Coin. That was practically a large Guild\u2019s entire fluid funds.In such a way, the price of the Forging Design constantly rose without any signs of stopping.\u201cGuild Leader, I don\u2019t have enough money anymore. What do we do now?\u201d\u201cCrap, how can that be? I gave you 1 Gold and 20 Silvers; how can that not be enough?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s selling at 1 Gold 56 Silvers now\u2026\u201d\u201cCrap, these people are insane. It\u2019s just a Forging Design. Hold on a bit; I\u2019ll immediately ask for some money from the money-farming team. I don\u2019t believe we can\u2019t get it.\u201dAs the price of the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design rose, bit by bit, each of the various Guilds was constantly raising funds. They contacted money-farming teams, their Guild members, and in the end, even purchased from the Virtual Trade Center.Meanwhile, Shi Feng, the cause of all this madness in White River City, had just comfortably arrived at the Library.\u201cRevered Miss Sharlyn, I have brought the items you requested. Can you dispel the curse for me now?\u201d Shi Feng sincerely took out 2 Gold Coins, 30 pieces of Moonstones, and the Teleportation Magic Orb.After seeing the glittering Gold Coins, Sharlyn nodded her head in satisfaction. However, similar to the Holy Mother, Sharlyn shook her head and said in a pitiful tone, \u201cAdventurer, you have truly astonished me. You managed to gather all the needed materials in such a short period. If I had known earlier, I would have told you that the Moon Drip ceremony possessed tiers.\u201d\u201cTiers?\u201d Shi Feng looked at Sharlyn\u2019s regretful expression, and he could not help but feel slightly odd about the situation. It was as if he was a mouse being stared at by a cat.\u201cMmhmm.\u201d Sharlyn sighed, saying, \u201cThe Moon Drip is a very ancient ceremony. In fact, aside from having a dispelling effect, there are still other effects. However, for convenience\u2019s sake, the ceremony was only used to dispel curses after constant alterations, while the other effects were greatly weakened. If you pay another 3 Gold Coins, I can gather all the needed materials to carry out the complete Moon Drip ceremony. Aside from helping you dispel the curse, it will also give you a unimaginably \u2018big harvest.\u2019 Won\u2019t you reconsider it?\u201d\u2018Big harvest,\u2019 when Sharlyn uttered these two words, her voice sounded exceptionally loud, making it sound as if this \u2018big harvest\u2019 was something amazing.However, Shi Feng knew that the Sharlyn before him had some kind of see-through skill. Otherwise, how could she have guessed that there were still 3 Gold Coins inside his bag? He already wasted 3 Gold Coins to dispel the curse, and he did not wish to become a sucker.As if having seen through Shi Feng\u2019s thoughts, Sharlyn added, \u201cAdventurer, do you know of the legend about the Demon Slaying Sword Saint, Celius? Legends has it that Celius was cursed by the Great Demon King, undergoing torment for a long period. However, after experiencing untold hardships, he finally discovered a method to dispel the curse, which was the Moon Drip. After undergoing the Moon Drip ceremony, he obtained a new life. He received matchless strength from the ceremony, thereby allowing him to defeat the Great Demon King and becoming a legendary Sword Saint on the continent of God\u2019s Domain. Don\u2019t you think the \u2018Sword Saint\u2019 Celius was very mighty?\u201dAs she was speaking, Sharlyn\u2019s doll-like eyes constantly snuck peeks at Shi Feng. She constantly let out lamented sighs at the mention of \u2018Sword Saint.\u2019\u201c\u2026\u201d Shi Feng suddenly became speechless.Watching Sharlyn\u2019s actions, it was clear they were saying, \u201cThe Sword Saint is beckoning at you. Youngster, won\u2019t you give it a go?\u201dShi Feng glanced at Sharlyn\u2019s face, full of smiles, and his heart filled with helplessness. This Sharlyn was a diamond salesperson!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAlthough Sharlyn possessed an unruly temperament and criminally attractive body, asking for 6 Gold Coins was just a huge scam! 6 Gold Coins! That was equivalent to 36,000 Credits!Very well. His heart was moved. If he could become a Sword Saint in the future, it would all be worth it.The new wouldn\u2019t come if the old didn\u2019t go.\u201cEsteemed Miss Sharlyn, I wish to try the complete Moon Drip ceremony. Will there be any danger?\u201d Shi Feng unwillingly dug out another 3 Gold Coins.After receiving the Gold Coins, Sharlyn happily smiled as she said, \u201cYou can be at ease, Adventurer. Although this is my first time, my skills are very good. Even my teacher praised me as a genius. Let us begin right away.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72 \u2013 Demon HunterThe sky was still dark as the moon lay unhidden, high up in the air.Inside the Library located in the Slums of Red Leaf Town\u2026\u201cAdventurer, if you do not have any problems, then walk to the center of the magic circle. There will be a slight pain after the ceremony starts, so just endure it, and it will be over,\u201d Sharlyn pointed towards the center of the altar made of black stone. Her eyes carried a hint of excitement as she could finally start this experiment.Shi Feng was completely unaware of Sharlyn\u2019s thoughts. He nodded his head as he walked into the magic circle.No matter how he put it, Sharlyn was a major character who possessed a Tier 3 Job, so there shouldn\u2019t be any complications. As for the pain he would have to suffer, he thought nothing of it.During battles inside God\u2019s Domain, a player could similarly feel pain when attacked by monsters. However, a majority of the players still chose to accept this kind of setting. Their goal was to increase the sense of realism, so they did not adjust the pain transmission to 0%. More importantly, they wanted to increase their skills in battle.There was an old saying of \u2018spare the rod and spoil the child.\u2019 Only with pain would one be able to remember the lesson, and only by learning the lesson, would one be able to further improve. Hence, if one wanted to grow in God\u2019s Domain, learning to accept such pain was a definite must.However, considering each player\u2019s tolerances, God\u2019s Domain set the pain transmission at 20% by default. However, some experts would adjust the transmission to 60%, allowing them to be more alert. Meanwhile, Shi Feng himself had adjusted it to 50%. This was the degree of pain he was accustomed to, and it was the amount at which he could best exhibit his strength.After standing in position, Shi Feng sent a nod towards Sharlyn, indicating that she could start the ceremony.Descent of the Moon Goddess!Sharlyn started her prayer; divine incantations left her mouth as her fingers traced out divine texts. Line after line of divine texts floated in midair and towards the horizon. Compared to the Tier 3 magic from before, the divine texts written in this ceremony were extremely numerous.Even after writing hundreds of lines, Sharlyn showed no signs of stopping. Sweat had already started dripping down Sharlyn\u2019s face, clearly indicating that she was somewhat exhausted. Meanwhile, the magic circle on the ground started to radiate a dazzling silver glow, the magic circle itself gradually rising into the air.After over ten minutes had passed, a streak of shining moonlight shot towards Shi Feng\u2019s body.Suddenly, dark smoke emerged from Shi Feng\u2019s body. The dark smoke was extremely reluctant to part from Shi Feng\u2019s body as it rose into the air. Meanwhile, sweat started appearing on Shi Feng\u2019s forehead. His face turned pale white as he endured an intense pain.Shi Feng nearly cursed at Sharlyn. This was definitely not at the level of just \u2018a slight pain,\u2019 but it was very, very painful. It was as if his limbs were being torn from his body.If he had not already played God\u2019s Domain for ten years, having long since become accustomed to pain, he might be wailing like a ghost and howling like a wolf right now.After persistently being lit by the moonlight for several minutes, the black smoke finally departed from Shi Feng\u2019s body. However, it did not just simply fade away. Instead, it formed into a dark shadow that was a carbon copy of Shi Feng.\u201cAdventurer, you need to kill this demon\u2019s doppelganger in order to dispel the curse. I have to conduct the ceremony, so I cannot lend you any aid. It is all up to you now,\u201d Sharlyn reminded.Somewhat exhausted, Shi Feng used Observing Eyes on this dark shadow.[Ye Feng (Demon\u2019s Doppelganger)] (Elite Rank)Level 4HP 2,000/2,000\u201cAn Elite?\u201d Shi Feng\u2019s complexion turned serious.The demon\u2019s doppelganger did not have a lot of HP, and its level was similar to his. If this doppelganger did not possess any powerful skills, then dealing with it would not be a huge problem. However, that probability was slim.\u201cWretched Moon Drip! Despicable human! Did you think that by using the complete Moon Drip to weaken my strength, you would be able to defeat me? I\u2019ll let you know the reason why lowly humans like you will never win against us powerful demons!\u201d The demon\u2019s doppelganger had an enraged expression as it pulled out a black longsword, slashing it at Shi Feng.In the blink of an eye, the doppelganger arrived before Shi Feng. A faint black ray followed as it waved its longsword. Within an instant, that single black ray turned into four streaks, all of them threatening to dice Shi Feng into blocks of meat.Extraordinary condition!Shi Feng was greatly shocked when seeing such an action. This speed far exceeded that of a normal Elite. Immediately, Shi Feng used Parry.Dang, Dang, Dang\u2026\u2026Shi Feng retreated several steps before he stabilized his body.If not for the complete Moon Drip, this demon\u2019s doppelganger might not have been just an Elite, but a Special Elite.\u201cDie!\u201d Despite having the upper hand, the demon\u2019s doppelganger did not give Shi Feng any chances. It used Shi Feng\u2019s Chop; its sword pierced towards Shi Feng\u2019s heart.Shi Feng immediately activated Windwalk, his body abruptly dodging to a side as he distanced himself from the demon\u2019s doppelganger.After missing its attack, the doppelganger turned its head, using Windwalk as well to chase after Shi Feng.Regarding Strength, speed, and HP, the demon\u2019s doppelganger held most of the advantage. Moreover, the doppelganger also possessed the same Skills as Shi Feng. It was an extremely unfavorable situation for Shi Feng.Seeing that it was about to catch up to Shi Feng, the demon\u2019s doppelganger revealed a ruthless smile, saying, \u201cI know whatever you know. Moreover, my strength is greater than yours. You have no chance to defeat me, so be good and wait for death. This is your fate.\u201d\u201cThen, do you know this move?\u201d Shi Feng revealed a faint smile. Nine sword phantoms appeared beside him, and with a crashing sound, all nine of them shot towards the demon\u2019s doppelganger.Although the doppelganger could block a majority of the attacks, a few phantoms of the Abyssal Blade still managed to pierce its body. Every attack from the phantoms dealt over -30 damage to the doppelganger.\u201cDespicable human, you are just relying on your weapon\u2019s strength. I\u2019ll let you know that all your efforts will be in vain,\u201d saying so, the doppelganger rushed to Shi Feng\u2019s front and used Thundering Flash.The moment the sword lights came, Shi Feng calmly smiled as he took out two scrolls from his bag; one of them was a Speed Scroll, while the other was a Polymorph Scroll. Within an instant, Shi Feng\u2019s speed abruptly increased, dodging to a side and avoiding the strikes from Thundering Flash. At the same time, he turned the demon\u2019s doppelganger into a sheep.After turning it into a sheep, Shi Feng immediately slashed at it with his sword.Thundering Flash!Unable to dodge, the demon\u2019s doppelganger received all three sword lights. As a result, Shi Feng\u2019s Level 5 Thundering Strike caused three terrifying damages of -112, -135, -163.The demon\u2019s doppelganger was greatly enraged as it activated Defensive Blade. With its attack range greatly increased, it immediately slashed its sword down at Shi Feng. This human was just too despicable. He actually used an unsightly method such as turning it into a sheep.\u201cHehe, and here I wondered how strong a demon would be. You clearly have a body that\u2019s stronger than mine, yet, you are still using the same skills as I do. I guess your standards are just at this level, \u201c Shi Feng mocked as he dodged the incoming attack.\u201cYou are courting death!\u201d A single sentence from Shi Feng nearly caused the demon\u2019s doppelganger to faint from anger. It sent a Double Chop at Shi Feng\u2019s neck.Shi Feng pointed the Abyssal Blade at the demon\u2019s doppelganger, and within an instant, nine pitch-black chains appeared and bound it, restricting it for three seconds.Phantom Kill!Simultaneously, both the original and doppelganger activated Defensive Blade, and both started an onslaught on the demon\u2019s doppelganger.Thundering Flash, Chop, Earth Splitter, Double Chop, and many more skills struck the demon\u2019s doppelganger. In addition to the continuous attacks from the Nine Dragons Slash, the demon\u2019s doppelganger\u2019s HP madly decreased, dropping down to 10% within a moment.\u201cSo what if you have a strong physique? So what if you know all of my Skills? So what if you are a demon?!\u201d Shi Feng demanded he pierced the chest of the demon\u2019s doppelganger. Meanwhile, the demon\u2019s doppelganger could only grit its teeth, grimacing in pain; its fury burned within it.The moment the bindings restricting it were released, it would be able to properly deal with Shi Feng. Just as it was about to bring out its special ability, however, the demon\u2019s doppelganger saw the scroll within Shi Feng\u2019s hand. Suddenly, the demon\u2019s doppelganger thoroughly despaired.\u201cBye-bye!\u201d Shi Feng waved his hand at the demon\u2019s doppelganger. He knew that the demon\u2019s doppelganger was about to show its hand, so he had activated the Tier 1 Magic Scroll within his hand.Thunder Bombardment!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis Tier 1 Magic Scroll was capable of dealing -500 damage to a single enemy that was below Level 20. It was more than enough to deal with the demon\u2019s doppelganger that currently had less than 200 HP.Suddenly, a green thunder struck down from the sky above. It caused -500 damage to the demon\u2019s doppelganger, instantly transforming it into dark smoke and it vanished. It also left behind a piece of dark gray-colored equipment.System: Quest \u201cMoon Drip\u201d completed. Rewarding 10,000 EXP, and \u201cDemon Hunter\u201d title.

    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73 \u2013 Demon MaskShi Feng was slightly shocked at seeing the series of notifications.Ten thousand EXP was not considered much to a Level 4 player like himself. It only raised him to 27% of Level 4, and there was still quite a distance away before he became Level 5.On the contrary, it was the other rewards that caused his eyes to shine.Just by killing an extremely foolish Elite Demon, he was able to obtain an ample amount of Reputation as payback. Shi Feng truly did not dare imagine it was real.Reputation was extremely precious within God\u2019s Domain. There were very few Quests that could raise a player\u2019s Reputation, and even those Quests would only increase a minuscule amount.As long as a player\u2019s Reputation was sufficiently high, they would be able to receive high-level Quests that were normally unavailable. Players would also be able to purchase items that were not normally for sale, such as Bronze Equipment, special potions, and so on. At the same time, there would be discounts when purchasing items, and NPCs would have a favorable impression of you. All in all, there were many benefits brought about by Reputation.After a player\u2019s Reputation reached a certain degree, they could also become a Noble.In God\u2019s Domain, Nobles were considered amongst the privileged class, and they enjoyed plenty of benefits. Being a Noble was also a symbol of status. If a Commoner were to anger a Noble, the consequences would be severe. A light offense would result in imprisonment, while a heavy offense would result in execution. Hence, players did not dare offend Nobles. So much so, that even if a Noble were to beat up a Commoner inside a Safe Zone, the Guards would pay no heed to the commotion. This was the gap between statuses.This was also the reason Shi Feng was so shocked.Now that he possessed the title of Noble in Red Leaf Town, he would be able to do things with much more convenience in the future. Shi Feng then thought of several high-level Quests that only Nobles could accept.\u201cWhat function does this Demon Hunter title have?\u201d Shi Feng called out the System Interface, taking a look at the information about the Demon Hunter title.[Demon Hunter]A brave warrior and an exorcist of demons who is revered by others. Wherever you go, you will possess a status equal to a Noble. You are the grim reaper who is feared by all beings affiliated with darkness. In a 100-yard radius, monsters affiliated with Darkness will have their Attributes reduced by 10%. At the same time, attacks you deal towards monsters affiliated with Darkness will have a 10% increase in damage.\u201cCrap, this title is just too awesome,\u201d Shi Feng became slightly excited after reading the introduction to the Demon Hunter title.If a person did not have a considerable understanding of God\u2019s Domain, they would have no understanding of the significance of this title. It was similar to how a dog would not know the value of a gemstone.Shi Feng only became a Noble in Red Leaf Town after his Reputation there had reached 100 points. However, this title was only limited to Red Leaf Town. After leaving the Red Leaf Town, nobody would acknowledge him as a Noble.Of course, if Shi Feng were a Noble of White River City, he would be acknowledged as one throughout the area under the administration of White River City. The title had a much wider range of application. Compared to a Noble of a Town, the difference between the two was obvious at a glance.Meanwhile, a Demon Hunter would have the status of a Noble in every region. This meant, that even after leaving Star-Moon Kingdom, Shi Feng would still be acknowledged as a Noble in other countries. It should be known that not every country was friendly with each other. There were even some who were enemies. If Shi Feng wanted to do a Quest in another, he would have to go through many difficulties and even be discriminated against. However, with this title, he would no longer be discriminated against by NPCs. This was the true value of the Demon Hunter title. Compared to it, being a Noble in Red Leaf Town was no longer worth mentioning.Shi Feng picked up the equipment dropped by the demon\u2019s doppelganger.[Demon Mask] (Special Item)Upon wearing it, the user can disguise himself as another person. Disguise cannot be broken without using a high level observing skill.\u201cTruly a good item. The 6 Gold I spent was definitely worth it.\u201d Shi Feng happily stored the Demon Mask. This item was an artifact meant for robbing houses. Although he wouldn\u2019t do such a thing, it would not hurt him to use it for other matters.\u201cAdventurer, the ceremony has ended. Carrying out this ceremony has greatly weakened me, so I am going to White River City to recover for some time. If you wish to know more information about the Bible of Darkness, then find me there along with my payment. I will be waiting for you.\u201d Currently, Sharlyn appeared to be very delicate, her previous shrewdness completely gone. After saying her piece, she immediately activated a Teleportation Circle and went to White River City to recover.Shi Feng was inwardly shocked as he watched Sharlyn\u2019s beautiful image departing.The Moon Drip ceremony this time was definitely not as simple as he previously thought. Otherwise, a Divine Official, which was a Tier 3 Job, would not be so greatly weakened. Even Shi Feng felt as though he would be able to defeat Sharlyn right now. One could imagine just how weakened Sharlyn was.\u201cForget it; that\u2019s none of my business. Now that the curse has been dispelled, and my Attributes have recovered, I can finally start speed-leveling. The earlier I reach Level 10, the earlier I can activate the Teleportation Gate to White River City.\u201d Shi Feng shrugged his shoulders, no longer minding the matters of great characters. A small character like him still had many matters to take care of. To build up from nothing, many things needed to be done. Forget competing with those Guilds; just being paid attention to by a Great Demon had caused him enough headaches. He was not so leisurely as to pay attention to other matters.Following which, Shi Feng departed from the Library. He headed to the Chef\u2019s Association to take a look at Violet Cloud\u2019s current progress.Red Leaf Town, Trade Area\u2026Just after setting foot in the Trade Area, Shi Feng discovered something fishy.Now that the sun had risen, logic dictated that players should have gone out to level up. Yet, the streets were currently filled with players who were holding discussions with each other. In short, it was extremely lively. It was as if a festival of celebration was being held. From time to time, Shi Feng could also see some of the upper echelons of large Guilds running about the streets, shouting. They were urgently shouting, \u201cPurchasing game currency; the greater the amount, the more we\u2019ll pay.\u201dIf it were any other time, Shi Feng would not think much of it. However, the street was currently filled with various players purchasing game currency. Now, that was something abnormal.What happened?The big shots from Guilds were actually loosely buying game currency from average players. According to reason, these Guilds would have their own money-farming teams or a signed contract with money-farming specialists. In such a way, they would be able to obtain a lot of game currency. However, their current actions meant the game currency supplied by the money-farming teams was insufficient.Originally, Shi Feng was still fretting over the problem of how he would get these Guilds to spend their money. Now, however, it would seem that he had done something unnecessary.With a wave of his finger, Shi Feng called out the Virtual Trade Center. He wanted to investigate the current trade conditions.\u201cHell, what sort of situation is this? All of it is sold out already!\u201d Shi Feng discovered that the remaining 2 Gold 70 Silver he registered had all sold out. Now, over 15,000 Credits were being transferred to his bank account.Consequently, Shi Feng then took a look at the sales condition of other God\u2019s Domain game currency.Currently, the highest price for 1 Silver Coin had reached 72 Credits, while a majority of the people were buying them at 68 Credits. The current price had increased by no small margin.Just as Shi Feng was rejoicing over having sold all of his Gold Coins, a cursing voice came from behind him, breaking his good mood.\u201cBoss, this bastard\u2019s the one. The day before yesterday, I saw him casually taking out 10 Silver Coins. He must definitely be rich. Now that our Guild is in such a need of money, if we don\u2019t make this brat bleed a little, there will be no justice for me being locked up for so long,\u201d Drifting Blood said with a cold smile as he pointed towards Shi Feng, a group of players following behind him.\u201cBrat, you were the one who had attacked my brother?\u201d looking towards Shi Feng, the person referred to as \u2018Boss\u2019 snorted as he asked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Feng turned around, his brows wrinkling after taking a look.The person referred to as \u2018Boss\u2019 was comparable in size to Cola. He had a fierce-looking face, and he seemed to be around thirty years of age. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, he once crossed paths with this person. Similarly a Swordsman, the person was named Ironsword Lion. He was one of the finest experts in Martial Union, and his strength was extremely powerful. During those days, their two Guilds had fought over monsters on several occasions, and Ironsword Lion killed Flaming Tiger twice throughout those confrontations. Ironsword Lion caused Shi Feng\u2019s party major losses, and they had no choice but to flee in dejection.Even Stabbing Heart of Assassin\u2019s Alliance suffered defeat at the hands of Ironsword Lion. From then on, Ironsword Lion\u2019s name was widely spread, allowing Martial Union to rise to a third-rate Guild.Shi Feng intended to say something, but he was interrupted by Ironsword Lion.Ironsword Lion looked at Shi Feng\u2019s scrawny body. Although the equipment on Shi Feng was of good quality, Shi Feng himself did not possess the air of an expert, and furthermore, he did not possess a Guild Emblem. Ironsword Lion determined that Shi Feng was just a leisure player and that he must\u2019ve bought some equipment just to show off. Immediately, Ironsword Lion proudly said, \u201cLittle brother, since you\u2019ve beat my underling, pay up 20 Silver Coins, and this matter will be over. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame my sword for being merciless.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74 \u2013 Ironsword LionIt would be a miracle not to attract attention, getting involved in a robbery in the middle of the bustling Trade Area.As expected, just after Ironsword Lion finished speaking, a crowd of players surrounded them to get in on the fun.\u201cHuh, isn\u2019t that Ironsword Lion from Martial Union?\u201d\u201cIs he awesome or something?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t say! Why don\u2019t you look at his level and equipment? He\u2019s one of the rare few Level 5 experts, and he is wearing at least 6 pieces of Bronze Equipment. I\u2019ve also seen the weapon in his hand before. It\u2019s called Knight\u2019s Longsword, a very awesome weapon amongst Level 4 Bronze Weapons. Moreover, he previously killed a lot of players outside the town, earning him a lot of glory.\u201d\u201cChe\u2026 they\u2019re just relying on numbers to bully others. How can that even be considered being skillful? If they\u2019re that good, they should fight those large Guilds. At most, they can only bully newbies. They\u2019re even asking that guy for 20 Silver Coins; isn\u2019t that just going overboard? Gaming experts would only have 3 or 4 Silver Coins on them, not to mention carrying 20. They are clearly forcing him into a corner.\u201d\u201cShh! Speak softer! That Ironsword Lion isn\u2019t bullying people with numbers. His strength is the real deal. Previously, he was a top-tier expert in a Wuxia virtual reality game, but he was compelled to transition to God\u2019s Domain. Yesterday, he kill-stealed[1] outside of town with other players and single-handedly defeated all four of them. Those four players were not noobs but gaming veterans. They are stronger than us by at least a few leagues. If Ironsword Lion were to hear you, then tough luck, buddy. At that time, your only way out would be to delete your account and start all over again\u2026\u201dListening up to this point, the surrounding players all sucked in a breath of cold air. They no longer dared spout baseless gossip, their eyes sending pitiful gazes towards Shi Feng. Of all the people Shi Feng could provoke, he had chosen to provoke an expert. Moreover, an expert that covered up the shortcomings of his subordinates. Unless Shi Feng deleted and recreated his account, he would definitely have to pay the 20 Silver Coins. However, leveling up to Level 4 was a difficult task. If Shi Feng chose to delete his account, then two days of his effort would be wasted. The average person would rather pay up than delete their accounts.\u201cThis guy is just meeting one misfortune after the other. If it were normal times, he would just have to spend a few Credits to collect the 20 Silver Coins. Now, however, not only are the prices for God\u2019s Domain game currency ridiculously high, but it is also extremely hard to buy any.\u201d\u201cRight! Seeing such a high buying price, even I am thinking of selling my game currency. However, going with this trend, the prices will still increase in the future. I want to stock up a little more, putting them up for sale later on.\u201dJust as the surrounding players were lamenting over Shi Feng\u2019s bad luck, at a stall by the street, several players were quietly watching Shi Feng. These players all wore luxurious equipment on their bodies, and each of them carried a faint smile on their faces.\u201cBrother Stabbing Heart, should I go lend a hand? That way, Ye Feng will have to owe us a favor,\u201d a male Cleric that resembled a skinny monkey asked as he looked at Stabbing Heart.Stabbing Heart fell into deep thought. He felt that the Cleric\u2019s words were logical. Indeed, Shi Feng had very powerful techniques, and he was also acquainted with a great character like the Snow Goddess. However, Ironsword Lion was a brutish expert. He also had the support of his Guild. Overall, Shi Feng was definitely in a disadvantageous situation. If Stabbing Heart were to lend Shi Feng a helping hand, Shi Feng would definitely be grateful to him.The favor of a great expert was extremely valuable. Often, a great expert such as Shi Feng was necessary for clearing a large Dungeon. However, without good relations, such experts would usually pay zero heed to invitations, and some would go so far as to look down on them in contempt. Who did you think you are? Have you not received any education?\u201cGo, we definitely must go. However, let us wait for a while. Our value will only stand out in a crucial moment. It is also a good chance to let those plebeian Guilds know of our might,\u201d Stabbing Heart softly said, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.After spending so many years within the virtual gaming world, Stabbing Heart understood a single principle. Every additional expert he befriended was an additional path he could take in the future. What\u2019s more, Shi Feng was a great, hidden expert that was acquainted with the Snow Goddess. If he were to antagonize instead of befriending Shi Feng, he would be digging his own grave. He would be creating a great enemy for himself in the future.Alas, a small Guild was doomed to remain a small Guild. After mingling about for so many years, they did not even possess the eyesight to differentiate an expert from average players. It definitely wouldn\u2019t be long before natural selection eliminated them.When the moment came, Assassin\u2019s Alliance would kill the chicken to warn the monkey[2], utilizing Martial Union to raise their influence in Red Leaf Town.\u201cLittle fool, weren\u2019t you so awesome? How come you\u2019re acting like a fool now? I\u2019ve said before that I would return, and when that time came, it would be your time of death. If you obediently hand over 20 Silver Coins right now, you can continue mingling about. Otherwise, delete your account and start all over again.\u201d Standing behind Ironsword Lion, Drifting Blood watched Shi Feng stand there in silence. He felt immensely pleased with himself, thinking Shi Feng had become afraid. However, such a reaction was only natural. Boss Ironsword\u2019s strength was a profound mystery, and even ten of himself would not be a match to Boss Ironsword. If a mere leisure player like Shi Feng were to meet the tyrannic Boss Ironsword, he might have already been shocked dumb.\u201cEnough, Drifting Blood. I\u2019m not an evil tyrant, nor do I wish for more trouble. These 20 Silver Coins can be considered as a lesson to him. I want him to know who he should and should not provoke.\u201d Ironsword Lion looked Drifting Blood in the eye, then turned towards Shi Feng and proudly said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, either. I, Ironsword Lion, am a person who holds true to my words. Hand over 20 Silver Coins, and as long as you don\u2019t provoke Martial Union, we will not find trouble with you.\u201dHearing Ironsword Lion say so, Shi Feng really took out 20 Silver Coins from his bag, the silvery glow given off by the coins attracted people\u2019s hearts.At this crucial period of the game, 20 Silver Coins were extremely hard to procure, even if one spent Credits to purchase them. As for taking out 20 Silver Coins in one go\u2026\u201cCrap, brat, you really are rich! So, what Drifting Blood said was indeed true. How about we become friends, and I\u2019ll cover for you in the future. Anybody who provokes you will be provoking Martial Union,\u201d Ironsword Lion was greatly shocked at seeing the 20 Silver Coins, gulping down his saliva. Even he did not possess 20 Silver Coins right now. He did not imagine that Shi Feng, a leisure player, could bring out 20 Silver Coins. With that much money, Ironsword Lion would have much more confidence in competing for the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design.When the surrounding players saw all these Silver Coins, their mouths all gaped wide in shock.Shi Feng was truly rich. He was definitely a tycoon.Some of the upper echelons of large Guilds also had their eyes turn red after seeing this scene. Ironsword Lion\u2019s luck was truly good. He was able to meet a Brother Tycoon just by simply searching for a player.\u201cHow could it be?\u201d From afar, Stabbing Heart\u2019s expression was one of incomparable shock after witnessing Shi Feng\u2019s actions.However, what Stabbing Heart was shocked about was not the amount of money. Instead, he was shocked by Shi Feng\u2019s unexpected action. Even if Shi Feng could not win in a fight against Martial Union, this place was currently a Safe Zone; nobody would dare to take action in here. After leaving the Town, with Shi Feng\u2019s skills, escaping was definitely not a problem. So, just why did Shi Feng compromise and offered up 20 Silver Coins?\u201cYou wanted 20 Silver Coins, right?\u201d Shi Feng asked Ironsword Lion with a smile.\u201cMmhmm, let\u2019s trade.\u201d Noticing that he had lost his composure, Ironsword Lion immediately turned serious.Just as everyone was watching Ironsword Lion with envy\u2026An incomparably pitch black longsword pierced through the pit of Ironsword Lion\u2019s stomach. Ironsword Lion\u2019s HP was instantly reduced by over 100 points. Just as the person himself wanted to resist, he had discovered many chains binding him, preventing him from even moving a muscle.Shi Feng calmly pulled the Abyssal Blade out from Ironsword Lion\u2019s stomach. He then followed up with a Chop and an Earth Splitter, his sword slashing down on Ironsword Lion\u2019s body. As a result, Ironsword Lion\u2019s HP madly fell without any signs of stopping.The might of a Magic Weapon was incomparably shocking, even more so when coupled with a Level 6 Chop and a Level 4 Earth Splitter. Killing a Level 5 Swordsman fully geared with Bronze Equipment was a truly simple matter, not to mention that Shi Feng had been the one to take the initiative and carried out a sneak attack. Even an expert would fall under such circumstances.These two attacks took all of Ironsword Lion\u2019s HP. Ironsword Lion did not even get the chance to retaliate before letting out a pitiful cry, his body falling to the ground, never to move again. Then, his body turned into starlight, vanishing and leaving behind a piece of equipment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWho else wants it?\u201d Shi Feng fixed his gaze on the members of Martial Union, giggling as he asked.The entire street of the Trade Area suddenly became deathly silent.

However, one thing that made everyone feel odd was that Shi Feng\u2019s sword was not really that fast. From their perspective, even they could easily dodge Shi Feng\u2019s sword. So, why couldn\u2019t an expert like Ironsword Lion?Ironsword Lion died without even being able to retaliate.Could it be\u2026 did Ironsword Lion just looked impressive, but was actually a weakling? Was he just a paper tiger?However, everyone immediately denied such a silly notion in their hearts.Ironsword Lion\u2019s equipment was not fake. Him being Level 5 was not fake, either. He was a genuine expert. However, how could an expert fully geared in Bronze Equipment, whose Defense and HP far outstripped the average player, be killed so easily? It was truly inconceivable.Even if an average player were to attack Ironsword Lion madly, they would need quite some time before they could kill him off. However, Ironsword Lion was taken care of by Shi Feng in only two moves.How horrifying of an Attack Power did Shi Feng possess to achieve such a feat?Thinking up to this point, everyone felt utterly defeated.What fat sheep? What tycoon? The Shi Feng before them was simply a devil wearing a human mask, giggling at them. Meanwhile, they had been completely oblivious to the truth. A cold chill suddenly flowed through their bodies, causing them to shiver. They no longer dared to look at Shi Feng\u2019s smiling face.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re despicable!\u201d Drifting Blood retreated a few steps, his trembling finger pointing at Shi Feng. Currently, Drifting Blood was facing incomparable shock in his heart. Compared to other people, he had a much greater understanding of Ironsword Lion\u2019s strength. Regarding Shi Feng\u2019s strength, he had a deep experience and fear of it. He became even more frightened now that he was targeted by Shi Feng once more. However, after having a better understanding of the situation, the place they were currently was a Safe Zone. What should he be afraid of? Suddenly, he laughingly said, \u201cYou\u2019re finished! Since you dared kill inside a Safe Zone, nobody will be able to protect you now. Just wait for the Guards to come give you your sentence and lock you up.\u201dEveryone came to a sudden realization after hearing Drifting Blood say so. Previously, Shi Feng sent all of them into shock. They had actually forgotten that this place was a Safe Zone and there were powerful Guards protecting this place. Even if Shi Feng was powerful, was he able to overpower the Guards? In a moment, Shi Feng would definitely be captured by the Guards, falling to a miserable end.\u201cTruly a pity. However, he is truly courageous for killing someone inside a Safe Zone. It would still be worthwhile, even if he were killed by the Guards and sent to closed confinement. Whatever the case, he was able to shine for a moment. He will still be a hero when he gets released tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSo cool! Big Brother Expert, little sister knows how to warm beds! Please add me as a friend! Please help me level! I swear I\u2019ll be obedient!\u201dAmongst the players present, plenty started admiring Shi Feng\u2019s courage. Not only did he dare to go against Martial Union, he even challenged the laws of Red Leaf Town. Shi Feng was literally their idol. Quite a number of good-looking female players started looking up information about Shi Feng. Some of them had even taken the initiative to send him a friend request, wanting to get to know him.At this moment, a team of heavily-armored soldier walked over.Drifting Blood pointed at Shi Feng, laughingly saying, \u201cWeren\u2019t you very awesome? I want to see what you\u2019re going to do this time. Not only are you going to lose a level, but you will also be confined for 24 hours. Even if you are an expert, you will be reduced to a second-rate player after being confined for a day. At that time, I\u2019ll be looking forward to how our Martial Union will take care of you. Whether you go up to Heaven or fall to Hell, nobody will be able to save you.\u201dA distance away, Stabbing Heart was currently feeling endless regret.Although Shi Feng\u2019s series of actions just now looked to be slow, the feeling it gave off was extremely natural. His actions were as natural as breathing, not a hint of awkwardness about them. Stabbing Heart\u2019s admiration for Shi Feng was even greater now.Shi Feng\u2019s actions were the assassination techniques that Stabbing Heart pursued after.Average people would not understand what this represented. However, Stabbing Heart had played plenty of virtual reality games before, and he also had experience participating in fighting competitions. Hence, he understood just how powerful Shi Feng\u2019s skills were.If it were the him of the past, Stabbing Heart would not feel anything special about Shi Feng.However, he previously had the fortune of interacting with a martial arts master. That martial arts master previously mentioned such a situation.Battling itself was just the pursuit of the simplest method of slaughter. When such a technique was mastered to the extreme, others would be unable to feel any awkwardness about it. Instead, it would give off a very natural feeling.As for those experts who had reached such a level, all of them were extremely dangerous. That was because, even if they were to stand before you with a smile, slashing a blade across your throat and you clearly witnessed it all, you would still take it as a joke. So much so that you wouldn\u2019t even feel the danger that approached you. Your body would not react, and even until death, you would still be unaware of the attack.This was not some sort of profound technique. It was a kind of instinct that could only be learned after experiencing countless battles and training. However, such brutal training was not something the average person could go through.However, Shi Feng had taken away Stabbing Heart\u2019s rare chance at making Shi Feng owe him a favor. Stabbing Heart did not imagine Shi Feng would be so decisive, killing Ironsword Lion with zero hesitation. How was he supposed to show off now? How was he supposed to find an opportunity to seek Shi Feng\u2019s guidance now?Stabbing Heart had no ways to deal with the Guards who just arrived. Regarding this situation, Stabbing Heart held bitter hatred towards Ironsword Lion. The person actually caused him to lose a good chance to ask for guidance.Wearing a silvery-gray heavy armor, the Guard Captain walked up to Shi Feng. The other Guards surrounded him accordingly, causing the atmosphere of the street to become abnormally oppressive.\u201cMister Guards, it was him who killed my big brother. You definitely must arrest him!\u201d Drifting Blood walked towards the Guard Captain, his face carrying a cold smile as he pointed at Shi Feng, accusing.However, the Guard Captain paid no heed to Drifting Blood. Instead, his deep gaze shifted to Shi Feng, a faint smile appearing on his face, saying, \u201cRevered Lord Demon Hunter, this place is Red Leaf Town. According to the laws of the Town, you have to pay the price for killing someone here. Otherwise, I can only invite you to make a trip to the Confinement Room.\u201dEveryone became dumbfounded after listening to the Guard Captain\u2019s words. Drifting Blood\u2019s mouth widened even more; it could fit three chicken eggs.What sort of situation was this?The Guards did not actually kill Shi Feng on the spot? Moreover, he would only be confined if he did not pay the fine. Was Shi Feng the Town Mayor\u2019s son or something?No, that wasn\u2019t right. The Town Mayor was already dead.No one understood why the Guards were so courteous today. When usually meeting them, not to mention a faint smile, they were gods of slaughter with grim expressions.\u201cI only killed him because he threatened me. However, I am not an unreasonable person. Tell me, what price do I have to pay?\u201d Shi Feng nodded his head, calmly turning towards Drifting Blood and giving him a calm smile.Shi Feng had his own reasons for daring to kill Ironsword Lion. Everyone else just recently entered God\u2019s Domain, so they were still unfamiliar with the rules of the game. However, Shi Feng had lived within God\u2019s Domain for ten years. He had long since memorized what actions he could and could not take and to what extent he could take them.Shi Feng was currently a Noble. His status far outstripped that of commoners. If he was not a Noble, he might have just turned around and left without paying any attention to Ironsword Lion. At worst, he would just start an exciting battle if they were to meet outside the Town. Who would win at that time was still an unknown.However, Shi Feng was now a Noble. Even if he killed a normal player, the Guards would not speak much of it, only requiring Shi Feng to pay a fine. As for how much he would have to pay, that depended on his identity and status. However, according to his own wealth, Shi Feng was still able to accept the fine.\u201cTwo Silver Coins.\u201d The Guard Captain straightforwardly said.\u201cOk, got it. Here are 20 Silver Coins; keep them.\u201d Shi Feng did not imagine that it would be so cheap. Hence, he took out 20 Silver Coins and passed it to the Guard Captain.\u201cLord Demon Hunter, what are you trying to do here?\u201d Looking at the 20 Silver Coins in his hand, the Guard Captain oddly asked.\u201cNothing much. These people before me threatened me previously, so I still wish to kill a few more people. Take it as an advanced payment.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d the Guard Captain was stunned.Finished speaking, Shi Feng unsheathed the Abyssal Blade. He used the Level 5 Thundering Flash, three streaks of thunder instantly piercing the bodies of Drifting Blood and the others. All of them were instantly killed, dropping quite a lot of equipment. Even till death, Drifting Blood had not reacted to what happened.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the same time, Shi Feng\u2019s green colored player indicator had turned a devilish red.All of the onlookers were stupefied.Who was this Shi Feng?! He was just too awesome!The players from Martial Union were most likely dumbfounded now. Shi Feng had simply spent 20 Silver Coins to purchase their lives. With money, you could do whatever you wanted!The more unfathomable thing was that the Guard Captain did not say a word about Shi Feng\u2019s actions. He only counted the number of players who died. Discovering that he had received 4 extra Silver Coins, he returned the additional Silver Coins to Shi Feng before he turned around and left\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 76 \u2013 Earth-Shattering NameAfter getting rid of all of Martial Union\u2019s members, Shi Feng sealed the feud between him and Martial Union. However, Shi Feng did not regret his actions.Even if he turned and left just now, the players from Martial Union would not have let him go. So, he might as well weaken Martial Union\u2019s strength. He would have an easier time dealing with them the next time they met.Seeing several pieces of equipment on the ground, without paying any attention to the shock and curiosity of the onlookers, Shi Feng went over and collected them. At the very least, these items could recompense the money he lost for purchasing lives.\u201cOh, isn\u2019t this the Knight\u2019s Longsword?\u201d Shi Feng discovered that two pieces of Bronze Equipment dropped, and one of the two was the Bronze Weapon of Ironsword Lion. Perhaps Ironsword Lion was already spewing blood in anger in the graveyard right now.The Knight\u2019s Longsword was a good weapon amongst Level 4 Bronze Equipment. In God\u2019s Domain, equipment for Weapons Specialists and MTs were slightly higher than other equipment of the same Level. Currently, the Knight\u2019s Longsword would be worth at least 10 Silver Coins. In addition to the other piece of Level 3 Bronze Cloth Armor and several pieces of Common Equipment\u2026Shi Feng discovered that he actually did not take a loss. On the contrary, he had made an additional 1 or 2 Silver Coins.Just when Shi Feng was planning to leave, a change occurred to the gazes of the onlooking players. Greed permeated their faces.Shi Feng had easily taken care of Ironsword Lion. He even killed several elite players with a single move. Not even a ghost would believe that Shi Feng did not possess top-tier equipment. Moreover, Shi Feng was currently a Red Player.If a Red Player were killed, the penalty they received would increase. Moreover, Shi Feng had killed so many players. If he were to die, he would at least drop three or four pieces of equipment. So, what if the Guards confined them for some time? Could it compare to obtaining top-tier equipment?If a noob wished to grow into an expert, having good equipment was a must. If they were to kill Shi Feng, they would have a chance at becoming an expert. So, why wouldn\u2019t they kill him, unless they were willing to remain mediocre?\u201cWhat? You guys are looking for trouble with me, as well?\u201d Shi Feng coldly laughed as he looked at his surroundings. It had been awhile since he felt the sensation of being deep within enemy grounds.After receiving Shi Feng\u2019s cold glare, everyone inadvertently retreated. None of them dared to be the first to attack. They were all waiting for someone to attack first, then take advantage of the situation to reap benefits for themselves.\u201cAll of you, get out of the way! Ye Feng is a friend of our Assassin\u2019s Alliance. Whoever looks for trouble with him, will be looking for trouble with our Assassin\u2019s Alliance!\u201dAt this moment, Stabbing Heart, along with a group of over ten subordinates, created a path through the crowd as they headed towards Shi Feng.When the players who wanted to kill Shi Feng heard Stabbing Heart, every one of them were shocked.Who actually was Shi Feng? Not only did he possess formidable strength, but the Assassin\u2019s Alliance even protected him.The Assassin\u2019s Alliance was well-known throughout Red Leaf Town. It was the sole second-rate Guild in Red Leaf Town, and its members could be found throughout the entire Star-Moon Kingdom. However, the core strength of the Assassin\u2019s Alliance was located around the area of White River City. Other Guilds could not compare to its influence.If they were to become enemies with the Assassin\u2019s Alliance, they would really have to delete their accounts and start all over again. That was because the Assassin\u2019s Alliance was famed for their assassinations. The feeling of being targeted by a group of Assassins\u2026 just thinking about it could make a person tremble with unease.With the appearance of the Assassin\u2019s Alliance, the surrounding players no longer dared to have ideas over Shi Feng. Since they could not fish up any advantages, everyone promptly left the scene.\u201cMany thanks,\u201d Shi Feng said gratefully, looking towards Stabbing Heart.\u201cNonsense. With Brother Ye Feng\u2019s strength, even if I didn\u2019t show up, they would still be helpless against you. I was just pushing the boat along the current[1].\u201d Stabbing Heart cupped his hands, saying in admiration, \u201cToday, Brother Ye Feng has really widened my horizons. Even I would find it hard to kill Ironsword Lion. I did not imagine Brother Ye Feng\u2019s skills to be so powerful as to get rid of Ironsword Lion in just a few moves.\u201d\u201cI was just lucky,\u201d Shi Feng calmly said with a smile.\u201cBrother Ye Feng really is humble. However, there is one matter that I can\u2019t make sense of. Why won\u2019t the Guards find trouble with Brother Ye Feng, even when you killed players in the Safe Zone?\u201d Stabbing Heart had faintly guessed the answer already; however, he still did not believe that Shi Feng could accomplish it that quickly.\u201cNothing much. I only have such a special privilege because I just completed a Quest and became a Noble in Red Leaf Town,\u201d Shi Feng did not hide the truth from Stabbing Heart. He knew that he would not be able to hide it, so he might as well reveal a portion of the truth. As for the Demon Hunter title, he would still have to keep it a secret. Otherwise, it would be too eye-catching and attract unwanted trouble.Stabbing Heart\u2019s heart loudly thumped when hearing Shi Feng\u2019s explanation his eyes stared at Shi Feng, mind-boggled.Assassin\u2019s Alliance had spent an unknown amount of effort to obtain Reputation for Red Leaf Town. Yet, they only managed to obtain 10 Reputation to date. Even Broken Wind, Guild Leader of the first-rate Guild, Star River Federation, was only a First Class Citizen, and there was still a long way to go before he became a Noble. However, the Shi Feng before him was actually a Noble already. The difference between them was just too huge!Originally, Stabbing Heart already had a high estimation of Shi Feng\u2019s strength. He truly did not imagine that he was still underestimating Shi Feng. However, according to his memory, he was acquainted with most of the top-tier experts that used swords. Even the ones he weren\u2019t acquainted with, he had at least met before. However, Shi Feng did not resemble any of the figures in Stabbing Heart\u2019s memory.However, the world was a wide place. There was bound to be some top-tier experts who hid from the world.Now that God\u2019s Domain\u2019s influence was growing larger by the day, it wasn\u2019t particularly strange for these experts to enter God\u2019s Domain as well.It was no wonder that the Snow Goddess acted extremely friendly when dealing with Shi Feng. Stabbing Heart guessed that Shi Feng was an extremely famous but hidden expert and that he was merely unaware of him.The earlier he tightened the connection with such hidden experts, the greater the aid it would be towards the Guild\u2019s future development. Thinking of up to this point, Stabbing Heart smiled slightly. He felt his luck was good for discovering a top-tier expert like Shi Feng.Shi Feng, on the other hand, did not know why Stabbing Heart suddenly smiled. He took a glance at the street filled with Guilds purchasing game currency, abruptly asking, \u201cBrother Stabbing Heart, I wonder what has happened here? Why are there so many Guilds trying to collect game currency?\u201d\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know?\u201d Stabbing Heart was slightly shocked, looking at Shi Feng with astonished eyes. This matter had already become well known amongst the players in White River City, so how could Shi Feng not know about it?Shi Feng shook his head, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my Quest all this time, only returning now.\u201d\u201cSo, that\u2019s why. This matter has also only recently started.\u201d Stabbing Heart came to a realization. He then explained, \u201cNot long ago, a Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design appeared on the Auction House. You should know how good the Attributes on the Glimmer Chestplate are. The usefulness of its Forging Design goes without saying. After all the Guilds discovered its existence, all of them started competing over it. Our Guild is no exception.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, our Guild\u2019s background is still slightly lacking, and Star River Federation won the Forging Design for 2 Gold and 33 Silver Coins. Originally, our Guild had already given up. However, it wasn\u2019t long before another Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design appeared on the Auction House. That was the start of all the commotion. Every Guild has started to madly collect funds, all of them wanting to bid on it.\u201cThe bidding this time ended with the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design being sold for 2 Gold 51 Silver Coins. Nobody could have imagined that a third piece would have appeared right when many Guilds were feeling disappointment. Right now, everyone is still bidding over the third piece. However, according to my estimates, the third piece will be sold at an even higher price. Only, nobody knows if there will be more of the Forging Designs up for auction, so I came here to collect game currency.\u201cCurrently, everyone is guessing that Black Flame Forger is selling the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Designs. After all, Bronze Equipment Forging Designs aren\u2019t just cabbage, not to mention similar Forging Designs. Moreover, the Black Flame Forger was the one who previously sold Glimmer Chestplates. So, everyone inwardly understands that these Forging Designs are being sold anonymously by this Black Flame Forger.\u201d\u201cI have to admit that this Black Flame Forger\u2019s strategy is truly clever. Previously, he competed with Hammer Trading to reduce the price of Glimmer Chestplate. However, it turns out that his eyes were not set on the equipment, but on the current Forging Designs. Hammer Trading, who had competed with the Black Flame Forger, had thoroughly become insane as well. Although he declared that he would compete with the Black Flame Forger until one of them went broke, unfortunately for him, the Black Flame Forger no longer paid any attention to him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCurrently, a lot of people wish to get in touch with the Black Flame Forger. Unfortunately, there is no way to contact that person. The Snow Goddess of Ouroboros even posted a thread on the forums, asking the Black Flame Forger to contact her; she wants to discuss the matters of cooperation and wants him to state his price without hesitation. With this, the Black Flame Forger had thoroughly become famous. Aside from White River City, the entire Star-Moon Kingdom is currently discussing the Black Flame Forger. He is currently acknowledged as the number one Forger in all of Star-Moon Kingdom.\u201dStabbing Heart felt deep regret as he spoke; his expression revealed reverence towards the Black Flame Forger.\u201cSo, that\u2019s it. I wonder if Brother Stabbing Heart would be interested in purchasing the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design?\u201d Shi Feng casually asked Stabbing Heart, after having a general grasp of the situation.TL Notes:[1]pushing the boat along the current\u987a\u6c34\u63a8\u821f: taking advantage of the situation for one\u2019s own benefit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With an excited expression on his face, he asked, \u201cCould it be\u2026 Brother Ye Feng, you have the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design?\u201dCurrently, Forging Designs for Bronze Equipment were madly fought over by the large Guilds, all of them competing with the depth of their financial backing. Nobody could firmly say the remaining number of Glimmer Chestplate Forging Designs that would be sold. Maybe the first-rate Guilds would buy up all the Forging Designs; second-rate Guild\u2019s chance to obtain one might never come.If he could obtain a Forging Design for a Bronze Equipment right now, then the Assassin\u2019s Alliance could stay a step ahead of the other second-rate Guilds. They would be able to create a great reputation for themselves and make a large profit. At that time, they would have a greater chance when competing over White River City.However, Shi Feng simply shook his head.Stabbing Heart\u2019s excited mood was suddenly extinguished, becoming downhearted. However, after he gave it some thought, aside from the Black Flame Forger and Hammer Trading, there had yet to be a third player who could bring out a Forging Design. After all, such an item depended on luck to obtain it.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to bid for the Glimmer Chestplate? I can lend you some money,\u201d Shi Feng said in an unhurried tone.Realization struck Stabbing Heart. Shi Feng indeed was very rich. It was obvious that he had considerable possessions from the way he was able to take out 20 Silver Coins without effort. However, compared to those first-rate Guilds, the difference was still far too great. It would be amazing if Shi Feng had 30 to 40 Silver Coins. Hence, Stabbing Heart said with a sigh, \u201cBrother Ye Feng, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe you, but the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design\u2019s price is just too high. Just 20 or 30 Silver Coins won\u2019t be very useful.\u201d\u201cOh, then how much do you need to bid for it?\u201d Shi Feng confidently asked.Although Shi Feng did not know how much was needed to bid for the Forging Design, he had over 4 Gold Coins that he obtained from the two Forging Designs that were sold. The money from these two items had already been deposited in his bag, so he was certain he would be able to bid for the third Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design successfully. He could also make Stabbing Heart owe him a favor by doing so. In any case, these Coins would still end up in his hands. Why would he be against this decision?The results of the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design far surpassed Shi Feng\u2019s expectations. With this many Guilds going all out, competing for the Forging Design, it was no wonder there was a game currency shortage, causing the price to soar. However, this situation was a very good news to Shi Feng. If Shi Feng did not add fuel to the fire right now, he would not be doing his long period of arduous effort any justice.Stabbing Heart raised three fingers, helplessly saying, \u201cThe competition right now is becoming increasingly heated. According to my estimates, we would need at least 3 Gold Coins to secure the bid. Otherwise, there is no hope for success.\u201d\u201cHow much do you have on your side?\u201d Shi Feng asked, taking the initiative. He did not intend to lend Stabbing Heart 3 Gold Coins in a single breath.\u201cI have 2 Gold 10 Silver. It is extremely hard to collect game currency right now, as the other Guilds have purchased almost all of it. I have already planned to give up the competition, and instead, go and level up,\u2019 Stabbing Heart said with a sigh.\u201cThen I\u2019ll lend you 90 Silvers. That way, you will have collected 3 Gold Coins,\u201d Shi Feng said, smiling. He immediately selected to trade with Stabbing Heart, placing 90 Silver Coins in the Trade Window.Stabbing Heart was suddenly shocked when he saw the 90 Silver Coins inside the Trade Window. He did not imagine Shi Feng would possess that much money. Also, Shi Feng had also spent over 10 Silver Coins just now. Didn\u2019t that mean that Shi Feng had at least 1 Gold Coin on his person?If the Assassin\u2019s Alliance did not put all their efforts into collecting funds, then the Guild\u2019s fluid funds would be similar to the amount Shi Feng possessed. However, they were a second-rate Guild, and their Guild members numbered over 20,000. They also had a specialized 500-man money-farming team. Meanwhile, the money Shi Feng had earned, alone, was actually more or less the same as their Guild.\u201cBrother Ye Feng, thank you, truly! I will repay this favor in the future!\u201d Stabbing Heart excitedly exclaimed, \u201cHowever, I can\u2019t just let Brother take a loss. Tomorrow, I will definitely return 1 Gold Coin to you.\u201dCurrently, the game currency of God\u2019s Domain was extremely precious, especially in this period where Forging Designs were being competed over. Originally, Stabbing Heart wanted to purchase it using Credits. However, when he thought about the preciousness of the game currency, it was hard to buy, even if he had the money. Moreover, Shi Feng did not lack Credits. Hence, he did not have the nerve to let those words leave his mouth and instead chose to compensate Shi Feng with an interest of 10 Silver Coins.However, Shi Feng had become slightly speechless as he only wished for Credits. He was shouldering a large debt right now. In addition to the workshop and the rent he needed in the future, he was desperately in need of money. What would he do with that much game currency? How could it be as dependable as Credits?The earlier he started his Workshop, the earlier he could recruit stable party members. When he could enter large-scale Dungeons, he would be able better earn money, level up, and increase the Workshop\u2019s reputation, building a better foundation for establishing his Guild. If he started too late, it would be hard even to set foot in White River City. Every moment counted right now.\u201cBrother Stabbing Heart, don\u2019t say it such. If you didn\u2019t show up today, I would not be able to avoid a bloody battle. I owe you a favor, so for these 90 Silvers, I\u2019ll just sell you each Silver Coin at 60 Credits. Every Guild would be in need of Coins in the initial stages of the game, so you don\u2019t have to be polite with me,\u201d Shi Feng said in a sincere tone.Stabbing Heart was immediately moved by Shi Feng\u2019s words. He thought that Shi Feng was a friend who was worth knowing. If he returned Shi Feng 1 Gold Coin tomorrow, it would cause quite a lot of trouble to the Guild\u2019s operation. Moreover, nurturing Forgers and purchasing materials required large sums of Coins. It couldn\u2019t be any better if he purchased them using Credits.\u201cI can\u2019t thank Brother Ye Feng enough! However, 60 Credits is a little too low. I don\u2019t have the nerve to buy them at that price, and just saying it would cause others to make fun of me. I\u2019ll buy each Silver Coin for 80 Credits for a total of 7,200 Credits. I\u2019ll transfer them to your account immediately.\u201d Stabbing Heart was very joyful. Even if Shi Feng were to have complaints about the matter, Stabbing Heart would still stubbornly transfer all 7,200 Credits to Shi Feng.\u201cBrother Ye Feng, I\u2019ll be leaving to bid for the Forging Design first! If you have any problems in the future, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me. I\u2019ll definitely go all-out to help you.\u201dFinished speaking, Stabbing Heart hurriedly left with his subordinates to the Auction House.Seeing the additional 7,200 Credits in his bank account, Shi Feng helplessly smiled. His opinion of Stabbing Heart grew even more favorable in his heart.Currently, his bank account had more than 20,000 Credits; the money for two Virtual Gaming Helmets was now secured. At the very least, he would not lose the Virtual Gaming Helmet after the 7-day-duration was up and lose the ability to play God\u2019s Domain.The remaining task he had was to earn even more money and collect some funds before the start of the school\u2019s Fellowship Party. Who knew, he might obtain a great chance at the Fellowship Party, building an unshakable foundation for his Workshop.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, Shadow had obtained a big chance at the Fellowship Party. It was precisely because of this chance that allowed Shadow Workshop\u2019s strength to greatly increase, giving them the confidence to compete with other third-rate Guilds over controlling rights for White River City.In this life, since he was to attend the Fellowship Party, he would not let go of this great opportunity, naturally. He would compete for as much as he could.Following which, Shi Feng looked for a Hotel and rented a guest room there.In Red Leaf Town, the Red Name above his head was too eye-catching. If he did not look for a way to deal with it, his every action would attract the attention of surrounding players.\u201cI never thought I would have to use this item this quickly,\u201d Shi Feng took out the Demon Mask from his bag. He could not help but shake his head and laugh.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf he did not have this item, he really would a difficult time solving the matter of his Red Name.After wearing the Demon Mask, Shi Feng adjusted his facial appearance. His new appearance was very different from his original self. At the same time, his Red Name also turned green. If others did not possess a high-leveled Observation Skill, they would not be able to see through his disguise.After confirming that there were no problems, Shi Feng placed his remaining 3 Gold Coins onto the Virtual Trade Center; each Silver Coin was sold for 80 Credits. Based on the current level of competition, as long as the Assassin\u2019s Alliance successfully bid for the Forging Design, those first-rate Guilds and other second-rate Guilds would most likely be unable to sit tight. The competition then would be more insane than now. Shi Feng was not worried that his game currency would not sell.Just as Shi Feng was about to leave the Hotel, a sudden realization flashed past him. He lightly tapped his own forehead.\u201cHow could I forget about this thing! Now that I have the Demon\u2019s Mask, how can I not properly use it?\u201d Shi Feng revealed a bright smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In God\u2019s Domain, it would be inconvenient for Shi Feng to reveal himself in many matters. However, with the Demon Mask, he would be able to have another identity to move about in the darkness, carrying out many tasks that he, himself, could not do.And right now was one such time.After walking out of the Hotel, Shi Feng took a look at his surroundings. He discovered several players behaving oddly. Their eyes were glued onto the Hotel\u2019s main entrance as if they were waiting for something. However, due to the effects of the Demon Mask, these players did not pay any attention to Shi Feng.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t that brat come out yet? Is he planning to stay inside there until his Red Name changes back?\u201d an Assassin standing outside the Hotel entrance said impatiently.\u201cWhat are you in a rush for? That brat is dead for sure. He actually dared to sneak an attack on Boss Ironsword. He even killed so many of our brothers. The enmity between him and Martial Union has already reached an irreconcilable state. I want to see just how long he can hide. If he were to wait foolishly, instead of killing monsters to reduce the weight of his crime, he would need to wait more than thirty hours before his Red Name disappears. Even if he is currently powerful, after more than thirty hours have gone by, our equipment and levels will surpass him by a huge leap. At that time, killing him to Level 0 will be much easier,\u201d another Assassin said with a sneer.While these players from Martial Union were making fun of Shi Feng, they did not notice their target standing right next to them, and that he heard every single detail of their conversation.Martial Union\u2019s sure is quick in taking action. They really are thinking highly of me if they sent a party of Assassins to watch out for me. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have the time to play around with them. I\u2019ll just let them wait for the sky to turn bright.Shi Feng had long since guessed that Ironsword Lion would not let him go. After all, Shi Feng had crossed paths with Ironsword Lion many times in his previous life. He had a very good understanding of Ironsword Lion\u2019s personality; Ironsword Lion would definitely want revenge. Even if he had to pay a great price, as long as he was able to obtain revenge, he would definitely do it. Moreover, he would repay it hundreds to thousands of times over.If one were to put it nicely, Ironsword Lion was a simple man. If one were to put it badly, however, Ironsword Lion was a person with a one-track mind. Others could easily discern his thoughts.Following which, Shi Feng departed from the Hotel with a carefree attitude. Meanwhile, the party of Assassins was still foolishly waiting in front of the Hotel\u2019s entrance. They were jeering at Shi Feng\u2019s cowardice, only daring to hide inside the Hotel. In the end, death would still be awaiting him.At the Trade Area, a sea of people crowded in front of the Auction House. Shi Feng could not even squeeze himself inside to purchase materials. Without a better option, Shi Feng could only give up for now and visit the Chef\u2019s Association to take a look at Violet Cloud\u2019s progress first.Compared to the currently popular Forging Association, the Chef\u2019s Association was completely deserted. There was only a fragment of Lifestyle players entering and leaving the Association.After arriving at the Kitchen he previously rented, Shi Feng readjusted the Demon Mask, returning to his original appearance but still hiding his Red Name.After entering the Kitchen, Shi Feng discovered Violet Cloud currently concentrating on making Fruit Juice. Her hand movements were extraordinarily speedy and experienced. She was currently also Level 3, surpassing many other Lifestyle players.Although Shi Feng had seen many Master Chefs make cold beverages before, none of their actions were as smooth and natural as Violet Cloud\u2019s. It was truly hard to believe why Violet Cloud would say her production speed was extremely slow. Her speed was shockingly fast. Did Violet Cloud intentionally trick him?Shi Feng shook his head, feeling that Violet Cloud had no reason for doing such a thing. Hence, he walked over and suddenly asked, \u201cViolet, how are you faring?\u201dHowever, as if Shi Feng\u2019s question did not enter Violet Cloud\u2019s ears; she was still concentrating on making Fruit Juice. There was nothing else present in her heart.Looking at Violet Cloud\u2019s degree of focus, Shi Feng was slightly shocked himself. He no longer tried to interrupt Violet Cloud and instead, chose to stand by the side and observe her.After more than ten minutes had passed, Violet Cloud had yet to discover Shi Feng\u2019s presence. Meanwhile, she had already crafted more than ten cups of Fruit Juice. These Fruit Juices looked extremely refreshing, and they gave off a faint, captivating fragrance.After she used up the materials in her hands, just when Violet Cloud was about to retrieve more\u2026\u201cAh!\u201dViolet Cloud was shocked into a jump as she discovered that her boss, Shi Feng, was standing behind her. From the looks of it, he had been waiting for quite some time now.Violet Cloud\u2019s heart became frantic as she thought about how she let her employer wait for so long. Lowering her head, she said in a nervous tone, \u201cSir.\u201d\u201cHave you completed the nine hundred cups of Fruit Juice?\u201d Shi Feng asked with a smile. Shi Feng\u2019s evaluation of Violet Cloud had greatly risen as of this moment.The more focused someone was when doing something, the greater the efficiency. It was also easier for them to overcome difficulties. However, not everyone was able to constantly maintain a high degree of focus, just like how a student\u2019s thoughts would wander after studying for a long period of time, or become absent-minded after listening to the teacher\u2019s lecture for some time.However, Violet Cloud possessed extraordinary focus. When carrying out a task, her efficiency would definitely increase by several folds, doing half the work for double the effect. It was no wonder why she was able to become a Cleric God in the end. Even if she were not a Cleric, and instead played some other Job, her achievements would most likely still be great.\u201cEn, they\u2019re all done. However, I obtained a realization when I was making them before. After spending a lot of materials, I created a new Fruit Juice. You won\u2019t blame me for it, right, Sir?\u201d Violet Cloud said, slightly afraid. After all, she did not carry out her task according to Shi Feng\u2019s requirements. After completing the nine hundred cups of Fruit Juice, she went on to concoct other recipes.Shi Feng involuntarily laughed. Looking at the hundreds of cups of Fruit Juice on the table, he encouragingly said, \u201cWhy would I blame you? More than that, I want to reward you. With the new Fruit Juice, I will have greater confidence in carrying out that task of mine. Here are 3 Silver Coins as your reward. I hope that you can bring forth many new creations in the future. As for your share in the sales of these Fruit Juices, I\u2019ll give it to you after I sell them.\u201cAs for the Fruit Juices, you no longer need to make them for now. Afterward, focus on making the Wolf Meat Dishes. I still have a great use for them.\u201dCurrently, players did not regard Wolf Meat as precious. However, after it was turned into a Wolf Meat Dish, its price could be increased over ten times. Such an increase was due to the fact that after consuming the Wolf Meat Dish, every Job would have their main Attributes increased by 5 points, and its duration was one hour.Such an increase was extremely attractive to a majority of the players. The increase was equivalent to gaining another level, and with it, they would be able to kill monsters much more quickly. Only, after taking the manufacturing costs into account, most of the current Chef players did not pay much attention to dishes with such high costs. However, by the time they did pay attention, they would have already missed a huge opportunity.\u201cThank you, Sir. I will definitely complete my task.\u201d Excitement and appreciation filled Violet Cloud\u2019s face after she received the 3 Silver Coins. She felt she was truly lucky for being able to meet Shi Feng. Otherwise, she would still have to conduct sales out in the streets, only to end up selling just a few cups. Even if she were to strive for an entire week, she would not be able to earn 3 Silver Coins. Yet, she had such an amount with just a day\u2019s effort.Following which, Shi Feng stored all the Fruit Juices in his bag. There were more than 1,700 cups of them, and if each cup were sold at 1 Copper Coin, then that would sum up to 17 Silver Coins. To an average player, it was definitely a huge sum of money. To Shi Feng, however, it was just spare change. However, Shi Feng did not intend to sell any of them as he had another use for them.System: The Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design you have placed on auction has been sold. After deducting the processing fees, a total of 2 Gold 76 Silver has been added to your bag space.\u201cHas Assassin\u2019s Alliance won the bid already?\u201d Shi Feng called out the official forums. Just as expected, the Assassin\u2019s Alliance posted a thread, widely advertising the Forging Design they successfully bid on and taking the chance to increase their fame and influence.After all, being able to purchase a Forging Design indicated the Guild\u2019s background. This would cause many leisure players to reconsider their estimates of the Assassin\u2019s Alliance\u2019s strength.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cViolet, if you wish to convert your Coins to Credits, wait for another hour or two before registering them on the Virtual Trade Center. That way, you will be able to obtain a higher price,\u201d Shi Feng reminded Violet Cloud after some thought.\u201cMmhmm.\u201d Violet Cloud obediently nodded her head. Although she did not understand Shi Feng\u2019s intentions, she still chose to believe in him. After all, Shi Feng was currently her knight in shining armor.Afterward, Shi Feng gave Violet Cloud another 5 Silver Coins for her to purchase the materials needed to make the Wolf Meat Dish. He then departed from the Chef\u2019s Association, his appearance changing into an older gentleman.\u201cIt\u2019s about time I contacted her,\u201d Shi Feng had done all the necessary preparations. Moreover, the Assassin\u2019s Alliance had caused the other Guilds to start to panic. So, now was about the right time to contact that person.Shi Feng called out his Friend Window and looked for the Snow Goddess, a cunning smile appearing on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If a party\u2019s positioning were slightly off, they would attract tens of Grassland Lion Cubs towards them. Moreover, at the large tree located in central region of the fields, there lived a Level 6 Elite Grassland Lion. That place could be said to be a forbidden area for Level 6 players.However, inside this forbidden area, Gentle Snow\u2019s party was constantly clearing the surrounding Level 6 Grassland Lion Cubs. They were clearing out an empty land for the purpose of hunting the Elite Grassland Lion. If ordinary players were to see their daring actions, they would definitely exclaim in astonishment.A party waged battle against more than ten Grassland Lion Cubs.Wearing a suit of azure armor, Gentle Snow valiantly battled. She was like a War Goddess, fighting one against ten thousand. A simple slash from her had sent three Grassland Lion Cubs flying. Simultaneously, she was dodging the claws of the remaining two Lion Cubs. If an expert were to see Gentle Snow battle, their eyes might have popped out of their sockets by now. Although her single slash seemed simple, she struck the vital points of all three Grassland Lion Cubs. Her dodges were even more accurate. It was like she possessed eyes at the back of her head. Without even turning her head, she was able to avoid the claw strikes that came from behind her.On another side, the Flame Witch, Zhao Yueru, was like an artillery cannon. A single Frostflame Blast from her had taken away a third of the Grassland Lion Cub\u2019s HP. Just when the Grassland Lion Cub switched Hatred and was about to rush at Zhao Yueru, the woman, herself, revealed a smile of disdain. As her mouth chanted the final verse of an incantation, her lily-white hands finished writing the incantation. Following which, a flame dragon appeared. The dragon spewed scorching hot flames, immediately decimating the Grassland Lion Cub rushing towards Zhao Yueru.Zhao Yueru\u2019s control over magic was extremely subtle, reaching its pinnacle. Her chanting and tracing were even more extraordinary. Normally, players would need 3 seconds to complete both actions, but Zhao Yueru only spent 1.6 seconds. Her Completion Rate was even at 86%, increasing the damage of Fire Dragon\u2019s Roar by 120%. This single move instantly took away two-thirds of the Grassland Lion Cub\u2019s HP.A few moments later, more than ten Grassland Lion Cubs lay dead on the ground.\u201cRest for a while and prepare to lure those two Elite Grassland Lions over. Shield Warrior, you\u2019ll tank one, while I handle the other,\u201d after tidying up the loot, Gentle Snow commanded as she looked towards the two patrolling Elite Grassland Lions in the distance.Just as everyone was resting, Gentle Snow received a single message signed with the name of \u2018Black Flame.\u2019Looking at this signature, Gentle Snow\u2019s brows slightly wrinkled. Previously, she put out word that she wished to discuss matters of cooperation with the Black Flame Forger. It did not take long before she received a reply. Originally, she had felt rather joyous at the fact. However, a few moments later, she received another pile of similar messages. All of them claiming themselves to be the Black Flame Forger. However, after undergoing a simple questioning and identification, she discovered that all of these players were fakes. Every one of them wanted to swindle some money from her.\u201cSnow, is it another harassing message? Why not you just set it so you can only receive messages from your friends. That way, these messages won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201d Zhao Yueru suggested after noticing Gentle Snow\u2019s unnatural behavior.Gentle Snow shook her head, saying in a serious tone, \u201cI\u2019m not acquainted with the Black Flame Forger. If the real Black Flame Forger were to contact us, and we weren\u2019t able to receive his message, wouldn\u2019t we have posted that thread for nothing? I\u2019ll still take a look at it. In any case, it is very easy to determine the authenticity of the Black Flame Forger.\u201dHowever, Gentle Snow suddenly froze when she read the message.That was because this message had very clearly proven the authenticity of this Black Flame. He wanted her to go to the Virtual Trade Center, and using the password he had given, enter a designated Trade Room to trade for the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design.\u201cIt seems that I finally have some gains after waiting for so long.\u201d Gentle Snow revealed a faint smile. From the contents of the message, she could clearly feel that this Black Flame was the real deal. Otherwise, he would not suggest trading the Forging Design at the Virtual Trade Center. After all, Black Flame impostors would not have a Forging Design.\u201cWhat is it? Did the real Black Flame contact you?\u201d Looking at Gentle Snow nodding to her question, Zhao Yueru became immediately excited. Wishing to meet this mysterious Forger, she asked, \u201cWhen do we meet him?\u201dCurrently, the Black Flame Forger was known by everybody. He was even in possession of a Forging Design that could increase a Guild\u2019s influence. After carrying out one questionable action after another, only now did they find out his true motive. Zhao Yueru couldn\u2019t help but admit the brilliance of the Black Flame Forger\u2019s methods.He paid such a huge price all to control the initiative in the game played by the various Guilds. Now, every Guild within the area of White River City could not help but get caught up in this spiral; otherwise, they would be eliminated by the other Guilds. His unpredictable actions even caused her to feel admiration.He was unlike a certain someone who was clearly just a lucky bastard, yet, still pretended to be an expert. Just thinking about that person made Zhao Yueru\u2019s blood boil in anger. Compared to the Black Flame Forger, the difference between them was thousands of miles apart.\u201cI just contacted him. However, he does not want to add us as friends. He only said he wants to meet at the Level 8 map, Physis Canyon, in four hours. Physis Canyon isn\u2019t that far away from our current location. I\u2019ll buy the Forging Design first; then we\u2019ll quickly clear up these Elite Grassland Lions. If we hurry over, we should be able to make it.\u201d Even Gentle Snow was clearly excited right now. There were so many first-rate Guilds in Star-Moon Kingdom, yet, she didn\u2019t imagine that the Black Flame Forger would actually be willing to cooperate with them. She couldn\u2019t help but admit that they were extremely lucky or maybe that Black Flame had some other plans. In any case, she wouldn\u2019t be able to see through the thoughts of this Black Flame.\u201cGreat! Then let\u2019s hurry! If we make him wait too long, it would be terrible if he didn\u2019t want to meet us anymore,\u201d Zhao Yueru abruptly stood up, excitedly saying so.\u201cLook at you in such a hurry\u2026 We still have time.\u201d Gentle Snow rolled her eyes at Zhao Yueru. She did not imagine that Zhao Yueru would be so interested in Black Flame. Normally, she would not be as enthusiastic towards other people she met.Meanwhile, Shi Feng, the target of Gentle Snow and Zhao Yueru\u2019s conversation, had already departed from Red Leaf Town. He was running towards the White Sand Ruins.The White Sand Ruins was a Level 10 monster area. It was also one of the must-come leveling areas for players of Red Leaf Town and several other nearby Towns. That was because the Quests available here were very numerous. Amongst them, there was no lack of Guild Quests and Reputation Quests. There were even two Unique Quests here. The rewards for these two Unique Quests were extremely bountiful, and they would bring plenty of benefits to Shi Feng when he officially entered White River City in the future. Hence why Shi Feng was running to the White Sand Ruins.Just as Shi Feng arrived at a sea of white sand, a message from Gentle Snow arrived. The message stated that they had to delay the meeting time by an hour suddenly, and as a compensation, aside from buying the Forging Design at price of 24,000 Credits, they would give him an additional 20,000 Credits. Their wealth was practically overbearing.Shi Feng did not really mind the delay in time. In any case, he also needed quite some time to complete the Quests here.Meanwhile, 20,000 Credits was two month\u2019s worth of salary of a gold collar worker[1]. Gentle Snow used it as compensation for being late\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMoreover, this was only the start of the business between them; yet, he had already earned more than 40,000 Credits. He could not help but admit that there were many benefits for working with a person like Gentle Snow, especially when the person herself was not lacking money. Even the rich from other virtual reality games could not compete with her.Following which, based on his memories, Shi Feng searched for a secret path in the White Sand Ruins. After walking this path for nearly half an hour, he caught sight of a bunker buried in the white sand. Two Level 10 Elite Blacksteel Dwarves guarded the bunker\u2019s entrance.One of the two Unique Quests, \u201cSteel Fortress Barrutia,\u201d could be found inside this bunker.TL Notes:[1]gold collar worker: Highly skilled professionals who may be in high demand, such as chartered accountants, surgeons, anesthesiologists, engineers, and lawyers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80 \u2013 Steel Fortress BarrutiaBlacksteel Dwarves, they were a group fanatics addicted to forging. The civilization of the Blacksteel Dwarves was once incomparably brilliant, and their shadows could be found in the creation of countless pieces of Legendary Equipment.The arms of Blacksteel Dwarves were as thick and robust as their thighs, and their muscles were as hard as stone. In addition to their dark skin color, often they were mistaken for rocks during nighttime, and many people would sit on them accidentally.Of course, the consequences of such an action were very grave, as the thing these Blacksteel Dwarves hated the most was being treated as stools.Shi Feng straightforwardly walked over.This bunker in the White Sand Ruins was extremely well hidden. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, it took a long time before the many Guilds doing Quests in the White Sand Ruins discovered the bunker. They received many good Quests from this bunker, and some Quests even gave away Mysterious-Iron Equipment. However, such Quests usually required a party in order to complete them. It was absolutely impossible for a person to complete them alone.However, compared to these Quests, the Favorability of these Blacksteel Dwarves was much more important. This secret was also only discovered after players had already reached more than twenty levels.There was a Unique Quest called \u201cSteel Fortress Barrutia\u201d available here. However, because the Unique Quest required a certain amount of favorability before a player could receive it, many players missed the chance to obtain it. On the contrary, an unknown average player received the Unique Quest. Moreover, after completing the Unique Quest, the player instantly become the recruitment target of many Guilds.Arriving in front of the bunker\u2019s entrance, the two Elite Blacksteel Dwarves standing guard let Shi Feng enter after giving him a simple glance.The inside of the bunker was very large. It was just like an underground Town. Blacksteel Dwarves were everywhere, and the majority of the streets were composed of either Weapons and Equipment shops or bars, with very few places of entertainment.Moving along the main street, Shi Feng arrived before a steel building after making several turns and detours. The building was the City Hall, and when Shi Feng entered the building, the Town Mayor, a Level 30 Elite NPC, quickly noticed him. As it has been a long time since any outsiders entered this small Town, the Mayor happily went up to welcome Shi Feng.\u201cHello, Adventurer! Welcome to Stonehammer Town! I am Blackbeard, the Town Mayor!\u201d Blackbeard warmly said.\u201cHello, Lord Mayor. It is my first time coming here, so I wonder if I could be of any use to you?\u201d Shi Feng performed respectfully, as such actions would give NPCs a more favorable opinion of him.Blackbeard caressed his thick beard. After thinking for awhile, he said, \u201cAdventurer, our small Town indeed needs help. The weather of area around here is getting hotter by the day, and our water supply is continuously diminishing. As a result, it is getting harder for the inhabitants to live in this small Town. I will pay a sufficient price, so I hope you can help us obtain a large water supply or something that can help with the heat.\u201dSystem: Do you wish to accept the Quest, \u201cBlackbeard\u2019s Request\u201d?Shi Feng revealed a faint smile. He was here exactly because of this.\u201cI will be happy to help,\u201d Shi Feng responded.The most important thing in Rockhammer Town was the Town Mayor\u2019s Favorability. However, the Town Mayor\u2019s Favorability was not that easy to obtain. That was because the Quest he gave was not easy to complete. Moreover, the rewards of the Quest were few, causing many players to give up on grinding for the Town Mayor\u2019s Favorability.System: Quest \u201cBlackbeard\u2019s Request\u201d accepted. Offer 100 bags of Clear Water or 5 cups of Cold Beverage to the Town Mayor Blackbeard.Following which, Shi Feng retrieved the Fruit Juice he had prepared.For every 5 cups of Fruit Juice Shi Feng offered, he could obtain 2 Copper Coins, an increase of 1 point to Blackbeard\u2019s Favorability, and 100 EXP.To a Level 8 to 9 player, 100 EXP could be considered negligible. Just by simply killing a Level 10 Common monster, they would be able to obtain over 200 EXP. Moreover, 100 bags of Clear Water were sold for 5 Copper Coins in other Towns, and 5 cups of the cheapest kind of Cold Beverage would similarly cost 5 Copper Coins. After deducting the cost, that meant that players would be spending 3 Copper Coins in exchange for 100 EXP. Only a lunatic would be willing to do such a thing.However, Shi Feng was very willing.To his current Level, 100 EXP was not a small amount. It was a lot more than the EXP he would obtain from killing a Level 5 Common monster.Following which, Shi Feng handed over Fruit Juices without stop. After he handed over 1,000 cups of Fruit Juice, he obtained a total of 400 Copper Coins and 200 points of Favorability. He also obtained 20,000 EXP, instantly bringing him up to 69% of Level 4.He had risen so much just within ten short minutes. It was literally faster than grinding on Level 10 Elite monsters.After his Favorability reached 200 points, Shi Feng started asking Blackbeard about the Unique Quest. However, Blackbeard remained silent, his eyes darting about, pretending to know nothing about the Quest.\u201cAs expected, my Favorability is still not high enough.\u201d Shi Feng had more or less expected such a result. Hence, he brought out Violet Cloud\u2019s new type of Fruit Juice, \u201cLord Mayor, what do you think about this kind of Fruit Juice?\u201dAfter seeing this new Fruit Juice, Blackbeard took it in his hands and gave it a whiff. Suddenly, both his eyes shone as he excitedly said, \u201cThis cup completely surpasses the previous five cups. Adventurer, I wonder how many of these do you have? I am willing to pay an extra 1 copper Coin to purchase it.\u201dShi Feng couldn\u2019t help but be stunned when he saw Blackbeard\u2019s extremely satisfied expression. He did not imagine that Violet Cloud\u2019s craftsmanship would be so good as to tempt even an NPC into willingly to concede. Such a situation was very rarely seen in God\u2019s Domain.Since Blackbeard liked the new Fruit Juice, Shi Feng naturally continued the transaction without stop.He had a total of 750 cups of the new type of Fruit Juice. Every cup earned him 3 Copper Coins, 1 point of Favorability, and 100 EXP. It could be seen just how much Blackbeard loved this item.In such a way, Shi Feng easily received 2,250 Coppers and 750 points of Favorability. He also received 75,000 EXP, instantly bringing him to 46% of Level 5. His leveling speed was like a rocket. Unfortunately, making the new type of Fruit Juice required a lot of time. Moreover, Violet Cloud still had other matters to tend to. Otherwise, Shi Feng really wanted Violet Cloud to make up to 10,000 cups for him, instantly rushing to Level 10 and over.With 950 points of Favorability, the Town Mayor Blackbeard finally opened his mouth. Moreover, he did not hide any secrets this time. He was treating Shi Feng like his close friend. Shi Feng had even received the Stonehammer Key, which had not been mentioned by the player in his previous life.System: Unique Quest \u201cSteel Fortress Barrutia\u201d accepted. Player is required to go to Physis Canyon to look for the fallen Steel Fortress Barrutia and obtain the Titan\u2019s Heart from within it. Town Mayor Blackbeard will provide an extremely bountiful reward for it.With such a high amount of Favorability, Shi Feng could also purchase Forging Designs from Blackbeard.Shi Feng was shocked after taking a rough look at the available items. There were a total of ten Forging Designs for sale; five of them were Common Equipment Forging Designs, three of them were Bronze Equipment Forging Designs, one of them was a Mysterious-Iron Weapon Forging Design, and the last was a Mysterious-Iron Equipment Forging Design.Blackbeard must\u2019ve even taken out his inheritance with this!These Forging Designs were all for Level 8 to Level 10 equipment.However, the Bronze Equipment Forging Designs were sold for 60 Silver Coins each, while the Mysterious-Iron ranked Forging Designs were sold for up to 1 Gold and 50 Silver Coins. Even if an average player were to discover them, they would definitely be unable to purchase them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFortunately, this time around, Shi Feng had sold another three pieces of the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design. The money he possessed increased by more than 9 Gold Coins once more. Otherwise, even he could only look at the items with envy.\u201cLord Mayor, these three Bronze ranked Forging Designs and two Mysterious-Iron ranked Forging Designs, I want all of them,\u201d Shi Feng simply handed over 4 Gold 80 Silver.Unfortunately, these Forging Designs were bound upon purchase. Otherwise, he would be able to earn at least double or triple the amount just from reselling them.The weakest amongst these Forging Designs was a Level 8 Bronze Equipment. However, even that would bring about an unimaginable improvement to the current Guilds. After all, the current highest leveled players were just nearing Level 6, while a large majority of the players were still using Level 1 or Level 2 Common Equipment. Just imagining when everyone rose to Level 8 and every member of a party possessed a piece of Level 8 Bronze Equipment was frightening.After completing the transaction, Shi Feng suddenly received a System Notification.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81 \u2013 Equipment ImprovementShi Feng was shocked after reading the System Notification.Blackbeard\u2019s Favorability of him rose to 1000 points, reaching the level of Revered.System: Congratulations! You are the first player to achieve Revered Favorability with an NPC. Rewarding 1 Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chest.\u201cLuck really can\u2019t be stopped once it comes. I wonder what items will come out?\u201d Shi Feng impatiently opened the refined Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chest.Inside the Treasure Chest, there was a piece of equipment and an Ornament.[Dark Pursuer\u2019s Cape](Secret-Silver Rank)Equipment Requirement: Agility 70Defense +20Strength +4, Agility +8, Endurance +4Movement Speed +2Evasion +6Additional Ability: Silent Steps: Allows the user to arrive at the target\u2019s back silently. Maximum range of 40 yards.Cooldown: 3 minutes.[Interpreter\u2019s Pendant] (Mysterious-Iron Rank)Level 7Equipment Requirement: Intelligence 30Intelligence +6, Endurance +2Magic Damage increased by 5%.In the current times, these two pieces of equipment could be considered extremely rare. It was especially true for the Dark Pursuer\u2019s Cape. The Cape was well suited for Weapons Specialists, and it would definitely increase their strength when equipped. Meanwhile, Silent Steps was an ability similar to the Instantaneous Movement of Mages and Shadow Steps of Assassins. It was Equipment meant for PK[1].The Interpreter\u2019s Pendant was even more of a top-tier Ornament. Just based on the 5% increase in Magic Damage alone, Mages could continue wearing the pendant until Level 20 without falling behind in the slightest.\u201cLet\u2019s give this Ornament to Blackie.\u201d After some thought, Shi Feng deemed that Blackie was most reliable person right now, and he was also a Mage. As for the Cape, he was currently unable to equip it. Its requirement of 70 Agility was just too high. At the very least, Shi Feng needed to be Level 10 before he could equip it.Looking at the equipment, Shi Feng suddenly recalled that he was already Level 5. Just by relying on the Abyssal Blade\u2019s Attributes, in addition to adding his 6 Free Attribute Points into Strength, he was now able to equip the Silvermoon Set Equipment.Just at Level 5, Shi Feng was able to equip the best Set Equipment for Swordsman under Level 10. His overall Attributes were literally without rival, and the Quests he would do later on would become much easier.Hence, Shi Feng added all his Free Attribute Points into Strength and equipped the five Silvermoon Set pieces. Also, now that Shi Feng was Level 5, the Swordsman\u2019s Dual-Wielding Talent had activated. Shi Feng was now able to wield two One-handed Swords. Shi Feng then took out the Secret-Silver ranked Crimson Blade, equipping it on his Sub-arm.After completely equipping himself, Shi Feng was shocked when he took a look at his own Attributes. There were very, very few players with Attributes like his in all of God\u2019s Domain.Not to mention the Set Effects on the Silvermoon Set Equipment\u2026Effect 1: Attack Power +15, Defense +30.Effect 2: HP increased by 10%, Life Shield (Tier 2): After activating, creates a Life Shield that absorbs 60% of the damage received, with 500 maximum damage absorbed.Effect 3: Damage received reduced by 10%, Attack Speed increased by 10%.Shi Feng\u2019s HP was now close to 1,000 points. With these three Effects, he was even tankier than an MT. His damage output had received an even larger improvement.Wearing a suit of silvery-white armor, the pitch black Abyssal Blade hanging on one side of his waist while the bloody red Crimson Blade hung on the other, Shi Feng was like a hero that traveling around the world.There was still some time before the meeting with Gentle Snow, so Shi Feng received two Advanced Quests from Hammerstone Town. They were all Quests requiring him to kill Level 10 Twin-headed Snakes. The Quests required 20 Snake Galls and 30 Venomous Fangs. After completing the Quests, Shi Feng would be able to obtain rare Ore and Forging Materials. These materials were all needed to make the Mysterious-Iron Equipment and Weapon, and normally, they were extremely hard to find.After jogging for over twenty minutes, Shi Feng finally arrived at an oasis in the White Sand Desert. There was a group of Twin-headed Snakes circling nearby.[Twin-headed Snake](Common Rank)Level 10HP 950/950Although the Twin-headed Snakes had low HP, an average Level 10 player would not be capable of going solo against them. Normally, they would need help to take these monsters on.Monsters in God\u2019s Domain would have a qualitative change once they reach Level 10. Their attack patterns were extremely flexible, and they knew how to defend against attacks. These were traits you would not find in Common monsters below Level 10. Without plenty of battle experience, average players would find it very hard to block or evade their attacks. Apart from this, their attacks would carry an additional Special Skill, and a slight slip in attention would cost players their lives.As for the Twin-headed Snake\u2019s attack pattern, it would usually attack with one of its heads, while defending with the other. Because of this, a solo player would find it hard to deal damage. In addition to the Fatal Fang skill it possessed, as long as it bit a player, they would be poisoned and lose 50 HP every second for 15 seconds. If they did not dispel the poison, an average player would practically lose their lives to it.Shi Feng slowly closed in on the Twin-headed Snakes.Before he even reached the 20-yard range, a Twin-headed Snake the height of an adult spat out its tongue, rushing towards Shi Feng.Since he had been discovered, Shi Feng took the initiative to rush over as well.Wind Blade!The Abyssal Blade transformed into a black streak of light, piercing towards the vital point of the Twin-headed Snake. The snake reacted extremely quickly, one of its heads immediately bit down on the Abyssal Blade, preventing the Abyssal Blade from moving a single inch. Meanwhile, its other head opened its mouth widely, its sharp venomous fangs leaking a bluish-green poison as it bit at Shi Feng.Shi Feng\u2019s other hand waved the Crimson Blade, the weapon transforming into a red streak as it slashed at the Twin-headed Snake.Peng!He stuck as the Twin-headed Snake was retreating, and a damage of over 60 points appeared above its head. On the other hand, Shi Feng only lost slightly more than 10 HP, and he did not retreat even a single step backward. Following which, the Abyssal Blade slashed towards the undefended belly of the Twin-headed Snake, immediately causing -96 damage. Incidentally, the Abyssal Blade\u2019s ability, Doom Curse, was triggered, greatly reducing the Twin-headed Snake\u2019s Attributes.However, Shi Feng was not finished. He continued slashing the Crimson Blade, piercing the Twin-headed Snake\u2019s vital points and causing another -112 damage.By the time the Twin-headed Snake started reacting, its HP had already been reduced by half.When one of the snake-heads bit at Shi Feng, he dodged to a side, and his foot stomped on the ground, pushing him forward. His actions caught the other snake-head by surprise, rendering it unable attack or defend.Double Chop!The Abyssal Blade and Crimson Blade pierced deeply into the Twin-headed Snake\u2019s abdomen. Shi Feng then abruptly pulled on them, slashing apart the Twin-headed Snake\u2019s body and leaving two long gashes.Two damages appeared above the Twin-headed Snake\u2019s head, -156 and -132. In addition, the snake also received a Bleeding Debuff.The Twin-headed Snake still wished to retaliate. However, before it could reach Shi Feng, it bled itself to death.System: Level 10 Twin-headed Snake killed. Level difference of 5. EXP obtained increased by 500%. Obtained 1,000 EXP.The Twin-headed Snake contributed a Snake Gall to Shi Feng.Shi Feng did not use many skills throughout the entire killing process, mainly only using normal attacks. He easily took care of a Level 10 monster. However, Shi Feng was still not satisfied. It was especially true for his first piercing attack. The Twin-headed Snake actually blocked the attack. Otherwise, he would have been able to kill the Twin-headed Snake with a series of continues strikes.Shi Feng then started searching for his next target.After an hour, Shi Feng had killed over forty Twin-headed Snakes. His experience rose to 81% of Level 5. His leveling speed was like a rocket, and his experience gain was even faster than that of forging equipment.Shi Feng couldn\u2019t help but have mixed feelings about it. With the entire Silvermoon Set Equipment in addition to two top-tier Weapons, killing monsters that were of higher levels became extremely easy. If the situation continued as such, Shi Feng would reach Level 6 in less than an hour.\u201cI\u2019m still missing 3 Snake Galls and 5 Venomous Fangs. However, all the Twin-headed Snakes in this area are already dead. It might take awhile for new monsters to respawn.\u201d Shi Feng observed his surroundings. There was actually not a single Twin-headed Snake present.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Feng had no choice but to run to another spot to grind Twin-headed Snakes.However, just after taking a few steps, three Twin-headed Snakes slithered out from the oasis. Amongst the three, one of them had larger heads than the other two, and there was also a horn on each of its heads. This was a Snake King patrolling its territory.\u201cEn, a Rare Elite, is it?\u201d Shi Feng licked his lips when he saw the Twin-headed Snake King, his lips revealing a faint smile. A Rare Elite was not something that a person could often meet. It would appear randomly, and its strength was slightly more than normal Elite monsters. Its drop rate was also extremely good. Being able to meet one depended all on luck.TL Notes:[1]PK: Player Killing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82 \u2013 Killing the Twin-headed Snake KingThe Twin-headed Snake King, along with its two subordinates, slowly slithered towards Shi Feng. However, it did not discover Shi Feng\u2019s existence. Its tail calmly swayed, and its head proudly raised as it overlooked its own territory.Meanwhile, the two normal Twin-headed Snakes were closely following the Snake King. They did not act proudly like the Snake King, but more like bodyguards, their chilling gazes sweeping across their surroundings. As long as there were any signs of activity, they would immediately become their King\u2019s sharp swords, killing all enemies that were harmful to their King.From when the Twin-headed Snake King approached his location to when it turned around and left, Shi Feng only watched it, silently. However, Shi Feng was in no hurry to make a move. Instead, he stealthily followed it, using Observing Eyes on it, and waiting for the best terrain to start his attack.[Twin-headed Snake King] (Rare Elite)Level 10HP 4,000/4,000The other two Twin-headed Snake Guards were both Common monsters. They were both Level 10, and they both had 1,400 HP.Shi Feng was about to face three Level 10 monsters together. Moreover, there was even a Rare Elite amongst them. Even though Shi Feng equipped with the full Silvermoon Set Equipment, he still needed to plan properly before taking action. After all, the few can\u2019t fight the many. Also, the Snake race had extremely quick Movement Speeds and the Snake King even more so.Shi Feng followed the Twin-headed Snake King to an area filled with sandstone. There were several stones taller than a person here that could be used to obstruct the Twin-headed Snake King\u2019s vision, so Shi Feng finally started taking action.Shi Feng would be at a big disadvantage if he were to take on all three Twin-headed Snakes at the same time. So, he needed to split them up and kill them one at a time, with the Common monsters taking priority.Shi Feng immediately used Phantom Kill, letting his doppelganger stay behind waiting while he took charge. Shi Feng used Wind Blade, his sword stabbing at the nearest Twin-headed Snake Guard.With the ambush and the speed increase from Wind Blade, the Twin-headed Snake was not able to react to the attack at all. Shi Feng\u2019s two swords immediately stabbed it in the backs, causing damages of -76 and -61. Following which, Shi Feng used Double Chop, causing -103 and -89 damage, and leaving the Twin-headed Snake Guard with a Bleeding effect.Shi Feng was fully equipped with top-tier equipment and high-leveled Skills. Even if the Twin-headed Snake Guard had a high Defense, the damage Shi Feng could cause was extremely high. If it were a Level 5 average player attacking the Twin-headed Snake Guard, with the level suppression and the monster\u2019s high Defense, they would at most cause -3 or -4 damage to it.The Twin-headed Snake Guard wailed in pain. It immediately spun its heads around, attacking Shi Feng. The other Twin-headed Snake Guard also came over, biting at Shi Feng. Shi Feng now received attacks from two sides at the same time.Shi Feng slightly smiled at this. He used Thundering Flash, sending three streaks of thunder at one of the Twin-headed Snake Guards. However, the Twin-headed Snake Guard reacted extremely quickly; one of its heads blocked, while the other bit at Shi Feng.The three streaks of thunder were blocked, causing an insignificant amount of damage.Just as the Snake\u2019s venomous fangs were about to bite down, Shi Feng used Parry and activated Windwalk. After blocking an attack, Shi Feng immediately turned around and ran.The Twin-headed Snake Guards would naturally not let go of an enemy who angered them. Slithering at high speeds, they chased after Shi Feng. As for the unharmed Twin-headed Snake King, one could see boiling rage in its chilling eyes. It, too, slithered and chased after Shi Feng.However, just after the Twin-headed Snake King moved several yards, Shi Feng\u2019s doppelganger used Windblade and rushed at the Twin-headed Snake King. The doppelganger slashed at the Twin-headed Snake King\u2019s neck, causing -24 damage. The Twin-headed Snake King was enraged by this attack. With the speed of a thunderbolt, the Twin-headed Snake King bit at the doppelganger.As the doppelganger\u2019s goal had been achieved, it, too, activated Windwalk, turning around and leaving.Now, the Twin-headed Snake Guards were separated from the Snake King. Although the two Twin-headed Snake Guards were tough, without the support of their King, they were unable to stand against Shi Feng\u2019s fierce attacks. One move after another, Shi Feng\u2019s blades would always strike at the vital points of the Twin-headed Snake Guards. After all, the Silvermoon Set Equipment was not just for show. Right now, Shi Feng\u2019s Agility exceeded 60 points. Even if the Twin-headed Snake Guards could defend against one of Shi Feng\u2019s attacks in time, they would still be struck by his other sword. Every sword that landed would take away 60 to 70 HP, while the occasional Critical Hit would cause over -150 damage.Shi Feng\u2019s sword strikes were like a fierce gale passing by. The sword strikes constantly landed on the two Twin-headed Snake Guards, causing their HP to fall madly. Within a few moments, the two Twin-headed Snake Guards breathed their last breaths.After looting the drops, Shi Feng rushed at the Twin-headed Snake King.Currently, the doppelganger\u2019s HP had fallen below 30%. It was exhausting itself trying to pin down the Twin-headed Snake King. The Rare Elite\u2019s attacks were extremely quick. It would, from time to time, spit out a poisonous fog, enveloping a large area with it. The doppelganger only possessed 50% of the original body\u2019s Attributes, so it could only constantly defend and escape. Otherwise, it would have long since dropped dead.However, now that the original body had arrived, the doppelganger did not need to pin down the Twin-headed Snake King any longer.Shi Feng immediately used Nine Dragons Slash, shooting out nine phantoms of the Abyssal Blade. Shi Feng then used Defensive Blade, his attack range greatly increasing.He could only attack from afar when facing the Twin-headed Snake King who was capable of spewing out poisonous fog. If he were to enter a melee with the Twin-headed Snake King, he would not last twenty seconds. Even if he were to activate all of his life-saving skills, he still would not survive.The Twin-headed Snake King was very cunning. When facing Shi Feng, one of its heads defended against Shi Feng\u2019s attacks while its other head constantly attacked his doppelganger, paying no attention to Shi Feng himself.After three to four hits, the doppelganger could no longer take it, vanishing.Meanwhile, the Twin-headed Snake King\u2019s HP was still over 70%. Its other head now turned to stare at Shi Feng. It opened its mouth, spitting out a mouthful of poison. The poison was like an arrow as it shot towards Shi Feng.Shi Feng\u2019s expression suddenly sank. His body dodged sideways, avoiding the poison.When the poisonous fluid struck a sandstone, the fluid immediately passed through, leaving behind a large hole. This was the Twin-headed Snake King\u2019s Corroding Acid. If one were to block it, though a Secret-Silver Weapon might still be fine, a Common Weapon would immediately melt. As for a Bronze Weapon, its Durability would, at least, be reduced by half and taking two hits from the Corroding Acid would turn it into scrap.In such a way, one man and one snake started maintaining their distance between each other, attacking and dodging. Shi Feng madly slashed his swords, streak after streak of sword light filling up the area. Meanwhile, the Twin-headed Snake King\u2019s two heads spat out poison without halt, leaving behind countless holes. From time to time, it would also fill a large area with a poisonous fog, leaving not even a blade of grass alive.From time to time, Shi Feng would be poisoned during battle. After over ten minutes of constant battle, even though Shi Feng was constantly drinking Basic Regeneration Potions as soon as the Cooldown was finished, his remaining HP was only at 8%. Meanwhile, the Twin-headed Snake King still had 14% of its HP remaining.Seeing as both their HPs were low, the Twin-headed Snake King revealed a sinister look. Its size faintly increased by a fold; then, suddenly, it leaped into the air. One of its heads widely opened its mouth, revealing its snow-white poisonous fangs, while its other head spewed out poisonous fog. The Twin-headed Snake King used an attack pattern that contained both attack and defense, and as long as Shi Feng closed in on it, he would be trapped in the harmful fog.\u201cGoing all out now?\u201d Currently, Shi Feng could withstand the poisonous fog for 3 seconds at best or take one strike from the Snake King itself. Hence, Shi Feng took out a bottle of Basic Regeneration Potion from his bag, gulping it down and recovering 180 HP. In his other hand, Shi Feng took out a Polymorph Scroll.Just as the Twin-headed Snake King was about to land, it was immediately turned into a sheep.Thundering Flash!Chop!Double Chop!Earth Splitter!After a series of attacks, the Twin-headed Snake King only had 5% of its HP remaining. However, it had transformed back into its original form, while its surroundings were filled with poisonous fog. The Twin-headed Snake King\u2019s recovery speed increased by a fold while inside the fog, while its enemies would madly lose their HP. Shi Feng immediately retreated, using Abyssal Bind on the Twin-headed Snake King. Shi Feng then took out the Tier 1 Magic Scroll, Continuous Flame Bombs, and started chanting.Five large Fireballs smashed onto the Twin-headed Snake King\u2019s body, taking away the last of its HP. The Twin-headed Snake King dropped four items as it died.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSystem: Twin-headed Snake King killed. Level difference of 5. EXP obtained increased by 500%. Obtained 5,000 EXP.Shi Feng finally loosened his breath. As expected, a Level 10 Rare Elite was extremely hard to deal with. If he did not possess the Silvermoon Set Equipment and the Tier 1 Magic Scroll, he would have been the one to die in this battle. Fortunately, Shi Feng killed it.Amongst the four items dropped, there was the Level 8 Mysterious-Iron Staff, Song of Life, meant for Clerics. Its overall Attributes were quite good, and it also increased the levels of Recovery Skills by +1. It was absolutely a top-tier Staff. The next item was a Level 10 Bronze Cross Shield with average Attributes. However, Shields were considered rare items, so it was already pretty good that one dropped. The final two items were the Snake King\u2019s Gall and the Snake King\u2019s Skin. Both were rare materials in making Poison and Leather Armor.The Quest Items had already been collected, so after some rest, Shi Feng returned to turn in the Quests. He obtained the rare forging materials, and his experience increased to 91% of Level 5, just a little more before reaching Level 6.Looking at the time, it was not long before the arranged meeting time. So, Shi Feng started heading towards the Level 8 area, Physis Canyon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83 \u2013 Second MeetingPhysis Canyon, a paradise on earth, it was a place filled with lush green vegetation. Multiple streams of water flowed through the canyon, while flocks of birds flew in the sky above. The forest, as well, was filled with the sounds of hundreds of birds squabbling with each other.Although this place was beautiful, right now, there was not a single player that came here to level up. After all, the highest leveled player right now was just Level 6. Normally, they would be safely leveling up in Level 6 or Level 7 areas. Physis Canyon was a Level 8 monster area, and Level 9 monsters could even be found in the inner areas. For a short period, there wouldn\u2019t be any players coming to disturb this place.More importantly, Shi Feng was here for the Unique Quest \u201cSteel Fortress Barrutia.\u201d This Quest was extremely important for him to establish his future Guild.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, the player who completed this Unique Quest, just by relying on the Quest rewards alone, increased a second-rate Guild\u2019s standing to first-rate. However, now that Shi Feng had received this Unique Quest, he would use it to benefit the Guild he would establish.After entering the canyon, Shi Feng used the Demon\u2019s Mask to alter his own appearance. He transformed the silvery-white Silvermoon Set Equipment into a suit of shining pitch black Set Equipment. It could be called the Blackmoon Set Equipment. Shi Feng also altered his face into one of an older gentleman, his age around 26 to 27. He then donned a black cloak, his face hidden within the cloak. At first glance, his appearance exuded a strong sense of mystery, allowing others to think he was a man with a story.Shi Feng\u2019s get-up was somewhat similar to the Night Ranger[1], only he had two longswords hanging on his back rather than a simple black bow. Moreover, Shi Feng was not of the Night Elf race.Now that Shi Feng had disguised himself, nobody would be able to recognize who he was. Even with Gentle Snow\u2019s discerning eyes, it was impossible for her to recognize him.Arriving at the meeting location, Shi Feng discovered Gentle Snow and her group had yet to arrive.Shi Feng called out the System Notifications, taking a look at the sales condition of the Forging Designs this time around.\u201cSold out already?\u201d Shi Feng looked at the series of notifications, his eyes almost shining.There were over ten notifications from the Auction House, and every one of them notified him that he had an increase of around 3 Gold Coins.Shi Feng auctioned a total of 20 pieces of Forging Designs, yet, they were sold at an average price of 3 Gold Coins. One could just imagine how desperate these Guilds were. However, compared to the price of 3 Gold Coins, these Guilds that bought the Forging Designs could also, very quickly, earn that money back. God\u2019s Domain had only officially started three days ago. Along with the increase in time, there would be more and more people joining God\u2019s Domain. The number of new players might even exceed that of the old players. These new players were the main consumers, and the supply Level 3 Glimmer Chestplates would be unable to meet the demand. In a short period, the value of the Glimmer Chestplate would not depreciate, and instead, its value might even increase.However, Shi Feng\u2019s goal had already been met, so he no longer planned to make more Glimmer Chestplate Forging Designs to earn money. Right now, his bag was holding over 50 Gold Coins. These Coins were the entirety of the fluid funds of more than ten large Guilds. If Shi Feng were to use all of it to operate a Guild, how formidable would this be? Unfortunately, money was not the only thing needed to operate a Guild.Shi Feng took out 20 Gold Coins and registered them on the Virtual Trade Center. After all, he couldn\u2019t just keep all those Gold Coins on hand. If he did that, he would be throwing money away. Based on the selling price right now, these 20 Gold Coins were worth 180,000 Credits.Shi Feng did not imagine things would go so smoothly. He earned so many Credits in just three short days. However, if he wanted to start a good Workshop, such a small amount of money was still insufficient.To start up Shadow Workshop, Lan Hailong invested five million Credits from the start. In the following month, he even invested over ten million Credits. One could just imagine how much money it took to start up a Workshop, not to mention a Guild with thousands or tens of thousands of members. However, after the Workshop and Guild were established, things would be greatly different.To a Guild, hundreds of thousands of Credits was nothing.Shi Feng still needed to earn a lot of money.Hence why Shi Feng had chosen to work with Gentle Snow secretly.\u201cAre you Black Flame?\u201d a voice as crisp as a jade falling to the ground came from behind Shi Feng.Shi Feng turned around, discovering Gentle Snow\u2019s beautiful figure walking over while sizing him up. Although it was their second time meeting, he was still unaccustomed to Gentle Snow\u2019s attentive gaze. In a slightly deep tone, Shi Feng said, \u201cCorrect. I am.\u201dHearing Shi Feng\u2019s answer, moreover receiving the information proving Black Flame\u2019s identity, Gentle Snow\u2019s beautiful eyes focused. She secretly used an Observation skill.Suddenly, Gentle Snow stared blankly. She was unable to discern Shi Feng\u2019s name. The information only showed him as an unknown Level 5.Gentle Snow originally thought that Black Flame only had good forging skills, many lucky encounters, superior strategies, and relatively good gaming skills. She never imagined that Black Flame\u2019s gaming skills were not just the average kind of good. He was definitely a top-tier expert. Otherwise, he would not be able to obtain such a high-grade item.Special Items that could hide a person\u2019s identity, even Ouroboros did not possess a single one of such an item. They had also never heard of any other first-rate Guilds obtaining one. Meanwhile, not only did the mysterious man in front of her possess such an item, but Gentle Snow could also feel a powerful strength emanating from the equipment he was wearing. Even though the equipment\u2019s special effects were hidden, a single glance at the equipment\u2019s delicate make and the magical markings circling it told Gentle Snow that it was a set. In fact, Black Flame\u2019s equipment might not be any worse than hers. Her equipment was obtained through the efforts of the Elite party behind her. How much time had they spent obtaining them? How did the man in front of her obtain such good equipment?Gentle Snow attentively gazed at Shi Feng. She was even starting to suspect whether or not Black Flame was a player or the leader of a mysterious organization. Otherwise, how would he possess such financial and physical resources to carry out all those tasks? His title of Chief Forger was even publicly acknowledged by the players of Star-Moon Kingdom. Just carrying out tasks such as forging and organizing would take up most of his time, so how was it possible he obtained such a good set of equipment?\u201cHello, I am called Gentle Snow, First Vice Leader of Ouroboros.\u201d Gentle Snow stretched out her jade-white hand in a very formal manner. It was different from the casual meeting when Shi Feng first met her, where she regarded Shi Feng with a superior attitude.The party members behind Gentle Snow were all shocked. They never imagined their leader would actually take the initiative to shake hands with someone else.Was this older gentleman in front of them that powerful to necessitate such formality?Zhao Yueru, who stood behind Gentle Snow, was constantly sizing up Shi Feng with her beautiful eyes. Prior to this meeting, Shi Feng\u2019s series of performances had caused her to become very interested in him. Now that she was meeting him in person, she discovered that Shi Feng\u2019s entire body was exuding a mature and calm feeling, causing others to pay attention to him inadvertently. Now that even Gentle Snow had given her approval, Zhao Yueru had a faintly better impression of him.\u201cHello, you can address me as Black Flame.\u201d Not wanting to act too aloof, Shi Feng shook hands with Gentle Snow. He discovered that her hand was very soft and smooth as expected. If Blackie were to know of this incident, he would most likely shake Shi Feng\u2019s hands, then not wash them for three days.The reason why Shi Feng did not completely alter the Silvermoon Set Equipment\u2019s appearance was to awe and intimidate them. Seeing the satisfying results, Shi Feng got right to the point and said, \u201cI have contacted you this time to cooperate with your Ouroboros. I wonder what your opinion of this is?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOf course, we welcome it very much. If you are willing to become the Chief Forger of our Ouroboros, just state your price,\u201d Gentle Snow said with confidence. She guessed that Shi Feng would demand an exorbitant price. However, as long as they could successfully poach Shi Feng, then everything would be worth it. Moreover, with her current influence, satisfying Shi Feng\u2019s appetite was no problem at all.\u201cMiss Snow, I think you are misunderstanding something here. I will not be joining your Guild. Instead, I will be using an equal status to cooperate with your Guild. If Miss Snow is unable to make this problem clear, we do not need to continue this discussion.\u201dFinished speaking, Shi Feng turned to leave.TL Notes:[1] Night Ranger: a Special Elite found in the Deathly Forest Dungeon, mentioned in Chapter 25.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84 \u2013 Horizon AllianceSeeing as Shi Feng was about to leave\u2026The members from Ouroboros were stupefied. There was actually a man who would treat Gentle Snow in such a way. He even discarded the chance to work with Ouroboros without hesitation.Zhao Yueru panicked, her words caught in her mouth. She almost wanted to hold back Shi Feng and mediate between them. Even the wise Gentle Snow had yet to speak. If Zhao Yueru took action herself, her standing out might cause the situation to worsen. So, without a better choice, she just pulled on Gentle Snow\u2019s arm, secretly reminding her.However, what Zhao Yueru did not know was that Gentle Snow was similarly stupefied.She did not imagine that Shi Feng\u2019s goal from the start was not to join Ouroboros but to cooperate with them on equal standing. However, did Shi Feng have the qualifications to do so?Ouroboros was not as simple as it looked. It was a colossus in the virtual gaming world. The resources in its possession were not something an average player could imagine. To be able to cooperate with Ouroboros with equal statuses, at the very least, they needed to be a first-rate Guild equally.On the other hand, the man before Gentle Snow wanted to cooperate with Ouroboros on equal standings as if it were a matter of course.For him to be so confident, did this man truly have some sort of hidden power standing behind him?This was also not an impossibility. Being able to carry out this series of matters, in addition to obtaining such a set of equipment, was not something a person could do within such a short period. Black Flame definitely possessed the support of a great power. That\u2019s the only way he would be capable of causing the vicious competition that was happening right now. According to their Guild\u2019s statistics, the income Black Flame obtained from selling the Forging Designs exceeded 60 Gold Coins. Meanwhile, the fluid funds of a first-rate Guild right now did not exceed even 3 Gold Coins. If this money were utilized properly, it would allow a first-rate Guild to surpass the other first-rate Guilds instantly. Becoming a Super-Guild would not be a problem.Suddenly, Gentle Snow felt chills crawl down her spine. As the Vice Leader of Ouroboros, she actually failed to notice such a great hidden power.However, for a power to be unknown to her, one could just imagine how deep this power hid. Fortunately, she was able to discover it now. Whether they were a friend or a foe remained unknown.\u201cPlease wait.\u201d Gentle Snow urged Shi Feng to stay, saying, \u201cYou, too, should know that our Ouroboros is a first-rate Guild. There are not many powers out there who possess the qualifications to work with us. If you can prove that you have the ability and capital and that your proposal would bring Ouroboros great benefits, then we can come to an agreement.\u201d\u201cHumph! Ouroboros sure does have a very big tone. You should know that the first-rate Guilds that I can choose to cooperate with aren\u2019t just limited to you.\u201d Shi Feng turned around and looked at Gentle Snow, acting as if he did not place Ouroboros in his eyes at all. Afterward, he took out one of the Level 10 Mysterious-Iron Equipment Forging Designs that he bought from Blackbeard, waving it in front of Gentle Snow\u2019s face. He then said with a sneer, \u201cI wonder what thoughts you will have after seeing this? Do you think I have enough qualifications?\u201d\u201cHow could it be?!\u201d Gentle Snow could not believe what her eyes were seeing. Her heart was filled with extreme shock, \u201cHow did you obtain a Level 10 Mysterious-Iron Forging Design?\u201dRight now, even the Level 3 Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design was being fought over insanely. The value of the Forging Design in Shi Feng\u2019s hands right now simply could not be imagined.To the Elites of a Guild, the Level 3 Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design was not particularly useful. The main purpose of a Guild obtaining it was just to earn money and nurture their own Forgers, increasing the advantage that their Guild possessed over others. However, when compared to the Forging Design that Shi Feng was currently holding, the Glimmer Chestplate Forging Design was not even worth being mentioned.Lead by one step, then lead to every other step. This was the natural law of the virtual gaming world. Every Guild knew of this law.\u201cTrade secret. Don\u2019t think too much about it.\u201d Shi Feng kept the Forging Design, \u201cIf there aren\u2019t any other matters, then I\u2019ll be leaving.\u201dIt was absolutely impossible for Gentle Snow to allow the person in front of her, who possesses a Level 10 Mysterious-Iron Equipment Forging Design, to leave. Moreover, to allow him to cooperate with another first-rate Guild. If she were to allow the other first-rate Guilds to obtain him and mass-produce these pieces of equipment, equipping every Elite member with it, then the competition for the Kingdom\u2019s Capital would no longer be necessary.\u201cAlright, I agree. State how we should cooperate then.\u201d Gentle Snow grit her teeth, yielding to Shi Feng in the end.\u201cHehe, but I don\u2019t wish to cooperate with you anymore.\u201d Shi Feng said in a deep tone.\u201cYou?!\u201d Gentle Snow\u2019s expression suddenly turned cold. However, very quickly, she calmed back down. She no longer had her high and aloof attitude, her face revealing a calm smile as she said, \u201cI apologize for my previous poor manners. I wonder if you can reconsider? Our Ouroboros is willing to pay double the price of the other Guilds.\u201dShi Feng nodded his head, saying with a smile, \u201cAlright then, seeing as you are so sincere.\u201dAfter this scene, everyone else thought that they had heard wrong. The incomparably proud Snow Goddess actually surrendered. Moreover, she even apologized for her previous behavior. How terrifying was this Black Flame?Currently, Zhao Yueru\u2019s eyes were shining as they looked at Black Flame with admiration. She knew full well how proud and intelligent Gentle Snow was. Since meeting her, Zhao Yueru had never seen a person who could make Gentle Snow apologize.\u201cI wonder how you wish to cooperate?\u201d Gentle Snow sent a glare towards the snickering Zhao Yueru behind her, then looked back at Shi Feng and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. I am planning to establish a loose Lifestyle organization called Horizon Alliance and recruit all sorts of Lifestyle players. You just need to help me advertise it and spread its influence, and I\u2019ll give your Guild a discounted price. I\u2019ll even sell you equipment and tools that are unavailable to the public,\u201d Shi Feng unhurriedly said.\u201cYou really want to establish such an organization?\u201d Gentle Snow was slightly shocked. Although she did not think highly of Shi Feng, the terms he stated were very attractive.Zhao Yueru\u2019s eyes widened in shock. She unbelievably looked at Shi Feng, feeling he was too insane.After everyone else heard Shi Feng, they all thought that Shi Feng simply had too much money to waste. He was actually trying to establish such an organization.Shi Feng\u2019s plan was truly outrageous. It was utterly impossible to unify all the Lifestyle players. The financial resources, physical resources, and manpower required to carry out such a feat were simply too great. Every Guild has been nurturing their own Lifestyle players. Moreover, they only recruited the Elites among them in order to avoid wasting resources. That meant that the leftover Lifestyle players were just mob characters, and there wouldn\u2019t be a big effect if all of them gathered together. The resources needed to nurture these Lifestyle players were even more needless. There was not a single Guild out there who was willing to bear such a price.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOf course, if it were to succeed, the profits would be truly unimaginable.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. When the time comes, I will naturally notify you to help me advertise the organization and spread its influence. In any case, you all don\u2019t have anything to lose. Of course, I will give you all some remuneration in advance. Ten Glimmer Chestplate Forging Designs should be enough for your Guild to nurture quite a few Forgers.\u201d If Shi Feng were to advertise the organization himself, not to mention how much time it would waste, the effects would not be that great. He would need a lot of time to increase the organization\u2019s influence. However, it was a different story if Ouroboros were the ones advertising the organization. They could practically cover the entire Star-Moon Kingdom, greatly shortening the process of gathering influence.Gentle Snow gave Shi Feng\u2019s offer some thought. It was not much work for them to do the advertising. They could also obtain ten Glimmer Chestplate Forging Designs now, allowing them to widen the gap between Ouroboros and the other Guilds. They would also be able to nurture a large batch of Lifestyle players, earning even more Coins. As for the matter of establishing such a Lifestyle Alliance, nurturing Lifestyle players in large batches meant it was a process of constantly spending money. It wouldn\u2019t be long before such a plan would collapse. Nurturing Lifestyle players was an extremely tough task. If Shi Feng did not possess the resource and financial support from a large Guild, it would be very hard for him to obtain any achievements.Following which, Gentle Snow signed a contract with Shi Feng, stating that she was willing to help Shi Feng spread his organization\u2019s influence throughout the entire Star-Moon Kingdom. After doing so, Shi Feng must repay her with a hundred pieces of Level 10 Mysterious-Iron Equipment. At the same time, Ouroboros will be able to purchase equipment and tools from Shi Feng at the discounted price.Gentle Snow looked rather happy after receiving the ten Glimmer Chestplate Forging Designs. She passed the Forging Designs to an Assassin, letting him take the Forging Designs back to the Guild. Then, she looked towards Shi Feng, inviting him, \u201cI see that the number of Humanoid Monsters is quite high here. Although their levels are slightly higher, it is a good place to level up. Why don\u2019t you level up with us? It would be much faster than leveling up by yourself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85 \u2013 BirdmanGentle Snow\u2019s invite caused both Zhao Yueru and Xiao Yue\u2019er to pay attention.Shi Feng\u2019s strength must definitely be great. However, they have never specifically seen him in action, so they were extremely curious about his capabilities. They wanted to experience the strength of the rumored Chief Forger of Star-Moon Kingdom.\u201cRight! Join our party, Big Brother Black Flame! Our party members are all very skilled, so our leveling efficiency will be a lot higher,\u201d Xiao Yue\u2019er said from the side.Zhao Yueru sent a glare towards Xiao Yue\u2019er. The girl actually made the statement before she could.Xiao Yue\u2019er hid behind Gentle Snow, cutely sticking her little tongue out at Zhao Yueru.Zhao Yueru stamped her feet in anger, causing her chest to bounce indefinitely. If it were not for Black Flame being present, she would have taught this little girl a lesson right this instant.Although the beauties were filled with interest in Shi Feng\u2019s strength, the remaining two male players had their fighting spirits raised instead. Just what did Shi Feng possess to earn the attention of the three beauties? Suddenly, a heart of competition grew within them. They looked at Shi Feng with a provocative expression, not believing that they were any worse than Shi Feng.Regarding these provocative glances, Shi Feng paid no attention to them. He said in a low tone, \u201cThank you for your kind intentions, Miss Snow. However, I have a Quest that I need to do here, so I can\u2019t level up with everyone.\u201d\u201cA Quest, is it?\u201d Gentle Snow was slightly shocked. This place was a Level 8 monster area, so she was extremely curious about this Quest Shi Feng possessed. However, trying to ask about someone else\u2019s secret would be impolite, so she formally said, \u201cThen, we won\u2019t disturb you anymore. If you need help, just ask. Although we don\u2019t know how much help we could be, we will still try our best to assist you.\u201dShi Feng smiled faintly when he heard Gentle Snow\u2019s offer. It was naturally good news that there was someone willing to help him. It would not be an easy task entering the Steel Fortress Barrutia. There would definitely be monsters there, and it would take Shi Feng a long time to deal with them by himself. If there were such a powerful party helping him, then he would be able to save a lot of time.\u201cThat\u2019s great! I need to go to a certain place. However, there are a lot of monsters there, so it won\u2019t be easy for me to enter by myself. Can you all help me clear the area?\u201d Shi Feng implored.Originally, Gentle Snow was still thinking of a way to deepen the relationship between them and Shi Feng. Never would she have thought that Shi Feng would actually take the initiative to ask them for help. Gentle Snow quickly said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll invite you to the party. You lead the way.\u201dShi Feng accepted the invite, joining Gentle Snow\u2019s party.Under Shi Feng\u2019s guidance, the party of players quickly arrived at the core region of Physis Canyon.\u201cWe\u2019ll arrive after passing through this forest. However, the number of Birdmen here is very high. They are all living up in the trees and are hard to detect, so you all have to pay attention to the Birdmen descending at any time. If they catch you in their talons, they will carry you high up into the air, then throw you your death,\u201d Shi Feng informed as he walked.\u201cIt\u2019s just a bunch of Birdmen. What\u2019s there to be afraid of? Watch how we\u2019ll take care of these Birdmen,\u201d the Shield Warrior of the party clapped his chest, speaking in a disdainful tone.Shi Feng spoke no more, only silently pushed aside the tree leaves that hindered his path.However, Gentle Snow was not careless. Instead, she commanded, \u201cEveryone, pay attention to the air above. Protect the healer.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe two male players immediately turned serious, not daring to be careless. They tightly guarded Xiao Yue\u2019er\u2019s sides. As long as Xiao Yue\u2019er survived, she would be able to revive them after leaving the battle. That way, the EXP and skill proficiency lost would be massively reduced.As expected, not a moment later, four white-feathered Birdmen descended from the treetops. The sharp talons on both of their feet shot down with shocking speed, like an eagle hunting its prey, catching the male Ranger in an instant. The remaining party members reacted quickly, either using their weapons to block the talons or avoiding them completely.\u201cGet rid of them! Yueru, attack the Birdman that caught Little Song! Yue\u2019er, stay in the back!\u201d Gentle Snow shouted orders. She used Whirlwind Slash on two Birdmen; however, the two Birdmen reacted very quickly, avoiding the attack by flying up into the air. Following which, Gentle Snow used Charge, running to save the male Ranger named Little Song.Although the twin daggers in Little Song\u2019s hands constantly retaliated, the talons of the Birdman were too hard. No matter what he did, he could not hack away the talons gripping his shoulders. Although he wanted to attack the Birdman directly, his position prevented him from landing a hit on the monster\u2019s body. He could only helplessly dangle, slowly rising into the air.Zhao Yueru used a Flame Explosion on the Level 9 Birdman\u2019s wings, causing -53 damage. The flames burned away some of the Birdman\u2019s feathers, causing the Birdman to plummet from the sky instantly. Gentle Snow was already waiting down below by the time the Birdman landed. She directed a Cleave at the Birdman\u2019s neck, sending the Birdman and its prey flying with the attack and causing -61 damage.Facing the Level 9 Birdman, Zhao Yueru and Gentle Snow dealing such a high amount of damage despite the level difference of 4 Levels was quite good.The injured Birdman looked pitiful. However, Birdmen had a total of 1,000 HP. Just this amount of damage was nothing to it. It would be better again after rubbing some spit on its wounds.Moreover, it was the first time Gentle Snow and the others dealt with the attack patterns of flying monsters. They did not know any effective attack patterns and battle techniques.Although Gentle Snow\u2019s party managed to save the Ranger, they were still at a disadvantage against the four Birdmen hovering in the sky. Aside from Gentle Snow and Zhao Yueru, who managed to deal over 50 damage to the Birdmen, the damages dealt by the Ranger and the Shield Warrior did not exceed 20. However, it was not because they were weak, but because the Birdmen were wearing Leather Armor; their Defense was not low. In addition to the level suppression, the two male players would be unable to deal any significant damage.\u201cWhat is this brat trying to do? He still hasn\u2019t helped out after all this time. He is even watching from the side. Is he just a paper tiger!?\u201d the Shield Warrior, unable to stand by idly and watch, ridiculed Shi Feng in a soft tone.However, just as the Shield Warrior finished speaking, Shi Feng took action.With an abrupt leap, Shi Feng jumped past the trees, arriving in the treetops. Now that Shi Feng\u2019s Agility had reached 40 points, in addition to activating the Hidden Skill, Flying Steps, he was able to leap around the treetops effortlessly like a martial arts expert. His swords then landed on the Birdmen flying in midair, one after another.Every slash from Shi Feng\u2019s swords caused -160 damage, at least triple the amount of what Gentle Snow and the others dealt.This caused the Shield Warrior and Ranger to shut their mouths immediately.Xiao Yue\u2019er watched Shi Feng leaping around the forest with a face filled with admiration, both her eyes glistening radiantly.Zhao Yueru, as well, was slightly captivated. Black Flame was definitely not like some person who had dog-shit luck.Only Gentle Snow remained very calm. However, Shi Feng\u2019s way of battle had truly given her some enlightenment. She felt that her previous ways of battling were inflexible, unable to accommodate different situations. However, she was not to blame for this. The previous virtual reality games that were available did not contain such a flexible battle styles. It would not be easy for her to change in such a short period.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA short moment later, four of the hovering Birdmen fell dead. Their bodies fell heavily to the ground, dropping several Copper Coins and some Light Feathers.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Shi Feng sheathed his pair of swords after landing on the ground. He then walked in the direction of his destination.\u201cBig Brother Black Flame, don\u2019t walk so quickly! Teach me how to battle as well, alright?\u201d Xiao Yue\u2019er excitedly chased after Shi Feng, hugging Shi Feng\u2019s arm and shaking it.\u201cThis is a technique for Melee Jobs. You don\u2019t need to learn it as a Cleric.\u201d Shi Feng did not think that Xiao Yue\u2019er would be so easy-going and unrestrained. She was completely different from the distinguished person she would be several years later.\u201cYou little girl! Just a moment and you\u2019re already making trouble! Didn\u2019t Big Brother Black Flame already say it? You\u2019re not suited for it!\u201d Zhao Yueru pulled Xiao Yue\u2019er away, panting in rage. Unconsciously, the way she referred to Shi Feng had changed as well, suddenly becoming much more intimate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86 \u2013 Mechanical ArmyWatching Shi Feng\u2019s back, Gentle Snow grit her teeth. When she thought about the horrifying amount of damage Shi Feng previously dealt and his extraordinary battle methods, she suddenly felt Shi Feng was even more opaque to her than before.She knew all of the top-tier experts in the virtual gaming world. However, she had never heard of a top-tier expert such as Black Flame.The equipment she was currently wearing could be considered the pinnacle amongst the current players. Both she and Shi Feng were Level 5, as well. However, the difference in their damage was actually so large. Just how excellent was Shi Feng\u2019s equipment? Could it be that he was wearing a full set of Level 5 Mysterious-Iron Set Equipment?What Gentle Snow did not know was that the Silvermoon Set Equipment Shi Feng wore was the best Set Equipment for Swordsmen below Level 10. Its Attributes were much better than Level 5 Mysterious-Iron Set Equipment. In addition, Shi Feng possessed a Magic Weapon and a Secret-Silver Weapon. Also, because of the effects of the Abyssal Blade, Shi Feng could deal damage to the Birdmen while ignoring the level suppression. So, his damage would naturally be extremely high.On their way through the forest, the number of Birdmen they met constantly grew. However, even if they were to face more than ten Birdmen at a time, these Birdmen would still be killed off very quickly. Such a result was because of Shi Feng\u2019s horrifying damage in addition to the Shield Warrior holding off the monsters and Gentle Snow and the others becoming more familiar with the battles.The leveling efficiency of Gentle Snow\u2019s party right now was much higher than before Shi Feng joined them.Half an hour later, Shi Feng and the others finally arrived at the Ruined Lands.Although it was called the Ruined Lands, in reality, it was just a gigantic crater. Cave systems of various depths and sizes could be found inside the crater. If one entered deep into a cave, they would easily become lost within it.\u201cBig Brother Black Flame, is this the place where you have to do your Quest?\u201d Zhao Yueru moved closer to Shi Feng\u2019s side, flipping her fine black hair and asking in a soft tone.After being in such a close range with the Witch, Zhao Yueru, and seeing deep cleavage revealed by her red robes, it was impossible for Shi Feng not to have thoughts about it. Even if he did not possess any evil intentions, it became much harder for him to pretend to be profound now.\u201cEn. We\u2019ll reach it once we go down this path. However, there are too many Birdmen circling in the sky, so won\u2019t be easy to get over there.\u201d Shi Feng deliberately shifted his gaze to a side, watching the sky above the canyon that led towards the large crater.The Shield Warrior and Ranger no longer belittled Shi Feng\u2019s reminder this time. Instead, they held a hint of reverence towards Shi Feng now. Taking precautions, they looked towards the Birdmen in the sky. On the way to this place, it was only thanks to Shi Feng that the two of them did not end up dead.Watching Shi Feng take the first step, entering the narrow canyon, a faint smile appeared on Zhao Yueru\u2019s face. She kept on having a familiar feeling when she looked at Shi Feng. This was the first time she felt this sort of sensation. Soon after, Zhao Yueru followed Shi Feng tightly into the canyon.Gentle Snow only smiled sweetly at this scene. How could she not know Zhao Yueru\u2019s thoughts? There were extremely few situations where Zhao Yueru was interested in a man in such a way. Of course, if Zhao Yueru could enchant Shi Feng, pulling him into Ouroboros, that, too, would be advantageous.Although there were a lot of Birdmen in the canyon, Gentle Snow\u2019s party had become increasingly familiar with dealing with these monsters.It was especially true for Gentle Snow. She was a genius. She had already learned Shi Feng\u2019s battle methods after only seeing them a few times. She used the cliff walls to jump back and forth, and every time she brandished her blade, she would strike a Birdman from the air, sending it to the ground. Moreover, she was able to dodge and avoid the talons and fierce attacks of the Birdmen in midair. Even without Shi Feng\u2019s help, Gentle Snow\u2019s party could get rid of all theses Birdmen.After continuously killing several hundred Birdmen, a flash of golden light appeared around Shi Feng\u2019s body. He had finally reached Level 6, catching up to those leveling madmen.In order to equip the Dark Pursuer\u2019s Cape a little earlier, Shi Feng placed all of his Attribute Points into Agility. If he were to level up the Abyssal Blade to Level 5, he might even be able to equip the Dark Pursuer\u2019s Cape at Level 8.\u201cHe\u2019s Level 6 already?\u201d Gentle Snow looked over at Shi Feng. She did not imagine that his leveling speed would be so swift. She had been killing monsters to level up without stop, yet, she was currently still 23% away from reaching Level 6. Meanwhile, Shi Feng clearly busied himself with a variety of things, yet, he could still reach Level 6 before her.However, when she thought about how Shi Feng could kill monsters of a higher level with such ease, it was no wonder he could level up so quickly.\u201cYou want to go to that place? The number of monsters there is just too high. Amongst them, there are even quite a lot of Level 9 Elites and Level 10 Special Elites. Are you sure you want to enter?\u201d After arriving at the deeper regions of the large crater, Gentle Snow suddenly discovered that the place was filled with wandering Mechanical Golems. She could not figure out just what kind of Quest Shi Feng had received that actually had such a high difficulty. Even if Shi Feng were even more powerful than he was now, it was absolutely impossible for him to enter that place.The Mechanical Golems were around a person\u2019s height.[Mechanical Golem] (Common Monster)Level 9HP 1,500/1,500The Mechanical Warriors were double the size of the Mechanical Golems, and their hands were holding a blade and shield.[Mechanical Warrior] (Elite Monster)Level 9HP 3,000/3,000The Mechanical Knights were the most terrifying of them all. They rode Mechanical Horses, and they held long pikes. They were over 6 meters tall, just like a two-storied building.[Mechanical Knight] (Special Elite)Level 10HP 7,000/7,000In the deepest parts of this horde of Mechanical monsters, there was a pair of tightly shut steel gates. However, the number of Mechanical Puppets and Mechanical Warriors was just too ridiculous. Just from a simple glance, Gentle Snow estimated over 800 of them. Moreover, in the deepest parts, there were over a hundred Mechanical Knights tightly guarding the front of the steel gates. Clearing all of those Mechanical Knights without a thousand-man Elite army was only a pipe dream.The amount of these Mechanical monsters simply caused one despair. Even being more than a hundred yards away from these Mechanical monsters frightened Zhao Yueru and the others.The Mechanical army would be unparalleled if they were to rush over altogether. The army would be able to annihilate Zhao Yueru and the others instantly.\u201cBig Brother Black Flame, are you really going to go? You will definitely die.\u201d Even though Zhao Yueru was confident in her party\u2019s strength, just based on the standards of their Level 5 party, clearing the surrounding Mechanical Golems and Mechanical Warriors was already a huge problem, not to mention the Mechanical Knights. A single Mechanical Knight might be enough to get rid of them all, let alone facing a hundred of them.\u201cEh, I must go there. However, we need to clear these Golems and Warriors, which are just hindrances, first,\u201d Shi Feng nodded his head.\u201cThen, let\u2019s slowly lure them over and kill them, clearing the way bit by bit.\u201d Gentle Snow had already promised Shi Feng that they would spare no effort in helping him. Naturally, she would not shrink back now. Moreover, this place was quite good for leveling up. After killing so many Birdmen on the way here, they gained quite a lot of Common Equipment and materials. If they were to clear all these Mechanical Warriors, their gains should be even greater. It was just that the strength of the Mechanical Warriors was still an unknown to them.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll lure them over one by one,\u201d Zhao Yueru volunteered. It was easiest for a ranged player to lure monsters. Moreover, based on her skills, even if the monsters were tightly packed together, she would still be able to lure only two to three of them over. Their party would also be able to dispose of the monsters easily.\u201cHold on,\u201d Shi Feng suddenly pulled Zhao Yueru back.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Zhao Yueru asked.The others looked towards Shi Feng, puzzled. Could it be that Shi Feng did not believe in Zhao Yueru\u2019s skills?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Feng was very clear with the difficulty of this place. However, Zhao Yueru and the others did not know that these Mechanical monsters were all weapons of war made by the Dwarven civilization. If Zhao Yueru were to go and lure the monsters without knowing this, it would only lead to a party-wipe.\u201cThe Mechanical monsters are extremely troublesome to deal with. Their agro range is extremely wide. There is no need to mention their Defense and Attack Power. If you were to try and lure one, at least ten more would follow. With the level suppression, we will definitely be unable to take on that many of them at once. I have another idea. Which one of you here has a Movement Speed of over 14 points?\u201d\u201cMy Movement Speed is 17. Little Song has also reached 14 points,\u201d Gentle Snow answered even though she did not understand why Shi Feng asked such a question.\u201cYou and Little Song both use a Speed Scroll. In a moment, lure all of the surrounding Mechanical monsters and gather them in a single location. Then, leave the rest to me.\u201d Shi Feng took out two Speed Scrolls. With these items, based on the Mechanical monsters\u2019 speed, the Mechanical monsters would definitely be unable to catch up to the two of them.After associating with Shi Feng for some time, Gentle Snow knew that Shi Feng was not one to spout nonsense. He definitely must have his own reasonings. Hence, she and Little Song both used the Speed Scrolls, the two of them starting to lure the monsters from both sides.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87 \u2013 Flame Blade DanceGentle Snow and Little Song started luring monsters from two sides. Before they even came close to the 30-yard range, the monsters discovered the two of them. The monsters\u2019 eyes flashed a red glow, all of them turning their heads and staring at the intruders.\u201cAlert! Alert! Intruders detected!\u201dAfter the alarm rang out, all of the Mechanical Golems and Mechanical Warriors within a 40-yard radius were alerted. The surrounding Mechanical monsters locked onto the two players, and within a moment, the two were being chased by hundreds of Mechanical Golems and Mechanical Warriors.Zhao Yueru was secretly shocked at seeing this. Fortunately, she did not rashly act and lure the monsters. Otherwise, they would definitely party-wipe.\u201cBig Brother Black Flame, there won\u2019t be a problem luring the monsters in such a way, right?\u201d Zhao Yueru saw that Gentle Snow and Little Song were both being chased closely after by the Mechanical army. If they had not run away in time, they might have already been dead by now.\u201cRelax. With the Speed Scroll in effect, these Mechanical monsters won\u2019t be able to catch up to them,\u201d Shi Feng said confidently.After some time, as expected, not a single one of the Mechanical monsters caught up to the two. Everything happened just as Shi Feng predicted. After luring all the surrounding Mechanical monsters, the two of them circled the large, empty crater, while the Mechanical Golems and Mechanical Warriors chased them without stop.The two of them were very adept at luring monsters. Within a short moment, they had merged the two waves of Mechanical monsters into a single wave.Inwardly, Zhao Yueru was speechless. She, too, had a Speed Scroll. However, this item was just too expensive. Even if it was her party members, each of them only possessed one Speed Scroll for the purpose of saving their own lives. She never imagined that Shi Feng could easily take out two of them. Moreover, he was only using it to lure monsters. It was truly an extravagant use.However, it was true that, with this added Speed Scroll, the two of them were able to lure all of the monsters safely.Now, though, the real problem had arrived. After luring so many monsters, how were they going to deal with them?They did not possess any AOE magic, and even if they did, they would not dare to use it. Doing so would cause disorder to the control of Hatred, as their MT did not learn an advanced skill such as Crowd Mock. At that time, everyone would just die.Shi Feng naturally knew the question everyone was thinking. However, he only revealed a mysterious smile as he walked forward.\u201cIn ten seconds, both of you lure all the monsters to the center,\u201d Shi Feng said in the party chat.\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Gentle Snow answered.Finished speaking, Shi Feng took out a delicate, dark red scroll, then spreading it open in one go. Incantations were written throughout the inside of the scroll. Just the light coming from the incantations was enough to cause the fire mana in the surroundings to surge.After seeing this, even an amateur would know that the item Shi Feng took out was not simple.As an Elementalist, Zhao Yueru\u2019s face was filled with shock. Just what kind of Magic Scroll was this? The Magic Scrolls sold by the Magic Shops were definitely unable to create such a feat. Just the incantations alone were enough to cause the fire mana of the surrounding area to gather quickly, becoming incomparably violent.Such a gathering of fire mana was even stronger than the Fire Dragon\u2019s Roar she used by several times. If Shi Feng were to release it, who knew how strong it would be?At this moment, Shi Feng activated the Magic Scroll and pulled out the Abyssal Blade.Suddenly, the fire mana collected above the Magic Scroll poured down like mercury, and streak after streak of flames over ten meters in length penetrated the Abyssal Blade. Magnificent flames then burst out of the Abyssal Blade\u2019s form, suddenly transforming into a sword of flame. It faintly released the cry of a phoenix, resounding throughout the surroundings.Naturally, everyone noticed such a vast and mighty power.Nobody thought Shi Feng would actually still have such a hidden ace in the hole.In fact, Shi Feng did not wish to use this Tier 2 Magic Scroll. He would have one less after every use. Moreover, Shi Feng had only harvested four such items from all of Moonlight Forest. Now that he had used one, he only had three remaining.At this time, Gentle Snow and Little Song had already lured all of the Mechanical monsters to the central region of the crater. They then ran towards Shi Feng.The Mechanical monsters were coming in closer and closer, 40 yards\u2026 30 yards\u2026 20 yards\u2026 10 yards\u2026 However, Shi Feng had still not taken any action. He was only standing there, silently, with his hand holding the dazzling and burning-hot sword.Just as Gentle Snow and Little Song ran past Shi Feng, Shi Feng abruptly took action, slashing out his burning blade.Tier 2 Magic, Flame Blade Dance!In the blink of an eye, Shi Feng\u2019s slash released countless crimson flames. The scorching flames were like an ocean, instantly swallowing the entire Mechanical army. The cone-shaped flames burned everything in a 60-yard distance to ash.Even if the Mechanical Warriors had 3,000 HP, they were still unable to withstand the damage from this move as they all turned into a pile of scrap metal.Meanwhile, Shi Feng\u2019s experience abruptly increased by a large chunk, rising to 37% of Level 6. The other party members had also broken through from Level 5, one after another, all of them reaching Level 6. Their leveling speed was just too awesome.Everyone\u2019s gazes then went towards the loot littering the ground, joy immediately rushing up to their heads. Shi Feng was just too awesome! He used a single move to kill Level 9 Elite monsters instantly. Although he depended on an external item to do so, being able to obtain such an item was still proof of his ability.If they were to go through this process again several more times, they would be able to reach Level 10 at any minute!At this moment, Gentle Snow, as well, was rejoicing at her choice to aid Shi Feng in his Quest. Just the EXP they obtained alone profited them big time.\u201cBig Brother Black Flame, what kind of Scroll did you use? It was actually so powerful,\u201d Zhao Yueru blinked her eyes at Shi Feng, asking curiously.\u201cA Tier 2 Magic Scroll,\u201d Shi Feng casually said.\u201cBig Brother Black Flame, where can I buy it?\u201d Zhao Yueru was captivated by the this Magic Scroll after seeing its destructive capabilities. It would be worth it even if she had to spend 10 Silver Coins to buy one.Shi Feng shook his head, saying with a smile, \u201cThis item can\u2019t be bought. It will only appear by chance when opening a high-grade Treasure Chest.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Zhao Yueru was slightly disappointed.Shi Feng might have spat out blood if he knew Zhao Yueru thought of buying the Tier 2 Magic Scroll for only 10 Silver Coins.Nobody would sell a Tier 2 Magic Scroll. That was because this item was just too valuable. If used at a crucial point, it was possible to create a comeback situation. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, there were many large Guilds who offered two to three Gold Coins for Tier 2 Magic Scrolls but still failed to purchase any.If it were not due to the importance of this Quest, Shi Feng would not have been willing to use this Scroll.Gentle Snow originally wished to find out more about the Magic Scroll, as this item was truly too useful. However, after hearing Shi Feng\u2019s tone, it was clear that he was feeling heartache over having used the item. Even the rich and overbearing Chief Forger was feeling heartache. One could just imagine how rare this item was.However, when Gentle Snow heard that she could obtain such an item from a high-grade Treasure Chest, she thought to herself that she would let the players from her Guild make a note of it.Following which, everyone else started cleaning up the loot. There were plenty of Elite monsters amongst the over eight hundred Mechanical monsters, so there were many items dropped. Amongst them, there was no lack of Level 7 to Level 8 Common Equipment. There were even over thirty pieces of Bronze Equipment and several skill books.\u201cYou killed all these monsters, and we were not of much help. So, we won\u2019t be taking any of the equipment or skill books.\u201d Gentle Snow traded all the items to Shi Feng after she finished arranging the loot.However, the Shield Warrior started drooling when he looked at all the equipment for MTs. He was extremely reluctant to part with them. However, he also did not dare have any objections to give everything to Shi Feng.\u201cYou all helped out quite a lot. Let\u2019s split according to Job requirements. As for these skill books, I\u2019ll be taking them.\u201d Shi Feng only kept all of the skill books because he discovered a special skill, Precision Throw, amongst them. This skill was extremely useful to him. As for the Bronze Equipment, they were worth but a few Gold Coins, so they were not as valuable to him. The equipment he was currently wearing was the Silvermoon Set Equipment. Shi Feng did not plan on changing equipment while he was below Level 10. As for Blackie and the others, he would obtain equipment that would better suit them.Although the equipment did not serve much purpose to Shi Feng, they were very useful to Gentle Snow.\u201cI would feel embarrassed if I were to accept them vainly. How about I purchase all of them? I currently don\u2019t have enough game Coins on hand. Could I pay using Credits?\u201d Gentle Snow, not wishing to owe Shi Feng a favor, softly asked.\u201cPaying with Credits is fine as well,\u201d Shi Feng was naturally very willing.In a short moment, Gentle Snow had transferred 50,000 Credits to Shi Feng, enriching Shi Feng quite a lot once more.\u201cWhat about the remaining Mechanical Knights? Are you going to use a Magic Scroll again?\u201d Gentle Snow looked towards the over a hundred Mechanical Knights guarding the large gate, asking in anticipation.\u201cA Tier 2 Magic Scroll can\u2019t get rid of them. Moreover, I don\u2019t need to kill them to enter into that place. I just need to lure them away.\u201d When Shi Feng heard Gentle Snow saying so, his forehead couldn\u2019t help but sweat. Tier 2 Magic Scrolls weren\u2019t just some kind of cabbage he could waste.\u201cLeave it to me, then.\u201d Gentle Snow looked at the terrain and entered into deep thought. She felt that there should be no problem in accomplishing the task.\u201cHere are some Speed Scrolls and Return Scrolls. As long as you run out of the crater, they will not continue chasing. After leaving the battle, you all can use the Return Scrolls to leave this place,\u201d Shi Feng explained and took out several Scrolls.Seeing that they were about to part from each other, Zhao Yueru felt unwillingness in her heart. She did not know why, but she could feel a sense of ease and security when she was with Shi Feng.\u201cBig Brother Black Flame, let\u2019s add each other as friends! We\u2019re going to enter a Level 5 Dungeon tomorrow, so how about you come and join us?\u201d Zhao Yueru suddenly said.Gentle Snow was faintly astonished. She looked at Zhao Yueru with a helpless smile. However, she felt that this was not really a bad choice. With Shi Feng around, their chances of clearing the Level 5 Dungeon would be even greater.\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Shi Feng did not think that this Witch would actually want to add him as a friend. Moreover, she even invited him to dive into a Dungeon. This behavior of hers right now was just way too different from before.\u201cWe can add each other as friends, but I have some things to do tomorrow. We\u2019ll dive into a Dungeon together when I have time in the future,\u201d Shi Feng tactically rejected the invitation. After all, he couldn\u2019t suddenly multiply himself into two people. As for the matter of adding each other as friends, Shi Feng possessed another independent circle of friends after donning the Demon Mask. So, others would not be able to discover any issues.\u201cLet us add each other as friends then,\u201d Zhao Yueru softly bit her lips. She was slightly disappointed that she would not be able to dive into a Dungeon with Shi Feng immediately. However, it was still good that she could add him as a friend. She would be able to contact him more easily in the future.System: Do you wish to accept Flaming Moon\u2019s friend request?Shi Feng hit accept, and the name Flaming Moon entered Black Flame\u2019s Friend Window.Afterward, Shi Feng headed towards the left side of the gate.At this moment, Gentle Snow had already arrived at the gate\u2019s right side, prepared to lure the Mechanical Knights.\u201cElder Sister Yueru, let us leave first. We can just leave the rest to Elder Sister Snow,\u201d Xiao Yue\u2019er softly said when she noticed that Zhao Yueru remained motionless.\u201cI got it.\u201d Zhao Yueru, after taking another glance at Shi Feng\u2019s back, turned around and left.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing that Shi Feng was ready, Gentle Snow activated the Speed Scroll and rushed at the Level 10 Mechanical Knights.Halfway there, the eyes of Mechanical Knights in front of the large gate shone brightly. Their enormous bodies started moving, and all of them had their eyes focused on Gentle Snow. Gentle Snow immediately halted her steps. She then turned around and escaped.The Mechanical Knights bellowed in rage as they moved their large figures, chasing after Gentle Snow.Only when all of the Mechanical Knights left did Shi Feng hastily run towards the large steel gates.Although Gentle Snow had lured the Mechanical Knights away, the amount of time they could be lured was limited. Moreover, they would not fall for the same trick the next time, so Shi Feng had to seize the opportunity.Arriving at the large gate, Shi Feng found a moss-covered keyhole. He then inserted the broken obsidian crystal given to him by Blackbeard. The fortress\u2019 key had already been stored away for almost a millennium. Blackbeard also mentioned that the key might not be able to open the gates. However, it was still worth a try.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88 \u2013 Advancing to Intermediate RankAfter inserting the obsidian key, there was no reaction from the steel gate. It was still as unmoving as ever.At this moment, a message arrived from Gentle Snow. She told Shi Feng that the Mechanical Knights had suddenly stopped chasing her and were quickly returning.\u201cCrap, it can\u2019t be, right? The key really doesn\u2019t work?\u201d In a fit of rage, Shi Feng abruptly sent a punch towards the keyhole.Since he could not use the simplest way to enter, then he could only use the more dangerous method to enter.Di\u2026 Di\u2026 Di\u2026Suddenly, a dazzling golden light radiated out from the keyhole. Countless energy runes flashed on the pair of three-storied gates. After which, the gates slowly opened, letting out ear-piercing creaking sounds.Seeing that the Mechanical Knights had already hurried over, while a gap fit for a person had opened between the pair of gates\u2026Without hesitation, Shi Feng pulled out the obsidian key, and the gates stopped moving instantly. Following which, Shi Feng squeezed himself through the gap between the gates.System: You have discovered the Steel Fortress Barrutia.The two-storied tall Mechanical Knights tried to rush in through the gates. However, the gap between the gates was just too narrow for them to pass through. In addition to the gate\u2019s immense weight, the Mechanical Knights could only bombard attacks at the gate outside. Unfortunately, their actions were not one bit useful.\u201cI\u2019m inside.\u201d After Shi Feng sent a message to Gentle Snow, he carefully headed forward along the gigantic steel pathway.On the other side of the Ruined Lands\u2026\u201cSnow, how is he?\u201d waiting by the side, Zhao Yueru asked when she saw Gentle Snow running in her direction.\u201cNo problems. He\u2019s already inside.\u201cHowever, this Quest is truly dangerous. I\u2019ve roughly estimated the Mechanical Knight\u2019s strength just now, and I\u2019ve discovered that these Mechanical Knights are completely different than other Special Elites. They can swiftly block my attacks, in addition to instantly returning with a counter attack. If it wasn\u2019t for my quick reaction, I might have died just now.\u201d\u201cIf we do not possess a skill that could continuously deal large amounts of damage, even if we could kite them around, we would still be helpless against these Mechanical Knights. Instead, we would just be piling up our own corpses.\u201d Gentle Snow sat down and took out some refreshments, eating and drinking to recover. Currently, her mind filled with the battle scenes from before. It was truly a thrilling situation. Just by receiving the shockwave, which resulted from the Mechanical Knight\u2019s pike striking the ground, she lost over 200 HP. If the weapon hit her directly, the consequences would be inconceivable.After listening to Gentle Snow\u2019s words, for reasons unknown, Zhao Yueru released a relieved breath.\u201cAlright, stop dreaming. We\u2019ll be grinding Birdmen in the canyon. The loot and experience here are quite good, so we should be able to quickly surpass those top-tier experts,\u201d After recovering, Gentle Snow stood up and commanded.Meanwhile, inside the Steel Fortress, Shi Feng was advancing carefully. Signs of rust and corrosion covered every inch inside the fortress. There were only flashing fragments of light inside, barely allowing Shi Feng to see the path clearly.After walking for quite some distance, Shi Feng did not discover any danger. There was only the occasional sound of dripping water and the rumbling sounds of machines operating. Even though more than a millennium had passed, a majority of the machinery here still functioned normally. One could clearly see just how advanced the techniques the Dwarven civilization possessed were.After passing through the large hallway, Shi Feng arrived at an area with a humongous smelting furnace. The surrounding steel walls around the furnace were linked together with steel stairs, and at the bottom of the furnace was an endlessly deep pool of water.However, Shi Feng did not head along the stairs towards the next exit. Instead, he leaped and jumped towards the pool.Halfway down, Shi Feng activated Gravity Liberation. His falling speed sharply reduced, his body slowly descending like a feather.During his descent, Shi Feng suddenly noticed a passage on the walls. The passage could barely allow a person to enter. However, the information Shi Feng had collected in his previous life did not mention such a passage. Hence, Shi Feng slowly floated over, accurately landing in the hidden passageway.\u201cThere is actually a Treasure Chest here! Did none of those people notice it last time?\u201d Shi Feng discovered that, in the deepest part of the passageway, there was a large pitch black steel chest. Many runes were carved onto the chest, and a glance was enough to tell it was not just a simple chest.After observing it in detail, Shi Feng determined that the chest was a Mysterious-Iron Treasure Chest. However, Shi Feng did not rush to open the Treasure Chest. Instead, he used Phantom Kill, allowing his doppelganger to go over and take a look.Just as the doppelganger started activating the Treasure Chest, the surrounding steel walls shot out countless flying arrows. The doppelganger was killed in an instant, giving Shi Feng a scare. Fortunately, Shi Feng had made it a habit to be cautious and prudent when in God\u2019s Domain. Otherwise, he would have really died.Such types of traps were normally one-time uses. However, Shi Feng did not rush. In any case, the chest wouldn\u2019t run away, so he might as well wait until Phantom Kill\u2019s Cooldown finished, then use his doppelganger to open the Treasure Chest.This time, the doppelganger had managed to open the Treasure Chest safely. With no more dangers present, Shi Feng walked over to the Chest and took out its contents.Inside, there was a Mysterious-Iron ranked Blackstone Shield. It was absolutely a top-tier Level 10 Shield.[Blackstone Shield] (Mysterious-Iron Rank) Level 10Equipment Requirement: Strength 25Defense +69Defend Rate 29%Strength +7, Endurance +10HP +200After equipping, all damage received from the front will be reduced by 10%.There was also a Mysterious-Iron Mastery Book. When used, players would randomly receive 10 to 50 Free Mastery Points. This item was several times rarer than the Blackstone Shield. That was because Mastery Points could last a player forever, while the Blackstone Shield could not.\u201cHopefully my luck won\u2019t be too bad,\u201d Shi Feng slightly prayed before selecting to use the Mastery Book.Following which, the System started displaying a pile of random numbers ranging from 10 to 50. As long as Shi Feng yelled \u2018Stop,\u2019 the final number to appear would be the number of Mastery Points he would obtain. It was something similar to Russian Roulette.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, many experts collected various kinds of Mastery Books to increase their Weapon Mastery. However, Mastery Books were just too rare, and even with money, one may not necessarily be able to buy it. Most players that obtained a Mastery Book would use it instead of selling it. After all, it was extremely hard to obtain a single Free Mastery Point.Shi Feng had once seen a person who was fortunate enough to obtain a Fine-Gold Mastery Book. Many players looked at that person with immense envy, and some were even willing to spend a million Credits to buy the Mastery Book from that person. However, that person refused to sell and instead, used the Mastery Book for himself. The range of Free Mastery Points provided by the Fine-Gold Mastery Book was between 30 to 200. Originally, everyone thought this fellow had very good luck. However, that person only obtained 31 Free Mastery Points, in the end, becoming a laughing stock to everyone. The points he obtained was no better than a Mysterious-Iron Mastery Book.Looking at the numbers constantly spinning, Shi Feng\u2019s heart madly thumped, not knowing what number would come out.\u201cStop!\u201d Shi Feng shouted.The wheel of numbers abruptly halted, and Shi Feng peered open his eyes and took a look.32 points.A relatively good number. Shi Feng had just effortlessly obtained 32 Free Mastery Points, which was the equivalent of the Free Mastery Points he would obtain by leveling up to Level 20.Shi Feng opened his One-handed Sword Mastery Window.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euCurrently, his One-handed Sword Mastery was still at 20 points, placing him at the level of Basic Swordsman and increasing his Base Damage by 10%.If including the 8 Free Mastery Points he obtained for leveling up to Level 5, and the 5 points he had remaining from before, he now had a total of 45 Free Mastery Points.Shi Feng immediately added 30 Mastery Points to his One-handed Sword Mastery. Instantly, his One-handed Sword Mastery rose to the level of an Intermediate Swordsman, increasing his Base Damage by 15%. As for becoming an Advanced Swordsman, he was still 50 points away from doing so.Although it was just a 5% increase in Base Damage, it should not be taken lightly. This Base Damage would be magnified many times after factoring in the bonuses from Skills. Often, the gap present between a top-tier expert and a normal expert was due to the difference in Base Damages. At this stage of the game, there might only be a fragment of experts who have reached Basic Mastery. Shi Feng had already reached Intermediate Mastery, leading them by a lot.Just as Shi Feng was about to continue advancing deeper into the Steel Fortress, the fortress\u2019 alarm rang out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 89 \u2013 Barrutia\u2019s Core Area\u201cAlert! Alert! There is an intruder in Area F! Activating self-defense system!\u201dBefore Shi Feng could celebrate his gains, a bucket of cold water dumped over his head by this loud voice. He did not think that there would be such a trap after opening the Treasure Chest.Just after arriving at the passage\u2019s exit, Shi Feng discovered that the passages leading to the other areas of the Steel Fortress were all sealed off, preventing him from entering. Meanwhile, the water level of the pool below started rising, and according to its speed, it would not be long before the passage flooded.Without hesitation, Shi Feng took out a bottle of Underwater Breathing Potion, drinking it. The potion allowed players to breathe underwater for 20 minutes. Following which, Shi Feng immediately leaped into the pool, diving towards the deepest region.After swimming down for over ten minutes, Shi Feng finally saw a dark passage. However, the water currents from there flowed rapidly, and it would not be easy for Shi Feng to approach the passage. After spending a long period, and drinking a second bottle of Underwater Breathing Potion, Shi Feng managed to crawl his way towards the passage entrance with much difficulty.Following which, he was washed away by the rapidly flowing water, his body unable to move as the current continuously pushed him along the passageway. After flowing along the water currents for several minutes, Shi Feng was thrown out of the passage and landed in another large pool.Near a wall of the large pool, some stairs spiraled upward. As long as he went up these stairs, he would arrive at the core of the fortress.Shi Feng swam towards the stairway. He then looked at the time. It was almost 8 o\u2019clock in the morning now, and since locating the Titan\u2019s Heart was not accomplishable in a short amount of time, Shi Feng immediately called out the System Interface and chose to log out.Upon waking up early in the morning, the first thing Shi Feng did was train his body. This action had long since deeply ingrained in his bones.However, he could clearly feel that his body was different from yesterday. His body no longer felt stiff, and instead, it felt extremely refreshed. The positive effects of the C-rank Nutrient Fluids he drank were evident. The fluid was slowly altering his body\u2019s condition.Strike the iron while it\u2019s hot.Shi Feng then started working out, doing sit-ups, pushups and other muscle-strengthening actions. After working out for over an hour, Shi Feng still did not feel tired. On the contrary, his body felt comfortably warm, as if there were an inexhaustible amount of energy within him.However, he did not continue training his body. Instead, he went downstairs to have a meal. Desperately working out was not necessarily a good thing. It needed to be done in moderation, as overworking his body would only yield opposite effects.After going through a night\u2019s struggle, the Gold Coins he sold and the Credits he obtained from Gentle Snow filled his current bank account with over 200,000 Credits. A night of his efforts was worth two months of salary of an executive from a big company. This was the power of God\u2019s Domain that had turned around the virtual economy. After a year, becoming rich overnight in God\u2019s Domain was not a strange affair whatsoever.Unfortunately, not many enterprises had discovered this fact yet. By the time they did discover it, they would have lagged far behind those companies that invested in God\u2019s Domain in the beginning.After eating, Shi Feng made a trip to the bank. He specifically retrieved 30,000 Credits, intending to buy the virtual reality helmets he rented. Otherwise, if he were to leave it and forget about it, he would eventually be forced out of the game. At that time, he would have to wait until the next working day before handling the necessary procedures and only after could he continue playing. Currently, the game was in a sprinting stage. If Shi Feng were to fall behind by a day, it would be extremely difficult for him to catch back up.It was also a good chance for Shi Feng to invite Blackie out for a stroll. If Blackie always hid inside his dormitory, his body was bound to have problems.There were very few people on the streets of the university early in the morning. There were only some sports societies doing their morning exercises, warming up for their work out later on. Watching these university students that radiated youth, Shi Feng felt an unreal feeling. It was as if the ten years he spent battling in God\u2019s Domain were just an illusion, an illusion that would vanish with just a touch.Walking along the roadside, Shi Feng admired the university campus as he headed towards Blackie\u2019s dormitory. He was experiencing the sceneries on the campus that he paid no attention to in his previous life.As he was about to enter into Blackie\u2019s dormitory, Shi Feng heard sounds of laughter coming from within.\u201cBlackie, weren\u2019t you extremely confident in getting into Shadow Workshop before? I\u2019ve been waiting for you for several days now, so why haven\u2019t I seen you there yet?\u201d\u201cWu Yi, haven\u2019t I already said it before? I joined another Workshop, so I didn\u2019t participate in Shadow\u2019s test.\u201d\u201cBlackie, don\u2019t try to trick me. Where in the entire Jin Hai University is there another Workshop? What is it called? How many members does it have? Who established it? Can you tell me that? If they treat players well, I might even decide to join!\u201dBeing asked in such a way, Blackie suddenly realized that Shi Feng did not actually tell him the name of their Workshop. As for the number of members\u2026 taking everything into account, there were exactly 6 people. Not to mention having a Workshop to play God\u2019s Domain, they possessed absolutely nothing right now and were even riddled with debt.\u201cBlackie, stop being obstinate. I know that you didn\u2019t pass Shadow\u2019s test. If it really is no good, then let Brother Wu plead for you. In any case, Brother Wu is currently an official member. Who knows; you might be able to become an outer member of Shadow. At the very least, you could continue playing God\u2019s Domain, and earning two thousand Credits a month should not be a problem. Don\u2019t forget, the trial period for the virtual gaming helmet is only ten days. After this period, you will not be able to continue playing the game,\u201d Blackie\u2019s fellow dorm mate sneered.\u201cIt can\u2019t be, right? What kind of Workshop can\u2019t even afford an official virtual gaming helmet? Isn\u2019t that just too pitiful?\u201d Wu Yi pretended to be shocked. He then clapped Blackie\u2019s shoulders, saying with a sigh, \u201cEven the outer members of Shadow are given an official helmet. Official members even receive an advanced helmet that\u2019s worth 20,000 Credits. Your Workshop is just ripping you off. Who started the thing? I\u2019ll demand justice for you.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you mingle with me from now on? I can guarantee that you\u2019ll obtain an official helmet. By the time I become a core member of Shadow, I guarantee that you\u2019ll be able to live in luxury. You should know that Young Master Lan has already invested five million Credits in Shadow. I heard that he has invested another two million now. If you enter Shadow, your future will be limitless.\u201d\u201cWu Yi, I\u2019ve already said it. I won\u2019t be joining. I\u2019m currently getting by very well,\u201d Blackie quickly rejected.\u201cBlackie, you should know that there aren\u2019t many such chances. Shadow Workshop is the best Workshop in Jin Hai University. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that you\u2019re already Level 5 and we\u2019re classmates, I wouldn\u2019t even be looking for you.\u201d Wu Yi patiently persuaded, \u201cYou keep saying that you\u2019ve joined some other Workshop, but you have to tell me at least the name, right? Must you keep lying to a classmate in such a way?\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t tell me that this Workshop doesn\u2019t even have a name?\u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t have a name, you must know which person established it, right? Nowadays, even nobodies dare to make Workshops, so you musn\u2019t be tricked. Shadow Workshop has an upright business sponsoring it, and there is also a contract to ensure that you won\u2019t starve to death at the very least.\u201dWu Yi was all praises about Shadow. It was as if one would become an elite in society just for entering Shadow Workshop, becoming the envy of others.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, Blackie had long since seen through Shadow. He did not have even the slightest favorable opinion towards Shadow. He only blamed himself for having a big mouth, showing off to others that he had already risen to Level 5. As a result, the information was found out by Shadow Workshop, and they had sent Wu Yi, his classmate, to recruit him.However, how could he so easily betray Shi Feng and join Shadow? He was only able to obtain all of his current achievements by relying on Shi Feng. Even if he had to suffer hardships right now, he still believed that Shi Feng would lead him towards the path of success.At this stage of the game, all the Level 5 players were experts. To Shadow Workshop, which was currently lacking experts, Blackie was an alluring beauty. So, naturally, they were itching to try and recruit him, turning him into one of the their belongings.At this moment, Shi Feng opened the door, taking a step into the room.\u201cI am the nobody that established the Workshop. I wonder what kind of opinion you have?\u201d Shi Feng looked towards the robust Wu Yi, speaking coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shi Feng wore a cheap-looking white-blue sporting wear. Although his imposing manner gave Wu Yi chills down his back, after seeing that Shi Feng was not even wearing a quantum watch on his wrist, a hint of disdain entered Wu Yi\u2019s eyes. In this day and age, even the slightly wealthier students all possessed quantum watches. Wu Yi determined that Shi Feng was not one of the wealthy children and that he was in a similar situation as Blackie.\u201cBrother Feng, why are you here?\u201d Blackie\u2019s expression was slightly panicked. He was worried Shi Feng would misunderstand and think he was trying to job-hop, \u201cBrother Feng, I really didn\u2019t seek out Shadow. I\u2019ve also rejected them, but Wu Yi won\u2019t stop annoying me about it.\u201dWhen Blackie\u2019s classmates saw him panicking and explaining, they were all puzzled at the identity of this new arrival.Blackie had already risen to Level 5 in God\u2019s Domain, so he was definitely an expert. Many Workshops would fight over for him, treating him as an important guest. Even Shadow sent someone over to recruit Blackie. If the upper-echelons of Shadow met Blackie, they might also act very cordially and treat him with respect.However, Blackie had respectfully addressed the stranger in front of them as Brother Feng, confusing them. Could the person in front of them be some famous person in their school? However, no matter how they wracked their brains, they could not think of such a person present in their university.\u201cI know,\u201d Shi Feng sent Blackie an expression that told him to be at ease. Shi Feng then looked towards the man named Wu Yi and laughingly said, \u201cI\u2019m called Shi Feng, and I am the nobody who established the Workshop you just mentioned. Didn\u2019t you wish to know the name of my Workshop?\u201d\u201cI can tell it to you. The Workshop\u2019s name is Zero Wing. It means that everything has to start out from zero and to spread your wings and soar. If you don\u2019t have any other matters, please return and tell your boss not to try poaching the members of other Workshops. He is better off taking care of his own lands, lest they fall apart without him even knowing what happened.\u201dHearing Shi Feng saying so, Wu Yu couldn\u2019t help but reveal a sneer as he laughed.\u201cAs expected, even a nobody knows how to start a Workshop. Why don\u2019t you take a look at yourself? Do you think you can start a Workshop just by announcing it?\u201d Wu Yi narrowed his eyes, mocking, \u201cDo you know how large our Shadow Workshop is? Do you know how many members our Shadow Workshop has? Do you know who is backing our Shadow Workshop? Do you know how much our Workshop has invested? Do you still think that we need to poach members from worthless Workshops like yours?\u201cJust based on the fact that you guys are still using the trial helmet to play the game shows how dirt poor you are. Did you think that, just by being full of zeal, you could establish yourselves in God\u2019s Domain and earn money? All the Workshops that have tried to establish themselves in God\u2019s Domain have at least invested several millions of Credits. Meanwhile, you have no money, no members, no facilities, and not even the most basic of assurance. So, what right do you have to compare to us, Shadow?\u201cIf you kneel down and beg me right now, I might even put in a few good words to Brother Lan. If you pay up some ten or twenty thousand Credits, you might be able to join the Workshop. How about it? Think about it; this is a rare chance for you.\u201d Wu Yi smiled savagely. He then shifted his gaze to Blackie, coldly saying, \u201cShadow is already giving you a lot of respect by sending me here to recruit you. As long as you join, you\u2019ll immediately receive the treatment of being a core member, and your monthly salary will be at least 5,000 Credits. It is hundreds of times better than staying in a Workshop that is barely surviving.\u201dWhen Blackie\u2019s several dorm mates heard of this treatment, all of them had expressions of shock on their faces. They did not think that playing God\u2019s Domain would be so rewarding. Compared to those city white-collar workers, Blackie\u2019s salary was much higher. Suddenly, the gazes they used to look at Blackie changed. They no longer looked down on him; rather, their gazes now filled with envy and admiration.They were only several months away from graduating from the university. Right now, they were still having headaches over finding jobs. Meanwhile, Blackie had someone personally coming to his door to recruit him, and the other party had even offered a minimum monthly salary of 5,000. As the saying went, \u2018comparisons are odious.\u2019If they had known about this earlier, they would have properly played games and gave God\u2019s Domain a try. They might have even become experts. They would not have had to chase after girls for their four years in universities and been looked down upon by those girls. If they managed to earn money, beauties would be lined up for their choosing.However, after listening to Wu Yi, Blackie, instead, started laughing. Wu Yi actually dared to make fun of the Workshop Shi Feng had started, calling it worthless, and even wanted to make Shi Feng kneel before him in order to join Shadow. He was retarded. The Snow Goddess is even paying attention to Brother Feng, and she even wanted to recruit Shi Feng!Who was the Snow Goddess?She was the Vice Captain of the first-rate Guild, Ouroboros. She was the publicly acknowledged Goddess of the virtual gaming world. Compared to Ouroboros, Shadow Workshop was not even worth a dime.Seeing Wu Yi\u2019s mood sour, Blackie sneered at him and said, \u201cWu Yi, even if you exaggerate it to no end, my decision will remain unchanged. Although Zero Wing Workshop has just started, I believe that our future achievements will definitely be greater than Shadow\u2019s. I advise you to leave Shadow a little earlier and join our Zero Wing Workshop. I\u2019ll ask Brother Feng for a favor. If you kneel and apologize to him, who knows, you might even be able to become a member of Zero Wing!\u201dBlackie\u2019s dorm mates were shocked upon hearing him. His declaration confused them greatly. In the end, which Workshop was truly the awesome one?Could it be that, nowadays, choosing the Workshop that couldn\u2019t even afford an official gaming helmet was the right choice?\u201cYou\u2026 You are simply unreasonable!\u201d Wu Yi was almost speechless with anger. Blackie actually used his own words to make fun of him. If it weren\u2019t for Brother Zhang instructing him that he definitely must invite Blackie, he would have long since left. It was against his expectations that Blackie would have a brain defect, throwing away a good future and insisting on mingling in a gutter-like place. \u201cBlackie, I am only reminding you because I value talent. Our Shadow is currently trying to annex the 45th ranked Workshop in Jin Hai City, Hungry Wolves Workshop. When Shadow succeeds in doing so, we will rank at the top of all of Jin Hai City. If you were to miss this chance now, there would be no more chances for you in the future.\u201dWu Yi shot a glance at Shi Feng, coldly saying, \u201cMeanwhile, your Workshop can\u2019t even afford the official gaming helmet. How do you plan to play God\u2019s Domain in the future? It would be better if you joined Shadow. A great future is awaiting you here.\u201dFaced with such a brazen way of poaching people, even if Shi Feng\u2019s temper were much cooler, he would still get slightly angry.Since they were fated to battle each other, then battle it was!\u201cWho said that our Workshop couldn\u2019t afford the official gaming helmet?\u201d Shi Feng took out the 20,000 Credits from his pocket, casually throwing it on the table, saying, \u201cI previously decided that starting a Workshop would be too sudden, and I was never able to decide which type of official gaming helmet I would buy. So, I was only using the trial helmet as a temporary replacement. However, today, I\u2019m here to give Blackie the money to buy an advanced gaming helmet.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBut really, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to criticize Shadow, but aren\u2019t you guys being too cheap in poaching for people? The salary I\u2019m giving Blackie is 20,000 Credits minimum. Your Shadow is so rich, and has invested so much, yet, the salary you\u2019re offering is only a minimum of 5,000 Credits?\u201dWhen Blackie saw the shining-white Credits on the table, he turned to look at Shi Feng astonished eyes. Nobody was more knowledgeable of Shi Feng\u2019s financial condition than he was, so how was he able to suddenly throw down 20,000 Credits? Could it be that\u2026 Shi Feng robbed a bank?The others in the dormitory swallowed their saliva when they saw the Credits scattered across the table.Usually, Blackie remained hidden and did not seem like anything special. They did not think that his monthly salary would be 20,000 Credits. It was no wonder why he refused to join Shadow Workshop. After all, Shadow was only offering him 5,000 Credits, four times less than his current earnings. Even an idiot would know which side to choose.What was even more unthinkable was that Shi Feng, who was wearing a suit of cheaply-looking sportswear, was actually a Brother Tycoon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 91 \u2013 Going Through Thick and Thin TogetherLooking at the Credits on the table, Wu Yi\u2019s complexion alternated between green and red. His face was gloomy to the degree of being able to squeeze water out.How was this possible?!Ignoring the credibility of the monthly salary of 20,000 Credits, just being able to toss down 20,000 Credits casually was not normal.Wu Yi had seen many wealthy tycoons before, and his eyesight had never failed him before. The clothing that Shi Feng was currently wearing was not even worth 300 Credits, so how could Shi Feng possibly have that much money? Moreover, when he took it out, it was just so simple. He even casually threw it onto the table. This series of actions were not habits of an average person, and they were impossible fake. Only those tycoons that paid no heed to Credits would carry the action out in such a relaxed and comfortable manner.What Wu Yi did not know was that Shi Feng was once the Guild Leader of Shadow. Throwing money away like dirt was just a small matter to him. He even spent tens of millions of Credits to poach a few Master-level Lifestyle players. During those times, he had thrown stack after stack of Credits onto the table, causing those Lifestyle players to worship him immediately.Throwing out just 20,000 Credits was not even a warm-up for him.\u201cHumph! Just this amount of money is nothing. As long as you have the strength to join the upper-echelons of Shadow, a monthly salary of 50,000 to 60,000 Credits is just a small matter. Moreover, we have the support of Young Master Lan, so our funds are extremely abundant. Furthermore, the celebrities of our school have also joined Shadow. The 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 9th ranked students in the university\u2019s most recent fighting competition have all joined Shadow. These people are the true experts, and they could easily rise to fame in God\u2019s Domain. Meanwhile, what kind of true experts does your Workshop have?\u201d Wu Yi pretended to be calm as he coldly snorted. However, he still could not help himself to steal a glance at the 20,000 Credits thrown on the table.The basic wage for an official member of Shadow was just 3,000 to 5,000 Credits. Although it was slightly better than the salary of many university fresh graduates, there was still a limit. Such an amount was not enough for one to act carelessly.\u201cWu Yi, we will deal with the matters of Zero Wing by ourselves. It is still not up to you to comment on our problems. If your boss wishes to annex our Workshop, first offer up a monthly salary of 100,000 or above, let me be Shadow\u2019s Vice Leader, and Brother Feng the Guild Leader. Otherwise, please return.\u201d Blackie was extremely irritated after hearing Wu Yi speak. He abruptly stood up and pointed towards the dormitory\u2019s entrance as he looked at Wu Yi with a disdainful smile. Blackie\u2019s performance was extremely arrogant and incomparably rampant. He held no regard for Shadow at all.Was it amazing to have many members? Did being an expert in a fighting competition mean they could play well in God\u2019s Domain? If one had the ability, then they could hitch up a relationship with those first-rate Guilds. See if they pay any attention!\u201cBlackie, you better not regret this in the future. Shadow is fated to become a giant in Jin Hai City. When that time comes, don\u2019t even think about joining Shadow,\u201d Wu Yi left after speaking. He was determined to tell Brother Zhang and Young Master Lan about everything that had happened here, letting them take care of the ignorant Shi Feng and Blackie.\u201cThanks for your worries, but I never eat the medicine of regret when I do something. Although Shadow is amazing, unfortunately, it isn\u2019t enough to enter my eyes.\u201d Blackie loudly declared, and almost everyone in the entire building could hear him speak.Blackie\u2019s dorm mates were all stunned. When did Blackie become so awesome? He actually dared to let out such bombastic words, publicly rejecting the invitation of Shadow Workshop that\u2019s famous throughout the whole university. How many people dreamed of the job he rejected?After Wu Yi left, Blackie instantly lost his previous heroism. His bum immediately landed in a chair, his heart silently lamenting that it was all over. Because of his momentary rampant emotions, he became hot-headed and made enemies out of Shadow. Wasn\u2019t this just making trouble for Zero Wing?On the other hand, Shi Feng was extremely touched. As expected, Blackie was still the same in both his previous and current lives. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, Blackie had immediately resigned from his position without hesitation and followed Shi Feng. Now, this was a true brother. In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, the countless people around him could only share the gains but not the pains. Shi Feng also knew what Blackie was currently worried about, so he clapped his hands and said in agreement, \u201cWell said! In the struggles of the virtual gaming world, winning or losing can be changed in the blink of an eye. There are no such things as eternal winners. As long as we work hard enough, sooner or later, we will definitely surpass Shadow.\u201dAs long as Zero Wing Workshop developed, they were bound to come into conflict with Shadow. If Shadow wished to spare no expense to deal with them, then they could just use Shadow\u2019s reputation to spread Zero Wing\u2019s fame throughout the university campus. That way, Shi Feng would not have to waste efforts to publicize his Guild.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll go out and take a walk and buy an advanced helmet on the way. Always staying in your dormitory won\u2019t be good for your body.\u201d Shi Feng left the room, letting Blackie tidy himself up. Blackie was constantly holed up in his dorm room these days. He was even playing God\u2019s Domain during the daytime, not doing any other activities. Although it wouldn\u2019t be a problem in the short-term, after awhile, the damage to his body would become very significant.\u201cBrother Feng, wait for a moment. I\u2019ll come immediately.\u201dBlackie immediately collected all the Credits on the table, then tidied himself before leaving the dormitory with Shi Feng. Only his dumbfounded dorm mates remained in the room. They all looked at each other, their faces revealing bitter smiles. Normally, they had, many times, made fun of Blackie. Never would they have thought that Blackie was hiding his true appearance. He even managed to gain the favor of a tycoon.\u201cThis won\u2019t do. I will also apply for a trial gaming helmet.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve decided. I\u2019ll become a professional gamer in God\u2019s Domain.\u201dWhen Shi Feng had walked out of the dormitory, Blackie quietly stuffed the 20,000 Credits into Shi Feng\u2019s pocket.\u201cBrother Feng, you really gave me a shock today. However, the way you threw out the money was just too cool! I felt awesome just seeing Wu Yi\u2019s expression. But, you better keep this money properly. Don\u2019t simply throw it around next time,\u201d Blackie said excitedly.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d Shi Feng slightly wrinkled his brows. He then gave the money back to Blackie. He had never been putting up an act; from the beginning, he intended to give Blackie the money. He knew that Blackie\u2019s family situation was not that good either. With this money, he would be able to alleviate a lot of his family\u2019s burden. \u201cI\u2019ve already said that your basic salary every month would be 20,000 Credits. Did you think I was just joking with Wu Yi? Just take this money as your salary in advance.\u201dLooking at the 20,000 Credits in his hands, Blackie\u2019s mouth widened, staring blankly at the money.Originally, even if Shi Feng\u2019s previous words were but a joke, they were enough to make him feel happy. However, looking at Shi Feng\u2019s expression, he knew that Shi Feng was not joking. Shi Feng had truly intended to give him a monthly salary of 20,000 Credits. Moreover, Shi Feng intended to give him the money that he was currently holding.However, where did all this money come from?Blackie was extremely clear about Shi Feng\u2019s condition. Being able to borrow 20,000 Credits was already a difficult feat. Now, Shi Feng was even giving all of it to him. This was just insane.\u201cBrother Feng, if you give away this money, what will you do about the Workshop? Moreover, the deadline for the trial gaming helmets is almost up. You are bound to have to buy the official gaming helmet, right? Won\u2019t this money be just the right amount to buy it? In any case, I\u2019m currently not in need of money.\u201d Blackie pushed the Credits back to Shi Feng again. It would be a lie if he were to say that the 20,000 Credits didn\u2019t attract him. However, he couldn\u2019t just ignore his brother\u2019s situation just because of some money.Shi Feng could naturally discern Blackie\u2019s worries. He clapped Blackie\u2019s shoulders and couldn\u2019t help but reveal a smile. His bank account currently held over 100,000 Credits, and most likely, during this period, it had risen to over 200,000 Credits. In another ten days or so, he would earn even more money. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. You also don\u2019t have to worry about the matter of the gaming helmets. Haven\u2019t I said it already? Leave the matters regarding money to me.\u201dShi Feng possessed the memories of his previous life. He was also the Guild Leader of Shadow. All beginnings had with hardships. Although earning the initial fundings was extremely difficult, as long as he obtained them, the following matters would become much easier to deal with. If he did not even possess the method of making money with money, then how would he have been able to turn Shadow into a second-rate Guild?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBrother Feng, you couldn\u2019t have possibly\u2026\u201d Seeing that Shi Feng was so confident, Blackie\u2019s first feelings were not excitement or happiness. Instead, he was trembling. He worried that Shi Feng might have done something bad, such as being ** by a rich woman to obtain this money. Compared to borrowing the money, this was a much more horrifying scenario.\u201cWhat are you blindly thinking about? Don\u2019t forget about the matter of cooperation we have with Gentle Snow. This is just the compensation she has given. Now, we no longer have to stay poor and blank. We already have some funds, so relax.\u201d Shi Feng rolled his eyes at Blackie. This fellow\u2019s thinking was just too slanted.Shi Feng did not reveal the real truth. Otherwise, it would be extremely hard for him to explain. So, he simply pushed everything onto Gentle Snow. In any case, Gentle Snow was the Great Goddess that everybody knew.When Blackie heard Shi Feng, sudden realization struck him. He sent Shi Feng a gaze filled with worship. Being able to gain the favor of the Snow Goddess was the dream of every man!It was as expected of Brother Feng! His methods were just too awesome!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In his other hand, he was flipping through a thick stack of resumes.Dang! Dang! Dang!\u201cEnter,\u201d the man with the thick eyebrows said in a deep tone.\u201cBrother Zhang, I\u2019ve done the thing that you asked of me.\u201d Wu Yi gently opened the door and carefully entered. He then stood, panicked, in front of the desk.Although it was not his first time meeting Shadow\u2019s person-in-power, Zhang Luowei, he still felt an intense pressure every time they met. He was always scared and on edge whenever he spoke with this person.In Shadow Workshop, aside from Lan Hailong, Zhang Luowei\u2019s authority was the highest. Moreover, Zhang Luowei was the champion of Jin Hai University\u2019s fighting competition. He was also one of the hot contenders for becoming the champion of Jin Hai City\u2019s fighting competition. Even Lan Hailong was respectful before this person, as one of the main reasons why Shadow became so popular within the university was due to Zhang Luowei\u2019s personal fame.\u201cSit. Tell me about it.\u201d Zhang Luowei placed the resumes to a side, his finger pointing towards the leathered sofa in front of his desk.Although Zhang Luowei looked like an amiable person, Wu Yi knew that, below that appearance, there was an abyss-like horror. Zhang Luowei\u2019s personality was both vicious and merciless. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to suppress fighting experts like Zhou Yuhu and others.After some thought, Wu Yi slightly organized his words before saying, \u201cBrother Zhang, the others have already agreed. It is only that Blackie that is a stone inside a latrine pit, both smelly and hard. He wouldn\u2019t agree, no matter what, and he had joined a newly established Workshop called Zero Wing. He even said that it was beneath him to join a trash Workshop like Shadow.\u201d\u201cNot willing to join, is it? He\u2019s even joined Zero Wing Workshop?\u201d Zhang Luowei displayed contemplation as he smiled. However, inside his eyes, a cold glint flashed, \u201cWhat is the origin of this Zero Wing Workshop? Why haven\u2019t I heard of it before?\u201d\u201cBrother Zhang, Zero Wing Workshop was established by a Year Four student named Shi Feng. I heard that this Workshop has nothing at all. They are also buying their gaming facilities only today. However, that person is quite rich. He offered Blackie a basic monthly salary of 20,000 Credits. He even wanted me to bring back word to Brother Zhang, telling you to stop trying to poach members of other Workshops and take care of your own land.\u201d Wu Yi was very angry while he spoke, \u201cWhen I heard this, even I couldn\u2019t bear to stomach it. They are just a greenhorn Workshop, yet they dare to challenge Shadow. Brother Zhang, how about I take some men to extinguish their overwhelming attitude?\u201d\u201cShi Feng, is it? I seem to have heard this name before.\u201d Zhang Luowei wrinkled his brows slightly, trying to figure out where he heard this name. However, after thinking for some time, he still could not recall. He shook his head, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t bother with them. In a few days, the school will be holding the annual Fellowship Party. This is a great chance for Shadow to have a meteoric rise, so we don\u2019t have the time to waste on these little Workshops.\u201d\u201cRight, you organize the newly recruited members and have them quickly level up. The Guilds in White River City will be starting the competition over the honor of getting the First Clear for the twenty-man Dungeon very soon. We also have to fight for the fame obtaining the First Clear of a Level 5 Dungeon.\u201d\u201cYes! You can rest assured, Brother Zhang. I will help them quickly rise to Level 5,\u201d Wu Yi clapped his chest, assuring.Elsewhere, Shi Feng brought Blackie along to purchase two advanced virtual gaming helmets.Although the current virtual reality technology was very advanced, the basic helmet was a cheaply made in consideration of the general masses. Its degree of synchronization was just 80%. However, the advanced version of the helmet could reach up to 90% synchronization, and the user\u2019s five senses would become much more sensitive. Although the difference did not seem too great, during a battle between equal strengths, this small difference would be the determining factor of victory or defeat.The battles in God\u2019s Domain were always life or death battles. Moreover, the penalty of a single death was a great amount of EXP and Skill Proficiency. Hence, most large-scale Workshops would allocate an advanced virtual gaming helmet to all their official members .Previously, Shi Feng did not have the money to purchase even a basic gaming helmet. Now that he had the money, however, he naturally would not fall behind in this aspect.After purchasing the advanced gaming helmets, Shi Feng found a good restaurant and ordered some high-class nutrition meals. He ate with Blackie as they talked about the future development of their Workshop.Such a situation made Blackie feel like he was in a dream.God\u2019s Domain had only been running for slightly more than three days. Not only had Shi Feng solved the problem of the gaming helmets, but Shi Feng also brought him to a high-class restaurant for a meal and discussion of the matters of developing their Workshop.The more unbelievable thing was that Shi Feng unhesitatingly gave him a salary of 20,000 Credits. Just how many university students\u2019 dream was it to have a monthly salary of 20,000 Credits? On the other hand, he hadn\u2019t even helped Shi Feng out much, yet, he was able to obtain such a salary. Although Blackie did not voice it, inwardly, he was extremely moved. He felt extremely apologetic to Shi Feng, so he silently swore that he would work hard to be of help to Shi Feng.Shi Feng and Blackie conversed for a long time. They properly discussed the matters regarding the future development of their Workshop. They also prepared to officially recruit Lonely Snow and the others, establishing a real Workshop. The remaining matters were to find a location to set up their Workshop, purchasing facilities for the Workshop, and the Workshop\u2019s administration.\u201cBrother Feng, leave these to me since I\u2019m usually doing nothing during the day. It is already hard on you just to level up and earn money. Anyway, I am an Economy and Management major, so it is a great chance for me to display my specialty. I guarantee that you will be satisfied,\u201d Blackie assured. He couldn\u2019t help but want to start his work immediately.\u201cGood, then I\u2019ll leave it to you,\u201d Shi Feng smiled. He felt extremely relieved with Blackie managing things.After the two parted, Shi Feng sent a message to his parents. He then sent them 3,000 Credits, telling them not to send him living expenses any longer. He told them that he had already found a good job, and that he was able to support himself financially.Shi Feng was still not ready to tell his parents about everything. If he were to tell them that he had earned over 200,000 Credits in just a few days, they would most likely not accept it. So, he might as well take it slow, gradually increasing the money he sent them. That way, his old folks would be able to gradually accept it, thinking it reasonable and fair.At 7 o\u2019clock in the evening, after having his meal, Shi Feng drank a bottle of C-rank Nutrient Fluid. He put on the newly-bought advanced virtual gaming helmet, starting his conquest in God\u2019s Domain.Upon entering God\u2019s Domain this time, the sensation Shi Feng felt when he stood beside the large pool was completely different.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe cool breeze blowing\u2026 The sounds water flowing into the pool\u2026 The scratches and rust that were clearly visible on the steel walls\u2026 The faint smell of machine oil\u2026 Even the feeling of manipulating his own body had become much more relaxed.Shi Feng flexed his body on the stairway. He then pulled out his swords, slashing out streak after streak of beautiful sword images. The sword images kept flickering in and out of existence, giving an unpredictable feeling.\u201cEh. The feeling I had while playing God\u2019s Domain in the previous life is finally back,\u201d Shi Feng stopped waving his swords, extremely pleased with his current condition.In his previous life, Shi Feng was used to using the virtual reality cabin. The virtual reality cabin\u2019s synchronizing rate could reach up to 97%. In God\u2019s Domain, if the System Interface, Status indicators and other such things weren\u2019t present, players would be practically unable to differentiate between the real world and the virtual world.After getting used to his body, Shi Feng felt that he should start searching for the Titan\u2019s Heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93 \u2013 Dark ClownThe spiral staircase led directly to the core control area on the highest floor.After climbing an unknown number of steps, Shi Feng arrived at a winding corridor that led towards the core area. Ancient magical runes were carved into the walls on both sides of the corridor, and even though almost a millennium had passed, this corridor was still gleaming with light. Only some parts of the corridor had decayed, damaging the magical circuits etched in it and plunging those particular areas into darkness. Fortunately, not many parts of the corridor were badly decayed, so Shi Feng was still able to clearly see the entirety of the long, narrow, and maze-like corridor.Just after Shi Feng set foot into the corridor, the alarm once again rang out.\u201cAlert! Alert! The intruder has already invaded Area A of the fortress, the Magic Corridor. Activating Guardian Statues on duty!\u201dShi Feng then heard loud booming noises coming from the corridor, as if some gigantic machine had started moving.Shi Feng no longer dared advance slowly. He immediately used a Speed Scroll, dashing through the Magic Corridor at flying speed.After taking several turns in the Magic Corridor, Shi Feng discovered a machine that had a flashing red light. Although this machine was just the size of a football, it was constantly producing alarms, as if it were a tool meant for guiding the Guardian Statues.[Sentinel Guard] (Common Monster)Level 10HP 200/200Shi Feng immediately understood how he was so easily discovered. This Sentinel Guard was just like a radar. It could detect enemies within a range of 500 yards, and after discovering them, it would set off an alarm. The distance between the entrance of the corridor and this location was roughly around 500 yards, so the Sentinel Guard was able to immediately discover Shi Feng. As long as Shi Feng could get rid of it, then he would be able to rid himself of the alarms of this area.However, this thing had very sensitive reactions. It would not let any enemies get within 30 yards. Also, if it were attacked even once, it would try to retreat with all its might. Simultaneously, it would increase its speed of calling for its allies, and it would absolutely not give the enemy a second chance to attack. It was extremely hard to deal with.\u201cI guess I\u2019ve no choice left. I can only give it a try.\u201d Shi Feng unsheathed both of his swords. He could already hear the angry roars of the Guardian Statues coming from behind him. Based on his strength, fighting in this narrow area would only lead to his own death. His only chance of throwing off those Guardian Statues was to get rid of this Sentinel Guard.When Shi Feng was nearing the 30-yard range, just as the Sentinel Guard was about to break into a run\u2026Shi Feng\u2019s eyes locked onto the Sentinel Guard, the muscles in both of his arms bulged, and with the strength of his entire body, he cast out both swords.Xiu! Both swords flew towards the Sentinel Guard.Precision Throw!The throwing distance of the skill was just at 30 yards, and it caused 150% of his weapon\u2019s damage.The Sentinel Guard was extremely vigilant. It rapidly moved its body, immediately dodging the Crimson Blade that flew at it. However, the Sentinel Guard\u2019s dodge had, in turn, placed it in the flight path of Shi Feng\u2019s second sword, the Abyssal Blade.Peng!The Abyssal Blade pierced through the Sentinel Guard, causing -211 damage and instantly killing it.System: Level 10 Sentinel Guard killed. Level difference of 4. EXP obtained increased by 400%. Obtained 800 EXP.Shi Feng activated Windwalk, his speed once again increasing by a notch as he rushed to pull out his swords that pierced into the ground. He then rushed towards the Magic Corridor\u2019s exit. Without the guidance of the Sentinel Guard, the Guardian Statues were like flies that lost their eyes. They ran around all over the place, completely unable to find Shi Feng.More than a dozen minutes later, after getting rid of another three Sentinel Guards, Shi Feng finally escaped the Magic Corridor, arriving at the control room.There was a barrier in the central region of the control room. A dark grey colored sphere of iron was placed inside the barrier. This sphere of iron was the heart of the Steel Fortress, and it was the fortress\u2019 source of energy. It was the Titan\u2019s Heart.\u201cI never thought that, after so many years have passed, there would still be somebody who would come to this place.\u201dBefore Shi Feng could examine the entire control room in detail, he heard a deep sneer coming from the entrance of the barrier. This sound was bone-chilling, and no human was capable of producing such a sound. Only a puppet or a corpse would be capable of sounding so emotionless.\u201cWelcome to my Steel Fortress Barrutia! In order to celebrate your arrival, I\u2019ve decided to use your fiery flesh and blood to feed my baby! Come out, Hellhound!\u201dShi Feng could faintly see the outline of a humanoid lifeform inside the barrier. However, the figure seemed to be currently absorbing the energy of the Titan\u2019s Heart, so it did not have surplus powers to deal with Shi Feng, sending out its pet in its stead.\u201cAo! Ao! Ao!\u201d A large black dog, its entire body covered in flames, rushed out from the barrier.[Hellhound] (Elite-rank)Level 15HP 6,000/6,000\u201cCrap, did I come at a bad time?\u201d Shi Feng\u2019s brows slightly wrinkled as he observed the Hellhound. According to the information in his previous life, there were definitely no lifeforms or monsters in this place. The person that did the Quest was able to safely take the Titan\u2019s Heart away. So, why was it that, when it was his turn to do the Quest, a mysterious character appeared here, trying to steal the Titan\u2019s Heart\u2019s energy.However, Shi Feng also thought of another possibility.This mysterious character stole all the energy of the Titan\u2019s Heart first. Meanwhile, the player who came here had merely taken away the Titan\u2019s Heart that was empty of any energy. On the other hand, Shi Feng had coincidentally run into this energy thief. However, unfortunately for Shi Feng, he wasn\u2019t even capable of defeating the pet of this mysterious character, not to mention the person, itself.\u201cSince you want to battle, then come!\u201d Shi Feng pulled out his swords, his attention affixed on the slowly approaching Hellhound.As the Hellhound\u2019s distance from him continuously shortened, Shi Feng could feel his surroundings become exceptionally hot, causing his mouth to feel parched. Shi Feng thought of taking out a Cold Beverage to enjoy, but he currently couldn\u2019t carelessly move about. He would immediately reveal a weak point as soon as he moved. As a Level 15 Elite monster, the Hellhound\u2019s intelligence was already extremely high. It was the reason why it leisurely walked towards Shi Feng.That was because the Hellhound knew the best time for it to launch an attack. As long as Shi Feng revealed a gap, it would immediately bite at him with all its might, not letting go of Shi Feng until he was completely dead.In the confrontation between the two, after all was said and done, the Hellhound was still the more powerful. So, naturally, it would not simply wait. Its legs immediately pushed against the ground, leaping high into the air and transforming into a ball of fire. It then opened its flaming maw.Shi Feng rolled to a side, dodging the Hellhound\u2019s pouncing attack.However, immediately after the Hellhound landed, its flaming claws slashed horizontally.Shi Feng had long since prepared for this, so he used both of his swords to Parry.Peng! Although Shi Feng did not receive any damage, his entire body was thrown.The Hellhound immediately opened its large mouth, spewing scorching-hot flames. The flames wrapped around Shi Feng completely, preventing him from escaping.Shi Feng clenched his teeth. He used Phantom Kill, and at the moment of imminent peril, he swapped positions with his doppelganger in mid-air.Shi Feng\u2019s doppelganger was immediately swallowed by the flames, instantly turning into a pile of ash. Meanwhile, the System Notification showed a damage of up to -3,000. Even if Shi Feng were to take the hit with his HP full and all of his Life Shield[1] activated, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to shoulder this attack.Shi Feng clearly felt how powerful the Hellhound was. Such damage was definitely not something a Level 15 Elite monster could dish out. Its strength was greatly increased because of the Quest\u2019s Story Line. According to his experience, Shi Feng estimated the Hellhound\u2019s actual level to be over Level 30, and it should be a Lord-rank Boss.If the pet were already this powerful, then what about its owner?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing that the Hellhound\u2019s flaming claws were about to slap down at him, Shi Feng used Abyssal Bind. Even if the Hellhound were any stronger, it would still be restricted for 3 seconds. Following which, Shi Feng rushed into the barrier at the center of the room. Currently, the best option Shi Feng possessed was to snatch the Titan\u2019s Heart and swiftly depart.However, just after entering the barrier, Shi Feng immediately became shocked upon seeing this mysterious person\u2019s true identity.\u201cDark Clown!\u201d Shi Feng immediately recognized the identity of this mysterious character. His heart could not help but be surprised, \u201cWhy is such a bastard here?\u201dTL Notes:[1]Life Shield: Effect 2 of the Silvermoon Set Equipment (mentioned in Chapter 81)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94 \u2013 Titan\u2019s HeartAlthough Shi Feng was shocked, his feet never stopped moving. His figure turned into an after image as he rushed towards the Titan\u2019s Heart, located at the center of the barrier. He then used Observing Eyes on the Dark Clown.\u201cUnknown?\u201d Shi Feng was shocked.Aside from the information showing that the figure was indeed a Dark Clown, there was nothing else displayed. All of it was just question marks.There were only two possibilities for such a situation to occur. The first was that the Dark Clown was equipping an advanced camouflage item. The other was that its strength was simply too overwhelming, preventing the basic Observing Eyes from identifying it.It was very clearly the latter situation taking place in this case.According to Shi Feng\u2019s memories, Dark Clowns were a group of mysterious lifeforms. They always wore clown clothing with many bells as decorations. They looked human, but were not human. However, neither were they living spirits. Each one of them was extremely powerful. They could simply appear at any location, and they could come and go without leaving behind a single trace. Even if it was the Palace of Star-Moon Kingdom, they could still easily enter it.However, this was but a small matter. Shi Feng had previously seen a Tier 3 Great Druid NPC die at the hands of the Dark Clowns. Their methods of attacking were simply unforgettable. The attacks were impossible to avoid.\u201cDespicable human, you actually dare barge into this place?!\u201d The Dark Clown had its face wrapped in a black cloth, revealing only its two glowing red eyes. Although its enraged expression could not be seen, its tone was extremely agitated.Streak after streak of green colored energy was currently being absorbed by the Dark Clown. Clearly it was a crucial moment, so it was unable to take action against Shi Feng.This situation gave Shi Feng a chance to prevent this assimilation ceremony, and deal heavy damage to the Dark Clown. Otherwise, when this critical period passed, the Dark Clown, which was capable of killing even a Tier 3 Great Druid, would instantly kill Shi Feng with just a wave of its hand.\u201cCyber, get rid of him for me!\u201d the Dark Clown urged.Shi Feng revealed a faint smile. Seeing the Dark Clown\u2019s anxious appearance, Shi Feng tried even harder to deal some damage against it. As for the Hellhound behind him, it was still restricted by chains. It was too late, even if it tried to rush over to Shi Feng.Chop!Shi Feng used all of his strength. With the flick of his wrist, a large explosion sounded out. The Abyssal Blade turned into a streak of black light, piercing directly towards the Magic Circle that was absorbing energy from the Titan\u2019s Heart.\u94db\uff01Dang!The Magic Weapon Abyssal Blade, which had been successful in every previous endeavor, was blocked outside of the Magic Array. It created brilliant white sparks as it collided with the Magic Array, dealing no damage at all to the Absorption Magic Array.\u201cPitiful human. Did you think a weak little Swordsman like you could destroy my Magic Array? Just give up and become Cyber\u2019s food! Who knows, I might even let your soul go. Otherwise, prepare for endless pain after you die!\u201d the Dark Clown threatened.At this moment, the Hellhound rushed over.\u201cYou\u2019re just a clown, yet you dare spout nonsense! Did you think I have no ways to deal with you?\u201d Shi Feng sneered. He took out a dark, gray-colored Magic Scroll from his bag.\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re literally insane! Do you know what you are trying to do!?\u201dThe Dark Clown abruptly yelled out in shock after seeing this piece of dark, gray-colored Magic Scroll.\u201cIt seems you know your stuff. At worst, we\u2019ll both die together.\u201d Shi Feng did not wish to use this item either, however, he was going to die anyway, so why should he still care? He then unfolded the Magic Scroll, and his mouth started chanting the activation incantation.This was one of the only three Tier 2 Magic Scrolls that Shi Feng possessed: Obliterating Torrent. It possessed the ability to devour all magic elements, turning them into nothingness. This Magic Scroll belonged to the peak of Tier 2 Magic Scrolls.Suddenly, the magic elements in the center of the barrier surged, becoming incomparably violent, following which, it started collapsing without any signs of stopping.The Absorption Magic Array was made up of magic elements, so, naturally, it could not escape its fate as it collapsed and exploded.The entire Magic Array was similar to frying beans, producing crackling sounds. The Magic Array loudly exploded, dispersing streak after streak of dazzling shockwaves.Shi Feng immediately activated Defensive Blade, becoming immune to the damage of six ranged attacks. He then rushed towards the Titan\u2019s Heart.However, it was not easy to collect the Titan\u2019s Heart. Shi Feng either had to deplete all the energy the Titan\u2019s Heart possessed, or he would need to have the key to remove the barrier. Fortunately, Shi Feng had the key. In the midst of the explosions, Shi Feng unlocked the barrier protecting the Titan\u2019s Heart, then stored it in his bag.The shockwaves created by the Obliterating Torrent sent the Hellhound flying away, violently slamming it into a wall. The wall then split apart like a spiderweb. Following which, the Hellhound heavily landed on the ground, and didn\u2019t stand back up.However, the shockwaves of the explosion did no harm to the Dark Clown, as if they had just passed through its body. The Dark Clown\u2019s body seemed as though it did not exist in this plane of existence. However, the backlash from the magic ceremony failing had caused great damage to it. The Dark Clown silently glared at Shi Feng, faintly having the intention to take action.\u201cHumph! Come if you have the ability!\u201d Shi Feng smiled in disdain as he took out another deep-blue colored Tier 2 Magic Scroll.Shi Feng had already obtained the Titan\u2019s Heart. Even if he died, a Quest Item could not be dropped. The Dark Clown was already extremely weakened as well, and at most, it would only be slightly stronger than him. Shi Feng still had two pieces of Tier 2 Magic Scrolls. At worst, he would perish together with the Dark Clown.He could still revive after dying, but if the Dark Clown died, then it would truly be dead.Let\u2019s see who\u2019s afraid of who!\u201cDespicable human, I\u2019ll let you off this time! We will meet again sooner or later. It will be your death when that time comes!\u201d The Dark Clown gave up the notion of getting rid of Shi Feng after seeing the Magic Scroll. It only left behind a ruthless remark as it disappeared from the control room, together with the Hellhound.Shi Feng silently waited for a moment. After confirming no movements from his surroundings, he let loose a breath of relief. However, he did not store away the Tier 2 Magic Scroll.He truly did not wish to use the Tier 2 Magic Scroll and perish together with the Dark Clown. However, based on the Dark Clown\u2019s intelligence, it too would make the right choice.Shi Feng had already obtained the Titan\u2019s Heart. He took out a Return Scroll and started chanting.Thirty seconds later Shi Feng turned into a white glow, disappearing from the control room as well.After Shi Feng disappeared, the Dark Clown appeared once more. The red glow let out from its eyes became even more brilliant now. It clearly did not expect Shi Feng to be so cautious. From beginning to end, Shi Feng had never put away the Tier 2 Magic Scroll. Otherwise, it would have had a chance to kill Shi Feng.\u201cWretched human! The method I\u2019ve spent more than ten years researching to absorb the energy from the Titan\u2019s Heart\u2026! When I recover, I will definitely make you wish for death!\u201d the Dark Clown bellowed. It abruptly waved its hand, and tens of flying blades destroyed the pedestal, which lost the protection of the barrier.On the other side, Shi Feng had already returned to Red Leaf Town.Currently, the amount of players in Red Leaf Town grew even greater. The streets were filled with players selling Level 0 to Level 2 Common Equipment and basic skill books.Shi Feng took a look at his bag. It had been some time since Gold Coins stopped entering his account. He thus decided to go sell some items before going to hand in his Quest.The previous Forging Designs were already sold out. Shi Feng took out another twenty pieces of Glimmer Chestplate Forging Designs and placed them at the Auction House to be sold in batches.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt this time, a communication request came from Gentle Snow.\u201cThree hours from now, meet up in front of Dark Moon Graveyard\u2019s entrance. Get your team prepared for it and bring the necessary potions. Our Ouroboros must definitely snatch the First Clear of this Dungeon this time, so we\u2019ll be looking forward to your performance,\u201d Gentle Snow\u2019s tone was very indifferent, as if she was giving out a command. It was completely different from their meeting just now.\u201cWill do. I\u2019ll definitely arrive three hours from now.\u201d However, Shi Feng did not particularly mind it, as that was the Snow Goddess\u2019s regular attitude. He estimated the time, thinking that he should be able to make it.Neither of them traded unnecessary words, immediately disconnecting the call.After that, Shi Feng purchased Card Sets and Hard Stones at the Auction House. He also bought some materials required to make Bronze Equipment and Mysterious-Iron Equipment. After storing the materials inside the bank, Shi Feng went on to buy some Magic Scrolls and necessary potions. He then ran towards the White Sand Ruins to turn in his Quest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What level are you guys at right now?\u201d Shi Feng asked.\u201cLeveling up in this hidden area is just too awesome! There is still no one coming over here to steal monsters, and everyone is at Level 5 right now. Moreover, we obtained a lot of Wolf Meat and Wolf Skin, and our bags have long since been filled to the brim. Right now, we\u2019re preparing to return to town and clear out our bags a bit,\u201d Blackie excitedly said. In this short period of time, they had obtained four pieces of Level 5 Bronze Equipment from grinding on Forest Wolf Dens. Amongst them, there was a Level 5 Bronze Staff that allowed Blackie\u2019s damage to increase by a lot.\u201cFull already? You guys sure are efficient.\u201d Shi Feng was slightly shocked. A stack of Wolf Meat had 100 pieces in it. Previously, Blackie and the others had purchased plenty of Big Bags. Shi Feng never thought that they would be filled so quickly. How many Wolf Meat was this? If all of them were to be given to Violet Cloud to be made into advanced cookings, then it would become a huge profit.\u201cThat\u2019s right, you guys pass all of your Wolf Meat to a female Cleric called Violet Cloud. Just give out my name when you meet her. Afterward, you guys rest up a little and buy some HP and MP recovery potions, then wait for me at the Trade Area.\u201d\u201cBrother Feng, are we going to go Dungeon-diving with the Snow Goddess?\u201d Blackie excitedly asked, after recalling some things.\u201cEn, so properly rest up. You\u2019ll have to tense up your nerves after entering the Dungeon.\u201d Shi Feng nodded his head, disconnecting the call.On the other hand, Blackie had nearly jumped up in excitement. Originally, he had thought Shi Feng would not be bringing them along to the Dungeon. After all, their techniques were not that great. They would only be making fools of themselves if they were to go. However, since Shi Feng did not forsake them, what else did they have to say?Anticipation grew within Blackie. He was fortunate enough to dive a Dungeon together with the Snow Goddess. So what if he would shame himself? It would still be an honor when mentioned to others. Regardless of what others may say, they would be players who had gone Dungeon-diving with the Snow Goddess in the same party.White Sand Ruins, Stonehammer Town.When the Town Mayor Blackbeard saw Shi Feng entering, he went forward and greeted Shi Feng in a very welcoming manner.\u201cBrother Ye Feng, you\u2019ve come. The Fruit Juice you sold to me the last time was just too good! It captivated everyone in our little town. Now, we can\u2019t sleep properly if we don\u2019t drink a cup before bed every day,\u201d Blackbeard joked.\u201cLord Mayor Blackbeard, is this the Titan\u2019s Heart that you wanted?\u201d Shi Feng smiled, taking out the Titan\u2019s Heart as he asked.When Blackbeard saw the gray-colored, metallic sphere, his mouth suddenly opened wide in shock.This shape, this color, this texture\u2026 It was exactly the same as the Titan\u2019s Heart mentioned in the legends.\u201cCorrect, this is the Titan\u2019s Heart. It is exactly the same as the one recorded in the ancient records. I never thought that I would be able to personally see it in my lifetime. Brother Ye Feng, I truly did not think that you were such a powerful Adventurer. For bringing back our Blacksteel Dwarves\u2019 glory, I represent all Blacksteel Dwarves in thanking you sincerely,\u201d Blackbeard excitedly received the Titan\u2019s Heart, continuously thanking Shi Feng.System: Unique Quest \u201cSteel Fortress Barrutia\u201d completed. Rewarding 1 Blacksteel Insignia. Obtained Blackbeard\u2019s Recommendation Letter. Obtained Advanced Book of Magic. Rewarding 10,000 EXP. Reputation at Blacksteel Town has reached Worship.The large amount of rewards dazzled Shi Feng\u2019s eyes. His level had also risen to 73% of Level 6. Such a leveling speed had even exceeded that of those leveling madmen.Shi Feng did not care much about the amount of EXP. Instead, the other items were the most important ones.The rewards this time far exceeded Shi Feng\u2019s expectations. A Titan\u2019s Heart that possessed no energy in it could transform a third-rate Guild into a second-rate Guild. However, right now the Titan\u2019s Heart in Shi Feng\u2019s hands still possessed a quarter of its energy. Shi Feng never imagined the rewards to be so good.In his previous life, the player that completed this Unique Quest did not obtain such a bountiful reward. The player had only obtained a Recommendation Letter, an Intermediate Book of Magic, and reputation reaching the level of Worship. There was absolutely no Blacksteel\u2019s Insignia.[Blacksteel Insignia] (Fine-Gold rank)Unique EquipmentUser restriction: Ye FengThe[e] Blacksteel Insignia is the highest medal of honor amongst the Blacksteel Dwarves. After equipping it:Forging success rate increased by 5%.Proficiency has a 10% chance to increase by 1 extra point.When forging, there is a 1% chance to increase the forged item\u2019s Attributes.Shi Feng was shocked after looking at the introduction. This Blacksteel Insignia was literally a godly tool for forging. It was several degrees stronger than the Forging Talent. It was especially true with the 1% chance for an Attribute increase. That meant that, out of a hundred items forged, there would be one piece that would have its Attributes increased. If Shi Feng forged items everyday without stop, he would have no problem making three to four hundred pieces of equipment. In turn, he would have three to four pieces of equipment with their Attributes raised.The thing players compared most when playing games was the quality of their equipment. Even if the Attributes on a piece of equipment was only slightly higher, when the Attributes of all the other pieces of equipment were accumulated together, the total amount would allow a player to exceed the others by quite a lot. Regardless of whether it was PK or Dungeon-diving, the player would have a great advantage in both situations.Although Shi Feng did not know how much of an equipment\u2019s Attributes would be increased, even an increase of a single point would cause an equipment\u2019s price to increase by multiple percentages. If it was a big increase, then the price would increase by several folds; the price of a single piece of equipment could even rival the price of ten or more pieces.The Blacksteel Insignia was an unexpected profit. Shi Feng\u2019s main purpose for doing this Quest was to obtain the Book of Magic and Recommendation Letter, as both of these items were capable of allowing a Guild to rise up. It was especially true for the Book of Magic. Moreover, the one Shi Feng obtained was even an Advanced Book of Magic.Aside from forging equipment, Shi Feng could also forge other items, such as Armor Kits, Gemstone Buckles, Alchemy Wands, and much more. Amongst them, Armor Kits were the most popular and also had the largest demand.Generally, Armor Kits were capable of increasing either a Chestplate\u2019s Defense or Attributes. These all depended on the Armor Kit\u2019s quality and level. Meanwhile, the Book of Magic Shi Feng obtained from Blackbeard was for making the strengthened version of the Armor Kit: the Mana Armor Kit. The Book of Magic was a unique item, and there was only one of it in the entire God\u2019s Domain.In Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, it was exactly this item that had allowed a Guild to earn a large sum of money, turning it from a third-rate Guild into a second-rate Guild.As for Blackbeard\u2019s Recommendation Letter, it would only be useful in White River City, so Shi Feng was still unable to use it right now.however, now that Shi Feng\u2019s Reputation in Stonehammer Town had reached the level of Worship, he could purchase a few Bronze Equipment, and even Mysterious-Iron Equipment, that would bind to the player\u2019s character upon purchase. Moreover, the prices of these equipment items were very cheap, to the degree that even an average player at Level 10 could afford them. Stonehammer Town could be called the best location for players to obtain Mysterious-Iron Equipment. Hence, many players loved coming to this place to grind for Reputation. After their Reputation reached Worship, they would be able to gear themselves fully with Level 10 Mysterious-Iron Equipment.Unfortunately, it was not easy to grind for Reputation. It was almost impossible for anybody to fully equip themselves with Level 10 Mysterious-Iron Reputation Equipment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMoreover, a complete set of Mysterious-Iron Reputation Equipment was still somewhat weaker than the Bronze ranked Silvermoon Set Equipment. So, top-tier players all felt that it was below their dignity to equip it.Although Shi Feng would not be equipping these items, he still had other uses for them. For example, using them to level up the Abyssal Blade. The Abyssal Blade needed to devour Weapons in order to level up. According to his understanding, the better the quality of the Weapon devoured, the higher the increase in Attributes of the Abyssal Blade. The Abyssal Blade was like a cultivating weapon, hence the reason it was so much more powerful than those Epic ranked Weapons. They were even capable of rivaling Legendary Weapons.If Shi Feng nurtured it properly, the Abyssal Blade\u2019s Attributes could definitely surpass a Legendary Weapon. Sadly, too many items were required to carry out such a feat. Even if it was the Guild Leader of a second-rate Guild, they would not be able to support such a heavy cost. There was also the risk of facing a huge backlash. It was why many players both loved and hated Magic Weapons.In consideration for the Abyssal Blade\u2019s Attributes, instead of feeding it the original one piece of Level 5 Mysterious-Iron Weapon, and ten pieces of Level 5 Bronze Weapon, Shi Feng decided to buy eleven pieces of Level 5 Mysterious-Iron Weapon from the Weapon Shop. It was unknown how much of an increase in Attributes such an action would yield.Following which, Shi Feng called out the leveling interface for the Abyssal Blade. He then fed all these Weapons to the Abyssal Blade.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Countless black flames started emerging from the blade of the sword. The black flames then transformed into a dragon\u2019s head, immediately biting at the weapons that had been chosen. The dragon devoured the weapons, bite by bite.In the blink of an eye, the black flame devoured all eleven Mysterious-Iron Weapons, and all of their essences flowed into the Abyssal Blade. The Abyssal Blade no longer looked like a fire poker, and it now gave off a faint cold feeling of sharpness. The blade\u2019s color and luster had also become more rustic, similar to a blade covered in dust for many years.When Shi Feng held the Abyssal Blade once again, the weapon felt slightly heavier than before. He felt a refreshing feeling when his hand wrapped around the sword\u2019s hilt. Shi Feng then waved the sword a few times.Hua\u2026 Hua\u2026 Hua\u2026The air was like paper, creating tearing sounds as he sliced it apart.The boss of the Weapon Shop was also a forging expert. When he saw this, his mouth opened wide in shock. He even nearly pulled out his goatee.The ordinary-looking weapon was actually so sharp that it could easily surpass a Fine-Gold Weapon. If it were utilized properly, it might even be able to break apart a Bronze Weapon with a single slash.\u201cGood sword!\u201d Shi Feng waved the Abyssal Blade a few more times. After leveling up the sword, Shi Feng felt that it had become much more suitable for him. He then checked the Abyssal Blade\u2019s Attributes.\u2014[Abyssal Blade] (Magic Weapon, One-handed Sword)Attack Power 39All Attributes +14Attack Speed +5Ignore monster\u2019s level by 5 Levels.

Cooldown: 1 minuteAdditional Skill 3: Nine Dragons Slash. Instantly create nine phantoms of the Abyssal Blade for the wielder to use, each phantom sword is capable of dealing up to 30% damage. Duration of 24 seconds. Cooldown: 5 minutes.The Abyssal Blade was personally created by master smith Olysses using the Black Dragon King\u2019s fangs as material. It is one of thirty-six famed swords, and it is ranked 31st. However, this sword has been cursed by the Black Dragon King. Aside from being able to provide the wielder with immense strength, there will be a Backlash every period. However, after being remodeled by Jack using a Star Crystal, the strength of the Backlash has been greatly reduced. If the wielder is unable to suppress the Backlash, the wielder will receive the curse of the Black Dragon King, permanently reducing All Attributes by 50%. Unable to be dropped. Unable to be traded.\u2014The Abyssal Blade\u2019s Attributes increased by quite a lot. Just its Attack Power alone could rival a Level 5 Mysterious Iron Two-handed Weapon. With the Basic Attributes included, it would far exceed even a Level 5 Secret-Silver Two-handed Weapon.It was a One-handed Weapon that had the destructive power of a Two-handed Weapon. Moreover, a One-handed Sword was much lighter, and its speed was much faster. That meant the Abyssal Blade possessed both the destructive power of a Two-handed Weapon and at the same time, the lightness and speed of a One-handed Weapon. This was the terrifying part of Magic Weapons, and only master smiths were capable of forging such weapons.With such a result, Shi Feng was looking forward to the Abyssal Blade\u2019s rise to Level 10.Originally, Shi Feng intended to sell off the Level 10 Fine-Gold Greatsword he had obtained from the Sun Temple. However, he dismissed that notion. If he were to let the Abyssal Blade devour this weapon, he wondered just how much of an increase the Abyssal Blade would have.However, it was but a thought of Shi Feng\u2019s. To obtain an overall positive increase, it would not be possible just depending on a single weapon. Shi Feng would, at the very least, need to pair it up with ten Level 10 Secret-Silver Weapons. Currently, even Mysterious-Iron Weapons were as rare as a phoenix\u2019s feather, not to mention priceless Secret-Silver Weapons.After sheathing the Abyssal Blade, Shi Feng took out a Return Scroll and started chanting, returning to Red Leaf Town. If he were to run back instead, he would, with a 100% chance, be late. If he were to make the Snow Goddess wait for him, he dared not to think of the consequences\u2026Red Leaf Town, Trade Area.After Shi Feng transformed back to his original appearance, he made some minor adjustments to the appearance of the Silvermoon Set Equipment. It now looked more like an assembled set of Bronze Equipment. If Shi Feng were to appear in front of Gentle Snow with his original appearance, she would definitely find something fishy about it. At that time, Shi Feng would not find it easy to explain himself.\u201cBrother Feng, we\u2019re over here.\u201d Blackie stood up and shouted as he saw Shi Feng walking over.The others, as well, stood up to welcome Shi Feng when they saw him approaching, sending gazes of appreciation at him. If Shi Feng had not let Blackie carry them, they most likely would not have been able to reach Level 5 so quickly, and very likely, they would still be struggling at the bottom of the ranks.Currently, most of the veteran players in God\u2019s Domain were Level 4, and a minority had reached Level 5. However, there was nothing great about the equipment they were using. If veteran players were lucky, they might possess one or two pieces of Bronze Equipment that had good Attributes. Only those expert players would possess six or seven pieces of Bronze Equipment. On the other hand, every one of them now possessed seven or eight pieces of Bronze Equipment.Originally, this reason alone already caused them to be extremely grateful towards Shi Feng. They all decided to continue following Shi Feng. They never thought that Blackie would actually be willing to sign a contract with them, allowing them to join Zero Wing Workshop and become one of its official members. They could also enjoy a monthly salary of 4,000 Credits.They were not just fools playing a game. They knew the treatment an official member received in other Workshops. The treatment for official members of top-ranking Workshops in the city only received a monthly salary of 3,000 Credits. Even so, many veteran players would still try to worm themselves into these Workshops in whichever way they could. Meanwhile, they were just a bunch of fresh noobs, yet, they actually had a monthly salary of 4,000 Credits. This situation was just like a dream to them.Although they requested to lower the treatment they received, Blackie had firmly rejected all of them. He had said that Shi Feng had personally declared it as such, and no changes were permitted.Helpless, they could only sign the contract, becoming official members of Zero Wing Workshop.Although they looked well-off now, deep in their hearts, they were very clear about their own strengths. It was practically impossible for them to get invited to a Workshop. It would be a good thing if they could even become outer members, not to mention official members.Shi Feng swept a glance at everyone\u2019s equipment. Based on his many years of experience, he could roughly estimate an equipment\u2019s Attributes. The Basic Attributes of the equipment his party members were wearing had definitely exceeded the elite members of many small Guilds. However, it was still not enough, \u201cLet\u2019s make a trip to the Warehouse first.\u201dEveryone was confused. What were they going to do at the Warehouse?However, they did not question Shi Feng\u2019s decision, only following him.Arriving at the Bank, Shi Feng retrieved all the equipment that could be used by his party members. He obtained all of the equipment from the Treasure Chests he opened in the Moonlight Forest. Every piece of the equipment had extremely good Attributes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEveryone was dumbfounded when they saw the equipment. They had ceaselessly grinded monsters and had even killed quite a few Elites. Yet, all of their gains combined could not even rival the equipment Shi Feng had obtained by himself. The quality was, of course, much higher. It was all Level 5 Bronze Equipment, surpassing the Level 2 or Level 3 equipment they obtained by leaps and bounds.\u201cBrother Feng, how many Elite monsters did you actually kill?!\u201d Blackie\u2019s heart was filled with shock. However, he did not remain courteous as he swapped all his equipment that could be swapped. After doing so, the set of equipment on his person was just slightly weaker than a Level 5 Bronze Set Equipment. However, the Level 5 Mysterious-Iron Staff he wielded easily made up for this gap.The other party members also fully swapped out their equipment. Their Basic Attributes right now far surpassed those of the elite members of large Guilds.Every one of them had exchanged their shotguns for cannons. Even if they were to enter a twenty-man Dungeon right now, they would still be full of confidence.Shi Feng examined through everyone\u2019s Attributes once, nodding his head in satisfaction as he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97 \u2013 Gathering of HeroesDark Moon Valley, Dark Moon Graveyard.Countless tombstones stood around a dilapidated chapel. In the midst of night, one could hear wails of agony coming out from the tombstones. Meanwhile, Kobold Assassins roamed the dark and hidden locations around the broken down chapel.This place was the most famous location of Dark Moon Valley.Due to this place being the closest and the first twenty-man Team Dungeon activated near Red Leaf Town, it held high importance to the many Guilds stationed in Red Leaf Town. Compared to the previous six-man Party Dungeon, the various Guilds were paying the most attention to this Team Dungeon.That was because Team Dungeons and Party Dungeons were different. Not only was the difficulty for Team Dungeons higher, but the equipment that dropped from them was also better. Moreover, only by clearing a Team Dungeon would a Guild be able to prove their strength. Aside from that, there was a gigantic Glory List beside the Teleportation Gate of every Team Dungeon. On it, the names of the Team and players who obtained the First Clear for the Dungeon would be listed for latecomers to admire.Of course, aside from the First Clear, the record for the fastest to clear the Dungeon would also be recorded, with the reserved record set at three hours. As long as a team surpassed the record time, their names would be recorded. However, this record was not permanent, but only temporary. As long as another team could obtain an even shorter record time, they would replace the current holders of the record.Currently, players filled all of the Dark Moon Graveyard. Aside from the various large Guilds from Red Leaf town, there were plenty of temporary groups attempting to challenge this Team Dungeon.\u201cWow! It\u2019s just as expected of the competition for the First Clear of the Team Dungeon. The equipment on these guys is just too gorgeous! Our temporary group has no chance of competing against them at all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s only natural. Why don\u2019t you look at just how many times these Guilds have cleared the Level 3 to Level 4 Party Dungeons? Even the team belonging to the weakest Guild here would have seven to eight pieces of Bronze Equipment on each party member. Look at Martial Union over there; all of their members are wearing Bronze Equipment. Their leader, Ironsword Lion, is wearing the Wolf Fang Set Equipment that can only be obtained from the Level 4 Dungeon, Black Wolf\u2019s Den.\u201d\u201cIronsword Lion\u2019s equipment could be considered quite good amongst the unrated Guilds. However, look over there at the third-rate Guild, Heaven\u2019s Crowns. The equipment on their elite team\u2019s vice-leader, Passenger of Wind, is the Spirit Wind Set Equipment obtained from the Level 4 Advanced Dungeon, Ghost Fortress.\u201dThe players of temporary teams gazed at the equipment of the Guild teams in envy. They spoke about the items as if enumerating their own family\u2019s valuables, and the more they spoke, the more drool leaked out from the corner of their mouths.Only the Elite parties of Guilds could clear those high difficulty Party Dungeons. Unaffiliated individuals like themselves could only look on with envy.Just as everyone was sighing in admiration at the equipment of these elite teams, Stabbing Heart of Assassin\u2019s Alliance led a group of players over. The equipment of the group was extremely unified. All twenty players wore the same Level 4 Bronze Equipment. Amongst them, the two silver daggers hung around Stabbing Heart\u2019s waist looked extraordinarily radiant.\u201cCrap, it can\u2019t be, right? Those are Gemini\u2019s Thorns that only drop from the final Boss of the Hard Mode of Ghost Fortress,\u201d an Assassin who was a dagger-fanatic cried out in shock.Suddenly, the team leaders and upper echelons of the other Guilds all cast sidelong glances over to Stabbing Heart.This design and color were exactly the same as the information displayed on the official announcement.\u201cAs expected of a second-rate Guild; the Assassin\u2019s Alliance\u2019s strength cannot be taken lightly. They managed to clear the Hard Mode of Ghost Fortress without anyone noticing. Meanwhile, until now, we have merely killed off the first Boss of Hard Mode,\u201d Passenger of Wind sighed with regret.\u201cHumph! So what if they managed to clear the Hard Mode? We will still start from the same starting point from now on. The difficulty of a Team Dungeon is not something a Party Dungeon can compare to. Clearing it depends more on the commands given,\u201d Ironsword Lion wrinkled his brows, snorting in disdain. He believed that his own techniques were no weaker than Stabbing Heart\u2019s. If he had not been ambushed by that Ye Feng, causing him to lose a level, the party he led might have been able to clear the Hard Mode of Ghost Fortress.\u201cInteresting,\u201d when Shadow\u2019s leader, Zhang Luowei, heard the discussions of the other Guilds, a faint smile appeared on his face. He was immensely arrogant, as if he did not place importance on any of these players.The various Guilds present were unwilling to comply with each other. After all, God\u2019s Domain had only recently begun; nobody would know what the future would bring. The Assassin\u2019s Alliance was only this powerful due to their strong initial foundation. However, the First Clear for the Dark Moon Graveyard could not be obtained just by relying on a strong foundation. At best, the Assassin\u2019s Alliance would only have a minor advantage over the other Guilds.The First Clear of this Team Dungeon this time around was considered a shuffling of power in Red Leaf Town. Whoever obtained the First Clear would increase their prestige in Red Leaf Town, improving their Guild\u2019s development. It would have a great effect on attracting new players to join their Guilds.Everyone looked at the time. There was still over twenty minutes before the opening of Dark Moon Graveyard. They all stood by a side, patiently waiting.\u201cSister Snow, this place is really lively!\u201d Xiao Yue\u2019er giggled, pulling on Gentle Snow\u2019s delicate arm as she took a look at her surroundings.Gentle Snow nodded. She looked around with an indifferent face, her expression as cold as ice. She did not pay any attention to the Guilds present. Instead, she was looking for a certain someone.Although Gentle Snow and her group kept a low profile when they arrived at the Dark Moon Graveyard, everyone\u2019s sights still unconsciously turned towards the group; including the upper echelons of the various Guilds.They still possessed the chance to compete in the case of second-rate Guilds. However, it was but a fleeting dream for them to compete against a first-rate Guild. The main reason being the gap between a first-rate Guild and a second-rate Guild was just too wide. Not only was there a difference in the number of players in the Guild, but there was also the difference of the quality of players and fundings.Just by standing in this place, Gentle Snow caused a great pressure to loom over the upper echelons of the many Guilds present. As for the cause for this pressure, aside from the disparity between their Guilds, the disparity between personal strength was also one of the causes. As long as one played virtual reality games, they would certainly know of the Snow Goddess. However, this name was not praise for Gentle Snow\u2019s stunning complexion, but for her frightening strength.\u201cAs expected of the Snow Goddess. The equipment on her body is likely the most top-notch equipment available to players at this stage of the game,\u201d Stabbing Heart inwardly admired the silver-red battle armor that Gentle Snow wore.This was the Flame Light Set Equipment that could only be obtained from the Level 5 Advanced Dungeon, Lava Cavern. The Assassin\u2019s Alliance was never able to clear this Dungeon. Moreover, this Flame Light Set was a Mysterious-Iron Set Equipment that would only drop from the Hard Mode of the Dungeon.The Set Equipment was much better than any other equipment, not to mention the crimson-colored Flame Spirit Greatsword in Gentle Snow\u2019s hands. That was a Level 5 Secret-Silver Two-handed Sword. The weapon itself could easily overwhelm his pair of Mysterious-Iron ranked Gemini\u2019s Thorns.The pressure this set of equipment gave off to the other experts present was enormous. In addition to Zhao Yueru and Xiao Yue\u2019er\u2019s Mysterious-Iron Equipment, Gentle Snow\u2019s group practically flattened everyone else at the Dark Moon Graveyard. How were these experts supposed to compete against Gentle Snow\u2019s group now?\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he here yet?\u201d after taking a look around, a faint layer of frost appeared on Gentle Snow\u2019s face as she was unable to discover Shi Feng\u2019s figure anywhere.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHahaha! Snow, that guy must\u2019ve known that he would just humiliate himself, so he didn\u2019t dare show up. Why don\u2019t we just call a few more members over?\u201d Zhao Yueru stuck out her impressive twin peaks, laughing delightfully.Gentle Snow gave Zhao Yueru\u2019s words some thought. The First Clear for the Dark Moon Graveyard was extremely important. If Shi Feng really was not coming, then she should be making some preparations ahead of time.Just as Gentle Snow was prepared to contact her subordinates, Shi Feng and his party ran over.\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve made you all wait,\u201d Shi Feng scratched his head, apologizing.Although he hurried over, the distance was just too far. Moreover, they had met a Level 5 Extremely Rare Elite on the way here, so they had wasted some time\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98 \u2013 Whetstone RecipeAfter not meeting for just more than a day, Shi Feng discovered that Gentle Snow and the others of her group had changed their equipment. All of them were wearing gorgeous equipment. The Level 5 Flame Light Set Equipment all of them were wearing was the best team equipment currently available.[a][b]With this equipment, as long as the team leader commanded properly, they would definitely conquer the Normal Mode of Dark Moon Valley after familiarizing themselves with the Dungeon.Regarding the Dark Moon Graveyard\u2026Even if Shi Feng now possessed a full suit of Silvermoon Set Equipment, he still had quite a lot of requirements. For instance, the Advanced Whetstone Recipe. This was the strengthened version of the Whetstone. The Recipe for this item could only be obtained from Team Dungeons. Moreover, only Bosses of the Dungeon would have a chance of dropping it.\u201cYou still remembered to come\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Since you\u2019re already here, leave your party, and we\u2019ll reform the group.\u201dZhao Yueru originally wanted to taunt Shi Feng, but Gentle Snow stopped her a step earlier.Gentle Snow was still slightly angry from before, but after sweeping a glance at Shi Feng, she shockingly discovered that Shi Feng had reached Level 6.Currently, the Level 6 players in all of Red Leaf Town were top-tier players.Previously, when she met Shi Feng, his level was nothing special. It was just below average. Now that he was able to catch up to such a degree, one could see that Shi Feng\u2019s leveling speed was extremely fast. As for Blackie and the others standing behind Shi Feng, all of them were Level 5. They were also fully geared with Bronze Equipment, and such a standard was relatively good amongst temporary teams.Shi Feng\u2019s party then disbanded, all of them joining Gentle Snow\u2019s team.All of the surrounding Guilds and players saw Shi Feng join Gentle Snow\u2019s team. Judging from the equipment of Shi Feng\u2019s party, it was obvious that Shi Feng and the others were not members of Ouroboros. However, it was extremely odd that they were still able to join Gentle Snow\u2019s team and enter the Dungeon together.The equipment worn by Shi Feng\u2019s party did not seem very high-leveled. They wore only scattered pieces of Bronze Equipment, not that different from the equipment of a temporary team.This was the important struggle for the First Clear of a Team Dungeon. Was Gentle Snow so confident in being able to easily obtain it that she\u2019d invite a group of people like this?Only Stabbing Heart knew of Shi Feng\u2019s strength. Now that both powerhouses had joined, the competition for the First Clear of the Dark Moon Graveyard had just become much harder.\u201cBrother Zhang, that\u2019s the brat that set up our men,\u201d Flaming Tiger hatefully commented when he saw Shi Feng.\u201cSo, it is him?\u201d Zhang Luowei raised his brows. He could not help but pay more attention to Shi Feng. He then said in a deep tone, \u201cSince he has some connection with the Snow Goddess, try not to stir up trouble with them in the future. I don\u2019t wish for us to go against a first-rate Guild right now.\u201dBeing able to wipe out Flaming Tiger\u2019s group, and having a connection with the Snow Goddess, this person was not that simple. He still needed to do some investigations of this person. If this person had just joined the Snow Goddess by chance, he would definitely make this person pay for his actions.\u201cYes, I understand, Brother Zhang.\u201d Flaming Tiger glared at Shi Feng, only gritting his teeth as he answered.However, it was a different situation on the side of Martial Union.Every member of Martial Union could not help but wish they could get rid of Shi Feng right that instant. It was especially true for Ironsword Lion.Previously, he put out the word that he would kill Shi Feng back to Level 0. Now that he saw Shi Feng had already reached Level 6, one level higher than Ironsword Lion, himself, he felt extremely humiliated.\u201cWhat is that group of Assassins doing? They actually allowed him to wash away his Red Name, and even rise to Level 6.\u201d Just the fact that Shi Feng was standing in this place, unscathed, caused the light on Ironsword Lion\u2019s face to fade. His face turned crimson from anger, saying, \u201cImmediately contact the party of Assassins. What exactly is going on here?\u201d\u201cBoss, what\u2019s up?\u201d one of the Assassins standing guard in front of the Hotel asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Ironsword Lion nearly suffocated from anger when he heard those words. He bellowed, \u201cI told you all to pay attention to Ye Feng, yet, what have you all been doing?\u201d\u201cBoss, we\u2019ve constantly been keeping an eye out for him. However, Ye Feng has not set foot outside the Hotel. I\u2019m guessing that he must be afraid,\u201d the Assassin said, puzzled.\u201cYou\u2019ve constantly been keeping an eye out for him? Then you tell me; who is this person that I am looking at?\u201d Ironsword Lion sent a screenshot, asking coldly.\u201cImpossible! We\u2019ve really been constantly keeping an eye out for Ye Feng, and he never came out!\u201d The Assassin, immediately dumbfounded, looked at the screenshot.\u201cYou\u2019re a bunch of rubbish that can\u2019t even keep watch over a single person! Get out of Martial Union immediately! I don\u2019t wish to see you any longer!\u201d rage completely flooded Ironsword Lion\u2019s mind. Shortly after, he turned to glare at Shi Feng, saying to his subordinate, \u201cCall some men over, as many as you can. After they\u2019re done with the Dungeon, I want him dead immediately.\u201d\u201cBoss Ironsword, this wouldn\u2019t be a good move, right? No matter how you put it, he still has some connection with the Snow Goddess. If we create a bad relationship with Ouroboros, it would be detrimental to the development of our Guild,\u201d a Druid said.\u201cOut in the streets, we live by depending on our reputation. Now that someone has stomped our reputation to the ground, who cares about anything else?\u201d Ironsword Lion said in disdain, \u201cSo what if she\u2019s the Snow Goddess? She still hasn\u2019t met this daddy right here. I don\u2019t believe that a stupid skank like her could do much to me. If she knows how to be tactful, I can still give her some face. If not, then I\u2019ll kill her back to Level 0 as well.\u201d\u201cBoss is right! God\u2019s Domain just has slightly more players. How prestigious was it during those years that we swept across Martial World? Now, we can also sweep across God\u2019s Domain just like before. What should we be afraid of?\u201dThe players that had constantly followed Ironsword Lion all voiced out their agreements, all of them releasing the aura of a mad dog from their bodies.In their opinion, one had to be fierce when playing virtual reality games. Compared to Wuxia games, God\u2019s Domain merely had more players. Moreover, they had to take into consideration so many problems every single day. What good was worrying about each and every little thing? Won\u2019t everything be solved if they just killed these first-rate Guilds into submission? They had only depended on being fierce to succeed in the previous Wuxia game they played, and it would be the same in God\u2019s Domain.Only the Druid, who had only recently joined, helplessly shook his head.These people were insane!Shi Feng did not notice the movements of Martial Union. He only discussed the matter of cooperation with Gentle Snow.\u201cThe items dropped from the Dungeon will be distributed according to Job requirements. If both sides require the same equipment, then there should be no problem if we just Roll for it, right?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have any problems with the distribution of equipment. However, I want priority over the recipes and materials for Lifestyle Jobs.\u201d Shi Feng\u2019s goal in coming here was the Advanced Whetstone Recipe, while equipment didn\u2019t really matter to him.\u201cYou! Don\u2019t forget that we are the ones who will be carrying you through the Dungeon! Moreover, do you know how valuable the recipes for Lifestyle Jobs are?\u201d After hearing Shi Feng\u2019s words, Zhao Yueru stamped her feet in anger, bellowing like a fierce tigress.The other members of Gentle Snow\u2019s team were also feeling aggrieved. Shi Feng and his party were just a group of wild players[1]. They were already extremely benevolent by Rolling to distribute the equipment. Despite that fact, Shi Feng was still trying to take advantage of them.\u201cBrother Feng, your request is going slightly overboard. In any case, our equipment is slightly weaker than theirs, and even just clearing the Dungeon would be a problem for us. So why don\u2019t you change your requirements?\u201d Blackie advised.Although their equipment was very good, compared to the Set Equipment of these people, they were clearly still a step behind. Being able to Roll for equipment was already a good condition. Going further to compete over recipes for Lifestyle Jobs\u2026 Nobody would be willing to concede to such a request.To put it bluntly, even without them joining, Gentle Snow\u2019s team could similarly clear the Dark Moon Graveyard.Shi Feng shook his head. He would not mind if it were any other recipes. However, he would not concede even a single step for the Advanced Whetstone Recipe. He also could not reveal any specifics to avoid attracting the suspicion of others. After all, before a Team Dungeon was conquered, the Official Website would not reveal any information about its drops.Twenty-man Dungeons would only refresh once every three days. There were only that many Team Dungeons nearby, and every one of them was extremely precious. The earlier Shi Feng obtained the Advanced Whetstone Recipe, the earlier he would obtain an advantage over the other players. To a Workshop like theirs that lived on the edge, they had even more reasons not to concede.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGentle Snow, who had an ice-cold expression, also opened up her mouth this time around, saying, \u201cRecipes for Lifestyle Jobs are extremely important to our Guild.

Although their influence towards God\u2019s Domain was small right now, who could guarantee that it would remain so in the future?Hence, she would not let even a single recipe that dropped from the Dungeon slip by.With Gentle Snow\u2019s approval, the confidence of the members of Ouroboros grew. Every one of them looked towards the foolish-looking Shi Feng.Now that our leader has refused, let\u2019s see how you are going to continue acting arrogant! If you have the ability, then form your own team to enter the Dark Moon Graveyard. We will have an easier time that way as well.Shi Feng slightly wrinkled his brows. He did not think that Gentle Snow would be so resolute. He wondered what had happened to Gentle Snow to trigger a nerve in her. She was completely different from when they first met. At that time, there was still room for discussion.However, Shi Feng did not have a clue that the person who triggered Gentle Snow was exactly himself\u2026\u201cHow about this, then? We\u2019ll hold a party auction for the Lifestyle recipes that drop,\u201d Shi Feng said. Without having any better options, he could only take a step back and make some compromises.Hearing Shi Feng, Zhao Yueru covered her delicate mouth as she revealed a shallow smile.\u201cYe Feng, stop dreaming. Team Dungeons only reset once every three days. The recipes obtained from inside are extremely important to a Guild\u2019s development. How could we auction them amongst the party? If you insist on doing so, then we will just call in a few more of our elite members. That way, those enter the Dark Moon Graveyard will all be our members, and we won\u2019t need to share anything with you,\u201d Zhao Yueru\u2019s tone turned chilling.Zhao Yueru had already made her words extremely clear: If you are going to stay, then forget about the recipes. Otherwise, pack up and leave. We won\u2019t be obstructing you on your way.Meanwhile, Gentle Snow showed no signs of hindering Zhao Yueru. Her actions meant that she, too, agreed with Zhao Yueru\u2019s viewpoint.\u201cMiss Zhao, please don\u2019t get angry. Brother Feng doesn\u2019t know how important the recipes are to you all. I apologize.\u201d Blackie could no longer stand to watch this scene continue to unfold. Any more of this, and the final result would definitely be a separation. They managed to obtain the favor of the Snow goddess after much difficulty. Hence, they could not simply just let go of this chance to further advance their Workshop.Blackie continuously hinted Shi Feng not to act rashly and to properly grab ahold of this chance.Shi Feng could feel Gentle Snow\u2019s resolute behavior. Such an attitude gave him a headache. However, it would not be easy for him to find another team to enter the Dark Moon Graveyard with. It was a Team Dungeon, after all. A certain standard of equipment, trust, and cooperation was required to successfully clear it. Moreover, players that were abruptly recruited might not necessarily be reliable. They might even bring adverse effects to the team.\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s go with your arrangements.\u201d It was clearly not wise for him to enter a deadlock with Gentle Snow right now. Shi Feng had no choice but to just give up this chance. His only choice was to look for new, reliable members after he finished the Dungeon. He would then bring them to dive into other Team Dungeons.Seeing Shi Feng agree, Blackie let loose a breath of relief. On the other hand, Zhao Yueru was slightly pouting. She inwardly felt unfortunate that she was not able to chase Shi Feng away.Gentle Snow did not pay attention to Zhao Yueru\u2019s irritation. The time for the Dungeon\u2019s opening already arrived. The other Guild teams were all entering the Dungeon, one after another. Hence, Gentle Snow said in the team chat, \u201cLet\u2019s go in then.\u201dBefore entering the Dungeon, Gentle Snow had set the Dungeon\u2019s difficulty at Normal. That way, after entering the Teleportation Gate, everyone would be sent to the Normal Mode of the Dark Moon Graveyard.Team Dungeons were similar to Party Dungeons, in which they had three different difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Hell. However, Guilds that were not familiar with the Dungeon would usually start off by obtaining and understanding information from the Normal Mode of the Dungeon. They would then use the information obtained to prepare for Hard Mode and Hell Mode.Right now, every Guild was competing for the First Clear of the Dark Moon Graveyard. They wanted to use this chance to increase their influence towards the players in Red Leaf Town. So, naturally, they would not start off by challenging a higher difficulty.The team entered the Teleportation Gate, one after another. They all turned into a streak of white light as they entered the Dark Moon Graveyard.Team Dungeons were unlike Party Dungeons. The map inside a Team Dungeon was extremely large. They were practically the same size as a small Town, with some being the same size as a city with a population in the millions.The Dark Moon Graveyard was the first Team Dungeon available near Red Leaf Town, so the map of the Dungeon was relatively small.Unlike the Team Dungeons in other virtual reality games, the main goal when entering any Team Dungeons in God\u2019s Domain was to find the exit. As long as players could find the exit and leave the Dungeon, then they would have cleared the Dungeon. After leaving the Dungeon, they would also receive the corresponding Dungeon rewards.Dark Moon Graveyard was different precisely because of this reason. Taking into consideration that this was the first time players of God\u2019s Domain came into contact with Team Dungeons, the Dark Moon Graveyard\u2019s difficulty was lower than other Team Dungeons. Players only needed to consider one key point when inside the Dungeon.Survive!As long as they could survive and leave through the exit, they would clear the Dungeon.Immediately after everyone entered the Dark Moon Graveyard, a chilling wind ambushed them, causing their entire bodies to shiver.It was past dusk in this place, and a red moon hung above the sky, shining down on the earth. Gravestones littered the wasteland, and the gigantic stones formed one gigantic maze. A strange atmosphere filled the place, coupled with countless wails of anguish.\u201cI\u2019ll divide up our responsibilities first, so when the time comes, just make sure you do your own part.\u201d Gentle Snow was not even the slightest bit shocked by the strange atmosphere. Instead, the corners of her lips curved upwards, forming an excited smile.Although they wasted several minutes, they properly determined each team member\u2019s responsibilities. That way, whenever anything unexpected occurred, everyone could react with the quickest time possible.The team had a total of four healers, with two being Clerics, one Oracle, and one Druid.There were two MTs in the team. One of them was a Shield Warrior; the other, a Guardian Knight.Meanwhile, Shi Feng was arranged into the Dagger Party. The party\u2019s main goal was to combat at the frontlines. On the other hand, Lonely Snow was arranged into the Protection Party. Their main goal was to protect the team\u2019s lifeline, the healers.\u201cAlright, Scout Party, search for a path. We will follow behind at a slower pace.\u201d Once Gentle Snow was satisfied with the team\u2019s formation, she arranged for two Assassins to scout ahead.After entering the wasteland maze, the two Assassins immediately reported the situation they discovered. Gentle Snow responded immediately, allowing her team to advance towards the best possible route and easily avoid the traps set up by the Kobold Assassins and Kobold Warriors.[Kobold Assassin] (Common rank)Level 5HP 1,600/1,600[Kobold Warrior] (Elite rank)Level 5HP 3,500/3,500If they triggered the trap here, they would have to go up against more than thirty Kobold Assassins and seven or eight Elite Kobold Warriors. Such a situation would definitely cause major losses to the team.Thanks to Gentle Snow\u2019s quick decisions, the team inched closer and closer towards the maze\u2019s exit. On the way, they only needed to kill a small amount of Kobolds. Even Shi Feng was slightly shocked by Gentle Snow\u2019s leadership. It was as if all matters within the Dark Moon Graveyard were within the palms of her hands.Zhao Yueru walked up to Shi Feng\u2019s side, proudly saying, \u201cWhat do you think? You should see how far apart your strengths are now, right?\u201dShi Feng remained silent. He did not pay much heed to Zhao Yueru, his hand only tightening its grip on his treasured sword hanging on his waist.\u201cHumph! Speechless now, are you?\u201d Zhao Yueru thought Shi Feng was tacitly agreeing, her heart feeling a wave of pleasure.However, not long after Zhao Yueru felt pleased with herself, two blood-curling screams came through the team\u2019s chat.\u201cScout Party, what happened?\u201d Gentle Snow hurriedly asked.System: Player White Cry has died.System: Player Wind Shadow has died.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d When Zhao Yueru saw that the two players who died were both from the Scout Party, her heart filled with questions.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, nobody answered Zhao Yueru.Due the settings of God\u2019s Domain, players were unable to initiate communication after death.Everyone immediately tensed up. They watched their surroundings vigilantly.The mysterious deaths of the two players informed the members of Ouroboros of one thing.Both players who died had very good techniques. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have become elite members of Ouroboros. Their sudden deaths and the lack of even the slightest information could only mean one thing\u2026 this place had become extremely dangerous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100 \u2013 Go Ahead, If You Can\u201cEveryone, pay attention to your surroundings! Healers, stand in the middle! Protection Party, guard the healers! MTs, prepare to activate your lifesaving skills at any time! Dagger Party, prepare for battle!\u201d Gentle Snow was not frightened by the situation. She immediately gave out commands, staying combat ready.Haughtiness invites disaster; humility receives benefit.This sentence just happened to be applicable to the members of Ouroboros. It was especially true for the arrogant Zhao Yueru.Problems were bound to occur when one became complacent.Only, the problems, this time, arrived somewhat too quickly.Zhao Yueru, who was still relaxed, suddenly tightened her grip on her Crystal Staff. She was no longer acting cheerful or witty; her expression now turned solemn. She observed her surroundings for every little detail, revealing the unquestionable quality of an expert.The other members of Ouroboros also no longer dared be careless. Although they were confident in their equipment, even possessing the confidence to overcome the Dark Moon Graveyard, this confidence still gradually faded after the two players were instantly killed. They could not help but become cautious and timid.As for Shi Feng\u2019s party, they were even more nervous. Inside their hearts, they were still considering themselves to be a bunch of noobs. Meanwhile, the elite members of Ouroboros before them were experts. Their techniques surpassed them by leaps and bounds.However, such experts that wore top-tier Set Equipment still died an unfathomable death.This Dark Moon Graveyard was just too horrifying!Seeing everyone in such a panic, Shi Feng remained incomparably calm. As for what actually happened, nobody had a better understanding of it than him, or rather, he long since predicted such a situation.Since Dark Moon Graveyard had a lower difficulty, depending on equipment and some experts, it was easy enough that it could be relaxingly cleared. However, in Shi Feng\u2019s previous life, an unknown number of Guilds fell to the dungeon over and over, to the degree of cursing someone\u2019s mother. Based on the strength of Gentle Snow\u2019s team, they would still be able to clear the Dungeon, even after being team-wiped over a dozen times. Only, the price to pay for such an action was very high.\u201cSomething\u2019s coming. MTs, pay attention,\u201d Shi Feng warned. He squinted his eyes, looking towards the fog that floated nearer.Everyone abruptly tensed, looking over.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d The Shield Warrior discovered a blurry figure inside the mist.The figure was hidden inside the murky fog, preventing anybody from getting a clear look at it. The team only knew that the thing was gradually wobbling closer, step after step, crawling as slow as a snail. As the distance between the two sides shortened, the wails of anguish became louder, causing all those present to have goosebumps.Just when the figure was about to leave the fog\u2026\u201cMTs activate your lifesaving skills!\u201d Shi Feng yelled.However, the Shield Warrior paid no attention to Shi Feng\u2019s words.He had always looked down upon Shi Feng in his heart. The last time they met, Shi Feng was just a noob who got lucky. Shi Feng was only able to attract their leader\u2019s attention because he familiarized himself with God\u2019s Domain ahead of time. Although Shi Feng was currently reached Level 6, he had definitely depended on his familiarity with the Quests and monsters in order to level up so quickly. He did not truly possess strength.Even if Shi Feng\u2019s skills were good, the number of experts Ouroboros had recruited over the years from other virtual reality games exceeded five thousand. They were not lacking people such as Shi Feng at all. In other words, within Ouroboros, there were plenty of players that were much better than Shi Feng.Although the Shield Warrior did not pay attention to Shi Feng\u2019s words, the Guardian Knight, Cola, had always trusted in Shi Feng. He had, at the first instance, activated Protection Blessing on himself.Just as the figure within the fog was about to reveal itself, two black rays of light shot out from the fog, reaching the MTs on the frontlines in the blink of an eye.These two rays of light were as swift as bullets. The bulky MTs had no way of dodging them.At that moment, Gentle Snow only shouted, \u201cMTs, use your lifesaving skills!\u201dUnfortunately, Gentle Snow was still one step behind.One of the black rays immediately pierced the Shield Warrior\u2019s body, a damage of -1,600 appearing above his head. He was killed instantly.The Shield Warrior\u2019s eyes affixed to his chest where the black ray penetrated, unwillingly passing on.Meanwhile, after activating Protection Blessing, the damage Cola received reduced by 50%. In addition to the Secret-Silver ranked Sky Armor that he received from Shi Feng, Cola only received slightly more than -500 damage, losing slightly more than half of his HP.Everyone was dumbfounded after seeing this. A Level 5 MT wearing Bronze Set Equipment died, just like that.Meanwhile, more figures started appearing out of the fog.When Gentle Snow recalled the terrifying black rays from before, she immediately commanded, \u201cHealers, heal! Everyone retreat. Guardian Knight, cover everyone else\u2019s retreat. Anybody with a Defense Skill, pay attention and protect the Guardian Knight.\u201dHearing Gentle Snow\u2019s commands, Cola hesitated slightly. He turned to look at Shi Feng, intending to wait for Shi Feng\u2019s command.\u201cRetreat then. Pay attention to your positioning and maintain a straight line with the people behind,\u201d Shi Feng nodded his head.After receiving Shi Feng\u2019s orders, Cola immediately took action.Seeing such a scene, Gentle Snow felt slightly upset in her heart. However, she did not voice it.On the other hand, Zhao Yueru was not as willing. A noob like you, instead of listening to Snow\u2019s commands, you actually listened to that lucky dog shit\u2019s words? Was he trying to imply that the Snow Goddess\u2019 strength and commands weren\u2019t as reliable as Shi Feng\u2019s?However, just as Zhao Yueru was about to open her mouth, she immediately snapped it closed.That was because, while Cola was retreating, he was actually able to simultaneously use his shield to block the black rays that fired towards the other players. He was even able to dodge the attacks of the black rays while, at the same time, retreating in an orderly manner. Such a feat was absolutely impossible for a fresh noob to accomplish. His skills were even better than their own Shield Warrior\u2019s by a thread.With four healers healing him, Cola was able to maintain his HP above the safety line. During the occasional desperate moments, Shi Feng would use Parry to help Cola block the black rays, allowing Cola to retain his life.Such scenes caused the members of Ouroboros, who had been previously dissatisfied with Shi Feng, to have a change of heart. They questioned whether they were able to carry out such actions. Moreover, Shi Feng rescued Cola multiple times now, proving that it was not just a coincidence, but skill.As long as Cola did not die, the remaining team members would remain safe. It could be said that Shi Feng was holding onto the lives of the entire team.\u201cIt would seem\u2026that I have still been underestimating him.\u201d Gentle Snow started viewing Shi Feng in a different light. Although she, too, helped Cola block some attacks, her actions were not as natural and pleasant as Shi Feng\u2019s. He was capable of blocking the attacks while not hindering Cola\u2019s movements.After everyone retreated some distance, they were finally able to clearly see the figures within the fog.They had gigantic bodies with the height of two people. Their arms were both equipped with black, metallic claws. When they attacked, their claws were like swords shooting forth and sheathing quickly after, all within a blink of an eye.[Kobold Zombie] (Special Elite) Level 6HP 5,000/5,000Just a single Kobold Zombie was headache to them. However, there were a total of six Kobold Zombies that appeared from the fog. Such numbers practically demanded their lives. To make matters worse, a group of Kobold Warriors also appeared in their path of retreat.Everyone finally understood the difficulty of a Team Dungeon. Its difficulty was practically over ten times that of a Party Dungeon.\u201cWe\u2019re finished,\u201d Zhao Yueru felt despair in her heart when she saw the number of Elites and Special Elites, \u201cHow are we supposed to fight this many Elites and Special Elites? Moreover, they have both ranged and melee to cooperate with each other.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe other team members similarly agreed with Zhao Yueru\u2019s opinion.\u201cIs there no way for us to pass through?\u201d Gentle Snow creased her brows. She was unwilling to just leave the Dungeon like this.At that moment, Shi Feng opened his mouth, saying, \u201cIf we utilise the terrain properly and cooperate well with each other, it is not entirely impossible.\u201dThe members of Ouroboros felt displeasure in their hearts when they heard Shi Feng. He was wholly mocking the inability of Gentle Snow\u2019s commands.\u201cEasier said than done. Who would know how to deal with this many Elites and Special Elites? Go ahead, if you can,\u201d Zhao Yueru sneered, looking at Shi Feng with disdain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
