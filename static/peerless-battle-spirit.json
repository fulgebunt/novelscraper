Only through the awakening of their Martial Spirit would they be able to communicate with the Heaven and Earth and absorb the Spiritual Qi in order to progress in their cultivation.There exists many different kinds of Martial Spirits, simply too many to count. They were separated into four great ranks: Huang, Xuan, Di and Tian. These ranks were divided even further into ten more grades.The higher the rank of the Martial Spirit, the stronger the speed, capability, and potential of the cultivation. Thus, the chances of becoming a formidable expert in the future would be even greater.Presently, in Luo River Kingdom, Linshui City, the Qin Clan were holding a Martial Spirit Awakening Ceremony.Atop a pitch black altar sat a cross-legged disciple with handsome facial features and his face filled with pride. Beneath the altar was a crowd of the Qin Clan\u2019s disciples as well as their elders.This disciple was \u2019Qin Changkong\u2019, he was the son of the Qin Clan\u2019s Supreme Elder. Within the Qin Clan, he was only second to the Young Lord of the Qin Clan, Qin Nan.For that reason, the disciples around him, as well as the elders, held a hint of expectation on their faces.At this moment, the pitch black altar began to move as it emitted threads of white light. It was like a dream, like a fantasy; it was as if it had manifested into large transparent serpents, making its way into Qin Changkong\u2019s body. One could see it incessantly circulate within his body with just the naked eye.Hu!The roar of a majestic beast suddenly resounded from Qin Changkong\u2019s body. \\nImmediately, yellow rays protruded from the back of Qin Changkong\u2019s body. When the fifth yellow ray appeared, the silhouette of a colossal, fierce and malevolent white tiger manifested. It was as if the King of Beasts had descended upon them and issued a ferocious and formidable roar.At this moment, all the elders and disciples present felt a huge sense of oppression.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d The elder responsible for the ceremony was dumbstruck before immediately composing himself. He wore an incomparably excited expression as he cried out, \u201cFive golden rays! Five golden rays! This is a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit! A fifth-grade Huang ranked Beast Martial Spirit!\u201dThis sentence was like a bolt of frightening thunder as it was thrown into the crowd of people, causing the complexions of the entire crowd of elders and disciples to erupt.\u201cWhat!? A fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?\u201d\u201cHeavens! This time our Qin Clan has actually produced a top-rated genius!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe complexions of the present crowd were filled with great shock, they felt that this result was inconceivable.It had to be known that if a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was placed within Linshui City, it would still be a top-rated genius which only appeared once every three years. Moreover, the achievement of those who had fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirits or above would be limitless and of great importance.They originally thought that Qin Changkong could only awaken a fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.Qin Changkong\u2019s face revealed a delighted expression, he also did not anticipate that he would unexpectedly awaken a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.Upon seeing the astonished gazes of the elders and disciples, Qin Changkong couldn\u2019t help but give birth to great arrogance within his heart. His gaze swept across the room before landing on a disciple with a plain appearance. Qin Changkong\u2019s eyes were filled with provocation. \\nThis disciple was the current Young Lord of the Qin Clan, Qin Clan\u2019s number one genius, Qin Nan.\u201cAlright, next! Qin Nan!\u201d The elder in charge of the ceremony quickly reacted and immediately shouted. A trace of expectation rose within his eyes.Now that a first-rate genius like Qin Changkong had appeared, then based on Qin Nan\u2019s innate talent, his awakened Martial Spirit naturally wouldn\u2019t be any worse than Qin Changkong.In that case, possessing two first-rate geniuses would cause the future of the Qin Clan to be no small matter.Accordingly, after the elder in charge had called out this name, the currently astonished disciples and elders all turned their gazes towards the average looking youth in unison with high expectation within their eyes, so much that it even exceeded their expectations for Qin Changkong.Qin Nan. Not only was he a legend within the Qin Clan, but he was also one in Linshui City.Qin Nan was the son of the head of the Qin Clan. At a young age, he had learned how to read and write by the age of 6; and by 8, the fame of his calligraphy had reached Linshui City. He then abandoned literature for Martial Arts at the age of 9, practiced Fist Art by the age of 10, and by the time he was 11; he was able to bare-handedly hunt tigers. He practiced saber arts at the age of 12, mastered ten different Martial Skills at 13, and was struck by lightning at 14. This caused his entire body to become wounded. By the age of 16, he was able to create a Saber Skill which was classified as a middle-grade Martial Skill, causing a huge shockwave throughout Linshui City.Previously, an expert whose cultivation had reached \u201cMartial Emperor\u201d, had heard about Qin Nan\u2019s accomplishments, and stated, \u201cThis disciple\u2019s innate talent is no small matter; his awakened Martial Spirit will definitely be of fifth-grade Huang rank or even higher! His future accomplishments definitely won\u2019t be normal.\u201d \\nThat single sentence from the Martial Emperor had a great effect. Qin Nan hadn\u2019t even awakened his Martial Spirit but was already granted the title of Linshui City\u2019s number one genius.Qin Nan wore a pitch black gown, and along with his slightly pale skin, it seemed as if he had just recovered from a serious illness. Under the crowd\u2019s attentive gaze, his complexion seemed extremely tranquil; he had no arrogance or impatience as he walked towards the altar.\u201cHu! This day has finally arrived\u2026..\u201dQin Nan thought to himself as he took a deep breath and ignored the gazes of the crowd, he then sat down cross-legged before tightly closing his eyes.Immediately, threads of white rays floated from the bottom of the altar, incessantly boring into Qin Nan\u2019s body.At the same time, after the surrounding disciples and elders saw Qin Nan enter this state, they began to seethe with excitement.\u201cI have a feeling that Young Lord Qin Nan\u2019s awakened Martial Spirit will not be a simple matter!\u201d\u201cYeah! Young Lord Qin Nan\u2019s innate talent is higher than Young Master Qin Changkong who had awakened a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, therefore it\u2019s certain that his Martial Spirit will also be even greater!\u201d\u201cSomeone surpassing a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? Since the beginning of the Qin Clan, there hasn\u2019t even been a single one!\u201d\u201cShut up! Don\u2019t disturb Young Lord Qin Nan! If something were to happen, would you be able to take responsibility?\u201dThe atmosphere was incomparably passionate. Other than the generations of youth revering, there were even some elders who were praising without cease, their heart was filled with great expectations.However, as Qin Changkong witnessed this scene, his former happiness and arrogance from awakening a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit instantly disappeared, his complexion turned extremely ugly. \\n\u201cHumph! Our Martial Spirits are decided by the heavens, everything else doesn\u2019t count.\u201d Qin Changkong commented coldly, \u201cAre you guys seriously thinking that a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit is worth nothing? Do you think you have the ability to awaken it? It\u2019s possible that when the time comes, Young Lord Qin Nan\u2019s awakened Spirit might only be of a second-grade Huang rank!\u201dFollowing his words, the gazes of the surrounding disciples and elders carried despise as they looked at him.However, these disciples and elders did not retort, after all, the current Qin Changkong possessed an innate talent of a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit; his status was of great importance.Qin Changkong was being frowned upon by everyone. Although he was in a bad mood, his heart felt increasingly calm. Qin Nan\u2019s innate talent had been on display ever since he was a child, it even caused the Martial Emperor to be astonished. Hence, his awakened Martial Spirit couldn\u2019t possibly be of a mere third-grade Huang rank.As he thought about this, Qin Changkong gazed firmly at the altar.\u201cQin Nan, you better awaken a Martial Spirit which is lower than fifth-grade Huang rank, or at least one that doesn\u2019t surpass a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2026.\u201dQin Changkong couldn\u2019t help but curse Qin Nan.At this moment, the fluttering lights which were emitted from the altar began to shine brighter and brighter.As he sat on the altar cross-legged and basked under the white rays, Qin Nan\u2019s face slightly turned red. From within his slightly weak and thin body, a sharp and dreadful roar of a beast resounded.The whole crowd practically stopped breathing at the same time as they heard this roar.A \u201cBoom\u201d sound echoed forth and a yellow light abruptly ascended from within Qin Nan\u2019s body. Under the gaze of the nervous crowd, the ascending yellow light unexpectedly came to a stop, followed by a great saber wreathed in flames which gradually floated out from within the yellow light. \\nIn just an instant, the disciples and elders immediately turned stagnant.One yellow ray? First-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? The lowest type of Martial Spirit? How could this be possible?Even Qin Changkong who had just been incessantly cursing Qin Nan was stunned, his face filled with astonishment. Qin Changkong didn\u2019t expect that Linshui City\u2019s number one genius, Qin Nan, was only able to awaken a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, the poorest type of Martial Spirit!As he sat atop the altar cross-legged, Qin Nan slowly opened his eyes and was met with the idle expressions of the crowd.\u201cScarlet Flame Saber, first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2026..\u201dQin Nan read the sentence within his heart before his mind jolted and he retracted the floating Scarlet Flame Saber into his body. He did not show sorrow nor despair, instead, the corner of his eyes glimmered with concealed delightfulness.Translator: TofuEditor: Mantou (Special thanks to Zihan for proofreading)\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - Divine Battle SpiritPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2 \u2013 Divine Battle SpiritThe crowd went quiet for a period of time.Qin Changkong was the first to react, he couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing, \u201cHahaha! Qin Nan! Who would\u2019ve thought that you would unexpectedly awaken a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit! Genius my ass! Now you\u2019re thoroughly a waste. Whereas I am now the true genius of the Qin Clan, as well as Linshui City\u2019s number one genius!\u201dFirst-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, this would be equivalent to the lowest existence out of all the Martial Spirits! One could also call it the \u2018Martial Spirit Waste\u2019.Even within the Qin Clan, those who awakened a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit were very few in numbers. The majority had awakened a second-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.Qin Changkong\u2019s frenzied and ear-piercing laughter immediately awoke the crowd.The expressions of the elders and disciples toward Qin Nan immediately changed from one of revere and expectation into one of severe disappointment and despise.\u201cIt\u2019s unexpectedly a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit! Oh my lord! That\u2019s so trash.\u201d\u201cF*** me! What a waste of my emotions. What bullshit number \u2018one genius\u2019, he\u2019s only a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit Waste.\u201d\u201cYeah! Big Brother Qin Changkong is the true number one genius. This Qin Nan, I\u2019m afraid he is Qin Clan\u2019s number one waste!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the Martial World, the strong had authority, thus, the reaction of the crowd was not strange at all. Instead, they harbored an indescribable hostility towards Qin Nan.This was due to the fact that ever since Qin Nan was young, he had displayed an incredibly formidable innate talent. This caused them to also have very high expectations of him. However, who would have thought that this would be the final result.How could these elders and disciples not despise Qin Nan after wasting everyone\u2019s feelings? \\nQin Changkong was extremely excited and high-spirited, he wore a domineering expression as he laughed at Qin Nan, \u201cDid you see that? I have told you once before, the Martial Spirits are decided by the heavens. Even if you created a Martial Skill, so what? At the end of the day, you\u2019re just a waste!\u201dQin Nan glanced at him indifferently. Without saying a word, he proceeded to leave with large strides.If it was like the past, there would definitely be disciples of Qin Clan as well as elders following him. However, currently, there was not a single person beside Qin Nan, the scene seemed particularly lonely.As Qin Nan walked away, the surrounding disciples and Elders immediately reacted by surrounding Qin Changkong. Their faces were filled with the intentions of currying favors.\u201cWow! Big Brother Qin Changkong, recently, you haven\u2019t paid attention to us at all, we\u2019ve really missed you.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Qin Changkong, it would make more sense if you were the Young Lord of the Qin Clan. What kind of qualifications does that waste have to possess that title?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Qin Changkong, from now on, I will be your subordinate. If you tell me to go east, then I\u2019ll definitely not walk west!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNot long after the end of the Martial Spirit Awakening Ceremony, the incident had spread throughout Qin Clan and Linshui City. Not only was the people of Qin Clan extremely startled, but even the people of Linshui city were thoroughly dumbfounded.They couldn\u2019t believe that Linshui City\u2019s number one genius, Qin Nan, had actually awakened a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.However, this was the Martial World. Albeit astonished and dumbstruck, their gaze quickly turned to watch over Qin Changkong.After all, he has a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. Within Linshui City, he was a top-rate existence. \\nAfter Qin Nan left the stage, he directly returned to his courtyard. His expression was tranquil from the beginning until present, not even a slightest bit of rage appeared on his face. That is how it works in this world. Only when you have strength will people revere you.Although he understood this logic, the reactions of the disciples and elders of the Qin Clan still caused Qin Nan to feel slightly disappointed.\u201cWhatever, there\u2019s no need to be bothered with them. I\u2019ll begin with using this Martial Spirit and experience the taste of cultivation.\u201dQin Nan quickly recovered his tranquillity as he sat cross-legged in the large courtyard. The Scarlet Flame Saber emerged from his back, it rose slowly as it emitted traces of heat.The Scarlet Flame Saber floated as it issued a profound attraction force, drawing in the Spiritual Qi from the Heaven and Earth.As the Spiritual Qi entered Qin Nan\u2019s body, he couldn\u2019t help but become slightly startled. His somewhat pale complexion began to redden as if he had gotten drunk from drinking wine.Cultivation as a whole started out in the realm of tempering the body and was split into ten different layers.The so-called \u201cBody Tempering\u201d was just as the name implied. It was when you absorb the Spiritual Qi into your body and temper it.As a result, after Qin Nan had absorbed the Spiritual Qi into his body, he had already begun marrow and Meridian cleansing as well as physical body strengthening.As the time slowly passed, Qin Nan finally opened his eyes after three or more hours had passed. On his forehead were rows of fine sweat.\u201cThe grade of the Martial Spirit is indeed very important\u2026\u201d Qin Nan thought to himself.He clenched the Scarlet Flame Saber in his hands as he meticulously inspected the saber. The corners of his mouth couldn\u2019t help but reveal a hint of bitterness. \\nAfter experiencing cultivation, he finally understood why the grades of Martial Spirits were so important.For example, he had been cultivating for six hours but he gained nothing out of it. However, if Qin Changkong were to cultivate for six hours, I\u2019m afraid he would have already broken through the first-layer of Body Tempering.Furthermore, the higher grade your Martial Spirit is, the greater amount of assistance it can provide during a fight.\u201cHowever, thankfully I awakened a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. If it was some other grade, then I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d be quite gloomy\u2026.\u201dThe corner of Qin Nan\u2019s mouth curled into an indifferent smile. With a thought, he entered and immersed himself within his Dantian.Within Qin Nan\u2019s Dantian was a floating crimson thunderbolt around the size of a knuckle, drifting up and down. The thunderbolt also emanated a mysterious and dreadful ancient aura.This was Qin Nan\u2019s greatest secret, even his father didn\u2019t know about this.During his training session when he was fourteen years old, he had encountered an abrupt change in weather which caused a rainfall. As he rushed to find a place to shelter himself from the rain, Qin Nan was unluckily struck by a crimson thunderbolt.The matter of him being struck by a heavenly thunder had actually been known by every single citizen of Linshui City. However, the fact that they had not known was that following the incident where Qin Nan had been struck by the thunderbolt, new memories had emerged within his mind, while a crimson thunderbolt emerged within his body.\u201cAccording to the shattered fragment of the memory, this crimson thunderbolt was an ownerless Martial Spirit known as the Divine Battle Spirit. \u201c\u201cIf one wanted to obtain this Divine Battle Spirit, then they would have to tribute their own Martial Spirit to obtain it.\u201d \\n\u201cMoreover, the higher the grade of your Martial Spirit, then the lower the chances of awakening the Divine Battle Spirit. However, if your Martial Spirit was at first-grade Huang rank, then you could definitely awaken the Divine Battle Spirit.The smile on the corners of Qin Nan\u2019s mouth stretched wider and wider, this was the reason as to why he had not been depressed over awakening a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.After all, the origins of the Divine Battle Spirit was mysterious. If he had awakened a fifth-grade Martial Spirit and used it as an offering, then he wouldn\u2019t have been able to guarantee its odds of success.One would need to be quite optimistic to use a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit as a tribute.However, as Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit was currently a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, as well as his status of being a waste, there was practically no difference. If he were to tribute in his current state, although he could not guarantee the odds of success, he also wouldn\u2019t be under any pressure.The smile on Qin Nan\u2019s face quickly vanished as he held the Scarlet Flame Saber in his hands. He inhaled a deep breath and said, \u201cNow, I\u2019ll be using this saber as a tribute\u2026.\u201dQin Nan\u2019s face immediately turned grim as he began to chant verses of an ancient incantation.This incantation was called \u2018Spirit Sacrifice Technique\u2019. This technique had emerged within his mind when he was struck by the thunderbolt.Spirit Sacrifice Technique, just as the name implied, was a technique which allowed one to sacrifice their own Martial Spirit. This technique was extremely peculiar, it didn\u2019t require the expenditure of Spiritual Qi or any other costs. It was incomparably mysterious.Following the activation of Spirit Sacrifice Technique, a few black lights emerged from Qin Nan\u2019s hands. Following this, the black lights became viscous, it was like liquid, incessantly extruding. \\nQin Nan\u2019s face became solemn as he immediately raised his palm toward the Scarlet Flame Saber in front of him and firmly grasped it.A stunning scene could be seen, the entire Scarlet Flame Saber begun to buzz and quiver. It was like an incorporeal destructive power blew up within the Scarlet Flame Saber\u2019s body, causing it to instantly explode.After the Scarlet Flame Saber had exploded, it filled the skies with red-colored dots. It was as though it had blossomed into small wisps of flames.Qin Nan\u2019s complexion immediately paled. During the instant the Scarlet Flame Saber had exploded, he felt as if his soul was pulled out, causing him to almost suffocate.After all, although Martial Spirits were granted to him by the heavens, it was also a part of him. When his Martial Spirit shattered, it was equivalent to Qin Nan\u2019s body shattering.Qin Nan grit his teeth and endured the pressure emanating from his brain. He extended a palm toward the sky and clasped his hands, a mysterious attraction force immediately erupted from the black liquid within his palms.The scattered red-colored dots in the air was immediately absorbed into Qin Nan\u2019s body as it poured into his Dantian.The Crimson Thunderbolt within his Dantian absorbed the entirety of the red dots. In this instant, it was as if the time had frozen, followed by an abrupt explosion from the Crimson Thunderbolt.\u201cThe Divine Battle Spirit wages war against the heavens and battle against earth. Whether they be Gods or Buddhas, there is none He does not fight and none He does not win against.\u201dThe imposing ancient voice felt like countless of thunderbolts simultaneously surging through Qin Nan\u2019s mind.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dQin Nan widened his bloodshot eyes, he was unable to utter a single sound of pain. Soon after, he was quaked unconscious due to the enormous shock.\\n\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, as he tried to sit up, he couldn\u2019t help but gasp. Presently, his brain was still aching, it felt as if any wanton movement would cause his head to break.\u201cThat ancient voice was terrifying.\u201dQin Nan\u2019s complexion paled. The ancient voice he had heard yesterday felt as though it had entered his soul. As he recalled it, he felt a recurring fear.\u201cMy current priority is to inspect the Divine Battle Spirit\u2026\u201dQin Nan swiftly walked to the large courtyard before he sat down cross-legged. His face revealed slight nervousness; although the origin of the Divine Battle Spirit was mysterious, Qin Nan wasn\u2019t sure of what grade Martial Soul it was.Qin Nan inhaled a deep breath and then slowly closed his eyes. His mental state entered his body as he begun to channel his Martial Soul.In front of Qin Nan, golden rays radiated one after another. When it reached six golden rays, it finally stopped.An indistinct and transparent human-like avatar rose from within the golden rays. As the silhouette floated in mid air, it was as if a Supreme King had descended, it emitted a powerful force which could cause people\u2019s hearts to flutter.Qin Nan\u2019s complexion turned blank as he gazed at the scene, \u201cThis is\u2026 the Divine Battle Spirit?\u201dSoon after, Qin Nan\u2019s face revealed a happy expression.The Divine Battle Spirit definitely did not let him down, it had reached sixth-grade Huang ranked stage! Although it was much less compared to Qin Nan\u2019s initial expectations, the boundless, ancient and profound aura emitted from the Divine Battle Spirit gave people a premonition that it was far more superior than it seemed.\u201cHu\u2026.I don\u2019t know what kind of capabilities the Divine Battle Spirit has, but let\u2019s start with cultivation.\u201d Qin Nan suppressed the joy and swiftly calmed his heart before channeling the Divine Battle Spirit. \\nIn an instant, a shocking scene appeared. The Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s Avatar, emanated a frightening yet mysterious aura as it abruptly sat down cross-legged.The surrounding Spiritual Qi of the Heaven and Earth begun to flood toward Qin Nan and unexpectedly condensed an indistinct white fog around his body.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Nan was caught by surprise, the speed of his cultivation was much faster compared to the first-grade Huang ranked Scarlet Flame Saber. The speed had increased by more than tenfold!A sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was indeed of no small matter.Qin Nan quickly immersed himself within his cultivation. He channeled the Divine Battle Spirit and entered an ethereal state, incessantly absorbing the Spiritual Qi of the Heaven and Earth.Spiritual Qi of the Heaven and Earth entered Qin Nan\u2019s body, continuously circulated within his body while giving off a crashing sound similar to the sound of flowing water.The time slowly elapsed. After six hours had passed, Qin Nan opened his eyes as his body emitted a crackling sound similar to the sound created when frying beans.(TL note: Sizzling sounds)Within these six hours, his cultivation had unexpectedly broken through to first-layer of the Body Tempering realm!\u201cWith the Divine Battle Spirit, my dream of becoming an Expert will no longer be just words.\u201d Qin Nan clenched his fist, his flickering eyes was filled with resolution.The Canglan Continent was boundless, not only was there Linshui City, but there was also the Luo River Kingdom. They were all just drops within the vast ocean.Qin Nan became the number one genius within Linshui City when he was a youth, so naturally, he had high aspirations. He wanted to reach a stage where he was able to carry a saber on his back and hold a bottle of wine in his hands as he freely roamed the continents. Swiftly settling gratitudes and grievances, while being natural and unrestricted. \\nAt this moment, a voice could be heard from the other end of the door, \u201cYoung Lord, this month\u2019s supplies have arrived.\u201dFollowing these words, a maid came in with a tray in her hands. Atop of the tray was a jade bottle which emitted thick Spiritual Qi.Qin Nan was slightly startled before he promptly recalled that today was the day when the Qin Clan distributed resources for cultivation.As one of the two major families within Linshui City, it was only natural for the Qin Clan to place great importance on Martial Art. Hence, every month on this day, the Qin Clan would distribute resources for cultivation to the disciples of the Clan.After Qin Nan received the bottle and had the maid leave, he opened it and was once again, slightly startled.Within the jade bottle laid ten sparkling and translucent dark green pills. Thick Spiritual Qi permeated around the pills.Qin Nan naturally recognized these medicine pills; they were Body Tempering Pills. These pills were specifically used to temper the body during cultivation.However, Body Tempering Pills are exceptionally precious. An ordinary disciple of the Qin Clan could only receive a single pill to temper their body during cultivation. However, Qin Nan possessed as many as ten pills.\u201cFather\u2026.\u201d Qin Nan felt slightly emotional. The fact that he had awakened a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit had most likely been spread throughout Linshui City. From a genius to an infamous waste.Normally, the Elders of Qin Clan definitely would not give a waste such as Qin Nan this many pills. Thus, the only explanation for these pills would be that Qin Nan\u2019s father had sent them over.Qin Nan\u2019s father, Qin Tian was the Patriarch of the Qin Clan. Naturally, nobody would dare to stop him if he wanted to give Qin Nan ten Body Tempering Pills.\\nFurthermore, Qin Tian had known that Qin Nan had become a waste, he still sent ten Body Tempering Pills. From this, one could tell that within Qin Tian\u2019s heart, Qin Nan was still his most beloved son.\u201cFather, your son, Qin Nan, definitely won\u2019t let you down\u2026.. Now, I\u2019ll use the pills you have given me to break through the second-layer of Body Tempering realm in a single go.\u201dQin Nan picked up a Body Tempering Pill and swallowed it. He then immediately sat down cross-legged to begin refining the pill.However, at this moment, a strange scene occurred. After the body tempering pill flowed into his body, it was not digested. Instead, a mysterious attraction came from within Qin Nan\u2019s body, resulting in the Qi from the Body Tempering Pill to be completely absorbed.Qin Nan\u2019s expression turned blank, \u201cWhat\u2026.What\u2019s this?\u201dHe immediately picked up two more Body Tempering Pills and promptly swallowed it. However, the same event occurred, the Spiritual Qi was once again completely absorbed by an incorporeal attraction.\u201cThis\u2026 Is this the Divine Battle Spirit?\u201dQin Nan pondered for a long period of time before finally arriving at an answer. Following this, he immediately released the Divine Battle Spirit.After releasing the Divine Battle Spirit, Qin Nan picked up yet another three Body Tempering Pills and swallowed it. Just as he had expected, the Divine Battle Spirit emanated a mysterious attraction, completely absorbing the Qi from the Body Tempering Pills.\u201cThe Divine Battle Spirit can actually absorb the Spiritual Qi of the pills?\u201d Qin Nan was shocked. He had never imagined that Martial Spirits could actually absorb Elixir.\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll just let him absorb the Elixirs and observe what will happen after!\u201dQin Nan clenched his teeth, either way, the cultivation speed of Divine Battle Spirit wasn\u2019t lacking, thus, he wasn\u2019t in need of Elixirs. He then retrieved the remaining Body Tempering Pills before swallowing them. \\nAfter he had swallowed the remainder of the pills, he began to tremble.From the Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s Avatar came a sudden blossoming of a seventh yellow ray. The pressure which the Divine Battle Spirit emitted became increasingly fearsome.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201dQin Nan\u2019s complexion revealed a stunned expression. Seven yellow rays, this represented seventh-grade Huang rank. The grade of this Divine Battle Spirit had actually increased by one whole level!\u201cThis meant\u2026. that the Divine Battle Spirit could devour Elixirs to ascend a grade!\u201dQin Nan\u2019s current feelings could no longer be described as being just astonished. The formidability of the Divine Battle Spirit had already exceeded his imaginations!Martial Spirits were granted by the heavens, once you\u2019ve awakened your Martial Spirit, it would accompany you for the rest of your life. Qin Nan had never heard of a case such as this before.In this case, if there are enough Elixirs, then wouldn\u2019t the Divine Battle Spirit be able to reach up to Xuan-rank? Di-rank? Or even the Tian-rank from the legends?Tian-ranked Martial Spirit, how fearsome was that? Qin Nan was unable to imagine it.\u201cHu\u2026 Calm down, I have to remain calm.\u201d Qin Nan inhaled a series of deep breaths and suppressed the raging emotions within his heart, forcing himself to calm down.His expression concealed his excitement similar to before.In the beginning when he had awakened the Divine Battle Spirit, although it was a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, Qin Nan still thought it was far from what it actually was. He believed it was much stronger than just sixth-grade Huang rank.Presently, the Divine Battle Spirit had actually increased a grade. Just based on this fact, perhaps it was even stronger than a Xuan-rank or even a legendary Di-rank Martial Spirit. Its potential is limitless and definitely was of no small matter.\\nHowever, just as Qin Nan was beginning to feel excited, a \u201cPeng\u201d sound echoed from the gate of Qin Nan\u2019s courtyard, causing it to shatter into numerous fragments.An incomparably aggressive voice resounded, \u201cQin Nan! Quickly get out of here or else don\u2019t blame me for disregarding our former relationship!\u201dA crowd of people dressed in a gorgeous robe stormed in; their faces were filled with pride. Hovering behind the crowd was a five Chi long cyan sword, it radiated three yellow rays which gave off a cold and sharp feeling.As he gazed at the crowd, Qin Nan\u2019s complexion instantly turned cold, \u201cQin Xiao, what do you want?\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Martial Skill PavilionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4 \u2013 Martial Skill PavilionQin Xiao had not only known Qin Nan but was also extremely familiar with him.In the past, Qin Nan was the Qin Clan\u2019s number one genius, hence Qin Xiao used to respectfully fawn over Qin Nan. At that time, Qin Nan\u2019s impression of Qin Xiao wasn\u2019t bad at all, he even regarded him as a brother!However, Qin Nan had never thought there would be a day where Qin Xiao would actually shatter his door and spit out threats.At present, Qin Nan had already known why. His status as a waste caused the relationship between him and Qin Xiao to turn hostile.Qin Xiao raised his head in extreme arrogance, \u201cMy objective for today\u2019s visit is simple. Hand over your Body Tempering Pills. Don\u2019t try to lie to me, I\u2019ve already known that you received ten Body Tempering Pills.\u201dFollowing his words, he came to a stop before revealing a hint of disdain, \u201cQin Nan, don\u2019t blame this brother for being merciless, you are currently a waste. The Body Tempering Pills are completely useless on you, you might as well give it to me.\u201dAnger filled Qin Nan as he burst into laughter, \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t give it to you?\u201dAs Qin Xiao heard this reply, his arrogant expression changed into a cold one, \u201cQin Nan, if you don\u2019t hand it over today, then don\u2019t blame me for being impolite! Even though I have yet to begin cultivating, my Martial Spirit is still of third-grade Huang ranked!\u201dThe long sword hovering behind him suddenly flew out, the sword aura flickered with an imposing chill.\u201cQin Xiao, it seems like you are planning on severing our relationship.\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s complexion was tranquil. Despite the flying long sword, he was not even slightly fearful! \u201cThe Body Tempering Pills have already been used by me, you may leave now,\u201d said Qin Nan in an indifferent manner.\\nFollowing his words, Qin Nan sighed furtively as he closed his eyes.Qin Nan naturally felt angry as he saw Qin Xiao\u2019s conceited manner. If this had happened in the past, then Qin Nan would have already made his move, however, Qin Nan thought about his former relations with Qin Xiao and ultimately decided not to attack.Qin Xiao\u2019s complexion changed as a murderous aura surged from his body, \u201cQin Nan, I\u2019m giving you face but you don\u2019t accept it. Today, I\u2019ll let you know the disparity between a third-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit!\u201dAs he spoke, the long sword behind Qin Xiao emanated a buzzing sound. It glimmered with a cold light as it fiercely chopped towards Qin Nan.Originally, Qin Xiao didn\u2019t want to make his move. This wasn\u2019t due to their former relationship, but it was due to the fact that Qin Nan was the Young Lord of the Qin Clan. His background caused Qin Xiao to feel quite apprehensive.However, Qin Xiao had never imagined that, even though Qin Nan had become trash, he unexpectedly dare to make it problematic for him. Qin Nan was simply too reckless.\u201cQin Nan, this is your own fault!\u201d Qin Xiao\u2019s face revealed a sardonic smile. He was able to envision the appearance of the former aloof and solitary number one genius, Qin Nan, suffering and moaning as he begged him to spare his life.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dQin Nan could no longer bear it anymore, the anger within his heart erupted as he roared. His roar was akin to thunder.He strode over in an imposing manner with his clenched hammer-like fist and ruthlessly plummeted the long sword as the strength of the first-layer Body Tempering realm erupted.Low-class Martial Skill, Collapsing Fist! \\nWithin this instant, the sardonic smile on Qin Xiao\u2019s face immediately abruptly froze. He was dumbstruck.Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation had actually reached the first-layer of Body Tempering realm?An ear-piercing explosion resounded as he was in thought. The long sword was unable to resist Qin Nan\u2019s fist and was sent flying. The long sword quivered with a buzzing sound as the sword\u2019s aura had turned incomparably bleak.\u201cAgh\u2026..\u201d A miserable shriek immediately echoed from Qin Xiao. His Martial Spirit had received a severe impact, hence it was only natural that Qin Xiao\u2019s body also suffered an injury.Qin Nan\u2019s face was cold and detached as he gazed at the scene, \u201cTell me, who\u2019s the waste?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026. you\u2026. you\u2026\u201d Qin Xiao clutched his chest, his complexion was incomparably pale. He gazed into Qin Nan\u2019s eyes once again, but there was no longer arrogance, instead, there was fear and astonishment. \u201cHow were you able to break through to the first-layer of Body Tempering realm? You only have a first-grade Huang ranked waste whereas I have a third-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. I haven\u2019t even broken through! Yet, how have you?!\u201dQin Xiao was simply unable to accept the truth which was laid before his eyes.He had awakened a third-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and had been bitterly cultivating for the past few days. He had even used a Body Tempering Pill, yet he still hadn\u2019t broken through.How could Qin Nan have broken through?\u201cI\u2019ve already said this before, the Body Tempering Pills have already been used by me.\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s gaze swept past Qin Xiao with indifference, \u201cGet lost!\u201dThese two words were like a pardon. Qin Xiao frantically tried to leave the courtyard without caring about the pain on his body, he didn\u2019t dare look back.He originally thought he could finally bully Qin Nan by relying on his third-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, but he had never thought that Qin Nan had already broken through.\\nQin Xiao didn\u2019t dare to imagine what else Qin Nan would do to him if he stayed behind.The large courtyard finally became peaceful and quiet after Qin Xiao had left. Qin Nan stood in his original position for a while before he sighed furtively. Soon after, he quickly returned to his completely tranquil state.As far as Qin Nan was concerned, if someone showed respect to him, then he would likewise show respect to this person. Towards people like Qin Xiao, a person who bites the hands of those who fed him, a person who relied on their strength to bully others, Qin Nan could only feel regret. He no longer regarded him as a brother.If he were to meet Qin Xiao again in the future and he hadn\u2019t repented, then Qin Nan would not show mercy.\u201cIt seems like I won\u2019t be able to cultivate anymore for today.\u201d Qin Nan glanced at the shattered door of the courtyard and forced a bitter smile as he shook his head. He did not want others seeing him release the Divine Battle Spirit.Qin Nan did not want to reveal the secret of the Divine Battle Spirit at this moment.\u201cSince I can\u2019t cultivate anymore, then I might as well go to the Martial Skill Pavilion. This time, I am able to enter the second floor!\u201dQin Nan\u2019s eyes glimmered with excitement.Ever since he was young, he had always had a special interest in Martial Skills. This was the main reason as to why he had mastered ten different Martial Skills at the age of thirteen and created a Sword Technique at sixteen.The Collapsing Fist that he had used today was one of the Martial Skills he learned when he was thirteen years old.In the past, Qin Nan had yet to awaken his Martial Spirit which was why he was only able to enter the first floor of the Martial Skill Pavilion and could only study low-class Martial Skills, he was simply unable to cultivate higher Martial skills. Now that he had awakened his Martial Spirit and his cultivation had achieved the first-layer of the Body Tempering realm, he naturally had the qualifications to enter the second floor. \\nAs Qin Nan pondered, he could no longer stay put and swiftly walked towards the Martial Skill Pavilion.The Martial Skill Pavilion was classified as a forbidden area within the Qin Clan. Not only were you not allowed to cause trouble within the Pavilion, you were also not allowed to use Martial Arts when inside. If one were to break the rules, then they would forever lose the qualifications to enter the Pavilion.The Martial Skill Pavilion of the Qin Clan had four floors, the first floor stored the low-class Martial Skills. The second floor stored the middle-class Martial Skills whereas the third floor stored the high-class Martial Skills. It\u2019s told that the fourth floor stored Supreme-class Martial Skills, it was the treasure of the Qin Clan. Even Qin Changkong, who was the number one genius of the Clan, was not qualified to enter.However, whether this rumor was true or not remained unknown.When Qin Nan arrived at the Martial Skill Pavilion, there were not a single shadow to be seen in the surrounding area. The former lively place filled with noise and excitement turned completely desolate.However, this was well within Qin Nan\u2019s expectations. After all, the second floor of the Martial Skill Pavilion was only available for those who have reached the first-layer of the Body Tempering Realm.Only a short period of time had passed since the disciples of the Qin Clan had awakened their Martial Spirits. Those who broke through to the first-layer of Body Tempering realm within these few days were very few in number.As Qin Nan approached, the old man with gray hair sitting within the Martial Skill Pavilion was startled before asking, \u201cQin Nan, why have you come??\u201dQin Nan naturally knew of this gray-haired old man, they even had a good relationship. He immediately cupped his hands and replied, \u201cElder Ying, the purpose of this little one\u2019s visit today is to enter the second floor of the Martial Skill Pavilion.\u201d\\n\u201cThe second floor of the Martial Skill Pavilion?\u201d Elder Ying was startled before coldness gradually filled his face, \u201cQin Nan, just because we have a good relationship doesn\u2019t mean I will allow you to enter the second floor. If you want to enter the second floor, then your cultivation would have to reach the first-layer of the Body Tempering Realm!\u201dAfter he had spoken, Elder Ying thought about the matter of Qin Nan becoming a waste from a genius and promptly spoke earnestly with good intentions, \u201cQin Nan, although you\u2019ve only awakened a first-grade Martial Spirit, you shouldn\u2019t despair. As long as you put in effort\u2026\u201dAs Qin Nan heard this, he wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry. He immediately walked towards Elder Ying, his palm grabbed onto the table and a dent in the form of five fingers appeared on the surface.\u201cYou\u2026..\u201d Elder Ying was startled once again, he asked in an astonished manner, \u201cYour cultivation has broken through to the first-layer of Body Tempering realm?\u201dQin Nan didn\u2019t respond to Elder Ying, instead, he only revealed a smile before turning around and entering the Martial Skill Pavilion. Left behind was Elder Ying who was filled with astonishment for a long period of time.As Qin Nan passed through the first floor of the Martial Skill Pavilion and entered the second floor, his eyes shone slightly.Standing erected on the second floor of the Martial Skill Pavilion were eight big mahogany pillars supporting the floor. There were also a few white jade tables, and on top of these tables laid a few ancient books.Qin Nan promptly walked over and just as he was about to pick up a book, an abrupt voice full of shock sounded, \u201cQin Nan?\u201dQin Nan subconsciously turned his head around and noticed a youth wearing a white long gown inlaid with gold standing not too far away. His face was filled with astonishment as he gazed at Qin Nan. \\nSeeing this youth, Qin Nan was slightly startled, followed by an indifferent voice saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that you would also be here.\u201dQin Nan was also very familiar with the youth in front of him. His name is Qin Yu, and he was Qin Xiao\u2019s elder brother. He had also awakened a fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, hence he was classified as a genius-class existence within the Qin Clan.However, the fact that caused Qin Nan to become speechless was the fact that he didn\u2019t imagine that after he beat up the little brother, he would encounter the older brother.When Qin Yu noticed Qin Nan, his face revealed a hint of ridicule as he remarked, \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought that your insignificant first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, this kind of trash, was unexpectedly able to reach the first-layer of the Body Tempering Realm. It seems like the effects of the ten Body Tempering Pills given to you by the Patriarch was not bad at all.\u201dAs he mentioned the ten Body Tempering Pills, Qin Yu\u2019s heart turned sour. Although he had awakened a fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, he only received three Body Tempering Pills a month, it was not even half of what Qin Nan received.As a result, Qin Yu couldn\u2019t help but mock Qin Nan when he noticed him.Qin Nan looked at him indifferently before replying, \u201cThe effects were indeed not bad at all. Not too long ago, I beat your little brother using the strength of a first-layer Body Tempering Realm.\u201dAs Qin Nan spoke, Qin Yu\u2019s complexion turned stiff.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Thundercrash Saber ArtPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5 \u2013 Thundercrash Saber ArtOriginally, Qin Nan didn\u2019t hold a grudge towards Qin Yu, however, he hadn\u2019t imagined that Qin Yu would mock and ridicule him. Thus, he naturally didn\u2019t care about the feelings of the other party.\u201cYou attacked my younger brother?\u201d Qin Yu questioned with an ominous gaze.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Qin Nan replied indifferently, \u201cNot only did your younger brother completely disregard our former relationship, he also destroyed my court gate and humiliated me. He assaulted me and attempted to take my Elixir. Hence, I gave him a light beating.\u201d\u201cGave him a light beating?\u201d Qin Yu was enraged, \u201cQin Nan, so what if my little brother stole your Elixir? If a good-for-nothing like you uses these Elixirs, it would just be a waste of our resources!Qin Nan\u2019s expression turned cold, he had never thought that Qin Yu would speak so shamelessly.Due to the fact that the other party had not shown any signs of respect, Qin Nan also became increasingly impolite, \u201cAdmittedly, you and your brother both have the same morality and conduct, both of you are shameless and immoral. You sicken me.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say!?\u201dQin Yu erupted, he had never thought that this waste would dare be so arrogant. Qin Yu immediately bellowed, \u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dAs the words left his mouth, Qin Yu took large strides and the Qi of a first-layer Body Tempering Realm erupted. He channeled his Martial Spirit and yellow rays began to flicker from his back as he struck towards Qin Nan with explosive force.At this moment, Elder Ying\u2019s austere voice resounded throughout the second floor, \u201cThe Martial Skill Pavilion prohibits battles. Qin Yu, if you are to break the rules today, then you will be forever barred from treading upon the Martial Skill Pavilion by even half a step!\u201d\\nElder Ying\u2019s words caused Qin Yu to feel as though cold water had been poured down his head.\u201cElder Ying, I apologize. This disciple definitely will not violate the rules of the Martial Skill Pavilion,\u201d Qin Yu said loudly as he suppressed his anger.He knew Elder Ying wasn\u2019t joking. Even if he was the number one genius of the Qin Clan but had violated the rules, he would still suffer a form of punishment. It would a waste if he were to be forever barred from entry into the Martial Skill Pavilion.Following his apology, Qin Yu turned around and glared fiercely at Qin Nan before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky today. Don\u2019t let me see you again or else I\u2019ll break all four of your limbs, destroy your Dantian, and turn you into a waste amongst the waste!\u201d\u201cOh really?\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s face didn\u2019t show the slightest hint of fear, instead, he coldly retorted, \u201cThen I\u2019ll repeat the same words, you better not run into me. Moreover, at that time, you better not kneel before me. I definitely won\u2019t forgive someone as shameless and immoral as you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.you\u2026..\u201dQin Yu\u2019s entire body trembled as his fingers pointed towards Qin Nan. His face grew red and his words were unable to leave his mouth.Ever since he had awakened his fourth-grade Martial Spirit, the elders and disciples within the family had been treating him with respect and had been trying to curry favors with him. Despite this, he was being repeatedly humiliated by a waste who had only awakened a mere first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.\u201cJust you wait!\u201dAfter restraining himself for a moment, Qin Yu wore an ashen face as he turned to leave, refusing to stay any minute longer as to in fear of being agitated even further. Qin Nan\u2019s expression was indifferent, he didn\u2019t take Qin Yu\u2019s threat to heart. \\n\u201cLet\u2019s inspect the Martial Skills first.\u201dQin Nan promptly calmed his mind and turned around, picking up an ancient book and flipping through it.\u201cSoaring Cloud Step. Upon usage, the body will resemble a cloud, turning into an indistinct trace which caused it to be very difficult for people to catch.\u201d\u201cJade Palm. Upon reaching Large Success, the palm will become like Jade, invulnerable to both water and fire. These palms can carry nine cows and two tigers.\u201d\u201cIsolated Peak Flying Sword.\u201d\u201cDividing Mountain Spear Art.\u201dQin Nan flipped through them in a meticulous manner, and the result did not disappoint him. The strength of these middle-class Martial Skills was indeed incomparable to low-class Martial Skills.However, although Qin Nan had already flipped through roughly ten ancient books, he still hadn\u2019t found a Martial Skill he desired.\u201cHm? Thundercrash Saber Art?\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s gaze was attracted to a floating, yellow ancient book. The characters in the ancient book were extremely extravagant, it was as though it had been engraved with a saber.Qin Nan immediately became excited and picked up the ancient book, \u201cThundercrash Saber Art. A single slash caused the saber to strike as though it were a thunderbolt, its speed like lightning.After perusing it for an hour, Qin Nan promptly nodded his head in satisfaction, \u201cThis is the one!\u201dQin Nan always had an interest in sabers. When he was sixteen years old, he had even created a Saber Art Martial Skill, however, its power had only reached low-class.The current Thundercrash Saber Art was well in line with Qin Nan\u2019s preference.At this moment, a few silhouettes were already within the Martial Skill Pavilion. These people were the geniuses of the Qin Clan; their cultivation had reached the first-layer of Body Tempering Realm and had previously entered in order to select a Martial Skill. \\nUnder the flabbergasted and astonished gaze of these disciples, Qin Nan calmly picked up the ancient book before turning around to leave.\u2026\u2026After Qin Nan returned to the courtyard from the Martial Skill Pavilion, he had discovered that the court gate had been repaired. This caused him to feel slightly stunned. After all, he was currently the \u201cwaste\u201d of the Qin Clan, nobody should even care about him.With doubts in his heart, he pushed open the gate and a deep voice resounded, \u201cOh, you\u2019re back?\u201dQin Nan raised his head and a middle-aged man landed within his line of vision. He looked at Qin Nan with a gentle gaze. Although the clothing of this middle-aged man was simple, the pressure he emitted caused people to shiver.This middle-aged man was the Patriarch of Qin Clan, the only person who had reached the \u201cXiantian Realm\u201d, Qin Tian.Qin Tian glanced at the ancient book in Qin Nan\u2019s hands and was slightly startled. He immediately inspected Qin Nan and said with an astonishment, \u201cNan\u2019er, your cultivation has broken through the first-layer of Body Tempering realm?\u201d(TL note: Nan\u2019er is Qin Nan\u2019s nickname. In Chinese, it\u2019s common to add an \u2018er to their children\u2019s name.)\u201cYeah.\u201d Qin Nan smiled, \u201cThis is all thanks to the Elixir that father has given me.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Qin Tian\u2019s expression revealed ambiguity. Although the effects of the ten Body Tempering Pills were great, Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit was ultimately a mere first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. How was he able to break through so quickly with only ten Body Tempering Pills?Qin Nan noticed his father\u2019s doubt and immediately changed the topic, \u201cFather, why have you visited today?\u201dAs the clan\u2019s Patriarch, Qin Tian had to manage a great number of things. Hence, he rarely met with Qin Nan and was only able to care for him in secret. \\n\u201cYour gate had been shattered by someone, so why would I not visit?\u201d Qin Tian wasn\u2019t in a good mood, \u201cThe next time something like this happens, you can come and tell me. No one bullies the son of I, Qin Tian.\u201dAs Qin Tian spoke, dreadful killing intent emanated from him with tyrannical might.Qin Nan gazed at his father who was filled with killing intent, his heart felt warm as he knew this was because his father cared about him. \u201cFather, I can deal with these kinds of things myself.\u201dQin Tian dubiously nodded. The current Qin Nan and his first-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation was not an easy opponent for most of the disciples within Qin Clan.\u201cNan\u2019er, the reason why your father has come today is to tell you to not be dispirited or give up.\u201d A deep sense of concern could be heard in Qin Tian\u2019s tone, \u201cIf you ever need Elixir for your cultivation, you can look for me. Father believes in you. I believe that you will one day become a powerful expert and assume your own responsibilities.\u201dAs he spoke, Qin Tian\u2019s face revealed a hint of pride.So what if he had a first-grade Huang ranked innate talent? Qin Nan was his son, hence it was within reason that he is incomparably proud of him.Qin Nan was slightly startled then nodded. He engraved each and every one of these words into his heart.As Qin Tian saw Qin Nan\u2019s appearance, he gave out a sigh of relief. There was another reason as to why he had come today, and that was to personally see Qin Nan\u2019s state.After all, he went from a genius to a waste. A normal person would not be able to accept such outcome.He felt at ease when he saw that Qin Nan hadn\u2019t lost his will. \\n\u201cFather, your son has a matter he wishes to trouble you with.\u201d Qin Nan suddenly said.Qin Tian was caught by surprise before he nodded and replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI understand that this request will be a bit excessive but father must trust me\u2026.\u201d Qin Nan carefully considered how to phrase himself; his complexion turned solemn as he said, \u201cI need Elixir. I need one hundred Body Tempering Pills. If you can get two hundred, or even five hundred, then that would be even better!\u201dAfter he spoke, Qin Nan cautiously glanced towards Qin Tian.One had to understand that this request was not only nearly impossible but also very excessive. This was due to the fact Qin Clan did not even hand out hundred Body Tempering Pills a month despite the disciples receiving one a month for their cultivation. However, Qin Nan went as far as to request for five hundred Body Tempering Pills.Not only that, the current Qin Nan was also the \u201cwaste\u201d of the clan. Giving five hundred Body Tempering Pills to a waste; even if it was Qin Tian, he would still suffer colossal pressure from the clan as well as numerous disapprovals.However, the reason as to why Qin Nan needed a large amount of Elixirs was due to the Divine Battle Spirit and its ability to devour Elixirs to increase its grade. If Qin Nan were to personally create Body Tempering Pills, then that would be simply a futile effort. This was why he decided to request these Elixirs from Qin Tian. Qin Nan wanted to use the large amount of Elixirs to increase the grade of the Spirit of the War Soul.This however, would be a quite difficult especially since Qin Nan hadn\u2019t told anyone about the Divine Battle Spirit. This wasn\u2019t because he was afraid of Qin Tian not believing him, but it was because of this matter being outrageously shocking. \\nIf he were to reveal the matter regarding the Divine Battle Spirit, a thousand or even ten thousands of Spirit Medicines wouldn\u2019t be impossible for Qin Tian.As expected, Qin Tian\u2019s expression revealed a trace of surprise, he had never imagined that Qin Nan would request such an exorbitant amount of Elixir. After being silent for a few moments, he then nodded.\u201cAlright!\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As Qin Nan inhaled and exhaled, the Spiritual Qi had turned into two large serpents as it entered his body.After the Divine Battle Spirit had increased to seventh-grade, his cultivation speed had also increased by two-fold.Despite this, Qin Nan still used a full three days to break through to the second-layer of Body Tempering Realm.\u201cBody Tempering Realm. It is divided into ten layers, and each layer strengthens the physique further. The more layers you break through, the more difficult it will be, and the more Spiritual Qi is needed.\u201d\u201cAlthough I possess the Divine Battle Spirit, I still can\u2019t relax. I still need to put in my best efforts.\u201dQin Nan\u2019s gaze was firm and resolute as he promptly immersed himself once again in his cultivation. Even though he had a formidable Martial Spirit, the strength of his second-layer Body Tempering Realm was still relatively weak.\u2026\u2026At this moment, within the Conference Hall of Qin Clan.Qin Tian draped a purple mink fur cloak and sat upright on the seat of the chief. His lofty figure emanated an incorporeal pressure of power.Underneath Qin Tian sat three old men.The leader of the group of old men was dressed in a golden gown and had a flushed complexion. He completely ignored the powerful pressure emanating from Qin Tian. Moreover, he hadn\u2019t even glanced at Qin Tian since he first entered the Conference Hall.His name was Qin Tieba, and he was also the Supreme Elder of Qin Clan, as well as the father of Qin Changkong.The two old men behind Qin Tieba were Qin Clan\u2019s Second Elder and Third Elder. Both of them held a prominent authority within Qin Clan.\\nThe Second Elder and Third Elder cautiously sat in the back, their eyes flickering as their gazes observed Qin Tian and Qin Tieba. Ever since Qin Changkong awakened his Martial Spirit, the Supreme Elder, and the Patriarch\u2019s conflicting views had been very obvious!\u201cWhat is the purpose of calling us here today? Is there something we can help you with?\u201d Qin Tieba held the tea cup with both of his hands as he asked indifferently.The Second Elder and Third Elder also had their own doubts. The time for the clan conference should still be a while from now.\u201cSince the Supreme Elder has asked me, then I\u2019ll be completely truthful,\u201d Qin Tian replied with an indifferent expression on his face, \u201cToday, I have gathered you here to inform you that I, using my title as Patriarch, will transfer a thousand Body Tempering Pills to Qin Nan to cultivate.\u201dThese words were like thunder resounding throughout the hall. Qin Tieba and the two Elder\u2019s complexions immediately erupted.Qin Tieba was dumbstruck to the point where he had even spit out his tea, which was then followed with by an angry voice, \u201cWhat? Qin Tian? What did you say? You actually want to transfer one thousand Body Tempering Pills to that waste? Are you insane?\u201dThe Second Elder and Third Elder\u2019s faces were also filled with shock. That was one thousand Body Tempering Pills!Qin Tian didn\u2019t give them any further thoughts and said in apathy, \u201cSince Supreme Elder doesn\u2019t approve of this, then I can do five hundred Body Tempering Pills. Since I took a step back, shouldn\u2019t you also take a step back?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Qin Tieba yelled with a sharp tone. The few words spoken by Qin Tian within this brief moment caused him to nearly go insane from anger. \\nWhat do you mean you took a step back? From a thousand Body Tempering Pills to five hundred Body Tempering Pills?! You call this taking a bloody step back?\u201cQin Tian. I\u2019ll tell you right now, I will definitely not approve of this! Even my son only gets ten Body Tempering Pills a month. You\u2019d actually give your waste of a son five hundred Body Tempering Pills? You\u2019re out of your mind!\u201d Qin Tieba bellowed in rage.The Second Elder also shook his head, \u201cPatriarch, I also won\u2019t approve of this. Five hundred Body Tempering Pills is equivalent to five months worth of cultivation resources for our Qin Clan\u2019s disciples. We didn\u2019t retort when you gave Qin Nan ten Body Tempering Pills, but five hundred Body Tempering Pills is simply impossible!The Third Elder promptly responded in the same way. At first, he didn\u2019t plan on participating in the argument between Qin Tian and Qin Tieba, however, Qin Tian\u2019s demand was simply too excessive.Qin Tian\u2019s complexion remained indifferent as he said in apathy, \u201cI didn\u2019t call you here today to discuss this matter. I have already decided on this. Don\u2019t worry; from today on, all of my monthly earnings will be used to compensate for this demand.\u201dAs the Patriarch of Qin Clan, he received fifteen Body Tempering Pills per month.According to the calculations, this method wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem and Qin Tian would only suffer a small drawback.\u201cNo! Definitely not! No matter what you say, you are definitely not giving it to that waste\u2026\u201d Qin Tieba sharply shouted. Originally, he wanted to transfer a large amount of Body Tempering Pills to Qin Changkong to cultivate. But now, Qin Tian is taking five hundred Body Tempering Pills at once; how was he going to give Qin Changkong the Body Tempering Pills? \\nBefore Qin Tieba finished his sentence, a thundering voice was heard that promptly resounded within his ears.\u201cThat is what we will do. You can leave!\u201dQin Tian commanded loudly with the power of Xiantian Realm contained in his words, the pressure surged instantaneously.Qin Tieba\u2019s angry complexion immediately paled in an instant. He was unable to withstand the pressure, and neither could the two elders behind him. Their eyes revealed a trace of fear.Qin Tian was Qin Clan\u2019s number one expert, and the sole \u201cXiantian Realm\u201d existence.\u2026\u2026Qin Nan naturally did not know of the matters within the Conference Hall of the Qin Clan. Currently, he was wholeheartedly immersing himself within cultivation.The order of a person\u2019s cultivation in the Body Tempering Realm should start at skin and flesh, then continue to muscles and bones, then viscera and blood.\u201cAlthough the Realm of Body Tempering does increase the overall strength of the physique, it still requires one to cultivate it step by step.\u201d\u201cMy skin and flesh have already become extremely solid, so I should now temper the muscles and bones!\u201dEver since Qin Nan had awakened the Divine Battle Spirit, it was as if he had entered an entirely different world. This caused his thoughts to be increasingly perceptive; he was now able to completely comprehend the more complex and complicated questions from just pondering over it for a short while.Regarding this point though, Qin Nan himself wasn\u2019t quite sure.After pondering over this, Qin Nan proceeded to guide the vigorous Spiritual Qi to flow toward the muscle and bones within his body.As the Spiritual Qi integrated with the muscle and bones, Qin Nan exerted his muscle as well as his bones and struck out, causing a weak explosion to resound. This action showed that the strength of his physique had increased by another fold. \\nTime slowly passed; a full three days had gone by.Qin Nan incessantly guided the Spiritual Qi to circulate throughout his body. Presently, he had entered a state of selflessness. Even Qin Nan himself wasn\u2019t sure how many times the Qi had circulated throughout his body.Suddenly, Qin Nan\u2019s body began to quiver and he felt a dreadful power surging from his body.Qin Nan\u2019s eyes abruptly opened as he stood up. The muscles and bones within his body gave out a series of explosions, as well as an incorporeal power. Powerful Qi within Qin Nan\u2019s center surged, causing the smoke and dust to waft in all directions.\u201cThis is\u2026..the third-layer of Body Tempering Realm!\u201dAs Qin Nan felt the surging power from his body, his eyes couldn\u2019t help but reveal a happy expression. It seemed like the cultivation that he had put his whole heart into for the past few days had not been for naught.However, Qin Nan was unaware that if the news of him breaking through the third-layer in just a few days was to spread, then there\u2019d be a lot of people who would become agitated to the point where they would cough blood and die. This was because the speed of Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation was excessively monstrous.A seventh-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit is, indeed, of no small matter.\u201cHu\u2026. Since Father promised me, then he will definitely bring me five hundred Body Tempering Pills. However, giving me five hundred Body Tempering Pills must be troublesome, so they probably won\u2019t arrive within the next few days.\u201dQin Nan thought about it a little. Although he didn\u2019t know about what happened at the Conference Hall, he could still anticipate up to this point.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough if I were to just focus on increasing my cultivation; I also need to practice my Martial Skills. Only through this would I be able to unleash the full potential of my combat power. Since this is the case, then I\u2019ll head toward Longhu Mountain Range and cultivate the Thundercrash Saber Art!\u201d \\nQin Nan\u2019s gaze flickered as he quickly decided this.Longhu Mountain Range is located in the northern part of Linshui City. The legends spoke of a person who had heard groans of a dragon and the hisses of a tiger within the mountain, hence the name of the Mountain Range.(TL note: Longhu, \u9f99 long means dragon, \u864e Hu means tiger.)Of course, there is no evidence to support this legend, however, there were many Demonic Beasts within the Longhu Mountain Range. Thus, this is the best place for practicing the Martial Skills.Before Qin Nan had awakened his Martial Spirit, he frequently practiced his Martial Skills in the Longhu Mountain Range accompanied by guards from his family.He also attained the Divine Battle Spirit due to getting struck by lightning when he was practicing in the Longhu Mountain Range.However, Qin Nan didn\u2019t imagine that during this training session, he would encounter the people he would least expect.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Foundation Stage of Saber ArtPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7 \u2013 Foundation Stage of Saber ArtAfter Qin Nan had selected a black saber forged from iron and stone, he brought along enough rations for five days before leaving the Qin Clan and proceeding towards Longhu Mountain Range.The distance between Linshui City and Longhu Mountain Range wasn\u2019t far. It had only taken Qin Nan roughly four hours before he had trodden upon the Mountain Range.\u201cThundercrash Saber Art. It emphasizes strength and its momentary explosive power\u2026 If I were to cultivate this Saber Art, then that place would be the best location.\u201dQin Nan pondered for a moment before cautiously proceeding according to his memory.Although he had only walked for three Li, Qin Nan had still spent an hour on this path. This was due to the fact that there were countless Demonic Beasts within Longhu Mountain Range. Qin Nan wanted to wholeheartedly cultivate the Saber Art, thus, he didn\u2019t want to encounter any form of inconvenience.Not long after, a waterfall could be seen through the enormous trees before him.The waterfall had a height of ten meters, the water gushed down from a great height and crashed into the small lake of twenty meters circumference.\u201cThis is the place.\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s eyes gleamed as he promptly surveyed the surroundings.In the end, he didn\u2019t discover anything peculiar, so he put down the rations and grabbed the Black Iron Saber before jumping into the lake.\u201cThundercrash Saber Art, striking like a thunderbolt, with speed like lightning\u2026..\u201dQin Nan stood on the surface of the lake with his eyes closed. Every gesture and motion of the Thundercrash Saber Art emerged within his mind. Soon after, he abruptly flourished the Black Iron Saber which turned into a cold light; slicing the water.Despite the fact that Qin Nan had a cultivation of third-layer Body Tempering Realm, he was only able to cut a small section due to the water resistance. Following this, the water swiftly returned to its former state. \\nSoon after, Qin Nan incessantly sliced the water, slice after slice.The time elapsed; two days passed in a blink of an eye. Within these two days, Qin Nan had been in a selfless state as he incessantly sliced against the water.\u201cNot enough\u2026not enough\u2026\u2026.not enough\u2026.\u201d Qin Nan didn\u2019t know how many times he had chopped, but his gaze was firmly fixed on the surface of the lake. Upon seeing the flickering sword aura pass by, his heart wildly shouted as though he were a mad demon.Following his shout, the speed of Qin Nan\u2019s barrage of slices became increasingly faster and ferocious.However, this was not enough!At this moment, as Qin Nan had entered a selfless state within his cultivation, a transparent and grandiose human avatar gradually emerged from Qin Nan\u2019s back. It emitted dreadful pressure.The Divine Battle Spirit had actually emerged on its own accord.Naturally, Qin Nan had not detected this presence and was still immersed within his incessant slicing. Each slice inhibited his full power in which he let out all at once.Even when his arm started to feel numb, and his muscles began to cramp, each of his slices did not show the slightest hint of stopping.This was Qin Nan\u2019s personality. When he decided on something, he would enter a state in which he would passionately focus on it. Even if he could not achieve his goal, he wouldn\u2019t leave things be, he would never give up!Suddenly, an icy light flickering within Qin Nan\u2019s mind.While in a selfless state and brandishing his saber, his movements abruptly came to a pause. An astonished expression appeared on his face, \u201cThis is\u2026.\u201dQin Nan swiftly reacted by suppressing his astonishment. His eyes were tightly shut and his mind had become clear and calm as he recalled the flickering chill light from a moment ago. \\nAs he stood there, six hours had passed by.Swish!Qin Nan\u2019s eyes abruptly opened, \u201cI understand now!\u201dHe abruptly swung the Black Iron Saber within his hands, and in the instant of his swing, a thunderclap-like sound erupted. This saber aura was like a jolt of lightning, slicing through the water in a blink of an eye.Loud rumblings could be heard, followed by a smooth cut emerging on the surface of the water. The cut remained for a short period of time before returning to its former state.Dividing one into two with the saber, even if it were just water. This was the symbol of foundation stage of the Thundercrash Saber Art!As Qin Nan witnessed this scene, his face couldn\u2019t help but reveal delight. He had never imagined that it would be so easy to cultivate the Thundercrash Saber Art.According to Qin Nan\u2019s initial estimation, he had thought he would need at least five days before reaching this stage.\u201cExcellent. Now that I\u2019ve comprehended the Thundercrash Saber Art, it is time for me to go and test its power!\u201d Qin Nan suppressed the happiness in his heart and a calm expression returned to his face once again.After he had eaten, Qin Nan grabbed the Black Iron Saber as he left the waterfalls and proceeded toward the inner regions of Longhu Mountain Range.Roar!A majestic roar echoed from within the forest, causing the leaves of the surrounding trees to fall down. It was like rain in the form of leaves.Before Qin Nan was a two-meter tall ferocious tiger five different colors encompassing its body. It glared at Qin Nan as it emitted a cold and fiendish aura. The tiger retreated a few steps as though it was preparing to attack.Qin Nan\u2019s face turned solemn, he retrieved the Black Iron Saber and stood motionless.\\nThe ferocious tiger before him was named \u201cMulticolor Tiger\u201d; it was equivalent to a third-rank Demonic Beast and its strength was on par with an existence at third-layer Body Tempering Realm. If one were to be bitten by its sharp teeth, then even if they were at third-layer Body Tempering Realm, they would still meet their end.Hence, Qin Nan couldn\u2019t help but be cautious.A human and a tiger, confronting each other at this place. The Multicolor Tiger seemed to be able to sense Qin Nan\u2019s power. Despite this, it still took a few step back, contracting its body like a bow with no visible intention of engaging.Qin Nan\u2019s eyes gleamed. At this moment, his left foot took a step forward.As the Multicolor Tiger saw his movement, its killing intent immediately erupted and an angry hiss resounded. The Multicolor Tiger performed an immensely powerful leap, its shadow pounced over and arrived above Qin Nan within a blink of an eye. The beast opened its mouth, revealing its sharp and fierce teeth filled with a cold aura as it ruthlessly crunched towards Qin Nan.Qin Nan\u2019s expression showed no trace of fear. Within this instant, his figure flickered and the Black Iron Saber in his right hand suddenly struck out. A thunderclap immediately erupted.The saber flickered as though it were lightning and a \u201cpuchi\u201d sound was heard following this. The body of Multicolor Tiger had actually been split in half as it was in mid-air by this tyrannical strike.Thundercrash Saber Art, a strike which causes death without a wound.\u201cThis Saber Art is indeed immensely powerful. I believe that this Saber Art is at the peak of the middle-class Martial Skills.\u201d As Qin Nan glanced at this bloody scene, he didn\u2019t reveal any visible emotions. Instead, he felt incomparable excitement. \\nHaving the Thundercrash Saber Art caused Qin Nanto be confident enough to battle an existence of fourth-layer Body Tempering realm.\u201cHowever, the current Thundercrash Saber Art is only at small success stage. I still need to continue polish it.\u201d Qin Nan quickly calmed himself, he didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of arrogance.In the following two days, Qin Nan had immersed himself within close combat. Among his opponents, the most bitter battle was when he confronted a Demonic Ape on par with a fourth-layer Body Tempering Realm expert. The Demonic Ape was exceptionally fierce, and although Qin Nan did emerge victorious, he was still severely injured.However, Qin Nan had still reaped a large harvest. The power of the Thundercrash Saber Art had become increasingly powerful.At this moment, Qin Nan was cautiously darting throughout the forest without provoking the group of demonic beasts.Although Qin Nan had mostly recovered from the serious injury caused by the Demonic Ape, he still hadn\u2019t fully recovered. If he were to encounter a Demonic Beast on par with the Demonic Ape, then he would be in an extremely dangerous situation.His current priority was to search for some Elixir of the Heavens and Earth in order to completely recover.As Qin Nan was searching, his heart suddenly felt shock. He felt exceptionally strong Spiritual Qi wafting over from the distance.\u201cThis Spiritual Qi is quite strong, there should be a Elixir of the Heavens and Earth near me.\u201dAs Qin Nan felt shocked in his heart, his figure quickly darted towards the direction of the strong Spiritual Qi. Not too long after, Qin Nan was able to see a small white pond within the depths of the forest. White mist was emitted from the surface of the pond.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s expression changed, \u201cYuan Qi Pond?\u201d \\nThe so-called Yuan Qi Pond was formed when the Qi of the Heavens and Earth accumulated. The Yuan Qi Pond in front of him had a circumference of three meters and was equivalent to fifty Body Tempering Pills.\u201cI never imagined that I\u2019d actually encounter a Yuan Qi Pond. With this, I can fully recover as well as have enough for leftovers.\u201d Qin Nan felt overjoyed. As he was about to take a step forward, two voices unexpectedly resounded from the forest behind him.\u201cBig Brother, is there really a Yuan Qi Pond in front of us?\u201d\u201cWhy would I lie? I got this information from an ancient map, do you think that would be a lie?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great! With the Yuan Qi Pond in our arsenal, us two brothers will definitely break through once more! When the time comes, I will ruthlessly teach Qin Nan a lesson!\u201d\u201cTeach him a lesson? You\u2019re too kind. As long as I have the opportunity, I will turn him into a waste upon wastes!Following the two angry voices, two figures emerged from the forest. As they appeared and was able to see the Yuan Qi Pond, their expression turned to one of delight. However, as they saw this scene, they also saw Qin Nan to the side. Their complexion to immediately turn rigid upon sight.Qin Nan was also dumbstruck, but his face immediately turned extremely ugly.The two people before him turned out to be Qin Yu and Qin Xiao.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - BeheadingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8 \u2013 BeheadingBoth Qin Yu and Qin Xiao had never thought that the person who they were just bad mouthing would actually appear before them. Because of this, the two brothers were dumbstruck.\u201cQin Nan, why are you here?\u201d asked Qin Xiao subconsciously in his bafflement.\u201cHahahaha! Who cares why he\u2019s here!\u201d said Qin Yu, his face revealed a mocking smile as he taunted, \u201cQin Nan! You walk not the road to heaven but come to hell despite the fact that there\u2019s no entrance. We aren\u2019t in the Martial Skill Pavilion right now, and neither are we in the Qin Clan! Today, I want to see the capabilities you boasted of previously!Qin Yu\u2019s energy immediately erupted, His tyrannical aura had actually reached the second-layer of Body Tempering realm.Qin Xiao immediately retracted his expression, his face also revealed a mocking smile. A burst of energy also erupted from his body, revealing his first-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation.The two brothers detested Qin Nan and wanted to taunt Qin Nan at every opportunity given. However, as long as Qin Nan was in the Qin Clan, the two brothers did not dare to make any moves. After all, Qin Nan\u2019s father was the Patriarch of the Qin Clan, an existence which they just couldn\u2019t provoke.Now however, they had actually encountered Qin Nan in Longhu Mountain Range. Even if they were to ruthlessly kill him now, the Qin Clan wouldn\u2019t be able to investigate it.Qin Yu and Qin Xiao\u2019s gaze was fixed on Qin Nan, they were hoping to see the trace of fear on his face.However, Qin Nan disappointed them.When Qin Nan glanced at the two brothers, his face did not reveal even the slightest bit of fear, instead, he smiled indifferently, \u201cWhat capabilities do I have? I\u2019m afraid you shameless and immoral brothers alone do not have the qualifications to know.\u201d \\nQin Xiao and Qin Yu\u2019s complexion changed abruptly, they were enraged to the point where they began trembling. \u201cThis fool is simply too arrogant! Even when death is near, he still boasts shamelessly. \u201c\u201cQin Nan, you\u2019re courting death!With bloodshot eyes, Qin Xiao bellowed loudly as he recalled the humiliation he had previously experienced. His Martial Spirit emerged behind him and three golden rays incessantly flickered.As Qin Xiao grasped the Martial Spirit\u2019s Long Sword, he rushed over as though he were a fierce tiger. The Long Sword viscously darted over as it emanated a chilly aura with the majestic force of a first-layer Body Tempering Realm expert infused within.Qin Yu coldly smiled in the back. He didn\u2019t have any plans to reveal his cards as Qin Xiao alone was already enough to defeat Qin Nan.Previously, the reason Qin Nan had beaten Qin Xiao was only because due to the fact that he had used the ten Body Tempering Pills to breakthrough to first-layer of Body Tempering Realm before Qin Xiao.This time, Qin Xiao had also achieved the first-layer of Body Tempering Realm and even possessed a third-grade Huang ranked Sword Martial Spirit. How could a waste like Qin Nan possibly withstand that?At this moment, Qin Nan who was motionless standing in his former location suddenly struck out!Qin Nan didn\u2019t pull out the Black Iron Saber on his waist, instead, he took a step forward and a fist suddenly exploded forth.This fist was the same low-class Martial Skill which he had used to beat Qin Xiao once before, Collapsing Fist!\u201cYou\u2019re still using this technique to attack me? Let me show you my new Martial Skill, Autumn Aqua Sword Art!\u201d Qin Xiao sneered as he glanced at Qin Nan in disdain. The longsword in his hand left behind remnants, and just like autumn water, it struck down. \\nAutumn Aqua Sword was equivalent to a middle-class Martial Skill. It was suitable for Qin Xiao\u2019s Sword Martial Spirit, and thanks to that, it allowed his strength to become even more powerful.At this moment, the sword and fist collided.The sneer on Qin Xiao\u2019s face suddenly turned stiff within that instant, followed by fear which filled his face; it was completely red as his mouth was left agape. It seemed as though he was trying to say something, however, he was unable to utter a single word. An omnipotent pressure surged over.Rumble!A tremendous explosion resounded. Under this majestic force, Qin Xiao was thoroughly blasted into pieces, turning into countless of fragments of flesh which wafted into the surroundings.A single punch causing an explosive death, not even a painful shriek could be heard as he died before he could let it out.Qin Nan\u2019s face was incomparably tranquil. Dealing with someone like Qin Xiao who only had a cultivation of first-layer Body Tempering Realm with the strength of his third-layer Body Tempering Realm was simple. It was as easy as blowing off dust.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201dQin Yu was mind blown, he watched this scene in dumbstruck. He had never thought that his own brother, Qin Xiao, would be defeated while using his Martial Spirit. Not only that, he was also killed by his opponent, even his corpse was completely dismembered.\u201cQin Nan! You actually dare kill my little brother! You\u2019re courting death!\u201dQin Yu quickly retracted his stunned expression, his anger reached the heavens. He had completely lost his mind, instead, he was filled with a frenzy killing intent!Four golden rays appeared from Qin Yu\u2019s back. Within the golden rays, a Bow emerged as it emitted cold Qi.This was Qin Yu\u2019s fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, Arctic Bow! \\n\u201cDie!\u201dQin Yu roared as he grasped the Arctic Bow. He immediately pulled it into the shape of a full moon and a \u201cPeng\u201d sound could be heard. A frozen arrow suddenly shot forth from the Arctic Bow.This frozen arrow was the strongest move Qin Yu had in his arsenal. The arrow was completely capable of utterly defeating an existence of third-layer Body Tempering realm. It was simply impossible to resist it.However, at this moment, Qin Nan drew his saber. The Black Iron Saber swung forward.Following a thunderclap-like sound, cold saber aura exploded forth like lightning in the void.As a loud noise resounded from the collision, the arrow that had been fired was smashed into pieces by the saber aura, leaving nothing behind. It was not able to withstand the force of the saber.\u201cWhat? Is that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s face was expressionless, \u201cI had only used half of my full strength in that strike.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Qin Yu watched this scene in a daze. He opened his mouth but his throat seemed to be stuck, not a single word was spoken.He used the cultivation of second layer Body Tempering Realm to channel the strongest attack of the fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. Yet, Qin Nan had actually received the attack with only half of his power?\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d\u201cCould it be\u2026 your cultivation has actually broken through the third-layer of Body Tempering realm?!\u201d Qin Yu suddenly came to a realisation. His gaze was fixed on Qin Nan, unable to accept this fact, \u201cHow is that possible? You\u2019re just a first-grade Huang ranked waste! How could you have achieved third-layer of Body Tempering realm?According to the standard, a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit breaking through the first layer of Body Tempering realm was already a heaven-opposing event. How could it have broken through the third layer of Body Tempering realm? Even if you were to have a myriad of Body Tempering Pills, it would still require time to refine them and would still require time to cultivate! \\nIt had only been a few days since the Martial Spirit Awakening!How did Qin Nan break through the third layer of Body Tempering realm within this half month?\u201cFirst-grade Huang ranked waste? Qin Nan coldly smiled, \u201cQin Yu, you really are stupid. You really think I have a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? Alright, today, I will let you understand just who is the so-called waste!\u201dAs Qin Nan spoke, rumblings could be heard from his back. Seven golden rays blossomed and the Divine Battle Spirit emerged in a magnificent manner.\u201cThis\u2014\u2014\u201dQin Yu widened his eyes, his face was filled with shock. The lofty human avatar-like Martial Spirit before him emanated powerful pressure, giving him an urge to kneel down and pray.The seven golden rays behind the lofty Martial Spirit emitted a peerless radiance, it was so bright that he could barely open his eyes!Qin Nan\u2026. actually has a seventh-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit!\u201cThis\u2026 how is this possible\u2026. How is this possible?\u2026..\u201d Qin Yu seemed as if he had forfeited his soul, his face looked lifeless as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? How can you have such a terrifying Martial Spirit\u2026.\u201dAt this moment, Qin Yu suddenly recalled himself ridiculing and mocking Qin Nan, as well as his threats\u2026 Now that he thought about it, he was just extremely ignorant.He had actually called someone who possessed a seventh-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit a \u201cwaste\u201d? He had actually threatened someone who possessed a seventh-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?If people were to know about this, then it\u2019d be equivalent to making a fool out of himself.A seventh-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. This was something that would appear once every fifty years in Linshui City!\u201cIt seems like you have finally understood. Since you\u2019ve understood this, then you may also go and accompany your little brother.\u201d Qin Nan said in an indifferent manner. \\nThe Black Iron Saber within Qin Nan\u2019s hand immediately emanated a buzzing sound followed by killing intent which encompassed his entire body.\u201cAh!\u201d Qin Yu suddenly reacted, his face was filled with fear and a loud cracking sound could be heard as he kneeled to the ground. His head knocked incessantly against the ground, giving off a series of slamming sounds. As he kowtowed, he plead, \u201cPlease\u2026 don\u2019t kill\u2026 don\u2019t kill-\u201dBefore Qin Yu even uttered the word \u201cme\u201d, a saber aura flickered and his entire body was severed of life.As Qin Nan saw the corpse, his face remained expressionless as he remarked, \u201cI\u2019ve said this once before, you better not kneel down and beg me. Because even if you did, I would still not let you go! It seems like you didn\u2019t take my words to heart. In the next world, you brothers should remember that you shouldn\u2019t be so arrogant, shouldn\u2019t look down on people, and definitely should not be shameless and immoral. Otherwise, when that time comes, you won\u2019t even have the right to regret your actions.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, Qin Nan turned around, his gaze barely focused on the two figures.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

During a life and death situation, he definitely would not be lenient.Qin Nan carefully surveyed the surroundings once more. After making sure there were no traces of Demonic Beasts or Martial Artists, he finally let his guard down and walked towards the Yuan Qi Pond. Qin Nan sat cross-legged within Yuan Qi Pond, the Divine Battle Spirit emerged from his back and stood up. The fuzzy human avatar emanated a tyrannical attraction force, causing the Spiritual Qi within the Yuan Qi Pool to surge over.Qin Nan proceeded to guide the Spiritual Qi to nourish his body. Allowing it to restore the injuries caused by the battle with the Demonic Ape. After he had absorbed roughly one-third of the Spiritual Qi within the Yuan Qi Pond, Qin Nan\u2019s body trembled. He felt himself being completely revitalized.\u201cHu! I\u2019ve finally recovered from the injury.\u201d Qin Nan opened his eyes in satisfaction as he thought to himself, \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of Spiritual Qi remaining within the Yuan Qi Pond, enough for me to properly cultivate and break through!\u201dQin Nan promptly closed his eyes once again and wholeheartedly channeled the Divine Battle Spirit in order to absorb the Spiritual Qi into his body.Currently, Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation has reached the third-layer of Body Tempering Realm. His skin, flesh, muscles and bones had already received tentative tempering. Only the viscera and blood remained.Qin Nan\u2019s current objective was to focus on his viscera.Tempering the viscera was different to tempering skin, flesh, muscles, and bones. This was due to the fact that the viscera was exceedingly weak. If one were to make a slightest mistake when tempering, then they could end up injuring themselves.In the past, Qin Nan had heard about a Rogue Cultivator in the Linshui City who was tempering his viscera; he unfortunately made a mistake and exploded. \\nQin Nan cautiously absorbed large amounts of the pure Spiritual Qi and guided it toward his viscera, merging them into it. Hence achieving the best effects of tempering the viscera.A full six hours passed as he cultivated.When the Spiritual Qi of the Yuan Qi Pond was completely absorbed, Qin Nan abruptly opened his eyes. From his body, a dull explosion which sounded similar to the sounds of a drum could be heard.\u201cI\u2019ve broken through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering realm!\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s eyes gleamed with a trace of happiness, he nodded his head in satisfaction.Qin Nan could clearly sense the changes to his body. For example, in the past when he had used the low-class Martial Skill, Collapsing Fist, he was only able to embed external strength to it.However, if he were to use Collapsing Fist now, then he could imbue internal strength to it. If he imbued internal strength into the Collapsing Fist, it would unleash the power of a middle-class Martial Skill.The fourth-layer of Body Tempering realm. Not only would it change the corporeal body, but it also gives you a higher understanding of your own body.\u201cThese two days within the Longhu Mountain Range has allowed me to reap a great harvest. However, returning now would be a bit too early, it would be better if I remain here and continue practicing!\u201dQin Nan pondered for a while before coming to a decision.The five hundred Body Tempering Pills which Qin Tian is acquiring for him would take some time. If Qin Nan was to return to the Qin Clan, then he was only able to painstakingly cultivate by himself. In that case, it would be better to remain in Longhu Mountain Range. Firstly, this would increase his combat experience. Secondly, if his luck was good, then he could even obtain some sort of fortuitous encounter. Similar to how he had discovered the Yuan Qi Pond. \\nQin Nan dedicated the rest of the time to hone himself. He was like a lone wolf within the forest, coming and going, incessantly slaughtering every Demonic Beast he encountered. The Demonic Beasts he had killed this time were of fourth-rank, he had even traded blows with those of fifth-rank.\u201cThe power of my Thundercrash Saber Art is gradually becoming stronger and stronger. I feel like it won\u2019t take too long before I make another breakthrough!\u201d Qin Nan thought to himself as he darted through the forest at full speed.During the two days of fighting, he had discovered that the speed of his saber had become faster and faster. Occasionally, the Demonic Beast would be dead before Qin Nan himself had realized it.This state caused Qin Nan to raise some doubts. He naturally was clear on his own perception, and logically speaking, his perception has yet to reach this level. What exactly caused his increased perception?After Qin Nan pondered over this, he gazed at the Divine Battle Spirit. At the moment, even Qin Nan wasn\u2019t certain about this.\u2026\u2026\u201cIf the Divine Battle Spirit really could increase a practitioner\u2019s perception as well as increase its own grade, then its prowess would be more than what we call \u2018fearsome\u2019\u2026.\u201d Qin Nan thought to himself.As Qin Nan was practicing his skills, a faint voice was suddenly heard from the front.Ever since he had made a breakthrough to the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm as well as strengthened his viscera, Qin Nan had noticed that his vision, hearing, along with other things, had significantly improved. Essentially, any movement within the circumference of twenty meters can be easily detected by Qin Nan.\u201cLet\u2019s check it out,\u201d decided Qin Nan as he retracted his aura. His figure was like a demon as he quietly followed the voice. \\nNot long after, a group of people appeared before Qin Nan. Within the group of people were three middle aged burly men, they gave off the aura of a third-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator. Furthermore, the opposite party\u2019s expression revealed a certain corruptness, it was evident that they have been killing people for over a long period of time.Between the three middle aged burly men was a young girl.Draped over the body of the young girl was a white fur cape and an indigo colored long skirt. This revealed the details of her curvy and delicate figure.However, the young girl\u2019s face was filled with impatience and arrogance.Qin Nan was shocked as he saw this young girl, \u201cIt\u2019s her?\u201dQin Nan recognized this girl and was more than familiar with her. The name of this young girl was \u2018Fang Xue\u2019 and she was the daughter of the Patriarch of Fang Clan.The Qin Clan and the Fang Clan were recognized as the two major clans within Linshui City. Both clans possessed a \u201cXiantian Realm\u201d expert, their subordinates had limitless potential as well as an endless amount of disciples. Furthermore, the Qin Clan had only emerged within the ten or so years after Qin Tian came to power whereas Fang Clan had a history of one hundred years, this in itself was extremely frightening.In the past, there was a rumor that there was an exceptional genius who had an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit within the Fang Clan. However, whether this information is true or not was unknown as there was no proof.Ever since the rise of Qin Clan, the two families had been in a small strife. That was also how Qin Nan had met Fang Xue on several occasions before, it was just that they never properly established a friendship. \\n\u201cWhat is she doing here?\u201d Qin Nan was suspicious.Half a month ago, when the Qin Clan had their Martial Spirit Awakening, the Fang Clan also had it during the same time as well. The Fang Clan was not as regarded because the matter of Qin Nan, an exceptional genius, awakening a waste of a Martial Spirit attracted the attention of everyone else.The Fang Clan was also very low-key, they didn\u2019t let out much news.However, since the Fang Clan has awakened their Martial Spirits, they should be staying within the Clan to carefully cultivate and increase their cultivation. Why did she suddenly bring a few personal guards with her to Longhu Mountain Range?As Qin Nan was being suspicious, Fang Xue suddenly questioned in a sharp tone, \u201cAre we still not there? Did you three idiots properly check the map? If you were to bring me to the wrong place, this young lady will not forgive you!\u201d\u201cMiss, we didn\u2019t go to the wrong place. Other than the shabby cavern that we came across, there really are no other caverns. It\u2019s possibly\u2026it\u2019s possibly because this map is fake\u2026\u201d One of the middle-aged burly man reasoned with his face filled with bitterness.\u201cWhat?\u201d Fang Xue\u2019s complexion turned cold, \u201cHow could the map I brought with me be fake? You better properly look, and if you don\u2019t find it, then at that time, this young lady will properly teach you a lesson!\u201dThe three middle-aged burly men wiped the sweat off their foreheads as they promptly nodded, scattering off into different directions in order to search for it.One of the middle-aged men was walking towards the direction of Qin Nan.Qin Nan remained as still as ever while concealing his figure. To find Qin Nan with the current cultivation of the middle-aged man was practically impossible. There was a qualitative difference between a third-layer Body Tempering Realm practitioner and a fourth-layer Body Tempering Realm practitioner. \\nAdditionally, from the brief conversation between the Fang Clan\u2019s servants, Qin Nan was able to determine that the opposite party\u2019s objective was the same as Qin Yu and Qin Xiao; to search for treasures within Longhu Mountain Range.Qin Nan was slightly curious, he wanted to see what kind of treasure would they find.At this moment, the middle-aged man who was walking toward the direction of Qin Nan suddenly stopped in his tracks. He gazed toward Qin Nan\u2019s location and said with a voice filled with a killing intent, \u201cWho is it? Show yourself immediately!\u201dQin Nan\u2019s face slightly changed. They had actually discovered him?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After one has tempered their viscera, they would be able to completely control their aura. If they stopped emitting their aura, it\u2019d be very hard for people to sense them.At the very least, it should be impossible for a cultivator at the third-layer of Body Tempering Realm to discover Qin Nan.Seeing that he had been discovered, Qin Nan felt a slight headache. However, he didn\u2019t continue to stay silent or did he decide to escape. Instead, he chose to walk out in an open manner as he asked indifferently, \u201cHow did you discover me?\u201dThe middle-aged man seemed slightly dumbstruck. Usually, these who had been discovered tend to seem flustered or bear killing intent. However, the expression of the young man before him was exceedingly calm. This caused him to feel amazed.Soon after, the middle-aged man came to his senses. His face subconsciously displayed a sense of pride, \u201cThe Martial Spirit I had awakened is named \u2018Mistgrass\u2019. Although its rank isn\u2019t very high, it has the ability to sense everything within the circumference of ten meters. Your method of concealing yourself is fascinating and if you weren\u2019t within the range of my ability, then it\u2019d definitely be impossible for me to discover you.\u201dQin Nan\u2019s heart shivered. He hadn\u2019t foreseen this.There were many different kinds of Martial Spirits and an infinite number of them. Although there is a clear segregation between Martial Spirits, their abilities are different.For example, the two brothers, Qin Yu and Qin Xiao. One had a Bow Martial Spirit while the other had a Sword Martial Spirit; both of these Martial Spirits were classified as an Offense type. The Martial Spirit of this middle-aged man before him was classified as a Probe type. \\n\u201cIt seems like I will need to be more cautious in the future. I definitely can\u2019t underestimate everyone because of my cultivation,\u201d thought Qin Nan to himself. This matter could be considered as a warning.At this moment, Fang Xue\u2019s angry voice resounded, \u201cWho!? Who was following this young lady!?\u201dUnder the escort of the other two middle-aged burly men, Fang Xue promptly rushed over. After seeing Qin Nan\u2019s figure, Fang Xue\u2019s originally angry expression immediately changed into one of dumbstruck. This was due to the fact that she hadn\u2019t expected that the person following her was Qin Nan.At this moment, the three burly men swiftly surrounded Qin Nan with brimming killing intent. If Qin Nan were to make the slightest movement, the trio would launch a devastating attack in a blink of an eye.\u201cQin Nan? How could a waste like you be following me?\u2019 Fang Xue thought it was inconceivable. She was filled with suspicion as she enquired, \u201cShouldn\u2019t a waste like you be within the Qin Clan properly practicing? Why were you following me?\u201dThe expressions of the three middle-aged burly men gradually turned into one of dumbstruck. They had never imagined that the youth who had followed them was actually the famous Qin Nan of Linshui City, the number one genius who had turned into the number one waste.At the same time, the three middle-aged burly men slightly let their guard down. Their instincts told them that Qin Nan wouldn\u2019t be able to pose a threat to them with his first-grade Martial Spirit and only half a month worth of cultivation.Qin Nan\u2019s expression immediately turned cold. Initially, he didn\u2019t mind Fang Xue, but who would\u2019ve thought that the second she opened her mouth, the word \u201cwaste\u201d would be blurted incessantly.\u201cWhy does it matter to you whether I\u2019m practicing in the Qin Clan or not?\u201d Qin Nan retorted in an indifferent manner. \u201cMoreover, I hadn\u2019t had the slightest interest in following you. I only happened to pass by, that\u2019s all. Now that you\u2019ve found me, I won\u2019t remain here.\u201d\\nAfter Qin Nan finished speaking, he immediately turned around and began to leave. He felt disinclined to further associate with the opposite party.\u201cWhat did you say!? Stop right there! If you don\u2019t kowtow and apologize to this lady immediately, you won\u2019t be leaving today!\u201d Fang Xue\u2019s voice was incomparably sharp.Fang Xue\u2019s mood today was simply terrible. This was due to the fact that she had purchased an extremely expensive ancient map in Linshui City. Following this, she brought her guards along with her to search for the treasure in the map.She wanted to secretly obtain the treasure and then bring it back to the clan. This would definitely cause her parents to gain a newfound respect for her.However, they had already searched for four hours as they followed the map, but other than the shabby cavern, there wasn\u2019t anything else. Although Fang Xue refused to admit it, her heart was already clear about the fact that this ancient map was a scam.To think that she, the young lady of the Fang Clan, with a somewhat important background, had unexpectedly been scammed. How could she not be angry?Now that Qin Nan had appeared before her with an attitude of contempt towards her, it caused Fang Xue\u2019s already terrible mood to immediately erupt. What qualifications does a waste like you have to talk to me in this manner? Qin Nan, do you actually think that you\u2019re still the number one genius?It was simply asking for death!\u201cKowtow and apologize?\u201d Qin Nan felt this was completely absurd, he couldn\u2019t help but retort, \u201cIs there a problem with your head? You want me to kowtow and apologize? Why should I kowtow and apologize to you? Since you like kowtowing and apologizing so much, why don\u2019t you kowtow and apologize to me?\u201d \\nOriginally, Qin Nan thought the two brothers, Qin Yu and Qin Xiao were immoral and shameless. Who would\u2019ve thought that this Fang Xue was even worse than them. The moment she saw him, she wanted him to kowtow and apologize.\u201cWhat!? You dare scold me?\u201dAs Fang Xue was being incomparably rude and unreasonable, her killing intent immediately erupted, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t because you were the young lord of Qin Clan, then a waste like you wouldn\u2019t even have the qualifications to kowtow and apologize to me! Men! Heed my order! I want you to sever his limbs and destroy his Dantian!\u201dQin Nan\u2019s face turned increasingly icy. He had never thought that this Fang Xue would actually be arrogant to this degree. If she didn\u2019t like you, she\u2019d sever your limbs and destroy your Dantian. This girl, just how malicious of a heart did she have?The three middle-aged burly men showed no hesitation, they only felt pity for him. They charged toward Qin Nan and simultaneously unleashed a punch. They were already accustomed to this kind of order from Fang Xue. The three men have no idea how many limbs they had already severed, and Dantians they have destroyed under Fang Xue\u2019s command.Fang Xue watched this scene in a mocking manner. This insignificant first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit waste actually dared to speak to me in such a rude manner. This was simply asking for death.Presently, Fang Xue could almost visualize the appearance of Qin Nan laying on the ground, shrieking miserably.\u201cGood! I\u2019ll play along with your injustice and animosity. The moment you see me, you want to sever my limbs and destroy my Dantian? Then let me see how exactly you\u2019re going to do so!\u201d Qin Nan was enraged to the point where he even began to laugh. He immediately took a large stride and the aura of a fourth-layer Body Tempering Realm immediately surged!\\nBuzz!In this instant, Fang Xue\u2019s arrogant smile froze. She could only feel immense pressure confining her, causing her to feel suffocated. In a split second, her former disdain and ridicule had completely dispersed, and in its place was fear which had brewed within her.The three burly men\u2019s suddenly stopped in their tracks, they were completely stunned.The famous waste who possessed a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was actually emanating the aura of a fourth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator? How was this possible?\u201cKill him! Kill him immediately!\u201d In this split second, Fang Xue seemed as though she had become insane as her sharp voice resounded.A \u2018waste\u2019 like Qin Nan was actually emitting such an incredibly tyrannical aura? Fang Xue was simply unable to accept this. She only knew of a single way to deal with this situation, and that was to have Qin Nan die. No matter what, Qin Nan must die!The faces of the three burly men turned solemn as they promptly recovered from their shock. Their Martial Spirits emerged as yellow rays simultaneously arose from each of their backs.All three of these men possessed a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.Following this, the three middle-aged men charged over synchronously. They gave off an ambiance that seemed as though their aura and Martial Spirit had merged together.\u201cKill!\u201dThe three burly men immediately struck out at the same time. They all utilized the exact same technique which gradually merged together, forming a formidable Martial Skill. Its power was boundless and caused one to unable to move, simply unable to escape or avoid.\u201cNo wonder these three could become Fang Xue\u2019s guards. Possessing this kind of ability despite only having first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirits as well as third-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation\u2026 However, it isn\u2019t enough to obstruct my Saber!\u201d \\nQin Nan\u2019s eyes revealed a trace of ruthlessness; he was not afraid or was he afraid. The Black Iron Saber in his hands swung down along with a thunderous sound, turning into a slice of cold light.\u201cAh\u2014\u2014\u201d Three frigid shrieks resounded but was cut short. It was as if their throats were suddenly ripped off, causing them to be unable to let out any sounds.Blood wafted into the surroundings as the three middle-aged men were completely annihilated by Qin Nan\u2019s single strike.Fang Xue widened her eyes and her former delicate and beautiful face turned into one of fear in a blink of an eye. The bloody scene before her was like a gigantic claw which latched onto her body, causing her to stop breathing.Her guards were defeated? Even if they were to face a fourth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator, they should still be able to hold their ground. Presently however, they weren\u2019t even able to obstruct a single strike from their opponent?Just how fearsome was the strength of this number one \u2018waste\u2019 named Qin Nan?\u201cYoung lady Fang, why aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d At this moment, Qin Nan\u2019s voice echoed in Fang Xue\u2019s ears, \u201cDidn\u2019t you just say that you were going to sever my four limbs and destroy my Dantian? Excuse me for accidentally killing your guards, they are no longer able to complete their mission to sever my limbs and destroy my Dantian. In that case, are you planning to personally annihilate me?\u201d As Fang Xue heard this, she felt as though she was hit by lightning, her body shook and her face paled.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The blood in front of her eyes gave birth to an incessant fear, causing her heart to collapse and left behind only her survival instinct.\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me. I promise I won\u2019t do this again in the future, please\u2026.!\u201dQin Nan was indifferent, not a slightest trace of emotion could be seen on his face.Fear gradually grew in Fang Xue\u2019s heart as she hastily pleaded, \u201cQin Nan, I am the young lady of Fang Clan. You shouldn\u2019t kill me! If you were to kill me\u2026I\u2026.My father will definitely find you and cause trouble for you\u2026and\u2026and also my brother\u2026. My brother has awakened a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. If you were to kill me..he\u2026he will definitely avenge me\u2026\u201dQin Nan furrowed his eyebrows. He naturally knew of Fang Xue\u2019s older brother. He was the Young Lord of the Fang Clan and was named Fang Rulong. In the past, Qin Nan had encountered him several times and had even held a conversation with him, it was just their relationship wasn\u2019t deep at all. However, Qin Nan didn\u2019t expect that Fang Rulong would awaken a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.This caused Qin Nan to suspect that something wasn\u2019t right. Normally speaking, if Fang Clan were to awaken a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, they would immediately spread this information throughout the city and hold a banquet to celebrate. After all, a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was something one would rarely come across in ten years worth of time in Linshui City.Although Qin Nan did have suspicions, he didn\u2019t ponder on this any longer. He sneered at Fang Xue and said, \u201cFang Xue, ah Fang Xue. You really are interesting. Even at this moment, you\u2019re still threatening me. This is Longhu Mountain Range, and even if I were to kill you now, who would know?\u201d\\nFang Xue\u2019s complexion changed in a blink of an eye, her small mouth was gaping. However, she was unable to let a single word out.At this moment, sword aura flickered and Fang Xue\u2019s life was immediately severed. Her eyes were wide open with a hint of disbelief even at death\u2019s door.Qin Nan gazed at her corpse and said indifferently, \u201cI forgot to tell you that I\u2019m not afraid of your father because my father is also the Patriarch of the Qin Clan. Moreover, I\u2019m definitely not afraid of your brother because he doesn\u2019t even hold a place in my eyes.\u201dAfter he had finished speaking, Qin Nan turned around and walked away. However, before taking even a single step, he immediately turned around and looted over twenty Body Tempering Pills from Fang Xue\u2019s corpse as well as an archaic map.\u201cThis girl is indeed very wealthy,\u201d Qin Nan thought to himself as he put away the Body Tempering Pills. He then shifted his gaze to the archaic map.Qin Nan\u2019s current vision was naturally able to see the age of this archaic map; it was indeed very old.\u201cAccording to the conversation between Fang Xue and her guards, they had discovered a cavern based on the map. However, this cavern was too run down and there were no treasures within it whatsoever. Presently, I don\u2019t have anything to do. I might as well go take a look at this cavern and see if I can find anything\u2026\u201d decided Qin Nan.Either way, there was one day remaining before he had to return to the Qin Clan, thus he still had plenty of time. He was only going to take a look, it wouldn\u2019t waste much time. Perhaps he could even find something.Qin Nan followed the map slowly and walked towards the location on the map. Soon enough, a cavern appeared before him.\\nThis cavern was encompassed by a dense pile of trees with the height of the entrance being roughly two people tall. Overgrown weeds surrounded the cavern and the place seemed ordinary.Qin Nan proceeded to enter the cavern. However, as he entered, his face revealed a trace of disappointment.The interior of the cavern was approximately ten Chi deep; one could see the end of the cavern with just the naked eye. Other than the heap of overgrown weed, hollow marks could also be seen on the walls. There was simply nothing special about this place at all.\u201cIt seems like this archaic map is indeed just a scam.\u201d Qin Nan lightly shook his head as he prepared to leave.Suddenly, Qin Nan noticed a palm imprint on the cavern wall, this imprint was deeply indented into the cavern wall. The details of the imprint were extremely distinct and was emanating a strand of a chilling intent.\u201cHuh?\u201d Qin Nan turned suspicious. His instinct told him that this palm imprint was different.Qin Nan promptly walked towards it, carefully inspecting the palm imprint. He had even retrieved the Black Iron Saber from his waist and probed the imprint using it. However, Qin Nan shook his head when he realized that there was no mechanism behind the palm imprint. Perhaps it was something left behind from someone else\u2019s training.However, at this moment, Qin Nan\u2019s entire body suddenly shivered.\u201cHow did the Divine Battle Spirit appear on its own?\u2026\u201dQin Nan felt a great shock, he didn\u2019t even have the time to ponder over this before a ferocious and tyrannical force erupted from the ordinary-looking palm imprint on the cavern wall. It was as if heaven-defying pressure violently gushed out.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d Qin Nan was completely stunned. If the Divine Battle Spirit hadn\u2019t envelop himself in its aura, then Qin Nan wouldn\u2019t have been able to withstand the aura with just his cultivation; he would\u2019ve been ripped into pieces by it. \\nAt this moment, Qin Nan gathered his thoughts once again. The palm imprint in front of him is definitely not a common imprint, but it was something an expert had left behind. This caused the palm imprint to contain an imposing power that lingered in this area.\u201cIt seems like the treasure described in the archaic map is actually this palm imprint. Fang Xue\u2019s cultivation was too low, that\u2019s why she was unable to sense the Will within the palm imprint. If it wasn\u2019t for the Divine Battle Spirit, then I wouldn\u2019t have noticed it either!\u201dQin Nan took a deep breath and gazed at this dreadful palm imprint, his face couldn\u2019t help but to show a hint of excitement.Now that he had the Divine Battle Spirit protecting his body, he was no longer afraid of the palm imprint wounding him. Instead, he decided to observe and ponder upon this palm imprint in order to further strengthen himself.There were many different kinds of Martial Skills within the Martial World, cultivation was dependant on one\u2019s Will. The stronger the Will, the more formidable one strength will be.It would be of great use if one were to comprehend the Will embedded in the palm imprint.Qin Nan didn\u2019t waste any time as his figure immediately sat cross-legged in front of this cavern wall. His gaze was fixated on the palm imprint; his mind was currently as in a state of deep focus.Boom! Boom! Boom!In an instant, a series of explosions occurred within Qin Nan\u2019s brain.A frightening and powerful palm descended out of the blue, it felt as though it was crushing Qin Nan and blasting him in pieces. At this moment, the Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s human avatar slightly raised its head, causing this intense and frightening palm to come to a stop and float within Qin Nan\u2019s mind. \\nQin Nan submerged himself within his mind and wholeheartedly tried to sense the portion of Will.\u201cThis palm contains a Will that is indeed heaven-defying. When the palm descended, it felt as though there was nothing it could not destroy and nothing it could not extinguish,\u201d Qin Nan came to an understanding and unconsciously, his heart began to refine itself.This process was a type of Will Tempering.Time slowly passed by, Qin Nan had been sitting in front of the palm imprint for an entire day.At this moment, Qin Nan was sitting upright in front of the cavern wall. His body did not emit the slightest bit of aura, even his breathing had stopped. It was as though he had become a statue.Following this, Qin Nan\u2019s eyes abruptly opened. It was as though a chill and fierceful substance jet out from his eyes and entered the cavern wall.At this moment, the incorporeal aura emanated by Qin Nan emitted heaven-defying pressure, it far exceeded the pressure of a fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm expert.\u201cThe harvest of a whole day\u2019s comprehension is indeed great! Unfortunately my cultivation level is too low, I could only scratch the surface of this great palm imprint.Qin Nan shook his head. He was now able to confirm that this palm imprint was definitely left behind by a Martial King expert.Naturally, the Will of a Martial King was not something Qin Nan was capable of comprehending, he was only able to scratch the very tip of the iceberg. Additionally, if Qin Nan hadn\u2019t possessed the Divine Battle Spirit, then it would be possible that he would\u2019ve already been wounded by the Will of the Martial King.\u201cNow\u2026. let\u2019s test my Thundercrash Saber Art!\u201dQin Nan\u2019s expression was tranquil as he pulled out the Black Iron Saber from his waist and slowly closed his eyes. After an incense worth of time passed by, Qin Nan\u2019s eyes snapped open. The Black Iron Saber in his hand instantly struck out. \\nRumble!A thunderous explosion immediately erupted.A icy saber ray struck forth containing a heaven-defying aura. It was as if Qin Nan\u2019s body had fused together with the saber and sliced towards the cavern wall. In an instant, a deep saber slash immediately appeared on the wall.\u201cThis strike contains my intent. I\u2019m afraid that the current me has already taken a step into the realm of One with the Saber! Additionally, I reckon the average fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm expert would not be able to obstruct this strike!Qin Nan was delighted.The harvest from visiting this cavern had been immense; if Qin Nan hadn\u2019t had the support of this palm imprint, then he wouldn\u2019t have been able to step into the realm of One with the Saber.\u201cAlright. It has already been five days since I entered Longhu Mountain Range. By now, father should have prepared everything. Hence, it\u2019s time to head back to the Qin Clan\u2026.\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s eyes flashed and immediately exited the cavern and descended the mountain.At this time, in Linshu City, the Qin Clan had begun the monthly Clan Meeting.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

People were simply unable to guess what he was thinking.Beneath him was the Supreme Elder, Qin Tieba, as well as the Second Elder and Third Elder. During this period of time, the three elders of Qin Clan wore very ugly faces, especially Qin Tieba. His complexion was ashen, and his eyes indistinctly flashed a killing intent.Beneath the three Elders were the attendees of Qin Clan; there were 30 people in total.No one in the Hall of Conference said a single word. The atmosphere was heavy.Those present understood that what happened within the Qin Clan a few days ago was the cause. It was due to Qin Clan\u2019s Patriarch, Qin Tian, he no longer received any cultivation resources from the Qin Family. Instead, he withdrew five hundred Body Tempering Pills and gave them all to Qin Nan.This was an entire five hundred Body Tempering Pills! That is equivalent to five months of what all the disciples within the Qin Clan received! If Qin Nan was still the former number one genius, then that\u2019d be a different story. However, who was the current Qin Nan? He was the number one waste of the Qin Clan!Giving five hundred Body Tempering Pills to a waste was simply outrageous!\u201cOur Qin Clan will commence a Clan Meeting once a month,\u201d Qin Tian finally said, while his face was expressionless, \u201cThe Clan Meeting is to report all the smaller and bigger matters that have happened, and then have everyone give their input on them. As the Patriarch, I don\u2019t understand why no one has anything to report? If no one is going to report anything, then I will declare the end of the Clan Meeting!\u201d \\nAs the attendees heard this, each and every one of them was dumbstruck. Ever since the Qin Clan became the second ranked Clan of Linshui City, a case of the Clan Meeting ending early was unprecedented.\u201cI have something to say!\u201d at this moment, a chilly voice resounded.Everyone\u2019s gaze immediately looked toward the person who spoke. It happened to be Qin Changkong!According to past regulations of the Qin Clan, disciples were not permitted to participate in Clan Meetings. However, Qin Changkong had become the number one genius of the Qin Clan, so naturally he would have the qualifications to participate.To a certain extent, one could also say that Qin Changkong\u2019s status was exceedingly important.The current Qin Changkong was wearing white clothing from top to bottom, his cuffs embossed with gold, and it gave people an impression of grandeur about him. Additionally, the aura emanating from Qin Changkong\u2019s body stated that his cultivation had reached the third-layer of Body Tempering Realm!If one were to solely rely on the aptitude of a fifth grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, then it\u2019d be impossible to reach this state within the period of ten or so days. However, Qin Changkong is the number one genius, and his cultivation resources were naturally abundant. By relying on those cultivation resources, Qin Changkong was able to quickly reach his current state.The third-layer of Body Tempering Realm wasn\u2019t anything special within the Qin clan, but one also had to understand that Qin Changkong had reached this cultivation stage within the period of ten or so days!If one thought about it, it would be impossible to know what level Qin Changkong would achieve in the future.The attendees in the Hall of Conference simultaneously came to this realization. Each of them looked at Qin Changkong with their gazes holding respect and admiration, and there were even some wanting to curry favors with him. \\nSensing everyone\u2019s gazes, Qin Changkong felt extremely satisfied. The arrogance on his face was increasingly visible. Displaying himself was one of the reasons he chose to participate in today\u2019s Clan Meeting!A strict look flashed in Qin Tian\u2019s eyes, yet his face was still tranquil as he said, \u201cThere is no harm in saying what one thinks.\u201dQin Changkong gazed at Qin Tian, and a momentary ridicule appeared on his face as he followed up with a cold voice, \u201cPatriarch, as the number one genius of Qin Clan, I only receive ten Body Tempering Pills per month, and including the care of the Clan, it would not exceed more than twenty Body Tempering Pills! I\u2019d like to inquire Patriarch on why you decided to give this waste, Qin Nan, five hundred Body Tempering Pills? Is it because he is your son?\u201dThe atmosphere suddenly turned more tense.The attendees instantly understood what was going on. This time, Qin Changkong had no intention of playing nice.The attendees gazes subconsciously turned to look toward Qin Tieba. While Qin Tieba seemed tranquil at that moment, the attendees were able to make out a slight chill in his eyes.Qin Tian creased his brow, his tone as tranquil as before, \u201cThe five hundred Body Tempering Pills was to take care of my son. Additionally, from now on, I will no longer receive any cultivation resource from the Qin Clan. If one were to calculate this, that means Qin Clan is actually not in a loss!\u201dAs he finished his sentence, a loud laugh suddenly resounded.Qin Tieba\u2019s figure stood up, his face filled with ridicule, \u201cQin Clan not being at a loss? Qin Tian, you ought to know that our Qin Clan\u2019s Body Tempering Pills every year only amount to that much. With you withdrawing five hundred Body Tempering Pills for your waste of a son, then what about everyone else? As a Patriarch, you don\u2019t place the cultivation resources on the genius, instead, you give them to the waste\u2026 I believe you should no longer hold the responsibility of being the Patriarch of Qin Clan!\u201d \\nAs this sentence was said, it was as though a thunderclap erupted within the Hall of Conference.The attendees present revealed deeply shocked faces. They would never have imagined that Qin Changkong and Qin Tieba, the father and son pair, would unexpectedly revolt against Qin Tian and impeach his position within the Qin Clan! \u2026\u2026It took Qin Nan a little time before he finally returned to the Qin Clan. On the way home, he didn\u2019t greet anyone.However, Qin Nan could sense that the Qin Clan disciples he passed by were looking at him with their eyes brimming with jealousy. Some of them were even relentlessly ridiculing him with words.Qin Nan naturally didn\u2019t bother with them, however, this only made him realize how odd it was.\u201cIt seems like Father has secured five hundred Body Tempering Pills for me!\u201d Qin Nan thought again, and guessed the source of their reactions, but he couldn\u2019t help but be delighted in his heart.Right now, he was the number one waste of Qin Clan. Receiving five hundred Body Tempering Pills would naturally cause the disciples of Qin Clan to be envious toward Qin Nan. Some even resented him for it, thus, those who mocked him earlier were still within reason for their actions.As Qin Nan guessed this, he immediately accelerated his walking toward the courtyard.When Qin Nan entered, an emotionless voice was heard, \u201cYoung Lord, this is the five hundred Body Tempering Pills given to you by the Patriarch.\u201dThis young man\u2019s skin was dark, and his complexion was ice cold. His body emanated an evil aura that caused people\u2019s hearts to palpitate and not approach him.Qin Nan naturally knew who this was; he was the personal bodyguard of Qin Tian, Tie San. Within the Qin Clan, his cultivation was only second to Qin Tian, while he was also Qin Tian\u2019s trusted aide. \\n\u201cThank you Uncle San!\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s complexion was respectful, while his gaze immediately looked at the rows of Jade Bottles. As he felt the rich Spiritual Qi emanating from the Jade Bottles, his heart couldn\u2019t help but feel excitement.This was a full five hundred Body Tempering Pills. If I were to use all these Body Tempering Pills, then to what level would the Divine Battle Spirit reach?Sensing Qin Nan\u2019s movement, a chill lit up within the unmoving eyes of Tie San.Qin Nan immediately calmed his excitement and raised his head to ask, \u201cUncle San, where\u2019s my father?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s currently participating in the Clan Meeting,\u201d Tie San said emotionlessly as he turned around to leave the courtyard. However, after taking a few steps, he suddenly stopped.Qin Nan felt that something was wrong, \u201cUncle San, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dTie San stared at Qin Nan. In that instant, the chill within his eyes was fully displayed as he said, \u201cQin Nan, I don\u2019t know what exactly you\u2019re trying to do. Currently, you\u2019re just a waste, yet you still want your Father to give you five hundred Body Tempering Pills! Due to this matter, do you know what you have caused your Father to become?Qin Nan was stupefied, he could sense something was going on, \u201cUncle San, did something happen?\u201dThe chill in Tie San\u2019s eyes turned increasingly heavy as he said with loathing, \u201cYou still don\u2019t know what has happened? I\u2019ll tell you now. Right now at the Clan Meeting, the Supreme Elder is planning on using this matter to accuse your Father of misconduct! If your father is no longer the Patriarch of Qin Clan, then it would all be because of you!As he said this, Tie San\u2019s body couldn\u2019t help but emanate a slight murderous intent. \\nAlthough Tie San didn\u2019t interact much with Qin Nan, his impression of Qin Nan was very good. It was to the extent that he would personally assure Qin Nan\u2019s security when he was not aware of it.However, ever since he found out about Qin Nan requesting the five hundred Body Tempering Pills from his father, a huge change occurred in his view regarding Qin Nan.A waste like you actually wants five hundred Body Tempering Pills? Wasn\u2019t it evident that he was just framing his own father?Tie San took a deep breath and restrained his murder intent before he turned around to leave. He did not want to stay a second longer in this place.However, before Tie San took a step out of the court gate, an angry voice suddenly erupted, \u201cThey dare to accuse MY father of misconduct?\u201dA lofty aura accompanied the angry voice, and it was as if it exploded in an instant.This caused Tie San to be shocked. He subconsciously turned around and saw Qin Nan with an overwhelming rage that could reach the heavens. He sensed the vigorous strength emanating from Qin Nan\u2019s body, causing his face to turn dumbstruck while his eyes revealed deep shock.This\u2026..How did this happen?Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation had actually reached the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In that case, why don\u2019t you show me what abilities you have to impeach me!\u201dAs Qin Tian spoke, majestic True Qi violently surged from his body.Body Tempering Realm is equivalent to tempering the body. Xiantian Realm was the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth, absorbing and transforming it into one\u2019s own True Qi.The expressions of the present crowd simultaneously changed as they felt immense pressure, it was as though even breathing had become exceedingly difficult.This was the innate difference between Body Tempering Realm and Xiantian realm.Qin Tian stood up and observed the audience before his gaze finally landed on Qin Tieba as he said, \u201cI, Qin Tian, am the only Xiantian Realm expert within the Qin Clan. If you want to impeach me, then I\u2019d like to see just what qualifications you, the Supreme Elder, have to be on an equal standing as the Fang Clan.\u201dAs Qin Tian finished speaking, the faces of a large majority of the crowd changed abruptly.Qin Clan and Fang Clan are the two major Clans of Linshui City, they were also incessantly battling against each other. Moreover, the Patriarch of Fang Clan was also a Xiantian Realm expert. If Qin Clan didn\u2019t have Qin Tian, the Qin Clan definitely wouldn\u2019t be on par with the Fang Clan.\\nQin Tieba remained unperturbed, instead, a mocking smile appeared on his face, \u201cQin Tian, I assume you\u2019re going to rely on your cultivation to deal with this affair? Do you think you are the only one who can support the Qin Clan?The crowd was dumbstruck. What did Qin Tieba imply? Could it be that Qin Tieba has broken through and achieved Xiantian Realm?Qin Tieba stood up, he was apathetic about the pressure that Qin Tian had released. Instead, he said in an indifferent manner, \u201cLet me tell everyone some news today. Two days ago, my son, Qin Changkong, was acknowledged by Mystic Spirit Sect and was selected to become their disciple! Furthermore, Mystic Spirit Sect will visit Linshui City to conduct a disciple selection in five days!In this instant, the entire Hall of Conference turned silent once again, even the current Qin Tian\u2019s expression changed dramatically.Mystic Spirit Sect!Within the entire Luohe Kingdom, Mystic Spirit Sect was one of the four Great Sects. Its strength was placed in the top echelon of the Luohe Kingdom and was deemed to be exceedingly powerful. For youths, this was the Holy Land of Martial.There hadn\u2019t been a single disciple in the history of Qin Clan that had entered Mystic Spirit Sect.An attendee\u2019s breathing became increasingly rapid, \u201cSupreme Elder, is this true? The selection period for Mystic Spirit Sect has always been once in three years. Currently, it has only been less than two years since the previous selection!\u201d\u201cThe selection this time had been shifted to an earlier date,\u201d said Qin Tieba with pride.Wa!The crowd finally reacted to his words, it was as if they had all taken a deep breath at same time. Their gazes were fixed on Qin Changkong; if their previous look were of revere and intentions of currying favors, then their current gaze would be one brimming with passion and hope! \\nIn an instant, Qin Tian\u2019s position in their heart had instantly hit an all time low.So what if Qin Clan didn\u2019t have a Xiantian Realm expert?As long as Qin Changkong had become a disciple of Mystic Spirit Sect, then the Qin Clan wouldn\u2019t just become the superior clan of the two, they could even pressure the Fang Clan and become the true Overlord of Linshui City. Their future was boundless and was far better in comparison to the benefits that Qin Tian could possibly bring to the Clan!\u201cEveryone,\u201d Qin Changkong said, his face was filled with endless pride and a strong sense of disdain as he glanced directly into Qin Tian\u2019s eyes, \u201cThe Patriarch of Qin Clan is unable to differentiate public and private affairs and had transferred five hundred Body Tempering Pills to a waste. In my opinion, someone like this can no longer be the Patriarch of the Qin Clan.\u201dQin Tian\u2019s complexion changed, his heart gave rise an ill premonition.Although he knew that Qin Tieba would use this Clan Meeting as an opportunity to revolt, he hadn\u2019t expected that Qin Changkong had actually become a disciple of Mystic Spirit Sect.Thus, although Qin Tian had Xiantian Realm cultivation and was the number one expert of the Qin Clan, it had absolutely no meaning at all.Qin Tian took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down as he quickly said, \u201cEveryone, although I, Qin Tian had indeed withdrawn five hundred Body Tempering Pills for my son, I have already used my own cultivation resources in exchange!\u201d\u201cFurthermore, I, Qin Tian can boast about something. Ever since I\u2019ve assumed the responsibility of Patriarch, I have dedicated myself to the Qin Clan in order to make it become even more powerful. It has been fifty years since I assumed the responsibility of Patriarch, and in these past fifty years, I don\u2019t dare to say how many things I\u2019ve accomplished. However, I do dare to say that the Qin Clan has become powerful under my guidance!\u201d \\n\u201cEver since the Martial Spirit Awakening when my son had went from a genius to a waste, the Clan\u2019s evaluation of him had dropped drastically. Not only am I the Patriarch of the Qin Clan, I am also Qin Nan\u2019s father. This was the first request Qin Nan had ever asked, thus, as a father, I am obligated to fulfill his request. Furthermore, I\u2019ve previously declared that my future cultivation resources will be returned to the clan. This is all I wanted to say. I hope the you will continue to support me!\u201dEvery word and sentence was very deep and low; it came from the bottom of the heart of Qin Tian.When Qin Tieba and Qin Changkong watched this scene, their faces didn\u2019t show a slightest hint of sympathy. Instead, their mocking expression turned increasingly visible.The crowd sunk into silence once again. At this moment, the Second and Third Elder who sat behind Qin Tieba stood up simultaneously as they said, \u201cI support Qin Changkong. Qin Tian should no longer assume the position as the Patriarch of the Qin Clan!\u201dWhen the Second and Third Elder took the initiative to speak, the attendees immediately erupted. Practically the entire crowd spoke against Qin Tian, it was clear they didn\u2019t take Qin Tian\u2019s word to heart.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Qin Tian, you don\u2019t have the qualifications to be the Patriarch anymore.\u201d\u201cWhat a joke! What does the development of our Qin Clan have anything to do with you? This was all due to our own efforts!\u201d\u201cI support the impeaching of Qin Tian! I\u2019ve been tired of you since a long time ago. You would actually give that many Body Tempering Pills to that waste of a son? Is this something you should do? You should be giving these Body Tempering Pills to Young Master Qin Changkong, that\u2019d make more sense!\u201d \\n\u201cImpeach Qin Tian! We definitely shouldn\u2019t let this kind of person continue being the Patriarch of our Qin Clan!\u201dThe entire Hall of Conference blew up, all of the attendees wore either an expression of hesitation or resent. Some of these attendees became angry to the point where their killing intent could be seen. If it weren\u2019t for Qin Tian\u2019s cultivation, they would have already rushed up to him and beat him up.Qin Tieba and Qin Changkong exchanged gazes, one could see a great delight within their eyes.Qin Tian\u2019s figure flashed past, his face paled. He gazed at the attendees who were filled with resentment, rage and killing intent filled their faces. In this instant, it was as if a tremendous saber had ferociously stabbed his heart, causing Qin Tian to feel heart-tearing, lung-splitting pain.Qin Tian had never thought that the people of the Qin Clan would actually show resentment towards him!\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026\u201d At this time, Qin Tian suddenly faced toward the skies and let out a laugh, his aura suffered an abrupt and devastating decline. It was as though he had lost his three souls and six senses. As he staggered, he remarked, \u201cSo it\u2019s like this\u2026. it\u2019s actually like this\u2026 Since it is like this, then I\u2019ll promise\u2026.\u201dBefore Qin Tian finished speaking, Qin Tieba began to feel excitement. He had been lusting for the position of Patriarch for many years, however, his cultivation simply wasn\u2019t comparable to Qin Tian\u2019s. Thus, he could only endure.However, ever since Qin Nan became a waste, his son had become the number one genius of the Qin Clan..Thus, Qin Tieba took advantage of the Clan Meeting to start a revolt. As long as he was able to remove Qin Tian from his position in the Clan, Qin Tieba would be able to become the Patriarch of the Qin Clan!\\nQin Changkong who was behind Qin Tieba also felt excited.Qin Changkong hadn\u2019t felt much resentment towards Qin Tian, moreover, he had also understood that if it weren\u2019t for Qin Tian, the Qin Clan wouldn\u2019t have become the second ranked Clan within Linshui City. However, the fact that caused Qin Changkong to feel extremely excited was the fact that if Qin Tian were to lose his position, then Qin Nan would become absolute garbage in Qin Changkong\u2019s eyes.Although Qin Nan had become a waste, Qin Changkong still thought that this enough. He wanted to take away Qin Nan\u2019s qualifications to even look up to himself for the rest of his life.However, at this moment, the sound of an explosion suddenly resounded.The gate of Qin Clan\u2019s Conference was instantly blown into pieces scattered throughout the sky. A figure emerged from within the sawdust, residue, smoke, and dust; his face was filled with overwhelming rage. This person was Qin Nan!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had never imagined that there would be anyone who would dare to destroy the gate to the Qin Clan\u2019s Hall of Conference.Following this, their expression turned ugly as their gazes shifted.The duo wanted to know just who had balls large enough to interrupt them during such a crucial moment and disturb their joyous occasion.However, as they carefully shifted their gaze to the perpetrator, they were both completely shocked.Not only were the father and son duo shocked, but the faces of all the people present were also petrified. They had never imagined that the person who had come crashing into the Hall of Conference during this crucial time would actually be the notorious waste of the Qin Clan, Qin Nan!\u201cAll of you want to impeach my father?\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s complexion was ice cold. He acted as if he didn\u2019t do anything wrong as he asked this question to the crowd.\u201cNan\u2019er, you\u2026.\u201d At this moment, Qin Tian was also speechless due to Qin Nan\u2019s actions. However, he quickly gathered his thoughts and his complexion changed as he said with a stern voice, \u201cQin Nan, what are you doing? You are not allowed in here, hurry up and\u2013\u201dBefore Qin Tian could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by Qin Tieba who emitted a faintly discernible killing intent and his expression turned cold as he said, \u201cQin Nan, you have quite the audacity. This is the Hall of Conference of he Qin Clan, yet you dare to destroy the gate and disturb this meeting. Are you planning to cause trouble?\\nQin Tieba suddenly raised his voice as he spoke. The majestic aura of a tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm Expert erupted while he attacked Qin Nan.From this, one could tell that Qin Nan\u2019s abrupt action had enraged Qin Tieba.If it wasn\u2019t for Qin Tian\u2019s cultivation level, there\u2019d be no doubt that Qin Tieba would directly kill Qin Nan.Qin Nan acted as though he hadn\u2019t noticed Qin Tieba\u2019s anger, instead, his eyes inspected the audience with his saber-like gaze. He said slowly, \u201cLet me ask once again. Are you people planning on impeaching my father\u2019s position?\u201dThe audience was as silent as before. They didn\u2019t know whether it was due to the fact that Qin Nan had suddenly charged in, or if there were other factors. The attendees were only able feel suffocated, unable to utter a single word.\u201cYou\u2014\u2014\u201d Qin Tieba\u2019s expression completely changed. He had never imagined that this little waste Qin Nan would actually completely ignore him. One had to understand that even Qin Tian would have to lower his head in front of Qin Tieba.What qualifications does a waste have to disregard me?At this point, Qin Tieba\u2019s animosity had only increased; his rage grew immensely. He clenched his fist, releasing a crackling sound.However, at this moment, Qin Changkong suddenly took a large stride and appeared before Qin Tieba. He raised his head with his gaze revealing disdain and ridicule towards Qin Nan and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right! We have come today in order to impeach your father and have him hand over the position of Patriarch.\u201dQin Nan\u2019s gaze paused at Qin Changkong, his face unfazed as he asked in an indifferent manner, \u201cWhy?\u201dWhen Qin Changkong saw Qin Nan\u2019s reaction, he couldn\u2019t help but to be slightly angry.One had to understand that Qin Changkong is a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit genius and a chosen disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect. On the contrary, Qin Nan was only a first-grade Huang Ranked Martial Spirit trash. Why didn\u2019t he revere Qin Changkong? Why should Qin Nan be able to talk in this manner?\u201d \\nQin Changkong was in a terrible mood and revealed out a malicious smile as he mocked, \u201cWhy? This was all because your father wanted to transfer five hundred Body Tempering Pills to a trash like you. As the Patriarch of the Qin Clan, he should be giving me the Body Tempering Pills to me, a soon-to-be disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect. Instead, he\u2019s giving it to you. Because of this, he no longer has any qualifications to be Patriarch. \u201c\u201cDisciple of Mystic Spirit Sect?\u201d Qin Nan was surprised.Qin Nan naturally knew of Mystic Spirit Sect. Not only did he know it, but entering the Mystic Spirit Sect and becoming their disciple was but one of Qin Nan\u2019s objectives. However, Qin Nan hadn\u2019t anticipated that Qin Changkong would actually become one of the chosen disciples for Mystic Spirit Sect.Qin Nan immediately understood why the Supreme Elder, Qin Tieba, would have the audacity to impeach his father.When Qin Changkong saw Qin Nan\u2019s reaction, he immediately gave a mocking smile. Great satisfaction rose from within his heart. What do you, Qin Nan, even account for? Now you should finally understand the level of difference between me, Qin Changkong, and you.\u201cQin Tian, if you don\u2019t tell your son leave, don\u2019t blame me for being impolite.\u201d At this moment, Qin Tieba\u2019s cold gaze was also fixed on Qin Tian.At the same time, the attendees had also came to their senses.\u201cShit, what is this waste doing here? He even had the audacity to destroy the gate of the Hall of Conference. He\u2019s simply courting death!\u201d\u201cA waste actually dares to come here and talk, how reckless!\u201d\u201cWe definitely must impeach Qin Tian. His son is clearly a waste but he dares to be this arrogant! If Qin Tian continues to be the Patriarch, then not even heavens would know what other things this waste would do!\u201d \\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s right! Impeaching Qin Tian is definitely the correct choice!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThese attendees were completely ruthless. The words that came out of their mouths were absolutely despicable.Qin Tian\u2019s face grew ugly. These people were humiliating his own son right in front of him. As a father, how could he not be angry? If this was in the past, Qin Tian wouldn\u2019t hesitate, but right now, the circumstances were very different.Qin Tian took a deep breath and silently endured, sorrow couldn\u2019t help but to rise from within his heart. His tone was filled with helplessness, \u201cNan\u2019er, you should step down. This isn\u2019t a place you should be in\u2026.\u201dHowever, before Qin Tian could finish his sentence, he was interrupted once again.He had just been interrupted by the Supreme Elder, Qin Tieba. However, this time, he was interrupted by Qin Nan.Qin Nan\u2019s expression was as incomparably calm as before. His gaze bore no expression whatsoever as he looked at Qin Tieba and Qin Changkong. He then spoke, \u201cThe reason as to why you\u2019re impeaching my father is because he\u2019s giving a waste five hundred Body Tempering Pills, am I correct?\u201d\u201cHaha. Indeed.\u201d Qin Changkong took the initiative to answer, his eyes were filled with arrogance and disdain, \u201cFor a waste like you, he would squander a full five hundred Body Tempering Pills. How is this something a Patriarch should be doing?\u201dOriginally, Qin Changkong didn\u2019t need to pay any attention to Qin Nan using his current background.However, as long as there was an opportunity to attack and ridicule the former number one genius, Qin Changkong would not let the chance go. This was because attacking and ridiculing Qin Nan gives Qin Changkong a strong sense of satisfaction.\u201cVery good.\u201d Qin Nan nodded his head. He was no longer looking at Qin Changkong, instead, he was looking at everyone present. Suddenly, Qin Nan raised his voice, it was as if a thunder struck down, \u201cIf I am not a waste, does that make the Patriarch transferring five hundred Body Tempering Pills to me acceptable? In that case, you would also no longer have the qualifications to impeach my father?\u201d \\nThe expressions of everyone present changed, including Qin Tian and Qin Tieba.An idea immediately came to mind. Just what was Qin Nan trying to accomplish? What exactly was he trying to prove? Prove that he was not a waste?As everyone was silent for a few moments, a loud laugh inhibiting ridicule resounded. The who let out this laugh was naturally Qin Changkong.\u201cHahaha, did I hear that incorrectly? Qin Nan, a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit waste like you would actually say that you aren\u2019t a waste?With the grade of your Martial Spirit, even if you had endless of Spiritual Medicine, you would stay a trash for the rest of your life!\u201dQin Changkong was incomparably delighted. As he finished saying this, he didn\u2019t forget to add in another sentence, \u201cOf course. If you really aren\u2019t a waste, then it\u2019d be acceptable for Qin Tian to transfer five hundred Body Tempering Pills to you. Additionally, we won\u2019t pursue this matter.\u201dAt this time, the words of Qin Changkong already have the aura of someone who has the title of \u2018number one\u2019.However, the crowd didn\u2019t mind this. After all, the current Qin Changkong is a chosen disciple of Mystic Spirit Sect. The differences between their background was immeasurable, that\u2019s why they also didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, everyone was actually looking at Qin Nan with interest.You, Qin Nan, would actually say that possessing a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit wouldn\u2019t count as being a waste? What exactly counts as being a waste then?Qin Tian\u2019s complexion changed, \u201cQin Nan, you\u2026.\u201dAlthough everyone present wanted to see Qin Nan being humiliated, however, Qin Tian thought otherwise. Currently, Qin Tian only have one idea. Since Qin Tian has gone out of control, then he needs to send Qin Nan off. If the matter were to get even more serious, then it\u2019d only serve as disadvantage to Qin Nan.\\nQin Nan acted as if he didn\u2019t hear the humiliation coming from the people, instead, he was looking at Qin Changkong indifferently as he said, \u201cVery good. Then let me ask you, just what do I have to do to prove that I am not a waste?\u201dQin Changkong was slightly shocked. He originally thought that Qin Nan would immediately cover his face and escape after being humiliated, but he had never thought that Qin Nan would become even more serious.However, Qin Changkong didn\u2019t take this to heart. With excessive sarcasm in his tone, he said, \u201cThat won\u2019t be easy. If your cultivation were to surpass me, then that would naturally count as\u2026\u201dAs the present crowd heard these words, each one of them glanced at Qin Nan with ridicule. Some of them couldn\u2019t control themselves and burst into a big laughter.What was Qin Changkong\u2019s current cultivation? It was at the third-layer of Body Tempering Realm!It had only been about half a month since the Martial Spirit Awakening Ceremony. By relying on Qin Nan\u2019s first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, even if he were to consume more Spiritual Medicine, he would still not be able to reach the third-layer of Body Tempering Realm.At this moment, the present everyone was a bit impatient as they wanted to see the scene of Qin Nan revealing his cultivation and lose face.However, before Qin Changkong finished saying his sentence, the present crowd saw Qin Nan suddenly wave his hand and interrupt Qin Changkong, \u201cI have already understood your intentions. You don\u2019t need to anything anymore because a waste like you simply does not have the qualifications to talk to me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.called me a waste?\u201d Qin Changkong expression instantly changed, followed by his face vigorously changing expressions once again. Immense rage surged from him, \u201cQin Nan, you sure have balls. Trash like you dares to call me a waste? Today, I will definitely beat you to \u2026\u201d\\nSuddenly, beneath the gaze of the present people, Qin Nan suddenly took a large stride. From his body, an unrestricted aura of a fourth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator erupted, its immense force tenaciously pressured Qin Changkong.Qin Changkong\u2019s complexion greatly changed in an instant; his body turned incomparably stiff. His throat felt as though it was being clutched by an incorporeal strength. He was unable to utter the final word of his sentence.As he revealed his own cultivation, Qin Nan\u2019s aura also abruptly changed. His aura pressured Qin Changkong as if it was a sharp and lofty saber.After he had finished talking, Qin Nan immediately turned around and faced the crowd. His aura was like a rainbow surging through the heavens, and pressuring the ground.\u201cNow, tell me, is Qin Changkong a waste?\u201dAt this moment, the Qin Clan\u2019s Hall of Conference sunk into complete silence; these words incessantly resounded in the ears of the crowd.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - One With the SaberPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15 \u2013 One With the SaberThe present attendees, Elders, even Qin Tian, Qin Tieba, and Qin Changkong all had their eyes wide open, with their astonished faces looking at Qin Nan. This was because they never expected the aura Qin Nan released to have achieved the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm stage! The fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm couldn\u2019t compare at all to some of the greater attendees and Elders.However, in the Canglan Continent one would have to go through the Martial Spirit Awakening before one could channel one\u2019s Martial Spirit to communicate with heavens and earth, and initiate cultivation. It had only been about half a month since the Martial Spirit Awakening, and Qin Nan had actually broken through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm?One had to understand that Qin Changkong possessed a fifth-grade, Huang ranked Martial Spirit, and he had only broken through the third-layer of Body Tempering Realm because of the large quantity of Spiritual Medicine. Qin Nan only possessed a first-grade Martial Spirit, so how could his cultivation speed be more frightening than Qin Changkong\u2019s?In that instant, the attendees and Elders subconsciously thought back to when they were ridiculing Qin Nan just now. They felt as though a palm had repeatedly slapped their faces, causing a painful ache. They were just ridiculing him and calling him a waste? Qin Nan at the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm stage was a waste? This caused them to think once more about what Qin Nan had said before. It was as if at this moment Qin Changkong, who was in front of Qin Nan, was actually the true waste.\u201cNan\u2019er\u2026.how did your cultivation break through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm?\u201d Qin Tian asked with a slight tremble in his voice.\u201cImpossible! A sharp voice suddenly resounded. Qin Tieba\u2019s eyes were bloodshot as he fixated on Qin Nan. He was like a hungry wolf, \u201cHow did you break through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm? Your Martial Spirit is only of first-grade Huang ranked trash. With a trash like that, how did you break through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm stage?\u201d\\nEveryone came to their senses from the shock, and each of them looked at Qin Nan with overwhelming surprise. This matter was simply too shocking. As everyone knew, the lower one\u2019s Martial Spirit was, the worse the cultivation speed, capability, and future potential. This was something that had been established since ancient times. How did Qin Nan break through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm with a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?Qin Nan completely disregarded Qin Tieba\u2019s gaze, as well as everyone else\u2019s.. Instead, he looked toward Qin Tian and cupped his hands, \u201cFather, I was at the Longhu Mountain Range a few days ago and had a fortuitous encounter that allowed me to break through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm stage. I was planning on reporting to you in the future.\u201d\u201cA fortuitous encounter?\u201d Qin Tian was shocked as he did not expect this. He immediately followed up with a hearty laugh as he clapped his hands, \u201cGood, good. That\u2019s really good.\u201dAt this time, the people present all came to a realisation at the same time. They looked at Qin Nan, eyes brimming with great jealousy. One had to understand that although the grade of Martial Spirit is indeed important, luck was also extremely important. As long as you can find a treasure that is an antiquity, then even if you were a waste, you could still increase your cultivation.Those present had no doubt about this. If it wasn\u2019t for a fortuitous encounter, then how could a waste like Qin Nan possibly break through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm? A short moment later, those staring at Qin Nan finally came back to their senses, and their hearts were full of disdain.So what if he had a fortuitous encounter? You, Qin Nan, are only a first-grade, Huang ranked Martial Spirit waste. As Qin Nan didn\u2019t understand the reason behind the people\u2019s gazes, his own eyes fell upon Qin Changkong as he said calmly, \u201cQin Changkong, I remember you said that as long as I proved I\u2019m not a waste, then you would no longer impeach the Patriarch. Although I may have relied on the fortuitous encounter to reach this point, my cultivation is still better than yours. Furthermore, in regard to cultivation, you are a waste in my eyes. How about that?\u201d\\nQin Tieba\u2019s face changed. Qin Changkong turned increasingly more angry. Being ridiculed by Qin Nan caused the rage in his heart to almost explode. However, he couldn\u2019t retort because he himself did say that as long as Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation was higher than his own, he would no longer be a waste. Additionally, receiving the five hundred Body Tempering Pills at that point would be more acceptable. Furthermore, even though Qin Nan was deliberately ridiculing Qin Changkong, in terms of cultivation, Qin Changkong definitely was not on par with Qin Nan.\u201cQin Nan, you\u2026.\u201d Qin Changkong gnashed his teeth. His face was gloomy; it was as though his expression was reflecting the weather, dripping rain and gloomy as he said, \u201cI did indeed say that before. As long as you can prove you are not a waste, then that is enough. However, I have had a change of mind. I challenge you to a battle! As long as you can win against me, then today we will not impeach and remove Qin Tian from the Patriarch position!\u201d\u201cQin Nan, don\u2019t!\u201d Qin Tian took the initiative to say before Qin Nan had opened his mouth. \u201cQin Changkong harbors a fifth-grade Martial Spirit. Even if you are at fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm level, you are still not equal with him. You have already done great today, and as a father, I\u2019m also satisfied. Not having the position as Patriarch is fine.\u201dAs Qin Tian said this, his face was calm. It was clear that after being through Qin Nan\u2019s commotion just now, Qin Tian\u2019s originally discouraged heart had returned.\u201cHahaha!\u2019 Qin Changkong\u2019s loud laugh resounded. His eyes turned red as he fixated on Qin nan, \u201cDid you hear that? Even your father doesn\u2019t want you to battle me. So what if you had a fortuitous encounter? So what if your cultivation is higher? You need to understand that you are the waste, and so is your entire family!\u201d\\nThe attendees in the surroundings slightly nodded their heads. If Qin Nan really did agree to battle Qin Changkong at this moment, then he really would be looking to die. Just as Qin Tian had said, even if the current Qin Nan had a higher cultivation level than Qin Changkong, he was still not on par with him. Qin Nan\u2019s eyes turned icy as he said, \u201cSince you\u2019re delivering yourself to me, then don\u2019t blame me for being impolite. Very good, you better remember your own promise. I agree to battle you!\u201dAs these words were spoken, everyone was dumbstruck, particularly Qin Tian whose face greatly changed. However, after the attendees, Elders, and Qin Tieba\u2019s shock passed, their faces immediately revealed ridicule. This Qin Nan was indeed arrogant and egotistical. He couldn\u2019t possibly think that having the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm would be enough to be on par with Qin Changkong! Qin Nan could not actually think that a fifth-grade, Huang ranked Martial Spirit was just there for decoration! That was simply courting death!\u201cHahaha! Qin Nan, it is you who have said that. Today, I\u2019ll let you see my high-tier Martial Skill!\u201d As he heard Qin Nan accepting, Qin Changkong couldn\u2019t contain his joy while completely disregarding the arrogance in Qin Nan\u2019s tone. He released the aura of his third-layer Body Tempering Realm, and five golden rays blossomed from the back of his body.\u2018Roar!\u2019A majestic beast roar exploded forth; a gigantic and ferocious white tiger figure slowly manifested behind Qin Changkong\u2019s back as it released the pressure of a fifth-grade, Huang ranked Martial Spirit. As Qin Changkong struck out, he immediately unleashed the full force by channeling his Martial Spirit.\u201cWhite Tiger Pouncing at Prey!\u201dQin Changkong\u2019s eyes revealed an ominous glint as he slowly took a stance. It was as though his body became a white tiger. The manifested white tiger behind his back mimicked his movements exactly. The lofty body of the tiger slowly stooped, its mouth revealing two fierce teeth that emanated a serene and cold ray. A man and a beast, it was as though the two were indistinguishable as they emanated an intense and tyrannical qi. As Qin Changkong struck out, those present immediately erupted. Their faces revealed a great shock.\\n\u201cIt turns out to be this high-tier Martial Skill. According to the legends, this high-tier Martial Skill is the hardest one to practice. Once you have mastered it, the man and Martial Spirit can synchronize with each other. Furthermore, Qin Changkong possessed the White Tiger Martial Spirit!\u201d\u201cThis Martial Skill is simply made for Qin Changkong!\u201d\u201cHe was able to comprehend this Martial Skill in just half a month. Possessing a fifth-grade, Huang ranked Martial Spirit is definitely of no small matter. Hahaha! At this rate, this waste Qin Nan will definitely be out of luck.\u201d\u201cHumph! Qin Nan is overestimating his own strength. Does he think that he can become number one in the world by just acquiring a fortuitous encounter?\u201d\u201cHahaha! Watch as the Young Master Qin Changkong teaches this waste a lesson.\u201dSuddenly, the present attendees turned passionate. As they looked at Qin Nan and Qin Tian, their eyes brimmed with joy for the disaster they expected to occur. They believed that it would only require one move for Qin Changkong\u2019s immense White Tiger to shred Qin Nan into pieces.Qin Tian\u2019s complexion was incomparably pale; his gaze was fixated on this scene. If something went wrong, he planned to use all his strength to intervene. No matter what happened, he couldn\u2019t just watch helplessly as Qin Nan suffered. Qin Nan\u2019s face remained the same as he slowly pulled out the Black Iron Saber from his waist.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to release your Martial Spirit?\u201d Qin Changkong licked his lips. It was as if he had turned into a hungry tiger, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t pull anything like a sneak attack. Although your Flame Saber is only at first-grade, Huang ranked Martial Spirit, it is still much stronger than the lousy Saber in your hand.\u201dIn Qin Changkong\u2019s mind, Qin Nan would undoubtedly lose. Thus, Qin Changkong was not in a hurry. His current objective was to unceasingly mock Qin Nan and wipe clean the humiliation he\u2019d received earlier. However, in this moment the words that came from Qin Nan enraged Qin Changkong so much that he almost spit blood.\\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to use my Martial Spirit against a trash like you,\u201d Qin Nan held his Saber and gave an indifferent smile. It was as if Qin Changkong was at the same level as an ant in his eyes.As the surrounding attendees heard this, they were all flabbergasted. Just how arrogant and egotistical was Qin Nan? He even dared to insult Qin Changkong!\u201cYou\u2026. you\u2026. You\u2019re courting death!\u201d Qin Changkong was so angry that his entire body trembled, and his face turned red from anger. As he bellowed this, he could no longer contain himself. Killing intent rose from his body, and his figure viciously pounced toward Qin Nan.As Qin Changkong\u2019s figure attacked, the White Tiger behind his body followed his movements. If one were to view this from a distance, it would look as if the human and beast had merged together. Brandishing its immense claw toward Qin Nan\u2019s figure, it looked ready to shred him apart. In this instant, the violent brandish caused a strong gale and the tiger\u2019s hiss shook the heavens.Qin Nan\u2019s body suddenly pulled back, his eyes turning incomparably sharp. He couldn\u2019t help but admit that the high-tier Martial Skill Qin Changkong was using could instantly kill a fourth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator\u2026 Even your average fifth-grade Body Tempering Realm cultivator was simply not his equal. However, in front of Qin Nan, that was far from enough!In an instant, Qin Nan\u2019s eyes suddenly shut tight. Within his heart was a mysterious feeling. The Black Iron Saber in Qin Nan\u2019s hands felt as though it had received a sort of attraction, and suddenly, his body began to tremble, letting out a buzzing sound. Beneath the killing move, White Tiger Pouncing at Prey, this sound was exceedingly weak. However, the attendees who were watching this battle were all at the fifth-layer of Body Tempering Realm, and they could immediately sense the noise.\\n\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Second Elder and Third Elder took a deep breath and said in astonishment, \u201cCould it possibly be the legendary \u2018One with the Saber\u2019?\u201dIn the moment when the two people\u2019s voices came out, Qin Nan had already struck out with his Saber. The Saber was aggressive and gracious, domineering and tyrannical. Following this was an explosion of sound like thunder. An ice cold aura suddenly surged throughout the Hall of Conference.\u201cThundercrash Saber Art!\u201dWhen the saber chopped out, there would be only death; no wound. The killing intent immediately surged.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He never expected the unremarkable Saber in Qin Nan\u2019s hands to actually emanate such a frightening power. At this point, he no longer had any room for regret.Beneath the eyes of the people present, a sharp saber light heavily struck the top of the immense White Tiger\u2019s head. The mighty and tyrannical White Tiger was forcibly shredded into pieces in an instant.\u201cAh!\u201dQin Changkong gave out a miserable shriek as his body was severed like the string on a kite. He was struck, flying straight into the wall. The result of this match was decided in just a single move.The entire Conference Hall sunk into a deadly silence, and the crowd widened their eyes. The scene just a moment ago felt like a dream; they were simply unable to come back to their senses.Qin Changkong actually lost? The number one genius of Qin Clan had actually lost?Qin Changkong, possessing a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, was actually unable to win against Qin Nan, who didn\u2019t even use his Martial Spirit?\u201cHow\u2026how is this possible?\u201d\u201cNan\u2019er, you\u2026\u201d Being the number one expert of Qin Clan, Qin Tian was the first to come back to his senses; his face revealed an astonishment and delight, \u201cYour Saber Art\u2026 Is that the middle-class Martial Skill, Thundercrash Sword Art? Hahaha! that\u2019s definitely my son. You have actually polished your Saber Art to this degree. Although it\u2019s not quite at the true \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 level, it has already touched upon the entrance of it.Qin Tian brushed off his previous attitude; his complexion was very florid. However, his words were like a sudden clap of thunder, once more being thrown into the Conference Hall and causing those present to be overwhelmed with shock. Qin Nan had actually used a middle-class Martial Skill!\\nHe used a middle-class Martial Skill, and knocked on the doors to the \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 stage. Not only that, but he had defeated Qin Changkong, who used a high-class Martial Skill and also possessed a fifth grade Martial Spirit! In this moment, the present attendees and Elders felt a painful scorching heat on their faces.They mocked Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit grade, claimed his cultivation was trash, but then they were slapped in the face by Qin Nan\u2019s fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm. However, just now, they ridiculed Qin Nan once more for accepting the duel request from Qin Changkong, assuming he was bringing about his own defeat, but once again, they were caught off guard by Qin Nan\u2019s shocking abilities. This caused the crowd to consider Qin Nan\u2019s past achievements.So what if it was only a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?A genius is a genius, it\u2019s impossible to suppress one\u2019s genius.In the next moment, they looked directly at Qin Nan. Their eyes were no longer shuttered with disdain. Although a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit is not destined to have any prospects in the future, and it\u2019s simply incomparable with Qin Changkong, the current Qin Nan emerged victorious. No matter what happened, he was the one who had claimed victory; thus, one could only respect him.\u201cYou\u2026. you\u2026.. You\u2026\u201d Qin Tieba stretched his hands out and pointed at Qin Nan with trembling fingers. He continuously repeated \u201cyou\u201d ten more times before a \u2018Pu\u2019 sound was heard. He was so angry that he started to cough blood.Originally, the matter of Qin Tian being replaced by Qin Tieba was already concluded, however, who would\u2019ve thought that Qin Nan would interrupt. How could Qin Tieba not be angry? However, no matter how angry he became, he could only hold it within his heart. This caused internal injuries to occur within him.\\n\u201cImpossible! How is this possible?\u201d a sharp voice resounded. Qin Changkong stood up with his face filled with rage as he frantically shouted, \u201cHow could a waste like you defeat me? I am the genius, you are only a waste!\u201d At this moment, Qin Changkong had finally gone crazy, as he talked without reason.How could Qin Changkong not go crazy after being defeated by an insignificant waste who possessed a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? Additionally, he didn\u2019t even use his Martial Spirit, whereas, Qin Changkong himself had used a high-class Martial Skill and his full strength.I, Qin Changkong should be the number one genius in Qin Clan!Qin Nan\u2019s face was expressionless. If one were to carefully look at him, one would notice a layer of meticulous cold sweat. As Qin Tian stated before, Qin Nan had only touched upon the entrance of \u2018One with the Saber Realm\u2019. The breath-taking chop that he used just now had already exceeded his physical capabilities.\u201cSay something!\u201d Qin Changkong continued to shriek, \u201cYou trash, say something!\u2026.\u201dAlthough Qin Nan\u2019s strength was exhausted, his eyes still remained the same as before; emanating a cold aura. \u201cQin Changkong, don\u2019t think your fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit is impressive. Let me tell you, there are People beyond People, and Heavens beyond Heavens. Thus, you shouldn\u2019t be overestimating yourself. Seeing how you are a disciple of the Qin Clan, I\u2019ll give you a word of advice\u2026 Today, you are not a match for me, and neither will you be in the future. Thus, don\u2019t look down on people with your dog-like eyes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Qin Changkong got so mad that his body began to tremble, his face turned purple, yet unexpectedly, he was unable to retort.The present attendees felt their faces scorch once more. It was as if the words Qin Nan said were directed toward them as well.\\n\u201cQin Nan, I will definitely not forget about this. Once a trash, always a trash. Today, you may have defeated me, but so what? In the future, I will be the disciple of Mystic Spirit Sect, whereas you will be nothing. Father, let us leave!\u201d as Qing Changkong got to this point, he felt the chill in Qin Nan\u2019s eyes. His heart suddenly shivered, and he no longer dared to say anything else as he dragged Qin Tieba to leave.If they were to stay any longer, then it\u2019d be bringing more disgrace on themselves. As the father and son left, the Conference Hall\u2019s atmosphere once again froze. At first, there were some attendees who wanted to seize that opportunity and slip away. After feeling Qin Nan\u2019s gaze on themselves, they could only endure it and stay.In actuality, they had no need to dread Qin Nan at all. That was because Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation was definitely not a match for them. Furthermore, Qin Nan\u2019s current strength was only temporarily stronger. At the end of the day, his Martial Spirit was only of a first-grade Huang rank It was simply not on par with Qin Changkong. However, because Qin Nan won over the Qin Changkong who stood at the peak in their heart, this caused their instinct to instigate fear.\u201cI would like to ask if the present people are still planning on impeaching my father? Is it still wrong if my dad gives me five hundred Body Tempering Pills?\u201d Qin Nan asked indifferently.As he asked this, the present attendees heads felt like rattle drums, \u201cHow is that possible? Patriarch Qin Tian is just assisting the genius of the Clan\u2026 How is that wrong?\u201d\u201cIn my opinion, giving five hundred Body Tempering Pills is still not enough, there should be a bit more.\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! Young Lord Qin Nan, you are the genius of our Qin Clan. Spending a few Body Tempering Pills on you is not a problem.\u201d\u201cThe Patriarch position of our Qin Clan can only be claimed by Patriarch Qin Tian!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThese attendees completely changed their attitude, filling it with flattery and sweet talk. Now that Qin Changkong and Qin Tieba were gone, they wouldn\u2019t dare to impeach Qin Tian\u2019s position in the clan. Qin Changkong would become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect, however, they wouldn\u2019t. If they were to continue impeaching at this point, then who knows what would happen if Qin Tian made his move.Qin Tian looked down at the others Within his eyes there was a trace of sorrow, as well as a bit of indifference. After going through this, Qin Tian was very clear on one thing. This crowd of people from the Qin Clan were just like the tall grass\u2026 Wherever it was more beneficial, they learned that direction. They had no loyalty whatsoever. In that instant, Qin Tian suddenly felt a bit dull.\u201cNan\u2019er, alright, let us leave,\u201d Qin Tian waved his hands and looked at Qin Nan with pride filling his gaze.\u201cFather, wait a moment. I still have a few things to say to the present attendees.\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s gaze was tranquil as he looked toward the present people. The people were slightly startled, followed by them appearing to listen attentively.\u201cYou are the attendees of the Qin Clan, and accordingly, you are also my seniors,\u201d Qin Nan said without emotions, \u201cHowever, after the matter that happened today, you are no longer seniors in my eyes.\u201dThe first words that came out of his mouth caused most of those present to have a great change to their faces. Qin Nan didn\u2019t seem to care about this. Instead, his tone was increasingly sharp, \u201cIn my eyes, you are just like a tall grass, going along with the flow of those with power. The stronger one side is, the more you lean toward it. You impeached my father\u2019s position as Patriarch while repeatedly saying it was because of my father giving me, a waste of a son, five hundred Body Tempering Pills carelessly.\u201d\\n\u201cHowever, what about the facts?\u201d\u201cWho was the reason behind the development of the Qin Clan? My father! If we exclude the contribution my father has made, then we can still count the immense work he put behind it. So what if he gave five hundred Body Tempering Pills to his son? What\u2019s more is that he even used his own salary to compensate for this action.\u201d\u201cCould it be that you people believe that the Patriarch shouldn\u2019t carry any personal feelings whatsoever?\u201dAs Qin Nan said this, a wrath began to surge within his eyes, \u201cHowever, your attitudes have severely disappointed me None of you seem to realize my father\u2019s effort, and none of you seem to understand the responsibility of a father. All you see is the matter of Qin Changkong being selected as a disciple for the Mystic Spirit Sect!\u201dEach and every word carried Qin Nan\u2019s immense anger. This was the reason as to why Qin Nan decided to stomp down the gates this time. The sacrifices Qin Tian had made for the Qin Clan was boundless. However, the result of that was a group of people attacking him. This kind of action really made people bitter.\u201cThis is all I want to say: whatever you choose when the times comes is up to you. I know that Qin Tieba will definitely not leave this matter as it stands, and neither will Qin Changkong. However, I have one more warning for you. After you\u2019ve made your decision, you better not regret it.\u201dAfter he finished, Qin Nan\u2019s complexion turned tranquil once again, no longer paying any attention to the gazes of the attendees. Together with Qin Tian, he walked out of the Conference Hall.The people within the Hall came back to their senses and looked at each other in dismay.\\n\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hovering behind them were their Martial Spirits, constantly absorbing the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth. These disciples had clearly not yet heard news of the events that had transpired in the Conference Hall.One disciple who wore a splendid robe on his body, and great pride on his face opened his mouth to say, \u201cEveryone, pause your cultivation. Do you guys know what happened in the Qin Clan\u2019s great Hall?\u201dAs the disciples said this, he immediately attracted the attention of the people present, and some promptly asked, \u201cBrother Qin Hai, what happened in the Qin Clan? Hurry up and tell me.\u201dThe other disciples were also waiting with curiosity filling their faces. Qin Hai, had awakened a fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, which is second only to Qin Changkong. Thus, it was common for him to receive news that the other disciples did not yet know.As Qin Hai felt the crowd\u2019s gaze on himself, his complexion turned increasingly proud. He directly tossed out some awe inspiring information, \u201cIn this Clan Meeting, Big Brother Qin Changkong is going to impeach the Patriarch position of Qin Tian!\u201dAs he said this, the everyone\u2019s faces revealed great astonishment.Qin Changkong is actually impeaching Qin Tian\u2019s position in the Clan? That is simply too amazing!However, soon enough, the disciples regained their senses and their faces simultaneously revealed excitement. None of them seemed angry about this turn of events.\u201cHahaha, impeaching Qin Tian is only right. That fella actually gave five hundred Body Tempering Pills to his waste of a son.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, why should a waste like Qin Nan enjoy the use of so many Elixirs?\u201d\u201cFor his waste of a son, he would actually dare to do something like this. He absolutely does not have the qualification to be the Patriarch anymore.\u201d\\n\u201cHaha, what Big Brother Qin Changkong is doing is only right.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAll of the present disciples started condemning Qin Tian. They were extremely envious and jealous when Qin Tian transferred five hundred Body Tempering Pills to Qin Nan a while ago, however, they dared not hinder Qin Tian. Now, what Qin Changkong was doing made them feel extremely satisfied.As Qin Hai sensed everyone\u2019s reaction to this, he felt exceedingly satisfied as he continued to shock them, \u201cQin Tian will definitely not maintain his current position. This is because Big Brother Qing Changkong has already been selected as a disciple for the Mystic Spirit Sect. In five days, the Mystic Spirit Sect comes to Linshui City, and will officially receive him.\u201dIn the next moment, everyone\u2019s emotions surged. Each and every one of the disciples eyes widened in shock. Qin Changkong has actually become one of the selected disciples for Mystic Spirit Sect? The present people fully understood what kind of existence the Mystic Spirit Sect maintained. This is because the Mystic Spirit Sect was their objective. Entering the Mystic Spirit Sect was their dream.A moment later, these disciples eyes held a great reverence toward Qin Changkong. Qin Changkong was no longer an existence they could surpass. Qin Hai laughed. Suddenly, he thought of something that caused his face to show disdain; he carried a sense of mocking as he said, \u201cWhen Qin Tian loses his position as the Clan Patriarch, then Qin Nan will be completely out of luck. Hahaha!\u201dAs he started to laugh, the other people followed suit, and began to laugh as well.What does the current Qin Nan count as? He was just a trash that possessed a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. If it wasn\u2019t for Qin Nan being the number one genius of the Linshui City once upon a time, as well as being Qin Tian\u2019s son, then they wouldn\u2019t give him a single bit of attention. \\nHowever, at this moment, a sudden figure rushed into the Martial Training Grounds and shouted frantically, \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s a been a big incident\u2026\u201dEveryone looked over to the figure at the same time, and Qin Hai was naturally one of them. With a clueless tone, Qin Hai asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did they impeach Qin Tian\u2019s position? Hahaha! We knew of this matter ages ago!\u201dOthers started laughing once more. As the people who came over heard the laughing, they promptly gasped and held their breath until their faces turned red. Eventually they said, \u201cThe most recent news states, Qin Nan trespassed in the Hall of Conference. He had a fortuitous encounter in the Longhu Mountain Range, causing his cultivation to break through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm! Qin Nan and Qin Changkong had a fight to determine who was superior, and in just a single move Qin Nan defeated Qin Changkong, who was using the strongest move of his Martial Spirit!\u201dBoom!As the disciples heard this, they felt as though their heads were exploding. A waste like Qin Nan had a fortuitous encounter and broke through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm? He only used a single move to defeat Qin Changkong when he was using his Martial Spirit\u2019s strongest move? How could a waste like Qin Nan be this frightening?\u201cThis\u2026..this\u2026.\u201d Qin Hai was shocked beyond belief. He could not utter a single word. He recalled his mocking from before, and began shivering.Not only him, but the other disciples also began to shiver. So what if Qin Nan only possessed a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? His cultivation had already reached the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm, and he only used a single move to defeat Qin Changkong who used his strongest move!How are these people comparable to the current Qin Nan? They definitely did not have any qualifications!\\nWhile the disciples on the Martial Training Ground were surprised by the abrupt news, the incident at the Hall of Conference also quickly spread to the inner circle of Qin Clan, and to the Linshui City. This time, everyone was completely dumbfounded.Qin Nan only used a single move to defeat Qin Changkong. This was actually the renowned waste, Qin Nan? However, most of these people quickly recovered their senses, and none of them put the matter in their own heart. After all, Qin Nan only possessed a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. His future achievements would definitely be exceedingly dull. This time, he might have had a fortuitous encounter, but will that happen the next time as well? Qin Changkong was a fifth-grade Huang ranked genius. Although Qin Changkong may have lost this time, his future would definitely be limitless and incomparable.\u2014\u2014\u2014At this moment, within a luxurious court in Qin Clan.\u201cI will kill him, I will definitely kill him!\u201d Qin Changkong\u2019s eyes turned red, his killing aura overflowed, \u201cThat trash actually defeated me. How? How?!\u201dQin Tieba looked into Qin Changkong\u2019s eyes, and shook his head. However, his heart was also incomparably angry. That was because Qin Nan completely ruined his plan. Not only did Qin Tieba not take over the position as the Patriarch, his son, Qin Changkong, was also defeated; thus, leaving behind a traumatic experience that would affect his growth.\u201cCalm down,\u201d Qin Tieba said as he restrained his anger. He whispered, \u201cFive days later, the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2019s Elder Bai Heng will come here. After Elder Bai Heng has officially taken you up as his disciple, we will finally be able to seek revenge for what happened today. We\u2019ll make Qin Nan and Qin Tian, the father and son, suffer.\u201d\u201cYes, once Elder Bai Heng is here, I\u2019ll definitely show them!\u201d Qin Changkong revealed a gaze reminiscent of a hungry wolf.\\n\u2014\u2014\u2014Meanwhile, on the other side of Linshui City, within the Fang Clan, in a private room.\u201cHow long before Elder Bai Heng comes here?\u201d asked a middle aged man. This man had a white tiger skin draped over himself, and his figure was lofty, emanating an indescribable pressure. He was the Patriarch of the Fang Clan, Fang Li.\u201cHe\u2019ll be here in three days,\u201d the youth in front of Fang Li laughed, \u201cElder Bai Heng told Qin Clan that it\u2019d be five days after. There\u2019s two days for us to take care of our matters.\u201dA radiance flashed through Fang Li\u2019s eyes, \u201cGood. I\u2019d like to see just how Qin Clan is going to survive this time.\u201dAs the youth heard this, his brows slightly creased followed by saying, \u201cFather, I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s the point of this plan. Just who are these Qin Clan people? The number one genius of Qin Clan, Qin Changkong, is trash in front of my eyes. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d fear him.\u201dThe youth was the son of Fang Li, the brother of Fang Xue, Fang Rulong. Fang Li slightly shook his head before saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. The disciples of Qin Clan, with a fifth-grade and fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, have potential. We want to completely clean out the entire Qin Clan and not leave anything behind.\u201d Fang Rulong was expressionless. One could tell by the blood-thirsty intent exuding from his eyes that he didn\u2019t take the words Fang Li said to heart.Fang Li suddenly remembered something and said, \u201cI heard that Qin Nan defeated Qin Changkong?\u201dAs he heard this, Fang Rulong sneered in disdain without saying anything. It was very evident that Qin Nan did not have the qualifications for Fang Rulong to comment. The former number one genius, Qin Nan, was a formidable rival in Fang Rulong\u2019s heart. However, the current Qin Nan was only an ant in Fang Rulong\u2019s eyes. A trash; nothing that he would fear.\\nFang Li also shook his head; it was as though he was rebuking himself for mentioning Qin Nan. He followed by asking, \u201cOh right, is there any news about your sister?\u201dFang Rulong shook his head and said nothing. His sister was not worthy of his caring.Fang Li snorted in discontent, \u201cThis Fang Xue is getting crazier and crazier. Alright, you may leave now. Go and cultivate. If you\u2019re lacking anything, come and find me.\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - Eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial SpiritPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18 \u2013 Eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial SpiritAfter leaving the Conference Hall, Qin Nan directly went to the Patriarch\u2019s courtyard with Qin Tian. The second they took a step into the courtyard, Tie San, who was waiting, immediately asked, \u201cBig Brother, how did the things go?\u201dQin Tian laughed and said, \u201cLittle San, I have given birth to a good son. If it wasn\u2019t for Qin Nan, then I wouldn\u2019t know what we could expect from today\u2019s events.\u201d Although Qin Tian had already thoroughly understood the matter, he could still only sigh when he thought back to it.Tie San finally relaxed, followed by his face turning red as he looked at Qin Nan. He felt a little embarrassed as he said, \u201cYoung Lord, I was just anxious before. I hope you don\u2019t take what I said into your heart.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Uncle San. I know you\u2019re doing this for my father.\u201d Qin Nan gave a faint smile. Qin Nan\u2019s attitude toward Tie San had always been respectful, thus, no matter how much Tie San insulted him, Qin Nan would not blame him.At this moment, Qin Tian suddenly recalled something and looked at Qin Nan with his face turning stern, \u201cNan\u2019er, although Qin Tieba and the rest didn\u2019t succeed this time, the situation is still not good. In five days, the Mystic Spirit Sect will come and officially accept Qin Changkong as a disciple. By then, I won\u2019t be able to preserve my position as Patriarch.\u201dQin Tian paused before he continued, \u201cYou offended them this time, so they definitely will not leave this matter alone. Instead of waiting for them to take their revenge, why don\u2019t you go pack up and we\u2019ll escape to a faraway land?\u201d As Tie San heard this, his face turned solemn, and he nodded. It was evident that he agreed with what Qin Tian said.\\nAlthough Qin Nan only needed half a month to break through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm, and had touched upon the entrance of the \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 realm, his Martial Spirit was still only of first-grade Huang rank. This was definitely not enough to become a disciple of Mystic Spirit Sect.A great sect like Mystic Spirit Sect prioritizes the grade of the Martial Spirit when they select disciples. Qin Nan didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of hesitation as he immediately shook his head, \u201cFather, I\u2019m not leaving. If I were to leave now, then I\u2019m afraid that I would never rest again without worry. Don\u2019t fear father, Uncle San\u2026 I have my owns plans so you don\u2019t need to be so concerned.\u201dAs Qin Tian and Tie San heard this, they glanced at each other wanting to say something, but ultimately decided not to. How could they not worry about the current situation? However, considering Qin Nan\u2019s personality, the two of them simultaneously shook their heads. Even if they were to further advise him, his decision would remain unchanged. Nonetheless, the reason why Qin Tian didn\u2019t further argue was because he had a feeling that his own son hid another formidable trump card. This was also because they knew Qin Nan wasn\u2019t a reckless person.Qin Nan looked at the two people and thought. He still hadn\u2019t informed them about the matter with Fang Rulong. Originally when Qin Nan heard from Tie San that Qin Tieba was planning on impeaching Qin Tian\u2019s position in the Clan, he was planning on releasing the Divine Battle Spirit, turn the tables around, and defeat Qin Changkong. However, after he heard that Qin Changkong had been selected as a disciple for the Mystic Spirit Sect, Qin Nan ultimately decided to restrain himself and not release the Divine Battle Spirit. This was because of Fang Clan\u2019s Fang Rulong.\\nThe Fang Clan hadn\u2019t publicly released the fact that Fang Rulong had awakened a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. This made Qin Nan question the reason behind it. Based on this suspicion, Qin Nan had a faint feeling that Fang Clan would make a big move during the selection of disciples five days later.He didn\u2019t want to let Qin Tian and Tie San know of this because he did not want them to have too many worries. Furthermore, even if Fang Clan had some kind of conspiracy, it still wasn\u2019t a problem for Qin Nan. This was because Qin Nan\u2019s trump card was the Divine Battle Spirit, which had reached the seventh-grade Huang ranks. Just like what Qin Nan had said to Fang Xue in the past, he was not afraid of Fang Rulong at all.As he thought to this point, Qin Nan\u2019s heart regained its calm. After bidding farewell to Qin Tian and Tie San, he returned to his own courtyard. On the way back to his own courtyard, Qin Nan encountered something rather interesting. The servants of the Clan, as well as the disciples who had previously looked at him in disdain, were taking the initiative to greet him.Qin Nan laughed to himself. It seemed like the incident tin the Conference Hall had already spread to these servants and disciples. However, Qin Nan ignored them. These were the same people who sneered and ridiculed him in the past. Thus, trying to repent for it now was simply too late.After he returned to his courtyard, Qin Nan quickly went inside his house and brought out several jade bottles, withdrawing the Body Tempering Pills from within them. The Spiritual Qi emanating from these pills in a pile was extremely dense.\u201cI wonder what level the Divine Battle Spirit can reach with these five hundred Body Tempering Pills!\u201d\\nQin Nan took a deep breath; his face revealed excitement. If one were to go by the previous condition, ten Body Tempering Pills was enough to increase the grade of the Divine Battle Spirit by one. In that case, wouldn\u2019t five hundred Body Tempering Pills make the Divine Battle Spirit rise to the legendary Tian rank? Naturally, Qin Nan knew that this idea was a bit too exaggerative. As long as he could raise it to the Xuan ranked Martial Spirit, he would be satisfied.Qin Nan collected his thoughts and sat cross legged as seven golden rays began to dazzle. The Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s avatar appeared behind his back, standing tall in the air, its aura as domineering as before. As he released the Divine Battle Spirit, Qin Nan immediately reached out with his arm and swallowed the Body Tempering Pills. As the Body Tempering Pills entered Qin Nan, the Divine Battle Spirit began to release an incorporeal attraction, just like the last time, causing the Elixir to be thoroughly absorbed.One pill\u2026.four pills\u2026..seven pills\u2026.nine pills\u2026.As he picked up the tenth Body Tempering Pill, Qin Nan became a little nervous. He swallowed it, and carefully observed the changes to the Divine Battle Spirit.One breath\u2026.thirty breaths later\u2026After waiting for a long time, Qin Nan felt slightly disappointed, and his face had a bitter smile. This certainly wasn\u2019t as easy as he thought. The Divine Battle Spirit didn\u2019t increase in grade, even after swallowing ten Body Tempering Pills.\u201cLet\u2019s try again. Let\u2019s see how many I need!\u201dQin Nan quickly regained his calm. With full confidence, he began to toss the Body Tempering Pills into his mouth one after another. However, the results this time made Qin Nan\u2019s heart hit rock bottom.Thirty pills!Eighty pills!One hundred seventy pills!\\nThree hundred fifty pills!Qin Nan continuously swallowed until he reached four hundred and ninety pills, but the Divine Battle Spirit behind his back remained inactive. The potency of these Body Tempering Pills was like a drop of water falling into a great sea, disappearing within the Divine Battle Spirit.\u201cIt seems like\u2026 it\u2019s not that easy after all,\u201d Qin Nan wore an increasingly sour smile, however, he quickly readjusted his attitude. Having the ability to raise a grade by relying on Elixirs was already opposing the heavens. There was no reason to make an even more extravagant demand.\u201cHere\u2019s the last ten pills. Let\u2019s swallow them at same time. Let\u2019s see if I can raise the grade or not!\u201dQin Nan gritted his teeth and grabbed the remaining Body Tempering Pills, swallowing them all at once. He was not disappointed this time.After the Divine Battle Spirit had absorbed the potency of the ten Body Tempering Pills, its entire being suddenly trembled. Following this, a golden ray radiated from the top of the Divine Battle Spirit. This caused the Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s aura to suddenly turn even more formidable and tyrannical.The Divine Battle Spirit had finally broken through to the eighth-grade after consuming five hundred Body Tempering Pills! However, it was far more complicated than that. As Qin Nan felt delighted, the outline of of the lofty and fuzzy avatar of the Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s eyes slowly became clearer compared to the rest its body. It was as though this fuzzy Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s eyes were opening.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dQin Nan was greatly astonished. He could clearly sense when the Divine Battle Spirit changed, and his own eyes also changed. Originally, when Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation had reached the fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm, his eyesight had gotten exceedingly good. However, he could feel that his current eyesight was even better by tenfold.\\nAs Qin Nan looked around him, the grass and trees within the circumference of ten Mi was incredibly clear. Even the muddy water was perceivable.\u201cMy eyesight has actually improved?\u201dA thought came from Qin Nan\u2019s mind, and he thought back to the sudden changes to the Divine Battle Spirit. His heart was shocked once more. As the eyes of Divine Battle Spirit unveiled, a great change also occurred to his own eyes. Could this mean that the Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s development also influenced Qin Nan\u2019s corporeal body, and brought along other benefits?\u201cNot only could it increase ranks from consuming Elixirs, but I also felt my perception improve last time. I was afraid that had something to do with the Divine Battle Spirit. Now I know that it can actually influence the corporeal body\u2026 This Divine Battle Spirit is simply too frightening!\u201dQin Nan took a series of cold breaths. He was completely incapable of holding back his surging emotions. However, at this moment a thought came to Qin Nan\u2019s mind: I wonder what level I can reach in this lifetime with the help of this frightening Divine Battle Spirit?In this instant, Qin Nan began to feel that he knew too little. Within his world, a Martial King was already the strongest existence he could think of. He had never met or heard of anyone above the Martial King Realm, thus, he wasn\u2019t too certain about it.\u201cDivine Battle Spirit, there are none it does not fight, and there are none it does not win against\u2026.\u201d Qin Nan suddenly recalled the words in his mind and muttered to himself. Only after a little while did he suddenly realize that his eyes emanated a radiance, \u201cSince I possess a Martial Spirit this formidable, I wonder how I should choose my future? I should enter the Mystic Spirit Sect. By entering the sect I can truly understand this world and tread upon an even broader world\u2026and then defeat all the enemies!\u201d\\nIn this short moment, Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Heart followed the changes of the Divine Battle Spirit, turning incomparably solemn.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This news undoubtedly made the disciples of Qin Clan and Fang Clan boil with excitement. Everyone one of them began to wake up early and go to sleep late, putting their utmost effort into cultivation in hopes that their cultivation level would increase once more by the time the Mystic Spirit Sect arrived. Not only that, even the upper echelon of Qin Clan and Fang Clan was nervously preparing for something. However, none of this had anything to do with Qin Nan.Ever since Qin Nan awakened his eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, he had been exceedingly diligent, entering a dull and tedious cultivation. During the three days and three nights he cultivated, Qin Nan did not move in the slightest. It was as if he turned crazy. The Spiritual Qi turned into a large serpent of condensed essence that was continuously moving throughout Qin Nan\u2019s body, whilst letting oppressive explosive sounds loose. It was like there was a mass of force quietly erupting within his body.After going through three days and three nights of cultivation, Qin Nan\u2019s current aura had become incomparably sharp due to the support of the eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. His aura radiated all around him to the point where it showed indistinct signs of coagulation. Suddenly, Qin Nan opened his eyes; in them showed a mysterious radiance.\u201cThe fourth-layer of Body Tempering Realm is to refine the viscera. Allowing one\u2019s own viscera to turn increasingly more resilient and pliable.\u201d\u201cIn that case, the fifth-layer of Body Tempering Realm should cause the skin, flesh, muscle, bones and viscera to improve to yet another level, and become even stronger.\u201d\\n\u201cIf I could reach the fifth-layer of Body Tempering Realm, then I could definitely be invulnerable. Fire and water would not be able to approach me!\u201dIn this moment, the many questions within Qin Nan\u2019s mind slowly dissipated; everything became clear to him. Naturally, thecause of his ease in understanding this concept was his increase to the eighth-grade Divine Battle Spirit, as well as Qin Nan\u2019s insane three day, and three night meditation. This is what it means to be prepared, so the success can come smoothly after.\u201cNow, let\u2019s break through the fifth-layer of Body Tempering Realm in a go!\u201dQin Nan shouted in a deep voice. His entire body\u2019s energy abruptly surged, and a powerful attraction force also erupted from the Divine Battle Spirit behind his back. Within this instant, Qin Nan\u2019s body had become like a gigantic vortex, absorbing the Spiritual Qi from all directions into his own body. As the majestic Spiritual Qi scoured him, Qin Nan\u2019s corporeal body couldn\u2019t help but to tremble a bit.Boom!A series of explosions continuously came from Qin Nan\u2019s body. He gritted his teeth as he endured the pain that came from the excessive amount of Spiritual Qi washing through his body. His eyes turned scarlet red, as though he was an angry wild beast. He refused to yield and said nothing, not even a single word came from his mouth.Two hours\u2026 Four hours\u2026. Eight hours\u2026After ten hours, Qin Nan\u2019s body suddenly trembled once more. The pain within his body was like a tide, completely dissipating, and in its place was an exceedingly majestic power surging around him.\u201cThis is\u2026the fifth-layer of Body Tempering Realm!\u201dQin Nan stood up with his face showing delight. He couldn\u2019t help but to clench his fist and feel the surging power within himself. If one were to say the fourth-layer of Body Tempering is just a small transformation within the Body Tempering Realm, then the fifth-layer of Body Tempering was on a whole different level. This level not only strengthened one\u2019s physique, but also the strength and perception stepped into a whole different level. Without exaggerating, one could say that if Qin Nan were to meet Qin Changkong now, he would only need to use half of his strength to thoroughly defeat him.\\n\u201cNan\u2019er,\u201d In this moment, Qin Tian entered and met eyes with Qin Nan, his face filled with joy, and he couldn\u2019t help but to say, \u201cDid something good happen?\u201dFollowing behind Qin Tian was Tie San, who was also slightly suspicious as he observed Qin Nan with a glance. Although it did seem like Qin Nan was different from before, he just couldn\u2019t tell how exactly. Suddenly, Tie San came to a realization, and said with a great shock, \u201cYou\u2019ve broken through the fifth-layer of Body Tempering stage?\u201dAs Qin Tian heard this, he also took a glance at Qin Nan to observe him. After doing a careful examination of Qin Nan, even Qin Tian, the one known as the number one expert of Qin Clan, was thoroughly astonished. Qin Nan\u2026 He really broke through to the fifth-layer of Body Tempering stage!It was only half a month ago since the Martial Spirit Awakening ceremony. Breaking through the fourth-layer of Body Tempering stage within this period of time was overwhelming, but now he had even broken through to the fifth-layer of Body Tempering stage? This was simply too frightening.Seeing the two people\u2019s expression, Qin Nan immediately started explaining, \u201cFather, Uncle San, the fortuitous encounter that I had in the Longhu Mountain Range was actually a Spiritual Medicine of heaven and earth. I hadn\u2019t finished refining it when I had broken through to the fourth-layer of Body Tempering stage. I was relying on the leftover potency of it to breakthrough to the fifth-layer of Body Tempering stage.After Qin Tian and Tie San heard this explanation, their faces promptly eased, without leaving behind any suspicion. If it wasn\u2019t for this Spiritual Medicine of Heaven and Earth, then the two of them would not believe in this kind of frightening speed of advancement. After all, Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit was only of a trifling first-grade Huang rank. As they thought to this point, Qin Tian and Tie San had some envy for Qin Nan\u2019s luck. A Spiritual Medicine of Heaven and Earth that allowed someone to breakthrough to the fifth-layer of Body Tempering stage in just half a month could be considered exceptionally precious, and something exceedingly rare to come by.\\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Father, Uncle San, is there a reason you\u2019re looking for me today?\u201d Qin Nan changed the topic with his question.Qin Tian slapped his head and remembered what he had come here for. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh and curse himself, \u201cOf course there is a reason. Tomorrow is the day when the Mystic Spirit Sect Disciple Recruiting Ceremony occurs. Everyone in the Qin Clan and Fang Clan are nearly busy to the point of craziness. You\u2019re the only person who is hiding in your courtyard, cultivating as if it is completely irrelevant to you.\u201dTie San, who was beside him, also smiled as he added, \u201cYoung Lord Qin Nan, the reason as to why the Patriarch and I came today is to ask you whether or not you are planning on participating in the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2019s Disciple Recruiting Ceremony?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m participating. Of course I am participating,\u201d Qin Nan said without the slightest hesitation, \u201cFather, Uncle San, you have no need to worry right now. Even if I wasn\u2019t selected to become one of the disciples for the Mystic Spirit Sect, no one within the youth generation would be able to injure me thanks to my current cultivation level.\u201dAs Qin Tian and Tie San heard this, they both nodded their heads. A fifth-grade Huang ranked cultivation is a peak existence within both Qin Clan and Fang Clan, and no one in the youth generation could match it. If one focused solely on the cultivation, then no one was on par with Qin Nan.As Qin Tian digressed the concern in his heart he said, \u201cThe Mystic Spirit Sect\u2019s Disciple Recruiting Ceremony this time is a joint meeting between Qin Clan and Fang Clan. It will be divided into two rounds. The first round is for the Fang Clan and Qin Clan to select thirty disciples, have them draw lots, and fight each other. The top five winners will be allowed to participate in the second round. The second round is just as you have guessed; it is to release your Martial Spirit, and analyze the Martial Spirit\u2019s grade. As for how many they will select, this is something the people in Mystic Spirit Sect have not revealed.\u201d\\n\u201cIs that so\u2026.\u201d Qin Tian nodded his head. Suddenly, something came to mind and he asked, \u201cWhere will this ceremony be located?\u201d\u201cThe location will be at Fang Clan,\u201d Qin Tian said indifferently.Qin Tian couldn\u2019t help but crease his eyebrows.The Disciple Recruiting Ceremony will be held in Fang Clan\u2019s grounds. Although there wasn\u2019t a specific reason, exactly, the matter of Fang Rulong being within Fang Clan caused Qin Nan to feel increasingly more certain of the fact that Fang Clan was conspiring something. They\u2019re most likely planning on using the Disciple Recruiting Ceremony this time to deal with Qin Clan. As Qin Nan understood one of their reasons, his heart began to feel calm; there was not the slightest bit of concern, thus, he didn\u2019t say anything to warn Qin Tian and Tie San.\u201cOh right. Qin Nan, I heard from the Patriarch that the art you used to defeat Qin Changkong was the Thundercrash Saber Art?\u201d Tie San, to the side of Qin Tian, suddenly asked.\u201cYes, Uncle San,\u201d Qin Nan answered.\u201cThat\u2019s great! It just so happens that I also cultivate the Thundercrash Saber Art, and I have quite a bit of comprehension within it. I\u2019ll let Young Lord observe this, and I hope it can be of help to you,\u201d Tie San laughed and extracted an antique book from his bosom.Qin Nan was shocked at what he heard. He never realized Tie San also cultivated the Thundercrash Saber Art.\u201cYou little fella, hurry up and accept it. Uncle San has immersed himself in the Thundercrash Saber Art for several years. He has even achieved the realm of \u2018One with the Saber\u2019. Now, your Uncle San is imparting his comprehension on you, and that\u2019s a very big advantage for you,\u201d Qin Tian said.\u201cOne with the Saber?\u201d The shock in Qin Nan\u2019s face increased, but he did not argue against receiving this aid. Instead, he directly accepted the antique book, and bowed to Tie San with a serious voice, \u201cThank you Uncle San, for your generosity. I, Qin Nan, really can\u2019t thank you enough!\u201d\\nWithin the Martial World, the comprehension a Martial Artist had toward a Martial Skill was exceedingly precious, so one could imagine the value of the written experiences of it. Due to these experiences, one\u2019s Martial Skill could become increasingly more profound, and even tread upon a much higher realm. Thus, this gift that Tie San presented Qin Nan was really quite precious.Tie San didn\u2019t oppose this action either. Instead he said, \u201cYoung Lord, your Martial Skill talent has always exceeded mine. Within this city, no one is on par with you. Luckily, you are suitable for the records of my cultivation. There\u2019s one more day before the start of the Mystic Spirit Disciple Recruiting Ceremony. I will stay here, so if you have any puzzling questions, don\u2019t be afraid to ask me.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 good!\u201d Although he did hesitate a bit, Qin Nan immediately promised and thanked him.Tie San personally came forth to give guidance, and this was his good will. He wished for Qin Nan to become even stronger during the Disciple Recruiting Ceremony. Qin Nan just had to accept this good will.\u201cFather, Uncle San, I will leave you alone now,\u201d Qin Nan gave his goodband then immediately went to the big rock within his courtyard, and began to concentrate on flipping through the antique book. He looked completely obsessed with it.Qin Nan had always been extremely interested in Martial Skills, so this interest was even greater than his interest in cultivation. As Qin Tian and Tie San saw this scene, they gave each other a glance. Their eyes carried a little helplessness, but mostly satisfaction. So what if Qin Nan only possessed a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? Qin Nan had the will and perseverance to grow stronger. This trait was already incredibly precious; it made people feel a sense of satisfaction.\\nFollowing this, Qin Nan completely immersed himself within the antique book. Just like what Qin Tian had said, Tie San had at least achieved the \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 realm. The comprehension within it made Qin Nan\u2019s eyes shine, and gave him a feeling of hope. Tie San stood in the middle of the courtyard, and occasionally looked toward Qin Nan. His heart felt increasingly satisfied. During this time, a thought suddenly appeared in Tie San\u2019s mind: How much can Qin Nan comprehend within the time frame of a single day?Following this, Tie San laughed involuntarily. Although Qin Nan\u2019s innate talent for Martial Skill was great, to make progress within a single day was simply impossible. As the time slowly passed, Qin Nan was still completely immersed in the antique book. After six hours had passed by, the color of the sky suddenly changed. An endless amount of black cloud came together, causing the sky to turn completely pitch. Within this sky, a faint muffled thunder resounded. Following this, the sky opened up like a sluice gate, and an endless amount of rainwater poured down instantly with a boundless vigor.\u201cBloody hell, how can this weather change like this\u2026\u201d Tie San couldn\u2019t help but to let out some curses, but he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. He promptly turned toward Qin Nan and yelled, \u201cQin Nan, Qin Nan\u2026.\u201dEven if Tie San didn\u2019t disturb Qin Nan, with this thunderstorm \u2013 the thunder, the rain and everything else would interfere in his training. To people who are in the midst of an awakening, not only is it undesired but may even bring harm. As Tie San yelled, his gaze subconsciously looked toward Qin Nan. Under these circumstances, Tie San, as if struck by lightning, threw the resonating sounds of the sky\u2019s pouring rain and thrashing thunder to the back of his head.\\nAll that he could see was the rain pouring from the sky, hitting on the ground, and hearing the pitter-patter sounds that it made, splashing everywhere. Qin Nan, holding the ancient archive, started flipping through the book page by page. As if he entered a magical trance, he paid no heed towards his surroundings. It seemed as though an invisible barrier had been put up, and the pouring rain was stopped abruptly ten inches from where Qin Nan sat, deflected by an invisible shield. Ten inches around Qin Nan\u2019s body seemingly had turned into a piece of sacred land, which neither water nor fire could enter. However, Tie San, who had several decades of experience in thunder sword arts, understood this very well. It was no invisible barrier, it was\u2026 Saber Intent!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - The Start of the AssessmentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20 \u2013 The Start of the AssessmentFor someone who has cultivated the Thundercrash Saber Art for several years, and completely comprehended the realm of \u2018One with the Saber\u2019, one could say Tie San was extremely familiar with Saber Intent. One could only grasp this kind of Saber Intent once they had comprehended \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 to a certain depth, and achieved the \u2018Greater Success Realm\u2019.Qin Nan had only just taken a step into the \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 realm, and he achieved this kind of level in just a single day?Just how frightening was Qin Nan\u2019s comprehension level?Tie San took a deep breath and looked Qin Nan in the eyes, but this time, he didn\u2019t call for Qin Nan.With the Saber Intent protecting one\u2019s body, the rainwater could not touch him. Additionally, the thunder sounds surrounding him also functioned as protection. It was simply impossible to disturb Qin Nan, who was in a profound state.If Young Lord Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit was of higher grade, then to what degree would his achievements reach?Tie San thought to himself about Qin Nan only possessing a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, and he couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Although Qin Nan has an impressive innate Martial Skill talent, his Martial Spirit grade was simply too low. On the Canglan Continent, that could only mean his achievement wouldn\u2019t be very good.As the time quickly flowed by, the rain continuously poured down and the thunder sounded incessantly. However, at this time within Qin Nan\u2019s courtyard, there were no sounds of raindrops, nor thunder. Instead, a buzzing noise resounded. This sound came from the Saber Intent surrounding Qin Nan\u2019s body. It was like a Saber, trembling at an unimaginable speed. The Saber Intent surrounding Qin Nan\u2019s body was becoming increasingly dense and powerful.\\nAfter fourteen hours, the sound of a \u2018thump\u2019 exploded forth. The Saber Intent enveloping Qin Nan\u2019s body began dispersing and he awakened from his frenzied state.\u201cThe sky is almost bright\u2026\u201dQin Nan subconsciously raised his head and realized the sky was getting brighter. He couldn\u2019t help but feel shocked; it seemed like he had been so immersed in the ancient book that he didn\u2019t notice the amount of time he had invested in its reading. After that, Qin Nan revealed a satisfied smile. The harvest he received in the last fourteen hours was no small matter.\u201cCongratulations Young Lord, for grasping the Saber Intent, \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 and achieving the Greater Success Stage.\u201d At that moment, Tie San walked out from the house, his face full of smiles.\u201cThis was all thanks to Uncle San\u2019s help,\u201d Qin Nan immediately showed his gratitude. If it wasn\u2019t for Uncle San\u2019s cultivation records, he would not have been able to achieve this level within such a short time.Tie San shook his head, \u201cYoung Lord, don\u2019t be modest. It\u2019s just your innate talent being exceedingly formidable.\u201dQin Nan ignored this and asked in curiosity, \u201cOh right, Uncle San, what is this \u2018Greater Success Stage\u2019 of the \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 realm you just mentioned?\u201dTie San\u2019s face turned solemn and he said, \u201cYoung Lord, before I answer this question, I\u2019d like to ask you if you have the feeling that your current Saber Art has completely exceeded the power which the Thundercrash Saber Art should originally have?\u201dQin Nan was shocked, but quickly followed with a nod. There was indeed this feeling. Thundercrash Saber Art was merely a middle-class Martial Skill within the Qin Clan. Qin Nan could use \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 and burst forth with Saber Intent. If the opponent were to use a high-class Martial Skill, or even a supreme-class Martial Skill, they would not be on par with him. \\nTie San continued, \u201cAs everyone knows, Martial Skills are divided into low-class, middle-class, high-class, and supreme-class. The higher the class of Martial Skill, the stronger its power will be. However, that\u2019s not exactly correct. If one were to solely view the Martial Skill, then it\u2019s indeed correct that the higher class it is, the stronger its power will be.\u201d\u201cHowever, once you\u2019ve reached another level with the Martial Skill, for example the \u2018One with the Saber\u2019, then one can no longer use its class to determine its power. In this case, it\u2019d be what realm it\u2019s in.\u201d\u201cRealm?\u201d Qin Nan felt like he understood this a little.Tie San nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. The higher the realm you are in, the stronger your power will be. For example, other than \u2018One with the Saber\u2019, there are also others with \u2018One with the Sword,\u2019 and so on. They are called, \u2018One with the Weapons\u2019. This is the first realm, and it is divided into: Foundation, Greater Success, and Perfection. After the \u2018One with the Weapons,\u2019 there\u2019s an even higher realm called \u2018Minute Subtlety\u2019. After that, there\u2019s even higher Martial realms, however, I do not know the details on this subject.\u2018Above \u2018One with the Weapons\u2019 is \u2018Minute Subtlety\u2019\u2026. I see.\u201dQin Nan came to a sudden realization, and now thoroughly understood. For example, Martial Skill would only be a temporary expedient. As long as one could grasp the realm, and depending on how much one grasped, then the power one could unleash would be even greater than normal. Qin Nan\u2019s current proficiency in Thundercrash Saber Art was so high that one could no longer describe the art as a middle-class Martial Skill. At this point, one could only use the terms \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 and \u2018Greater Success Stage\u2019 to describe its level. \\n\u201cYoung Lord, since the sky is not bright yet, should we start moving now so we can join the people of the Qin Clan and head toward the Fang Clan to participate in the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2019s Disciple Recruiting Ceremony?\u201d Tie San couldn\u2019t help but remind him as he saw Qin Nan beginning to ponder.Qin Nan came back to his senses and realized that, despite the sky not even being bright yet, the Qin Clan was still bustling with noise and excitement. Hearing this, he nodded his head. Tie San and Qin Nan walked toward the Martial Training Ground of the Qin Clan.On the lively Martial Training Ground, Qin Tieba sat on the premier seat with his face radiating, his complexion rosy. Behind him was the Second Elder and Third Elder, as well as the other attendees of the Qin Clan, while on the other side was Qin Tian. However, there was no one behind him at all. He was standing there by himself, thus, the differences were very clear. The disciples beneath them were all led by Qin Changkong.The current Qin Changkong was like the former him, his face filled with pride and his body emanated an aura that was unexpectedly a level more formidable than one of a third-layer of the Body Tempering stage. It was clear that he had used even more cultivation resources in the past few days. When Tie San and Qin Nan entered the Martial Training Grounds, the original passionate atmosphere suddenly calmed down. It was as if someone had poured a bucket of water onto a fire.All eyes within the crowd immediately turned to watch them enter. The first to look over was naturally Qin Tieba and Qin Changkong. The father and son\u2019s expressions were brimming with resentment and killing intent. There was also a trace of impatience- this was because the father and son had already decided that they would take revenge during the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2019s Disciple Recruiting Ceremony. The other gazes belonged to the elders and attendees of Qin Clan. \\nNot long ago in the Hall of Conference, after Qin Nan defeated Qin Changkong, he also reprimanded the crowd of elders and attendees. However, after seeing the current circumstances, it seemed like Qin Nan\u2019s words at that time hadn\u2019t had any effect whatsoever. The elders and attendees looked at Qin Nan with despise in their eyes, and it was clear that they did not take him seriously at all.You, Qin Nan, are still saying to not regret it? That is simply ridiculous. Following you, Qin Nan, Qin Tian would be regretful.The remains were naturally the disciples of the Qin Clan. These disciples\u2019 gazes were more honest, and there was neither ridicule, nor derision. That was because Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation was much higher than theirs, so they simply did not have the confidence to face him. However, among the crowd of disciples were also a few individuals who wore a look of disdain. Some even went out of their way to ridicule Qin Nan in a low voice. The most excessive one among them was the genius of Qin Clan, Qin Hai.Qin Nan\u2019s face was expressionless. He had already taken note of the situation when he first entered the Martial Training Grounds. Although his heart felt a slight disappointment towards the crowd, he still quickly calmed himself down. He did not even give a glance at the elders, attendees, and disciples. Only after Qin Nan and Tie San stood behind Qin Tian did the deathly still Martial Training Ground become a bit more noisy.In this moment, Qin Tian opened his mouth with a bustling aura, \u201cGood! Everyone should understand the rules right? In that case, I won\u2019t be saying anymore about it. Since everyone has arrived, then we should depart to the Fang Clan.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Tian waved his hand and motioned for Qin Nan and Tie San to go with him. Behind him was Qin Tieba, and his company, who quickly followed. Following Qin Tieba were the forces of the Qin Clan, who were all proceeding toward the Fang Clan. \\nA while after following Qin Tian, Qin Nan saw a vast red wooden gate not too far away. Above this great gate was a golden tablet. On the golden tablet were two characters that said \u2018Fang Clan\u2019. The calligraphic style was vigorous and incomparably bold. Outside of the great gate were five rows of servants. These servants were all wearing red robes, and all seemed to be full of joy.After seeing the Qin Clan\u2019s crowd, a servant among them, with the third-layer of the Body Tempering stage, came out and yelled, \u201cThe Qin Clan has arrived.\u201dAfter this was heard, a ferocious energy erupted from within the Fang Clan. A lofty man with a white tiger robe draped over his body strode over. Despite his face being all smiles, his energy was still very fierce. This person coming was the Patriarch of the Fang Clan, Fang Li. As Fang Li appeared, the attendees and disciples of the Qin Clan began to feel their hearts tighten.\u201cQin Clan, you are here. Let me first begin to say, Brother Qin Tian, our grounds are small so we can\u2019t give you a grand welcome. Please pardon me,\u201d Fang Li said with a welcoming smile. His eyes didn\u2019t even glance at Qin Tieba at all; it was fixed solely on Qin Tian.Qin Tieba\u2019s face changed. One had to understand that although Qin Tian was the Patriarch, who didn\u2019t know that the one who really held the power in Qin Clan right now was Qin Tieba? This action by Fang Li was basically like smacking Qin Tieba\u2019s face. However, currently they were in the Fang Clan\u2019s territory. Additionally, it was also the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2019s \u2018Disciple Recruiting Ceremony\u2019. Even if Qin Tieba\u2019s temper was worsening, he still had to hold it back.\u201cFang Clan is already extravagant enough, Brother Fang Li. Let\u2019s not waste time on exchanging greetings. Don\u2019t make the two elders wait\u2026\u201d Qin Tian remained calm, he did not mind this at all.\\nFang Li didn\u2019t say anything else. He brought the crowd of people into the Fang Clan. However, on the way there, he took the initiative to talk to Qin Tian, and even asked about Qin Nan. He did not shoot any glances at Qin Tieba, who was beside him. Fang Li brought the crowd from the Qin Clan directly into their Martial Training Ground.Within the Martial Training Ground was a grand platform. This grand platform was of white jade, and appeared prominently luxurious. Beneath this grand platform was a fifty Mi circumference long arena. Atop the arena were rows of seats. Qin Nan followed behind Qin Tian while remaining calm and collected. He began to sweep his gaze across the disciples of the Fang Clan.His gaze was immediately fixed on a youth. This youth was wearing a white robe, and his figure was similar to Fang Li, exceedingly lofty. However, this youth was emanating an aura that showed he had only achieved the third-layer of Body Tempering stage. As Qin Nan was sizing up this youth, the youth was naturally also looking through the crowd of people from Qin Clan. However, his eyes were filled with a heavy scorn.\u201cIt seems like that person is Fang Rulong. He possesses a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. It\u2019s impossible for him to have only achieved the third-layer of Body Tempering stage. It seems like he is hiding his cultivation,\u201d Qin Nan guessed roughly in his heart. His gaze quickly shifted to the grand platform.Qin Nan really wanted to know just how powerful were these people from Mystic Spirit Sect? Additionally, in the instant Qin Clan\u2019s gaze looked over, he could feel another gaze coming from the grand platform. As the two gazes collided, Qin Nan\u2019s face suddenly changed.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In front of this power, Qin Nan became like an ant- he could be pulverized by it at any time.\u201cWhat a frightening power\u2026.\u201dQin Nan bit the tip of his tongue and suppressed his mood as he observed the person the gaze belonged to.Atop the white-jade grand platform was a girl sitting upright.The girl\u2019s complexion was silky white, her brows like a half moon. Her eyes were like a hook drawn by a paint brush. Not only that, this girl also wore a purple robe tightly wrapped around her body. As the sunlight reflected the girl\u2019s skin and purple robe, it gave rise to a certain divine aura. A breathtaking feeling bubbled forth from Qin Nan\u2019s heart- he couldn\u2019t help but look awestruck.\u201cHuh?\u201d The girl on top of the grand platform seemed a little startled. Her face revealed a trace of deliberation as she sized Qin Nan up.Qin Nan immediately woke from his trance. The girl\u2019s gaze felt like a sharp sword stabbing through his body, causing Qin Nan to feel like he couldn\u2019t hide any secrets from her.This kind of scrutiny made Qin Nan feel exceedingly uncomfortable. Fortunately, the other party was only quickly going through him without meticulously analyzing him. This caused Qin Nan to sigh in relief as he quickly shifted his own gaze.Qin Nan then shifted his gaze onto the other person atop the white-jade grand platform. It was a middle-aged man. This middle-aged man wore a white robe with a golden cuff- on his chest were three golden dragons. He had a malevolent appearance, and gave off an incomparably tyrannical feeling. Moreover, this middle-aged man did not try to conceal his own majestic and seemingly immeasurable tyrannical aura.\\n\u201cThese two Elders of the Mystic Spirit Sect are extremely powerful. They\u2019re at least at the peak of the Xiantian Realm. Especially this girl\u2026 it\u2019s possible that she has even surpassed the Xiantian Realm\u2026\u201d Qin Nan thought to himself, as his yearning toward the Mystic Spirit Sect grew increasingly stronger.Any two random people coming from the Mystic Spirit Sect were at this level of cultivation. In that case, just how powerful was the Mystic Spirit Sect?However, Qin Nan didn\u2019t comprehend a certain fact- he, who was at the fifth-layer Body Tempering stage, could actually estimate the Realm that two Elders of the Mystic Spirit Sect were at. Moreover, his estimation wasn\u2019t too far from the truth.What Qin Nan hadn\u2019t realized was that ever since the last transformation of the Divine Battle Spirit, his eyesight had gotten increasingly stronger. It seemed to contain many mysteries.As the Qin Clan entered the grounds, they were coincidentally seated opposite the Fang Clan, giving rise to an intense battle intent. However, although the Qin Clan and the Fang Clan\u2019s people gave off a hostile aura, most of their gazes were actually directed toward the grand platform. It was very clear that they were just like Qin Nan; they were overflowing with curiosity toward the two Elders dispatched from the Mystic Spirit Sect.At that moment, Fang Li\u2019s figure leapt and landed on the arena. He was facing the crowd with a very flushed complexion; it seemed like he was a little excited:\u201cLadies and Gentlemen, I would like to formally introduce you once again. These two are from the Mystic Spirit Sect; Elder Xiao Qingxue, and Elder Bai Heng. \u201cAs his voice faded, a deafening applause erupted from the crowd. The present disciples all carried excitement on their faces as they looked toward the top of the white-jade grand platform. Their eyes were brimming with a fiery reverence.\\nThe middle aged man, Elder Bai Heng, seemed to be enjoying this scene. His face revealed a great arrogance, following which Elder Bai Heng stood and spoke in a loud voice,\u201cYou have the honor of attending the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2019s Disciple Recruiting Ceremony this time\u2026 That\u2019s all I wanted to say- Fang Li, we can start now.\u201dIn just these short words, one could feel the despise he had for the people in Linshui City. Not only that, but also his tyrannical power was completely obvious. However, the crowd didn\u2019t feel it was unfair. Only Qin Nan had slightly creased his eyebrows.As Bai Heng said this, Fang Li promptly said,\u201cAlright. Let us start the first round: the Martial Art Competition. I assume everyone knows the rules, so come on stage one by one and draw a stick number. The pattern will begin with number one battling against number sixty. The person who draws number thirty will immediately be disqualified.\u201dThe disciples present immediately walked towards the arena to draw a stick number. Qin Nan was not in a hurry, as he walked behind and casually drew a stick number. As he drew it, a large character saying \u2018One\u2019 could be seen.\u201cWhat number are you?\u201d Qin Tian and Tie San immediately moved closer to ask.\u201cNumber one,\u201d Qin Nan raised his hand, and said indifferently, \u201cIt seems like I\u2019ll be the first fight.\u201dQin Tian and Tie San nodded their heads without saying anything else. Qin Nan\u2019s face seemed extremely tranquil, he didn\u2019t seem to have the nervosity of someone who would be in the first fight. He took a large stride toward the arena.\u201cQin Nan, how come it\u2019s you?!\u201d Suddenly, an incomparably gloomy voice resounded.Qin Nan turned around to look, only to get a slight shock. He never imagined that the person would actually be one of the geniuses of the Qin Clan, Qin Hai.\\nQin Nan had quite a poor impression of Qin Hai. This was because Qin Hai would regularly defame Qin Nan within the Qin Clan. He had gone as far as to completely ridicule Qin Nan during the Disciple Examination. Thinking about this, Qin Nan\u2019s face revealed an curious color.Could this possibly be karma?Qin Hai\u2019s complexion turned extremely ugly. The people of the Qin Clan beneath, including Qin Changkong and Qin Tieba, looked at Qin Hai with faces full of sympathy. Although Qin Nan only had a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, he could still overpower Qin Changkong with his fourth-layer Body Tempering stage.Qin Hai only had a fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit with a cultivation of the second-layer Body Tempering stage, how could he possibly be Qin Nan\u2019s match? Besides, Qin Hai had verbally attacked Qin Nan very frequently. Knowing Qin Nan\u2019s temperament, he will definitely not let Qin Hai go.\u201cStop dawdling, hurry up and start.\u201d At this time, Bai Heng\u2019s impatient voice resounded.Bai Heng didn\u2019t feel any kind of excitement toward this kind of Martial Art Competition. Although the Martial Art Competition was for observing the strength of the Martial Spirit, the most important factor was still the grade of Martial Spirit during the Disciple Recruitment. As long as the grade of your Martial Spirit is sufficient, then you would definitely be recruited into the Sect. Besides, in a small place like Linshui City, were there any geniuses other than Qin Changkong of the Qin Clan and Fang Rulong of the Fang Clan? Thus, Bai Heng was acting like this. He had no feelings whatsoever toward these trash.\u201cQin Nan, you\u2026\u201d As Qin Hai heard Bai Heng\u2019s words, his heart began to tremble. However, he still didn\u2019t move. This was because Qin Hai was very clear on the fact that he was not a match for Qin Nan.\\nAs he thought of himself as a genius who possessed a fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, he should have an opportunity to enter the Mystic Spirit Sect. However, if he were to be defeated by Qin Nan here, then would he, Qin Hai, have another opportunity to enter the Mystic Spirit Sect?As he thought about this, Qin Hai began to hold his breath even more. If he didn\u2019t become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect here, then it\u2019s possible that he would never have that opportunity for the rest of his lifetime.\u201cCalm down, calm down. My cultivation may not be on par with his, however I\u2019m sure I still have other methods\u2026.\u201d Qin Hai was incessantly contemplating in his heart, his mind operating at a fast speed. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. A particular idea came to him.Qin Hai began to relax. His face recovered its calm. Instead of making a move, he began to shout loudly,\u201cQin Nan, how about you just admit defeat? As long as you admit defeat, I\u2019ll be able to give you boundless benefits when I become a disciple of Mystic Spirit Sect. This will allow you to continue a good life for the rest of your days.\u201dAs these words were being spoken, the crowd were slightly shocked.Qin Hai actually wanted someone to admit defeat?Qin Nan was also slightly shocked. He never thought that Qin Hai would actually say this out loud. However, Qin Nan quickly recovered his calm, his face not showing any emotion.Qin Hai sensed the gaze from the crowd and completely ignored them. Instead, when he saw that Qin Nan didn\u2019t give a reply, his heart began to feel even more anxious and he said, \u201cQin Nan, in regards of cultivation, I am definitely not your match. However, you are merely a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit waste. You are destined to not enter the Mystic Spirit Sect in this lifetime. You might as well give this opportunity to me, and when the time comes, I will definitely return the favor a hundredfold\u2026..\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re noisy! Get out of here!\u201dBefore Qin Hai could finish what he was saying, a thunderous voice resounded. One could see Qin Nan\u2019s face was incomparably cold. This was because he never thought that while Qin Hai was begging him to admit defeat, he would also call him a waste. Thus, Qin Nan no longer wanted to stay still. His Saber Intent surged and suppressed Qin Hai. In this instant, Qin Hai\u2019s complexion suddenly changed greatly, his body couldn\u2019t help but tremble.Qin Hai could only feel that his surrounding suddenly turned cold. An incorporeal killing intent was continuously wreaking havoc, it was as though a great Saber with flickering cold light was on top of his head. It felt like it would fall on down on him and sever his life.\u201cI\u2026.. I\u2026.. I\u2026..\u201dQin Hai opened his mouth, his face filled with fear. He couldn\u2019t stop repeating the word \u2018I\u2019. At this time, it was as though he had lost the ability to think, leaving only the fear of death incessantly breeding within his heart.At this moment, the entire audience was silent for a few breaths. Following this, their faces immediately gave rise to great shock.How is this possible?Just what is this surging cold intent?How did Qin Nan put out such a formidable aura?Even the originally impatient Elder Bai Heng on top of the white-jade grand platform was shocked. He was unable to conceal the shock rising to his face,\u201cThis is\u2026.fifth-layer of the Body Tempering stage? \u2018Greater Success\u2019 in \u2018One with the Saber\u2019?\u201dBehind Elder Bai Heng, Elder Xiao\u2019s eyes also shone slightly.The Disciple Recruitment Ceremony this time was getting quite interesting!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

None of them could ever have imagined that Qin Nan had actually achieved the fifth-layer Body Tempering stage.Wasn\u2019t Qin Nan just a waste?This was especially so for Fang Li and Fang Rulong; the shock in their hearts was much greater than these disciples\u2019. This was because these disciples did not understand the significance of Greater Success in the \u2018One With The Saber\u2019 realm. However, Fang Li and Fang Rulong did.One had to understand that even within the Fang Clan, there were only two people who had reached Greater Success in \u2018One With The Weapon\u2019. The Fang Clan\u2019s side was shocked, but the Qin Clan\u2019s side was even more so. Qin Tieba, Qin Changkong, and the crowd of Elders were almost petrified. This was because they were very clear on the fact that Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation was only at the fourth-layer Body Tempering stage just a few days earlier.How did he reach the fifth-layer Body Tempering stage now? And he even grasped the Greater Success in \u2018One with the Saber\u2019 realm?Wasn\u2019t Qin Nan a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit waste? How was it possible that his current speed was so exceedingly frightening?On top of the white-jade grand platform, Elder Bai Heng quickly came to his senses. However, his complexion looked slightly ugly. His eyes carried a bitter air as they swept over Fang Li.The Qin Clan had such a peerless genius, and yet Fang Li had actually been hiding it from him?Fang Li\u2019s heart suddenly felt chilled, and cold sweat immediately spread across his forehead, making him promptly say,\u201cElder Bai Heng, the Martial Spirit he awakened is only first-grade Huang ranked. The source behind his current cultivation is because he came across a fortuitous encounter in the Longhu Mountain Range.\u201d\\nOnly after Fang Li said this did the disciples and Elders of the Fang Clan calm down, after which they came to a sudden realization\u2026Within the Longhu Mountain Range there were some good things. It only made sense he was able to reach the fifth-layer Body Tempering stage in half a month thanks to this fortuitous encounter.Otherwise, who would know how many years it\u2019d take for a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit to reach this level?Within the Fang Clan, Fang Rulong who was sitting on the first seat had a foul expression. After he heard this, he came back to his senses and looked into Qin Nan\u2019s eyes, his own brimming with contempt.So what if you, Qin Nan, are at the fifth-layer Body Tempering stage? So what if you have reached the Greater Success in \u2018One with the Saber\u2019? You\u2019re destined to be a waste with your first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.\u201cI see. A first-grade Huang ranked trash,\u201d Elder Bai Heng said in response. He felt he had been deceived and his mood turned sour, causing his voice to become frigid, \u201cAlright. Stop delaying this battle and finish it.\u201dAt this moment, Elder Bai Heng\u2019s attitude towards Qin Nan turned exceedingly cold. At the same time, the words Elder Bai Heng said caused not only the Fang Clan, but also the Qin Clan, to look at Qin Nan with faces full of ridicule.You have caused Elder Bai Heng to be in a bad mood, what kind of future could you possibly have from now on?Within the Qin Clan, Qin Tian and Tie San\u2019s faces turned exceedingly ugly. However, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it, or else they would cause a huge disaster. Thus, they could only hold it back.On top of the arena, Qin Nan\u2019s expression became frosty, but was withdrawn so quickly that no one saw even the slightest waver. Although the words Elder Bai Heng said made him angry, he didn\u2019t let it get to his head. If he were to reveal the slightest bit of killing intent, then Elder Bai Heng would inevitably make a move towards him. \\nThis was definitely something Qin Nan didn\u2019t want to see happening.\u201cGet lost,\u201d Qin Nan yelled. He no longer continued to restrain the Saber Intent emanating from his body, causing it to grow increasingly formidable as it surged forth.\u201cI\u2026 go\u2026I concede\u2026I will leave immediately\u2026\u201d As Qin Hai heard this, he began to repeatedly surrender. He even carried a slight pleading look as he glanced toward the judges at the side.No matter what attitude the Fang Clan, Qin Clan, or Elder Bai Heng had towards Qin Nan, Qin Hai only knew that he himself was about to collapse. Even if Qin Nan wanted him to kneel down, Qin Hai would kneel down without hesitation. One had to understand that during the Martial Art Competition, there were no rules that stated one could not kill the other. Thus, as long as he could survive, Qin Hai would do whatever he needed to survive.\u201cVictory goes to Qin Nan!\u201d The judge also promptly yelled out.Qin Nan turned around to leave, no longer caring about the Qin Clan\u2019s people who had been jubilant in his misfortune. He sat down on his seat, his face tranquil, as though his surroundings had nothing to do with him.After this, the Martial Art Competition continued. However, after Qin Nan\u2019s astonishing performance, the following battles were very dull. After all, even those who possessed a fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit were only at the second-layer Body Tempering stage presently.After the thirteenth battle was over, the judge said,\u201cNext up, Fang Rulong of the Fang Clan. Qin Li of the Qin Clan.\u201dFang Rulong!As this name appeared, it immediately caught everyone\u2019s attention, especially the Qin Clan\u2019s. Their gazes were all focused on Fang Rulong. Everyone in Linshui City knew that Fang Rulong was the Young Lord of the Fang Clan. They didn\u2019t know what kind of Martial Spirit he had awakened, but according to the rumors spreading from the Fang Clan, Fang Rulong had awakened a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit!\\nA fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was a pinnacle genius within Linshui City. Within the Qin Clan, there was only Qing Changkong who possessed one such.\u201cHmph,\u201d Qing Changkong noticed everyone\u2019s gazes being attracted to Fang Rulong and promptly revealed a cold smile, \u201cJust insignificant Fang Rulong, and yet you all care this much? The one who will inevitably become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect is me.\u201dAs Qin Changkong said this, the other Elders and attendees promptly nodded their heads. After all, Qin Changkong had already been selected as a disciple for the Mystic Spirit Sect. Attending the Disciple Selection today was just for appearances.Fang Rulong, who was he to come and cause strife with Qin Changkong?The person Fang Rulong was battling, Qin Li, had strength classified somewhere in the middle within the Qin Clan. He had awakened a third-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. Although his cultivation hadn\u2019t reached the second-layer Body Tempering stage, and was only at the insignificant first-layer, his aura was solemn, and it was evident that he was at the peak of the first-layer Body Tempering stage.Fang Rulong entered the arena and took a glance at Qin Li before he suddenly laughed, and while astonishing everyone said,\u201cWhat qualifications does a trash like you have to battle me? I will now give you two options: one is to surrender, the other is to have me annihilate you.\u201dAs his voice faded, a ferocious aura surged from his body. It was from the third-layer Body Tempering stage, and its aura was exceedingly evil. The faces of the people in the Qin Clan changed, and even Qin Nan creased his eyebrows. This Fang Rulong was indeed very arrogant. He wanted someone to surrender the second he opened his mouth; this was simply not placing the Qin Clan in his eyes. \\n\u201cArrogant!\u201d Anger swelled up on Qin Changkong\u2019s face, followed by a cold voice.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that this Fang Rulong thinks he is the number one genius of Linshui City?\u201dThe other attendees and Elders were also incomparably resentful, and voiced their complaints. Fang Rulong stood on top of the arena and acted as though he didn\u2019t hear them. His laugh became increasingly louder,\u201cI\u2019ll give you the time of five breaths to consider\u2026\u201d\u201cOne, two, three\u2026.\u201dQin Li\u2019s complexion suddenly turned red; his eyes were filled with fire, and he felt incredibly angry.Fang Rulong\u2019s action was simply humiliating him!However, as Qin Li looked into Fang Rulong\u2019s wolf-like gaze, his heart suddenly felt a cold shudder. For reasons even he did not know, Qin Li\u2019s heart gave in to a fear that continued breeding. It was like icy water poured over his abdomen, causing his fury to completely wash through. Suddenly, Qin Li\u2019s heart caved in\u2014as he said,\u201cI surrender! I choose to surrender\u2026\u201dQin Li\u2019s decision was not at all unexpected from the crowd. Even the people of the Qin Clan couldn\u2019t blame Qin Li for his choice. After all, the difference in cultivation between Qin Li and Fang Rulong was off by two layers; even their Martial Spirits had a great disparity. If it was someone else, they\u2019d still make the same choice.However, the following scene caused their eyes to suddenly widen.Before Qin Li could finish his words, Fang Rulong suddenly smiled while baring his teeth; his smile was incomparably vicious. Following this, his figure became like a frantic demonic beast, suddenly charging over. His fist carried a boundless strength as he struck at Qin Li\u2019s body.\u201cAh\u2014\u2014\u201dA heart-tearing, lung-shredding shriek immediately resounded. Qin Li\u2019s lost consciousness as his body was struck and sent flying towards the ground.\\nThe audience turned silent because no one had expected Fang Rulong to suddenly make his move! Fang Rulong stood on top of the arena, and while he raised his head, a smile of contempt showed across his face,\u201cTrash doesn\u2019t have the qualifications to surrender before me. Trash shouldn\u2019t live in this world\u2014thus, you will have to become a cripple!\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not only did he humiliate Qin Li, but he had unexpectedly turned the Qin Clan disciple into a cripple in a single move.This action was a public slap to the Qin Clan\u2019s face\u2014he was not placing the Qin Clan in his eyes.In this instant, Qin Tian stood up\u2014his face filled with anger\u2014and said, \u201cFang Li, what is the meaning of this? It\u2019s just a Martial Art Competition, how could you beat someone \u2018til they\u2019re crippled?\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t for Tie San holding Qin Tian back, it was possible that Qin Tian would\u2019ve rushed towards Fang Rulong and struck at him.Although Qin Tian didn\u2019t have the same position in the Qin Clan as before, at the end of the day, they were all still part of the Qin Clan. Qin Tian would not stare helplessly as the people of the Qin Clan got bullied and humiliated by the Fang Clan.Fang Li\u2019s face didn\u2019t change. He didn\u2019t put Qin Tian\u2019s rage in his eyes, and the corner of his mouth even curved up into a smile as he said, \u201cPatriarch Qin Tian, what you\u2019ve said is wrong. Firstly, life and death doesn\u2019t matter in this competition. Secondly, I approve of Fang Rulong\u2019s action; I also believe trash shouldn\u2019t survive in this world\u2014they can only become crippled.\u201dThe faces of the Qin Clan changed once more.They never thought that Fang Li would say something like this. It was clearly saying: \u201cOur Fang Clan will definitely oppose your Qin Clan.\u201d\u201cGood, very good!\u201d At this time, Qin Changkong was no longer able to hold back the rage in his heart\u2014he laughed three times. His face was dark, his eyes incessantly sweeping past the numerous disciples of the Fang Clan, when he said, \u201cSince this is how those of the Fang Clan handle things, then I would like to see what kind of level the disciples of the Fang Clan are really at\u2026.\u201d\\nNot only Qin Changkong\u2014but also the other disciples and elders of the Qin Clan\u2014began to laugh coldly, their eyes flickering with killing intent.Since your Fang Clan is acting so shamelessly towards our Qin Clan, then don\u2019t blame us for being impolite.Do they think the Qin Clan is just a simple pushover that anyone can mess with?However, at this moment, a sudden laugh sounded. The person the laugh came from was Bai Heng.As Elder Bai Heng laughed, the attention of the Qin Clan and the Fang Clan was naturally drawn to him.Bai Heng\u2019s face was rosy; it looked like he was feeling incomparably joyful as he opened his mouth, \u201cAlright, stop fighting. I think Fang Rulong\u2019s method is correct; wastes should become crippled\u2014they should die.\u201dAs this was said, the Qin Clan\u2019s complexion changed slightly.The attendants and elders of the Qin Clan started to fawn over Elder Bai Heng.Only Qin Tian and Tian San had a terrible look on their faces, but they somehow came to an understanding; under such a circumstance, it was not the best time to unleash their anger.If they were to lose their tempers, then they would find themselves facing Elder Bai Heng\u2019s rage.Who in the entire Qin Clan would be able to stop him if that happened?As Elder Bai Heng heard their words, he nodded his head in satisfaction, \u201cNot bad, the people of the Qin Clan are quite understanding. Qin Changkong, do your best. I still hold expectations for you.\u201dAfter hearing this, Qin Changkong and the others of the Qin Clan could not help but let out a sigh of relief.As long as Elder Bai Heng didn\u2019t lose his temper, so what if Fang Rulong were to cripple a few disciples of the Qin Clan?\\nOn seeing the reaction of the Qin Clan, a scornful and proud look appeared on Fang Li\u2019s and Fang Rulong\u2019s faces. They had long expected this scene to play out.Not only those two, but every disciple and elder of the Fang Clan appeared to be exceedingly excited.Elder Bai Heng was helping the Fang Clan; why would they be scared of the Qin Clan?Xiao Qingxue stood in silence on top of the white-jade platform, her beautiful eyes observing everything that took place. From the beginning until now, she hadn\u2019t spoken a single word. However, a nearly-hidden trace of contempt appeared in her attractive eyes as they scanned over those of the Qin Clan who were bent forward fawning over Elder Bai Heng.Following this\u2014with a sudden thought\u2014Xiao Qingxue instinctively looked at the young man who had been able to stare directly into her eyes before.Qin Nan sat at his previous location. He had a calm expression throughout the whole process, as if he was not afraid that Elder Bai Heng was helping the Fang Clan; neither was he furious that Fang Rulong had crippled the Qin Clan\u2019s disciple.Even though Qin Nan was good at hiding it, Xiao Qingxue with her sharp eyes was able to detect the hint of an icy-cold gaze from his eyes.Xiao Qingxue felt a bit curious as she thought to herself: How will he react to the situation?While Xiao Qingxue was pondering, Fang Rulong\u2014who was sitting in front of the Fang Clan\u2014appeared to have reminded himself of something, and looked towards Qin Nan.A cold expression appeared on Fang Rulong\u2019s face as he couldn\u2019t hold back a chuckle, \u201cYoung Lord Qin Nan, you\u2019re just trash with a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. Why are you staring at me with such a ferocious look? Are you planning to do something to the Fang Clan\u2019s disciples with such a weak cultivation base?\u201d\\nUpon hearing this, the Qin Clan\u2019s expressions changed as they glanced at Qin Nan.When Elder Bai Heng heard these words, his smile disappeared immediately. He wasn\u2019t fond of Qin Nan to begin with, and together with the words of Fang Rulong, his feelings of enmity towards Qin Nan grew. His face turned icy cold, and a terrifying invisible aura could be sensed rising from his body.As Elder Bai Heng unleashed his aura, the atmosphere froze immediately.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why would you drag us all with you?At this particular moment, the disciples, deacons and elders of the Qin Clan were filled with hatred toward Qin Nan, only they were not brave enough to reveal it.No change was seen in Qin Nan\u2019s expression, as if the aura from Elder Bai Heng had no impact on him.Under everyone\u2019s glare, Qin Nan rose and gave Elder Bai Heng a bow, before saying with a sincere tone, \u201cElder Bai Heng, I have no intention of vengeance. I believe Young Master Fang Rulong had a misunderstanding. If I have troubled Young Master Fang Rulong, please accept my apology.\u201dAfter Qin Nan finished this sentence, he gave another bow in the Fang Clan\u2019s direction.Elder Bai Heng\u2019s expression calmed down after the apology. He even felt a sense of satisfaction when Qin Nan bowed his head. He waved his hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry; although you\u2019re trash, you still have some manners. Let\u2019s forget it and continue the duels.\u201d\\nAs Elder Bai Heng\u2019s aura diminished, everyone\u2019s breathing finally returned to normal.After seeing Qin Nan\u2014the Young Master of the Qin Clan, the past genius of Linshui City, who was now the ultimate trash\u2014bowing his head and apologizing, the Fang Clan were delighted, their faces turning red with excitement.On the other hand, the disdain on Fang Rulong\u2019s face grew even more.Even if your cultivation has reached the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm, and you have mastered the \u2018Greater Success Stage\u2019 of \u2018One with the Saber\u2019, so what? If I\u2014Fang Rulong\u2014want you to bow your head, then you must do it.In contrast, the Qin Clan were feeling relieved.The disciples, deacons and elders were giving Qin Nan an amiable look.This was especially true for Qin Changkong, who initially thought Qin Nan would play a dirty trick at this critical moment and drag him to death. However\u2014unexpectedly\u2014Qin Nan took responsibility and apologized immediately, which even satisfied Elder Bai Heng.\u201cLooks like I should change my plan. Once I\u2019ve joined the Mystic Spirit Sect, I will only get rid of his cultivation base\u2014instead of taking his life. I believe Qin Nan would thank me for sparing his life\u2026\u201d Qin Changkong thought to himself, who straight up reduced Qin Nan\u2019s penalty.Immediately after, the duelling tournament continued to take place.Whenever it was Qin Changkong\u2019s turn\u2014even though his opponents from the Fang Clan merely possessed cultivation bases of the first-layer Body Tempering Realm along with second-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirits\u2014Qin Changkong would be extremely polite and was not willing to seriously injure them during the duels.This behaviour caused the Fang Clan to be even more cocky.When they saw this, the Qin Clan and Qin Chankong were not bothered at all. So what if we are embarrassing ourselves? Anything is better than enraging Elder Bai Heng and wrecking our future.\\nThe tournament was in full swing. It was finally Qin Nan\u2019s turn in the twenty-eighth match.Qin Nan\u2019s debut attracted everyone\u2019s attention; as he possessed the highest cultivation base among all the disciples in Linshui City, it was expected that he would be everyone\u2019s focus.Qin Nan\u2019s opponent appeared\u2014it was someone from the Fang Clan.Standing opposite Qin Fan was a young lad, whose face was filled with pride. His name was Fang Yu\u2014he was quite famous in Linshui City.He was known for his fourth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and his cultivation base of the second-layer Body Tempering Realm. Furthermore, Fang Yu was talented in Martial Skills; he had mastered numerous high-class Martial Skills, and was considered the second best\u2014after Fang Rulong in the Fang Clan.As Fang Yu went onto the stage, he raised his head and looked at Qin Nan with a disdainful expression. Then\u2014with a smug tone\u2014he said, \u201cQin Nan, you should surrender. You\u2019re just a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit trash. You don\u2019t stand any chance. If you take the initiative to surrender, at least there\u2019s still some honor left for you\u2026\u201dIf Fang Yu were to face Qin Nan previously, he would have had pins and needles on his scalp from the feeling of hopelessness.However\u2014now\u2014Fang Yu was not scared of Qin Nan at all.Elder Bai Heng was in favor of the Fang Clan. What gave you\u2014Qin Nan, a piece of trash\u2014the right to disqualify a genius like me?The Fang Clan were treating this scene as a joke. However, not only were the people of the Qin Clan not ashamed of how they were being treated, but their eyes were flickering as if to tell Qin Nan to surrender!Despite that, Fang Yu did not even have the chance to finish his sentence\u2014both the Qin Clan and the Fang Clan couldn\u2019t help but notice this too.\\nSuddenly, an extremely sharp sword aura\u2014together with the sound of a thunder strike\u2014 had been heard from the stage.Fang Yu\u2019s eyes opened wide instinctively, but before he could react, a terrifying force tore his body in half.Fang Yu\u2019s whole body was separated in just a strike, killing him thoroughly!The area fell into complete silence. The crowd was still stunned from the scene.It was because everything happened too rapidly; it happened in less than a single breath\u2019s time\u2014too fast for their brains to react.Their brains had one\u2014and only one\u2014thought: Fang Yu is dead. Things were getting out of hand!Qing Nan, who was standing on the stage, slowly put away his Black Iron Sword. With a calm face, his eyes glanced in the direction of Fang Rulong, while he said, \u201cMy idea is the same as Young Master Fang Rulong\u2019s. There is no need for trash to live in this world. Furthermore, I\u2019m always clear of who to love and who to hate. If someone were to give me a punch, I\u2019d return two punches to the person. Hence, I\u2019m clearly telling you that for any Fang Clan disciple that I\u2019ll be facing, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dUpon saying this, Qin Nan paused, as a ferocious expression appeared on his face.\u201cI\u2019ll kill\u2019em all!\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The words of Qin Nan struck their brains like a bolt of lightning from the highest of heavens, causing their brains to buzz from the shock.Qin Nan\u2019s action was outside of everyone\u2019s expectation; it was much crueler than Fang Rulong. With just a slash, he ended the life of the second genius of the Fang Clan.Not only did he do it, he even said that he would kill every disciple of the Fang Clan who he would be dueling with!How cocky was that? How ruthless was that?The truth was, his action not only served as a vengeance directed at the Fang Clan, but was also a challenge to Elder Bai Heng\u2019s dignity\u2014a disrespectful challenge.Who exactly was Elder Bai Heng?Someone from the Mystic Spirit Sect.Even though no one knew just how powerful Elder Bai Heng was in the Mystic Spirit Sect, even disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect who were only in charge of miscellaneous affairs were highly respected in the Luo River Kingdom. Small clans like the Fang Clan and the Qin Clan were incomparable to them.Now, Qin Nan was going against a person like Elder Bai Heng in front of everyone!\u201cQin Nan, you\u2026\u201d Both father and son\u2014Fang Li and Fang Rulong\u2014 had shocked and furious expressions on their faces. Their fingers were pointed at Qin Nan, but they didn\u2019t know what to say.In that instant, both father and son were unable to find any words to describe what they just witnessed.In addition to Fang Li and Fang Rulong, everyone from the Qin Clan\u2014excluding Qin Tian and Tie San; who were just stunned\u2014had expressions of rage on their faces.\\nQin Nan is crazy, he dared to kill Bai Yu, and challenge Elder Bai Heng!Wouldn\u2019t his actions bring destruction to the whole Qin Clan, wouldn\u2019t he be dragging everyone to death with him?Qin Changkong\u2019s face was especially twisted with anger. He initially thought that Qin Nan had apologized after understanding the situation. However, his actions could only be described as an outlaw\u2019s.Qin Changkong didn\u2019t care about Qin Nan\u2019s life, but why would Qin Nan drag him to death too?The whole Qin Clan would not be able to withstand the anger of Elder Bai Heng!Above the high platform, Elder Xiao Qingxue was stunned for a while, but recovered shortly after, with a trace of a smile to be seen in her beautiful eyes, which went undetected.Elder Bai Heng also realized what had happened, but his expression was completely different than Elder Xiao Qingxue\u2019s\u2014his face was filled with fury.Even though his position in the Mystic Spirit Sect was not superior, he was still an outer disciple. Despite that, a first-grade Huang rank Martial Spirit trash\u2014who was merely a young master from one of the clans of the small Linshui City, in Luo River Kingdom\u2014was brave enough to oppose him and challenge his dignity!In Elder Bai Heng\u2019s opinion, it was a total slap in the face.Suddenly, Elder Bai Heng rose in a quick motion and released a burst of aura from his peak level of the Xiantian Realm, and dominated the place like an emperor\u2014releasing his anger.Everyone was trembling under the terrifying aura. Even Fang Li and Qin Tian who had both reached Xiantian Realm did not stand a chance against it, as their hearts were filled with terror.However, the most terrified ones were those of the Qin Clan.It was as if they could smell the scent of death. What were the chances for them to stay alive when Elder Bai Heng released his anger onto them?\\nApart from the terror in their hearts, the disciples, deacons, and elders of Qin Clan were also dominated by their hatred toward Qin Nan.If Qin Nan wasn\u2019t here, why would Elder Bai Heng be angry?If Qin Nan wasn\u2019t here, why would us of the Qin Clan be faced with utter disaster?Hatred. Hatred down through even their bone marrow. Hatred deep within their souls.At that moment, Elder Bai Heng wore a terrifying expression. He did not execute any attack, but gave Qin Nan a deadly stare. His Xiantian Realm Peak\u2019s aura was released toward Qin Nan, squashing him without mercy.At last, Elder Bai Heng spoke. His tone was calm, but behind that calm tone, a frightening bloodlust was exposed, \u201cQin Nan, do you know what you have just done?\u201dOn stage where everyone\u2019s focus was, even though Qin Nan\u2019s heart was racing; even though his blood was freezing and he almost fainted due to the suffocation from the terrifying pressure of the aura, his expression still remained the same\u2014as if he was not affected at all.\u201cI do know.\u201d Qin Nan said calmly, seemingly not noticing Elder Bai Heng\u2019s anger, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve only killed a piece of trash. Just like what Young Master Fang Rulong was saying, \u2018trash is not allowed to exist on this world.\u2019 However, Fang Rulong had only crippled his opponent, which I thought was nowhere enough. Hence, I\u2019ve decided to kill this trash without hesitation.\u201dQin Nan appeared to be fearless, as he continued, \u201cFurthermore, Elder Bai Heng, there were no rules for these duels between disciples\u2014no matter of life or death. It wasn\u2019t against the law when I killed Fang Yu, right? Why is Elder Bai Heng so angry?\u201dAfter he said this, everyone was shocked once again.The Recruiting Ceremony indeed does not have any rules for the duels. However, isn\u2019t Elder Bai Heng\u2019s words more important than the rules?\\nPlus, this Qin Nan even threw a question back at Elder Bai Heng asking, \u201cWhy is Elder Bai Heng so angry?\u201dYou, Qin Nan, dared to oppose Elder Bai Heng\u2019s words, why wouldn\u2019t he be angry?This Qin Nan is crazy\u2014he has completely lost his mind!\u201cWonderful, wonderful indeed. This is the first time I, Bai Heng, have experienced a Body Tempering Trash\u2014a first-grade Huang ranked trash\u2014directly opposing me!\u201d Bai Heng was so mad that he started laughing, and released a ferocious aura, \u201cI\u2019m telling you now that my words are the rules. If you dare to oppose me, I\u2019ll kill you. Not only you, but the whole Qin Clan will accompany you to hell!\u201dIn that instant, Elder Bai Heng\u2019s rage finally spilled over.His whole body then appeared to be gathering Chi, which transformed into a giant hand possessing gigantic force that slapped hard in Qin Nan\u2019s direction.\u201cNan\u2019er, be careful!\u201d Qin Tian finally reacted to the situation as he let out a loud yell. His expression changed as he rushed forward without hesitation.Even if he\u2014Qin Tian\u2014were to die today, he would not allow his son to be killed here.Suddenly, in the nick of time, a cold voice spoke up, \u201cBai Heng, are you done messing around? Stop it now.\u201dThe one who spoke was Xiao Qingxue, who had remained silent until now.Xiao Qingxue\u2019s words were like an invisible force which caused the raging Bai Heng to feel a sudden chill in his heart, causing him to stop his actions and relinquish his Chi.\u201cXiao\u2026 Senior Sister, what\u2019s this about?\u201d Bai Heng was confused, with a troubled look on his face.He was just trying to kill a trash\u2014to kill a waste. How come Xiao Qingxue had spoken up to stop him? Why was that?\\nNot only was Bai Heng confused, but everyone else was even more confused.Firstly, they did not expect Elder Bai Heng to call the beautiful lady his Senior Sister. Secondly, why was Elder Xiao stopping Bai Heng?\u201cBai Heng, what he said was right.\u201d Xiao Qinxue said calmly, \u201cIt was a duel; their background was not a factor. Do you really think that being a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect gives you the right to bully others? So what if he killed someone\u2014that just means his opponent was too weak. That\u2019s all, now stay here and watch the duels, and don\u2019t make any noise.\u201dAs Xiao Qingxue finished her sentence, a sense of coldness appeared within her beautiful eyes.Bai Heng\u2019s heart trembled, and an undetectable fear appeared in his eyes, and his forehead was covered with cold sweat.Although he did not understand why Xiao Qingxue interfered\u2014and even scolded him\u2014Elder Bai Heng did know that as Xiao Qingxue had already said not to, so he could never kill the trash.With this thought, Bai Heng\u2019s heart was filled with flames of anger. If it wasn\u2019t because of Qin Nan, the trash, why would he have made Xiao Qingxue unhappy?Everyone had a stunned expression on their faces\u2026 Qin Nan was unharmed?Without a doubt, this caused them to feel incredulous.Why did Qin Nan remain untouched after making Elder Bai Heng angry?Wasn\u2019t the expected outcome that Qin Nan would be killed, with all the Qin Clan being eliminated after? How come the reality was completely different?At that moment, everyone collected their thoughts and redirected their focus to Xiao Qinxue, who was behind Bai Heng.The initially furious Elder Bai Heng had no choice but to obey the order from this beautiful Elder Xiao\u2026 This indicated that the beautiful Elder Xiao\u2019s position and power were much more terrifying than Elder Bai Heng\u2019s.\\nOn seeing this, Qin Nan\u2019s racing heart felt relieved; his brain still felt a bit heavy.When he was facing Bai Heng\u2019s aura and his powerful attack, Qin Nan consumed a lot of energy just to maintain his unaffected appearance. If he did not have the eighth-grade Huang ranked Divine Battle Spirit\u2014along with his cultivation base\u2014he would have fainted straightaway.It was obvious how terrifying and powerful one was after reaching the peak of the Xiantian Realm.However, Qin Nan did not regret his actions, even though he was not close with Qin Li. Maybe Qin Li had even secretly mocked him, but Qin Nan would not remain silent.Why was the Fang Clan allowed to seriously injure the disciples of the Qin Clan? Yet the Qin Clan was not allowed to return the favor?Why was it that with just a sentence from Elder Bai Heng, the Qin Clan was not allowed to pay them back, but instead they needed to carefully obey his words?From the series of things that happened, Qin Nan clearly understood that the Fang Clan and Bai Heng were on the same side. It seemed like this Disciples Recruitment Ceremony was the Fang Clan\u2019s evil plan to eliminate the Qin Clan, with the help from Bai Heng. In return, Bai Heng must be obtaining some benefits from the Fang Clan\u2014thus, he agreed to destroy the Qin Clan.If that was the case, then Qin Nan would not remain idle.It\u2019s true that you are strong, Elder Bai Heng, plus you\u2019re a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect, and your cultivation has reached the peak of the Xiantian Realm, giving you a respectful identity.However, this was insignificant in Qin Nan\u2019s eyes. He possessed the Divine Battle Spirit, which was his ultimate trump card and support. His future was limitless. As a whole, there was no way that Bai Heng could be comparable to him.\\nThe only thing that troubled Qin Nan was Xiao Qinxue\u2019s attitude.Even though Qin Nan had his final card, Xiao Qinxue\u2019s interruption did save Qin Nan a lot of trouble.This made Qin Nan quite interested in the mysterious, powerful, and beautiful lady. From the way she behaved, it seemed like she was not on the same side as Bai Heng, and she was reasonable too.The atmosphere at the scene had now turned strange.Elder Bai Heng was sitting at the front with a terrible face, and remained silent. Xiao Qinxue\u2014who was behind him\u2014was quiet too.The people of the two clans had their gazes on Qin Nan. Their eyes were filled with complicated emotions such as hatred, shock, and even jealousy.Suddenly, it seemed like something came up in Xiao Qinxue\u2019s mind, who said, \u201cResume the duels, so we can move faster into the second round.\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - UnstoppablePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26 \u2013 UnstoppableThe situation had calmed down after Xiao Qingxue spoke.Both Fang Li and Fang Rulong wore dull expressions on their faces, while they sent death stares in Qin Nan\u2019s direction. If not because of their fear toward Xiao Qingxue, the father and son would have gone up to the fearless imbecile and killed him.It was as Qin Nan had predicted; Fang Li and Fang Rulong had come to a secret agreement with Elder Bai Heng. The initial plan was to annihilate the Qin Clan on the spot.However, Fang Li and Fang Rulong never thought that Qin Nan would have been fearless enough to oppose Elder Bai Heng\u2019s words, and kill the second genius of Fang Clan, causing a huge lost to the clan.\u201cFather, now the plan has to change. It looks like we won\u2019t be able to do anything in the first round anymore, after those words from Elder Xiao. If that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s wait for round two. I\u2019ll show them my true talent, and completely destroy the Qin Clan without mercy.\u201d Fang Rulong whispered into Fang Li\u2019s ear with a murderous aura.Fang Li nodded his head; the expression on his face had calmed down.Even though Qin Nan gained an advantage from Xiao Qingxue\u2019s help, when it came to the second round, Qin Nan still possessed a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014which was utterly useless. On the other hand, Fang Rulong had a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014more powerful than Qin Changkong\u2019s. From this point on, even Elder Xiao would not help the Qin Clan anymore.The Martial Arts world followed the law of the jungle; although Xiao Qingxue helped Qin Clan this time, there would not be a second time.It was because Fang Rulong was the true genius of Lingshui City; only he was worthy enough to become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect.\\nQin Nan noticed the gaze from the father and son duo of the Fang Clan. Apart from a wry smile, there was no sign of worry on his face. He came down from the arena and walked toward the Qin Clan.At this moment, the Qin Clan were looking at Qin Nan with weird expressions.They were not willing to let Qin Nan go against Elder Bai Heng, but they didn\u2019t dare to say it after Elder Xiao had spoken up. What gave them the right to say anything?Elder Xiao was more powerful than Elder Bai Heng. If she was helping the Qin Clan, it was something they should be happy with!Due to this reason, the Qin Clan had complicated feelings; they never expected Qin Nan to receive a blessing out of the misfortune.However, the next thing they knew, a shocking scene took place once again.The judge\u2019s forehead was dripping with cold sweat, as he said with a trembling voice, \u201cNext duel, number thirty-one. Qin Nan versus Fang Huo\u2026\u201dIn that instant, everyone stood stunned on the spot. They would never have expected that after Qin Nan\u2019s disrespectful declaration toward the Fang Clan and Elder Bai Heng, that he would be dueling with a Fang Clan\u2019s disciple so soon.Is this\u2026 what karma is?The people of the Fang Clan had terrible looks on their faces, since Fang Huo was the third genius\u2014after Fang Yu\u2014for their clan.Qin Nan revealed a brief smile and went onto the stage. His eyes scanned the Fang Clan calmly.At the same time, Fang Huo appeared on the stage too. A while ago, he was a cocky and prideful person. However, his face was now filled with terror; he did not have the appearance of the third genius of Fang Clan.\\n\u201cI\u2026 I surrender\u2026 I surrender\u2026\u201d As soon as Fang Huo got onto the stage, he yelled out immediately\u2014not caring about embarrassing himself.When facing such a fearless and malefic person as Qin Nan, pride was no longer important. Fang Huo still looked forward to his bright future; thus, dying here\u2014right now\u2014was not what he hoped for.He was willing to do anything to keep himself alive.Despite that, in that instant, a familiar thunderous sound was heard again. Following it was an icy slash, which tore Fang Huo into pieces.A killing slash\u2014without mercy.Everyone had their eyes opened wide, staring at the pouring blood on stage, completely stunned at what had just happened.Did the third genius of the Fang Clan simply die like that?Qin Nan had a calm face as he said, \u201cI have the same opinion as Young Master Fang Rulong; trash does not have the right to beg for mercy or surrender\u2014death is the only ending for them.\u201dUpon hearing this, a twisted expression appeared on the faces of Fang Li and Fang Rulong.Even Elder Bai Heng\u2014who was located on the platform\u2014was breathing heavily with a ghastly pale expression.However, they did not dare to move; they could only watch it happen, as Elder Xiao had given her say. They were not stupid enough to challenge Elder Xiao\u2019s power.Despite that, the tragedy did not come to an end. What happened next caused the atmosphere to be even more irregular!Number thirty-three. Qin Nan versus the fourth genius of Fang Clan!Number thirty-five. Qin Nan versus the fifth genius of Fang Clan!Every battle was the same as the ones before; with just a single breathtaking slash, the fourth and fifth geniuses of the Fang Clan were both killed.At this moment, the people of the Qin Clan were speechless\u2014and the same with the Fang Clan. Even Xiao Qingxue appeared to be slightly shocked.\\nIsn\u2019t all this\u2026 a bit too bizarre?As soon as the Fang Clan had offended the Qin Clan\u2014which caused Qin Nan to be angry\u2014his next four opponents all turned out to be disciples of the Fang Clan; is this a coincidence?Not only that, his opponents were the four geniuses of the Fang Clan after Fang Rulong!It was as if there was some force helping Qin Nan in secret. Are you trying to offend Qin Nan? Very well then, I\u2019ll give you the chance to learn how terrifying he is!In the meantime, everyone from the Fang Clan\u2014including Fang Li and Fang Rulong\u2014were staring at Qin Nan with wide eyes.Four of their geniuses had just died in such a brief period of time.Even though the Fang Clan was one of the top two clans in Lingshui City\u2014with a history of over a hundred years\u2014it was still unaffordable to lose four top geniuses like that.With their geniuses gone\u2014apart from Fang Rulong\u2014who among the Fang Clan was capable enough to lead the people?No one!If a clan planned to grow stronger, it could not rely on a single person; it needed many talents to work together, which would then allow the clan to grow and develop.These talents were the foundation of a clan.However\u2014in the time it took an incense stick to burn\u2014Qin Nan had destroyed their foundation.On the platform, Elder Bai Heng\u2019s veins showed on the surface of his skin. His aura rumbled within his body.Even though it was only a simple arrangement between him and the Fang Clan, Qin Nan\u2019s fearless action\u2014of killing four geniuses in a row\u2014felt like continuous slaps to Elder Bai Heng\u2019s face.The clan which Elder Bai Heng was looking after; how did he dare bully them?Not only Bai Heng, but the eyes of Fang Li and Fang Rulong were both red with rage, with a ferocious aura rumbling within them. They would go completely crazy if not for the remaining hint of sanity left in their minds.\\n\u201cQin Nan\u2014 you\u2014 nice\u2026 very nice. You\u2019re indeed very impressive.\u201d Fang Rulong\u2019s eyes were completely red; his voice squeezed out from his throat, as if he were a beast on the verge of going berserk, \u201cWhat you have done today, I will not forget! I hope you won\u2019t regret it when the time comes!\u201dThe last sentence felt like a deep roar from Fang Rulong.As a genius with a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, Fang Rulong was the top genius of Lingshui city\u2014since when had he felt so insulted before?However, the only thing he could do now was be patient. If he could not hold in his anger\u2014and infuriated Xiao Qingxue\u2014it would not matter if he was a genius with a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit; he would still bring ultimate disaster to the Fang Clan.As a result, Fang Rulong could only hold his murderous intent in, and threaten Qin Nan with words.Qin Nan made a wry smile upon hearing these words; he then said, \u201cStop that nonsense. Did you ever think of this when you disabled the Qin Clan\u2019s disciple? Despite that\u2014who do you think you are to threaten me!\u201dQin Nan\u2019s aura transformed immediately; it was the same as when he had challenged Bai Heng before\u2014ignorant and fearless.Qin Nan stared down at Fang Rulong with an icy-cold pair of eyes, as he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not impressed, come onto the stage and fight me. If you don\u2019t agree with my actions, don\u2019t just stand down there and argue with words. Fang Rulong, let me remind you, who do you think you are? You\u2019re just trash. If you\u2019re trash, then you should shut your mouth!\u201dPa!Fang Rulong opened his eyes wide; he felt like his face had been hit by a powerful slap. He started to become dizzy.\\nEndless feelings from being insulted and rage were rising up within his heart. He felt like letting out a roar and going straight onto the stage to fight Qin Nan.However, his legs were heavily rooted to the ground, as if endless molten iron was being poured onto them.Apart from Fang Rulong, other disciples of the Fang Clan found their faces flush with fury. However, besides their anger, there was also another overwhelming feeling.Fang Rulong didn\u2019t dare to move; the others didn\u2019t dare to move either.In that instant, Qin Nan appeared to be unstoppable!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The ones who advanced to the next round are Qin Nan, Qin Changkong, Fang Rulong\u2026\u201dThe first two disciples were obviously the two geniuses of the Qin Clan, which meant that in the first round of the trials, Fang Rulong was the only one from the Fang Clan to advance to the next round.However, the result surprisingly caused Fang Rulong and Fang Li to feel relieved; the people of Fang Clan felt relieved too.As the first round has ended, it indicates that Qin Nan would no longer be able to pick on us Fang Clan while relying on his cultivation base.Without his cultivation base, what could Qin Nan be considered to be? Only a piece of trash with a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.What right does a piece of trash have to go against us Fang Clan?Even Xiao Qingxue would not side with trash when the final moment came.\u201cQin Nan, now that the first round has ended, I would like to see what you can do in the second round. The trial in the second round will be focusing on the grade of the Martial Spirit, instead of fighting capabilities.\u201d When he walked onto the stage, Fang Rulong could not help but mock Qin Nan.Despite that, even at this moment, Fang Rulong did not dare to mock Qin Nan past his limits. He was scared that Qin Nan would say something to further embarrass him in front of everyone.In such circumstances, Fang Rulong could only hold back his murderous intent, and wait for the best chance to get his revenge on Qin Nan!\\nQin Nan stared sideways at him and remained speechless; his expression was as calm as always.Qin Nan did not say a word, but Qin Changkong walked up to Fang Rulong and said with an unpleasant tone, \u201cFang Rulong, there\u2019s no need to mock us. Do you really think the people of the Qin Clan are useless? Let me have a look at your Martial Spirit today, to see what grade of Martial Spirit you\u2019ve awoken that has given you such confidence.\u201dIn Qin Changkong\u2019s view, Fang Rulong was not a worthy opponent.Before\u2014when Fang Clan was under Elder Bai Heng\u2019s protection\u2014Qin Changkong would have been scared of him. However, now that his Qin Clan was being looked after by Xiao Qingxue, there was no longer any need to fawn over the Fang Clan.This was one only one of the reasons; the second reason was that\u2014according to rumors\u2014Fang Rulong possessed a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. As aforementioned, it was only a rumor which had yet to be confirmed. Even if it was true, Qin Changkong was not afraid at all.Qin Changkong was extremely confident; with his final trump card, it was not impossible to defeat Fang Rulong.Qin Changkong\u2019s mood had an upsurge. The rest of the Qin Clan were also in high spirits. Every deacon or elder of the Qin Clan was giving disdainful and mocking looks toward the Fang Clan.In order to join the Mystic Spirit Sect, receiving support from someone was useful, but the grade of Martial Spirit was the most important factor.What did Fang Rulong have to compete with Qin Changkong?\u201cSince when does a bunch of jesters dare to oppose me?\u201d On hearing the words of Qin Changkong, Fang Rulong ran out of patience, and looked disdainfully at Qin Changkong, as if he were looking at some trash.\\nDid Qin Changkong really think he was Qin Nan, who was strong enough to threaten him?In his view, Qin Changkong was only a clown.When he heard this, Qin Changkong immediately became furious.Since the limelight of the first round was stolen by Qin Nan, Qin Changkong planned to regather the focus of the crowd onto him by trash talking Fang Rulong.However, what made Qin Changkong frustrated was that Fang Rulong had dared to trash talk him back? While giving him a disdainful look too?This guy was too cocky; not willing to repent even when death was approaching.At this moment, on the list of must-kill targets in Qin Changkong\u2019s mind, Fang Rulong\u2019s rank had risen to the same level as Qin Nan\u2019s.\u201cAlright, let the second round begin. The rules are simple, you just need to present your Martial Spirit.\u201d Elder Bai Heng spoke with a dignified tone.The people of the Qin Clan found that the previous angry expression on Elder Bai Heng\u2019s face was gone; it was replaced by a pleasant smile, underlaid with a murderous aura waiting to be unleashed.The people of the Qin Clan were confused; wasn\u2019t Elder Bai Heng supposed to be annoyed after being challenged by Qin Nan?It was as the people of the Qin Clan had detected. There was no sense of anger to be found in Bai Heng\u2019s heart; there was only a hint of joy and an intention to kill.How would Elder Bai Heng not be mad after Qin Nan had opposed him? However, with the words spoken by Xiao Qingxue, Bai Heng did not dare to take action.Despite that, the situation would not be the same anymore. The second round of the recruitment would be focused on the grade of Martial Spirits. Qin Nan was a trash with a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit; what was there to be scared about? Not only that, Fang Rulong was about to become the genius in the spotlight in this round. Even after he joined the Mystic Spirit Sect, his position would not be too low with the talent that he possessed.\\nWith these two factors, Xiao Qingxue would no longer be protecting Qin Nan and his Qin Clan when the time came.Without the protection from Xiao Qingxue, would he\u2014Elder Bai Heng\u2014still be afraid of Qin Nan and the Qin Clan?Elder Bai Heng could not wait until the second round was finished, so that he could pressure the Qin Clan and torture Qin Nan, to make sure Qin Nan would forever remember that there was never a chance of a happy ending once he had offended Elder Bai Heng.\u201cSure, I\u2019ll start first!\u201d Qin Changkong could not wait any longer. He leapt a huge step out after hearing Elder Bai Heng\u2019s words, and started to gather his aura.Five rays of golden light were shining on Qin Changkong\u2019s back. A stunning white tiger rose from it and let out a roar, releasing a ferocious aura which covered the entire area!Five rays of golden light; a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit!In an instant, the atmosphere heated up, especially the Qin Clan, who were extremely excited. On the other hand, the disciples, deacons, and elders of the Fang Clan did not look well after seeing the majestic looking fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.It was a person with a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, who could be considered as the top genius of Lingshui City.\u201cFifth-grade Huang ranked; a beast type Martial Spirit, good at killing. If combined with powerful Martial Skills and the achievement of the state of \u2018One with the Beast\u2019, it would be even more powerful. Not bad.\u201d The beautiful eyes of Xiao Qingxue were calm like water, as she commented.It seemed like a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was not enough to spark her interest.Despite that, the words were enough for Qin Changkong to be elevated. Even Elder Xiao who was more powerful than Elder Bai Heng had said something about his Martial Spirit, which indicated that his potential was being acknowledged by Xiao Qingxue.\\n\u201cThank you, Elder Xiao!\u201dQin Changkong restrained his excitement and expressed his gratitude. As he turned around, he could not hide his proud expression as he gazed toward Qin Nan and Fang Rulong, \u201cHahaha, I\u2019ve shown my Martial Spirit. You two should show them yours too. I\u2019ve seen Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit before, so I\u2019m more interested in seeing what Martial Spirit the almighty Young Master of Fang Clan has awoken.\u201dQin Changkong\u2019s tone was filled with obvious sarcasm and disdain.The people of the Qin Clan were getting more excited too; their eyes were filled with more scornfulness looks toward the Fang Clan.\u201cHehe.\u201d Fang Rulong let out a laugh suddenly\u2014a mocking and cruel laugh, \u201cQin Changkong, remember what I\u2019m going to say. Trash has no rights before me, including the right to talk.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Qin Changkong turned incensed immediately.Did Fang Rulong call him trash? Calling someone with a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit trash?Even if Fang Rulong had a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit too, he shouldn\u2019t be so cocky, right?The faces of the Qin Clan were filled with anger. Why is Fang Rulong so cocky, just like Qin Nan? Who does he think he is?Suddenly, Fang Rulong moved; the same as Qin Changkong, he leapt forward a huge step.With a soft bang, Fang Rulong\u2019s initial aura of third-layer Body Tempering Realm improved until it reached the fourth-layer Body Tempering Realm. A vigorous and firm aura was felt, as if he was filled with enormous force.Besides that, six rays of golden light appeared on Fang Rulong\u2019s back. Among the golden rays, a golden hammer slowly appeared, which gave a hint of a terrifying force.In an instant, the whole area fell into silence.Qin Changkong had his eyes open wide. The people of the Qin Clan had their eyes open wide. Even the people of the Fang Clan had their eyes open wide, with stunned expressions on their faces.\\nSix rays of golden light\u2026 A sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?Fang Rulong turned around facing everyone, with a dominating expression, \u201cFirst of all, I would like to apologize to everyone here. The fact that I have awoken a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was only made known to the Patriarch and the elders of the Fang Clan. It was concealed to give everyone a surprise. Now that the surprise was made known, then I would like to declare something. I\u2014Fang Rulong\u2014am the number one genius of Lingshui City! All other disciples are trash!\u201dThe last few words felt like an explosion.The fangs of Fang Rulong and the Fang Clan, were\u2014at this moment\u2014finally exposed!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This time, Fang Rulong from the Fang Clan had managed to awaken such a powerful Martial Spirit.As such, the people of the Qin Clan\u2014whose brains went blank all at once\u2014shivered.Even Qin TIan and Tian San had an icy cold feeling passing over them in that instance, as they had figured out the truth after thinking back at the series of events.Why had Fang Rulong been so cocky and shown no mercy when he crippled Qin Clan\u2019s disciple?Why was Elder Bai Heng publicly helping the Fang Clan?These were all because Fang Rulong had a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, making him the real genius; Chang Qingkong, on the other hand, was insignificant compared to Fang Rulong.One cannot think that it was only the difference of a grade between the two; it was as significant as the gap between heaven and earth.\u201cHAHAHA, nice! Well said! In Lingshui City, you are the number one genius, while the others are trash!\u201d Elder Bai Heng raised his head and laughed loudly. The imperious expression had returned to his face, and\u2014for an unknown purpose\u2014he asked, \u201cElder Xiao, what do you think of this disciple?\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201d Xiao Qingxue seemed like she did not hear the question, and said with a slight nod, \u201cSixth-grade Huang ranked, a weapon type Martial Spirit which is good for combat. Great potential, you might have a chance to become a Martial Ancestor. I never expected to see such a talented person in this small Lingshui City. Looks like this trip was worth it.\u201d\\nEven though Xiao Qingxue had a calm expression while saying this, there were quite some compliments in it.Even comparing to the comment she gave to Qin Changkong, there were a few more compliments; the difference in attitude and the meaning behind it was huge.Elder Bai Heng was particularily joyful on the inside when he heard the words. Aren\u2019t you\u2014Xiao Qingxue\u2014sided with Qin Clan? Very well, let me show you that the Qin Clan is nothing in front of the Fang Clan.However, the words had pulled the Qin Clan back from their state of shock.Among the Qin Clan\u2014with Qin Tieba as their leader\u2014the previous cocky expressions were replaced by despairing faces, their eyes filled with terror.Sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, how overwhelming was that?They clearly understood that Qin Changkong was indeed insignificant in front of a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, just as Fang Rulong had said. For him, Qin Changkong was merely a useless piece of trash.Furthermore, it seemed like Fang Rulong was the only one to pass the trials and be selected to become a highly-respected disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect!With Fang Rulong\u2019s sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and with him now becoming a disciple of Mystic Spirit Sect soon, how would people treat him?Facing such an opponent, the Qin Clan was completely outmatched; they could only look up at him.The Qin Clan had fallen!\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Qin Changkong let out a cry of grief; with an unbelieving face he yelled, \u201cHow\u2026 How\u2026 How did you\u2026 How did you awaken a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2026 I\u2026 I won\u2019t believe it\u2026 I won\u2019t believe it\u2026 AHHHH\u2026\u201dQin Changkong had completely lost his mind.Aren\u2019t I supposed to be the top genius of Lingshui City? Aren\u2019t I the one that\u2019s supposed to become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect?\\nWhy did it all change so suddenly?Why did Fang Rulong have to awaken a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?\u201cHehe.\u201d Fang Rulong wore a calm and prideful expression, while he looked disdainfully at Qin Changkong and said, \u201cQin Changkong, weren\u2019t you trash-talking me just now? Do you think you are strong with your fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? Right now, you\u2019re just trash, and trash has no right to live before me!\u201dFang Rulong\u2019s face twisted, while he unleashed a murderous aura.The people of the Qin Clan trembled, their faces filled with fear. They never expected that the first thing Fang Rulong planned to do after showing his Martial Spirit was to kill the top genius of the Qin Clan.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dQin Changkong felt icy-cold as he was surrounded by the aura. Fear started growing in his heart. He did not hesitate to raise his head and shouted in the direction of the platform, \u201cElder Xiao, please stop him! Even though my Martial Spirit\u2019s grade is lower, it\u2019s still a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. I\u2019m considered a rare talent too\u2026\u201dQin Changkong\u2019s final hope was on Xiao Qingxue. However, when Xiao Qingxue heard the words spoken, her beautiful face remained as calm as always, without showing any sign of being affected.The Qin Clan was originally not her favorite. She only spoke out to help Qin Nan as she was a little impressed by his decision. Furthermore, she was here to recruit disciples for the Mystic Spirit Sect; Fang Rulong with his sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit would definitely be given a high position in the Mystic Spirit Sect.Hence, Xiao Qingxue would not interfere.The world of Martial Arts had always followed the law of the jungle.When he witnessed Xiao Qingxue\u2019s reaction with his sharp observation, Qin Changkong\u2019s face turned pale white, as if his soul had just been hit by a powerful blow, causing him to tremble, as if he had fallen into an ice cellar\u2014the cold chilling his spine.\\nAt this moment, Qin Changkong was terrified; he no longer had any hint of pride in him.He realized that this time he had failed; he was totally defeated.Looking at the cruel murderous aura on Fang Rulong\u2019s face, Qin Changkong\u2014who was having a mental breakdown after being exposed to the fear of death\u2014kneeled on his knees and started crying, \u201cBrother Fang, Young Master Fang Rulong, I beg you to spare my life\u2026 I will follow any order you give me if you do so\u2026 I\u2019m willing to be your slave if you spare my life\u2026\u201dThe people at the scene widened their eyes. No one could have imagined the genius Qin Changkong\u2014who had a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014 kneeling and begging for his life like an ant.\u201cTrash.\u201d Fang Rulong stopped on the spot and started laughing uncontrollably, full of smug pride.Didn\u2019t he wait for half a month\u2014just for today?Initially, he was planning to show his power and imperiousness by killing Qin Changkong, but he never expected him to be so weak\u2014kneeling down and begging for his life.\u201cRulong, there\u2019s no need to kill him.\u201d Fang Li said with a prideful face, \u201cThis trash might be useful to us if he come to Fang Clan. Now that you\u2019ve become a disciple of Mystic Spirit Sect, he would not dare to do anything stupid anymore.\u201dQin Changkong was pleased to hear this, and immediately replied, \u201cThank you Master! Thank you Master! I, Qin Changkong would never betray the Fang Clan. I\u2019ll do my best to help the Fang Clan\u2026\u201dThe Qin Clan were stunned. They never thought Qin Changkong would betray the Qin Clan and join the Fang Clan in such a short period of time.Seeing this, Qin Tian felt an anger rise within him as he stared straight at Fang Li, \u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cHAHA, Qin Tian, was it a surprise to you? Us of the Fang Clan have remained low-key for so long just to defeat your Qin Clan. To be honest, our power even now is enough to destroy your Qin Clan. However, I don\u2019t want to use that option; I would rather torture you, and completely eliminate the Qin Clan by letting the people of the Qin Clan be my slaves!\u201d Fang Li displayed a wicked smile and turned toward the Qin Clan, before he said in a loud voice, \u201cI\u2019ll give you guys one last chance. Learn from Qin Changkong; abandon the Qin Clan and join my Fang Clan. If not\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026be prepared to face our Fang Clan\u2019s wrath.\u201d Upon saying this, a twisted expression appeared on Fang Li\u2019s face.The expressions of the Qin Clan changed instantly; their hearts were filled with terror.In just less than five breaths\u2019 time, people lost their composure. The first to betray was Qin Tieba, who said with a loud voice, \u201cMaster of the Fang Clan, the choice my son Qin Changkong made will be my choice too. I\u2019m willing to join the Fang Clan, and contribute my strength\u2026\u201dAfter the words of Qin Tieba, the other deacons and elders of the Qin Clan immediately followed his actions.\u201cYeah yeah yeah, I would like to join Fang Clan too.\u201d\u201cF**k it, I was thinking of leaving the Qin Clan a long time ago!\u201d\u201cHAHAHA, thank you, Master of the Fang Clan. I\u2019m willing to contribute my all to the Fang Clan, even if it means my death.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only a few dozen disciples of the Qin Clan were left; they stood on the spot with blank expressions on their faces.Even Fang Rulong and Fang Li were shocked by the scene.As Fang Li collected his thoughts, his face turned red as if he were drunk, and he said disdainfully with an excited tone, \u201cQin Tian, are you seeing this? This is the Qin Clan you put effort into for the past ten years. With just a sentence, they have all betrayed you! Will you acknowledge it now\u2014that your Qin Clan is just a bunch of trash?\u201dWhen he heard this, Qin Tian\u2019s expression changed; a sudden hint of anger rose within him, but was soon replaced by helplessness and sadness.The words from Fang Li were the truth, which he could not deny.Following this, Fang Li had no intention of stopping there. He gave the remaining disciples a cold stare and said with an icy tone, \u201cSo, do you guys still want to stay in the Qin Clan? Hehe, I\u2019ll give you one last chance to join my Fang Clan! If not, you shouldn\u2019t bother trying to beg for a quick death later.\u201dFang Li threatened them straight away.Even though the remaining disciples were not outstanding among the Qin Clan\u2014they only had average talents and cultivation bases\u2014Fang Li planned to have everyone from the Qin Clan betray their leader.It would make him delighted if more disgrace was brought upon Qin Tian.\\nUnexpectedly, after Fang Li finished his sentence, the people who had just betrayed the Qin Clan and joined the Fang Clan\u2014including Qin Tieba\u2014started speaking.\u201cWhat are you trash waiting for? The master is giving you guys a chance to join us!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, come over here quick. Are you staying at the Qin Clan to wait for your deaths?\u201d\u201cI see that you guys are tired of living. I\u2019ll be the first one to kill you if you aren\u2019t joining us!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe behavior of these people had left others speechless.How shameless and ungrateful were these people to say such words?The remaining disciples of the Qin Clan had their eyes filled with terror as they faced the threats of the enemy. However, their legs were firmly rooted on the ground, as if molten iron was poured onto them, showing no signs of moving to the other side.\u201cI\u2019m grateful for your attitude. Now leave\u2014the Qin Clan is finished.\u201d Qin Tian said.There was an extremely calm expression on his face.Qin Tian knew it was over for the Qin Clan. If these disciples were to stay until the end, they would be facing death together with him; it was not worth for them.\u201cMaster, no extra word is needed. I will not leave!\u201dSuddenly, among the disciples, one of them shouted with an agitated tone.The person\u2014who seemed to be extremely weak and would be fainting any second now\u2014was Qin Li, who was crippled by Fang Rulong.Qin Li\u2019s eyes were filled with red lines, who yelled, \u201cMaster, I\u2019m grateful for what the Qin Clan had done for me, why would I betray it? I would not ask to be a person with great influence, but at least I would want to live up to my conscience! I, Qin Li, do not have a valuable life, why would I be scared of death? I\u2019m from the Qin Clan to begin with, so I\u2019ll stay with you. Together, we live and we die!.\u201d\\n\u201cTogether, we live and we die!\u201d\u201cTogether, we live and we die!\u201d\u201cTogether, we live and we die!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe words from Qin Li acted like a spell which influenced the remaining disciples of Qin Clan.These disciples had their eyes turned red, and were filled with excitement, no longer terrified of the enemy.At this moment, even though Qin Tieba and his group were shameless enough, their faces burned with shame upon hearing these words.However, they remained on the spot. Isn\u2019t betrayal insignificant compared to saving our own lives?\u201cHAHAHA!\u201d Suddenly, Fang Rulong who was on the platform let out a loud, ear-piercing laugh. His face was twisted, \u201cHow heroic\u2014\u2018live and die together\u2019, very impressive. But who do you think you are? You guys are just a bunch of trash; trash has no right to live and die together. In just a moment\u2019s time, I\u2019ll let you beg for a quick death!\u201dA ferocious aura was emitted from Fang Rulong\u2019s body.Immediately, Fang Rulong looked toward Qin Nan\u2014who had remained silent the whole time\u2014and said in a mocking tone, \u201cI do remember how arrogant you were facing my Fang Clan. However, I\u2019m in no rush to kill you; I would like you to witness me becoming a respectful disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect. Until then, I\u2019ll teach you what it means to be cruel!\u201dUpon saying that, Fang Rulong turned around to face Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng as his twisted expression was replaced by a respectful one.Fang Rulong said, \u201cTwo elders, am I qualified to be a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect? If so, I have a request on becoming a disciple. I hope that you will help me restrain the people of the Qin Clan, so I can kill them all, and show you the power of my Martial Spirit!\u201d\\nThe words caused the atmosphere to become tense.Qin Tian and Tie Shan exchanged gazes. Even though they knew the elimination of the Qin Clan was inevitable, they had decided to sacrifice their lives to protect Qin Nan and the remaining disciples.However, if the two elders decided to interfere, how was it possible for Qin Nan and the disciples to survive?Xiao Qingxue frowned her eyebrows. She was quite impressed with Qin Nan, plus the reactions of the disciples of Qin Clan were acknowledgeable.Now that Fang Rulong said that he planned to kill the remnants of the Qin Clan, how would she agree?Therefore, without hesitation, Xiao Qingxue softly said, \u201cFang Rulong, you are qualified to become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect. Despite that, once you\u2019ve become a disciple, you must avoid these worldly affairs, what\u2019s the point of insisting to kill? It would greatly hinder your pursuit of the Martial Will!\u201d Although it was indirect, but there was no doubt Xiao Qingxue had shown her stance.Upon hearing this, Fang Rulong and Fang Li\u2019s expressions changed. They did not expect Xiao Qingxue to continue protecting Qin Nan and the Qin Clan.Elder Bai Heng\u2019s face turned angry too. He was planning to torture and kill Qin Nan for revenge. How dare you, Xiao Qingxue, still try to protect this trash?Thus, Elder Bai Heng\u2019s tone had no respect, \u201cElder Xiao, I disagree with what you\u2019re saying. Fang Rulong\u2019s Martial Spirit is good for killing. Plus, the Qin Clan and the Fang Clan are enemies. If Qin Clan weren\u2019t to be eliminated, it would affect Junior Fang Rulong\u2019s cultivation, which would not be a good thing. Furthermore, Fang Rulong is now a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect, would it matter if he killed some worldly trash?\u201d\\nEven though Elder Bai Heng was terrified of Xiao Qingxue, it seemed like he was being reasonable.How dare you Xiao Qingxue, protect some worldly people, instead of helping the junior of your sect?If that were said to be the case, it would not be good for Xiao Qingxue\u2019s reputation.A hint of murderous intent appeared in Xiao Qingxue\u2019s eyes, but it was well hidden from the crowd, as she said with a smile, \u201cElder Bai Heng, there\u2019s no need for the sarcasm. I\u2019ll make myself clear. I\u2019m protecting Qin Nan and the Qin Clan. Go ahead and kill them if you have the guts to do so.\u201dXiao Qingxue spoke with a calm tone, and her voice was pleasant to listen to. However, her words were like lightning strikes on a sunny day for Elder Bai Heng, whose expression changed immediately and his forehead started to fill with cold sweat. He did not expect Xiao Qingxue to be so forceful.If Xiao Qingxue really insisted on doing so, Elder Bai Heng would not disobey her will, even if he was given ten guts[1] to do so.Even Fang Rulong and Fang Li had their expressions change again. They did not expect Xiao Qingxue to have such a firm attitude\u2014to protect the Qin Clan, which only had a bunch of trash left.In the meantime, a voice could be heard, \u201cPardon me, elders, I have something to say.\u201dIt was Qin Nan who spoke.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What was Qin Nan planning to do, if he had something to say now?\u201cQin Nan, speak as you will.\u201d Xiao Qingxue\u2019s beautiful face remained calm, as if she did not mind Qin Nan\u2019s sudden interruption.\u201cI have a question for Elder Bai Heng.\u201d Qin Nan gave a humble and respectful look toward Bai Heng, which seemed like he was keen to learn something from him, \u201cElder Bai Heng, is it true that when a person had become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect, that person would be allowed to destroy other Clans at his will? Oh, I mean the ordinary worldly Clans that you just mentioned.\u201dUpon hearing this, Elder Bai Heng\u2019s face twisted slightly and he let out a cold \u2018humph.\u2019 He initially wanted to ignore the question, but on second thought it was better to not make Xiao Qingxue angry, thus he held in his anger and said, \u201cOf course, disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect are highly respected. Worldly people\u2019s deaths are none of our concern.\u201dAfter finishing his sentence, Elder Bai Heng let out a wry smile.Do you\u2014Qin Nan, a trash\u2014really think that you could become a disciple of Mystic Spirit Sect?You, Qin Nan, and the Qin Clan should be more worried about surviving the disaster before you!\u201cI see.\u201d Qin Nan nodded his head as though he had just learned something new.The people at the scene were completely confused about the question. What was Qin Nan thinking?It did not matter what Qin Nan wanted, the people of the Fang Clan had terrible looks on their faces.They originally thought after Fang Rulong had become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect, they would be able to wipe out the Qin Clan. However, they were not sure why Elder Xiao was so fond of the Qin Clan, that she decided to protect them.\\nAlternatively, Qin Tian and Tie Shan were relieved.Even though Qin Tieba and the others had betrayed them, to them, Qin Nan and the remaining disciples surviving was the best ending they could hope for.The ones with complicated feelings were people like Qin Tieba and Qin Changkong.They assumed the Qin Clan would be facing destruction. Hence, they did not hesitate to betray the Qin Clan and join the Fang Clan. Outside of their expectations, they were not sure why the Qin Clan was so lucky as to receive Elder Xiao\u2019s protection to survive this predicament.\u201cLet it be. Since Fang Rulong is definitely going to be selected as the disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect, his future has no limit. Maybe it\u2019s just a spur of the moment that Elder Xiao decided to help the Qin Clan. She won\u2019t be protecting them for eternity\u2014the Qin Clan will still be eliminated.\u201d Qin Tieba and the people with him thought as such.However, Qin Nan was not bothered by the atmosphere, and spoke again, \u201cElder Bai Heng, I\u2019ve one more question that I hope you could answer.\u201dElder Bai Heng frowned his eyebrows and asked in a cold tone, \u201cWhat question?\u201dQin Nan reached out his hand pointing at Fang Rulong and said, \u201cI thought the results of the second round was decided after everyone has shown their Martial Spirit. How come Fang Rulong was selected to be the disciple before me and the other three had shown our Martial Spirit?\u201dHis tone felt like a scold.Following it, Elder Bai Heng was stunned. The people of the Fang Clan were stunned. Even Qin Tian and his followers were stunned.What did the words of Qin Nan mean? Was he arguing that the second round\u2019s trials were unjust?Fang Rulong had released a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. Wasn\u2019t the result of the trial obvious? Did Qin Nan\u2014with a trashy first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014have the confidence to surpass Fang Rulong?\\nWhat a joke.Even Xiao Qingxue slightly frowned her eyebrows. She did not expect Qin Nan to ask about the fairness of the trial after she had spoken out to protect the Qin Clan.Was there any doubts as to the results of the trial?\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Xiao Qingxue said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in continuing the trial. Fang Rulong is indeed qualified to become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect!\u201dWith this statement from Xiao Qingxue, it was assumed that it would be the end. However, out of everyone\u2019s expectation, Qin Nan spoke again.\u201cElder Xiao, I don\u2019t agree with you.\u201d Qin Nan had a calm expression on his face, \u201cThe trial is not over yet. According to the rules, it must be continued. At least until we show our Martial Spirits, then the results can be determined. Now that the trial is not over yet, Fang Rulong is yet to be confirmed as the disciple of Mystic Spirit Sect.\u201dUpon hearing this, everyone was stunned. This Qin Nan dares to talk back to Elder Xiao, is he mad?Doesn\u2019t he know that if not because of Elder Xiao\u2019s words, his Qin Clan would be wiped out? And what do the last few words mean?Is he implying that with Fang Rulong\u2019s sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, he is not worthy enough to be a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect?Qin Tian and Tie San\u2019s expressions changed after hearing the words. Their hearts had dropped into an abyss.The words from Qin Nan were so idiotic!\u201cHAHAHA!\u201d Fang Rulong let out a laugh suddenly, with an excited expression. \u201cWell said, what Qin Nan said is right. The trial is not over yet. My sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit is not confirmed to be the highest grade yet. Elder Xiao, I do request the trial to be continued.\u201d\\nElder Bai Heng collected his thoughts as well as he smilingly said, \u201cYes, the trial should indeed be continued, if not it would be a huge loss if we were to miss better talents. Plus, the trials must be fair.\u201dThe two worked well together with one sentence each.It was because Fang Rulong and Elder Bai Heng were extremely happy. They were forced to keep their anger to themselves and were not allowed to do anything to Qin Nan and his people under Xiao Qingxue\u2019s protection.However, now that Qin Nan had gone against Xiao Qingxue with those stupid words, why would Xiao Qingxue continue to look after him?That\u2019s impossible!Hence, Qin Nan had sentenced himself to death with his own words.If Qin Nan was looking for a death trip, Bai Heng and Fang Rulong would be happy to send him on the journey!As expected, Xiao Qingxue\u2019s expression was unpleasant. She initially had admired Qin Nan\u2019s firm character, but now she knew now the young lad was being stupid and ignorant, instead of being courageous.Continue the Martial Spirit Trial just to be fair?Whose Martial Spirit would be better than Fang Rulong\u2019s?He is no doubt embarrassing himself.\u201cFIne.\u201d Xiao Qingxue gave a displeased look toward Qin Nan and said, \u201cSince you prefer to be fair, then I\u2019ll give it to you. I would like to see what the Martial Spirit you have awakened looks like.\u201dThe words made Fang Rulong, Bai Heng, and their faction grow even more excited.As they expected, because of Qin Nan\u2019s idiotic behavior, Xiao Qingxue was no longer fond of him. If that was the case, then she would not protect him anymore.Without Xiao Qingxue\u2019s protection, what would Qin Nan considered to be? A trash, an ant.\u201cHAHAHA!\u2019 Elder Bai Heng laughed out loud with joy, and then waved his hand, \u201cLet the trial continue. Remaining contestants, please show us your Martial Spirit! I\u2019m curious to see if there\u2019s any Martial Spirit higher than the sixth-grade!\u201d\\nUpon hearing the words of Elder Bai Heng, the two Qin Clan disciples who had advanced to the second round had no intention of disobeying. They took turns to release their Martial Spirits, which were both fourth-grade.In just a brief period, among the five people who advanced, Qin Nan was the only one left.\u201cQin Nan, what are you waiting for? Show us your trash Martial Spirit now.\u201d Fang Rulong was filled with pride, and raised his head while looking down at Qin Nan, \u201cYou\u2019re merely a first-grade Huang ranked trash. I have no idea where you get your confidence from, to ask for a fair trial? Furthermore, you even said that I\u2019m not confirmed to be the disciple yet, didn\u2019t you? Show me the reason which made you daring enough to say such thing.\u201dSince the series of events had escalated into such a situation, Fang Rulong decided not to conceal his anger anymore and mocked his rival.Elder Bai Heng and the others were excited too.As Qin Tieba and his crew saw that the situation had changed, they directed their insults at Qin Nan.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this? We have already witnessed Qin Nan\u2019s first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.\u201d\u201cHAHAHA, I think his Martial Spirit was a sword, a first-grade Huang ranked sword.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s definitely embarrassing himself. I think Elder Xiao Qingxue will no longer help him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe whole place was filled with countless mocks and gloats.They could not be blamed for this. The main reason for it was that Qin Nan was initially safe under Xiao Qingxue\u2019s protection, and was able to save himself. However, instead of keeping quiet, he spoke out wildly.Did you, Qin Nan, really think that you could alter the situation with your first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?\\nXiao Qingxue shook her head slightly, her eyes filled with disappointment.She admired people who were honest, unyielding, and loyal, not people who were stubborn, arrogant, and presumptuous. There was a big difference between the two.In Xiao Qingxue\u2019s mind now, Qing Nan was no doubt classified as the later type.Despite that, Qin Nan started to smile at this moment.His smile was frivolous, prideful, and imperious, as if nothing in his vision was worthy of his attention.\u201cDo you know how long I have waited for today?\u201d Qin Nan said with an honest tone while looking at his father Qin Tian and Tie Shan.He then turned toward the people of the Fang Clan and Qin Tieba and his crew, and said, \u201cDo you also know I have been waiting for today?\u201dFollowing this, he raised his head looking at Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng and said, \u201cTwo elders, do you have any idea how long I have waited for this?\u201dThe same sentence was repeated three times; as the last sentence was finished, an aura rose up from Qin Nan\u2019s back.A dominating aura was emitted together with bright golden rays. An enormous yet blurry outline of an ancient human figure appeared floating behind Qin Nan, staring down at the ground.Divine Battle Spirit\u2014unleashed!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was glad that the remaining disciples were insistent on staying, even when their lives were at stake when the Qin Clan faced destruction.The only unexpected thing was Xiao Qingxue speaking out to protect the Qin Clan.Even though Qin Nan was grateful for her actions, he decided to interfere. He would never allow his Qin Clan to be bullied by the Fang Clan before him. He was going to make the Fang Clan pay for what they had done to the Qin Clan!As a result, Qin Nan stepped out and released his Martial Spirit!At this moment, six golden rays were seen behind Qin Nan, together with the phantom-like appearance of the Divine Battle Spirit, which shocked the crowd with its marvelous aura.In that instant, the crowd fell into silence, with wide open eyes and stunned expressions on everyone\u2019s face.Six golden rays, Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit had six golden rays\u2026 Is this implying that Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit is sixth-grade Huang ranked?How\u2026 How is this possible?\\nIsn\u2019t Qin Nan\u2019s a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? Why does it appear to be a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?The place was so quiet, as if a large vacuum had appeared. No one was talking, the scene before them was too shocking.Especially for Qin Tieba and his group, whose minds had gone blank from the shock.They had witnessed Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit to be first-grade Huang ranked previously\u2026 But how was the one he showed a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?Why\u2026 Why is this happening?\u201cHow is this possible!\u201d Fang Rulong was the first one to break the silence after the shock, who went insane, \u201cHow come you have a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? The people of the Qin Clan witnessed your Martial Spirit during the awakening ceremony. It was just a first-grade Huang ranked trash! You were just trash\u2026\u201d\u201cShut it.\u201dA respectful voice said, spreading around the whole area.The one speaking was Xiao Qingxue.A smile had appeared like a blossom of the flowers on her face, replacing her shocked expression from before.At this moment, Xiao Qingxue finally understood why Qin Nan was daring enough to mercilessly kill the talents of the Fang Clan even when they had the support of Bai Heng. She also understood why Qin Nan asked for a fair trial, and why he had been so calm all this time.It was all because Qin Nan had a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, and he had reached the \u2018Greater Success Stage\u2019 of \u2018One with the Weapons\u2019, plus a cultivation base of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm! These were all the sources of his confidence.Xiao Qingxue did not care if the Martial Spirit that Qin Nan had initially awakened was a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. She only knew that currently, Qin Nan\u2019s talent was more eye-catching than Fang Rulong\u2019s.\\n\u201cThis guy, he\u2019s pretty good at hiding it.\u201d Xiao Qingxue complained in her mind, but she was no doubt very happy, as she broke the silence by saying, \u201cElder Bai heng, I now think that Qin Nan is more qualified to be selected as the disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect. What do you think?\u201dUpon hearing this, Bai Heng instantly collected his thoughts from the shock, and looking at the situation before him; his face had a terrible expression as if he had just eaten something filthy.How come Qin Nan has a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit? What is going on here?After hearing the words, everyone had finally awoken from the shock. Although their minds were still filled with shock and doubts, they clearly understood that Qin Nan had surpassed Fang Rulong and become the disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect.Fang Li and the people of the Fang Clan had their faces turned pale while.Qin Tieba\u2014together with Qin Changkong and their faction\u2014appeared pale white too. They never expected a genius to appear in the Qin Clan they had just betrayed.Furthermore, this genius was Qin Nan, who kept getting mocked by them!In contrast, Qin Tian and Tie San were still only half-conscious from the shock. It felt like a dream to witness what just happened. How did the former-trash suddenly become a genius?\u201cI refuse to believe!\u201d Fang Rulong screamed suddenly. A ferocious aura was emitting from his body as he roared, \u201cWhy is Qin Nan being selected as a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect? He is only trash. He probably cheated just now to make his Martial Spirit have such a high grade. He sure doesn\u2019t have a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit..\u201dXiao Qingxue slightly frowned her eyebrowns. Her eyes looked at Fang Rulong, filled with iciness.\\nDespite that, Qin Nan\u2014who had brought along this series of shocks\u2014started to talk, \u201cFang Rulong, you\u2019re not convinced right?\u201dAs Fang Rulong switched his gaze onto Qin Nan, he felt like he had just seen his greatest enemy. His eyes were red, as he roared with his body\u2019s strength, \u201cYes, I\u2019m not convinced! You\u2019re just trash! You\u2019ll never be a genius! You\u2019re a piece of trash and you know it. You\u2019re trash, forever trash\u2026\u201dIn that moment, it felt like Fang Rulong had gone completely mad.It was because Qin Nan was initially an ant. How was it that, suddenly, he became so powerful\u2014even more powerful than him, Fang Rulong?Thus, Fang Rulong went crazy!\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll let you believe it!\u201d Qin Nan let out a wry smile and the aura on his body grew rapidly once again. Among the initial golden rays of the Divine Battle Spirit, appeared another golden ray, which made seven in total now.An invisible sense of power was felt from Qin Nan\u2019s body.Everyone was stunned again, including Xiao Qingxue, whose face had a shocked expression on it.Seven Golden Rays\u2026 Seventh-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit is not sixth-grade Huang ranked, but a seventh-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?Fang Rulong who had gone mad, was completely stunned with a pair of unfocused eyes, as if he did not know what had just happened.What on Earth is happening? How did a first-grade Huang ranked trash now turn into a seventh-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking? I\u2019ll ask you again, are you convinced?\u201dQin Nan let out a loud roar, and the previous seven Golden Rays shone brightly in this moment. The eighth golden ray was rising slowly and emitted light. The pressure from the Divine Battle Spirit was increased exponentially.\\nDivine Battle Spirit, completely unleashed!\u201cNow tell me\u2026 Are you convinced?\u201d Qin Nan said in a casual tone.Fang Rulong was completely shocked; his brain went blank, unable to answer any Qin Nan\u2019s question.Not only him, everyone at the scene found their minds empty, their souls experiencing endless shocks.It is indeed eight golden rays\u2026 The Martial Spirit that Qin Nan possess has eight golden rays\u2026 Does this mean Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit has reached eighth-grade Huang ranked?Shua!Xiao Qingxue rose from her seat quickly\u2014her beautiful eyes opened wide\u2014and said in a shocked tone, \u201cHuang ranked\u2026 eighth-grade?\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 -Turning the TablesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32 -Turning the TablesIn Xiao Qingxue\u2019s view, a sixth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit could only be somewhat admired.However, an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was enough to heavily capture her attention.An eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, how significant was that?Even in the Mystic Spirit Sect, a person with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit would be considered one of the top talents.For example, Xiao Qingxue\u2019s own was an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.\u201cQin Nan, you\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingxue was indeed one of the top talents of the Mystic Spirit Sect, as she was able to calm herself down quickly, but a hint of a grudge could be seen in her eyes as she said, \u201cYou\u2026 You are pretty good at concealing it!\u201dQin Nan smiled and said while holding his fists together, \u201cElder Xiao, I was not purposely hiding it, I hope you understand. Besides that\u2026 Elder Xiao, with my current Martial Spirit\u2019s grade, am I qualified as a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect?\u201dUpon hearing this, Xiao Qingxue let go of her grudge and faced the crowd, before saying in a loud voice, \u201cWe are only accepting one disciple in this Mystic Spirit Sect Disciple Recruitment Ceremony. Now, as an outer elder of the Mystic Spirit Sect, I declare Qin Nan to be the champion of the trials, and also an outer disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect!\u201dThe words were accompanied by a fearsome aura, which covered the area like an explosion.It awakened most of the crowd who had lost their thoughts from the endless stream of shocks.Despite that, Qin Tian, Tie San, and the others still had blank expressions on their faces, yet to recover from the shock.On the other hand, Bai Heng\u2019s face was pale white.\\nThe faces of Fang Rulong, Fang Li, and the people of the Fang Clan were pale too.The faces of Qin Changkong, Qin Tieba, and their crew were even paler.Qin Tian and Tie San\u2019s group were still confused, because they were unable to make sense of why Qin Nan\u2014who was initially a first-grade Huang ranked trash\u2014had turned into a top genius with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, and was now a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect.As regards Bai Heng, Fang Rulong, Fang Li, Qin Changkong, Qin Tieba, and the others; they now realized they had offended someone who they could not afford to offend at all.An eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, one that only existed in the legends; whoever had it was known as the real one in a million genius!The only one to be selected as the outer disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect in Lingshui City!Offending someone with either identity was unwise.However, they had seriously offended Qin Nan.They mocked him, bullied him, and had even tried to kill him on multiple occasions\u2026 Would the current Qin Nan let them go?A smile appeared on Qin Nan\u2019s face, who gently brought his fists together in a gesture toward Xiao Qingxue, expressing his gratitude.Immediately after, Qin Nan\u2019s eyes looked toward Bai Heng on the platform and said, \u201cElder Bai Heng, I did ask you before; is it fine for a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect to kill some ordinary worldly people?\u201d\u201cErr\u2026\u201d Bai Heng hesitated at the sudden question, but he quickly reacted by nodding his head like a chick pecking the rice on the ground, and said, \u201cYes yes yes, that is the case. Junior Brother Qin, do you have any worldly enemies? You can tell me straightaway; I\u2019ll help you to deal with them. Even though my cultivation base is not that high, it is more than enough to eliminate these worldly people!\u201d\\nIn an instant, Bai Heng had completely abandoned the Fang Clan, and said the words with a flattering tone. It was not Bai Heng\u2019s fault; the main reason was that an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was simply too overwhelming.The others might be clueless, but Bai Heng knew clearly that since Qin Nan had awakened an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, Qin Nan\u2019s status would be higher than his own once he joined the Mystic Spirit Sect.This was because the Martial Spirit that Bai Heng possessed was only sixth-grade Huang ranked.As a result, with Qin Nan\u2019s current identity, dealing with Bai Heng would be as easy as pie.Between a rare talent eighth-grade Huang ranked disciple and an ordinary sixth-grade Huang ranked disciple, his sect would definitely choose the former and abandon the latter.\u201cYou have my thanks, Elder Bai Heng.\u201d Qin Nan smiled gently, and he did not reject Elder Bai Heng\u2019s offer.Even though in Qin Nan\u2019s heart, Bai Heng was included in the \u2018must-kill\u2019 list, since Bai Heng was a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect, along with the fact that his cultivation had reached the peak of the Xiantian Realm, Qin Nan was unable to defeat him with his current capabilities.Hence, Qin Nan decided to take his time to deal with Bai Heng after he had arrived at the Mystic Spirit Sect.Qin Nan then looked toward the people of the Fang Clan and said, \u201cYou Fang Clan know clearly what has happened today. Now, I would like the Fang Clan to give me a satisfying resolution!\u201dFang Rulong, Fang Li, and their crew found themselves shivering, as fear grew unreigned in their hearts.Resolution? What could they do?The fact of the matter was that they had made a deal with Elder Bai Heng to forcefully threaten the Qin Clan. They even turned most of the people of the Qin Clan into betrayers after Fang Rulong showed his Martial Spirit\u2026 If Qin Nan did not show his authority suddenly, their Fang Clan would have wiped out the Qin Clan on the spot.\\nWhat resolution was possible to settle such deep hatred between the two clans?In that moment, Fang Rulong, Fang Li, and the others could only stare at Qin Nan with begging eyes.They knew in their hearts that the fate of the Fang Clan\u2014together with their lives\u2014would be determined by Qin Nan\u2019s decision.\u201cYoung Master Qin Nan!\u201d Suddenly, a loud voice was heard, which continued, \u201cThe Fang Clan should not be spared! Before when the Fang Clan was threatening us, I betrayed the Qin Clan and joined them. Since then, I had the thought to wait for the right time to avenge the Qin Clan! Who could have thought you, Young Master Qin Nan, would stand out in the end\u2026\u201dNo one had expected the one talking to be Qin Changkong.Qin Changkong was dancing around, his face bright red while he said these words, as if every single word wasn\u2019t insincere. Everyone was stunned; how was it possible that there was such a shameless person in the world?When he saw this, Qin Nan let out a sudden laugh\u2014an icy cold laugh\u2014as he said, \u201cShut your mouth.\u201dSince Qin Nan still had his eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit unleashed, every single word of his was accompanied by a powerful and imperious pressure.As the three words were spoken, Qin Changkong\u2019s expression changed immediately; he felt like an invisible mountain was pressing down onto his body, rendering him unable to speak any longer.Qin Nan then stared at Qin Changkong, Qin Tieba, and their group of people with a pair of icy cold eyes, as he said, \u201cNow, there is no point of explaining anything to me. I already knew that you were trying to overthrow my father\u2014which I did advise you not to do. Furthermore, when disciples of the Qin Clan were being crippled, not only did you not rescue them, but you instead chose to fawn over Bai Heng\u2026 And finally, when the Qin Clan was under threat from the Fang Clan, you chose to betray the Qin Clan and join the Fang Clan without any hesitation\u2026 You have to understand, from that moment onward\u2014all of you were no longer a part of the Qin Clan!\u201d\\nWhen they listened to the words, Qin Changkong, Qin Tieba, and the others\u2019 faces turned dull, filled with regrets.Previously in the Qin Clan, Qin Changkong\u2014who thought he was the top genius, after awakening a fifth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014kept on mocking and annoying Qin Nan. He even participated in his father\u2019s plan to overthrow Qin Tian.Qin Changkong and Qin Tieba finally realized how laughable their actions were.They dared to call a genius with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit trash?They dared to oppose a genius with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit on multiple occasions?It was not only Qin Changkong and Qin Tieba, but the deacons and elders of the Qin Clan were also full of regrets too.Previously at the Qin Clan, Qin Nan had already advised them in the Conference Hall, but none of them had listened.They had treated Qin Nan as trash, as a waste!Furthermore, what made Qin Changkong, Qin Tieba, and the people even more regretful was that\u2014when they were facing the threats of Fang Clan\u2014they didn\u2019t choose to stay in the Qin Clan? Why didn\u2019t they choose not to surrender even if it meant death?If they had not betrayed the Qin Clan, it was possible that Qin Nan would have spared their lives because of their identities as part of the Qin Clan\u2026However, being regretful was not at all helpful in this world.They could only blame themselves for bullying the weak, fawning upon the strong, and being extremely scared of death.Qin Nan gave an expressionless look at the Fang Clan and Qin Tieba\u2019s group, as he said, \u201cYou all must forfeit your cultivation and leave Lingshui City. I\u2019ll give you time it takes three incenses to burn to do so. If you don\u2019t do so in the given period, I will show no mercy. If anyone disagrees, you can come up here now, and I\u2019ll grant you a quick death!\u201d\\nEvery single sentence was filled with heavy murderous intent!The people of the Fang Clan together with Qin Tieba, Qin Changkong, and the others had dull expressions on their faces, as they lowered their heads.They had no other choice; in fact, Qin Nan\u2019s suggestion was the best outcome for them.At least, their lives would be spared.At the same time, from today onward, the Qin Clan had become the real powerhouse of Lingshui City\u2014with no opponents left!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Below them were the remaining disciples of the Qin Clan and Qin Nan.Qin Tian\u2019s face was fully red, as if he was extremely drunk, when he said, \u201cWho could have thought\u2026who could have thought that I, Qin Tian, have a genius son\u2026\u201dTie San and the disciples were not bothered by it; the excitement on their faces showed no sign of disappearing.In their view, what happened today was too unreal, as if they were all having a dream.Initially, Qin Tian, Tie San, and the disciples had anticipated the fall of the Qin Clan, and their own deaths. Beyond their expectations, Qin Nan\u2019s sudden appearance like a Divine Battle God had ended up turning the tables around!Not only that, it was unimaginable what kind of future awaited the Qin Clan.Xiao Qingxue, who was sitting at the side, let out a gentle smile after hearing the words. Then\u2014after something came to her\u2014she asked curiously, \u201cOh right, Qin Nan, didn\u2019t they mention that your Martial Spirit was just first-grade Huang ranked? What\u2019s really happening?\u201d\\nXiao Qingxue\u2019s question had caused Bai Heng, Qin Tian, Tie San, and the others to perk up their ears and look at Qin Nan excitedly.It was evident that Xiao Qingxue had asked the same question that they were curious about.How had Qin Nan turned from a first-grade Huang ranked trash into an eighth-grade Huang ranked genius?Qin Nan let out a smile\u2014as he had thought of an excuse for it\u2014and said, \u201cWhen I was young, I was struck by a lightning. When this happened, a special technique appeared in my mind. This technique does not have any uses apart from being able to conceal my Martial Spirit\u2019s grade. That is why the Martial Spirit they saw during the Martial Spirit Awakening Ceremony appeared to be a first-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit!\u201cConcealing a Martial Spirit\u2019s grade?\u201dThe crowd came to an understanding, surprisingly without further doubts.There was such a thing as good fortune and there were many mysterious things to be discovered in this world. To find such a special technique after being struck by a lightning was not impossible at all.Furthermore, they were unable to come up with any other explanations apart from this one.To find the unowned Divine Battle Spirit drop from the sky\u2014which has the capability of levelling up its grade some more\u2014was extremely unbelievable.\u201cDoes that mean your cultivation was not improved due to any special circumstances, but was a result of your practice?\u201d Qin Tian asked suddenly.\u201cYeah, I did not stumble upon any good fortune\u2014it was all from my practice.\u201d Qin Nan nodded his head, and continued with an apologetic tone, \u201cI stumbled upon Fang Xue in the Longhu Mountain Range; that\u2019s how I learned about the Fang Clan\u2019s evil plot, and came up with a plan to keep my Martial Spirit a secret\u2026 I hope you all can understand the reason I did this.\u201d\\n\u201cNot a problem.\u201d Bai Heng immediately answered, \u201cJunior Brother Qin\u2019s talent is remarkable, who cares about the insignificant Fang Clan? I, Bai Heng, have made a mistake this time after being tricked by the people of the Fang Clan. If Junior Brother Qin had told me beforehand, I would have eliminated the Fang Clan straightaway, without a second word.\u201dWhile Bai Heng was apologizing, he did not forget to secretly flatter Qin Nan too.Qin Nan responded with a gentle smile.Qin Nan tended to hold grudges; thus, despite Bai Heng\u2019s flattering words, Qin Nan would still deal with him when the time came.\u201cQin Nan, now that you\u2019ve become an outer disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect, there\u2019s something I have to remind you of.\u201d As she switched her expression into a serious one, Xiao Qingxue continued, \u201cIn two days\u2019 time, you need to have finished everything you need to do. Then, you\u2019ll follow me to the Mystic Spirit Sect, as time is running out.\u201dWhen he heard this, Qin Tian immediately replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to wait another two days. Qin Nan, you will leave tomorrow and follow Elder Xiao toward the Mystic Spirit Sect. Don\u2019t you worry, no one would dare to offend the Qin Clan now!\u201dAfter finishing this sentence, a proud expression appeared on Qin Tian\u2019s face.Tie San and the other disciples nodded their heads in agreement, with proud expressions on their faces too.In Lingshui City\u2014or even in the whole Luo River Kingdom\u2014who would dare to go against the current Qin Clan?Qin Nan took a deep breath, and said in a serious tone while looking at Qin Tian, Tie San, and the disciples, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll not stay any longer. Father, Uncle San, you guys, take care of yourselves. Once I\u2019ve joined the Mystic Spirit Sect, I promise to visit you guys whenever I have the time!\u201d\\nUpon hearing this, Qin Tian, Tie San, and the others let out grateful smiles.With Qin Tian having Qin Nan as his son\u2014with the Qin Clan having a genius like Qin Nan\u2014how could they be not satisfied?\u201cIt\u2019s decided then. You should give the two elders a tour around our Qin Clan.\u201d Qin Tian said, while waving his hand. Since Qin Nan had just become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect, it was necessary to build a good relationship with Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng.\u201cI\u2019ll stay here. With my cultivation base and my experience, I believe I\u2019m capable enough to lead a friendly discourse about cultivation with you guys\u2026\u201d Bai Heng said immediately.Qin Nan nodded his head without saying a word, and left the Conference Hall, following after Xiao Qingxue.Xiao Qingxue, who was in front of Qin Nan, was walking elegantly with a pair of beautiful eyes that looked around at the sights of the Qin Clan. However, her side gaze was focused onto Qin Nan.The sights of the Qin Clan were insignificant in her opinion.But Xiao Qingxue was quite interested in Qin Nan, who continued to give her surprises.It was Qin Nan\u2019s first time to be alone with a young and beautiful lady, which made him feel unnatural, as he said with a wry smile, \u201cSenior Sister Xiao, why do you keep staring at me\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you would feel embarrassed.\u201d Xiao Qingxue covered her mouth as she laughed, and then said, \u201cDon\u2019t call me Senior Sister, that\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s ok to call me Qingxue.\u201dQin Nan was slightly stunning while he looked at her blossoming smile, \u201cUhh\u2026\u201d\u201cBy the way, Qin Nan, you mentioned you acquired a special technique that is capable of concealing your Martial Spirit grade, right?\u201d Xiao Qingxue asked.\\n\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cTell me then, is your Martial Spirit only eighth-grade Huang ranked? Or are you hiding something?\u201d Xiao Qingxue\u2019s beautiful eyes appeared to be glittering.Qin Nan was surprised, but quickly answered with a hollow laugh, \u201cWhy would I hide it if I had a stronger Martial Spirit?\u201dXiao Qingxue was going to refute this answer instinctively, but she ended up nodding her head without continuing the topic, with a sense of regret in her heart.An eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was considered extremely powerful. It was already rare for Qin Nan to have such a highly-graded Martial Spirit. Why would she think Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit would surpass eighth-grade Huang ranked? It was clearly impossible.Despite that, what Xiao Qingxue did not know was that in just a few breaths\u2019 time, Qin Nan\u2019s heart rate had doubled, his forehead covered in a new cold sweat. Qin Nan did not expect Xiao Qingxue to have such a sharp instinct.There was no doubt that the potential of the Divine Battle Spirit had surpassed the eighth-grade Huang rank. As a matter of fact, eighth-grade Huang rank was just the beginning for the Divine Battle Spirit.\u201cWhy are you sweating?\u201d Xiao Qingxue caught a glimpse of the sweat on Qin Nan\u2019s forehead, but instead of pursuing for an answer, she said in a serious tone, \u201cQin Nan, do remember that even though you have an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, you should not be full of yourself in the Mystic Spirit Sect and be arrogant. You must focus on cultivation; if not, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201dWhen she said this, Xiao Qingxue hesitated for a brief moment, before saying in a soft voice, \u201cYou have to know, there\u2019s no such thing as a limit\u2014there will be someone out there who\u2019s better than you. The Mystic Spirit Sect is only the beginning in this Canglan Continent.\u201d\\nQin Nan was stunned at these words;he nodded his head heavily.Qin Nan stayed at the Qin Clan for another day, despite Qin Tian\u2019s advice. In the second day\u2019s morning, he then departed for the Mystic Spirit Sect, together with Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng.However, something unexpected happened as he prepared to leave Lingshui City.On the walls of the city stood Qin Tian, Tie San, and the disciples of the Qin Clan.Apart from that, countless cultivators from Lingshui City appeared rapidly like a flowing stream and gathered around the Qin Clan. In just half the time it took an incense to burn, there was more than ten thousand people, which appeared like a wall made of humans when seen from afar.Everyone from Lingshui City had come to bid him farewell.Qin Nan was stunned at the scene, \u201cFather\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cQin Nan, these cultivators of Lingshui City were not summoned by me\u2014they came voluntarily to wish you a safe journey!\u201d Qin Tian shouted, his face showing his pride.The cultivators of Lingshui City behind Qin Tian were all excitedly looking at Qin Nan, as if Qin Nan was their king in their minds.In their minds, Qin Nan was no longer merely a genius\u2014he was a real legend!Hence, they had all come to bid him farewell, shouting continuously.\u201cYoung Master Qin Nan, bon voyage!\u201d\u201cHAHA, Young Master Qin Nan, remember to look after us once you\u2019ve become a powerful cultivator.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling my son that Young Master Qin Nan should be his role model!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Qin Nan, we await your grand return!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Tian appeared to be influenced by the emotions of the cultivators of Lingshui City; as he was looking at Qin Nan from afar, a mixture of sadness\u2014from the separation\u2014and some other complicated feelings were felt in his heart. He then yelled out, \u201cQin Nan, you must remember\u2014 you are Qin Tian\u2019s son. Your future is to become a champion. Therefore, you must not give up, you must not afraid. Taking a step at a time, you will walk toward your success!\u201d\\nWhen he witnessed what was happening on the walls of the city\u2014and as he listened to the words of his father and these fellow strangers\u2014his heart was suddenly filled with a sense of accomplishment.Qin Nan nodded his head heavily, and then turned around and started walking.He did not say a word. The only thing left to see was the view of his back, as he continued with firm steps.Qin Nan was not good at expressing himself. This was his only way of expressing his promise. His promise toward Qin Tian, toward Qin Clan, and also toward the people who had high expectations of him.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We will arrive in roughly nine days\u2019 time.\u201d Bai Heng said to Qin Nan, as they arrived at a valley after a day\u2019s journey.\u201cNine days? If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll be cultivating during the journey.\u201d Qin Nan nodded his head and unleashed his Divine Battle Spirit, which started to absorb all the Qi from the surroundings.Beside him, Bai Heng was staring at him in disbelief, with a sense of jealousy rising in his mind, together with a hint of fear.An Eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit is terrifying indeed.Xiao Qingxue frowned her eyebrows slightly, and said with her pleasant voice, \u201cQin Nan, it\u2019s no use to cultivate like this. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re at the Body-Tempering Realm, Xiantian Realm, or even the Martial Emperor Realm, as long as you are cultivating, you must be calm at all times. If you cultivate as you are walking, you will exert your Qi which you have just absorbed\u2014hence, hindering the Body-Tempering effect.\u201d\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d Qin Nan was secretly impressed. Xiao Qingxue had indeed reached the Martial Emperor Realm with her cultivation as she had substantial experience in cultivation.There was no sign of improvement when he tried to cultivate just now after unleashing his Divine Battle Spirit\u2014it was exactly as she had mentioned.\u201cWhen I observed your battle last time, it seemed like you had not learned any movement technique.\u201d Xiao Qingxue let out an attractive smile, which stunned Qin Nan and Bai Heng instantly. \u201cI happen to have a skill book of an ultimate martial skill here called \u2018Mystical Eight Steps\u2019\u2014here, take it and have a look.\u201d\u201cAn ultimate martial skill?\u201d Qin Nan was shocked as he looked at the skill book before him. He hesitated as he hadn\u2019t expected Xiao Qingxue to be so generous.\\n\u201cCome and take it, what are you waiting for?\u201d Xiao Qingxue batted her eyes at Qin Nan.When he saw such ladylike behavior of Xiao Qingxue, Qin Nan felt his heart skipped a beat; he then had to force himself to calm down as he reached out his hand to receive the skill book.In the meantime, Qin Nan swore in his heart that he would pay back Xiao Qingxue\u2019s good deed one day.Not to mention during the previous Disciple Recruitment Ceremony, Xiao Qingxue had lent a hand to help Qin Nan\u2014who was considered \u2018trash\u2019\u2014and protected the Qin Clan at the same time. Now, she had given him a skill book of an ultimate martial skill; all these were merely from her friendliness.Beside him, Bai Heng appeared to be more jealous of him; it\u2019s more than enough for this Qin Nan to have such talent\u2014he is even winning Xiao Qingxue\u2019s favor.One has to know that even the top talents of the Mystic Spirit Sect failed to win Xiao Qingxue\u2019s favor!What kind of good fortune has this Qin Nan stumbled upon?Meanwhile, Xiao Qingxue continued, and said, \u201cQin Nan, remember this. When facing your opponents with martial arts, there are two basic rules; first is the offensive skills, second is the speed.\u201cNow that you\u2019ve mastered the Great Success Stage of One with the Saber, your offensive ability when facing opponents with the same cultivation base is considered overwhelming. Therefore, you should focus on practicing this \u2018Mystical Eight Steps\u2019 to improve your speed\u2026\u201dQin Nan kept nodding his head while listening to the advice; even Bai Heng had lifted his ears too. It was a precious chance to receive advice on cultivation from a Martial Emperor Realm cultivator.Moments later, the three decided to rest at a spot in a small jungle so that Qin Nan would have some time to learn \u2018Mystical Eight Steps\u2019.\\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what kind of sorcery this \u2018Mystical Eight Steps\u2019 possesses.\u201d Qin Nan held the skill book in his hand with a pair of fiery eyes focusing on it. He then turned the pages one by one and started reading it. He completely lost himself in the process\u2014as if he were drunk\u2014and found himself in his own world, separated from reality.Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng were stunned as they looked at Qin Nan; after this, a hint of surprise appeared in their eyes.Xiao Qingxue\u2019s eyes turned fiery and flashed as she said, \u201cNever did I think that Qin Nan would be so interested in martial skills. In just a breath\u2019s time, he has entered his own world and achieved a status of One with the Mind\u2014even I have trouble reaching that in such a short time.\u201dWhen he heard this, Bai Heng didn\u2019t feel pleasant, but he did not know the actual reason behind this.Why is this Qin Nan so good in other areas, after already having an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?Plus he had to put himself in a groveling stance in front of Qin Nan, which further made him annoyed\u2014although he was not daring enough to show it on his face.\u201cI have to come up with a plan to release my hatred; I\u2019m an outer elder of the Mystic Spirit Sect, there\u2019s no way I would allow this to continue\u2026\u201d Bai Heng thought to himself, his eyes rolling around, before finally emitting a flash as he thought of something.Bai Heng smiled while he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know Senior Sister Xiao had such a high remark toward Junior Brother Qin Nan. Senior Sister Xiao, since we have some time to spare\u2014which could be boring\u2014why not let\u2019s have a bet?\u201d\u201cA bet?\u201d Xiao Qingxue gave him a quick glance.\\nBai Heng nodded his head and said, \u201cNow that Junior Brother Qin Nan is learning Mystical Eight Steps, let\u2019s bet on the time he needs to finish the process, how about that? We\u2019ll both come up with a timeframe separately, and the one with the closest answer will be the winner.\u201dThe words made Xiao Qingxue slightly intrigued, who said, \u201cPretty interesting for a bet. I\u2019ll bet one hundred Xiantian Pills then.\u201d\u201cA hundred Xiantian Pills?\u201d Bai Heng\u2019s expression changed slightly from these words.Xiantian Pills and Body Tempering Pills were the same. It was evident from the name that it was a pill used by cultivators who had reached the Xiantian Realm to aid in their cultivation.However, Xiantian Pills were relatively expensive. One Xiantian Pill\u2019s value was equivalent to a hundred Body Tempering Pills, and normally it would be out of stock on the market, not available to be traded.Even for Bai Heng, to give away a hundred Xian Tian Pills was quite a huge loss.\u201cFine, that will be our bet.\u201d Bai Heng clenched his teeth as he made his decision and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take the first guess. If I were to learn this \u2018Mystical Eight Steps\u2019, I would need at least three days. However, since Junior Brother Qin Nan possesses an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014plus he\u2019s able to go into the stance of One with the Mind\u2014then the time needed would be greatly reduced. I\u2019ll guess a day!\u201dAfter finishing his sentence, Bai Heng gave a confident smile.The reason he was willing to commit to the bet was he had met a top genius who had an eighth-ranked Martial Spirit, and was able to go into the stance of One with the Mind too when he was learning martial skills.From his experience, the time needed for the genius to finish learning the martial skill was exactly a day\u2019s time.\\nTherefore, Bai Heng was confident to commit one hundred Xiantian Pills for the bet.When she heard this, Xiao Qingxue frowned her eyebrows slightly. From the calculation in her mind, she was expecting it to take around a day too. However, since Bai Heng had already guessed a day, she was not allowed to have the same answer.After coming to such a realization, Xiao Qingxue raised her head to look at Qin Nan who was immersed in the learning process; she thought of the series of shocking events which took place during the Disciple Recruitment Ceremony, then said, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll guess 11 hours!\u201dAfter hearing this, Bai Heng almost leapt into the air in excitement.Eleven hours, to learn an ultimate martial skill?Even a genius with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, when entered into the stance of \u2018One with the Mind\u2019 would need eleven hours to learn an ultimate martial skill.How is Qin Nan comparable to a ninth-grade Huang ranked genius?Xiao Qingxue did know all this, but for some reasons she was not sure of, she was ultimately confident in Qin Nan.Let\u2019s hope you can bring a miracle\u2026 Xiao Qingxue prayed in her heart, while focusing her flashing eyes onto Qin Nan.After that, Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng sat down and meditated, and immersed themselves in cultivation. It would take some time for the martial skill learning process to finish.Time passed slowly; suddenly, at the five hours mark, an aura was emitted from Qin Nan who was in the stance of \u2018One with the Mind\u2019.Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng immediately sensed the aura\u2014they opened their eyes in shock.Could it be? Had Qin Nan learned the martial skill in only five hours\u2019 time?Following this, the aura from Qin Nan rapidly decayed, and the atmosphere was calm once again.\\nXiao Qingxue and Bai Heng collected their thoughts and lightly shook their heads.Five hours to finish learning \u2018Mystical Eight Steps\u2019? Even a tenth-grade Huang ranked super-genius is unable to do so, how is it possible for Qin Nan?Despite that, Qin Nan rose from the ground instantly and closed the skill book, his face filled with excitement, \u201cSuch an incredible ultimate martial skill. It took me five hours to master its foundation\u2026 Hmm? Qingxue, why are you both having such expressions?\u201dQin Nan was curious, why did both Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng have stiff expressions on their faces?Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng had their hearts full of shock.Had Qin Nan actually done it? Something that even a tenth-grade Huang ranked super genius could not do?Bai Heng was having a different thought; apart from the shock, his heart was filled with a grievance.Qin Nan had finished learning \u2018Mystical Eight Steps\u2019 in five hours\u2014did that mean Xiao Qingxue had won the bet?What triggered Bai Heng more was that Qin Nan was unsatisfied that he took five hours to learn an Ultimate Martial Skill. Did he think five hours to learn an Ultimate Martial Skill was too much\u2026?When he had this thought, Bai Heng almost broke out cursing.Why the f**k is this Qin Nan so insane?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I bet that you would learn the martial skill in eleven hours; he bet twenty four hours. The stake was one hundred Xiantian Pills and it seems like I\u2019ve won.\u201d\u201cA hundred Xiantian Pills?\u201d Qin Nan frowned his eyebrows.He did know the value of Xiantian Pills, but he had never seen them before.What shocked him was that the stake was one hundred Xiantian Pills\u2014such a high stake just for a bet between Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng.\u201cSenior Sister Xiao, these are the pills.\u201d The gloomy Bai Heng took a small jade jar out which contained one hundred Xiantian Pills in it.Qin Nan immediately glanced at it; the Xiantian Pills appeared to be five times smaller than Body Tempering Pills. They looked like small, clear crystals. He could tell the amount of Qi these pills contained was at least ten times more than the Body Tempering Pills.Apart from that, Qin Nan could feel a special force enclosed within the pills.\u201cIf I consumed one hundred Xiantian Pills, what level would the Divine Battle Spirit be improved to?\u201d A sudden thought came up to Qin Nan.Bai Heng, on the other hand, felt his heart was dripping blood. He could not control his anger when he looked at Qin Nan and said, \u201cQin Nan, you have learnt Mystical Eight Steps in just five hours\u2019 time. Why don\u2019t you show it to us? I\u2019ve heard the name of Mystical Eight Steps before, but I\u2019ve yet to witness it myself.\u201dEven though there was nothing wrong with his words, it was obvious that his tone was filled with doubts.Qin Nan let out a gentle smile as he had no intention to argue with him. His body started moving.\\nIt appeared as though his body\u2019s outline started to turn blurry. His location would change with every step he took; there came the second step, the third step, and the fourth step\u2026 Every step had a mystical feeling to it, and the steps were all different. Each step was accompanied by a surge of wind, as if Qin Nan was transforming into a phantom, a lightning, a flame at times\u2014it was difficult to determine his exact location.Qin Nan\u2019s movement had finally stopped at the hundredth step, who ended up at the initial location\u2014as if he did not move at all.That was the Mystical Eight Steps.The martial skill involved one hundred different pieces of footwork which appeared to be unrelated to each other; but there was actually an undetectable connection between them. As the skill was improved, the number of steps would decrease; only eight steps would be left when one had mastered the skill.\u3002As the number of steps decreased, the power of the martial skill was increased.When he saw this this, Bai Heng unknowingly shut his mouth\u2014he did not dare to say anything more.However, Qin Nan did not plan to let it go; with a sudden thought, he smilingly said, \u201cThe bet between Senior Brother Bai Heng and Qingxue was quite interesting. Would Senior Brother Bai Heng be interested to have a bet with me?\u201d\u201cAnother bet?\u201d Bai Heng was slightly shaken, and had a slightly terrible expression on his face. He was getting annoyed of the word \u2018bet\u2019 being mentioned.\u201cYes.\u201d Qin Nan calmly said. \u201cThere are nine days left until we reach the Mystic Spirit Sect, which I could make use of the time to practice Mystical Eight Steps. Our bet would be to see if I\u2019m able to master this Mystical Eight Steps in the remaining nine days.\u201d\\nNot only Bai Heng was shocked, even Xiao Qingxue was shocked too, who said, \u201cQin Nan, nine days to master Mystical Eight Steps, are you out of your mind?\u201dIt was known that even for a tenth-grade Huang ranked super genius, it was impossible to master an ultimate martial skill in less than a month\u2019s time.Now Qin Nan dared to bluff that he could master Mystical Eight Steps in just nine days?\u201cHAHAHA.\u201d Upon hearing this, Bai Heng started laughing. \u201cJunior Brother Qin, you\u2019re no doubt a youngster, being so ballsy and having such confidence. If you say so, I would be willing to participate in this bet. If Junior Brother Qin does not manage to do so in nine days, you will have to hand over one hundred Xiantian Pills. How does that sound?\u201dAfter finishing this sentence, Bai Heng stared at Qin Nan with a pair of fiery eyes\u2014he could not wait for Qin Nan to accept the bet.Xiao Qingxue slightly frowned her eyebrows and said, \u201cBai Heng, stop the nonsense. Qin Nan, don\u2019t agree\u2026\u201dIn Xiao Qingxue\u2019s view, there was no chance of Qin Nan winning the bet. He would end up giving one hundred Xiantian Pills to Bai Heng for free.\u201cQingxue, I understand the risk of the bet. I was not trying to win, but rather to give myself some pressure.\u201d Qin Nan let out a gentle smile at Xiao Qingxue, then turned to Bai Heng and said, \u201cSenior Brother Bai Heng, I do not have one hundred Xiantian Pills on me right now; Why doesn\u2019t Sister Xiao Qingxue be our witness, and I\u2019ll give it to you sometime later?\u201d\u201cOf course, no problem.\u201d Bai Heng immediately nodded his head; he was not worried that Qin Nan would renege.Xiao Qingxue shook her head slightly, but decided not to say anything after she saw Qin Nan\u2019s firm expression. The fact was, one hundred Xiantian Pills was not a big deal.\\n\u201cGood. Then, since the bet is confirmed, I won\u2019t waste anymore time and I\u2019ll go practice.\u201d Qin Nan held his fists toward the two, then proceeded forward with Mystical Eight Steps in a step-by-step fashion.Same as before, Qin Nan had fallen into a stance of \u2018One with the Mind.\u2019 His surroundings were no longer relevant to him\u2014Mystical Eight Steps was the only thing he cared for.Despite that, Bai Heng was not at all worried after seeing this\u2014in fact, he was extremely excited.Even a Super Genius with a tenth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit would not be able to reach the \u2018Greater Success Stage\u2019 of an Ultimate Martial Skill in a month\u2019s time. Even if you Qin Nan are super talented, you wouldn\u2019t be able to master it in nine days, right?Although Bai Heng was still suspicious at first; where did Qin Nan get his confidence from to come up with such a crazy bet?However, his doubt was soon eliminated; no matter how outstanding you are, you have to obey the principles of nature, right?Therefore, in Bai Heng\u2019s mind, he had assumed the victory to be his in the bet.Now with the thought that Qin Nan would owe him one hundred Xiantian Pills, Bai Heng no longer looked at him with eyes filled with jealousy; he started to admire him.The three continued their journey, with Qin Nan practicing his martial skill at the same time.The way Qin Nan immersed himself in his practice had once again shocked Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng.Qin Nan was repeating the same action over and over again like a puppet with no sense of tiredness; there was no sign of him stopping.\u3002Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng had noticed that his whole body was trembling due to fatigue, but he had no intention to stop.\\nThis guy was like a maniac, who would keep on going once he started doing something!\u3002A day had gone in a rush; it was soon night time. The sky was densely filled with shiny stars and the valley fell into a silence.Qin Nan\u2019s Mystical Eight Steps had reached ninety steps in a day\u2019s time.Despite that, it was still a long journey from mastering the Mystical Eight Steps.Suddenly, Qin Nan\u2019s body\u2014which was executing the martial skill continuously\u2014finally came to a stop.When he saw this, Bai Heng was filled with joy, and said laughingly, \u201cBrother Qin Nan, there\u2019s no need to try so hard. With your current cultivation base being just at the fifth-layer in the Body Tempering Realm, you still need to meditate at night. Even I am unable to keep going for a whole day; it\u2019s impossible unless you\u2019ve reached the Martial Emperor Realm.\u201dXiao Qingxue nodded and said in a gentle voice, \u201cBai Heng\u2019s right. Qin Nan, come over and rest for a bit.\u201dEven though she admired Qin Nan\u2019s determination in practicing, she did not wish Qin Nan to practice without resting. If he continued for the whole day, it would have negative impact on Qin Nan\u2019s body, which could hinder his future growth.Qin Nan stood before them without moving, as if he could not hear a single word from the two.Bai Heng\u2019s expression changed in an instant\u2014he then rushed up to Qin Nan. If something happened to Qin Nan while he was practicing this martial skill, Bai Heng would be the first to blame due to the bet.Xiao Qingxue appeared beside him too.However, as the two arrived before Qin Nan, a shocked expression appeared on their faces again.It seemed like Qin Nan had his eyes closed while breathing in a regular pattern; his whole body was relaxed\u2014it looked exactly like someone who had fallen asleep.\\nApart from that, what shocked them was that Qin Nan was mumbling like he was talking in his sleep, \u201cMystical Eight Steps, profound steps, with each step having their own definition. Grasping these definitions would allow the steps to be merged and combined\u2026\u201dAs Qin Nan continued to mumble, his body started to move slowly; he began to execute Mystical Eight Steps!Xiao Qingxue and Bai Heng took a deep breath at the same time.Is this Qin Nan\u2026 still practicing even in his sleep?While the two were in shock, Qin Nan\u2019s actions were getting faster, with the steps producing gusts of wind.At times\u2014in the dark valley under the night sky full of stars\u2014his body was either floating around like a cloud of smoke, or came flooding like a sea of flame; his aura changed continuously.Xiao Qingxue said as she recovered from the shock, \u201cI have finally understood why Qin Nan has such talent in learning martial skills. It is said that there are people who were born for learning Martial Skills. While these people are practicing, they are not worried about food, sleep, or even if the apocalypse came. These people are known as Martial Addicts!\u201d\u201cI was told that in the Mystic Spirit Sect, there existed a powerful senior who was a Martial Addict, but it was yet to be proven. Never did I expect to see a Martial Addict myself here today.\u201dAfter saying this, her gaze was fixed onto Qin Nan\u2019s back, with a pair of flickering eyes.Qin Nan\u2019s body continued to flash to different spots, until he merged and became one with the darkness of the valley and the night sky.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Trial of VersatilityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36 \u2013 Trial of VersatilityTime passed without anyone noticing; eight days were gone in a blink of an eye.In these eight days, Qin Nan had remained in the insane state of repetition even during meal times, sleep, etc.During the period, Qin Nan had only awakened once. This one time Qin Nan\u2019s body could no longer continue to practice due to the extreme fatigue and collapsed.However, the pause had lasted no longer than the time it took for an incense to burn.As a result, Qin Nan\u2019s Mystical Eight Steps had improved to thirty steps.While he was executing it, it felt as though he had turned into a gust of strong wind which swept past the surroundings, making his position undetectable. People would be left speechless if they witnessed his incredible speed.Due to Qin Nan being a natural born \u2018Martial Addict\u2019, Bai Heng was forced to be on tenterhooks in these eight days; he was worried that Qin Nan would \u2018accidentally\u2019 achieved the Greater Success Stage of Mystical Eight Steps.Hence, only today did Bai Heng finally feel relieved, a smile appearing on his face.It\u2019s impossible for you to improve from thirty steps to eight steps in a day\u2019s time, right?In addition, when practicing an Ultimate Martial Skill, the later stages of training would be more difficult. It was impossible to improve without practicing continuously for a period of time.Therefore, in Bai Heng\u2019s mind, he assumed Qin Nan would surely lose the bet this time.As for Xiao Qingxue, it did not matter if Qin Nan won or lost the bet.Xiao Qingxue found her gaze focused on Qin Nan\u2014while he immersed himself in practice during these eight days\u2014for unknown reasons. She was attracted to a unique charm that Qin Nan exuded ever since he had fallen into his current \u2018insane\u2019 trance.\\nQin Nan, who was moving around practicing his martial skill at the front, came to a sudden stop. He was breathing heavily, his body covered in sweat; he appeared to be extremely tired, but his eyes still flickered with excitement as he asked, \u201cWhich day is today? Where are we now?\u201dWith a surprisingly good attitude, Bai Heng said with a laugh, \u201cToday is the eighth day. We are not far from the Mystic Spirit Sect. We will arrive there around dusk tomorrow.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the eighth day already,\u201d Qin Nan let out a surprised expression and said, \u201cIt felt like only a brief moment.\u201dXiao Qingxue chuckled, then snapped, \u201cYou went insane when you started practicing. How would you know how much time had passed?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Qin Nan was left speechless, not knowing how to deal with the ladylike attitude displayed by Xiao Qingxue.It was Bai Heng beside them who thought of something , and smilingly said, \u201cBrother Qin Nan, maybe we should stop practicing for the day? We should rest well tonight as we will be arriving at the Mystic Spirit Sect tomorrow. For the stake of one hundred Xiantian Pills, you can just give me fifty of them.\u201dThe reason Bai Heng said this was because with Qin Nan being a natural born \u2018Martial Addict\u2019 in addition to having an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, it was not ideal to become enemies with him\u2014hence, he decided to reduce the stake to fifty Xiantian Pills.To an extent, Bai Heng was very proud of himself after finishing this sentence.Reducing the stake to fifty Xiantian Pills just like that, even if you had any thoughts, you would not continue to hate me, right Qin Nan?When he heard this, Qin Nan let out a gentle smile and said, \u201cBrother Bai Heng, I don\u2019t agree with your statement. Are you implying that I would lose the bet for sure?\u201d\\nBai Heng was stunned immediately, not knowing what to say.Even at this time, you, Qin Nan, still think that you would not lose?Although Bai Heng was frightened of Qin Nan, he did not feel pleasant at this time, but he forced a laugh and said, \u201cIf Brother Qin Nan does not think you have lost, feel free to continue practicing. I have never seen anyone achieve the Greater Success Stage of an Ultimate Martial Skill in nine days!\u201dThe words were filled with a hidden sarcastic tone.Qin Nan was not angry, but said with a smile, \u201cI see. If that\u2019s the case, I will make sure Brother Bai Heng can learn something new today.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan shut his eyes and once again entered the state of \u2018One with the Mind\u2019 in less than five breaths. His body started to move around due to the execution of the Mystical Eight Steps.Upon seeing this, Bai Heng\u2019s face turned dull with a cold smirk.I gave you my respect, but you rejected it!He would like to see how Qin Nan planned to teach him something.However, in the next moment, Bai Heng\u2019s smirk was gone; Xiao Qingxue\u2014who was not far away\u2014had her attractive eyes opened wide too.Behind Qin Nan\u2014who was immersed in his \u2018insane\u2019 state\u2014an enormous Martial Spirit stood in the air, like a dominating emperor looking down on the surroundings.Did Qin Nan release his Martial Spirit? What was his intention of doing so?An answer soon came to Bai Heng and Xiao Qingxuethe next second.After the Divine Battle Spirit had risen, the aura emitted from Qin Nan had suddenly changed; it had a mystical feeling. In less than the time it took an incense stick to burn, his speed had doubled.\\nAs both Bai Heng and Xiao Qingxue had sharp senses, they immediately saw the improvement on Qin Nan\u2019s \u2018Mystical Eight Steps\u2019\u2014which was reduced to twenty-five steps.\u201cWhat\u2026 What is happening?\u201d Bai Heng\u2019s mind went blank. He could not understand why this was happening.Not only was Bai Heng unable to understand, Xiao Qingxue was also frowning her eyebrows in confusion.As time passed quickly, after releasing the Divine Battle Spirit, Qin Nan felt his comprehension had multiplied by a few times. Most of the doubts he previously had were gone in that instant.Besides that, the secrets of the Mystical Eight Steps rose in his mind, as if he had already fully understood the martial skill.Finally, Qin Nan\u2019s body stopped, as an enlightened expression showed on his face and a sense of joy appeared in his heart.\u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s it. I understand now! The secret to Mystical Eight Steps was combining a hundred foot works into eight steps. These eight steps are in charge of eight different directions. Each direction has its own step\u2026\u201dIn that instant, Qin Nan had completely discovered the secrets of the Mystical Eight Steps.His body instantly sprang forward, changing his movements rapidly between the eight different directions. Not only was he incredibly fast, he was also moving around like a phantom; it was difficult to predict his movements and identify his location.Mystical Eight Steps\u2014fully mastered!\u201cHAHAHA!\u201d Qin Nan let out a loud laugh and came to a stop. He looked in the direction of Bai Heng and said, \u201cHow was that? Brother Bai Heng, have I taught you something new today?\u201dWhen he heard this, Bai Heng\u2014who was not far away\u2014finally collected his thoughts from the shock.However, his eyes still regarded Qin Nan as a god.Had Qin Nan actually done it?\\nEven a super genius with a tenth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit would not be able to master an Ultimate Martial Skill in nine days\u2026 but Qin Nan had done it?What kind of monster was this guy?Xiao Qingxue felt the same way, except she wasn\u2019t as crazed as Bai Heng; she quickly recovered from the shock, and asked instantly, \u201cQin Nan, why is this happening? How come your comprehension skyrocketed after unleashing your Martial Spirit?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because my Martial Spirit helps me to master Martial Skills.\u201d Qin Nan smiled gently.The fact was, in the beginning, Qin Nan had the same doubt; he was not sure if this was the case. However, when he was reading Tie San\u2019s notes about the experiences that helped him master \u2018One with the Sword\u2019 with ease, he had reached a conclusion.If it was not because of the Divine Battle Spirit, how did his comprehension improve so rapidly?\u201cI see.\u201d Xiao Qingxue inhaled a deep breath, and said in a serious tone, \u201cThis Martial Spirit\u2019s capabilities are extraordinary. You should spend more time on learning Martial Skills. With your talent and sufficient Martial Skills, it would not be impossible for you to invent some powerful Martial Skills yourself.\u201dQin Nan raised his head slightly. He clearly knew this, even without Xiao Qingxue\u2019s reminder.Ever since he was young, he had an incredible passion for Martial Skills. Even before awakening his Martial Spirit, he had invented a Saber Skill. However, as he had not awoken his Martial Spirit and his cultivation was still weak, the skill was not powerful.A moment later, Qin Nan stared at Bai Heng\u2014who was still in shock\u2014and smilingly said, \u201cBrother Bai Heng, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you about my Martial Spirit, which let me take advantage of you. Therefore, you only need to give me fifty of the hundred Xiantian Pills.\u201d\\nAt this time, Bai Heng had recovered, but he did something unexpected after.Bai Heng head shook like rolling waves and said instantly, \u201cNo\u2014! Please no, no, no! I have to give one hundred Xiantian Pills. No, no, no, I\u2019ll give two hundred Xiantian Pills\u2014 two hundred!\u201dQin Nan and Xiao Qingxue were stunned after they heard these words.What\u2019s wrong with this Bai Heng? Why is he giving more Xiantian Pills?Little did they know, Bai Heng was completely convinced into submission to Qin Nan.In Bai Heng\u2019s current mindset, he did not care about his loss anymore. There was only a single thought in his mind: to avoid opposing Qin Nan at all cost, even if it meant he would be his slave or subordinate\u2014anything was better than being his enemy.In other words, Qin Nan had become a most highly respected person in Bai Heng\u2019s mind, with a hint of fear.\u201cThat will not be necessary.\u201d Qin Nan waved his hand and said firmly, \u201cFifty Xiantian Pills will do. It\u2019s a lot for me even if it\u2019s just fifty of them.\u201dBai Heng nodded like a chick pecking at the ground, and immediately handed over the pills and said, \u201cYep, yep, yep\u2026 Young Master Qin Nan\u2019s will is my will\u2026\u201dNo one noticed that Bai Heng had initially called Qin Nan \u2018trash/waste,\u2019 which then had turned into \u2018Brother Qin Nan, Mr. Qin Nan\u2019, and now it became \u2018Young Master Qin Nan\u2019.Holding the jar of Xiantian Pills and feeling the amount of Qi enclosed within it, Qin Nan was unable to hide his excitement.In that instant, Xiao Qingxue suddenly said, \u201cQin Nan, you did not let me down. You would definitely get a good ranking in the upcoming \u2018Trial of Versatility\u2019.\u201cTrial of Versatility?\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s face was filled with doubts.\\nBai Heng instantly interrupted and said, \u201cYoung Master Qin Nan, the \u2018Trial of Versatility\u2019 is a trial between the newly recruited disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect. The trial focuses on observing the temperament and talent of the disciples. It was held every three years previously. However, since we are recruiting disciples every two years, it is now held every two years.\u201d\u201cThe reward from the \u2018Trial of Versatility\u2019 is extremely beneficial.\u201d Xiao Qingxue added.\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Qin Nan smiled and said, \u201cIf that\u2019s so, I would be interested to see what kind of geniuses has the Mystic Spirit Sect recruited this time.\u201dUpon saying this, Qin Nan\u2019s eyes were filled with a sense of eagerness, and a lust for battle.Only the talented were recruited as disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect. Who would be the strong and the weak when geniuses gathered at the trial?For the remaining journey, the three no longer planned to waste any more time. As the second day\u2019s dusk arrived, Qin Nan finally set his foot into the Mystic Spirit Sect.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Gathering of the GeniusesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37 \u2013 Gathering of the GeniusesThe Mystic Spirit Sect was located in the north of the Luo River Kingdom; it used Tian Feng Mountain as a foundation to build its entrance.Qin Nan was currently standing at the foot of Tian Feng Mountain. Ahead of him stood an enormous arc-shaped door around fifty meters tall. Behind the door, a few lines of green pathways made of flagstones led toward the mountain\u2019s peak.On top of the tall mountain peak, among the mists, there stood a huge flaming-red palace that was only faintly discernible, causing one to feel tiny before it. This was the Mystic Spirit Sect, one of the four big sects of the Luo River Kingdom, the dream sacred martial ground of countless youngsters within the kingdom.As Qin Nan had a firm heart to pursue Martial Arts due to his Divine Battle Spirit, he began to feel excited at the foot of the Mystic Spirit Sect.Upon entering the Mystic Spirit Sect, he would start to know more about the world, and step onto a bigger stage.Upon entering the Mystic Spirit Sect, he would meet all different kinds of geniuses and compete with them in battle.\u201cLet\u2019s go. The new disciples from all over have surely gathered here in the Mystic Spirit Sect by now.\u201d Xiao Qingxue said while covering her smile with her hand, her eyes flickering.No one would have guessed that the \u2018the top-ranked beauty\u2019 of the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2014who was also one of the top geniuses\u2014was looking forward to seeing what kind of drama Qin Nan would cause after he joined the Mystic Spirit Sect.Qin Nan raised his head slightly, and stepped past the big entrance as he followed behind Xiao Qingxue. They proceeded upward following the meandering pathway.On the way, Bai Heng hurriedly explained, \u201cYoung Master Qin Nan, the disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect are classified into outer, inner, and core disciples. Every new disciple who recently joined the sect is classified as an outer disciple, regardless of their Martial Spirits\u2019 grade. They are promoted once their cultivation has improved. Those below Martial Emperor Realm are outer disciples, and those above, inner. As for the core disciples, their presences are highly ranked in the Mystic Spirit Sect; I have no information about them unless their authority is weaker than the elders\u2019\u2026\u201d\\nQin Nay nodded lightly, but in his mind, he was surprised.This is indeed one of the top four sects of the Luo River Kingdom; one has to reach the Martial Emperor level to be promoted to a mere inner disciple.If that\u2019s the case, how powerful could the core disciples be?Bai Heng continued to explain, \u201cOuter disciples live in the outer domain. Inner disciples are allowed to develop their own caverns as homes. Furthermore, the Mystic Spirit Sect has a few main halls, which are: the Sect Leader\u2019s Hall, the Hall of Fame, the Hall of Discipline, the Skills Library, the Treasure Vault, and the Hall of Life and Death. The functions of these halls can mostly be determined from their names, except for the Hall of Life and Death, which is somewhat special.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Qin Nan was slightly intrigued.A complicated expression appeared in Bai Heng\u2019s eyes as he said, \u201cInfighting is prohibited in the Mystic Spirit Sect. Those who break this rule are exiled without exception. Thus, the purpose of this Hall of Life and Death is to resolve conflicts between the disciples. However, once the two enter the Hall of Life and Death, there are no restrictions on their lives anymore\u2014the fight will only end once a person is killed. If not for this, they would need to face penalties according to the rules of the sect.\u201d\u201cNo restrictions on their lives, and one of them must die?\u201dQin Nan took a deep breath. I never expected this Hall of Life and Death to be so cruel; one of the two must die upon entering it.\u201cBesides that, there are ten important rules in the Mystic Spirit Sect. The first rule is no infighting, as mentioned before. The second one is: no betrayal is allowed. The third one is\u2026\u201d\\nWith Bai Heng\u2019s explanation along the journey, Qin Nan could now somewhat understand how the Mystic Spirit Sect operated.In the meantime, they arrived at the mountain\u2019s peak.A spacious outdoor dojo appeared before Qin Nan. The whole dojo was made of white jade, which made it look like an enormous ice cube. Under the dojo, it felt like there existed a huge active formation, which caused the Qi at the dojo to be several times more abundant. At this time, the huge White Jade Dojo was densely filled with people; an estimated few hundred at least.Qin Nan instinctively looked at the crowd, some of them were wearing luxurious clothing, while others wore plain clothing; some had a somewhat weird style of fashion. They were all young-looking, but the most eye-catching thing for Qin Nan was the powerful aura emitted from all of them.Qin Nan had noticed that the weakest cultivation base among the crowd was the fourth-layer Body Tempering Realm, while the strongest had even reached the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm!\u201cThese are this year\u2019s freshly recruited disciples.\u201d Bai Heng lowered his voice. Instead of gazing at the crowd of youngsters with arrogance, a hint of fear could be seen in his eyes.When he heard this, Qin Nan\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he secretly inhaled sharply.The Mystic Spirit Sect being one of the top four sects is no joke at all; these new disciples are all so talented.\u201cBai Heng, this will be as far as you accompany us.\u201d Xiao Qingxue said.Bai Heng nodded his head, without showing any signs of growing angry. He gave Qin Nan a respectful bow and walked away swiftly, disappearing into the palaces behind the White Jade Dojo.Xiao Qingxue softened her tone, \u201cQin Nan, I\u2019ll accompany you here. Later, an elder will be here to announce the start of the Trial of Versatility. Be sure you do not have any conflicts with anyone\u2014let me handle it.\u201d\\nQin Nan nodded and proceeded toward the crowd of hundreds of young disciples, together with Xiao Qingxue.At the same time, the group of young disciples noticed their approach and turned their gazes toward them.Of course, their lines of sight were attracted by Xiao Qingxue; their eyes were filled with surprised expressions.After a while, they collected their thoughts and noticed Qin Nan, who was standing beside Xiao Qingxue. Complicated expressions such as doubt, disdain, derision, curiosity, and pride could be seen in their eyes, as they started to gossip with each other.\u201cWho is this young man? Why is he accompanied by such a beauty?\u201d\u201cWhat, are you stupid? This is our Senior Sister named Xiao Qingxue\u2014an inner disciple. Not only is she known as the number one beauty of the Mystic Spirit Sect, but she also possesses an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit!\u201d\u201c\u201dWhat? This lady has an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?\u201d\u201cMy god, not only is this girl beautiful, but she also has such a powerful Martial Spirit. No wonder she is the top beauty of our Mystic Spirit Sect!\u201d\u201cHehe, from today onward, Sister Xiao will be my dream girl!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAmong these hundreds of new disciples, everyone apart of a few were attracted by Xiao Qingxue.How could they not be attracted by a lady who was powerful and gorgeous at the same time?Qin Nan was not bothered by it. Instead, he preferred the situation to stay like this, so he could check the disciples out when their attention was focused on Xiao Qingxue.After a period of observation, a heavy expression appeared on Qin Nan\u2019s face. By his judgment, there were forty-three people he needed to keep an eye on.These forty-three people had no doubt reached the sixth-layer or above of the Body Tempering Realm. Furthermore, Qin Nan was able to feel a sense of danger from these people, possibly because they had a lot of killing experience.\\nThat being said, even though these forty-three disciples possessed high cultivation bases, their Martial Spirit\u2019s grades were not higher than Qin Nan\u2019s.The reason behind this was that the Mystic Spirit Sect had changed its period of recruiting disciples from every three years to every two years. After losing to the super geniuses from the previous trials, those disqualified talented candidates would use the period between the trials to improve themselves, just like Fang Rulong of Lingshui City.If Qin Nan had not forced him to forfeit his cultivation, in two years\u2019 time, his cultivation base would have improved to a certain degree. When that time came and there was no other genius from Lingshui City who could surpass Fang Rulong, then Fang Rulong would have become the top genius of Lingshui City, and would have been qualified to join the Mystic Spirit Sect.At this time, a sudden, slightly wicked voice was heard, \u201cYo, I was just guessing who had caught the attention of all the disciples here, and it appears to be the Beautiful Xiao. Tsk tsk, why is the Beautiful Xiao here keeping a ladyboy company, instead of her spending time with Mr. Ou Yang?\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who told you to reject me before? Would you still reject me if I had the talent and background like Mr. Ou Yang? Ah, Miss Xiao Qingxue, today I\u2014Mo Li\u2014am telling you, if you\u2019re willing to keep me company, I\u2019ll stop pestering you. If you aren\u2019t\u2026\u201dNo one had expected Mo Li to be so cocky, saying such disrespectful and daring words in public.An icy expression appeared on Xiao Qingxue\u2019s face, and her body emitted a murderous aura, \u201cPiss off!\u201d\u201cPiss off?\u201d Mo Li did not care about her murderous intent. Instead, he released a lustful expression while he stared fearlessly at Xiao Qingxue\u2019s body, \u201cI would gladly do so! Didn\u2019t I tell you before, if you\u2014\u201d\\nHowever, this time, before Mo Li was able to finish his sentence, a calm voice interrupted, \u201cMo Li, is it? I have never seen any guy as shameless as you. I have learned something new upon meeting you today.\u201dThe one speaking was none other than Qin Nan.Qin Nan stood up without hesitation, even though he knew that this Mo Li had some background, he still chose to interfere.In Qin Nan\u2019s view, Xiao Qingxue was his friend, who had helped him on several occasions. Therefore, Qin Nan would not be a bystander when Xiao Qingxue was mocked in front of the crowd.Even if his current cultivation base was merely the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm.Upon hearing this, Mo Li had his face turned cold. His body was filled with a murderous aura like the form of soaring dragons; his eyes stared hard at Qin Nan and in a deep voice, he said, \u201cSuch courage, a mere new recruit dares to oppose me? Young lad, do you know who I am?\u201dXiao Qingxue gathered her thoughts and saw that Qin Nan was standing firmly in front of her. She felt a warm feeling inside her heart, as if something had just touched it.However, she instantly reacted by slightly changing her expression and said, \u201cMo Li, don\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201dBefore she could finish, Qin Nan reached out his hand and tapped gently on her shoulder, indicating for her to say nothing.Under the crowd\u2019s gaze, Qin Nan stood firmly in front, facing the intimidating aura from Mo Li, and\u2014showing no sign of being affected\u2014he let out a cold smirk and said, \u201cWho are you? If I\u2019m guessing right, you would be one of the elders\u2019 son, or disciple? But who cares? Do you know who I am?\u201dWhen he said this, Qin Nan straightened his body, emitting a prideful aura.\\nThe surrounding disciples found themselves checking Qin Nan out with flickering eyes.They were unaware of Qin Nan\u2019s presence previously. Thus, it was surprising for them to see this guy\u2014with a mere cultivation base of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm\u2014be brave enough to oppose Mo Li, who appeared to have quite a formidable background.Following this, the disciples remembered then how Xiao Qingxue had escorted Qin Nan to the White Jade Dojo.Either of these two reasons seemed to indicate that this \u2018ordinary guy\u2019 beside Xiao Qingxue, maybe was not ordinary at all?Mo Li was stunned for a while too. He had never expected a new disciple to go against his words, but he was definitely not someone to fool with, as his face turned cold and he said, \u201cWho are you?\u201dAs he asked the question, it seemed like Mo Li was being slightly cautious.This was Mo Li\u2019s way of approaching matters; he would always be careful and plan ahead before taking any action when he was not sure of his opponent\u2019s background.\u201cClean out your ears and listen carefully.\u201d Qin Nan let out a smile and said, \u201cMy name is Qin Nan, from the Luo River Kingdom. I was discovered by Sister Xiao Qingxue and selected to join the Mystic Spirit Sect. In other words, I am one of the Mystic Spirit Sect, an outer disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect.\u201dAfter hearing the words, the crowd was staggered; even Xiao Qingxue almost let out a laugh, and covered her mouth with her hand instantly.Wasn\u2019t your face full of pride before? Aren\u2019t you being fearless?After saying all these things, now you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re just an ordinary outer disciple?Everyone had come to an understanding\u2014Qin Nan\u2019s previous actions were just fooling Mo Li.\\nUpon hearing the words, Mo Li\u2019s face turned dark immediately; his eyes filled with a faint green glow as he stared at Qin Nan.Since when had he allowed a freshly recruited outer disciple to treat him like a fool?Mo Li\u2019s chest immediately started burning with flames of anger, emitting a murderous aura. However, he did not plan to hurt him right now. He was still currently in the Mystic Spirit Sect; even if he had a powerful background, he could not afford to face the consequences of breaking the rules of the Mystic Spirit Sect.After inhaling a deep breath and concealing his anger, Mo Li let out a sudden sarcastic laugh, \u201cTsk, tsk, how fearless\u2026 Qin Nan, right? Do you really think that once you\u2019ve become a disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect you\u2019re invincible? Let me tell you something; this is just the beginning. Be sure to remain low-key, or else you won\u2019t know how you died\u2026\u201dThe last sentence was filled with a thick threat.Xiao Qingxue\u2019s expression immediately turned icy-cold while she emitted a murderous aura, \u201cMo Li, are you threatening Qin Nan? I\u2019m telling you\u2014I am the one who brought Qin Nan to the Mystic Spirit Sect. If you dare to touch him, I\u2019ll surely teach you a lesson!\u201dThis time, the pressure from Xiao Qingxue\u2019s cultivation base of the Martial Emperor Realm was fully unleashed among the crowd.This time, she had really gotten mad.Mo Li\u2019s expression changed slightly; he was intimidated by the furious Xiao Qingxue, and immediately manipulated his previous words, \u201cHehe, I didn\u2019t threaten him. This Qin Nan is the new disciple you have recruited? A cultivation base of fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm\u2014seems a bit trashy.\u201dAfter he said this, he hesitated for a moment, and gave Qin Nan an evil smirk, \u201cWhat a coincidence, I have discovered a genius too. I\u2019ll tell him to have a good time with you in the Trial of Versatility.\u201d\\nAfter saying this, Mo Li let out a few evil laughs, before floating away from the White Jade Dojo like a cloud of black smoke, as if he had never appeared before.Xiao Qingxue let out a \u2018humph\u2019, and withdrew her aura. She then thought of something, and said to Qin Nan in a soft tone, \u201cThis Mo Li is the son of the third elder of the Mystic Spirit Sect. Even though he only has a seventh-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, his cultivation base is on par with mine. Furthermore, this Mo Li is extremely cruel and merciless; those who offend him will need to face his revenge\u2026 Qin Nan, you were being reckless just then.\u201dXiao Qingxue appeared worried when she said the last sentence.Despite that, Qin Nan let out a relaxed smile and shook his head, \u201cSister Qingxue, one does not become successful by being careful and compromising in the world of Martial Art. Besides, I would not allow you to be bullied by him; even if he was the son of the Sect Leader, I would scold him without hesitation. If my cultivation base was strong enough, instead of facing him with my current attitude, I would directly face him in the Hall of Life and Death.\u201dWhen he said this, Qin Nan gave a cold smirk with a prideful and fearless aura.This was Qin Nan\u2019s nature; why would he compromise when he had the Divine Battle Spirit?For a friend who had helped him on several occasions; why would he be a bystander and watch her be bullied in public?Xiao Qingxue was stunned; complicated feelings were seen in her eyes, which appeared to be slightly glistening with tears. However, it only lasted for a brief while, as she quickly recovered.Xiao Qingxue let out a blossoming smile and said, \u201cBrother Qin Nan, now I feel that it\u2019s wonderful to have met you.\u201d\\nAlthough Qin Nan had a strong mind, he could not help but stagger after seeing Xiao Qingxue\u2019s smile at this moment.However, a strange occurrence took place at the same time.The White Jade Dojo was filled with an immensely powerful aura. A deafening flute\u2014coming from unknown direction\u2014was heard by the crowd.In that instant, the dojo was covered in a murderous aura.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Among the nine golden rays was a floating, flaming red flute. The deafening noise originated from this.Everyone was aghast at the sight\u2014even Qin Nan\u2019s eyes were filled with surprise.Nine golden rays\u2026 This guy\u2019s Martial Spirit is ninth-grade Huang ranked!A ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014how marvelous is that?Even in the Mystic Spirit Sect, anyone with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was considered one of the top talents. Anyone with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit would then have to be a super genius.This was a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit before them; even though it was only a grade higher than the eighth-grade Huang rank, the difference was incredibly large.\u201cAh! It\u2019s Ling Zixiao!\u201d Among the disciples, a seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm youngster yelled suddenly, with a respectful expression on his face, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him before. This young man, possessing a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, had reached the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm just three months after awakening it.Upon hearing this, everyone finally recovered from the shock, while breathing heavily. Their gazes toward Ling Zixiao were filled with a sense of fear.As a matter of fact, it did not matter if they knew Ling Zixiao\u2019s name or his identity. As soon as they had witnessed his ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, they were forced to be respectful\u2014and fearful.Who was worthy enough among the new disciples standing on this White Jade Dojo to compete with Ling Zixiao?\\nLing Zixiao ignored the crowd\u2019s reaction. His eyes were focused on the attractive Xiao Qingxue, as he gently recited a poem, \u201cA beautiful woman coming out from a painting, just like the descendant of a fairy maiden from the Heavens, such purity. I initially thought it was only a mere poem; little did I know such woman does indeed exist in this world.\u201dLing Zixiao took a deep breath and said with an honest face, \u201cLady Qingxue, My name\u2019s Ling Zixiao. Are you willing to be my friend?\u201dThroughout the whole process. Ling Zixiao\u2019s gaze never switched direction, as if he did not see Qin Nan standing beside Xiao Qingxue.Qin Nan was not bothered by Ling Zixiao\u2019s action; instead, he took the chance to carefully inspect Ling Zixiao\u2019s \u2018Fiery Flute Martial Spirit\u2019.Xiao Qingxue, on the other hand, frowned her eyebrows slightly. Although this Ling Zixiao had a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014which was a grade higher than hers, and could be deemed to have a bright future\u2014she wasn\u2019t fond of him for unknown reasons.Upon seeing Xiao Qingxue remain silent, Ling Zixiao gave Qin Nan a cold glare and said, \u201cThe reason Lady Qingxue is unwilling to accept my offer\u2014is it because of this guy? I stumbled into Brother Mo Li just now, who told me there was a piece of trash standing beside Lady Qingxue. I initially thought it was a joke, but seems like it was true.\u201dThroughout this time, a smile remained on Ling Zixiao\u2019s face, who pretended to be a gentleman.Despite this, Xiao Qingxue and Qin Nan\u2019s expressions turned cold at the same time.Xiao Qingxue had finally realized why she was not fond of Ling Zixiao; it was because this guy was the super genius Mo Li had discovered in the Luo River Kingdom!\\nAs for Qin Nan, there were no personal feelings about Ling Zixiao initially. However, with Mo Li\u2019s provocation, Ling Zixiao had approached them and smilingly mocked him straightaway\u2014why would Qin Nan feel content?Do you, Ling Zixiao, really think you\u2019re unbeatable with your ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?The disciples in the surroundings of the White Jade Dojo all looked forward of how the drama would develop before them.They were interested to see how Qin Nan\u2014who previously opposed Mo Li\u2014would react facing someone with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit like Ling Zixiao.At that moment, another strange occurrence suddenly took place.Everyone was experiencing a strange feeling, as if a river of blood had descended, bringing an incredibly bloody aura toward them, along with a sense of agony and bloodlust.Everyone\u2019s expressions changed slightly, as the aura appeared to be much stronger and more ferocious than Ling Zixiao\u2019s!The previous smile on Ling Zixiao\u2019s face had stiffened, and he turned around, his eyes filled with coldness.Within their view, a bulky half-naked man approached them in huge steps; nine golden rays were seen emerging from his back\u2014among the rays was a large floating sword that looked like it was made of blood. It was the source of the bloody aura which encapsulated the entire area.Everyone staggered once again; another super genius with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?Furthermore, this muscleman\u2019s cultivation base had surpassed Ling Zixiao\u2019s, and reached the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm!When he saw this, Qin Nan took a deep breath. In addition to the forty-three people he noticed, plus these two ninth-grade Huang ranked super geniuses, it meant he now had to be cautious of a total of forty-five people.Even Qin Nan felt a sense of pressure in the current situation.\u201cThe Mystic Spirit Sect is indeed one of the top four sects, attracting the top talents to gather here. Now, there are already two ninth-grade Huang ranked recruits, which are only those that appear on the surface. No one knows the exact amount of ninth-grade Huang ranked people, or even the amount of eighth-grade Huang ranked people.\u201d Qin Nan thought while he analyzed the situation before him.\\nIt was unclear why\u2014even though he was exposed to such terrifying pressure\u2014Qin Nan\u2019s blood was flowing double the normal speed.His heart was racing, as if it was about to burst out from his chest.His body and his subconscious were excited after the entry of these two ninth-grade Huang ranked super geniuses.Despite that, no one paid attention to Qin Nan\u2019s reaction.Ling Zixiao\u2014who was initially gentleman-like\u2014was now wearing a cold expression, as he said, \u201cHuang Long, are you being a copycat, following my action of unleashing my Martial Spirit?\u201dThe muscleman\u2014whose name appeared to be Huang Long\u2014let out a laugh, his face full of disdain after hearing these words, \u201cLoser, stop talking bullshit. If you disapprove of my actions, then step forward; I\u2019ll grant you your death with just a slap!\u201dAs he spoke, a ferocious aura started to grow.The other new disciples at the White Jade Dojo were shocked. Previously, they were impressed by the aura emitted by Ling Zixiao; little did they know this Huang Long\u2014who had just arrived\u2014was more powerful and ruthless than Ling Zixiao.If they were to face Huang Long or Ling Zixiao, what would the outcome be?Almost everyone on the scene had the same thought.Following this, they immediately shook their heads to stop their imagination.To go against someone of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, or tenth-layer Body Tempering that possessed ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirits; were they out of their minds?Ling Zixiao\u2019s expression was even more twisted; instead of showing some respect, this Huang Long chose to slap him on the face in front of all the disciples.Despite that, Ling Zixiao did not dare to move, as Huang Long\u2019s cultivation was indeed two layers higher than him. If a fight broke out, Ling Zixiao did not have the confidence in himself.\\nDoes it mean I must just watch Huang Long be cocky and directly slap me on the face?Ling Zixiao took a deep breath. With a sudden flicker in his eyes, the cold expression on his face disappeared as he smirked and said, \u201cHuang Long, I do admit your cultivation is stronger, but don\u2019t think you can be cocky just because of that. Let me tell you something; this Qin Nan beside Lady Qingxue is a top genius who doesn\u2019t think Brother Mo Li is worthy of his attention!\u201dUpon hearing these words, Qin Nan and Xiao Qingxue\u2019s faces turned cold.This Ling Zixiao is indeed shameless; he plans to twist his words so that Huang Long would redirect his attention onto Qin Nan, to get rid of his own awkwardness.As expected, the focus of the crowd recentered on Qin Nan after these words.\u201cOh? Even Mo Li is not worthy of his attention?\u201d Huang Long appeared to be interested, as his wide open eyes looked in Qin Nan\u2019s direction. A disappointed expression appeared on his face after a glance, \u201cMerely fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm; he is nothing but a disrespectful piece of trash!\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - The Arrival of the ElderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40 \u2013 The Arrival of the ElderAll the disciples\u2019 gazes turned arrogant, along with a hint of anticipation.This Qin Nan is incredibly audacious\u2014he even has the guts to publicly challenge Senior Brother Mo in the sect. Now that he had been called trash by Huang Long, what kind of reaction would he have?Qin Nan wore no expression after hearing what was said, as he indifferently replied, \u201cTrash? It has only been a short twenty days since my Martial Spirit awakened. Even you, Huang Long, are not qualified to call me trash, right?\u201dAs Qin Nan said this, a sharp stream of Saber Intent rose from his body, dashed towards the sky, and swept over the entire area.At this moment, all of the disciples froze. All of the mockery and mischievous glints in their eyes were replaced by ghastly astonishment.\u201cTwenty days? Has his cultivation reached the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm in this time? Furthermore, is that Saber Intent?\u201d\u201cAs expected, this Qin Nan should not be underestimated at all. Being able to cultivate to the fifth-layer Body Tempering stage in such a short period of time, his Martial Spirit must be at least of the eighth-grade Huang rank. Furthermore, you need at least Greater Success in One with the Saber before you can release this Saber Intent\u2026.\u201cTsk, no wonder he is accompanied by Senior Sister Xiao Qingxue in person.\u201d\u201cNow I finally understand why\u2014with his potential, no wonder Qin Nan dares to challenge Mo Li!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAll the disciples who were mute in astonishment earlier gradually recovered and analyzed the situation carefully.After all, they were all geniuses brought by the Mystic Spirit Sect from the realms\u2019 cities with abundant knowledge and rich experiences. A hint of amazement flashed in Huang Long\u2019s eyes. He studied Qin Nan from head to toe again, and with a lopsided smile, he said: \u201cNot bad. This level of talent far surpasses other geniuses of the eighth-grade Huang rank. I take back what I said earlier; indeed, you are not trash\u2014you do have some capabilities.\u201d\\nQin Nan nodded indifferently, while the hostility that lingered in his heart also disappeared.Although Huang Long was used by Lin Zixiao to try and suppress him, when things were done, responsibility had to be taken.As Huang Long backed off first, Qin Nan\u2019s impression of him improved.At least this Huang Long wasn\u2019t someone who took advantages of others by abusing the authority he held.As Lin Zixiao understood the situation, knowing his plan had failed. He scorned: \u201cSo what if he achieved the fifth-layer Body Tempering stage with Saber Intent? He is still trash. Against this trash, I would only need one move to destroy him.\u201dThe new disciples all nodded hesitantly in acknowledgment after hearing his words.Although Lin Zixiao was not as good as Huang Long, his cultivation has also reached eighth-layer Body Tempering stage. Not to mention the existence of his ninth-grade Huang rank Martial Spirit.By the conversation earlier, they could roughly confirm that Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit was eighth-grade Huang ranked.If Qin Nan was going to battle Lin Zixiao, it was possible that Qin Nan wouldn\u2019t even withstand a single move of his.\u201cLin Zixiao, this is the White Jade Dojo, not a place for you to insult others.\u201d Xiao Qingxue spoke incisively: \u201cAs you said, so what if you have a ninth-grade Huang rank Martial Spirit? In my eyes, you are a trash that I can defeat in a single move.\u201dAs soon as Xiao Qingxue finished speaking, a killing intent floated around her body, and the atmosphere in the training ground abruptly became frigid.At this moment, all the disciples widened their eyes, as they never thought that a beauty like Xiao Qingxue would have had such a vicious side.Lin Zixiao\u2019s facial expressions froze; he never thought that for the sake of Qin Nan, Xiao Qingxue would turn against him.\\n However, he was unable to confute what Xiao Qingxue had said, as was the absolute truth. Even though his Martial Spirit had reached the ninth-rank Huang rank, wanting to surpass Xiao Qingxue within a year or two was impossible.\u201cHmm.\u201d Lin Zixiao ignored Xiao Qingxue\u2019s threat and spoke to Qin Nan: \u201cJust wait \u2018til the Trial of Versatility.\u201dLin Zixiao left after finishing his words. He blended into the new disciples, speaking freely and laughing, as if he was never threatened by Xiao Qingxue.Huang Long sat down cross-legged by himself. He began to cultivate from this position and within ten meters around him, no one dared to disturb him.Xiao Qingxue sighed in relief and gradually withdrew her aura, before speaking to Qin Nan in a low voice: \u201cDon\u2019t be concerned by Lin Zixiao\u2019s threat. This happened because of me. If he dares to pick on you again, tell me, and I will take care of it for you.\u201dXiao Qingxue said this purely out of consideration for Qin Nan.Whether with his Martial Spirit or cultivation now, Qin Nan was not on par with Lin Zixiao at all.Considering their backgrounds, how could Qin Nan\u2014who recently joined the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2014compete against Mo Li?Naturally, Qin Nan understood what Xiao Qingxue meant. He felt warmth creep into his heart, as he said with a light smile: \u201cQingxue, don\u2019t worry about me. There is nothing I, Qin Nan, fear in the world. Additionally, I\u2019m not someone that can be pushed around that easily, so you needn\u2019t worry.\u201dAs Qin Nan said this, his tone was cold: \u201cWhen the times comes, Lin Zixiao will be the one to regret this.\u201dXiao Qingxue\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment and she stared at Qin Nan in disbelief.This guy, where does he get his confidence from to make even Lin Zixiao regretful?\\nHowever, without knowing why, Xiao Qingxue believed him.Following this, the entire White Jade Dojo\u2019s atmosphere heated up as all the new disciples talked and made friends.Perhaps because Qin Nan had offended Mo Li and Lin Zixiao, it caused him to be isolated with no one wanting to approach him. However, that was fine for Qin Nan as it allowed more space for him to question Xiao Qingxue.On account of this, Qin Nan\u2019s understanding of the Mystic Spirit Sect grew a bit deeper.After the time it took approximately three incenses to burn, a stream of extremely boundless air suddenly shot from far away and\u2014like a burst of fierce wind\u2014filled the entire White Jade Dojo.All the new disciples\u2019 expression changed slightly, as they raised their heads as one.Qin Nan\u2019s breath also slowed for a second as the sense of pressure was even greater than the pressure which the Martial King realm had.At this moment, Xiao Qingxue murmured in a low voice: \u201cThe elder has arrived\u2026\u201dQin Nan\u2019s body tensed as he raised his head. A white-haired elder in a black robe floated in mid-air, before stepping toward them casually as if he was taking a stroll.This elder scanned the training ground, immediately noticing Huang Long and Lin Zixiao. He immediately nodded slightly, as he spoke in a loud and clear voice: \u201cNot bad, ninth-grade Huang rank Martial Spirits. You two, remember to try your best\u2014I will be watching your growth closely.\u201dAs the elder spoke, Huang Long\u2019s expression did not change, but a ghost of pride crept into Lin Zixiao\u2019s face.The other disciples present displayed their sense of jealousy and envy, but inside their heart, none of them felt it was unfair.After the elder spoke, he did not pay any attention to any other disciples, nor did he say anything unnecessary: \u201cI presume everyone present knows about the Trial of Versatility. It will commence in ten days\u2014at dawn all of you will gather here in the White Jade Dojo, waiting for orders.\u201d\\n The elder continues: \u201cWithin these ten days before the commencement of the competition, all of the new disciples are allowed to advance to the Martial Hall to receive their single opportunity to select a martial skill. Huang Long and Lin Zixiao will have two chances each. After selecting the skills, there will be designated disciples to greet and organize your accommodations to begin your cultivations.\u201dAs the elder finished his sentence\u2014without waiting for them to recover from the information given\u2014a stream of killing intent surged. In a cold voice, he said: \u201cApart from this, everyone must remember that if anyone dares to battle, or challenge each other to a duel, it will be treated as violating the rules and they will be exiled from the sect.As soon as he finished talking, the elder floated away without staying an extra second, as if nobody other than Lin Zixiao and Huang Long was worthy of his attention.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This Qin Nan is indeed a natural born Martial Addict; if something is relevant to Martial Skills, everything else is no longer a concern for him.Despite that, it was also part of the reason Xiao Qingxue was so fond of him.\u201cThe Skills Library of the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2026 does not only store Martial Skills,\u201d Xiao Qingxue continued with a faint smile, \u201cYou can also find the cultivation notes left by powerful cultivators of the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2014these are extremely precious. As for the rules of the Skills Library, you will learn them once you enter.\u201d\u201cCultivation notes left by powerful cultivators?\u201d Qin Nan unconsciously clenched his fists in excitement.Being one of the top four sects of the Luo River Kingdom, the Mystic Spirit Sect possessed a long history and a rich heritage; the number of powerful cultivators from the Mystic Spirit Sect was uncountable.If this was the case, how many books of cultivation notes left by powerful cultivators were stored in the Skills Library?\\nWhen she saw his reaction, Xiao Qingxue was unsure of how to feel, as she continued, \u201cFor this trip to the Skills Library, remember that you must exit after five days. I\u2019ll be waiting for you outside.\u201dAfter saying this, Xiao Qingxue\u2019s expression turned serious, as she said, \u201cQin Nan, your current cultivation base is too weak. You shouldn\u2019t focus only on Martial Skills\u2014you must improve your cultivation base.\u201dAfter he heard this, Qin Nan\u2019s face returned to normal, and he said immediately, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Qingxue. I\u2019ll be back in five days.\u201dAfter hearing Qin Nan\u2019s promise, Xiao Qingxue let out a relieved sigh and was going to give some advice. However, when she raised her head, she could no longer see Qin Nan, who had vanished into thin air.As soon as he knew that there were a lot of cultivation notes in the Skills Library, Qin Nan did not plan to waste any more time, and rushed straight to it.Not long after, Qin Nan arrived at the Skills Library.A huge palace in the shape of a pagoda stood firmly before him; it had eight floors in total, which went straight up toward the clouds.On the top of the palace, it felt like there was a large, invisible formation in action; the palace looked ordinary at first sight, but after looking at it for some time, one would feel tiny and reverent before it.Meanwhile, a kind-looking old man sat at the entrance of the Skills Library. Some new disciples had already gathered before the old man.\u201cThis old man\u2026\u201dQin Nan frowned his eyebrows. Since his Divine Battle Spirit had reached the eighth-grade Huang rank, his eyes had gained a new magical power.In his vision, this friendly-looking old man\u2014who was like your elderly neighbour\u2014possessed a terrifying power within his body; this power was more terrifying and intimidating than the one possessed by the white-haired elder at the White Jade Dojo.\\n\u201cI never thought that this old man guarding the entrance of the Skills Library would have a higher cultivation base than an elder of the Mystic Spirit Sect.\u201dAfter his discovery, Qin Nan took a deep breath and withdrew his gaze.In a blink of the eye, the disciples had all entered the Skills Library\u2014it was now Qin Nan\u2019s turn.With one large step, Qin Nan came up to the friendly-looking old man and held his fists together, \u201cDisciple Qin Nan pays respect to elder.\u201dThe old man raised his head and scanned Qin Nan with deep eyes while he smiled faintly, \u201cI\u2019m not an elder\u2014I\u2019m just an ordinary old man. You can call me \u2018Old Shan\u2019 next time. You\u2019re Qin Nan, right? Not bad for a young lad\u2014enter with haste.\u201dWhen he heard this, Qin Nan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. This Old Shan seems like he knew I was inspecting him with my eyes?With this flash of thought, Qin Nan did not spend any more time thinking about it, and instantly said, \u201cThanks, Old Shan.\u201dAfter saying this, he did not stay any longer and stepped through the Skill Library\u2019s entrance.Old Shan gazed at the disappearing Qin Nan; a flicker appeared within his deep eyes as he laughed, \u201cWhat an interesting disciple; being able to inspect me with at the fifth-floor Body Tempering Realm. Interesting, very interesting.\u201d\u2026\u2026As soon as Qin Nan entered the first floor of the Skills Library, he was utterly shocked at the sight before him.The first floor of the Skills Library had the appearance of a crystal palace; the floor, the desks, and the staircase were all made from a type of transparent crystal, which was eye dazzling.Besides this, the desks of the first floor were filled with ancient books; every ancient book was labeled with the words \u2018Ultimate Martial Skill\u2019.\\n\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Qin Nan deeply inhaled and recovered from the shock. His eyes were filled with excitement, \u201cThere are at least ten thousand Martial Skills here on the first floor. What kind of cultivation notes left by powerful cultivators can be found on the second floor, the third floor, the fourth floor\u2026 or even the eighth floor?\u201dEven someone who had reached the peak of the Ocean Qi Realm would still need to rely on Ultimate Martial Skills.Only those who had become Martial Emperors would find Ultimate Martial Skills to be useless.\u201cScrew it, no point thinking about it. I should check these Ultimate Martial Skills out. I should find a suitable one.\u201d Qin Nan swiftly collected his thoughts and started looking through the books.He spent five hours looking through the books.In these five hours, Qin Nan was fully immersed in the Ultimate Martial Skills. Even though he did not learn any of them, his knowledge and experience were greatly increased after reading the training methods of these Ultimate Martial Skills.\u201cThese Ultimate Martial Skills are indeed powerful; however, there\u2019s nothing for sabers\u2026\u201dQin Nan let out a wry smile after realizing this.In the five hours of looking through at least a thousand Martial Skills, he did not find any saber Martial Skills.\u201cI should keep looking.\u201d Qin Nan was quick to calm himself, and continued the search.Despite that, suddenly a wicked voice could be heard, \u201cI was just guessing who this was; isn\u2019t this Qin Nan? It seems like us two are sharing fateful encounters, stumbling into each other after leaving the White Jade Dojo only a little while ago.Qin Nan turned around and found the person to be Ling Zixiao.Ling Zixiao was not alone; behind him stood a number of new disciples, creating massive pressure, just like stars revolving around the moon.\\nQin Nan frowned\u2014he knew who these new disciples behind Ling Zixiao were; they were the geniuses he told himself to be aware of.What Qin Nan did not expect was that Ling Zixiao would be able to convince these geniuses to follow him in such a short period of time.\u201cSo it turns out to be you, Ling Zixiao.\u201d Qin Nan still showed no sign of respect as he calmly said, \u201cDo you have a problem? If not, I will excuse myself.\u201d After saying this, Qin Nan instantly turned around and walked away.When they saw this, Ling Zixiao and the other geniuses\u2019 eyes burned with rage.This Qin Nan is so cocky, leaving as he pleases, not giving us any respect!Even though Ling Zixiao was filled with fury, he did not dare to do anything here. He smirked and said in a sarcastic tone, \u201cWhy are you in a rush? Could it be that you\u2019re frightened? Aren\u2019t you, Qin Nan, super confident in yourself? I thought you would have something up your sleeve, but it turned out to be nothing. Without Xiao Qingxue\u2019s protection, you are revealing your true colors\u2014simply trash.\u201dQin Nan\u2019s steps slowed to a stop, as an icy expression rose in his eyes.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Despite that, in order to suck up to Mo Li, he had bothered and mocked Qin Nan continuously. If it were not for the restrictions of the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2019s rules, this Ling Zixiao would even have attacked him.However, Qin Nan did not lose his cool.Due to the fact that Ling Zixiao possessed a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and a cultivation base of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, Qin Nan was nowhere close to matching his power.Even though he was too weak to face his opponent, Qin Nan would never show his enemies any mercy verbally. He turned around immediately and said with a wry smile, \u201cLing Zixiao, is bullying others the only thing you can do? When Huang Long dared you to battle him, you chose to keep silent, as timid as a rat. When Xiao Qingxue released her anger, you chose to be oblivious to it, as you were afraid. What right do you\u2014a coward\u2014have to judge me?\u201dQin Nan spoke rapidly; it was like a stream of pinballs firing onto Ling Zixiao\u2019 body.When they heard this, Ling Zixiao and his crew twisted their faces.They never expected Qin Nan\u2019s mouth to release such scathing criticisms.This was especially so for Ling Zixiao, who felt a surge of hatred rising in his chest, but did not know how he could make a rebuttal; his face turned cold as he held in his animosity in agony.\u201cQin Nan\u2026\u201d After trying to hold in this animosity for a while, a word finally squeezed out from Ling Zixiao\u2019s mouth, who then let out a deep roar filled with a murderous aura, \u201cYou are just a piece of trash in my eyes. Who gave you the courage to talk to me like that?\u201d\\nLing Zixiao had completely shown his true colors, and clenched his fists so tight that his knuckles could be heard cracking; he was longing to attack this ruthless Qin Nan and kill him straight away.However, with the strict rules of the Mystic Spirit Sect, even the furious Ling Zixiao did not dare to do anything\u2014he could only bear with it!\u201cNo noise is allowed in the Skills Library.\u201d At that moment, a regal voice was heard, causing Ling Zixiao and his crew to grow shocked expressions.As the voice finished speaking, everyone felt as though their eyes were briefly blinded; they then saw an old man appearing out of nowhere before them.This old man was the one guarding the entrance to the Skills Library; he was Old Shan, who was in charge of recording the entries of the disciples.Old Shan briefly scanned the shocked faces of Qin Nan, Ling Zixiao, and the others before saying calmly, \u201cIf you have any conflict with each other, you can choose to have a Martial Talent Battle to decide the winner between you both. If you are not going to have a Martial Talent Battle, and continue to make more noise, you will be treated as breaking the rules and will be kicked out of the Skills Library.\u201dEveryone still had blank expressions on their faces. Without a doubt, they were totally flabbergasted by the sudden appearance of Old Shan.Qin Nan was stunned too, but as he already knew that Old Shan was no ordinary man, he was faster to recover from the shock, and said immediately, \u201cOld Shan, I will not repeat this mistake again.\u201dLing Zixiao and the others collected their thoughts and instantly apologized with their foreheads covered in cold sweat.How could they dare to oppose someone who can appear out of nowhere?\\nAfter Qin Nan finished his words, instead of spending time worrying about Ling Zixiao and his crew, he held his fists together and asked, \u201cOld Shan, what is the Martial Talent Battle you mentioned just now?\u201dAs Qin Nan had already listed Ling Zixiao as his \u2018must-kill\u2019 target, if the opportunity arose, Qin Nan would surely deal him a thunderous blow.This was the reason why Qin Nan asked the question.Old Shan let out a gentle smile and said, \u201cThe Martial Talent Battle is to compare Martial Skill talents. Everyone possesses different levels of Martial Skill talents since they were born. In our Skills Library, there exists an \u2018Ocean Crescent Boulder\u2019, which is able to detect one\u2019s Martial Skill talent.\u201dAs Old Shan finished his sentence, before Qin Nan had a chance to say anything, Ling Zixiao spoke immediately, \u201cComparing Martial Skill talents? Tsk, tsk, this Martial Talent Battle is quite interesting.\u201dAfter saying this, Ling Zixiao raised his head and looked disdainfully at Qin Nan, \u201cWeren\u2019t you cocky previously? How about we settle it with this Martial Talent Battle?\u201dHe paused momentarily before a grin appeared on his face, \u201cOf course, I\u2019m not forcing you to\u2014since you are a piece of trash, I understand if your Martial Skill talent is shit.\u201dWith Ling Zixiao\u2019s current attitude, almost everyone on the scene could guess that Ling Zixiao was also extremely talented in Martial Skills, giving him such confidence.It was as people guessed\u2014Ling Zixiao\u2019s Martial Skill talent was indeed powerful.Being born with great Martial Skill talent was not all Ling Zixiao had; his Fiery Flute Martial Spirit was not only able to kill with sound, it could also boost Ling Zixiao\u2019s comprehension, spirit, and his Martial Skill talent!That basically meant that\u2014in terms of Martial Skill talent\u2014Ling Zixiao would never back down, even if he was facing a tenth-grade Huang ranked, or even a Xuan ranked super-genius.\\nTherefore, when Ling Zixiao heard the explanation of the Martial Talent Battle from Old Shan, he almost cracked up laughing.This Martial Talent Battle is perfectly designed for me!All the disciples present looked toward Qin Nan disdainfully.With Ling Zixiao showing such confidence, he surely possesses a great Martial Skill talent. Under such circumstances, would you, Qin Nan, run away cowardly, or choose to accept the challenge and brace yourself for the oncoming shame?After seeing Qin Nan remain silent, Ling Zixiao\u2019s aura grew more arrogant, \u201cSo Qin Nan, do you dare to accept the challenge? If not, then get out of my sight.\u201dQin Nan let out a sudden laugh after seeing this reaction and said, \u201cYou want to compete in Martial Skill talent with me? Very well, I accept the challenge, but on one condition.\u201dUpon saying this, he hesitated a little, as an evil grin appeared on his face, \u201cIf you want to challenge me, let\u2019s make it a bet instead. Whoever loses will be prohibited from entering the Skills Library for the rest of their life!\u201dAfter hearing these words, Ling Zixiao and the other disciples twisted their faces.Even Old Shan raised his eyebrows slightly.They had never thought that, after Ling Zixiao\u2019s over-confident appearance, Qin Nan would instead turn it into a heavy bet.The one who loses will be prohibited from entering the Skills Library for the rest of their life.This Qin Nan, is he insane?After seeing the crowd fall into silence, Qin Nan smirked coldly and used precisely Ling Zixiao\u2019s own words against him, \u201cSo Ling Zixiao, do you dare to accept the challenge? If not, then get out of my sight!\u201dIn that instant, the faces of Ling Zixiao and his crew grew even more contorted.Ling Zixiao took a deep breath\u2014sweat could be seen forming on his cold face. If he did not accept the challenge, he would not have any reputation or fame left in the Mystic Spirit Sect.\\nAs a result, he had no choice but to accept the challenge!\u201cVery well, I agree to the bet!\u201d Ling Zixiao laughed sinisterly and said, \u201cIf you wish to not enter the Skills Library for the rest of your life, I don\u2019t mind lending a hand. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what sorcery a piece of trash like you has up their sleeves!\u201dLing Zixiao\u2019s ferocious aura reappeared.With my natural born Martial Skill talent, and with the help of my ninth-grade Huang ranked Fiery Flute Martial Spirit, why would I be scared of Qin Nan?So what if this Qin Nan was hiding something?Ling Zixiao could not believe that Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Skill talent would be more powerful than his!Old Shan gave Qin Nan a thoughtful look before he smilingly said, \u201cIf you two have no objections, I now declare the Martial Talent Battle to be valid. Even if either of you has second thoughts during the battle, then you will still be prohibited from entering the Skills Library for the rest of your life.

Where does his confidence come from?\u201d\u201cIn my opinion, this Qin Nan is completely out of his mind.\u201d\u201cI think so too. Ling Zixiao is a super genius with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit; how is Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Skill talent comparable to his?\u201d\u201cLooks like Qin Nan is about to go down hard, not being allowed to enter the Skills Library for the rest of his life.\u201d\u201cHAHA, serves him right.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHearing the conversations around him, Ling Zixiao\u2019s face grew even more conceited, as if he were sure to win this Martial Talent Battle.On the other hand, Qin Nan\u2019s face was calm like the water\u2019s surface, as if he did not hear the people mocking him.Old Shan scanned the crowd with a glance, but did not say a word; he then waved his hand, and a huge boulder appeared out of nowhere.The boulder was the height of a man, with the color of ocean blue just like the sea; in the middle of the boulder was a crescent, which looked like the reflection of the moon on the surface of the sea.Everyone\u2019s eyes were filled with astonishment.Apart from being surprised at the boulder itself, they all had a more shocking question, how did this boulder appear?Even Qin Nan\u2019s face showed confusion.Not only could this Old Shan appear suddenly, he could also make a boulder appear out of nowhere. What kind of sorcery was this? What was his real identity?\\nOld Shan was not influenced by the stunned expressions of the crowd; he smiled calmly and said, \u201cThis boulder is the one I mentioned before: the Ocean Crescent Boulder. When you place your palm on the boulder, this Ocean Crescent Boulder will emit different types of light based on your Martial Skill talent. Before the Martial Talent Battle starts, I would like to tell you in advance that the lights emitted from the Ocean Crescent Boulder are classified into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet\u2014seven colors\u2014with red being the lowest grade and so on, with violet as the highest grade!\u201dThe new disciples at the scene nodded their heads respectively, as an indication that they understood.Of course, they had no way to attest to this, but besides, why would such a powerful person lie to them?Old Shan glanced at Qin Nan and Ling Zixiao and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s first?\u201d\u201cMe, of course.\u201d Ling Zixiao\u2019s face was filled with pride as he stepped forward and gave Old Shan a respectful bow, before scanning the crowd. His gaze stopped on Qin Nan as he smirked disdainfully, \u201cQin Nan, open your eyes and watch closely the grade of my Martial Skill talent; check out the color it possesses!\u201dAfter saying this, Ling Zixiao reached his hand out with extreme confidence and placed his palm on top of the Ocean Crescent Boulder.As soon as his palm touched the huge rock, the Ocean Blue Boulder emitted a buzzing sound. Immediately after, blue colored light rays filled the whole area.Everyone opened their eyes wide; Ling Zixiao\u2019s Martial Skill talent has reached the blue color grade?Even Old Shan had a slightly shocked expression on his face as he said, \u201cBlue light rays, your Martial Skill talent isn\u2019t bad.\u201dEveryone at the scene had their eyes filled with astonishment once again.\\nBeing acknowledged by Old Shan means that Ling Zixiao\u2019s Martial Skill talent is overwhelming!\u201cHAHAHA, Old Shan, my Martial Skill talent does not stop here!\u201d Ling Zixiao let out a sudden laugh as a proud aura was felt from him.Behind him, nine golden rays were seen, together with a Fiery Flute that slowly appeared among the golden rays.After Ling Zixiao had unleashed his Martial Spirit, the Fiery Flute started to produce a sound even though no one was blowing into it; it was such a pleasant and pure sound that it caused people\u2019s minds and spirits to feel refreshed.In that instant, the blue rays emitted from the Ocean Crescent Boulder suddenly transformed into blinding indigo rays, causing the new disciples to feel a slight pain in their eyes.After a three second silence, the whole crowd exploded.\u201cIndigo rays! Ling Zixiao\u2019s Martial Skill talent has reached the indigo-grade!\u201d\u201cOh my god, who could have known that Ling Zixiao\u2019s Martial Spirit has the ability to boost his comprehension toward Martial Skills.\u201d\u201cWow, a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit is indeed extremely powerful!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNot only was the crowd dumbfounded, even Old Shan\u2019s eyes were filled with a hint of surprise as he said, \u201cBeing born with a blue Martial Skill talent, and apart from that, able to boost your Martial Skill talent to indigo level with the help of your Martial Spirit\u2014not bad, not bad, not bad indeed!\u201dEven Old Shan said three \u2018not bad\u2019s in a row.Based on Old Shan\u2019s attitude, it was obvious how powerful an indigo-grade Martial Skill talent was.\u201cHAHAHA, thank you Old Shan!\u201d Ling Zixiao laughed loudly and gave Old Shan a respectful bow; at the same time, his gaze fell onto Qin Nan.At this moment, Ling Zixiao\u2019s eyes were completely filled with disdain and disrespect, and\u2014as if he were looking at an ant\u2014he said, \u201cQin Nan, weren\u2019t you being cocky? Today, I look forward to seeing what color grade your Martial Skill talent possesses. Of course, you can choose to surrender now; if you kneel on the ground and give me ten kowtows, I will not force you to keep your words. You will still be allowed to enter the Skills Library for the rest of your life!\u201d\\nAfter hearing these words, all the disciples collected their thoughts and their vision focused on Qin Nan.Their gazes were filled with disdain and scorn, excited to watch the drama.This Qin Nan, not only does he dare to compete in Martial Spirit talent with Ling Zixiao, he even suggests the loser be prohibited to enter the Skills Library for the rest of his life\u2014is he tired of living?Old Shan could not help but gently shake his head too.Initially, he had thought that Qin Nan would give him a surprise, but he was now sure to lose facing Ling Zixiao\u2019s Martial Skill talent.The others might not know, but Old Shan was clear that\u2014among the disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2014there were only three of them, including Ling Zixiao, who possessed indigo-grade Martial Skill talents.The other two were both core disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2014the real super-geniuses!\u201cLing Zixiao, who on Earth is giving you the courage to mock people like this?\u201d Qin Nan had a disdainful expression, and went a big step forward while saying, \u201cLing Zixiao, please remember this; there will always be a person stronger than you in this world. Do you think your indigo-grade Martial Skill talent is the best in this world? Let me assure you, your thoughts are too naive.\u201d\u201cYou\u2014\u2014\u201d Ling Zixiao\u2019s face contorted, as flames of anger were ignited in his chest.Why is this Qin Nan so cocky even at this stage, saying such disrespectful words? Do you really think your Martial Skill talent has surpassed the indigo-grade and reached the violet-grade?Apart from Ling Zixiao, the disciples in the surroundings were furious too.This Qin Nan is really stubborn; he dares to feel smug at this point!However, as the crowd was furious, Qin Nan reached out his hand and placed his palm on top of the Ocean Crescent Boulder. A hint of red light was seen flashing weakly on the Ocean Crescent Boulder.\\nAfter seeing this, everyone was stunned, including Old Shan.Red light? The lowest grade of Martial Skill talent?Almost everyone in that instant felt it was ridiculous in their mind.What the f**k, the lowest rank of Martial Skill talent. This Qin Nan still dares to talk shit here, and even came up with the bet of not entering the Skills Library for the rest of his life.Where did his courage come from? Who gave him the courage to do so?Ling Zixiao was stunned for three breaths\u2019 time, before recovering from the shock. The flames of anger previously burning on his chest were gone; they were replaced by a sense of amusement, causing him to laugh crazily as he failed to endure it, \u201cHAHAHA, I f**king thought you have something up in your sleeves. Red light? The trashiest grade of Martial Skill talent; how dare you to be so co\u2014\u201dLing Zixiao did not finish the word \u2018cocky\u2019.The crowd failed to react in time.The rays of red light emitted from the Ocean Crescent Boulder instantly expanded, just like enraged beasts.The color of the rays instantly turned from red into orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo\u2014until it reached violet.Suddenly, the magnificent violet rays from the Ocean Crescent Boulder fired upward, as if a powerful emperor were at the scene; a strong reverent aura appeared, which covered the whole first floor of the Skills Library, the Hall made of crystals.Under the bright illumination of the rays, the first floor Hall of Crystal was covered in violet.The hall had transformed into a violet-colored ocean!At that moment, everyone was completely surprised, shaken, stricken.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For this Martial Talent Battle, you are the winner!\u201dThe new disciples at the scene recovered from the shock after hearing this.Their gazes toward Qin Nan were different now; they were filled with respect and fear, as if they were looking at the top genius of the world.Not only that, they were incredibly regretful; Why were we mocking Qin Nan before? Why did we mock a super genius with the highest-grade Martial Skill talent?Such a joke\u2014it\u2019s ridiculous!Ling Zixiao had collected his thoughts too. However, his eyes still had a blank appearance\u2014an unbelieving appearance.I, Ling Zixiao, have failed?I, Ling Zixiao, have been defeated by Qin Nan?This Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Skill talent has reached the highest-grade, surpassing even those geniuses with Xuan ranked Martial Spirits?How\u2026 How is this possible? Is this\u2026 Is this a dream?\\nQin Nan nodded at Old Shan and withdrew his hand. The violet light rays which filled the whole Hall of Crystal were finally vanishing, returning it to a calm state.Qin Nan\u2019s sight was directed toward Ling Zixiao; it was expressionless, filled with coldness.This Ling Zixiao took the initiative to challenge me to a Martial Talent Battle; not only that, did he really try to mock me?I, Qin Nan, am a natural born Martial Addict, and with the help of my Divine Battle Spirit\u2026 where did this Ling Zixiao get his courage from to challenge me to a Martial Talent Battle?If you\u2019re looking for a quick death, don\u2019t blame me if I show no mercy.Qin Nan let out a cold smirk. Instead of saying anything excessive, he only said two words in a cold tone, \u201cPiss off!\u201dAfter hearing the words, Ling Zixiao\u2019s face contorted and his body quivered.An enormous sense of disgrace rose up in Ling Zixiao\u2019s heart, causing him to build a murderous intent; he was consumed by the flames of anger, driving him to verge of losing his mind.Since when had he\u2014Ling Zixiao, a ninth-grade Huang ranked genius\u2014faced such disgrace before?At the same time, Old Shan\u2014who was aware of Ling Zixiao\u2019s reaction\u2014said coldly, \u201cQin Nan is the winner in this Martial Talent Battle. Ling Zixiao, from today onward, you are prohibited from entering the Skills Library for the rest of your life. If you dare to come, death will be your penalty!\u201dAfter hearing these words, Ling Zixiao\u2019s body shivered, his eyes filled with fear.Even though he felt like exploding in fury, he would not dare be disrespectful toward this mysterious Old Shan.\u201cYes\u2026\u201dLing Zixiao squeezed the word out from his teeth with a dull expression; he gave Qin Nan a death stare while clenching his fists.\\nNow that the outcome had been declared, it would be more embarrassing if he continued to stay in this Skills Library.\u201cQin Nan, during the Trial of Versatility, I\u2019ll make sure you suffer and beg for your death!\u201dLing Zixiao growled in his heart and exited the Skills Library swiftly.Those new disciples who were following Ling Zixiao previously looked at each other as they felt their faces burning red; without any further intention to stay in the Skills Library, they pushed toward the exit in a rush.After Ling Zixiao and his group of new disciples left, a deafening hubbub broke out suddenly among the others who came to spectate.\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s incredible\u2014this Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Skill talent is so terrifying!\u201d\u201cEven Ling Zixiao, who had a natural born great Martial Skill talent, together with the support from his ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2026\u2026 even he lost to Qin Nan.\u201d\u201cWhew, this violet-grade Martial Skill talent is even considered rare in the Mystic Spirit Sect, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Nan\u2019s face remained neutral as he listened to the discussion; not even the littlest sense of happiness was felt in his heart.This was because he clearly knew that these people only respected him after he had shown his power. If you appeared to be weak, they would bully, mock, and make fun of you.Therefore\u2014as usual\u2014Qin Nan chose to ignore them.Old Shan gave Qin Nan a thoughtful look; he had now calmed himself down, and he smilingly said, \u201cThis is not the place to talk. So, would you be interested in coming with me?\u201dQin Nan was respectful toward Old Shan at all times, and he said while holding his fists together, \u201cDisciple Qin Nan awaits your order.\u201d\u201cWhat order? Come\u2014follow me. I have something to say.\u201d\\nAfter saying this, Old Shan immediately pulled Qin Nan\u2019s hand and rushed toward the exit.The new disciples in the Skills Library had their eyes filled with jealousy after they saw this.Through Old Shan\u2019s navigation, Qin Nan followed him to a pagoda located beside the Skills Library.The pagoda was two levels tall, with numerous large trees planted around it, which rustled as the wind started blowing. In front of the pagoda, there lay a pond with colorful fish swimming around in it.\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d Qin Nan exclaimed before saying, \u201cTo find such elegant pagoda in the Mystic Spirit Sect.\u201d\u201cStop with the flattering; I know I\u2019m poor to have built it like this.\u201d Old Shan snapped jokingly, but then in a serious tone he said, \u201cQin Nan, the reason I invited you here is because I have something for you.\u201d\u201cSomething for me?\u201d Qin Nan was slightly flabbergasted.\u201cYes\u2014it is this badge.\u201d Old Shan took out a red badge, and said with a smile, \u201cIf you hold on to this badge, you are free to enter the first floor and the second floor in the Skills Library; you are free to choose as many Martial Skills as you want, without any time constraint.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Qin Nan blurted out with a surprised expression.Normally, one would have to pay a huge price to be able to choose a Martial Skill from the Skills Library of the Mystic Spirit Sect.Even they, as new disciples, only had a chance to choose one.Despite that, with this badge which Old Shan simply took out, he would be able to pick any Martial Skill, at any time?Qin Nan took a deep breath; he did not take the badge, but instead replied in a serious manner, \u201cOld Shan, this gift is too valuable. I could not accept it if you haven\u2019t even told me the reason.\u201d\\nOld Shan smiled, and said with a nostalgic expression, \u201cThe reason? Nothing special really. It\u2019s just that I admire disciples with high Martial Skill talent. If your Martial Skill talent were able to trigger the rare occurrence of the Ocean Crescent Boulder, I would give you a much more powerful badge, giving you unlimited access to the whole Skills Library.\u201dAfter finishing the sentence, Old Shan added, \u201cApart from the seven color grades, there\u2019s actually an eighth grade on top of them, which is known as the \u2018rare occurrence\u2019 of the Ocean Crescent Boulder.\u201d\u201cAn unlimited-access badge to the Skills Library if one\u2019s Martial Skill talent is able to trigger the rare occurrence of the Ocean Crescent Boulder?\u201d Qin Nan reacted immediately; his eyes burned with passion as his stare was locked onto Old Shan.It was as if he were asking, Old Shan, you\u2019re not kidding right?After seeing Qin Nan\u2019s reaction, Old Shan burst out laughing and said, \u201cI have never given false hope with my words. So? Do you really think your Martial Skill talent is able to trigger the rare occurrence of the Ocean Crescent Boulder?\u201dAs he was saying this, there was no sign of expectation on Old Shan\u2019s face.What a joke, how terrifying would his Martial Skill talent be if he was able to trigger the rare occurrence of the Ocean Crescent Boulder?At least within the past hundred years, Old Shan had never witnessed any genius disciple able to trigger the rare occurrence of the Ocean Crescent Boulder.Even the core disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect failed to do so!Qin Nan, what makes you think that you can do it?Qin Nan smiled gently and said, \u201cOld Shan, I want to give it a try. You do know that I haven\u2019t unleashed my Martial Spirit yet.\u201d\\n\u201cUnleash your Martial Spirit?\u201d Old Shan was slightly surprised, before he then said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that your Martial Spirit could boost your Martial Skill talent too, huh? Tsk, tsk, Qin Nan, maybe you are the most talented in Martial Skills I have ever seen. However, even if your Martial Spirit can boost your Martial Skill talent, you still won\u2019t trigger the rare occurrence of the Ocean Crescent Boulder.\u201dAfter saying this, Old Shan shook his head.From Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation base, Old Shan could almost guess his Martial Spirit\u2019s grade to be within the seventh-grade Huang rank to ninth-grade Huang rank.Without a Xuan ranked Martial Spirit, even if your Martial Spirit could boost Martial Skill talent, by what margin could it improve?\u201cOld Shan, you will know the answer once I give it a try.\u201d Qin Nan said with a calm tone, which still contained a hint of pride, \u201cI think that it will not be a problem to trigger the rare occurrence with the help of my Martial Spirit.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dOld Shan did not look happy, This Qin Nan, even though he has a great Martial Skill talent, he is a bit too arrogant.Do you really think you can trigger the rare occurrence just because you have a violet-grade Martial Skill talent?This Qin Nan has no idea the gap between the violet-grade and the triggering of the rare occurrence of the Ocean Crescent Boulder\u0304\u2014he\u2019s so full of himself!Old Shan did not hesitate further; with a wave of his hand, the Ocean Crescent Boulder appeared once again. With a cold tone, he said, \u201cIf you are so keen to try, then go ahead.\u201dAfter saying this, Old Shan gave Qin Nan a placid gaze.If you choose to be ignorant, then I\u2019ll satisfy your request.\\nQin Nan was not bothered at all; he rose from his seat and placed his palm on top of the Ocean Crescent Boulder.Same as before, the Ocean Crescent Boulder emitted red light rays, which then turned into blinding violet light rays.With a command from his mind, eight golden rays appeared behind him; the Divine Battle Spirit could be seen floating within the rays, unleashing a forceful aura.\u201cWhat Martial Spirit is this?\u201d Old Shan was slightly astonished looking at the Divine Battle Spirit, before his expression changed and he said, \u201cWhat is happening? Are you really triggering the rare occurrence?\u201dOld Shan\u2019s gaze was focused on the scene before him.After Qin Nan had unleashed his Divine Battle Spirit, the Ocean Crescent Boulder started to vibrate, and released a buzzing sound, as if a mysterious force had been awakened within the boulder.Old Shan\u2019s body started to tremble.Ever since he had gotten a hold of the Ocean Crescent Boulder, he had never seen or heard of such reaction from it.It can\u2019t be. Did Qin Nan really trigger the rare occurrence after unleashing his Martial Spirit?However, following this, a \u2018BANG\u2019 was heard from the buzzing Ocean Crescent Boulder\u2014the huge boulder then exploded and shattered into pieces, dropping all around them.Qin Nan and Old Shan were dumbfounded by this scene.Did the Ocean Crescent Boulder really just shatter to pieces?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - The Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon BadgePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45 \u2013 The Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon BadgeThe reasons why Qin Nan wanted to try were; firstly, to get the badge which would allow him to enter the Skill Library freely; and secondly, he knew that the Divine Battle Spirit could boost his Martial Skill talent, and he was confident enough in the capability of his Divine Battle Spirit.However, Qin Nan had never expected it to turn out like this.In the end, not only did he not trigger the rare occurrence of the Ocean Crescent Boulder, did he really just end up shattering the boulder into pieces?After collecting his thoughts, Qin Nan swallowed his saliva and looked cautiously toward where Old Shan stood.Old Shan appeared to be staring at the pieces of the Ocean Crescent Boulder; his face alternating between turning pale-white and furious-red, as if he were performing a rapid face-changing trick.This scene caused Qin Nan\u2019s heart to beat faster.This Old Shan, will he ask me for compensation?Old Shan\u2019s face kept twitching.Previously, in order to get a hold of the Ocean Crescent Boulder, he had paid a huge price for it.Since then, he had treated the Ocean Crescent Boulder as one of his most precious treasures; even when some expert cultivators expressed their interest with insane prices, he had never thought of selling it.However, today\u2014just a moment ago\u2014his most precious treasure had shattered into pieces, and in such a ridiculous way.It made him feel like his heart was bleeding.\u201cQin Nan\u2026\u201d Old Shan took a deep breath, trying his very best to remain calm, and said, \u201cWhat happened just then isn\u2019t your fault. I will not ask you for compensation.\u201dAlthough he had tried his best to make himself sound calm, Qin Nan was able to detect a hint of murderous intent from the words.\\nAfter saying these words, Old Shan appeared to have a sudden realization\u2014his expression changed instantly, as he looked at Qin Nan with a gaze burning with intensity.Before that, Old Shan was heartbroken as his Ocean Crescent Boulder had just shattered before him, which distracted him from the most important question.This Qin Nan before him only possessed a cultivation of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm; even if he consumed all his energy, it should still be impossible to shatter the Ocean Crescent Boulder to pieces.If so, why did the Ocean Crescent Boulder shatter all of a sudden?The only explanation was that, when Qin Nan unleashed his Martial Spirit, his Martial Skill talent had exceeded the limit the Ocean Crescent Boulder was able to withstand.This gaze from Old Shan caused Qin Nan\u2019s expression to change, as he said, \u201cOld Shan, I didn\u2019t mean to do this. If you want me to compensate, I\u2019ll pay you after I have enough money in the future.\u201dUpon hearing this, Old Shan recovered from the shock and tried his best to conceal his astonishment. He calmly said, \u201cQin Nan, you are mistaken. I won\u2019t force you to compensate me for the Ocean Crescent Boulder. Quite the opposite\u2014I\u2019ll give you the Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge. With this badge, from today onward, you are allowed to enter every floor of the Skills Library at your own discretion; you can choose whatever Martial Skills you want.\u201cHuh?\u201d Qin Nan was stunned. What happened to Old Shan? Instead of blaming me, he is giving me such a valuable gift?After seeing Qin Nan\u2019s reaction, Old Shan could not help but snicker, while saying, \u201cQin Nan, why do you think the Ocean Crescent Boulder shattered all of a sudden? There\u2019s only one possibility\u2014your Martial Skill talent has exceeded the limit of the Ocean Crescent Boulder.\u201d\\nAfter hearing these words, Qin Nan finally understood. No wonder Old Shan did not blame me, but chose to give me the Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge. It\u2019s because my Martial Skill talent has exceeded the limit of the Ocean Crescent Boulder.With this, Qin Nan finally felt relieved; at the same time, a thought came to him once again\u2014his Divine Battle Spirit was absolutely terrifying.As Old Shan waved his hand, a badge appeared in it.The badge was similar to the previous one; it was purple in color, like a cloud of purple smoke. In addition to that, a roaring scarlet dragon head could be seen on the badge; it looked alive, and intimidating.Old Shan smiled gently and said, \u201cQin Nan, this badge is the Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge. Apart from being able to enter the Skills Library freely, you are also allowed to enter the Treasure Vault. However, if you want to enter the other halls, you would have to become a real disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect after participating in the Trial of Versatility.\u2019\u201cI can even enter the Treasure Vault?\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s expression changed.After he heard this, Qin Nan immediately realized that the power granted by this small Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge was more terrifying than his expectations.\u201cThank you, Old Shan. I will remember your kindness for sure.\u201d After hesitating momentarily, Qin Nan had decided to accept the badge without any further qualms.This badge was far too useful to Qin Nan.Old Shan nodded his head and said, \u201cQin Nan, even though you now have this Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge, you can only enter the third floor of the Skills Library. After your cultivation base improves, you will then be able to proceed to higher floors with this badge.\u201dAfter saying this, instead of wasting any more time talking, Old Shan waved his hand at Qin Nan and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not long before the Trial of Versatility take place. You should stop wasting time here, and leave now\u2014go and improve your cultivation.\u201d\\nQin Nan immediately gave Old Shan a respectful bow after hearing these words; he then left without saying anything else.In Qin Nan\u2019s view, Old Shan had given him such a huge gift on their first encounter; he would only be able to return such a favor after he had become an expert in the future.However, what Qin Nan did not know was that after he left, Old Shan was unable to conceal his feelings anymore\u2014he raised his head and burst out laughing.\u201cHAHAHAHA, I\u2019ve always thought that, in this world, it would be impossible to meet a disciple with a Martial Skill talent that can reach the highest-grade of the Ocean Crescent Boulder. However, someone has actually done it\u2014he even shattered the Ocean Crescent Boulder into pieces!\u201d After saying this, he raised his head again and his eyes turned teary, \u201cSenior Brother, I\u2019ve found the one you were looking for. When are you coming back?\u201dThe surroundings fell into silence; only the rustling of the trees could be heard as the wind blew past. There was no sign of anyone.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After excusing himself from Old Shan\u2019s place, Qin Nan headed straight toward the third floor of the Skills Library without hesitation.In Qin Nan\u2019s view, there was no longer any reason to go to the first and second floors of the Skills Library; he was excited and curious to see what he could find on the third floor.What kind of Martial Skills and cultivation notes can I find on this third floor?However, as he was about to enter the third floor, an old man dressed in a black robe appeared before him.This old man in a black robe was the guardian of the third floor.The old man glanced at Qin Nan\u2014a sense of disgust could be seen in his eyes. Disrespectful and shameless new disciples were disliked most by him.\\nThis is the third floor of the Skills Library; do these new disciples really think they are worthy enough to enter?The old man straightened his face and said in a cold tone, \u201cNew disciples are not allowed to enter the third floor. Leave now, or be prepared to be disciplined according to the sect rules.\u201dQin Nan immediately raised the Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge and calmly said, \u201cElder, I\u2019m not sure, but am I allowed to enter with this badge?\u201d\u201cLeave at\u2026.\u201d The old man snapped instantly, as he was too lazy to take a look. In his view, this new disciple had merely a cultivation base of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm\u2014what kind of background could he possess?Despite that, before the old man could finish his sentence with the word \u2018once\u2019, his expression changed rapidly after he glimpsed the badge accidentally. Countless droplets of cold sweat started to flow down his forehead.\u2018Is\u2026 Is this\u2026\u201d The old man\u2019s body started to tremble, while staring at the badge with an utterly shocked expression.The Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge? Is this really the badge? Where did this little new disciple get this Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge from?After seeing the old man\u2019s reaction, Qin Nan instantly knew that this Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge was nothing ordinary; he then said, \u201cSo elder, am I allowed to enter?\u201d\u201cYes-yes-yes-yes\u2026.\u201d The old man in the black robe nodded his head like a pecking chick. Despite being an elder, he somehow felt scared of Qin Nan\u2014he even made a polite gesture while telling him to enter.\u201cThank you, elder.\u201d Qin Nan held his fists toward the old man and entered the third floor.The old man was stunned on the spot, staring at the disappearing Qin Nan. It took a while for him to recover, before he then said to himself, \u201cWhere did this guy come from? A new disciple with a fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation appeared to have the legendary badge of a great elder. Does it mean\u2026 this young man\u2026 is the great elder\u2019s\u2026\u201d\\nAt this moment, the old man shut his mouth immediately, not daring to continue.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The scent enabled people to feel relaxed.On the third floor, there were around ten large bookshelves; every single shelf was filled with ancient-looking books.Qin Nan immediately approached one of the shelves and took a random book from it. A surprised expression appeared on his face after he took his first glimpse.He saw a line in the book saying, \u201cJiang Liu,\u2014inner disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2014had remarkable thoughts while practicing the Ultimate Martial Skill: Mystic Homing Saber Art. Thus, they are recorded in this book to be kept in the Skills Library.\u201d\u201cI never thought that the book I randomly selected on this third floor would transpire to be a cultivation note from a Martial Emperor inner disciple.\u201d Qin Nan exclaimed, after recovering from the surprise.Immediately after, he could not help but feel excited.The cultivation notes of Martial Emperor Realm experts were incredibly precious and rare; ordinary people would have a hard time finding one.In the meantime, a voice full of curiosity was heard, \u201cA new disciple?\u201dUpon hearing the voice, Qin Nan turned around and saw an ordinary-looking young man.However, Qin Nan\u2019s vision was no longer the same as before\u2014it had a special capability. He instantly detected the presence of a strong force within the young man\u2019s body.Qin Nan was slightly staggered; the cultivation base of this young man had reached the Martial Emperor Realm\u2014it felt stronger than Mo Li\u2019s, even significantly stronger than Xiao Qingxue\u2019s.What Qin Nan did not know was that the young man experienced an even bigger shock in his mind.\\nThis was the third floor of the Skills Library; it was extremely difficult for even an outer disciple to enter here.This one before him was only a new disciple with a cultivation of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm. How did he enter the third floor?Just as the young man was filled with doubt, his eyes discovered the Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge hanging on Qin Nan\u2019s waist.With this glimpse, the face of the ordinary young man changed immediately\u2014it was filled with utter shock.Could this be the badge of a great elder?This new disciple before me, why does he have the great elder\u2019s badge? Who on Earth is this guy?Luckily, the ordinary-looking young man had a strong mind, and soon recovered from the shock, before smilingly said, \u201cI\u2019m Gong Yang, an inner disciple of the sect. How should I address you?\u201dIt was the first time Qin Nan had met Gong Yang. Qin Nan kind of liked his easy-going attitude; he held his fists together and said, \u201cSenior Brother Gong Yang, my name is Qin Nan.\u201d\u201cAh, so you\u2019re Brother Qin Nan.\u201d Gong Yang nodded his head and grinned saying, \u201cBrother Qin Nan, the badge on your waist; please avoid showing it so easily, it\u2019s quite terrifying.\u201dQin Nan was stunned, but soon came to understand, and smilingly said, \u201cThank you for the reminder.\u201dThis Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge was nothing ordinary with the power it possessed; if other disciples were to see it, it was sure that Qin Nan\u2019s name would be made known to the whole Mystic Spirit Sect.With Qin Nan\u2019s low-key personality, he would not like to be under the spotlight, causing rumors to spread.\u201cBrother Qin Nan, did you come to the third floor to look for cultivation notes or skill books?\u201d Gong Yang smiled and changed the topic.\\nThis Qin Nan is not conceited; he\u2019s a straightforward guy that doesn\u2019t disguise his personality. Gong Yang had a good impression of Qin Nan; hence, he didn\u2019t mind being friends with Qin Nan.Being friends with someone who had the great elder\u2019s badge was never a bad thing.Qin Nan nodded his head and said, \u201cTo be honest with you, I am here to look for cultivation notes about Saber Arts. I\u2019m happy if there are skill books related to Saber Martial Skills too.\u201cSaber Martial Skills?\u201d Gong Yang paused for a while, and said hesitatingly, \u201cI do know there\u2019s a Saber Martial Skill. It\u2019s a self-invented skill, and contains cultivation notes describing the experience of practicing it too. It\u2019s one of the best if you want to improve your mastery of the Saber Art. The thing is, you would need a great Martial Skill Talent to learn it\u2026\u201dUpon hearing these words, Qin Nan\u2019s eyes flickered. He had never expected to find a self-invented Saber Martial Skill on the third floor of the Skills Library.Qin Nan instantly ignored Gong Yang\u2019s last sentence and urged him, \u201cCan brother help me find this skill book?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 No problem at all.\u201d Gong Yang hesitated briefly. He did not expect this Qin Nan to interrupt his last sentence like that; he then said, \u201cIf you are keen, I\u2019ll go and get it for you.\u201dGong Yang then turned around and flipped through one of the bookshelves, and pulled out a book from it.Qin Nan immediately took the book and glanced at the title; on the front of the book was written: \u201cA self-invented Martial Skill: Flying Saber Art. Learning it will grant you the ability to kill opponents stronger than yourself.\u201dEven though there were not much description, a sense of confidence and domination could be felt.\\nWith just this glimpse, Qin Nan was immediately attracted to it.\u201cSenior brother, allow me to check this \u2018Flying Saber Art\u2019 out.\u201d Qin Nan gave Gong Yang a heads up and sat down instantly. He could not wait to start reading the ancient-looking skill book.Gong Yang was stunned once again; he never thought that this Junior Brother Qin Nan would have such outstanding behavior\u2014desperate to learn the Martial Skill just after he got the skill book.Gong Yang found it quite hilarious, but when his gaze fell onto Qin Nan, a surprised expression was seen in his eyes again, \u201cNatural born Martial Addict?\u201dQin Nan was fully focused on reading the skill book; at times, he would smirk, or have deep thoughts, or release a murderous aura. He appeared to be completely lost in his own world, separated from reality.Gong Yang took another deep breath.In his first glimpse of Qin Nan, he had been staggered after seeing the Great Elder\u2019s badge on him. However, at that moment, he only guessed that Qin Nan had a powerful background.Hence, Gong Yang had never expected Qin Nan to be a natural born Martial Addict. If someone were to be fond of Martial Skill since being born, the person would have a great Martial Skill Talent.The others might not know, but Gong Yang was clear on the significance of being a natural born Martial Addict\u2014the significance of having great Martial Skill Talent.Even though in the Canglan Continent, being a natural born Martial Addict was not as important as the grade of one\u2019s Martial Spirit. However, natural born Martial Addicts had the capability to have breakthroughs in battle, causing one\u2019s power to increase incredibly to turn the tables\u2014it was terrifying indeed.\u201cWhen the time comes, I\u2019ll make sure to be good friends with Qin Nan.\u201d Gong Yang made up his mind. The reason was that Qin Nan possessed a Great Elder\u2019s badge, which alone was enough to let Gong Yang be fearful toward Qin Nan\u2019s identity.\\nNow, Qin Nan had won Gong Yang\u2019s favor after making this good impression.If the outer and inner disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect knew that the new disciple Qin Nan had won the favor of Gong Yang, it would cause a huge uproar in the Mystic Spirit Sect; Qin Nan\u2019s name would be famous too.Despite that, Qin Nan in his current stance found it impossible to know Gong Yang\u2019s thought process; his mind was fully focused on the Flying Saber Art.This ancient skill book did not merely record the Martial Skill, Flying Saber Art; it also contained the discoveries and cultivation notes of the skill book\u2019s author.Both the Flying Saber Art and the cultivation notes regarding the skill were seen as delicacies for Qin Nan; it continued to attract Qin Nan, causing him to be fully immersed in learning the Martial Skill, unable to control himself.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - Saber Intent PerfectionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 47 \u2013 Saber Intent Perfection\u201cThe one invented this Flying Saber Art must be a genius. There\u2019s only one variation of this Flying Saber Art, which is named \u2018Hundred Steps Soaring Saber\u2019. Once it\u2019s executed, the saber would be fired, and would decapitate the target within a range of hundred steps; it\u2019s extremely imperious, possessing terrifying power. However, to learn this skill, accurate eyesight and firm determination are compulsory.\u201d\u201cApart from this Flying Saber Art, there are also cultivation notes about Saber Arts written in this ancient skill book.\u201d\u201cI see, for Saber Arts, apart from being imperious, it has to be agile and flexible with variations too, giving an opponent a hard time to defend and predict it. I misunderstood it while I was practicing the Thundercrash Saber Art before; I assumed the execution of a Saber Art must be fast, precise and powerful; nothing more. However, as the condition of a battle changes rapidly and unpredictably, it is important to execute the most suitable Saber Art according to the situation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile Qin Nan was flipping through the pages of the skill book, lots of thoughts were appearing in his mind, expanding his knowledge.However, even Qin Nan did not notice that at this same time, a ferocious saber aura could be seen floating around him.The scene had caught the attention of Gong Yang who was standing aside; a flicker was seen in his eyes as he thought, \u201cThis guy is indeed a natural born Martial Addict\u2014he\u2019s able to have a grasp of Saber Intent with just a cultivation base of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm, and reach the Greater Success Stage of One with the Saber. Furthermore, this Saber Intent is being unleashed unconsciously; this must be the indication of a better and deeper understanding of Saber Art as Qin Nan was practicing the Flying Saber Art.\u201d\\nWith this thought, Gong Yang could not help but feel a bit envious.Even though Gong Yang could be considered a super genius with his Martial Spirit\u2019s grade, it was impossible to improve his cultivation just by reading the cultivation notes from a book.Unless Gong Yang consumed a lot of time doing so, he would be able to refine his martial art.Until now, Gong Yang had clearly remembered, at the time he mastered the Greater Success Stage of One with the Weapons, his cultivation base had reached the eighth-layer Body-Tempering Realm long before; he was uncomparable to this Qin Nan before him.As Gong Yang was having random thoughts, he looked at the now fully-focused Qin Nan and a sudden thought came up to him, This Qin Nan, would he be able to reach the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber with this skill book?Shortly after, Gong Yang giggled and shook his head at this ridiculous thought.The difference between Greater Success Stage and Perfection Stage of One with the Saber was significant; it was not something that could be mastered in a day\u2019s time.In other words, the difference between Perfection Stage and Greater Success Stage was like the difference between a huge boulder and an ant.According to Gong Yang\u2019s prediction, even if it was Qin Nan\u2014even as a natural born Martial Addict\u2014it would take him at least a month of dedicated cultivation to master the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber.\u201cMaybe this Qin Nan is giving me too many shocks, causing me to believe he could complete such an incredible achievement\u2014this is fascinating.\u201d Gong Yang let out a grin and walked toward one of the shelves. He grabbed a book of cultivation notes and started cultivating.Time flowed quickly; two days had passed swiftly.\\nQin Nan remained at his original spot; the Saber Intent on him was getting more and more ferocious and much stronger\u2014but it was still a distance away from reaching the Perfection Stage.During this period, it was worth mentioning that the guardian of the third floor\u2014the old man in the black robe\u2014came checking on the situation once; after seeing Qin Nan and Gong Yang were both cultivating, he left immediately without saying anything.Following it, an announcement was made within the Mystic Spirit Sect.The third layer of the Skills Library would be closed for renovation\u2014not open to public for ten days\u2019 time.The news was not well received among the outer and inner disciples, as they expressed their dissatisfaction. However, they could only accept it since it was the decision made by the authority of the Skills Library.What they did not expect was that the reason the third layer of the Skills Library was closed for ten days was because the black robe old man did not want anyone to disturb Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation.Jokes aside\u2014how would I be able to face the consequences if the bearer of the Great Elder\u2019s Badge went berserk after his cultivation was disturbed?Qin Nan had no clue what was happening in the external world; he had reached a crucial moment of his cultivation.In these two days, Qin Nan had entered the Martial Addict stance; he had finished reading the whole skill book.The reason that Qin Nan was still cultivating was because of the Hundred Steps Soaring Saber of the Flying Saber Art\u2014together with the cultivation expression in the notes\u2014was way too complicated. Even Qin Nan had to digest it step-by-step, to grasp the basics of the Martial Skill.Do you really think the cultivation experience of a Martial Emperor can be understood and absorbed so easily?\\nHence, Qin Nan was now in a tough spot.As if there was a huge door blocking him; he was having a hard time breaking through the door to discover the secrets hiding behind it, despite trying his very best to open it.Only after a breakthrough would he then have a bit of understanding of the cultivation notes and the Hundred Steps Soaring Saber included in this Flying Saber Art.\u201cHundred Steps Soaring Saber refers to killing the enemy within a hundred steps. How is it possible to achieve such power? That\u2019s because, it is focusing the strength of the whole body to a pinpoint, allowing the flying saber to have a range of hundred steps\u2026 No no no, Hundred Steps Soaring Saber should not be this simple.\u201d\u201cHow about these cultivation experiences?\u201d\u201cThis genius keeps on mentioning being smooth with the Saber Art. It doesn\u2019t really make any sense\u2026 Hundred Steps Soaring Saber this terrifying skill focuses on imperiousness\u2026 It has nothing to do with smoothness.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I should be missing something, but what is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Nan\u2019s brain operated at its highest rate; but still, he could not find a way to breakthrough this huge door before him.At that instant, a blurry human figure could be seen floating behind Qin Nan; the figure slightly raised his head, as if he was looking straight through the galaxy\u2014an incredible aura was emitted.The Divine Battle Spirit had appeared automatically.The moment it appeared, there was a sudden flash intrusion in Qin Nan\u2019s mind.All the questions in Qin Nan\u2019s mind, all the mysteries, were gone instantly like dust blowing away; the mist of cloud had vanished, and the secrets concealed within it had all been revealed.A joyful expression appeared instantly on Qin Nan\u2019s face.\\n\u201cI get it! I get it now! Hundred Steps Soaring Saber is not about gathering all the strength of my body into a pinpoint; it\u2019s referring to the \u2018eye of a formation\u2019. This eye is just a saying; it\u2019s real form is my Saber Intent, which would be covering the area within a hundred steps if the eye is opened, killing the enemies at will within a hundred steps!\u201d\u201cHAHA, there\u2019s more! The cultivation notes left by the genius are not talking about smoothness; they are talking about the heart!\u201d\u201cThe saber can be smooth, twisting, ferocious, sharp; it can be anything. Hence, the Saber Intent must be released freely from the heart. Only if it\u2019s released freely, it would be my own Saber Intent\u2014which would then be the true stance of\u2026 One with the Saber!\u201dAt that instant, the previously closed eyes of Qin Nan burst open.Gong Yang\u2014who was initially cultivating with his eyes closed some distance away\u2014had his expression change and opened his eyes to look at Qin Nan after sensing something.After the glimpse, a shocked expression appeared on Gong Yang\u2019s face.The Saber Intent emitting from Qin Nan\u2019s body had the appearance of a flame; the breakthrough had caused it to grow incredibly. It felt like the Saber Intent was stronger and more powerful now.The most important part was that, within the Saber Intent, an untameable, firm, and impressive determination could be felt.The Saber Intent had reached the Perfection Stage.\u201cWhat\u2026what\u2026\u201d Gong Yang stared at him with his mouth open wide, not knowing what to say in this moment.It has been only a short period of four days; within this period, Qin Nan had reached the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber, with just a book of cultivation notes!Such terrifying speed; even the core disciples who Gong Yang had met before would not be able to achieve this.\\nDoes being a Martial Addict grant you such terrifying power?\u201cNo way.\u201d Gong Yang took a deep breath and thought, \u201cThis guy\u2019s Martial Talent must have surpassed a Martial Addict\u2019s\u2014and not by a little margin.\u201dAs he came to this conclusion, Gong Yang\u2019s gaze toward Qin Nan changed immediately, with a hint of this great importance.When he first saw the Great Elder\u2019s Badge, he was scared of the background Qin Nan possessed\u2014after he realized Qin Nan was a Martial Addict, he then had some respect for him.Now, Gong Yang viewed Qin Nan as a worthy opponent on par with himself.In other words, if Qin Nan were to become Gong Yang\u2019s opponent now, Gong Yang would not be looking down upon Qin Nan just because of his cultivation base of the fifth-layer Body-Tempering Realm; he would be incredibly cautious when facing him.However, Gong Yang would not know that, in the Mystic Spirit Sect, there was also a disciple who had already been fully subdued by Qin Nan after making contact with him.That disciple\u2019s name was Bai Heng.As the difference between Bai Heng and Gong Yang was huge, the final attitude of Bai Heng toward Qin Nan was like a slave seeing his master. Bai Heng was fully impressed as if Qin Nan had become his God, whom he did not dare to sin against or offend.\u201cSo this is the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber?\u201d Qin Nan opened his eyes, feeling the powerful Saber Intent within him and found himself immersed in joy.After that, he found Gong Yang standing not far away with a staggered expression and said, \u201cSenior Brother Gong, why are you still here? Hmm? What happened to you?\u201dQin Nan was confused, why is this Gong Yang staring at me blankly all of a sudden?\\nAfter hearing Qin Nan\u2019s question, Gong Yang collected his thoughts immediately and took a deep breath; he then let out a humble smile and said, \u201cI am a straightforward guy. Qin Nan, in these few days, you have definitely impressed me. From today onward, please don\u2019t call me Senior Brother formally. Since I\u2019m more experienced than you, how about you call me Brother Yang?\u201dQin Nan hesitated for a while before laughing out loud and saying, \u201cSure, from today onward, I\u2019ll rely on Brother Yang to take good care of me.\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So he decided to remain inside?\u201d Mo Li had an unpleasant look; he was not someone patient to begin with, but wasting his time by waiting for a few days straight had caused him to be hot-tempered.Lin Zixiao\u2019s expression was nothing better, but he remained silent.Meanwhile, two people could be seen walking out from the entrance of the Skills Library\u2014the one walking in front was none other than Qin Nan.Mo Li and Lin Zixiao found Qin Nan in almost the same instant.\\nA surge of joy sparked in Mo Li\u2019s heart, who immediately went forward and said in a mocking tone, \u201cQin Nan, you dare to come out finally? I\u2019ll give you a chance; but if you don\u2019t kneel down and bow your head at me a hundred times, I\u2019ll teach you a lesson!\u201dFollowing this, Mo Li unleashed a bursting aura toward Qin Nan with his cultivation of Martial Emperor Realm.Beside him, Lin Zixiao had an evil grin on his face.Now that I and Mo Li are together, what is the use of your great Martial Talent when your cultivation base is only the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm?Qin Nan was stunned.He did not expect to bump into Mo Li and Lin Zixiao directly upon coming out.As Qin Nan recovered from the shock, his face turned stone cold.Initially, it was not a big deal between him and Mo Li; who knew that Mo Li would purposely wait for him outside the Skills Library, and the first thing he would say was to force Qin Nan to kneel down and bow his head a hundred times.Who do you think you are; forcing me to kneel down and bow my head just because you are a Martial Emperor, and the disciple of the Third Elder?Unforgivable.As Qin Nan was about to refute, an icy voice appeared behind him; it was Gong Yang speaking, \u201cHow forceful, asking someone to kneel down straight away; do you really think you have the right to do so?\u201dThe words from Gong Yang were accompanied by an imperious aura; it was completely different than the calm appearance he had while interacting with Qin Nan.Mo Li and Lin Zixiao were staggered.They did not expect someone to back Qin Nan up at this moment.\\nImmediately, Mo Li and Lin Zixiao\u2019s expressions turned cold as they raised their heads looking toward the direction of the voice.Mo Li\u2019s expression changed instantly with a glance.Lin Zixiao\u2014who failed to sense the change\u2014let out a hollow laugh and said, \u201cWho do you think you are? I would be kind and give you a piece of advice; stay away from this matter. If not, you won\u2019t have the chance to regret later!\u201dAs soon as Lin Zixiao finished his sentence, Mo Li shouted suddenly, \u201cLin Zixiao, shut the f**k up; this is Senior Brother Gong Yang!\u201dAfter that, Mo Li walked up and forced a smile on his face saying, \u201cWhat a surprise, Senior Brother Gong Yang, you\u2019re here too. If he affronted you, I hope Senior Brother Gong Yang would forgive him\u2014please forgive him.\u201dGong Yang wore a calm expression, who glanced at Ling Zixiao and said, \u201cMo Li, there\u2019s no need for that. I\u2019m just a mere disciple; there\u2019s no reason to apologize to me.\u201dMo Li\u2019s face stiffened.Ling Zixiao\u2019s face changed instantly; a pale tone appeared on it.At this moment, even an idiot could tell that this Gong Yang had a formidable background\u2014if not, Mo Li would not have spoken in such a respectful tone.Despite that, this Ling Zixiao dared to scold this powerful disciple?Anyone would know that, in the Mystic Spirit Sect, there existed a lot of geniuses. Even if Ling Zixiao possessed a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, which made him a super genius, there were lots of people in this Mystic Spirit Sect whom he could not afford to offend.\u201cThis is Ling Zixiao. He\u2019s new to the Mystic Spirit Sect, so he still lacks manner; I do hope that Senior Brother Gong Yang won\u2019t make a fuss with him.\u201c Mo Li laughed hollowly and unnoticeably altered the topic as he said, \u201cOh right, Senior Brother Gong Yang, I hope you didn\u2019t misunderstand. The words I was saying were directed at this trash beside you; I wasn\u2019t talking about you.\u201d\\nWith these words, Mo Li was trying to hint at Gong Yang secretly, what happened just then had nothing to do with you, so please don\u2019t interfere.Upon hearing the words, Gong Yang let out a cold laugh and said, \u201cTrash, did you say? Qin Nan is my brother; who gave you the right to insult him? Mo Li, I\u2019m not wasting any more time with you; if you dare to say anything else, or continue to harass brother Qin Nan, then we shall meet in the Hall of Life and Death!\u201dA murderous intent was emitted, with a sense of imperiousness fully exposed from the words.Mo Li and Ling Zixiao\u2019s expressions turned dull immediately, as if they had just eaten something filthy.This Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation is only the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm, how did he become brothers with Gong Yang?This Qin Nan is supposed to be a new disciple with no one to rely on. It\u2019s fine if Xiao Qingxue is fond of him, but even Gong Yang is looking after him now?\u201cSorry, sorry. We\u2019ll leave now.\u201d Although Mo Li had a ruthless attitude, he would not dare to face Gong Yang in a duel in the Hall of Life and Death. As a result, he had no choice but to hold in his anger and give a forced smile, before leaving the place, grabbing Ling Zixiao along with him.If they continued to stay, both of them would most likely die from depression.They had waited for three or four days in a row just to insult Qin Nan. Now that Qin Nan had finally appeared, why did they become the embarrassed ones?After watching the two leaving, an icy expression flashed within Qin Nan\u2019s eyes, who put his fists together and said, \u201cThank you, Brother Yang, without you, they would not give up so easily.\u201d\\nGong Yang let out a smile and waved his hand as if it was nothing significant and said, \u201cQin Nan, stop being so polite. It\u2019s normal to help each other since we are friends. By the way, how did you and Mo Li become enemies?\u201dGong Yang wore a curious expression; logically speaking, Qin Nan is only a new disciple, and Mo Li is an inner disciple, how could they have a grudge against each other?Qin Nan instantly told Gong Yang what had happened before.After listening to it, Gong Yang looked at Qin Nan with a weird expression and said, \u201cHow come you are so close with Xiao Qingxue?\u201dQin Nan did not withhold the truth, who answered straight away, \u201cQingxue gave me a helping hand on multiple occasions throughout the journey here; it was all pure kindness.\u201dGong Yang nodded his head without saying anything; a hint of hesitation was seen in his eyes.Should I inform Qin Nan about Xiao Qingxue?Immediately after, as Gong Yang remembered Qin Nan possessed a Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge, he burst out laughing and shook his head to get rid of his thought.In the meantime, a pleasant voice was heard, \u201cQin Nan, you\u2019re done with your cultivation? Oh? Isn\u2019t this Senior Brother Gong Yang?\u201dXiao Qingxue approached from a distance; this time she was wearing a blue robe, the edges of the dress looked like a mist, which caused her to appear like a fairy. However, a confused expression was seen on her beautiful face.It seems like Qin Nan and Gong Yang were having a friendly conversation, as if they are quite close to each other?Since when did Qin Nan and Senior Brother Gong Yang get this close with each other?\u201cOh? It\u2019s Junior Sister Qingxue. I bumped into Qin Nan in the Skills Library, and we soon become friends with each other due to our matching personalities. Now that you\u2019re here\u2014plus the fact that I have something to attend to\u2014allow me to excuse myself.\u201d Gong Yang brought his fists together and left instantly without wasting any more time.\\nThis caused Qin Nan to be slightly surprised, why did Gong Yang leave immediately after seeing Xiao Qingxue?Xiao Qingxue was not bothered at all, who looked at Qin Nan with a pair of flickering eyes and said, \u201cQin Nan, you\u2019re so lucky. You still don\u2019t know Senior Brother Gong Yang\u2019s identity yet, right? He is ranked top ten among the inner disciples; his Martial Spirit has reached the tenth-grade Huang rank. It\u2019s incredibly powerful.\u201dQin Nan was stunned; even though he knew Gong Yang was strong, he did not expect this Gong Yang to be this powerful.No wonder Gong Yang had no respect for Mo Li just then; the difference between the two was huge.\u201cOk, let\u2019s put that aside.\u201d Xiao Qingxue said in a serious tone, \u201cOnly five days are left until the Trial of Versatility. Come, follow me; you need to start practicing immediately. You must at least try your best to raise your cultivation to the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm within these five days.\u201dAfter hearing this, Qin Nan\u2019s face turned serious too; he nodded his head and followed Xiao Qingxue without wasting time.My priority now is to improve my cultivation!If not, in the upcoming Trial of Versatility, even if I have my Divine Battle Spirit, and a Perfection Stage of One with the Saber, I would still be mismatched against those super geniuses with a cultivation base of eighth-layer or tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm.\u2026\u2026\u2026Mystic Spirit Sect, inside an abode of one of the inner disciples\u2026\u2026\u2026Mo Li and Ling Zixiao were seated together, with dull expressions on their faces.In the past hour, they had barely said anything, which indicated how gloomy they were after what had happened previously.\u201cSenior Brother, I don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d Ling Zixiao had finally spoken up, with his eyes burning red, emitting a murderous aura, \u201cAs soon as the Trial of Versatility has begun, I will attack Qin Nan, suck his blood dry, and slash his bones; I want him to beg for his death; if not, my anger will not be relinquished!\u201d\\n\u201cHmph!\u201d Mo Li\u2019s expression was twisted, as he said, \u201cIdiot! I have a plan instead. Let\u2019s collaborate with all the geniuses among the new disciples. We\u2019ll all attack Qin Nan when the Trial of Versatility starts, granting him a guaranteed death!\u201dLing Zixiao was shocked, and then refuted, \u201cWorking with other geniuses? Qin Nan is just a piece of trash, I can handle him by myself!\u201dMo Li stared coldly at him and said, \u201cAll the disciples will be spread randomly at the start of the Trial of Versatility. Are you sure that you are able to find him? This is why we must work with other geniuses; as long as Qin Nan bumps into anyone of them, with his trashy cultivation base, he would die for sure.\u201cBesides that, you must keep this in mind; even if your cultivation is stronger than Qin Nan\u2019s, you must be cautious and plan ahead\u2014it\u2019s no good if Qin Nan is able to escape in the end!\u201dLing Zixiao inhaled sharply and said, \u201cBut, why would those geniuses be willing to help us?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so brainless.\u201d Mo Li shook his head and said in a cold tone, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you\u2019re a super genius with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. Why would these new disciples offend you just merely because of Qin Nan? They do not dare to offend you; instead, they would be sucking up to you. This is only the first the reason. Secondly, the Third Elder is my father. Thirdly, if we provide sufficient benefits, together with the first and second reasons; I won\u2019t need to say the rest\u2026\u201dAfter saying this, Mo Li wore a cruel expression, \u201cBut I dare to say, if there are three hundred participants in this Trial of Versatility, there will be at least two hundred and seventy people who would accept our offer and deal with Qin Nan; that trash would have nowhere to hide\u2014his death is guaranteed!\u201d\\nAfter hearing the words, Ling Zixiao was staggered, but wore an excited expression.Qin Nan, with this magnificent plot, what hope do you\u2014a piece of trash\u2014have to survive it?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Eyes of the Divine Battle SpiritPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49 \u2013 Eyes of the Divine Battle SpiritUnder Xiao Qingxue\u2019s lead, Qin Nan arrived at a residential area.The whole area had a circumference of around three miles; there were two hundred plus rooms and every room had a unique number.Besides this, there were also four Martial Emperor experts guarding the entrance to the area.Xiao Qingxue said, \u201cThis area was built specifically for new disciples like you. Qin Nan, you are number nineteen\u2014you can enter straight away and start cultivating.\u201dAfter hesitating momentarily, Xiao Qingxue smilingly said, \u201cOf course, every room here is protected by concealing formations set up by experts. The aura from your Martial Spirit\u2014or whatever you do when you\u2019re cultivating\u2014will not leak out.\u201dQin Nan nodded his head, if these rooms did not have these concealing formations, he would not dare to cultivate here.\u201cGo on. I\u2019ll pick you up in ten days.\u201d Xiao Qingxue said.\u201cAlright.\u201dQin Nan did not waste any time; he immediately walked up to check-in with his name, then proceeded straight to room number nineteen.The room only had an area of thirty meters squared, with a futon placed in the middle; there was dry food placed at the side of the room, specially prepared for new disciples who were planning to cultivate in seclusion.Qin Nan went up to the futon and sat on it with his legs crossed. The Divine Martial Spirit appeared, floating behind him.\u201cI received fifty Xiantian Pills from the bet with Bai Heng previously. Now is the best time to consume the pills, and see what level my Divine Battle Spirit will be upgraded to.\u201dQin Nan thought in his mind, and took out one Xiantian Pill and placed it in his mouth.After consuming the Xiantian Pill, Qin Nan was slightly nervous.\\nAlthough Body Tempering Pills could increase the grade of the Divine Battle Spirit, Qin Nan was still unsure whether these Xiantian Pills\u2014which were a higher-grade than the Body-Tempering Pills\u2014were able to increase his Martial Spirit\u2019s grade.As the Xiantian Pill was consumed, the Divine Battle Spirit emitted an arcane absorbing force, which sucked in the Qi contained in the Xiantian Pill and swallowed it.After seeing this, Qin Nan was slightly relieved; he continued to take the Xiantian Pills out and consume them one-by-one.\u201cI\u2019m not sure how many Xiantian Pills I need to level up this time\u2026\u201dQin Nan said to himself.In just a brief moment, he had consumed ten Xiantian Pills, but the Divine Battle Spirit still had no sign of levelling up.\u201cTaking the pills one-by-one is really too slow\u2014let\u2019s eat ten pills at once!\u201dAfter making the decision, Qin Nan grabbed a handful of Xiantian Pills and shoved them into his mouth.He repeated the same action three times, but the Divine Battle Spirit still remained silent.Even Qin Nan started to have cold sweats on his forehead after seeing this.Forty Xiantian Pills and the Divine Battle Spirit did not budge?\u201cOne Xiantian Pill is equivalent to at least one hundred Body-Tempering Pills. Forty of these should be equal to four thousand Body-Tempering Pills. If I take ten more, it would be five thousand. How come the Divine Battle Spirit has not levelled up with all these pills?\u201dQin Nan did not look happy and clenched his teeth, grabbing the remaining ten Xiantian Pills, shoved them all into his mouth.Following this, time turned slower.One breath\u2019s time\u2026 Two breath\u2019s time\u2026 A hundred breath\u2019s time\u2026 Even when the time it took for an incense to burn had passed, the Divine Battle Spirit remained silent.\\nA wry smile appeared on his face as he said, \u201cLooks like the amount of pills needed for the Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s next level dramatically increases after each level up. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m not sure how many pills I would need for the ninth-grade Huang rank, or even Xuan ranked.\u201dQin Nan let out a quiet sigh, but he was only disappointed for a brief while.It was overwhelming that the Divine Battle Spirit could be upgraded in the first place; thus, it was acceptable to spend quite an amount of pills to do so.\u201cFor now, I guess I should focus on improving my cultivation.\u201dQin Nan soon calmed himself down, and released his Divine Battle Spirit; the Qi in the surroundings was soon absorbed by it.However, a rare sight took place in this moment.On the blurry figure of the Divine Battle Spirit\u2014close to the pair of void-looking eyes\u2014it felt like there was a pen drawing slowly, causing the outline of the eyes to become clearer.Even though the eyes had no pupils, there was an ancient, chaotic, age-old, and mysterious feeling to them.Meanwhile, in Qin Nan\u2019s mind, a familiar ancient voice could be heard, \u201cEyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, discerning the heaven and earth; there\u2019s nothing it can\u2019t detect, there\u2019s nothing it can\u2019t inspect\u2026\u201dA flabbergasted expression could be seen on Qin Nan\u2019s face; what was going on?Before Qin Nan had the chance to figure it out, the ancient voice caused an exploding pain in his mind, knocking him unconscious.In the meantime, something Qin Nan was unaware of was happening; an ancient, mysterious force was emitted from the eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, which flowed into Qin Nan\u2019s eyes slowly, causing his eyes to emit an ominous blue light.\\n\u2026\u2026After two days passed, Qin Nan had finally awoke after fainting.\u201cAw\u2026 same as last time, it feels like my brain is going to explode.\u201d Qin Nan took a deep breath.After the time it took for an incense to burn, Qin Nan had finally gotten used to the pain, and immediately decided to unleash his Divine Battle Spirit.He was eager to know; why did the ancient voice appear so suddenly? What are the eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit?Despite that, before Qin Nan unleashed his Divine Battle Spirit, he found something shocking.His vision was able to penetrate the walls and see what was outside; he could clearly see everything within the three miles of the residential area.It was as if he had flown up into the sky, and was looking down at the whole area. Qin Nan could also slightly detect a round formation in a spinning motion right underneath the residential area.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s shocked expression had no sign of disappearing; how did my vision become so powerful in just a night\u2019s time?Even Martial Emperor experts wouldn\u2019t be able to do what I\u2019m doing, to be able to see the whole area within three miles with just a glimpse.\u201cIs it because of the voice yesterday? The eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit?\u201d Qin Nan found an answer in his mind, but he was not quite sure about it\u2014he immediately calmed himself down and unleashed the Divine Battle Spirit.As soon as the Divine Battle Spirit appeared, Qin Nan instantly saw the clear outline of the eyes, causing his heart to skip a beat.\u201cLooks like the Divine Battle Spirit is the answer!\u201dQin Nan took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down, but the shock in his eyes felt like an unstoppable flood, and continued to grow.\\nIt was because from his observation, Qin Nan had discovered an astonishing secret!Since Qin Nan had awoken this Divine Battle Spirit, it had always been a blurry human figure, with no clear outline of the body parts.Previously, Qin Nan\u2019s vision had improved once, which happened after he took a huge amount of pills. Since then, his eyes had a special power\u2014he was able to detect people\u2019s cultivation base, and his range of sight had greatly improved.Now, after Qin Nan had consumed fifty Xiantian Pills two days ago, the outline of the Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s eye sockets had appeared.Does this mean that after consuming the pills, those unseen parts including the pupils, the nose, the ears, the lips, the neck, the chest, etc. would appear one by one? Is a real giant going to appear in the end?Besides that, it was even more shocking that as the body parts of the Divine Battle Spirit appeared, Qin Nan would obtain equivalent abilities.As an example, after the appearance of the eye sockets this time, he had obtained the eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit!If the Martial Spirit had its nose, its mouth, its ears, its palms, etc. in the future, did that mean Qin Nan would obtain their powers too?Something like the nose of the Divine Battle Spirit, or the ears of the Divine Battle Spirit.\u201cEven though the nose of the Divine Battle Spirit and the ears of the Divine Battle Spirit sound a bit weird, I have learned that I would need lots of pills! With the pills, not only would the grade of the Divine Battle Spirit be increased, its body parts will also appear one-by-one, granting me their abilities!\u201d\u201cIf the Divine Battle Spirit were to turn into a complete human, whose Martial Spirit would be comparable to mine?\u201d\\nAfter recovering from the shock, Qin Nan\u2019s eyes burned with flames.Although what he just said was quite cocky, for some reason, Qin Nan had this feeling: when this blurry figure of the Divine Battle Spirit transformed into a real human\u2026 the power of his Divine Battle Spirit would be unstoppable throughout Heaven and Earth!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - Xiao LengPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50 \u2013 Xiao LengQin Nan soon calmed himself down.It would take a crazy, unimaginable amount of pills to transform the current phantom-like figure of the Divine Battle Spirit into a real human.On the other hand, Qin Nan now was poor as hell, and could not find a single pill on himself.\u201cF**k it, the priority now is to focus on cultivation.\u201dQin Nan whispered something to himself; the Divine Battle Spirit behind him immediately unleashed an absorbing force, gathering the Qi from his surroundings.After a stream of Qi entered his body, it turned into continuous rolling waves that covered his whole body, leading to a strengthening effect.\u201cAs I broke through to the fifth layer Body Tempering Realm last time, I strengthened my inner body parts, but it wasn\u2019t enough; I\u2019ll need to continue strengthening them.\u201dQin Nan clearly knew what to do, and controlled the abundant Qi to flow gradually toward the body parts.For the time being, Qin Nan immersed himself in cultivating.On the third day\u2019s morning, Qin Nan\u2019s whole body was giving out \u2018Pi\u2013 li\u2013 pa\u2013 la\u2013\u2019 cracking sound, like beans being stir-fried.In these three days, Qin Nan\u2019s inner body parts had evolved to the next stage; his cultivation had now reached the peak of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm, only a small step away from the sixth-layer.Despite that, it was impossible to take this step in a short period of time.The reason was that Qin Nan had spent most of his time on practicing Martial Skills after reaching the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm; he did not spend much time cultivating.If he wanted to improve to the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm, it would take at least ten days to do so, even with Qin Nan\u2019s eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.\\n\u201cPhew.\u201dQin Nan opened his eyes slowly and released a prolonged exhalation. He then rose and went out from the room.Today was the last day before the start of the Trial of Versatility.Prior to the trial, Qin Nan had promised Xiao Qingxue that he would come out of seclusion earlier to meet up with her.As expected, when Qin Nan came out from the residential area, a gorgeous lady wearing blue clothes could be seen from afar.However, something was different compared to previous occasions\u2014there was a young man standing beside Xiao Qingxue.The guy was wearing a black outfit; a frosty aura could be felt from him.Qin Nan did a quick scan with his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit and immediately saw the guy\u2019s cultivation to be of the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm.\u201cQin Nan.\u201d Xiao Qingxue let out a soft exclamation when she saw Qin Nan. Following this, a surprised expression appeared in her beautiful eyes.Even though Qin Nan still hadn\u2019t achieved the sixth-layer of the Body Tempering Realm\u2014which was what she had expected\u2014there was something different about Qin Nan\u2019s aura that she could not explain.It was as if Qin Nan was encapsulated in a noble aura.Xiao Qingxue did not hesitate for too long, as she quickly said, \u201cThe Trial of Versatility is starting soon. Here, take this. It\u2019s called an Escape Orb. Once you break it, you will be teleported a mile away.\u201dXiao Qingxue gently waved her hand, and on top of her pale, elegant palm was a floating orb.This orb was thoroughly black, perfectly round in shape, and emitted an arcane force.\u201cEscape Orb?\u201d Qin Nan glanced suspiciously at the orb, but he did not hesitate for too long before shaking his head and saying, \u201cQingxue, the help you\u2019ve given me is sufficient. This Escape Orb is too precious, I couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s my gift, you must take it.\u201d It seemed like Xiao Qingxue had expected Qin Nan to reject her, as she straightened her face and said, \u201cUnless I\u2019m not a friend to you.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201dQin Nan let out a wry smile; although his expression did not budge while facing Ling Zixiao and Mo Li\u2014these two great enemies\u2014he was clueless how to deal with Xiao Qingxue\u2019s ruthlessness.After letting out a sigh, Qin Nan accepted the Escape Orb, and said in a serious tone, \u201cQingxue, don\u2019t worry. I will remember your kindness with all my heart.\u201dQin Nan said these words sincerely.Xiao Qingxue had always been helping him at crucial moments\u2014at Lingshui City, or the Escape Orb this time.This friendship should be taken care of preciously.\u201cThere you go.\u201d Xiao Qingxue\u2019s face turned joyful, as she giggled and said, \u201cBy the way, let me introduce you to someone. This is my brother, Xiao Leng; he\u2019s also a new disciple. During the Trial of Versatility, you two can befriend and help each other.\u201dQin Nan had understood Xiao Qingxue\u2019s intentions; he brought his fists together toward Xiao Leng and said, \u201cI\u2019m Qin Nan. Nice to meet you. I hope Brother Xiao would keep an eye on me.\u201dXiao Leng glanced at Qin Nan coldly; he appeared to be not too fond of Qin Nan, and said in an icy tone, with a hint of disdain, \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. Who among the new disciples haven\u2019t heard of the famous Qin Nan? I have no idea where you got the courage from to go and offend Ling Zixiao.\u201dQin Nan was slightly stunned.Xiao Qingxue\u2019s expression changed instantly as she snapped, \u201cXiao Leng, mind your attitude. Apologize to Qin Nan now!\u201d\u201cApologize? I won\u2019t apologize. I\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u201d Xiao Leng smirked coldly and said, \u201cQin Nan, your cultivation base is merely of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm. Your Martial Spirit is only eighth-grade Huang ranked. Apart from having a greater Martial Talent than Ling Zixiao, how are you comparable to Ling Zixiao in other areas?\u201d\\nQin Nan collected his thoughts and smiled gently as he said, \u201cI\u2019m indeed not worthy enough to be compared with Ling Zixiao.\u201d\u201cLooks like you still have some sense of self-awareness.\u201d Xiao Leng took a glimpse at Qin Nan and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a talent my sister discovered. Let me give you a piece of advice: the Trial of Versatility is not about Martial Talent, but rather will be testing your capabilities. With your current fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm and eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, your death is inevitable if you bump into Ling Zixiao. Therefore, it\u2019s better if you lower your head and apologize to Ling Zixiao before the trial starts. Those who act in anticipation of the future are wise.\u201dXiao Leng then said, \u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say.\u201dAfter finishing this sentence, Xiao Leng did not give Xiao Qingxue a chance to speak; with a flash, his figure disappeared in the two\u2019s vision.Upon seeing this, Xiao Qingxue did not have a pleasant expression; in a low voice she said, \u201cQin Nan, don\u2019t be bothered on account of my brother. He has been conceited since he was young, so there\u2019s some flaws in his personality\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dQin Nan let out a gentle smile; even though Xiao Leng\u2019s words made Qin Nan uncomfortable, he would not have a grudge against him.It was because Xiao Leng was Xiao Qingxue\u2019s brother; it was a way for Qin Nan to show his respect toward Xiao Qingxue.After making sure Qin Nan was not angry, Xiao Qingxue let out a relieved sigh, and continued to advise, \u201cQin Nan, please be careful in the Trial of Versatility, and avoid acting on impulse. To be harsh, although your Martial Talent is outstanding among the disciples, it has only been a month since you started cultivating, thus your cultivation base is still too weak compared to theirs. Therefore, try to be more forbearing\u2026\u201d\\nAs she said that, Xiao Qingxue realized Qin Nan was looking at her with a weird expression; she hesitated for a while, and her face turned red.What is happening to me today? Why am I worrying so much, and speaking so much nonsense?Why am I so worried for Qin Nan\u2019s safety?\u201cQin Nan is the genius I discovered\u2014I am just admiring him, and hoping that he won\u2019t die in the Trial of Versatility.\u201d Xiao Qingxue tried to explain this to herself in her mind, but as she saw that Qin Nan was still staring at her with a weird expression, as if he knew exactly what she was thinking. This made her panic a little, and she immediately straightened her face, showing her prestige as a senior sister, \u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, do you understand?\u201d\u201cRoger that, Senior Sister.\u201d Qin Nan said with a serious face.After seeing Qin Nan\u2019s reaction, Xiao Qingxue could not help but laugh; she then said in a serious tone, \u201cQin Nan, I hope that you get a good ranking in this Trial of Versatility.\u201dQin Nan went silent for a while, before he smiled and nodded his head. He then turned around and walked away.Even though he did not say anything, he had made a promise in his heart.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - Tremendous RewardsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51 \u2013 Tremendous RewardsWhen Qin Nan arrived at the White Jade Dojo, the whole place was crowded with people; with just a glimpse, Qin Nan estimated that there were around three hundred plus new disciples, which was a few hundred more than last time.\u201cIt seems like the number of newly recruited disciples has exceeded my expectations.\u201dQin Nan exclaimed in his heart, before he then subtly blended into the crowd.Even though he had made a name for himself, most of the disciples still would not know who he was\u2014they would not bother to notice him.Even Qin Nan\u2019s enemy, Ling Zixiao, had no time to spend on Qin Nan at this moment.\u201cThe new disciples here were all the newly recruited ones of the Mystic Spirit Sect this year, which is a few hundred more than last time. Let me observe them with my Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, to see just how many people are worthy of my attention.\u201dQin Nan, unnoticed to anyone else, scanned the whole White Jade Dojo with his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.Every single new disciple at the scene would never have expected someone to inspect them one-by-one just as the Trial of Versatility was about to commence.The observation took the time equivalent to the time needed for two incenses to burn.The final result caused a grave expression to appear on Qin Nan\u2019s face.The last time he had observed, there were around forty people worthy of his attention. This time, there were around eighty or more people in total whom he needed to take note of.Every single one of these eighty or more disciples had a cultivation base of at least the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm\u2014two layers higher than Qin Nan\u2019s.Besides that, Qin Nan had also realized that quite a large amount of disciples had improved themselves in the past ten days.\\nFor example, Ling Zixiao\u2014Qin Nan\u2019s enemy\u2014had improved his cultivation to the ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm.\u201cLooks like this Trial of Versatility is going to be an intense battle between geniuses.\u201dQin Nan withdrew his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit after having this thought; a thrilling sensation gradually arose in his heart.Meanwhile, all of a sudden, five forceful auras approached from afar in the sky.The initially noisy White Jade Dojo fell into silence at this instant.All the new disciples at the scene had their expressions change after detecting the pressure, and as if they were being pressed downward by five large mountains, it caused them to have trouble breathing.In the sky, five old men could be seen walking toward them with forceful auras; they were the five elders of the Mystic Spirit Sect.Among the five elders, the one leading them was the old white-haired man who came to the White Jade Dojo last time.After the old white-haired man settled down, he scanned the whole area with his gaze like last time, which ended up on Huang Long and Ling Zixiao as he complimented, \u201cTwo ninth-grade Huang ranked geniuses indeed. Huang Long and Ling Zixiao, you two have done great. In the following Trial of Versatility, us five have high hopes in the performances of you two.\u201dThe other four elders nodded their heads smilingly, without concealing the hint of admiration in their eyes.Huang Long smiled showing his teeth, whereas Ling Zixiao raised his head; the prideful expression on his face was further ingrained.All the other new disciples in the surroundings were glancing at them with admiration.Same as before, the old white-haired man acted resolutely, who quickly calmed his expression down and said, \u201cThe Trial of Versatility will be under the supervision of us five. I\u2019ll be the MC for the time being. I\u2019ll now explain the rules of the Trial of Versatility. I\u2019ll only say this once, so listen carefully.\u201d\\nThe words from the old white-haired man were accompanied by a hint of imperiousness, which encapsulated the whole dojo.All the new disciples had their focus fixed on the old man, not willing to miss out on a single detail.An undetectable prideful expression flashed across the old white-haired man\u2019s eyes, as he said in an icy tone, \u201cThe Trial of Versatility will take place on the Island of Versatility. In a while, we five elders will work together to create a teleport portal, and send you all onto the island. Your starting positions are randomized. In a month\u2019s time, the formation on the island will be activated, sending you all back here.\u201d\u201cAs for the rules: Firstly, killing is not prohibited in the duration of the Trial of Versatility.\u201d\u201cSecondly, there are thirty Blue Dragon Badges on the Island of Versatility; the rankings are determined by the number of Blue Dragon Badges one has.\u201d\u201cThirdly, only the top ten will be rewarded in this trial.\u201dAs the old white-haired man finished talking, all the new disciples fell silent for a brief while, before their eyes started to flicker with concealed murderous intent.There were no idiots among these people.With these three rules combined together, this Trial of Versatility would turn into a deadly brawl between the disciples.It was highly possible that those who referred to each other as friends would turn into enemies straight away.Qin Nan had also understood this after hearing the three rules.The sense of excitement in his heart had grown stronger at that instant.The old white-haired man scanned the disciples with his gaze again, before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll now talk about the rewards. First rank will get a Nine Rotation Golden Pill. Second rank will get a Third Rotation Golden Pill. Third rank will get ten thousand Xiantian Pills, and a chance to pick a treasure from the Treasure Vault. Fourth to tenth rank will get nine thousand, eight thousand, seven thousand, six thousand, five thousand, four thousand, and three thousand Xiantian Pills respectively.\u201d\\nAfter the words, the whole White Jade Dojo fell into a dead silence.Every single new disciple\u2019s face turned red instantly, while breathing heavily; to an extent that their hearts were beating three times faster than the normal rate.These new disciples came from different places within the Luo River Kingdom; some of them were born in Martial Clans, giving them formidable backgrounds.Despite that, these disciples were utterly stunned at this moment.These rewards given by the Mystic Spirit Sect were absolutely tremendous.Even though they were unsure what the Nine Rotation Golden Pill and the Three Rotation Golden Pill were, they did know that if these were the rewards for the first and second rank, their values were most likely going to be overwhelming.In that instant, the gazes of the new disciples changed once again.While looking at their surroundings, their gazes were filled with vigilance and murderous intent, as if all the others were opponents\u2014enemies of life and death.Due to the great benefits before them, a craving and a sense of urgency rose up in their hearts.Meanwhile, Qin Nan was still immersed in the shock. As he finally recovered, his eyes burned with flames of desire.What did Qin Nan need the most? Pills, without a doubt.Even the tenth rank of the Trial of Versatility would receive two thousand Xiantian Pills.If these two thousand Xiantian Pills were traded for Body Tempering Pills, it would be twenty thousand Body Tempering Pills.If he were to have those twenty thousand Body Tempering Pills, how much would his Divine Battle Spirit improve? Maybe it could reach the tenth-grade Huang rank? Or even reach the Xuan rank which was mentioned in legends?The crucial thing was that this was only the reward for the tenth rank.\\nIf Qin Nan were to achieve the third rank, the reward would be ten thousand Xiantian Pills, which was equivalent to a hundred thousand Body Tempering Pills!\u201cWhat a surprise, I had never expected the Mystic Spirit Sect to offer such tremendous rewards. This is great news; I have to get into at least the top three in this Trial of Versatility! If I\u2019m able to do so, then I would be soar into the sky in this Mystic Spirit Sect!\u201dThe excitement in Qin Nan\u2019s heart had been fully exposed, causing him to feel lively immediately; he clenched his fists tightly, with a firm determination in his eyes.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The five of us will now activate the transportation portal.\u201dAs soon as this sentence ended, people didn\u2019t even have time to react before the five elders stomped their feet on the ground, unleashing a rich and mystical force like a flash flood, which flowed into the White Jade Dojo.At that instant, a terrifying occurrence took place.A blinding golden light could be seen rising up from beneath the White Jade Dojo, like a huge dragon; it began to twist around and transform into a large formation emitting golden light, which covered the whole area.The transportation portal finished warping in at that instant.At this time, the five elders\u2019 breathing was slightly heavier, indicating the huge amount of strength needed to warp in such a large formation.The old white-haired man took a deep breath, and said in his usual cold tone, \u201cThe transportation portal is established. However, the full operation of the portal requires more time\u2014the time half an incense would need to burn. Within this period, you are not permitted to go anywhere.\u201dAfter hearing these words, everyone nodded their heads respectfully.Even Qin Nan was utterly impressed when he first saw the large formation; this was his first time seeing such an enigmatic formation.\\n\u201cSince there\u2019s still some time left, I should meditate and mentally prepare myself for the upcoming intense battle on the Island of Versatility.\u201d Qin Nan muttered thoughtfully to himself, before sitting down with his legs crossed.Unexpectedly, a rare sight happened at that moment.A mysteriously powerful killing intent sprang up in the White Jade Dojo, locking blatantly onto Qin Nan.The sudden phenomenon attracted everyone\u2019s attention\u2014all gazes were directed toward the source of the murderous intent.Even the five elders\u2014who were taking care of the formation in the air\u2014were a little surprised, before looking for the source of the intent.Qin Nan\u2019s face twisted; he also immediately searched for the source of the murderous intent directed at him.The one emitting such a murderous intent was none other than Ling Zixiao.Ling Zixiao ignored everyone\u2019s gazes, including those from the five elders, and as if Qin Nan was the only one in his sights, he said, \u201cQin Nan, you\u2019re not so smug now, huh? I\u2019ll let you beg for a quick death once we arrive at the Island of Versatility.\u201dThe words were filled with a bone-chilling murderous intent.Upon hearing his words, all the disciples collected their thoughts, and understanding expressions appeared on their faces.The conflict between Qin Nan and Ling Zixiao had already been a hot topic among the disciples.The only ones confused were the five elders in the air.They all knew who Ling Zixiao was\u2014he was one of the highly anticipated super-geniuses in this Trial of Versatility.Who on earth is this one named Qin Nan? With cultivation base of merely the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm, how did he make Ling Zixiao so angry?Standing under the spotlight, Qin Nan\u2019s expression remained unchanged after being threatened by Ling Zixiao; he calmly said, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\\nAfter saying these words, Qin Nan did not bother speaking anymore; he turned his head around, as if Ling Zixiao was unworthy of his attention.Ling Zixiao\u2019s face contorted immediately; he had never expected Qin Nan to be so supercilious and ignore him prior to entering the Island of Versatility.Did Qin Nan still think that anyone would help him on the Island of Versatility?A menacing smile appeared on Ling Zixiao\u2019s face, as he said in a loud voice, \u201cEveryone, since Qin Nan is my enemy, if any of you kill him on the Island of Versatility, the reward I mentioned to you all before is still valid. Therefore, I do hope everyone here would do me a favor, and kill this trashy Qin Nan!\u201dAfter hearing these words, an unpleasant feeling rose up in Qin Nan\u2019s heart just as he was about to sit down and meditate.The five elders in the air were flabbergasted once again, even more so than before.However, the next thing that happened was not only an answer to Qin Nan\u2019s prediction, but it also solved the doubts the fiver elders were having.Two hundred and twenty out of the three hundred new disciples emitted horrendous murderous auras toward Qin Nan, as if they were facing their greatest enemy.On account of this, the entire White Jade Dojo was covered in a murderous aura\u2014it became icy, as if winter had arrived.The silent White Jade Dojo also exploded at this moment.\u201cHAHAHA, since this trashy Qin Nan has offended Brother Ling Zixiao, if I stumble into him on the Island of Versatility, I\u2019ll beat the crap out of him and bring him to you.\u201d\u201cTsk, tsk, Brother Ling Zixiao, how could I reject such a good offer to kill such a piece of trash?\u201d\\n\u201cHumph, he dares to even offend Brother Ling Zixiao with a mere cultivation base of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm\u2014this is totally unacceptable, he must die.\u201d\u201cHAHA, it\u2019s my pleasure to kill someone for Brother Ling Zixiao.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter seeing this, the remaining new disciples were shocked\u2014even the five elders in the air were surprised too.They had not expected Ling Zixiao to gather two hundred and twenty disciples just to deal with Qin Nan.Why was such a large gang necessary to deal with trash whose cultivation base was merely the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm?Qin Nan\u2019s face was pursed.Qin Nan\u2019s face had never twitched when facing the pressure from a Martial Emperor, but it was completely different this time.How overwhelming was it when two hundred and twenty disciples emitted a murderous aura at the same time?It felt like two hundred and twenty broadswords stained with blood were hanging above Qin Nan\u2019s head, ready to be dropped onto him at any time, leaving him with nowhere to run, and nowhere to escape to.At that instant, Qin Nan\u2019s whole body turned stiff, as if he was facing the greatest danger in his life; it felt like the blood in his body had been frozen, obstructing the blood flow.Upon seeing this, Ling Zixiao burst out laughing, \u201cHAHAHAHA, Qin Nan, have you ever thought of this happening? These are the consequences when someone offends me. Even though I might not see you later\u2014as everyone\u2019s spawning location is randomized after entering the Island of Versatility\u2014death is the only result for you!\u201dAfter saying this, Ling Zixiao\u2019s face turned menacing.Meanwhile, those two hundred and twenty disciples who had exploded their murderous aura at Qin Nan were now looking at him with disdain and scornful expressions, as if they were looking at a dead body.\\nIn their opinion, Qin Nan\u2019s death was guaranteed upon entering the Island of Versatility.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why are you joining forces with all these disciples to eliminate this ant?\u201dSeeing how the whole incident took place, it was reasonable for the old white-haired man to voice his doubts.However, from these words, all the new disciples at the scene instantly realized that the five elders were never concerned of Qin Nan\u2019s well being\u2014they would not help Qin Nan under any circumstances.The five elders were only interested in the cause of the incident.As if Ling Zixiao was performing a magic trick, the menacing expression on his face turned respectful, as he said, \u201cElder, this Qin Nan had a battle of Martial Skill talent with me at the Skills Library. He set me up with his Martial Skill talent, which caused me to be prohibited to enter the Skills Library for the rest of my life.\u201dAfter the spoken words, a hint of anger could be seen in the eyes of the old white-haired man and the other four elders.\\nIt was evident that their anger was directed at Qin Nan.The old white-haired man\u2019s tone turned ice cold straight away, and he said, \u201cThis Qin Nan dares to do such a thing to the sect\u2019s super-genius when he\u2019s just fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm trash. All disciples, hear my decree, you are allowed to join forces and kill Qin Nan at will after entering the Island of Versatility.\u201dThe other four elders nodded their heads, while staring mercilessly at Qin Nan.In the five elders\u2019 opinions, Huang Long and Ling Zixiao were both highly anticipated super-geniuses. However, the five elders had never expected that this weak Qin Nan\u2014with just an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014dared to set Ling Zixiao up, causing him to be prohibited from entering the Skills Library for the rest of his life.For a super-genius, it was extremely cruel to be prohibited from entering the Skills Library.Therefore, it was evident how furious these five elders were.If they were not busy with setting up the portal of transportation, the five elders would attack Qin Nan without hesitation.Even though the sect rules did not allow Qin Nan to be killed, they could still beat the shit out of him.Ling Zixiao was not surprised by their words. From his assumption, the five elders would lean toward his side. In the Martial World, including the Mystic Spirit Sect, only the real super-geniuses would be treated with great care.In that instant, the gazes from those two hundred and twenty disciples were even more scornful.Even the elders have decided to kill you, what\u2019s the point for you, Qin Nan, to stay alive?At this moment, within the large golden formation at the White Jade Dojo, the two hundred and twenty disciples and Ling Zixiao emitted murderous auras like countless rolling waves aimed at Qin Nan.\\nIn addition, the five elders floating in the air felt like five huge mountains, pushing down on Qin Nan with terrifying murderous intent.Under such pressure from these two sources of murderous aura, Qin Nan appeared to be tiny, like an ant, one which would be crushed anytime by the two murderous auras.Qin Nan had not said a single thing since the whole ordeal began before him.At the start, being exposed to the murderous intent from Ling Zixiao and those two hundred and twenty disciples caused his body to stiffen and his blood to freeze. Now, with the additional pressure from the five elders, his whole body could no longer stand firmly on the spot, and felt like it would fall to the ground anytime now.Despite that, at that moment, Qin Nan started laughing.Under everyone\u2019s stare, Qin Nan burst out laughing all of a sudden; his laugh was felt like it was self-mocking, and full of disdain, or more accurately, filled with tremendous anger.Everyone was astounded after Qin Nan started laughing.Ling Zixiao yelled with a sinister look on his face, \u201cQin Nan, what are you laughing at? Hmph, I\u2019m telling you, even if you get down on your knees right now, I will not forgive you.\u201d\u201cWhat am I laughing at?\u201d The smile on Qin Nan\u2019s face grew wider as his laughing voice became even louder, \u201cHAHAHA, it\u2019s so funny that you are asking me that question; you don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m laughing\u2026\u201dAfter finishing the sentence, the smile on Qin Nan\u2019s face turned completely into anger.His anger was directed at Ling Zixiao, the two hundred and twenty disciples, and\u2014most importantly\u2014the five elders in the air.Everyone was stunned after seeing the sudden anger on Qin Nan\u2019s face.At this moment, did Qin Nan really show anger on his face? Isn\u2019t Qin Nan supposed to kneel down and beg fearfully for mercy?\\nEven the five elders in the air had not expected this Qin Nan to show his anger.What is he furious about?\u201cI\u2019m but a mere new disciple, with a cultivation base of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm; how am I worthy enough for you all to be hunting me down?\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s tone was icy cold, as he exploded, \u201cThe reason is hilarious; just because you guys are helping Ling Zixiao\u2014fawning over him\u2014you all plan to target and kill me! What gives you all the right to do so?\u201dThis is the reason Qin Nan got mad.Since Qin Nan had arrived at the Mystic Spirit Sect, if Ling Zixiao had not taken the initiative to trouble him, he would not have bothered opposing him.Not to mention that Qin Nan had no personal conflict with these two hundred and twenty disciples.Despite that, in order to suck his balls and receive some benefits from Ling Zixiao, these two hundred and twenty disciples targetted Qin Nan straight away with murderous intent, treating him as their greatest enemy.Apart from that, what Qin Nan least expected was the five elders publicly supporting Ling Zixiao.What gives them the right to do all this?Trying to kill me for no reason?\u201cWhat a joke.\u201d The old white-haired man let out a cold laugh after hearing the words, before saying, \u201cWhy would we bother killing you? Ling Zixiao\u2019s Martial Spirit had reached the ninth-grade Huang rank, and his cultivation base, the ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm; plus you are just a piece of trash. This is the Martial World\u2014only the strong are allowed to live. Death is the only outcome for trash.\u201dLing Zixiao and the two hundred and twenty disciples were in complete agreement with his words.In their eyes, Qin Nan was only a piece of trash; what kind of reason did they need to kill such trash?\\nIt was unnecessary!After hearing this, Qin Nan burst out laughing again, and said with a voice filled with disdain, \u201cOnce, there was a guy who said the same thing to me\u2014that trash must die. He tried to kill me too, but what he didn\u2019t expect was that I would end up killing him. The reason I\u2019m saying this is to ask you all, why do you guys think\u2026 I am just a piece of trash?\u201dThe question caught everyone by surprise.\u201cEven if I\u2019m trash, I have no conflict with you all. However, on this day, you have treated me like nothing more than an ant, and mocked me freely; some even planned to trample all over me.\u201d Qin Nan scanned the area with a pair of sharp eyes, before saying, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll make sure to remember all your faces\u2026 If you decide to kill me\u2026\u201dAfter saying this, eight golden rays appeared behind Qin Nan, together with a giant blurry figure which rose up from the ground and floated behind him; a powerful aura was unleashed as it looked down upon the whole area.In that instant, Qin Nan\u2019s whole aura changed; a overwhelming battle intent encapsulated the entire area, \u201cBring it on!\u201dAt this moment, a single person was roaring at two hundred and twenty disciples at the White Jade Dojo.It was like a tiny ant declaring war at the heavens.This was who Qin Nan was!Although he merely possessed a cultivation of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm; even if his current Martial Spirit had only reached the eighth-grade Huang ranked, he would never back off or be intimidated when facing the murderous intent and pressure from Ling Zixiao, those two hundred and twenty disciples, and the five elders.It was because he, Qin Nan, possessed the Divine Battle Spirit.\\nThe Divine Battle Spirit fights against the Heaven and Earth; there\u2019s nobody it won\u2019t fight, there\u2019s nothing it won\u2019t win against.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you say so, I\u2019ll not waste anymore time talking. Let me see what you got up your sleeves!\u201dThe other new disciples immediately grinned sardonically.Previously, they had agreed to kill Qin Nan because of Ling Zixiao\u2019s offer, and also as a way to pay their respect to Ling Zixiao and Mo Li. Now, deep in their hearts, hatred toward Qin Nan had started to rise up; even if Ling Zixiao did not promise any reward, they would still hunt Qin Nan down.It was because this Qin Nan was too cocky, irrational, and remorseless.Above them, the old white-haired man gave Qin Nan a cold glance, before he yelled, \u201cActivating the transportation portal!\u201dMeanwhile, a brilliant light was emitted from the large formation beneath the White Jade Dojo, which encapsulated every single disciple within it.As the brilliance diminished, all three hundred plus disciples at the White Jade Dojo disappeared.After seeing this, the old white-haired man let out a \u2018humph\u2019 and said with an unpleasant face, \u201cWhat kind of disciples has the sect been recruiting nowadays? Such arrogance with just an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit; if I wasn\u2019t busy with the transportation portal, I would have beaten the crap out of this Qin Nan and turned him into a cripple.\u201d\\nThe other elders nodded their heads in agreement; hostile expressions could be seen on their faces.\u201cHehe, there\u2019s no need to be mad about it. That trash was so smug and offended every disciple just then; there\u2019s no way he could survive after entering the Island of Versatility.\u201d One of the elders said.After hearing the words, the old white-haired man and the other elders nodded their heads; they had given Qin Nan a death penalty in their hearts.\u201cScrew it, there\u2019s no need to get mad over a dead man. Shall we do it in the same old fashion? Let\u2019s have a bet on who\u2019s going to be the first in the trial; will it be Huang Long, or Ling Zixiao?\u201d The old white-haired man said smilingly.The other four presented their views respectively; a high-staked bet had started between the elders.\u2026\u2026The Island of Versatility was located alone on the ocean, with its land covering up to a circumference of a thousand miles; throughout the year, the island was enclosed within a mist called the \u2018Ancient Green Mist\u2019. Unlike the ordinary white colored mist, this ancient green colored mist was poisonous; even experts above the Martial Emperor Realm would not dare to be caught in it.Besides that, on the Island of Versatility, a rich supply of Qi and countless beasts and special plants could be found. It was also filled with unknown dangers, as well as benefits, making it the best place to practice for Martial Artists.As a result, the past patriarchs of the Mystic Spirit Sect spent lots of resources and put in hard work to build a transportation formation on the Island of Versatility which was synchronised with the one beneath the White Jade Dojo in the Mystic Spirit Sect, so that it could be used as a practice ground for the new disciples.\\nAt that moment, on top of a jungle on the Island of Versatility, wave-like ripples suddenly appeared in the middle of the air.Following these, a golden flash was emitted; a figure appeared in the air and dropped immediately to the ground.This figure was none other than Qin Nan.The moment Qin Nan appeared, he immediately executed the \u2018Mystical Eight Steps\u2019. His body turned into a cloud of smoke and landed on the ground.As soon as Qin Nan arrived, a beastly roar was heard coming from the bush beside him; a ferocious tiger sprang out from the bush at Qin Nan with it\u2019s mouth wide open, ready to tear at Qin Nan.The cultivation of the ferocious tiger appeared to be the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm.\u201cF**k off!\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s eyes flickered coldly, as he drew out the saber from his waist instantly, and slashed at his target; an icy saber intent was emitted, slashing toward the beast.The tiger\u2019s golden pupil constricted; before its body could react in time, the powerful saber intent tore it into pieces, making it rain blood.However, it did not end there. Several beastly roars echoed among the trees, as eight ferocious tigers approached rapidly toward Qin Nan\u2019s direction.\u201cThere are quite a lot of beasts here on the Island of Versatility; in just less than five breath\u2019s time, nine ferocious tigers all in the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm have appeared.\u201dQin Nan exclaimed in his mind while his expression remained unchanged. His body sprang forward, as he gathered the saber intent from his Perfection Stage of One with the Saber and unleashed countless flashes, encapsulating the eight ferocious tigers.In just a period of ten breaths\u2019 time, the eight tigers of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm had all been slain.The jungle fell into silence; not a single beast could be seen in the surroundings.\\nQin Nan did not lower his awareness, as he thought to himself, \u201cThe portal had transported everyone to different locations randomly. Therefore, I should use my Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit to see if there\u2019s any disciples near me who might be my enemy.\u201dQin Nan unleashed the Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit without hesitation, and carefully observed everything within three miles away.The reason he was being so cautious was because he had offended two hundred and twenty new disciples, and Ling Zixiao; even though Qin Nan was not scared to offend them, with Qin Nan\u2019s current cultivation base, he would not stand a chance if he bumped into the experts among these disciples.\u201cI must consider myself lucky; not a single new disciple was spawned within three miles of here.\u201dQin Nan let out a relieved sigh; as he was just about to withdraw his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, something special suddenly caught his attention in the surroundings.\u201cThat stalk of grass, shiny like a crystal and half a tree tall, isn\u2019t that the \u2018Spirit Accumulator Herb\u2019? Not only that, not far from it, there\u2019s a log totally black in color, isn\u2019t that the \u2018Ancient Thunder Wood\u2019? This Ancient Thunder Wood can be used to make various defensive equipment or accessories, which would have a calming effect to protect one from sinister forces, making them incredibly precious\u2026\u201dAs Qin Nan continued to mumble to himself, the surprised expression in his eyes continued to grow.In just a brief while, he had found more than ten different precious natural materials within two miles using his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.Although these ten different materials were not extremely valuable, it still indicated that this Island of Versatility was indeed a perfect place for cultivation, as it was filled with countless precious natural materials.\\n\u201cIf there\u2019s so many precious natural materials on this Island of Versatility, and since my Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit is able to detect anything within three miles, does that mean not only I can use them to check if there\u2019s any enemies within three miles, I can also search for any precious natural materials?\u201dWhile having this thought, a hint of excitement started to grow on his face. He had never thought that the Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit could be used in this way.\u201cVery well, I should use my Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit to look for all these precious materials to improve my cultivation.\u201d Qin Nan decided immediately; he then moved out while observing his surroundings with his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit without delay.In Qin Nan\u2019s opinion, his current cultivation was still too weak. He had no way of protecting himself on this Island of Versatility, not to mention that Ling Zixiao and the two hundred twenty disciples were also looking for him.Hence, the priority now for Qin Nan was not to look for the Green Dragon Badges, but to try his best to improve his strength.For the following period of time, Qin Nan began his lengthy search.In the process, he saw two groups of new disciples, but as most of the disciples within these two groups possessed cultivations of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm\u2014which were too powerful for Qin Nan to handle\u2014quick Qin Nan avoided the encounter with the help of the Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.Besides that, Qin Nan also discovered a perfect place to cultivate in seclusion; it was rich in Qi and completely hidden from the outside. It would be impossible to find this place without any special help.\u201cPhew, I\u2019m running out of stamina after executing the Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit and the Mystical Eight Steps non-stop for one hour. I should find a good place to rest for a while.\u201d\\nQin Nan stood on the branch of a giant tree, trying to catch his breath; he appeared to be quite tired.For him, the Mystical Eight Steps was not energy-consuming; the one which consumed a lot of energy, was the Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.It was extremely tiring to use the Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.After resting for an hour, Qin Nan who had recovered his strength, rose up from the ground and sprang forward.However, this time, after travelling less than three hundred meters, he had discovered a secretly hidden swamp lying three miles ahead with the help of the Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.In the middle of the swamp, were a few stalks of flowers; the petals of the flowers were eerily shaped, and violet in color.Upon seeing the flowers, Qin Nan was stunned for a while, before a surprised expression appeared on his face, as he exclaimed, \u201cAre these the Violet Flame Flowers?\u201dAs Qin Nan collected his thoughts, he sprang forward excitedly without hesitation.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He seems to be one of the two hundred and twenty disciples that are targeting me\u2014with a cultivation base of the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm.\u201d Qin Nan said to himself, as a cold flicker flashed in his eyes, \u201cThis Violet Flame Flower must be mine; since this guy is my enemy, if he\u2019s not sensible, I won\u2019t show any mercy.\u201dAfter he finished talking, his body sprang forward with all his might while executing the Mystical Eight Steps.After the time it took an incense to burn, Qin Nan arrived at the swamp, before the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm disciple.The swamp was only around ten meters square; the place was rich in Qi, and in the middle of the swamp stood five stalks of the Violet Flame Flowers. The swaying petals surely looked like violet flames in appearance.Qin Nan stood expressionless on the spot; he was not in a rush to pluck these five stalks.After the time it took for half an incense to burn, a figure landed on the ground forcefully after he sprang out from the woods.\\nThis guy was the disciple Qin Nan saw using his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.As the disciple arrived, he failed to notice Qin Nan at first, as his gaze was totally attracted by the five Violet Flame Flowers in the middle of the swamp; an excited expression could be seen on his face, \u201cHAHAHA, I never thought that this map I got coincidentally would lead me to five Violet Flame Flowers; I, Lee Changyun, am feeling lucky today.\u201dLee Changyun could not help but burst out laughing. In the meantime, he caught sight of Qin Nan in the corner of his eye.At that instant, the smile on Lee Changyun\u2019s face vanished and a hint of murderous intent appeared in his eyes as he yelled, \u201cWho\u2019s there? Are you\u2026 Qin Nan?\u201dLee Changyun was stunned the moment as he realized the person was Qin Nan.There was no one that would not know who Qin Nan was among the new disciples.Especially when Qin Nan dared to burst out scolding them after facing the pressure from the two hundred and twenty disciples, Ling Zixiao, and the five elders, which caused his name to be memorable.Qin Nan stared at Lee Changyun calmly\u2014he did not speak.Lee Changyun, who was stunned at the start, burst out laughing, \u201cHAHAHA, God has been kind to me; not only did he give me five Violet Flame Flowers, he also helped me to run into you here. HAHAHA, after killing you, not only will I be getting some crazy benefits, I will also be recognized by Ling Zixiao and the five elders!\u201dLee Changyun got very excited after saying this.Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation is only the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm; even if this Qin Nan possessed an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, and had mastered the Greater Success Stage of One with the Saber, he would not be a worthy opponent for me.\\nHence, at that instant, Lee Changyun gave Qin Nan the death penalty in his mind, his face full of disdain.What Ling Changyun did not know was that it was not a coincidence that he bumped into Qin Nan; Qin Nan had already seen him before, and waited for him here.After hearing these words, Qin Nan could not help but laughingly say, \u201cLee Changyun, is it? Do you seriously want to kill me so much even though there\u2019s no personal conflict between us? By the way, aren\u2019t you smug, trying to kill me with your current cultivation base?\u201d\u201cYou dare to say I\u2019m smug when you\u2019re but a piece of trash?\u201d A rageful expression appeared on Lee Changyun\u2019s face, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you right now!\u201dAs he finished his sentence, Lee Changyun attacked immediately; his body sprang forward while a punch with the might of the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm exploded toward Qin Nan, as if he was planning to use the punch to shatter Qin Nan to pieces.\u201cMystical Eight Steps!\u201dQin Nan\u2019s expression remained the same, and with a flicker his body floated away like a cloud of dust, dodging the punch with ease.\u201cHmm? Such a powerful movement technique, to be able to dodge my punch like that.\u201d Lee Changyun was slightly surprised, but he soon let out a menacing grin and said, \u201cQin Nan, is this your trump card? Let me show you the real meaning of speed!\u201dAs Lee Changyun\u2019s finished talking, he let out a roar at the sky; seven golden rays appeared before him all of a sudden, together with a giant eagle.It seemed to be Lee Changyun\u2019s beast-typed Martial Spirit: Ferocious Lightning Eagle.\u201cHAHAHA, Qin Nan, speed is the strength of my Ferocious Lightning Eagle Martial Spirit. Even if your movement technique is quite obscene, you are no match for my Martial Spirit. I\u2019ll now lash out with my attacks together with my Martial Spirit, and tear you to pieces!\u201d\\nLee Changyun smirked as the Ferocious Lightning Eagle Martial Spirit behind him growled at the sky; it flapped its wings while grabbing onto Lee Changyun\u2019s shoulders with his blurry claws and taking flight.In that instant, under the movement speed boost from the Ferocious Lightning Eagle Martial Spirit, Lee Changyun\u2019s speed increased rapidly; he sprang at Qin Nan like a gust of wind.Such crazy speed; even Mystical Eight Steps is not enough to escape from it.After realizing this, Qin Nan withdrew the Mystical Eight Steps and stood on the spot; his eyes staring calmly at Lee Changyun.Lee Changyun\u2014who saw Qin Nan remained stationary in place\u2014yelled out with excitement, \u201cQin Nan, it is an honor for you to die by my hands. I\u2019ll now show you my powerful ability: Exploding Avalanche Punch!\u201dFollowing this roar, Lee Changyun\u2019s figure dived toward Qin Nan instantly; he lashed out with his punch against Qin Nan with incredible force.This punch was utterly different than the previous one.Not only did this punch contain Lee Changyun\u2019s full might, it was also filled with an exploding aura, as if it was able to shatter anything; the attack was extremely overwhelming.Ordinary cultivations in the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm could not withstand this attack.\u201cExploding Avalanche Punch? Very well, I\u2019m quite glad to see how powerful the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm is!\u201dQin Nan advanced forward instead of falling back; his whole body was filled with a strong will to battle. He drew out the saber from his waist instantly, unleashing the Saber Intent which had reached the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber, and it instantly spread into the surroundings unnoticed.At that moment, Qin Nan slashed with his blade, producing a loud, shocking BANG; countless Saber Intents in the form of icy cold flashes, poured down from above.\\nFollowing this, Lee Changyun\u2019s expression changed instantly; the previous excitement on his face was replaced by a horrified expression, \u201cWasn\u2019t\u2026 wasn\u2019t your saber intent in the Greater Success Stage? How is it in the Perfection Stage\u2026. AHHHH!\u201dLee Changyun cried in pain before he could even finish his sentence.This single slash from the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber had immediately overpowered Lee Changyun\u2019s Exploding Avalanche Punch; countless Saber Intents landed on Lee Changyun\u2019s body.Even with the strength of the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm, Lee Changyun\u2019s body was sent flying from the attacks of the Perfection Stage Saber Intent; in just a blink of an eye, countless wounds could be seen on his body.\u201cQin Nan, how dare you conceal your true strength; you\u2019ve achieved the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber. Even though I\u2019m not strong enough to face you now, I\u2019ll gather the others along with Ling Zixiao, and you will be a dead man soon!\u201d Lee Changyun shrieked and unleashed his Martial Spirit, trying to escape.He was clear that it was not wise to face Qin Nan who had reached the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber. If he continued to fight, he would surely die.Therefore, Lee Changyun decided to run away without further hesitation.However, Lee Changyun felt like his heart was bleeding non-stop. Those are five Violet Flame Flowers; it\u2019s such a waste that they will end up in Qin Nan\u2019s hands.\u201cTrying to escape?\u201dQin Nan grinned coldly staring at Lee Changyun\u2019s back.In the following second, Qin Nan\u2019s aura switched thoroughly ferocious; he gathered all his might in the saber in his hand, and lashed out with an attack after three breaths\u2019 time.With a swush, the saber attack materialized into a dragon soaring into the sky.\\nThe woods were instantly filled with coldness.This attack was the only skill that was written in the book of the Flying Saber Art: Hundred Steps Soaring Saber.The Hundred Steps Soaring Saber was able to kill anything within a hundred steps when used; it was imperious and difficult to escape from.At that moment, Lee Changyun\u2014who was now sixty meters away\u2014let out a sigh of relief after realizing that Qin Nan was not behind him any longer. With my Ferocious Lightning Eagle, even if Qin Nan had a terrifying movement technique, he still couldn\u2019t catch up to my speed.As soon as he thought there was no more danger, Lee Changyun immediately cursed in his mind, \u201cThis Qin Nan is such contemptible trash, to conceal his strength like that. This kind of trash deserves to die, I\u2019ll make him pay for it the time\u2026\u201dBefore Lee Changyun could finish his words, his body stiffened and his face filled with terror.Before he could react, a flying saber accompanied by a frosty aura came toward him fast and penetrated his back; the Saber Intent in it thoroughly destroyed Lee Changyun\u2019s internal organs.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026 You\u2026 You\u2026\u201dLee Changyun turned around with all his might, and stared at Qin Nan with a shocked and terrified expression\u2014he could not come up with any other words apart from saying \u2018you\u2019.What happened just then?Where did this flying saber come from, giving him the killing blow?What kind of Martial Skill had this Qin Nan mastered to have such terrifying power?At this instant, Lee Changyun reminded himself how disdainful he was in facing Qin Nan before, causing him to be extremely regretful. Despite that, it was pointless to have any regrets now.After letting out a cry in agony, Lee Changyun\u2019s body dropped to the ground, completely dead.\\n\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was never merciful toward his enemies.\u201cLet\u2019s see how many pills this guy has on him.\u201d Qin Nan approached the body and searched him, finding two jade jars. Each jar had ten Xiantian Pills in it.\u201cTwenty Xiantian Pills, this guy is actually quite rich.\u201d A smile appeared on Qin Nan\u2019s face, as he regarded the pills as his belongings now without hesitation.Following this, Qin Nan did not waste any more time; he sprang forward immediately and plucked the five Violet Flame Flowers.\u201cI should go to the well-hidden place I found before, and consume these Violet Flame Flowers.\u201dAs he made this decision, he moved speedily toward his destination while using his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.In the time it took for three incense sticks to finish burning, Qin Nan arrived at a well-hidden cave.The cave was around two meters tall, but it was quite narrow, and was only able to allow one person to enter at a time. Once he went deeper into the cave, he found a pond around thirty meters squared; the pond was clear, with reflections of blue light forming a beautiful view.Qin Nan took out the Violet Flame Flowers, and clenched them all tightly in his fists, turning them into a handful of violet liquid, which was dropped into the pond.The previously clear pond turned violet instantly; a rich amount of Qi was released, and it had a pleasant scent, which was oddly strange at the same time.\u201cLet me try and see how good these Violet Flame Flowers are.\u201dQin Nan took a deep breath and jumped straight into the water.However, the moment he entered the pond, his whole expression changed instantly.\\nQin Nan could only feel a needling pain all over his body, as if countless tiny needles pierced through his pores; the degree of the pain was self-explanatory.Qin Nan took a cold breath; the crazy pain had caused him to contort his face, with voices appearing in his mind telling him to escape from the pond, and the pain.\u201cNo, I won\u2019t leave! With so many people hunting me, I have to raise my power\u2014I won\u2019t leave even if I\u2019m going to die here!\u201dQin Nan let out a deep roar while he endured the extreme pain; he then clenched his teeth and remained in place.Time passed slowly.While Qin Nan was still in the pond, every breath became a challenge as to his limit, as the pain all over his body grew even stronger.At that instant, Qin Nan\u2019s brain felt like a fully stretched string. He had to tried his best to hold the string in place; if he lost his focus, the string would snap in any moment.After five hours, Qin Nan was covered in blood in the pond, as if he had been slashed with a sword countless times.Even though being immersed in the Violet Flame Flower Liquid would not bring any direct harm to the body, due to the extreme pain the skin was torn apart.As expected, while Qin Nan was enduring the terrifying pain, a stream of Qi continued to flow into Qin Nan\u2019s body, tempering his whole body, including the organs.The progress in these five hours, was equivalent to five days of cultivation with the help of his Martial Spirit.\u201cKeep going\u2026 Keep going\u2026 It\u2019s not enough\u2026 not enough\u2026\u201dQin Nan clenched his teeth; he continued to roar and howl in his heart, and his legs were rooted as if there were filled with lead.\\nAt last, after a period of twelve hours, an arcane force was released from Qin Nan\u2019s body, which completely sucked the violet liquid from the pond of water.The water turned clear once again.At the same time, Qin Nan\u2019s twisted face had finally calmed down and returned to normal; he opened his eyes slowly.Following it, a forceful aura burst out from Qin Nan\u2019s body, which now appeared to have reached the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm.\u201cIt\u2019s about time that I reached the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm.\u201d Qin Nan exhaled as an excited expression appeared on his face. He instinctively clenched his fist to feel the enormous power within his body and said, \u201cNot only that, I can feel that the force in my body would not be any weaker than the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm; I\u2019m just lacking some experience before I have a breakthrough to achieve the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm.\u201dNormally, a stalk of Violet Flame Flower would be sufficient to help a cultivator to break the barrier to reach the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm.As Qin Nan consumed five stalks of Violet Flame Flowers simultaneously, the amount of Qi was more than sufficient, causing his power to be on par with the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm.\u201cIf I were to face Lee Changyun now, I could defeat him with just one attack!\u201dQin Nan returned to a calm state.As he was now the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm, with the strength of his body considered to be the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm, he had learned new ways to control his power.For example, a punch from the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm would snap a big tree into halves.A punch from Qin Nan now would cause the tree to explode into dust.Upon reaching the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm, the inner organs now became as strong as the bones and joints; therefore, it was easier for Qin Nan to control his power with precision.\\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s now consume the twenty Xiantian Pills, and see if I can raise the grade of my Divine Battle Spirit to ninth-grade Huang ranked.\u201dWithout further hesitation, Qin Nan unleashed his Divine Battle Spirit, and swallowed the twenty Xiantian Pills.After waiting for a period of time, there was no sign of improvement from the Divine Battle Spirit, which caused Qin Nan to wear a disappointed expression.Including these twenty Xiantian Pills, he had consumed a total of seventy Xiantian Pills, which was equivalent to seven thousand Body-Tempering Pills; the Divine Battle Spirit still had no sign of leveling up after consuming all these pills.\u201cScrew it, I should prioritize on raising my cultivation base. I should go and look for more precious materials with my Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit. Since my cultivation had reached the peak of the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm, if I\u2019m able to find something like the Violet Flame Flower, I\u2019ll be able to raise my cultivation to the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm. I would then have the strength to go look for the Blue Dragon Badges!\u201dAfter making this decision, Qin Nan exited from the cave and started searching around.In the two hours search, he had not found any precious materials, but he had bumped into an unexpected person.A figure appeared from the woods nearby and looked at Qin Nan, before saying with a shocked expression, \u201cQin Nan, is that you? Why are you here?\u201dThe person was none other than Xiao Qingxue\u2019s brother: Xiao Leng.Qin Nan remained silent; he had seen Xiao Leng with his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.The reasons he did not avoid the encounter were; firstly, with Qin Nan\u2019s current strength, there was no need to be afraid of Xiao Leng; secondly, Xiao Leng would not attack Qin Nan due to his relationship with Xiao Qingxue.\\n\u201cYour cultivation has improved?\u201d Xiao Leng was aware of Qin Nan\u2019s change immediately. Despite that, as usual, he had a disdainful look on his face, \u201cEven if you are now at the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm, it doesn\u2019t help at all. You have offended so many disciples, and Ling Zixiao\u2014death is your only path.\u201dQin Nan looked at him calmly and said, \u201cThank you for reminding me.\u201dAs he finished his words, Qin Nan did not stay any longer; he turned around and left, as he was too lazy to deal with this Xiao Leng.Xiao Leng was slightly stunned when he saw Qin Nan was intent on leaving. An unpleasant expression could be seen on his face, as he did not expect Qin Nan to ignore his presence just like that.After a brief hesitation, Xiao Leng clenched his teeth and said, \u201cWait, Qin Nan, there\u2019s something I need to work together with you for.\u201d\u201cWork together?\u201d Qin Nan turned around and stared at Xiao Leng with a playful attitude.Xiao Leng felt his face burning after being aware of Qin Nan\u2019s gaze, and he let out a cold \u2018humph\u2019 and said, \u201cIf you were not the genius my sister discovered, and could not be somehow helpful to me with your cultivation of the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm, I would never cooperate with you.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Without looking at him, Qin Nan replied, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then there\u2019s no need to cooperate.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan turned around again and prepared to leave; he showed no interest at all.\u201cDon\u2019t, wait\u2026\u201d After seeing Qin Nan\u2019s attitude, Xiao Leng\u2019s expression changed and blurted, \u201cThe cooperation this time involves two Blue Dragon Badges. If all goes well, we\u2019ll get one each!\u201dUpon hearing this, Qin Nan\u2019s movement came to a halt, as his eyes started to flicker.\\n\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - The Top Ten GeniusesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57 \u2013 The Top Ten GeniusesQin Nan did not immediately accept the offer; he asked calmly, \u201cBlue Dragon Badges? How do you know where they are located?\u201dBefore the Trial of Versatility took place, the five elders only told the disciples that there would be thirty Blue Dragon Badges on the Island of Versatility\u2014they did not mention the exact locations of these badges.The Island of Versatility covered at least a thousand square miles\u2014it was a very big island. How did Xiao Leng know where the badges were?Xiao Leng said, \u201cOn this Island of Versatility, our seniors from the Mystic Spirit Sect left plenty of maps. These maps show where the precious resources could be found. At the same time, some of the maps would mark where the Blue Dragon Badges were. There were five of these maps, and each map contains two Blue Dragon Badges.\u201dXiao Leng hesitated for a while before continuing, \u201cRumor says that when these five maps are combined together, the remaining twenty Blue Dragon Badges could then be found.\u201dQin Nan was quite convinced after hearing the words.He had only managed to find the Violet Flame Flowers with the help of his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, while Lee Changyun on the other hand, found the flowers following the guidance of a map.Qin Nan took some time to process his thoughts, and then said, \u201cHow do we do this?\u201dEven though Qin Nan\u2019s current priority was to improve his cultivation, finding the Blue Dragon Badges was his goal too.\u201cI once possessed the map, but it was stolen by Wang Meng, who is ranked ninth among the top ten geniuses.\u201d A cold flicker appeared in Xiao Leng\u2019s eyes, as he said angrily, \u201cIf we cooperate, I will deal with this Wang Meng, but handling the other two seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm disciples who are his subordinates would be your job.\u201d\\nAfter saying this, Xiao Leng glanced at Qin Nan immediately.The truth was that, in his true thoughts, Xiao Leng was extremely unwilling to work together with Qin Nan. Apart from looking down on Qin Nan since they had met, he also offended so many disciples previously.However, it was impossible to handle Wang Meng and his followers with his own strength; thus, he was forced to lower his status and team up with Qin Nan.Qin Nan did not tell Xiao Leng his decision, but asked out of interest, \u201cWho are the top ten geniuses?\u201dSince arriving at the Mystic Spirit Sect, Qin Nan had spent his time learning Martial Skills at the Skill Library, or cultivating. He was clueless as to what this meant.\u201cAmong the new disciples, there exists two different rankings. The first one is referring to the top two super geniuses\u2014Huang Long and Ling Zixiao. Behind them, are the top ten geniuses.\u201d A smug expression appeared on Xiao Leng\u2019s face. \u201cAll the top ten geniuses possess Martial Spirits with an eighth-grade Huang rank. They are ranked according to their cultivation base. For example, I am ranked tenth among the top ten geniuses.\u201dAfter finishing the sentence, Xiao Leng glanced at Qin Nan.Normally, Qin Nan would be listed as one of the top ten geniuses, as he possessed an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.However, since Qin Nan had offended Ling Zixiao and the other two hundred and twenty disciples, he was already considered a dead man\u2014thus he was not included in the ranking.\u201cI see.\u201d Qin Nan paused for a while, and then nodded, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll team up with you.\u201dQin Nan did not suspect anything fishy, even though he was not fond of Xiao Leng; he was more trustworthy when compared to the other disciples.\\nThis was because Xiao Leng was Xiao Qingxue\u2019s brother, and Xiao Qingxue had helped him out on many occasions.\u201cI still remember the way to the location on the map, we\u2019ll move out immediately. Although there are some monsters guarding the map, they won\u2019t last long facing Wang Meng and his group.\u201d After Qin Nan accepted his offer, Xiao Leng immediately gathered his strength and sprang forward in a rush with his movement technique.Qin Nan shook his head after seeing Xiao Leng\u2019s reaction; he then followed behind him.The two advanced forward among the wooden braches for a period, before stopping on a big tree.Xiao Leng scanned the area before him while squinting his eyes, and said with a low tone, \u201cDon\u2019t make a sound, we\u2019ll confront them after they finish killing the monsters.\u201dQin Nan nodded his head and concealed his presence, while gazing forward.Before them was a lake, and at the center of the lake was a platform made of stone. On top of the platform were two jade pendants. The pendants emitted a weak, but extraordinary blue light when the sunlight shone upon them.These two pendants were the Blue Dragon Badges.Qin Nan looked around, and found three young men with unleashed Martial Spirits battling against some monsters at the lakeside. The fights were intense, which caused the water of the lake to turn red slowly.Among them, the smug-looking one wearing a golden robe caught Qin Nan\u2019s attention immediately.Behind him floated an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014his Martial Spirit was a sword. The sword was covered in ice, and\u2014as if it was made of dark ice aged over a thousand years\u2014a frosty aura could be felt from it.Besides this, this young lad had reached the Minor Success Stage of One with the Sword; every slash of the sword was accompanied by countless frosty Sword Intent, which caused a part of the lake to freeze, killing a monster equivalent to the strength of a seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator.\\n\u201cThis guy must be Wang Meng; with the Minor Success Stage of One with the Sword, together with a cultivation base of the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm and his Martial Spirit, he could easily kill cultivators of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm. Pretty impressive for the ninth rank among the top ten geniuses.\u201d Qin Nan was slightly astonished, but a frosty murderous intent appeared in his eyes.Although Qin Nan was not familiar with this Wang Meng, Qin Nan could still remember him to be one of the two hundred and twenty disciples who had teamed up with Ling Zixiao.Meanwhile, the number of monsters was getting lesser under the massacre from Wang Meng and his group. After a brief period, every single monster guarding the lake had been eliminated, including a powerful eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm monster.After killing all the monsters, Wang Meng and his followers looked pleased.The two disciples standing beside Wang Meng immediately sucked up to him, \u201cCongratulations Senior Brother, as the monsters are gone now, the two Blue Dragon Badges will be yours, increasing your rank to the top ten.\u201dWang Meng wore a smug expression as he gave the two disciples a complimentary glance and said, \u201cI have now obtained these two Blue Dragon Badges thanks to you two. Without your help, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get the map from that idiot Xiao Leng. I will keep in mind your contributions, and I\u2019ll make sure you two get rewarded when I succeed.\u201dThe two disciples were immediately joyful.However, Xiao Leng\u2014who was hiding on the tree\u2014ran out of patience after hearing these words and yelled furiously, \u201cWang Meng, you stole my map, and dare to curse my name; I\u2019ll make you pay with your life now!\u201dAt the same time, while surrounded by a murderous aura, Xiao Leng sprang at his enemy as a Martial Spirit was unleashed behind him; it appeared to be a sword, which had an archaic appearance, as if it was a weapon from ancient times.\\nXiao Leng immediately executed his strongest ability after showing himself; he grabbed the ancient sword in his hand and gathered his Sword Intent, aiming for Wang Meng\u2019s head.The sudden danger had caused the three to briefly lose their thoughts.As Wang Meng recognized who the attacker was, he laughed disdainfully and said, \u201cLook who\u2019s here, isn\u2019t this my vanquished foe? You dare to come back after I spared your life? If death is what you hope for, I\u2019ll make sure to grant you your wish!\u201dWang Meng had no place for Xiao Leng in his eyes; he let out a cold humph and gathered a frosty aura, unleashing his Sword Intent slashing at the approaching Xiao Leng.BANG!The two streams of Sword Intent collided each other, causing a forceful explosion.Wang Meng was ranked ninth among the ten geniuses, which was one rank higher than Xiao Leng. Even though the two were matched with each other in terms of cultivation base, it seemed like Wang Meng was more experienced in utilizing Sword Arts.As a result, the sudden offense from Xiao Leng had been negated by Wang Meng with ease.Xiao Leng\u2019s expression remained unchanged as he locked his gaze onto Wang Meng and said, \u201cWang Meng, you only managed to steal the map from me with the help of your companions. If you\u2019re a real man, fight me fairly one-on-one.\u201d\u201cOne-on-one?\u201d Wang Meng said with a mocking expression, \u201cWho would want to do that? Let me tell you something; bullying by taking advantage of a greater number of people would always be my intention.\u201dAfter saying this, Wang Meng did not hesitate to give his commands, \u201cLet\u2019s attack together, and give this guy a thorough end to his life right now.\u201dThe other two disciples immediately let out evil grins; they then gathered their might and sprang forward at Xiao Leng, together with Wang Meng.\\nUpon seeing this, Qin Nan who remained hidden on top of the big tree decided to show himself. He leapt down from the tree and said calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair for you three to bully Xiao Leng, who\u2019s alone. If that\u2019s the case, I will team up with Xiao Leng and challenge you three to a duel.\u201dAt that instant, Wang Meng and his group came to a sudden stop, with twisted expressions appearing on their faces.Did Xiao Leng manage to find help?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, if Xiao Leng managed to find a genius disciple as a helper, the outcome of the battle would be unpredictable; thus they were forced to treat it carefully.However, when the three saw Qin Nan\u2019s face, they were all shocked at the same time.Isn\u2019t this Qin Nan?Qin Nan is the helper who Xiao Leng found?Wang Meng was indeed one of the top ten geniuses; he collected his thoughts quickly before he burst out laughing, \u201cHAHAHA, Xiao Leng, I never expected you to find such a piece of trash to be your helper. Actually, I should be grateful that you have brought this trash to me!\u201dWang Meng\u2019s expression became excited after he said this.Previously at the Mystic Spirit Sect, Wang Meng had already promised Ling Zixiao that, if he were to stumble upon Qin Nan during the Trials of Versatility, he would slay him without hesitation. However, as everyone\u2019s location was randomized at the start, even if Wang Meng planned to kill QIn Nan, it would be hard for him to find his target.Why would he not be excited now that Qin Nan was right before him?Not only was Wang Meng excited, the other two disciples were excited too.If they were able to slay Qin Nan here, not only they would receive lots of benefits, Ling Zixiao would also be favorable toward them; there was no reason for them not to be excited.Xiao Leng was not surprised by their reaction, and said in a cold voice, \u201cWang Meng, there\u2019s no point of wasting my time on your bullshit. Hand over the map now, or prepare for a battle!\u201d\\n\u201cA battle?\u201d Wang Meng laughed mockingly and said with a disdainful face, \u201cXiao Leng, you dare to fight me after teaming up with this trashy Qin Nan? Let me give you a piece of advice; since you have brought Qin Nan here as a gift for me, I\u2019m willing to spare your life one last time, so piss off from my sight.\u201dThe other two disciples wore smug expressions on their faces; they did not consider Xiao Leng and Qin Nan to be worthy opponents.Xiao Leng was furious upon hearing this; he did not expect Wang Meng to be so cocksure even at this stage.However, before Xiao Leng could do anything, Qin Nan\u2014who had remained silent the whole time\u2014burst out laughing, \u201cWang Meng is it? I\u2019ve heard that you are one of the top ten geniuses, am I right?\u201dThe words stunned Wang Meng briefly; he then raised his head and said with a prideful tone, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m one of the top ten geniuses, ninth in the ranking. Qin Nan, if you were to kneel on your knees and give me three kowtows now, I will only make you a cripple instead of killing you.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Qin Nan laughed and said calmly, \u201cThe kowtows won\u2019t be necessary. I have only one request; since you were calling me trash, do you have the guts to fight me alone? Of course, if you don\u2019t, maybe you should shut the f**k up.\u201dAt that instant, Qin Nan\u2019s face turned icy cold, as he emitted a murderous aura around him.If Qin Nan had a slightly murderous intent before, his current appearance indicated that he had completely committed to murdering the person before him.Initially, there was no personal conflict between himself and Wang Meng, but apart from verbally insulting him, Wang Meng had even planned on killing him too. Hence, instead of wasting his time talking nonsense, Qin Nan had decided to challenge him to a battle and kill him.\\nBeing merciful to your enemies is unacceptable.However, Xiao Leng, Wang Meng, and the two disciples were stunned on the stop after hearing the words.Qin Nan dares to challenge Wang Meng to a solo battle?Everyone knew Wang Meng possessed an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, and his cultivation had reached the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm; he even mastered the Minor Success Stage of One with the Saber. He was also ranked ninth among the top ten geniuses\u2014a rank higher than Xiao Leng.Even though Qin Nan possesses an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, he dares to challenge Wang Meng to a duel with his cultivation base of the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm?This is suicide!\u201cHAHAHA!\u201d Wang Meng burst out laughing, as if he just heard the best joke of his life; his eyes were filled with disdain, \u201cInteresting, very interesting. Trash dares to challenge me. If you\u2019re looking for a quick death, then I\u2019ll grant you your wish!\u201dFollowing this, he took a big step forward, emitting an imperious aura filled with murderous intent, which caused the heart-rate of the people around to increase.After seeing this, Xiao Leng\u2019s expression changed and yelled, \u201cQin Nan, don\u2019t do anything stupid. You\u2019re no match against Wang Meng.\u201d\u201cXiao Leng, save your breath, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll listen to your advice anyway.\u201d Qin Nan said calmly, \u201cBesides, who says that I\u2019ll be the loser of this battle?\u201dXiao Leng was immediately stunned after listening to the words.Qin Nan is still so conceited at this stage?As he collected his thoughts, he was entirely unsatisfied with Qin Nan\u2019s behavior.He was trying to be kind and save his life, but not only did Qin Nan not listen to his words, he even replied with such an attitude. How could Xiao Leng feel pleasant about that?\\nXiao Leng straightened his face and said in a cold tone, \u201cIf death is what you seek, then I\u2019ll stay out of the way.\u201dAfter finishing the sentence, Xiao Leng leapt into the air and landed on top of a big tree; he stared down coldly at the others.Meanwhile, a furious expression could be seen on Wang Meng\u2019s face as he snapped, \u201cQin Nan, I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019re still able to be so arrogant. I\u2019ll have to witness myself how powerful you are that you got the courage to roar at the disciples from the White Jade Dojo, and now disrespect me like this!\u201dInstantly, an aura from the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm was unleashed from Wang Meng\u2019s body.Along with this, eight golden rays were released, with a long, ice-covered sword slowly appearing behind Wang Meng.At that moment, Wang Meng had shown his strongest appearance.Despite that, Wang Meng was not in a rush to attack; he approached Qin Nan, taking one step at a time with a cold expression, as if he planned to torture Qin Nan slowly to death.After seeing this, the two disciples beside Wang Meng laughed coldly, their faces filled with disdain. One of them said, \u201cThis Qin Nan is ruthless. Senior Brother Wang Meng could even kill an eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator with ease. What does Qin Nan think he has up his sleeves? He is just a piece of trash\u2014I doubt he could survive three attacks from Senior Brother Wang Meng.\u201dThe other disciple smirked after hearing the words, and said, \u201cThree attacks? In my opinion, one attack was enough for Senior Brother Wang Meng to destroy this trash!\u201dXiao Leng continued to coldly spectate without saying anything. In his view, Qin Nan was not as weak as they had described; he could withstand at least ten attacks facing Wang Meng.\\nIn the meantime, Wang Meng\u2019s movement came to a stop before he smiled and mockingly said, \u201cQin Nan, I\u2019ve learned a new Fist Art recently; I\u2019ll let you, a piece of trash, be my tester, to demonstrate the power of my Fist Art!\u201dAfter saying this, Wang Meng lashed out with his attack. His whole body sprang forward at an incredible speed, producing countless forceful gusts.\u201cNine Forces in One, Nine Impacts Battle Fist!\u201dWang Meng let out a huge roar; nine different types of force could be felt throughout his body, which all gathered at his fist, forming a terrifying strength; he then fired it as a punch at Qin Nan, from three meters away.The punch slightly astonished Xiao Leng and the other two disciples.It was because this Fist Art was powerful enough to kill ordinary eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivators!\u201cNine Impacts Battle Fist? Quite an intriguing name, but it\u2019s still a joke if you plan to kill me with this Fist Art!\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s expression remained unchanged as he calmly observed the approaching danger. As the big fist was about to land on him, his whole figure disappeared with a flicker.Movement technique: Mystical Eight Steps.At that instant, Qin Nan\u2019s figure turned into a cloud of smoke and floated away, dodging the murderous punch in an unusual way.\u201cHmm?\u201d Wang Meng was surprised after seeing this.Xiao Leng and the other two disciples were shocked too.They did not expect Qin Nan to have mastered such an advanced movement technique; with just a slight movement, he was able to dodge Wang Meng\u2019s terrifying attack with ease.Wang Meng recovered from the shock and licked his lips before saying, \u201cWhat a surprise, you are not as bad as I thought. But despite having some tricks up in your sleeve, you are still a piece of trash in my eyes!\u201d\\nAfter he finished the sentence, Wang Meng gathered all his might and sprang forward at Qin Nan exuding a murderous pressure.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His movement was unpredictable and as fast as lightning, giving his enemies a hard time to try and capture his whereabouts.Although Wang Meng was powerful, all his attacks had been dodged by Qin Nan with ease.After the time it took half an incense to burn, Wang Meng ran out of patience. His face was twisted with a cruel expression as he let out a deep roar, \u201cQin Nan, stop running around like a tortoise withdrawing its head into its shell. Fight me like a real man!\u201dAt that instant, Wang Meng was furious and full of shame.Who was he?He was ranked ninth among the top ten geniuses, but Qin Nan was able to muck around with just a movement technique, treating him like a joke.The fact was, it was not Wang Meng\u2019s fault at all. The problem was because Wang Meng had never learned any movement technique, and his Martial Spirit happened to be a sword-type Martial Spirit, unlike Lee Changyun\u2019s Ferocious Lightning Eagle which was able to increase one\u2019s speed; hence, Wang Meng had a hard time to catch up with Qin Nan\u2019s speed.Xiao Leng and the other two disciples now looked at Qin Nan differently after witnessing this scene.Previously, they assumed Qin Nan stood no chance battling Wang Meng.However, with just a movement technique, Qin Nan was able to fool around in the midst of the battle.\\n\u201cHmph, Wang Meng, if you\u2019re good enough, try to beat Qin Nan with speed.\u201d Xiao Leng felt like laughing after hearing Wang Meng\u2019s words.Meanwhile, Xiao Leng\u2019s attitude toward Qin Nan had improved slightly; at least Qin Nan was not conceited and smug as he had assumed he was.Wang Meng\u2019s face turned cold after hearing these words, but he could not find anything to say to refute it.In this current situation, Qin Nan would only stop moving and fight him straight on if he were an idiot.However, Qin Nan\u2019s action the next moment was utterly shocking.Qin Nan\u2019s figure came to a stop as he looked smilingly at Wang Meng and said, \u201cIf you say so, then I\u2019ll stop running around and face you upfront.\u201dAfter seeing this, Xiao Leng was astonished and left speechless, \u201cQin Nan, you\u2026\u201dHe was so angry that he could not find any words after this.Just a moment ago, he had a very different view of Qin Nan; he did not expect in the next moment, Qin Nan would reveal his true colors of such a cocksure and smug person.Doesn\u2019t Qin Nan know that with his current cultivation, it\u2019s guaranteed that he would die facing Wang Meng upfront?Doesn\u2019t Qin Nan know that his current action will cost him his life?The other disciples were also utterly shocked after witnessing the scene; they never thought Qin Nan would be so stubborn when his life was at stake.Wang Meng was lost in his thoughts momentarily, before he burst out laughing, \u201cHAHAHA, Qin Nan, now that you\u2019ve said so, you must not regret it if you\u2019re a real man. Now is the time to show you how strong I, Wang Meng, am!\u201dWhile being immersed in the excitement, Wang Meng immediately stepped forward and lashed out with his strongest attack, as he was worried Qin Nan would not keep to his word.\\nWang Meng reached out his hand and grabbed the Icy Sword Martial Spirit in his hand; a stream of Sword Intent was emitted from his body, producing a frosty aura.\u201cFlying Faerie Slash, Ultimate Freezing Strike!\u201dWang Meng let out a loud roar; his aura had reached his peak, as his figure flashed forward and lashed out at Qin Nan.At the tip of his sword, a frosty Sword Intent was unleashed, as if it was going to freeze the woods completely.Xiao Leng and the other two disciples shivered at almost the same time.Xiao Leng stared in disbelief with his eyes opened wide, \u201cHow is this possible? Wang Meng, you have actually mastered the Frosty Sword Art, being able to execute this ability\u2026\u201dXiao Leng suddenly realized something in the midst of his shock and yelled, \u201cQin Nan, run!\u201dMeanwhile, Wang Meng burst out laughing, \u201cRun? It\u2019s too late for that now! Qin Nan, previously you could just turn our battle into a draw by relying on your movement technique. However, due to your smug attitude, you chose to face me straight on instead. Now is my chance to show you my true power!\u201dWang Meng\u2019s aura turned arrogant, as if Qin Nan was already a dead man in his eyes.In addition to this, the two disciples were extremely excited after seeing this.They both knew how powerful Wang Meng\u2019s attack was; hence, there was no way Qin Nan could escape even if he had wings to fly away. His death was guaranteed.While thinking of the benefits they would receive after killing Qin Nan, the two were further enlightened, causing their faces to turn red.However, at that instant, Qin Nan moved; a terrifying Saber Intent was unleashed from his body. It was imperious and powerful.\\nFurthermore, eight golden rays appeared behind Qin Nan; the human figure of the Divine Battle Spirit could be seen floating in the air behind him, which unleashed a forceful aura into Qin Nan\u2019s body.This was Qin Nan\u2019s strongest current appearance; the floating Divine Battle Spirit together with the Saber Intent from his Perfection Stage of One with the Saber.His sudden change of appearance caused Xiao Leng to be shocked\u2014the two disciples were both stunned too.They never expected to witness such a frightening aura burst out from Qin Nan\u2019s body, one which caused them to feel coldness in their hearts.The laugh on Wang Meng\u2019s smile vanished as he said in a shocked tone, \u201cIs this\u2026 is this\u2026 the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber? How\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish the sentence, Qin Nan started to attack, slashing with his saber that was initially on his waist.A frosty reflection of the saber could be seen as a forceful Saber Intent was fired at Wang Meng; it felt like a giant beast tearing at Wang Meng, trying to engulf him.An overwhelming sense of terror appeared in Wang Meng\u2019s mind, as he yelled instinctively, \u201cFrosty Sword Art\u2026 Kill kill kill kill\u2026\u201dHowever, even though Wang Meng executed the strongest skill of the Frosty Sword Art after he lost his mind, even though he had mastered the most powerful skill of the art, nothing could be done facing the slash from Qin Nan. Wang Meng\u2019s attack was completely devoured by the terrifying Saber Intent.\u201cAhhhhh\u2014\u2014\u201dA shrill cry was heard; Wang Meng\u2019s body was torn in half by the Saber Intent, resulting in a rain of blood.Xiao Leng and the other two disciples were utterly stunned by the scene.Their minds went completely blank; they could only remember the sudden flash of the saber, which caused them to feel a bone-chilling coldness, as if they were in an ice cellar.\\nAfter a prolonged period of time, Xiao Leng finally collected his thoughts, although he still wore a shocked expression, \u201cQin\u2026 Qin Nan, did you really master the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber? Did you just kill Wang Meng with a single attack?\u201dThe other two disciples finally reacted after hearing the words. Their gazes toward Qin Nan were no longer filled with disdain, but with great fear and terror.How intimidating was the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber?Even super geniuses like Ling Zixiao and Huang Long would still not have mastered the Perfection Stage of One with the Weapon.However, this Qin Nan before them had mastered it. Furthermore, he had slain Wang Meng\u2014the ninth rank among the top ten geniuses\u2014with just a single slash by using the Saber Intent of his Perfection Stage of One with the Saber.\u201cRUN!\u201dThe two disciples reacted at the same time; they let out a cry and unleashed their Martial Spirit, running away from Qin Nan with all their might.They were absolutely terrified of Qin Nan, who was able to kill Wang Meng with just a single attack, without even really fighting him.If even Wang Meng died before him, how would they match against his strength?Xiao Leng was slightly stunned, as he was still immersed in the shock from Qin Nan\u2019s display of his power. As he recovered from the shock, his expression changed and he said, \u201cDamn it, they were fast to run away\u2026\u201dIn just a short period of time, the two disciples had traveled eighty meters away from them.Even Xiao Leng had no chance of catching up if he were to chase now.Despite that, a cold voice was heard, \u201cTrying to run?\u201dThe one speaking was none other than Qin Nan.\\nAn icy flicker could be seen within Qin Nan\u2019s eyes, who was staring at the two disciples; with the sheath in his left hand and the saber in his right, he immersed himself in the state of One with the Saber. Once again, the Perfection Stage Saber Intent was emitted, producing a menacing aura that encapsulated the whole jungle.Xiao Leng was shocked seeing this, and instinctively asked, \u201cQin Nan, what are you trying to do?\u201dAfter asking the question, a sudden thought came to him as he looked unbelieving at Qin Nan.Is this Qin Nan trying to kill the two disciples despite the incredible distance?The two disciples had already traveled eighty meters away from them; even a ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm expert would have trouble killing the two disciples with this distance.Not to mention Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation base had only reached the sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm; it would still be impossible even though he possessed Perfection Stage Saber Intent of One with the Saber!\u201cFlying Saber Art, Hundred Steps Soaring Saber!\u201dQin Nan let out a roar as he gathered his might and Saber Intent into the sheath and the saber in his hands, which were then fired at his targets.At that instant, it felt like the sheath and the saber had turned into two dragons, soaring into the sky with an incredible speed while they brought a massive force with them.It also felt like two rays of lightning were released in the woods!On the other hand, the two disciples let out sighs of relief after they realized they were now eighty meters away. One of them said with a shocked expression, \u201cIt was lucky that we reacted and ran away instantly\u2014if not, we would surely be dead by now.\u201dThe other disciple collected his thoughts and said, \u201cYeah, who would have thought that this Qin Nan is so terrifying; no wonder he\u2019s so cocky.\u201d\\nHowever, at that instant, the two disciples\u2019 expressions changed and they turned around after feeling a sense of danger.As soon as they turned around, they saw two streams of Saber Intent approach them at high speeds; they both failed to react in time.\u201cThese are\u2026\u201dThe faces of the two disciples were filled with utter shock and terror; before they could say anything, they were slain by the two streams of Saber Intent that appeared from nowhere.Meanwhile, the woods fell silent straight after.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How is it able to kill enemies from eighty meters away?\u201dQin Nan gave him a calm look; instead of answering his questions, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t call me Senior Brother Qin Nan, call me Brother Nan.\u201d\\nXiao Leng\u2019s face went red after hearing the words and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever think that I\u2019ll call you Brother Nan just because you have defeated them\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that it\u2019s not polite to ask someone about their Martial Skills?\u201d Qin Nan calmly said, \u201cNow don\u2019t just stand there. Go and get the Blue Dragon Badges; we\u2019ll split them one each.\u201dXiao Leng was unsatisfied that Qin Nan had no intention of answering his questions, but as he thought about the Blue Dragon Badges, he turned excited immediately. He went up to retrieve the Blue Dragon Badges, and threw one of them to Qin Nan.Qin Nan received the badge and inspected it before putting it into his sleeve; he then said, \u201cXiao Leng, I\u2019ll need to ask you for a favor.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Xiao Leng asked instinctively, who then added, \u201cFeel free to say it, since you\u2019ve done all the work eliminating those three.\u201dThese were Xiao Leng\u2019s honest words.Qin Nan smilingly said, \u201cI\u2019ll need your help to collect the pills, maps, treasures they had. Remember, search their bodies thoroughly, and don\u2019t miss a single pill.\u201dXiao Leng was slightly stunned, before nodding his head. In the Martial Art World, it was normal to acquire the enemy\u2019s possessions after they were slain.Qin Nan glanced at Xiao Leng\u2019s back and calmly added, \u201cOh, I forgot to mention; all the loot will be mine. I won\u2019t share it with you.\u201dXiao Leng, who was on his way to the bodies, almost tripped himself after hearing these words.Qin Nan snicked in his heart, as he felt more pleasant now.At the start, he was looked down upon by Xiao Leng; even though Qin Nan did not show his true emotions to Xiao Leng as an expression of respect toward Xiao Qingxue, he had always shown no mercy toward those who treated him badly.\\nNot long after, Xiao Leng returned with the loot\u2014even Qin Nan was surprised by it.There were about ten jade jars on the ground, each containing ten Xiantian Pills. Besides that, there were also some precious herbs, at least seven or eight of them; these were equivalent to thirty Xiantian Pills if they were traded.However, what attracted Qin Nan\u2019s attention the most were two maps.These two maps were crafted with animal hides, filled with drawings of treasure routes. They even had an ancient feeling to them.\u201cThis map must be the map indicating where the Blue Dragon Badges are, right?\u201d Qin Nan picked one of the map up; the map showed a lake in a drawn circle, and besides the circle was a drawing of a badge.\u201cThat\u2019s right. We would need to collect five of them to find the remaining twenty Blue Dragon Badges.\u201d Xiao Leng said, while his eyes were locked onto the map; he then glimpsed at Qin Nan with a sense of anticipation.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. This map is mine.\u201d Qin Nan ignored his gaze, and took possession of the map without hesitation.He must be joking; I\u2019m the one who killed all of them by myself, did he even do anything?Besides that, Xiao Leng had even mocked him while he was having a battle with Wang Meng; giving him one of the Blue Dragon Badges was already kind enough.Qin Nan then picked up the second map and inspected it thoroughly, before asking Xiao Leng, \u201cTake a look at this map, there seems to be a drawing of a lily on it. What kind of herb is that?\u201dXiao Leng took a look; his expression changed immediately as he said in a shocked tone, \u201cThree-Petalled Golden Lily. This map can guide us to find Three-Petalled Golden Lily!\u201d\\n\u201cThree-Petalled Golden Lily?\u201d Qin Nan frowned his eyebrows. He had never heard of this herb before.Xiao Leng took a deep breath before saying, \u201cThis is the real deal for us. The Three-Petalled Golden Lily, when consumed, will not only raise your cultivation, but also improve your comprehension; in other words, it can improve your Martial Skill Talent. Apparently, the auction price of this Three-Petalled Golden Lily on the market is around two thousand Xiantian Pills each. It\u2019s far more valuable than herbs like the Violet Flame Flower.\u201dAfter saying this, Xiao Leng stared at Qin Nan with his eyes opened wide.\u201cWhat?\u201d Qin Nan was slightly shocked; he did not expect this Three-Petalled Golden Lily to be so valuable.Following this, Qin Nan collected his thoughts and saw Xiao Leng\u2019s gaze; he calmly smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. This map is mine too. But, since you\u2019re Xiao Qingxue\u2019s brother\u2026 I will allow you to come with me this time. We\u2019ll divide the loot equally if we are able to get it.\u201dXiao Leng\u2019s face turned dull after hearing the first half of the sentence; after hearing the second half, he immediately blurted out with an exciting tone, \u201cThank you, Senior Brother Qin Nan! Thank you so much!\u201dQin Nan nodded his head and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no rush to search for the Three-Petalled Golden Lily. Come with me to somewhere first, as I\u2019ll need to improve my cultivation.\u201dAfter receiving a hundred Xiantian Pills and some random herbs, Qin Nan would need to go into seclusion to cultivate for a while. Even though he was able to kill Wang Meng, there was still a huge distance between him and Ling Zixiao.\u201cSure.\u201d Xiao Leng agreed immediately, but as a sudden thought came to him, he hesitantly said, \u201cThere\u2019s some questions that have been troubling me for a while; I\u2019m not sure if I should ask you.\u201d\\nQin Nan glanced at him and said, \u201cGo on.\u201dXiao Leng clenched his teeth before saying, \u201cSenior Brother Qin Nan, I did look down on you at first, but it wasn\u2019t because of your cultivation. It was because I felt that you were too cocky as you dared to offend Ling Zixiao. Not only that, you dared to go against the five elders and all the disciples by yourself; I just felt that you were way too conceited.\u201dHe paused for briefly before continuing, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. With your current talent, even the eighth rank among the top ten geniuses would not be a problem for you. Why won\u2019t you stay low-profile? None of all these things would\u2019ve happened if you had remained low-key. But since you\u2019ve offended so many people\u2014including Ling Zixiao\u2014even if you have overwhelming talent, I\u2019m afraid that when the time comes\u2026\u201dQin Nan interrupted before he could finish.Qin Nan looked at the doubtful Xiao Leng, and smilingly said, \u201cI know exactly what you\u2019re trying to say. I can only tell you this\u2014having a good mindset is important for a Martial Artist. I became a Martial Artist because I wanted to become stronger. I want to roam across the land at will. I want to live freely without restraint. No one can bully me\u2014no one can embarrass me. I will be respected by the people, and kings will bow down before me. If I were to submit to humiliation so easily, why would I want to become a Martial Artist? I will never allow myself to be humiliated\u2014even if it means death.\u201dXiao Leng was astonished.Qin Nan glanced at him before rising from the ground, and calmly saying, \u201cThese words are just some bullshit I came up with. Don\u2019t take it too seriously. The reason I was so confident was because Ling Zixiao and the disciples\u2014or even the five elders\u2014were not powerful enough to force me to submit to humiliation!\u201d\\nAfter saying this, without further words, Qin Nan turned around and left without a sense of the slightest intimidation.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A super genius with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit; one with unlimited potential in the future.Who were the five elders? They played the leading roles in the Mystic Spirit Sect, with great authorities and terrifying cultivation; they were unpredictable.Qin Nan only possessed an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit; what gave him the right to disrespect Ling Zixiao and the five elders?\u201cScrew it, Qin Nan is still too young; he has no idea how scary Ling Zixiao and the five elders are. He will understand when the time comes.\u201d Xiao Leng shook his head to get rid of his thoughts; he sat down with his legs crossed and started to cultivate.Qin Nan had no clue what Xiao Leng was thinking; he was now deep in the cave, sitting down with his legs crossed, with the Divine Battle Spirit unleashed.\\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if these fifty Xiantian Pills are enough to level you up.\u201d Qin Nan took fifty Xiantian Pills and shoved them into his mouth straight away.As usual, the Divine Battle Spirit absorbed the pills with a powerful force.The blurry human figure of the Divine Battle Spirit flickered once under Qin Nan\u2019s high-anticipatory gaze, and returned to its calm state.\u201cIt\u2019s still not leveling up!\u201d Qin Nan was slightly shocked; he then clenched his teeth and said, \u201cAnother fifty Xiantian Pills it is.\u201dAfter saying this, he took out the remaining fifty Xiantian Pills and swallowed them instantly in one gulp.As the fifty Xiantian Pills were absorbed by the Divine Battle Spirit, Qin Nan felt like his heart was beating so intensely that it could jump out through his throat at any second; he was extremely nervous.Since the last level up, Qin Nan had consumed two hundred Xiantian Pills in total, which were equivalent to twenty thousand Body Tempering Pills\u2014it was quite a fortune.If these were still not enough for the next level up, how many Pills would this Divine Battle Spirit need to reach the legendary Xuan rank, or even the ultimate Tian rank?However, this time, the Divine Battle Spirit did not let Qin Nan down.A powerful ancient aura was emitted from the Divine Battle Spirit, as if a primordial being had awoken and slowly opened his eyes; a sense of overwhelming imperiousness could be felt.In that instant, the eight golden rays behind the Divine Battle Spirit transformed into nine golden rays!The Divine Battle Spirit finally ranked up, becoming a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.\u201cA level up at last!\u201d Qin Nan was filled with joy after witnessing the powerful aura unleashed by the Divine Battle Spirit; he would even leap into the air and celebrate if not for his steady and firm determination toward Martial Arts.\\nA ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit; anyone with it would be considered a super genius within the Mystic Spirit Sect.Among the more than three hundred newly recruited disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect, only Huang long and Ling Zixiao possessed ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirits.This proved how powerful and precious a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was.\u201cCalm down, I must calm down.\u201d Qin Nan took a few deep breaths and collected his thoughts, \u201cAlthough the Divine Battle Spirit is now ninth-grade Huang ranked, I should check my speed of cultivating with the help of this ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit!\u201dAfter making this decision, Qin Nan shut his eyes without further ado and began absorbing the Qi around him, while communicating with his Divine Battle Spirit.At that moment, a shocking occurrence took place.A terrifying absorbing force was emitted from the Divine Battle Spirit; countless streams of Qi flowed toward Qin Nan from all directions.These streams of Qi resembled dragons, which curled around Qin Nan\u2019s body and danced around him before diving into his body. It felt like Qin Nan was the king of dragons, causing dragons to gather around him.Even Qin Nan was utterly shocked upon seeing this, \u201cQi Dragon? It must be the Qi Dragon!\u201dAs we all knew, Qi was found floating around throughout Heaven and Earth; only through the Martial Spirit was one able to be immersed in nature and absorb the Qi. As the amount of Qi became thicker, the streams of Qi would take the shapes of the heavenly beasts.For example, Qin Nan absorbing a Qi Dragon would be equivalent to him cultivating for a whole day with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.As such, the difference between the cultivating speed between the two grades was huge.\\nQin Nan inhaled deeply and said, \u201cNo wonder the elders of the sect have high hopes for Ling Zixiao and Huang Long; the difference between an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was incredible, even though it\u2019s only a grade apart. This means that previously, I would\u2019ve needed to cultivate for ten days to match a day of cultivating from Ling Zixiao!\u201dAt that moment, Qin Nan once again understood how important the grade of one\u2019s Martial Spirit was in the Canglan Continent, even if it was only the difference of a single grade.\u201cThere\u2019s no point in thinking anymore; the Trial of Versatility only lasts for a month. I must make use of my time wisely to cultivate as time\u2019s running out.\u201dQin Nan calmed his thoughts and immediately unleashed his Divine Battle Spirit; countless Qi Dragons were being absorbed into his body.Time passed rapidly; five days were gone since Qin Nan started cultivating.Qin Nan continued to engulf the Qi Dragons with a calm appearance; the aura emitted from his body showed a sign of growing.The aura was more powerful than the one possessed by a sixth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator.Meanwhile, a mysterious absorption force appeared all of a sudden within Qin Nan\u2019s body, which swallowed ten Qi Dragons which were initially floating around him.The next moment, a loud crackling noise could be heard within Qin Nan\u2019s body, as if a huge boulder was being demolished into pieces using TNT.After a significant period of time, Qin Nan\u2019s body finally returned to a calm state, and the Divine Battle Spirit behind him started to vanish.\u201cThe seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm in just five days\u2019 time.\u201dQin Nan slowly woke up; his eyes were filled with a hint of joy.\\nHe could feel that his muscles, bones, and organs had grown stronger, as if a clump of sand was turned into a metal plate; a force was flowing continuously within his body, which felt like it was unlimited.If Qin Nan were to battle Wang Meng now, he would be able to slay him instantly with a normal attack. Even if Qin Nan were to fight against any of the top ten geniuses who possessed a cultivation base of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, he would not have any trouble killing them.Every level up in the Body Tempering Realm phase would cause one to have a much better control over strength and power.\u201cOk, now is the time to come out of seclusion and find the Three-Petalled Golden Lily.\u201d Qin Nan calmed himself and proceeded toward the entrance of the cave.Xiao Leng sat with his legs crossed at the outer part of the cave; he was still cultivating with his Martial Spirit unleashed.His cultivation had long reached the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm; after cultivating for the past five days, his strength was improved in a rapid speed, reaching the peak of the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm, causing him to be only a step away from the eighth-layer.After hearing footsteps coming from the inner part of the cave, Xiao Leng opened his eyes slowly and withdrew his Martial Spirit, before saying, \u201cQin Nan, are you\u2026\u201dXiao Leng turned around while he talked, but before he could continue his sentence, an utterly shocked expression appeared on his face.Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation had reached the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm in just five days\u2019 time?That was not the most shocking part; what made him tremble the most was that an invisible imperious aura could be felt from Qin Nan; this aura caused him with his eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit to tremble slightly, as if a servant had stumbled into his king.\\nXiao Leng had only felt the same imperious aura before being emitted from Huang Long and Ling Zixiao.Why am I feeling the same pressure from Qin Nan?Isn\u2019t Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit only eighth-grade Huang ranked? Why does it have the pressure of a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?\u201cWhat\u2026 What is happening?\u201dXiao Leng was completely perturbed.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hence, he immediately said, \u201cDon\u2019t think too much; let\u2019s move out, and search for the Three-Petalled Golden Lily.\u201dXiao Leng\u2019s thoughts were interrupted by Qin Nan\u2019s words as he turned back to normal. Despite that, the shock in his eyes had no sign of vanishing.\u201cThis guy, it seems like he\u2019s hiding his trump card; maybe what he said was true, he does have the strength to compete with Ling Zixiao!\u201d Xiao Leng thought to himself while he stared at Qin Nan\u2019s back. He then stopped his thoughts and caught up to Qin Nan using his movement technique.Following this, with Qin Nan lead the way under the guidance of the map, the two advanced among the woods at high speed.After the time it took for three incense sticks to burn, Qin Nan came to a stop and inspected the map again, before saying, \u201cThe place is just ahead, Xiao Leng, hurry up.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan executed his Mystical Eight Steps, causing his figure to turn into a lightning streak, and vanished among the woods.An astonished expression could be seen in Xiao Leng\u2019s eyes; Such remarkable speed, even someone at the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm would have trouble catching up without an outstanding movement technique, or a Martial Spirit capable of boosting one\u2019s movement speed.Xiao Leng let out a wry smile; he clenched his teeth and gathered all his might to catch up.After ten breaths\u2019 time, the density of the woods started to clear up; Qin Nan\u2019s eyes flickered as he thought to himself, \u201cThis must be the place.\u201d\\nHe leapt into the air and landed on top of a big tree, observing what was before him.After this observation, Qin Nan creased his eyebrows.In front of him was a huge lake, which was encapsulated by a thick white mist; the mist had an eerie feeling to it, and had a tiny red colored hue in it, which was undetectable without looking carefully.Due to the spooky mist, everything within the lake was concealed.The mist on its own was not enough to cause Qin Nan to frown; quite a number of figures could be seen spreading around the lake; they were all new disciples participating in the Trials of Versatility.Qin Nan was familiar with some of the disciples, as they were among the two hundred and twenty disciples who sided with Ling Zixiao.Xiao Leng finally caught up to Qin Nan; when he saw Qin Nan frowning his eyebrows and that he remained in place, he then followed his gaze and looked forward. A shocked expression appeared on Xiao Leng\u2019s face as he exclaimed, \u201cIsn\u2019t this the Blood Barrier Mist?\u201d\u201cBlood Barrier Mist?\u201d Qin Nan looked curiously at him.Xiao Leng took a deep breath and said, \u201cThe Blood Barrier Mist is a type of mist formed naturally, which is extremely poisonous. Even a tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator would die instantly, and his body would vanish due to corrosion after entering the mist; it\u2019s quite terrifying.\u201dAfter saying this, Xiao Leng continued to be stunned as he saw the disciples around the lake.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Why would there be disciples here? Are they here for the Three-Petalled Golden Lily too?\u201d Xiao Leng blurted out three questions as his expression changed.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Qin Nan shook his head and said, \u201cIt seems like the disciples are patrolling around the lake instead of leaving, so they must know that the Three-Petalled Golden Lily is here on the lake.\u201d\\nAt that instant, Qin Nan was extremely bewildered.The only reason he and Xiao Leng knew this place was because of the map they found among Wang Meng\u2019s possessions.How did these disciples know about this place? How did they know there\u2019s a Three-Petalled Golden Lily here?Qin Nan took a deep breath as he decided to leave his questions behind. He observed the lake before him using his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.Even though it seemed like the whole lake was encapsulated within the Blood Barrier Mist\u2014hindering people from seeing what was inside\u2014with Qin Nan\u2019s observation, the Blood Barrier Mist appeared to be vanishing at a very slow speed.Qin Nan thought for a moment, before saying, \u201cThis Blood Barrier Mist would need another two days to disperse. Let\u2019s hide here for the time being; when the time comes, we will find out how these disciples know about the location of the Three-Petalled Golden Lily.\u201dThese disciples who appeared out of nowhere caused Qin Nan to be alert, which was why he decided not to show himself yet.Even though, with his current strength, he had no trouble of eliminating them all.\u201cAlright.\u201d Xiao Leng nodded his head; hiding from the crowd was the best option for now.Meanwhile, eight new disciples dashed out from the woods and landed close to the lake with forceful auras; they had no intention of concealing their presence.The sudden entry of these eight disciples immediately attracted the focus of the other disciples.\u201cWhat is happening here? What kind of mist is this?\u201d The eight disciples who were initially joyful had their expressions change after seeing the strange mist on the lake, and the disciples around them, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Why are you all here?\u201dThe disciples who were initially spread around the lake started to gather; one of them said, \u201cTo be honest, we all found the map of the Three-Petalled Golden Lily, which guided us here. Apparently, the sect has crafted a hundred pieces of this map and spread them around the Island of Versatility.\u201d\\n\u201cA hundred pieces?\u201d These eight disciples straightened their faces after hearing this.Qin Nan and Xiao Leng\u2014who were hiding on the tree\u2014looked at each other with stunned expressions, before a wry smile was seen on each other\u2019s face.They had never expected the Mystic Spirit Sect to be so cunning.Although the validity of the words was still not proven yet, judging from the situation, it seemed like the sect had indeed crafted a hundred maps showing the location of the Three-Petalled Golden Lily, prompting all these disciples to gather here.At that moment, before the eight disciples could recover from the shock, an attractive figure appeared from the woods and landed slowly.It was a woman this time.The lady had shoulder length black hair; she was wearing a long black dress with golden stripes that was kept tight against her skin, presenting her attractive physique. Together with her beautiful face, and a pair of attractive flickering eyes, it caused one\u2019s heart to beat faster after seeing her appearance.The entrance of such a gorgeous woman instantly attracted everyone\u2019s focus.One of the disciples screamed after collecting his thoughts, \u201cChu Yun, it\u2019s Senior Sister Chu Yun. Did she find the map of the Three-Petalled Golden Lily too?\u201dHearing the words, the disciples who were immersed in Chu Yun\u2019s beauty woke up instantly while bearing respectful expressions.\u201cAccording to the rumors, not only is Senior Sister Chu Yun attractive, she also possesses a cultivation base of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm; she is ranked fifth among the top ten geniuses.\u201d\u201cEven Senior Sister Chu Yun is here; who can even compete with her for the Three-Petalled Golden Lily when the Bloody Barrer Mist is gone?\u201d\u201cLooks like we are out of luck this time; I never expected Senior Sister Chu Yun to be here.\u201d\\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe eight disciples who arrived most recently all let out wry smiles as they saw Chu Yun; now that Chu Yun was here, they were convinced that the Mystic Spirit Sect had indeed crafted a hundred maps and spread them across the Island of Versatility.It was the only explanation as to why so many disciples\u2014including the fifth ranked of the top ten geniuses\u2014were there.Chu Yun wore a calm expression, as if she did not hear the discussion among the disciples. She stared at the Blood Barrier Mist for a while, before she turned around and looked in Qin Nan and Xiao Leng\u2019s direction and said, \u201cYou two in the woods, how long do you guys plan to hide?\u201dEven though Chu Yun\u2019s voice was soft and pleasant, it was like an explosion among the disciples.Everyone immediately glanced where Qin Nan and Xiao Leng were hiding full of vigilance.An enemy hiding in the dark was more terrifying than an enemy in the open.If Chu Yun had not said so, they would have had no idea there were two pairs of eyes observing them from the dark.A wry smile appeared on Qin Nan\u2019s face as he was slightly dismayed; since Chu Yun was able to sense their presence, Qin Nan realized that this lady was no ordinary person; a mere cultivator of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm would not be able to detect their presence.\u201cWhat now?\u201d Xiao Leng asked in a low tone; Qin Nan had gradually become his backbone.\u201cWhat can we do? Since we\u2019re already exposed, let\u2019s go down.\u201d Qin Nan gave him a stern look and dropped to the ground from the tree.The moment Qin Nan appeared, the whole place fell silent; every disciple had their eyes opened wide.Even Chu Yun, the fifth ranked of the top ten geniuses, was slightly stunned after seeing Qin Nan\u2019s face.\\nQin Nan was the one hiding in the dark?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He\u2019s here too.\u201d\u201cTsk tsk, I would receive great benefits and make Senior Brother Ling Zixiao pleased if I\u2019m able to kill him.\u201d\u201cHmph, this Qin Nan is way too cocky. I planned to kill him since ages ago; is anyone interested in teaming up with me? We can split the benefits once he\u2019s killed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it, I want to kill him too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn just a brief moment, several among the new disciples had emitted murderous intent; some even teamed up, emitting murderous auras, prepared to lash out with attacks at Qin Nan.No one was surprised by the scene taking place.Previously at the White Jade Dojo, two hundred and twenty disciples had promised Ling Zixiao to hunt Qin Nan down. Not to mention the fact that Qin Nan had unleashed his rage in front of the whole crowd, offending everyone present at the dojo.\u201cHehe, do you guys really think you are matched against Senior Brother Qin Nan?\u201d At that moment, an icy voice was heard as Xiao Leng walked out from the woods at a slow pace and stared coldly at the ferocious looking disciples, \u201cIf anyone dares to attack him, I\u2019ll show no mercy.\u201dAs soon as Xiao Leng appeared, one of the disciples blurted out, \u201cXiao Leng? Isn\u2019t he the tenth ranked among the top ten geniuses?\u201dAfter hearing this, those who were previously directing their murderous intents at Qin Nan were shocked.\u201cWhat? Xiao Leng has teamed up with Qin Nan?\u201d\\n\u201cF**k. Now that Qin Nan is being protected by Xiao Leng, things are getting complicated.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you guys know? Xiao Leng is Xiao Qingxue\u2019s brother\u2014of course he would be helping Qin Nan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe initially ferocious looking disciples withdrew their murderous intent as soon as Xiao Leng arrived, not daring to offend him.Even though Qin Nan was nothing in their eyes, Xiao Leng who was ranked tenth among the top ten geniuses was not someone they dared to offend.Chu Yun, who was standing to the side, glanced at Qin Nan with a pair of flickering eyes and said with a soft tone, \u201cI did not expect Junior Brother Qin Nan to improve from the fifth-layer to seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm in just a few days\u2019 time\u2014I\u2019m quite impressed.\u201dChu Yun words instantly scared the disciples to death.Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation has reached the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm?Even those with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirits would not be able to level up twice in just a few days\u2019 time, right?Has Qin Nan really done something that even the ninth-grade Huang ranked super geniuses can\u2019t do?While the disciples were immersed in extreme shock, they were totally bewildered too.Despite being confused, they immediately felt lucky and glanced at Xiao Leng with a hint of gratitude.Everyone knew Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit was eighth-grade Huang ranked; now that his cultivation had reached the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm, who among them would be able to face him?If Xiao Leng did not appear and stop them from attacking Qin Nan, they would be dead by now.Qin Nan smiled calmly after hearing her words and said, \u201cIn terms of cultivating speed, mine is unmatched against Senior Sister Chu Yun\u2019s; the reason I leveled up twice in such a short time was because of some fortunate encounters on this Island of Versatility.\u201d\\n\u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, not everyone could even have fortunate encounters and level up twice.\u201d Chu Yun let out an attractive smile and said, \u201cIn my opinion, being lucky is also considered a strength.\u201dQin Nan glimpsed at her; this Chu Yun is really smart with her words.This caused Qin Nan to be doubtful; now that I\u2019ve offended almost all of the new disciples, is this Chu Yun a friend, or an enemy?Chu Yun seemed to know what Qin Nan thoughts were; she smilingly said, \u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, don\u2019t you worry. I won\u2019t attack you even if everyone here wants to kill you. Prior to the start of the Trials of Versatility, Senior Brother Gong Yang had already mentioned you to me, and asked me to befriend you.\u201dThese words caused the disciples to be stunned once again.Although they had no idea who Gong Yang was, judging from her words, it seemed like Chu Yun would be siding with Qin Nan too.Qin Nan was a little surprised; he did not expect Chu Yun to have contact with Gong Yang.\u201cPlease let Senior Brother Gong Yang know my appreciation if you\u2019ve got the chance.\u201d Qin Nan brought his fists together and said honestly.Even though he had only met Gong Yang recently, he was quite moved that Gong Yang was willing to assist him secretly.As for Xiao Leng, who was standing behind Qin Nan\u2014he had no idea what was going on.Meanwhile, Chu Yun stared at Qin Nan, a hint of curiosity could be seen deep in her eyes.Unlike these new disciples, she clearly knew that Senior Brother Gong Yang was in the top ten among the inner disciples of the sect; even Ling Zixiao and Huang Long were incomparable to him.Qin Nan only has an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and a cultivation base of the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm; why is Senior Brother Gong Yang so fond of him?\\nBesides that, from Chu Yun\u2019s observation, Xiao Leng was entirely respectful toward Qin Nan; he did not side with Qin Nan just because his sister was Xiao Qingxue.Why would Xiao Leng, the tenth ranked of the top ten geniuses, respect Qin Nan so much?\u201cWhat an interesting guy.\u201d Chu Yun thought in her mind.At that instant, the disciples found themselves staring at each other.Now that Chu Yun, Xiao Leng, and Qin Nan are all here for the Three-Petalled Golden Lily, did they really want to stay?It was impossible to compete against these three with their current strength.After having this thought, many disciples decided to leave even though they were quite unwilling to do so.If they were to waste their time here, they would end up not able to get the Three-Petalled Golden Lily, or even getting themselves killed; it would be smarter to go and look for other fortunate encounters on this Island of Versatility.However, at that instant, a gloomy voice appeared all of a sudden, \u201cTsk tsk, why are there so many people here? Even Chu Yun and Xiao Leng, two of the top ten geniuses are here too. It looks like everyone knows that this is where the Three-Petalled Golden Lily is. What I did not expect most was to find this trashy Qin Nan here too.

His appearance had a spooky feeling to it, which caused one to shiver.Upon seeing the newcomer, a disgusted expression could be seen on Chu Yun\u2019s face as she said, \u201cChilde Gloomy Rage, you\u2019re here too.\u201dAfter hearing the words, all the disciples\u2019 expressions changed, and they began breathing heavily.\u201cChilde Gloomy Rage? It\u2019s him?\u201d*Cough* \u201cChilde Gloomy Rage, the fourth rank among the top ten geniuses, very terrifying.\u201d\u201cBesides that, it is said that this Childe Gloomy Rage loves to kill; if you dare to stare him straight in the eyes, he will murder you straight away. Once, a seventh-grade Huang ranked genius got himself killed after talking back to him.\u201d\u201cTsk tsk, things are getting interesting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThose who initially planned to leave stopped in their tracks after seeing the arrival of Childe Gloomy Rage. They could not help but glance at Qin Nan with mocking expressions.From Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s words, it seemed like he planned to attack Qin Nan soon.Even though they were mismatched against Qin Nan, Childe Gloomy Rage was ranked fourth among the top ten geniuses; even if Qin Nan were being protected by Xiao Leng, he would not be able to handle Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s wrath.After seeing the arrival of Childe Gloomy Rage, Xiao Leng straightened his face and said in a low voice, \u201cQin Nan, don\u2019t be impulsive; even though his cultivation base is only the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, it is said that this man mastered a terrifying Evil Art; even Chu Yun is mismatched against him\u2026\u201d\\nQin Nan nodded his head; he had sensed the murderous intent from this Childe Gloomy Rage after he arrived, but his expression remained unchanged despite the pressure.Childe Gloomy Rage smirked at Chu Yun and said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I come if you guys can? Plus, it seems like coming here is the right choice, as I have found my prey.\u201dHe then turned toward Qin Nan and said in a spooky tone, \u201cQin Nan, I\u2019ll give you three breaths\u2019 time; kneel before me now, and I\u2019ll spare your life. If you dare to oppose me, I\u2019ll teach you the reason that you should beg for your death.\u201dAfter hearing this, the disciples instantly glanced at Qin Nan with scornful expressions.They were interested in seeing what would happen next; previously this Qin Nan dared to roar at everyone in the White Jade Dojo. Does he dare to be so smug facing Childe Gloomy Rage?Xiao Leng\u2019s face turned cold as he snapped, \u201cChilde Gloomy Rage, Senior Brother Qin Nan has no personal conflict with you. Why do you want to kill him?\u201d\u201cSenior Brother?\u201d Childe Gloomy Rage glanced at Xiao Leng with a disdainful look and said, \u201cXiao Leng, how could you submit to this trash, and call him Senior Brother? Since that\u2019s the case, I demand you two kneel before me; if not, have a taste of my power.\u201dChilde Gloomy Rage said with an imperious tone, as if Qin Nan and Xiao Leng were nothing in his eyes.Xiao Leng\u2019s expression changed as flames of fury rose within him; he did not expect this Childe Gloomy Rage to be so cocky.At this moment, Qin Nan\u2014who remained silent previously\u2014finally spoke with a menacing tone, \u201cChilde Gloomy Rage is it? You dare to call yourself a childe when you\u2019re just a shorty? My thoughts are exactly what Xiao Leng said; I have no personal conflict with you, but you insisted I kneel down before you, and even wanted to teach me about death. If you say so, let me see how good you are, you little shorty!\u201d\\nEveryone was dumbfounded, including Xiao Leng and Chu Yun.They did not think that Qin Nan would be so ruthless facing a super genius like Childe Gloomy Rage; he dared to talk back with strong words, aiming at Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s weakness.Isn\u2019t Qin Nan worried that this Childe Gloomy Rage would go berserk?After hearing the words, Childe Gloomy Rage paused, before his pale face twisted like a ferocious looking devil.Since he was young, his height had been restrained due to his Martial Spirit and his health condition; hence, it had always been his tender spot. If anyone mentioned his height, he would seek revenge in the cruelest way, and torture the person.Despite that, this trashy Qin Nan dared to call him short?Unacceptable!\u201cWell, well, well.\u201d Childe Gloomy Rage squeezed the words out while wearing an extremely contorted face and emitting a murderous aura, \u201cSuch a piece of trash dares to call me short. Do you really think that you are worthy enough to be my opponent with your seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation? I\u2019ll show you the reason why you shouldn\u2019t have offended me!\u201dToward the end of the sentence, Childe Gloomy Rage raised his pitch suddenly into a sharp tone; meanwhile, an eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm aura was unleashed from his body.The disciples were excited to see Childe Gloomy Rage go berserk; they were looking forward to seeing Qin Nan being torn apart by him.\u201cStop it!\u201dAt that moment, a yell was heard.Chu Yun\u2019s appeared before Qin Nan with a flash; her beautiful face turned cold as she said, \u201cChilde Gloomy Rage, Qin Nan is my friend. If you were to attack him today, then I\u2019ll team up with them and fight against you.\u201dAfter saying this, a forceful aura burst out from Chu Yun\u2019s body.\\nAll the disciples were shocked seeing this\u2014they did not expect Chu Yun to go against Childe Gloomy Rage for Qin Nan\u2019s sake.Even Qin Nan was slightly stunned as he did not think that Chu Yun would defend him.As a matter of fact, Chu Yun let out a wry smile in her mind; even though she disliked Childe Gloomy Rage, he was not her life and death enemy. However, due to Gong Yang\u2019s request, plus the fact that she was interested in Qin Nan too, she could not stand aside and witness Qin Nan dying in Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s hands.Upon knowing that this would mean another powerful enemy for her, Chu Yun could not help but roll her eyes at Qin Nan.If this guy wasn\u2019t offensive with his words, not knowing how to keep his mouth shut, why would Childe Gloomy Rage be so furious?Childe Gloomy Rage stared coldly at Chu Yun with his squinted eyes and said, \u201cChu Yun, are you sure that you want to side with this trash?\u201dChu Yun took a deep breath and said with a firm tone, \u201cChilde Gloomy Rage, I can apologize on behalf of Qin Nan for his disrespectful words. However, if you were to attack Qin Nan, then I\u2019ll side with him. Besides that\u2026\u201dBefore Chu Yun could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by someone.The one interrupting was none other than Qin Nan.Qin Nan said with a calm smile, \u201cSenior Sister Chu Yun, there\u2019s no need to waste your time. If Childe Gloomy Rage wants to kill me, then let him try. I find it hard to believe that this little shorty is strong enough to kill me!\u201dThe whole place fell silent after these words were spoken.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Go ahead and battle with Childe Gloomy Rage.\u201dAfter saying this, Chu Yun leapt into the air and landed ten meters away, spectating with a straight face.Although Senior Brother Gong Yang had sincerely asked her to assist Qin Nan, since Qin Nan was so full of himself, she planned to teach him a lesson; if Qin Nan\u2019s life were in danger later, she would then rescue him.Xiao Leng remained speechless, and silently withdrew from the scene.As soon as Childe Gloomy Rage appeared, he had scolded Qin Nan as a piece of trash; when he demanded Qin Nan kneel before him, Xiao Leng clearly knew that Qin Nan would not let this go so easily. In his opinion, Qin Nan was someone who held firm onto his principles; if someone were kind to him, he would return the favor sincerely. If someone wanted to kill him, he would not forgive them so easily.\\nChilde Gloomy Rage hesitated briefly, before he burned with rage.Since when have I, Childe Gloomy Rage, allowed a piece of trash to continuously humiliate me?\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for death, then I\u2019ll grant you your wish!\u201d Childe Gloomy Rage let out a devastating roar; an incredible force was emitted from his tiny body. He held his hands like a pair of claws and tore at Qin Nan with an icy cold aura.The claw attack caused the disciples to be shocked.If they were in Qin Nan\u2019s shoes, they had no chance of defending themselves against this attack.Qin Nan remained calm and took a step forward, executing the Mystical Eight Steps that caused his figure to vanish and dodge the terrifying attack with ease.Every disciple including Chu Yun was shocked witnessing this.As their cultivation bases were not too weak, they were able to tell that Qin Nan was executing an incredible movement technique, which he had perfectly mastered; his speed was unmatched against cultivators of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm.Unfortunately, Qin Nan\u2019s opponent was Childe Gloomy Rage.Who was Childe Gloomy Rage?He was ranked fourth among the top ten geniuses; even though Qin Nan\u2019s speed was quite astonishing, it was but a child\u2019s trick before Childe Gloomy Rage.\u201cQin Nan, is this all you\u2019ve got? Hmph, do you really think you are allowed to be smug in front of me just because you have mastered a movement technique?\u201d While wearing a spooky expression, Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s raised his speed tremendously in that instant, and he became as fast as lightning.One of the disciples who was relatively knowledgeable immediately exclaimed, \u201cThis is the Thunder Flashing Steps; one\u2019s movement will be fast as lightning with it.\u201dChilde Gloomy Rage was able to catch up to Qin Nan\u2019s speed instantly after executing the Thunder Flashing Steps.\\nChilde Gloomy Rage let out a spooky laugh and said, \u201cQin Nan, not so cocky now, eh? Let me show you one of my killing abilities: Spirit Locking Chain!\u201dAt that instant, Childe Gloomy Rage dragged out a dark iron chain from his waist; his aura was boosted instantly, emitting a stream of Chain Intent from his One with the Chain state toward his surroundings.It felt like a gust of icy wind had just blown past the woods, causing those with a weaker cultivation to shiver.Upon seeing this, Chu Yun\u2019s expression changed slightly, \u201cGreater Success Stage of One with the Weapon?\u201dAt that instant, every disciple was astonished.\u201cGreater Success Stage of One with the Weapon? What a surprise indeed that Childe Gloomy Rage managed to achieve this strength.\u201d\u201cHAHAHA, Qin Nan has no hope of surviving; even a ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator would die facing the Greater Success Stage of One with the Weapon.\u201d\u201cTsk tsk, I don\u2019t think three attacks are necessary; a single attack is enough to slay Qin Nan!\u201d\u2026\u2026Chu Yun inhaled deeply as a serious expression was seen on her face; she gathered all her might ready to sprang out at anytime; even though she planned to trouble Qin Nan as she was not fond of his smug attitude, but she would not let Qin Nan die due to Senior Brother Gong Yang\u2019s request.Therefore, she had to interfere and save Qin Nan when the time came.Meanwhile, Childe Gloomy Rage\u2014who had unleashed his strength of the Greater Success Stage of One with the Weapon\u2014flicked his wrist, causing the dark chain to spring toward Qin Nan\u2019s head like a deadly serpent from hell.The attack was extremely ferocious, as if a demon had appeared to hunt Qin Nan\u2019s soul with its claws reaching out.\\nAfter seeing this, all the disciples were absolutely terrified, as a sense of coldness filled their hearts.Chu Yun held her breath and gathered her might as she readied a powerful blow in order to save Qin Nan.\u201cIs that it?\u201dDespite facing a terrifying attack from Childe Gloomy Rage, Qin Nan smirked and stomped his foot hard on the ground; a menacing and imperious Saber Intent was emitted all of a sudden, encapsulating the area.The Perfection Stage of One with the Saber, unleashed!At that moment, the bone-chilling Intent unleashed by Childe Gloomy Rage was completely overwhelmed by the powerful Saber Intent.Upon seeing this, the smirk on Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s face disappeared\u2014his face was filled with an utter shock.Not only him, Chu Yun and the disciples held their breaths after seeing this with astonished expressions.Is this Saber Intent at the Perfection Stage?Has Qin Nan mastered the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber?\u201cHow is this possible? Qin Nan had only reached the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm; how could he have mastered the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber? Even a super genius like Ling Zixiao had yet to master the Perfection Stage of One with the Weapon when he was still at the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm!\u201d An unbelieving expression was seen in Chu Yun\u2019s attractive eyes.Childe Gloomy Rage was indeed a top genius, who soon gathered his thoughts and said in a shrill voice, \u201cQin Nan, how could a trash like you master the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber?\u201dAfter saying this, Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s attack came to a halt as his figure moved backward rapidly.He clearly knew that even with his eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm and the Greater Success Stage of One with the Weapon, he would not have any advantage fighting Qin Nan now; he might even find himself on the weaker side.\\nNot to mention that Chu Yun and Xiao Leng were ready to join the battle at any time.It was obvious that Chu Yun and Xiao Leng would not remain stationary; if he were placed in a disadvantaged situation during the battle against Qin Nan, Chu Yun and Xiao Leng would lash out with their strongest attacks and eliminate him with the combined force.He was not afraid to face Qin Nan alone, but he would definitely lose facing the three.As a result, after realizing that he could not slay Qin Nan in a single attack, Childe Gloomy Rage immediately halted his movement and withdrew his attack.After taking a deep breath, trying to restrain his unwillingness in his mind, he said with a cold face, \u201cQin Nan, consider yourself lucky this time. It won\u2019t be the same the next time I see you.\u201dAfter saying these words in a cold tone, Childe Gloomy Rage instantly left the area with his Thunder Flashing Steps.Everyone was shocked after witnessing this.Did the famous Childe Gloomy Rage just flee for his life?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, it seemed like Qin Nan had the strength to challenge him.Despite that, what Qin Nan did next was totally unexpected by everyone.\u201cTrying to escape? Not this time!\u201dQin Nan grinned coldly as his eyes flickered strangely staring at the woods afar while he gathered his might. Before he left, he said calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare to follow me; those who do so would be considered as my enemies.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan boosted his speed and chased forward using his Mystical Eight Steps.The disciples were once again utterly shocked.They would never have expected Qin Nan to pursue Childe Gloomy Rage on his own after driving him away.Does Qin Nan plan to slay Childe Gloomy Rage by himself?Not a single stupid disciple was at the scene; they clearly knew that Childe Gloomy Rage decided to flee for his life due to his concerns of Chu Yun and Xiao Leng joining the battle. If Qin Nan were on his own, even if he mastered the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber, he would not be able to scare Childe Gloomy Rage away so easily.\\nChilde Gloomy Rage\u2019s cultivation had reached the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, and he had mastered the Greater Success Stage of One with the Weapon. On the other hand, Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation base was only the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm; a layer difference between the two.\u201cTrying to kill Childe Gloomy Rage, not satisfied with just driving him away; has Qin Nan gone mad?\u201d\u201cTsk tsk, this Qin Nan was way too smug; I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s digging his own grave.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, why would Childe Gloomy Rage be afraid if Qin Nan was on his own?\u201d\u2026\u2026The respect in the disciples\u2019 minds was replaced by disdain after they collected their thoughts.Upon hearing this chatter, Chu Yun\u2019s expression changed slightly; she did not expect Qin Nan to be so lustful for blood, planning to take down Childe Gloomy Rage by himself.What\u2019s the difference between this and committing suicide?\u201cThis guy is too full of himself.\u201d Chu Yun said. Despite the fact that she wanted to save Qin Nan, it was no longer possible as Qin Nan and Childe Gloomy Rage were out of her sight in just a few seconds.Chu Yun could only pray, hoping Qin Nan would survive. If Qin Nan were to die, she would not know how to report back to Senior Brother Gong Yang.\u2026\u2026Using his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, Qin Nan had his focus locked onto Childe Gloomy Rage and chased behind him.Not far ahead, Childe Gloomy Rage made his away forward among the woods with an unpleasant and murderous face.He had never suffered such a disgrace since he was born. Not only he was humiliated, he was forced to flee from the scene.\u201cThis trash Qin Nan, I\u2019ve spared your bastard\u2019s life this time. Next time when you are alone, I\u2019ll show you a piece of my wrath.\u201d Childe Gloomy Rage cursed furiously in his heart.\\nIf Chu Yun and Xiao Leng were not there, he would not be intimidated and driven away despite Qin Nan mastering the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber.At that moment, Childe Gloomy Rage hesitated and with his face down before coming to a sudden stop and saying, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dFollowing this, Childe Gloomy Rage saw Qin Nan walking out slowly from the trees by himself.Childe Gloomy Rage was utterly surprised. He did not expect Qin Nan to take the initiative to pursue him.His expression changed slightly as he immediately scanned the surroundings. If Qin Nan is here, does that mean both Chu Yun and Xiao Leng are nearby too?Qin Nan knew what Childe Gloomy Rage was thinking; he said calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m alone this time. There\u2019s no need to team up with others just to defeat you. I can do it by myself.\u201dChilde Gloomy Rage remained silent; he did another thorough scan at the surroundings. As he realized there were no one around, he could not help but burst out laughing; he was entirely bemused by Qin Nan\u2019s attitude, \u201cWell, well, well. You dare to chase me down even after I fled from the battle? What gives you the confidence to hunt me down just by yourself?\u201dUpon saying this, a bursting aura emitted from Childe Gloomy Rage as he immersed himself into the Greater Success Stage of One with the Weapon.With a scornful attitude, Childe Gloomy Rage smirked and said, \u201cQin Nan, do you really think you\u2019re invincible after mastering the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber? Let me be honest with you; why would I leave if Chu Yun and Xiao Leng weren\u2019t there?\u201d\u201cStop the nonsense.\u201d A cold flicker appeared in Qin Nan\u2019s eyes as he burst out a Saber Intent with his Perfection Stage of One with the Saber and said, \u201cShow me your most powerful skill; come on, show me what you\u2019ve got!\u201d\\n\u201cVery well!\u201dAt this moment, Childe Gloomy Rage forced himself to recover from his enraged state and said with a chilling tone, \u201cQin Nan, you chose to take the path of hell instead of the heavens! Let me show you my strongest ability\u2014eat this!\u201dAfter saying this, eight golden rays appeared behind Childe Gloomy Rage.An enormous devil could be seen standing on the ground like a hill; not only that, countless thunder could be seen emitting from the devil\u2019s figure, producing a horrendous aura.At that instant, the atmosphere in the woods turned icy cold instantly, as if winter had just arrived.\u201cHAHAHA, Qin Nan, see this? This is my Martial Spirit, Spooky Thunderous Devil!\u201d Childe Gloomy Rage leapt into the air and looked down upon his opponent before bursting out laughing, \u201cI know your Martial Spirit is eighth-grade Huang ranked. Unfortunately, my Martial Spirit specializes in killing; the strongest blow from us combined together could slay a ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator instantly!\u201dAfter saying this, Childe Gloomy Rage let out a devastating roar.His short figure slowly merged with the Gloomy Thunderous Devil Martial Spirit, as if he was turning into a demon.After merging with his Martial Spirit, Childe Gloomy Rage yelled, \u201cGloomy Thunderous Soul-Hunting Chain!\u201dChilde Gloomy Rage then drew out the chain from his waist and whipped lightning fast at Qin Nan.This attack was totally different from the previous one.The attack was accompanied by countless thunder sparks that were emitted from the chain. Not only that, a powerful force could be felt within the chain, like the rumbling of the sea and shattering of the mountains, it could destroy and eliminate anything.This force was the one possessed by Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s Martial Spirit.Even a ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator would shatter into pieces upon receiving this attack.\\nAt that instant, Childe Gloomy Rage could not hold his laughter in; he initially nursed a grievance, but he never thought Qin Nan would be so smug as to chase him down on his own; it felt like a lamb had volunteered itself to be sent before a wolf.Qin Nan was considered a dead man in Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s eyes.\u201cMerging with the Martial Spirit? Interesting.\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s expression remained the same facing the powerful attack; he said in a calm tone, \u201cIf that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got, then it\u2019s time for me to present my Martial Spirit.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan finally moved; he took a big step forward with ease.At that instant, nine golden rays appeared behind Qin Nan, together with a blurry figure of the Divine Battle Spirit, emitting an imperious aura.Following this, the trees shook wildly from the shock; everything felt insignificant before the Divine Battle Spirit.The evil grin on Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s face went stiff after he witnessed the scene before him.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Spirit was too shocking; previously it was only eighth-grade Huang ranked, how did it suddenly now become ninth-grade Huang ranked?\\nSuch a shocking and terrifying scene happening before him caused him to lose his mind, and to be filled with endless terror.Even if he were given ten guts now, he would not dare to be the enemy of Qin Nan.Looking at the fleeing figure, a smirk appeared on Qin Nan\u2019s face as he drew the saber from his waist with a whisk. Strong Saber Intent revolved around him as he gathered all his might; he then flung the saber, causing it to spring forward with a destructive aura.Flying Saber Art, Hundred Steps Soaring Saber!Childe Gloomy Rage\u2014who was running for his life ahead\u2014became aware of a sense of danger and instinctively turned around.Following this, a blade flash could be seen coming fast toward him from afar, penetrating his eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm body, and destroying his internal organs instantly.\u201cHow\u2026 how\u2026 how\u2026\u201dChilde Gloomy Rage opened his eyes wide in disbelief; he appeared to have something to say, but was unable to say it. Following that, he shrieked.The blow had killed him.In the last few seconds\u2014in the midst of endless pain\u2014Childe Gloomy Rage remembered his disdain and smugness toward Qin Nan; a sense of regret soon arose in his heart.I dared to look down on a ninth-grade Huang ranked cultivator?I dared to treat a ninth-grade Huang ranked super-genius disdainfully?Such a joke\u2014such recklessness.However, it was far too late for repentance. Filled with regret, shock, pain, and terror, Childe Gloomy Rage, ranked fourth among the top ten geniuses, exhaled his last breath and finally died.After seeing his, Qin Nan withdrew his Divine Battle Spirit and approached the body calmly.He never had any personal conflict with Childe Gloomy Rage; it had been him who called him trash, and demanded he to kneel before him. Therefore, when Childe Gloomy Rage fled for his life, Qin Nan followed without hesitation.\\nHe was never merciful when facing his enemies, and he never allowed them to escape.As usual, Qin Nan reached out his hands and searched Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s body, revealing a huge loot.On his body, there were lots of hidden weapons, including flying daggers and arrows with poison applied to the tips, which were used for unexpected attacks.Besides that, what astonished Qin Nan was finding two Blue Dragon Badges and three hundred Xiantian Pills on the body.\u201cTsk, tsk, this guy is indeed one of the top ten geniuses, such a fortune\u2026\u201dQin Nan took a deep breath and claimed possession of the two Blue Dragon Badges and Xiantian Pills, placing them in his chest pocket.Qin Nan did not stay any longer; he carried the corpse on his body and disappeared into the woods with a leap.\u2026Meanwhile, at the lake where the Three Petal Golden Lily was\u2026The Blood Barrier Mist on the lake started to vanish, revealing the true appearance of the lake.Despite that, no one was focusing on the changes to the lake; everyone was staring at the woods while chatting with each other.\u201cNow that the time it takes for an incense to burn has passed, I assume the battle between them too has come to an end.\u201d\u201cHAHAHA, in my opinion, even though Qin Nan would not be killed by Childe Gloomy Rage, he would be severely injured, barely surviving from the battle.\u201d\u201cHeh, who asked him to be so cocky? He dared to hunt Childe Gloomy Rage down by himself, such recklessness. Even if he did survive, he would be close to dying!\u201d\u201cHmph, I don\u2019t think so. Childe Gloomy Rage was ranked fourth among the top ten geniuses\u2014he would easily eliminate Qin Nan.\u201d\u201cI bet Qin Nan is dead for sure!\u201d\\n\u2026\u2026These disciples were so excited that they even started to organize bets, guessing whether Qin Nan had been severely injured or killed.In their opinions, Qin Nan was so full of himself even when his cultivation was only at the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm; his ending would surely be miserable.On the other hand, after hearing the disciples\u2019 discussions, Chu Yun\u2019s pretty face turned dark, with a growing glint of worry in her eyes.She continued to pray in her heart for Qin Nan; even if Qin Nan was severely injured, it was better than him dying.As for Xiao Leng standing beside her, even though he was slightly worried, he was not nervous at all.This was because previously at the cave, he had experienced the enormous pressure emitted from Qin Nan\u2019s body; hence, he was confident that Qin Nan held a powerful trump card\u2014even if he were defeated, he would surely survive.All of a sudden, one of the disciples who possessed better senses yelled out, \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming\u2026\u201dAfter the yell, the whole place fell silent, and the atmosphere grew tenser.Xiao Leng, Chu Yun, and all the disciples raised their heads almost at the same time, glancing at the woods.In their view, a figure was slowly approaching them from the woods\u2026\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.After a long moment, Xiao Leng was the first to gather his thoughts, although a stunned expression could still be seen in his eyes. He said with a trembling voice, \u201cQin Nan\u2026 Childe Gloomy Rage\u2026 are\u2026 are you the one who killed him?\u201dQin Nan calmly gazed at him and said, \u201cWhy? Is it strange?\u201dIs it strange?It\u2019s absolutely unbelievable!Xiao Leng gulped down his saliva; even though he was the only one among all the disciples to know Qin Nan would have some kind of trump card, he did not expect the famous Childe Gloomy Rage to be killed by Qin Nan, a weaker seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator.\\nDoes this mean that Qin Nan\u2019s strength had reached a certain higher level?At this moment, the disciples finally recovered from the shock; they all took a cold breath in.At this moment, their views of Qin Nan had totally changed; they now looked at him with a hint of respect, as if they were looking at a king, with no intention to offend him.If even the powerful Childe Gloomy Rage was slain, what gave them the right to be cocky before Qin Nan?Meanwhile, Qin Nan glanced at the crowd of new disciples and as a sudden thought came to him, said calmly, \u201cI know that most of you guys are working together with Ling Zixiao to hunt me down. Besides that, I also know that you were all mocking me when I was battling against Childe Gloomy Rage\u2026\u201dThese words caused all the disciples\u2019 hearts to twist suddenly.What was Qin Nan trying to say? Was he planning to hurt them all?Qin Nan\u2019s eyes turned cold as he said, \u201cI\u2019m quite a vengeful person; I\u2019ll give you all a chance, either leave this place right now, or prepare to fight me!\u201dEveryone was stunned upon hearing these words; following it\u2014as if their death penalties had just been waived\u2014the scene turned messy as the disciples all rapidly fled from the scene without hesitation, executing the movement techniques they learned.In just a short period of time, none of the over twenty new disciples decided to stay.Qin Nan\u2019s brief words had caused the crowd of disciples to flee desperately for their lives.This was a stately warning.This was also the reason that Qin Nan carried Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s corpse all the way back.Everyone knew that in the Martial world, most of the Martial Artists had the tendency to throw their weight around, especially toward the weaker ones. Due to the conflict between Qin Nan and Ling Zixiao, he had offended all the disciples previously; since they were too many enemies to handle\u2014and it was impossible to slain them all one by one\u2014Qin Nan decided to give them a warning using Childe Gloomy Rage\u2019s corpse.\\nFor example, these twenty plus disciples would not dare to offend Qin Nan after today.\u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan.\u201d At that moment, Chu Yun\u2014who was initially immersed in a great shock\u2014started speaking; her eyes were flickering, as if her eyes had drips of water, and her voice was soothing, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so powerful; even Childe Gloomy Rage was mismatched against you. You have concealed so much, it worries me.\u201dUpon seeing Chu Yun\u2019s attractiveness, Qin Nan\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he coughed, and said in a serious tone, \u201cSenior Sister Chu Yun, if I dare to chase him down on my own, it means I am confident in my own strength.\u201dChu Yun nodded her head and said gently, \u201cYou\u2019re right. It was my fault for having too little faith in you.\u201dThese words were Chu Yun being honest.She indeed had little hope in Qin Nan previously.She missed an important hint; if Senior Brother Gong Yang was so fond of Qin Nan, how would Qin Nan easily be defeated?\u201cSenior Sister Chu Yun, since you\u2019re quite close with Brother Yang, there\u2019s no need to be so polite with me.\u201d Qin Nan took a quick glimpse at Chu Yun\u2019s physique, as he said, \u201cIf Senior Sister Chu Yun don\u2019t mind, you can come with us to search for the Three Petal Golden Lily.\u201dAfter hearing the words, Chu Yun could not help but let out a sigh of relief.The Three Petal Golden Lily was incredibly precious; she was worried that Qin Nan planned to take exclusive possession of it, as it was obvious that she was totally unmatched against Qin Nan\u2019s strength.\u201cThank you, Junior Brother Qin Nan.\u201d Chu Yun giggled charmingly and said, \u201cBy the way, don\u2019t refer me as Senior Sister, just call me Sister Yun.\u201d\\n\u201cUh, sure, Sister Yun.\u201d Qin Nan let out a wry smile; he was not stupid, and he was able to sense Chu Yun kind of had the intention to seduce him secretly.However, Qin Nan had little experience of this kind of stuff; thus, he had no idea how to deal with it.At that instant, Xiao Leng who was left aside exclaimed suddenly, \u201cThe Blood Barrier Mist is gone!\u201dUpon hearing this, Qin Nan and Chu Yun were slightly stunned and glanced forward.The Blood Barrier Mist encapsulating the lake was being sucked away by an unknown force, which caused the mist to take the shape of a dragon and fly toward the woods in the distance. The true appearance of the lake was finally revealed.A huge lake appeared before the three.The whole lake was perfectly clear; colorful fish could be seen swimming around in the water. The surface of the lake was covered by a thin layer of Qi, as if the lake was made of Qi.In the middle of the lake was a cave; at the entrance to the cave, a lily emitting a golden light could be seen swaying in the wind; the light was eye-catching, as if it was a celestial lily.After seeing this, the three took a cold breath; there was no doubt this stalk of lily before them was the precious Three Petal Golden Lily!Despite the lily being in front of them, the three had no intention to move instantly.According to their prediction, the Blood Barrier Mist would be gone in two days\u2019 time\u2026 but at that instant, only half a day had passed since they arrived.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After receiving the Qi from the petal of Golden Lily, his blood became excited, flowing around in his body like a small river.Even though he had not achieved the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, his body\u2019s strength had now reached the peak of seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm; ordinary cultivators of the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm were no match against him.\u201cThe Body Tempering Realm is split into ten layers, which refers to the tempering of the flesh, the joints, the organs, and the blood. After consuming the petal of Golden Lily, my blood starts to be tempered, flowing rapidly like a river. If I continue to cultivate, improving my blood circulation to rumble like an ocean, I would then level up to the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm.Qin Nan had his eyes opened wide, with an assured expression in his eyes; he had understood clearly the path of his cultivation.Despite that, Qin Nan was not in a rush to improve his cultivation right now.The most precious thing about the Three Petal Golden Lily was the effect it had on one\u2019s Martial Art comprehension, instead of cultivation.\u201cHere it is, the true benefit of the Three Petal Golden Lily\u2026\u201dQin Nan inhaled deeply and closed his eyes, forcing his thoughts to become calm.At that instant, the Perfection Stage Saber Intent of One with the Saber was unleashed from Qin Nan\u2019s body into the surroundings, causing the cave to be encapsulated in an icy aura.\\nMeanwhile, the arcane force of the Three Petal Golden Lily was released; it turned into a mysterious stream which flowed toward Qin Nan\u2019s brain and entered his thoughts.\u201cSo this is what makes the Three Petal Golden Lily special?\u201dQin Nan felt astonishment in his mind; he began to feel the Martial World before him was turning brighter and more spacious. All the doubts he had once had in his mind were all solved with ease.For example, if the Martial World was a barrier, after consuming the petal of Golden Lily, Qin Nan managed to break through this barrier and find himself arriving in a new world.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this Three Petal Golden Lily to be so beneficial; no wonder it\u2019s so valuable. I should make use of the time now to comprehend, and maybe I could have a breakthrough of the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber\u2014to have a grasp of the legendary Arcane Realm\u201dFollowing it, Qin Nan calmed himself down once again and immersed himself into the state of One with the Mind.After he turned into the state of a Martial Addict, a figure appeared in Qin Nan\u2019s mind; the figure had a saber in his hand as he danced around executing Saber Arts, which switched alternatively between the Thundercrash Saber Art and the Hundred Steps Soaring Saber. The figure revealed the greatest secrets of these two Saber Arts.The figure was Qin Nan\u2019s comprehension of Martial Arts; it was a reflection of him mastering the Saber Arts.Meanwhile, a blurry figure slowly appeared behind Qin Nan.The Divine Battle Spirit had been unleashed on its own.After it appeared, the figure dancing Saber Arts in Qin Nan\u2019s mind started to execute the Mystical Eight Steps; he even executed different unknown Sword Arts, Fist Arts and Palm Arts, revealing countless secrets of the different abilities.\\nAt that moment, QIn Nan completely immersed in the Martial Skill presentation of the figure in his mind; he had entered an arcane state.Five days had passed; Chu Yun and Xiao Leng had awoken from their cultivation.Powerful auras could be felt from both Xiao Leng and Chu Yun\u2019s bodies; their cultivation had greatly improved.Especially Xiao Leng, whose cultivation had achieved the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, and had also mastered the Minor Success Stage of One with the Sword, increasing his battle power.Chu Yun withdrew her aura and glanced at the inner part of the cave before saying in a low tone, \u201cHow long does Junior Brother Qin Nan need before coming out from seclusion?\u201dXiao Leng gave her a look as he instinctively thought of the experience he had when Qin Nan came out last time; he shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Let\u2019s not disturb him.\u201dHowever, at that instant, a terrifying aura could be felt coming from the inner part of the cave.At that instant, Xiao Leng and Chu Yun\u2019s expressions changed incredibly.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Despite that, their hearts still shivered after being exposed to this terrifying aura, as if countless sabers had penetrated their bodies, causing them to tremble.After a while, the terrifying aura finally vanished, returning a calm state to the area. Chu Yun and Xiao Leng simultaneously let out sighs of relief.The two immediately glanced toward the inner cave as they collected their thoughts. At that moment, Qin Nan walked out slowly.Even though Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation was still at the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm, it seemed like his aura had completely disappeared, as if he had turned into an ordinary person.Both Chu Yun and Xiao Leng, as members of the top ten geniuses, were quite knowledgeable. They knew the ordinary aura from Qin Nan did not mean he had lost his power, but rather that it indicated the breakthrough, or level up, that he had just experienced.Chu Yun was the first to speak, \u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, could it be that you have surpassed the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber? Did you manage to reach the legendary Arcane Realm?\u201dXiao Leng, who was standing beside her, was stunned hearing the words.Regarding the realms of the Martial World, the realm above One with the Weapon was called the Arcane Realm.Rumors said that once a person had reached the Arcane Realm, it would bring incredible power, granting the person the ability to kill stronger opponents with ease.Did Qin Nan reach the Arcane Realm just by consuming a petal of the Golden Lily?\u201cNope.\u201d Qin Nan shook his head and smilingly said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to reach the Arcane Realm; you guys are overestimating my progress.\u201d\\nAfter hearing these words, Chu Yun and Xiao Leng exchanged gazes; they both felt suspicious.If Qin Nan did not reach the Arcane Realm, how could he emit such a terrifying aura?They could only assume that Qin Nan was not willing to reveal too many of his secrets.The fact was that Chu Yun and Xiao Leng had misunderstood. Qin Nan did not reach the Arcane Realm. After raising his comprehension by consuming the petal of Golden Lily and unleashing the Divine Battle Spirit, he managed to visualize the Martial Skills himself in his mind to reveal the secrets of the abilities; he had only achieved a half-arcane state, still a distance away from reaching the Arcane Realm.In other words, Qin Nan had reached a barrier; if he were able to break through this barrier, he would then achieve the Arcane Realm.Chu Yun shook her head and decided not to pursue the question; she switched the topic as she asked in a soft tone, \u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, where should we go now? There are only ten days left until the conclusion of the Trials of Versatility.\u201dAfter hearing these words, Qin Nan straightened his face.Now that his cultivation had reached the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm, together with his half-arcane state, he had the strength to slay cultivators of the ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm. Apart from the super geniuses like Huang Long and Ling Zixiao, or those with a cultivation base of tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm, Qin Nan was able to eliminate anyone.Since he was strong enough now, it was time to search for the Blue Dragon Badges.Previously after killing Gloomy Rage Childe, he had obtained two Blue Dragon Badges, which meant Qin Nan now possessed a total of three Blue Dragon Badges.These three Blue Dragon Badges provided him with a great chance to achieve the top ten ranks, but it was nowhere enough to reach the top three spots.\\nAfter a brief moment of thinking, Qin Nan said in a low tone, \u201cNow is the time to find those Blue Dragon Badges; I\u2019ve got a piece of a map on me. If we can find the other four pieces, the twenty Blue Dragon Badges would be ours\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have a map?\u201d Chu Yun was slightly surprised, before she frowned her eyebrows and said, \u201cThe Island of Versatility is a thousand miles big. How are we going to locate the remaining four pieces? Besides that, they might have already been taken by the others.\u201dXiao Leng nodded his head in agreement; it was quite difficult to collect all five pieces of the map.Qin Nan did realize the problem, but there was no better way at the moment to find the other four pieces of the map.However, all of a sudden, a cold voice was heard, \u201cWho among you three is Qin Nan?\u201dAt that instant, Qin Nan, Chu Yun, and Xiao Leng changed their expressions; they instantly gathered their might and prepared for a battle.Qin Nan was slightly surprised too; with his current cultivation, even Ling Zixiao would not be able to approach without him noticing.The three turned around at the same time and looked in the direction of the voice.At the entrance of the cave stood an old man. He was wearing a ragged robe made of cloth; wrinkles like blade scars could be seen on his face due to his age, giving him an icy aura.At that instant, the three were staggered; they did not expect to find an old man on the Island of Versatility.The Island of Versatility was used exclusively as a training ground for the disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect; the Transportation Portal was the only way to get here, unless one\u2019s cultivation had surpassed the Martial Emperor Realm, which allowed the person to penetrate the Poison Mist around the Island of Versatility and reach the island safely.\\nUpon having this thought, the three\u2019s expressions changed again. Did that mean this old man\u2019s cultivation had surpassed the Martial Emperor Realm?Qin Nan took a deep breath; using his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, he could tell that this old man was no ordinary person. His strength was on par with Old Shan\u2019s.Qin Nan forced himself to restrain his doubts and brought his fists together, \u201cElderly mister, I\u2019m Qin Nan. Is there any problem?\u201d\u201cCome away with me.\u201d The mysterious old man said calmly, \u201cAs for your two friends, they can wait here.\u201dXiao Leng and Chu Yun glanced toward Qin Nan immediately; what does this powerful, mysterious old man want from Qin Nan?Qin Nan was slightly stunned, before shaking his head while saying, \u201cElderly Mister, forgive my impoliteness. I have never met you before, and I have no clue where you came from, so I will not follow you.\u201dXiao Leng and Chu Yun were shocked; they never thought Qin Nan dared to reject facing such a powerful presence.The mysterious old man squinted his eyes; at that instant, the atmosphere in the surroundings condensed, as an imperious pressure was unleashed.Xiao Leng and Chu Yun\u2019s faces were twisted; Being exposed to such pressure, they felt like they had turned into ants, which could be trampled to death at any time.Qin Nan\u2019s body turned tense due to the pressure. Even his flowing blood began to condense; despite that, his expression remained unchanged.He clearly knew that if the old man were here to kill him, he would have done it before, killing all three of them in a single blow. However, the old man did not do so, which indicated he was here for some other reasons; thus, he would not kill them easily.\\nThis was why Qin Nan would ask the old man for his identity.The mysterious old man remained stationary for a while, before withdrawing his aura and saying in a calm tone, \u201cYou\u2019re smart, but it\u2019s wiser if you don\u2019t reject me next time; those who rejected me are all dead. Besides that, I know you have Junior Brother Shan\u2019s badge on you.\u201dAfter hearing the words, Qin Nan hesitated momentarily, before an astonished expression appeared on his face.Junior Brother Shan\u2019s badge?This mysterious old man is calling Old Shan\u2014the great elder\u2014his Junior Brother? Does that mean this old man is Old Shan\u2019s Senior Brother?The great elder\u2019s Senior Brother, how powerful could this man be?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I didn\u2019t know you were Old Shan\u2019s Senior Brother. Please forgive me.\u201dQin Nan was respectful toward Old Shan.It was because when he shattered Old Shan\u2019s Ocean Crescent Boulder to pieces, instead of asking him for compensation, Old Shan kindly gave him an incredibly precious Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge.The mysterious old man nodded his head without any expression; he waved his hand, causing two ancient books to appear. He then said with a calm tone, \u201cYou two, wait here. You can spend some time on these two books.\u201dFollowing this, the mysterious old man glanced toward Qin Nan and said, \u201cCome with me.\u201dQin Nan nodded his head without hesitation; he gave Chu Yun and Xiao Leng a glance before following behind the old man.Chu Yun and Xiao Leng remained rooted on the spot and looked incredulously at the two disappearing figures.They were yet to react to the situation as they failed to understand what was going on.Who is this mysterious old man? Who is Old Shan? What relationship exists between Qin Nan and him?At that instant, their gazes instinctively dropped to the books on the ground.With a glance, amazed expressions appeared on Chu Yun and Xiao Leng\u2019s faces; Xiao Leng even exclaimed in a shocked tone, \u201cMartial Emperor\u2019s Cultivation Notes? Two of them?\u201dAfter recovering from the shock, the two took deep breaths.They clearly knew that the value of cultivation notes written by Martial Emperor cultivators was extremely precious.Such precious things, and the mysterious old man had just given it to them like throwing rubbish?At that moment, Chu Yun and Xiao Leng realized that the mysterious old man must possess an extraordinary background.\\nChu Yun picked up one of the books, and a wry smile appeared on her elegant face; she said while shaking her head, \u201cI\u2019m afraid Junior Brother Qin Nan is the only one I don\u2019t understand among the new disciples.\u201dChu Yun said this with full honesty.At the beginning\u2014due to Senior Brother Gong Yang\u2019s request\u2014Chu Yun was curious about Qin Nan, but she did not see him as someone important, as she felt Qin Nan was too full of himself; he ended up astonishing her by killing Childe Gloomy Rage, who was ranked fourth among the top ten geniuses. Together with the mysterious old man from moments ago, it seemed like there were too many secrets surrounding Qin Nan.\u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, one day, I\u2019ll discover all your secrets.\u201d Chu Yun thought to herself; her eyes were glistened, as if they were filled with water. She then cleared her thoughts and entered the cave with Xiao Leng, preparing to cultivate.As they had just received precious Cultivation Notes from a Martial Emperor expert, they were not willing to waste any more time.\u2026\u2026Qin Nan followed the mysterious old man through the woods for a while, before arriving at a hill with plenty of space.The mysterious old man stopped in his track and turned around. He looked at Qin Nan and calmly said, \u201cI know you have a lot of questions, but there\u2019s no need to ask \u2018em. Even if you asked, I would not answer. You only need to follow my orders; if I\u2019m satisfied, I\u2019ll give an incredible opportunity to you.\u201dQin Nan was slightly stunned; he did not expect the old man to say this.On the journey here, he had a lot of queries, like the name of this mysterious old man, and the reason he came looking for him, etc.\\nIf he were not willing to say, Qin Nan would not ask, so he then said, \u201cElderly Mister, what should I do?\u201dQin Nan was quite doubtful; he was only a seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator. Normally, he could only provide very little help to this mysterious old man.So what could possibly be the reason this old man came to look for me? What does the incredible opportunity mean?The mysterious old man gave him a glance and said, \u201cBefore that, there\u2019s a question I want to ask you. Your Martial Spirit\u2014it was only eighth-grade Huang ranked, how did it become ninth-grade Huang ranked?\u201dAfter hearing the words, Qin Nan straightened his face, and his eyes turned cold, \u201cElderly Mister, were you stalking me?\u201dQin Nan had only unleashed his ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit when he was battling against Childe Gloomy Rage; he had never revealed it before.If the mysterious old man knew his Martial Spirit grade, the only explanation was, he was being followed.\u201cOf course.\u201d The mysterious old man nodded and said, \u201cI did follow you; I was the one who made the Blood Barrier Mist vanish earlier than scheduled too.\u201dQin Nan was stunned; he took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down and said, \u201cElderly Mister, I\u2019m only a seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator, why are you so interested in me?\u201dThe words were said in an interrogating tone.The Divine Battle Spirit was the greatest secret Qin Nan possessed; he would not allow anyone to know it.The mysterious old man\u2019s face turned cold as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about your secrets; I was only curious. The reason I followed you was that your Martial Skill Talent was able to shatter the Ocean Crescent Boulder into pieces. Through my observation, you have yet to disappoint me, achieving the half-arcane state with just a petal of the Golden Lily. Your Martial Skill Talent is impressive indeed.\u201d\\nAfter hearing these words, Qin Nan was slightly shocked. He did not expect the mysterious old man to approach him because of his Martial Skill Talent.Qin Nan then reminded himself that Old Shan had given him a precious Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge due to his Martial Skill Talent. It was quite reasonable now for this mysterious old man\u2014Old Shan\u2019s Senior Brother\u2014to be interested in his Martial Skill Talent too.The coldness in Qin Nan\u2019s heart diminished as he said, \u201cI see. I can only tell you that I was struck by lightning when I was young. Through it, I received a hidden technique which is able to conceal my Martial Spirit\u2019s rank. Previously, my Martial Spirit appeared to be eighth-grade Huang ranked, because I had concealed its true rank. Besides that, I hope that you will stop stalking me from today onwards.\u201dThe mysterious old man was not suspicious of these words; he said in a cold tone, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. If you clear my doubts today, I will not follow you anymore.\u201dAfter saying this, the old man waved his hand, and a huge boulder appeared out of nowhere.The boulder instantly grabbed Qin Nan\u2019s attention.The boulder was five meters tall; it was completely violet, like a violet ocean. A full white moon could be seen in the middle of the boulder. An arcane force could be felt from the full moon, giving a sensational feeling.Qin Nan inspected the boulder, and was instantly doubtful, \u201cThis boulder seems similar to the Ocean Crescent Boulder?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The old man said calmly, \u201cThis boulder\u2019s name is the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder, which is the enhanced version of the Ocean Crescent Boulder. As you know, it has the ability to detect one\u2019s Martial Skill Talent. The only difference is, to activate this boulder, one\u2019s Martial Talent must have at least triggered the Violet light of the Ocean Crescent Boulder.\u201d\\n\u201cTriggering the Violet light?\u201dQin Nan was slightly stunned; the grades of the Ocean Crescent Boulder were red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, and the Ocean Crescent rare occurrence\u2014a total of eight grades.Violet light was almost the highest grade of the boulder.Even Ling Zixiao, with his ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and excellent talent, was only able to trigger the indigo light.In contrast, the starting point of this Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder before him, was violet light, which meant that if Ling Zixiao were here, he would not even qualify to activate this Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder.Qin Nan took a deep breath and calmed himself down quickly, before saying, \u201cElderly Mister, what do you want me to do\u2014feel free to say it.\u201dAfter hearing Qin Nan\u2019s words, in the mysterious old man\u2019s cold eyes, an undetectable flame was ignited.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you are able to trigger the black light, I will give you ten thousand Xiantian Pills. Trigger the dominator light, and I\u2019ll give you a unique equipment. Trigger the emperor light, and I\u2019ll give you a unique equipment in addition to a badge that could save your life.\u201dThe old man hesitated for a brief moment, before continuing, \u201cIf you trigger the Violet Ocean Full Moon rare occurrence, I\u2019ll accept you as my introductory disciple.\u201dAfter hearing the words, Qin Nan was completely stunned, with an utter shock in his eyes.He did not expect the old man to be so generous; ten thousand Xiantian Pills just for triggering the black light, not to mention the great benefits for triggering the dominator or emperor lights, and the Violet Ocean Full Moon rare occurrence.This time, Qin Nan\u2019s mind went blank for a while, unable to recover in a short period of time.The mysterious old man remained expressionless. He stood aside in silence, awaiting Qin Nan\u2019s reply.After a long moment, Qin Nan collected his thoughts and inhaled deeply before saying, \u201cElderly Mister, are you sure?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d The old man replied calmly, \u201cI always keep my words.\u201dQin Nan let out a long breath; there was no reason to reject such tremendous benefits, but a sudden thought came to him as he asked instinctively, \u201cElderly Mister, I have a question. What if I end up shattering this Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder into pieces\u2026 Would you ask me for compensation?\u201dThe shattering of the Ocean Crescent Boulder was still having an impact on Qin Nan\u2019s mind.\\nFurthermore, the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder before him was even more precious than the Ocean Crescent Boulder; if this old man really demanded compensation, there was no way Qin Nan could afford it.\u201cYou think you could?\u201d The old man glimpsed at Qin Nan and said with a grin, \u201cDo you think the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder is comparable to the Ocean Crescent Boulder? That being said, if you were to shatter the boulder, I\u2019d teach you a secret technique. Don\u2019t you worry, this hidden technique is far more precious than any pills or equipment.\u201dAfter saying this, the old man was seemingly unaffected; he did not take Qin Nan\u2019s words seriously.Shatter the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder? What a joke.Qin Nan let out a sigh of relief and said, \u201cIf you said so, I\u2019d accept your challenge.\u201dFollowing it, Qin Nan shut his eyes to calm his thoughts, before taking a big step forward and reached out his right hand, touching the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder.It seemed like the time froze at that moment.Following it, a blinding violet light was seen emitting from the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder; it had a precious feeling to it.After seeing this, the old man said calmly, \u201cViolet light, natural Martial Addict. Now, unleash your Martial Spirit; I know that your Martial Spirit is able to boost your Martial Skill Talent.\u201dQin Nan nodded his head, and without further ado, nine golden rays were emitted together with a blurry human figure behind him, floating in the air.As soon as the Divine Battle Spirit appeared, the previously calm Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder began to vibrate vigorously.The bright violet light from the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder changed rapidly, turning into dazzling golden light; with the golden light, a powerful imperious aura could be felt, as if an emperor had arrived.\\nUpon seeing this sight, the old man\u2019s eyes flickered as he said, \u201cWell done, emperor light; I\u2019ll give you a piece of unique equipment.\u201dAfter saying this, the old man glanced at Qin Nan with a hint of disdain.Trying to shatter the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder?You didn\u2019t even trigger the Violet Ocean Full Moon rare occurrence, but still aimed to shatter the boulder?Pathetic, whimsical.However, a rare occurrence took place at that instant.The huge Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder began to vibrate, as if a great force was gathered, ready to burst out.The sudden change caused the old man\u2019s expression to stiffen, \u201cIs this\u2026\u201dFollowing it, countless rays were fired toward the sky from the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder, forming a vast violet ocean. A full moon was seen floating on the surface of the violet ocean; the whole scenery felt like the revelation of an ancient drawing.The old man could not help but exclaim, \u201cViolet Ocean Full Moon rare occurrence?\u201dAs soon as he finished the sentence, another shocking scene took place.The Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder vibrated even more vigorously; the scenery from the rare occurrence began to vibrate. Following it, a loud \u2018BANG\u2019 was heard. The Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder had exploded, firing pieces of it to the surroundings.Upon seeing this, the mysterious old man was completely shocked.Qin Nan collected his thoughts immediately; he was not surprised at all after seeing this, as he calmly withdrew the Divine Battle Spirit.The scene before him was not out of Qin Nan\u2019s expectation.The Divine Battle Spirit had arrived from ancient times with the heavenly thunder; not only could its Martial Spirit grade be improved, it could also evolve, granting the bearer secret techniques, enhancing the bearer\u2019s body. The secrets it held, were unending.\\nHow could the potential of this Divine Battle Spirit be easily inspected by a mere Violet Ocean Full Moon Crescent?Pathetic, Whimsical!Qin Nan glimpsed at the old man, as he felt sorry for him. He ended up shattering the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder into pieces despite the benefits the old man promised; he said in an apologetic tone, \u201cElderly Mister, I\u2019m sorry; I still ended up breaking your boulder accidentally\u2026\u201dThe mysterious old man recovered from the shock; despite his cold nature, he could not help but chuckle on the spot.Breaking the boulder accidentally?This is the Violet Ocean Full Moon Boulder, who in this continent could break it accidentally?The mysterious old man soon calmed down, and his coldness reappeared, as he said, \u201cEven though your Martial Spirit is only ninth-grade Huang ranked, it\u2019s indeed impressive to boost your Martial Skill Talent in such way. Now that you\u2019ve broken the boulder into pieces, I\u2019ll fulfill my promise by teaching you a secret technique. This technique\u2019s name is Heavenly Accumulating Strike\u2014it\u2019s extraordinary. You should familiarize yourself with the technique before I demonstrate it to you.\u201dAfter saying this, the old man took an ancient book out and shoved it toward Qin Nan.\u201cHeavenly Accumulating Strike? Such a domineering name.\u201dQin Nan thought to himself upon receiving the book, as a hint of joy appeared in his eyes. A secret technique well regarded by the mysterious old man would surely be something fascinating. Hence, he could not wait to start reading the content.However, what Qin Nan did not expect was that when he was immersed in learning the secret technique, a great sense of joy appeared in the old man\u2019s cold eyes which were staring at Qin Nan\u2019s figure.This was the first time the old man was so joyful in the past three hundred years!\\n\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Knowing the basics of the technique was his limit, as the secrets withheld by it were far from reach with his current cultivation.\u201cThis Heavenly Accumulating Strike is indeed overwhelming.\u201d Qin Nan opened his eyes slowly, with a complicated expression in them. He said, \u201cBut even though the beginning of the book is presented domineeringly, the content at the back is nowhere near the accumulation of the oceans, the mountains, and the living, neither the Heavens nor Earth. It\u2019s not enough.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan displayed a disappointed expression.Qin Nan was immediately attracted by the imperious feeling of the Heavenly Accumulating Strike at the start of the learning process, causing him to have a high hope in it. However, after grasping the basics of it, he realized that the power of this Heavenly Accumulating Strike was only 0.1%\u2014or maybe even 0.01%\u2014of what was described in the introductory chapter.It felt like this technique was just a prototype, with countless flaws.At that instant, the old man\u2019s cold voice was heard, \u201cYoung lad, this Heavenly Accumulating Strike, is only a fragment of the book I found coincidentally; despite that, do you know how many Martial Artists desire it?\u201d\u201cA fragment?\u201d Qin Nan understood after hearing this. He then ignored the sarcastic comment from the old man and switched the topic, \u201cElderly Mister, why are you still here?\u201dIt took him five days just to get a sneak peak of the Heavenly Accumulating Strike, and this mysterious old man with terrifying strength waited on him this whole time?\\nThe old man glanced at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m a man of my word. I gave you this book of Heavenly Accumulating Strike, but I knew you could only grasp the basics of it. I\u2019ll now demonstrate the technique once. As for how much you could learn from it, is none of my business.\u201d\u201cDemonstrate once?\u201d Qin Nan was stunned, before exclaiming joyfully, \u201cThanks, Elderly Mister!\u201dQin Nan was excited; this mysterious old man before him possessed incredible cultivation; watching his demonstration was far more precious than reading all those cultivation notes of Martial Emperor cultivators. The secrets and knowledge revealed through his demonstration would be extremely useful toward the understanding of the Martial Skill.\u201cHeavenly Accumulating Strike!\u201dThe old man did not waste any more time; he waved his hand, and a gigantic arm about ten meters long appeared. Following this, an arcane force could be felt from the arm, absorbing the Qi from the Heaven and Earth.At that instant, the gigantic arm began to shrink, before eventually turning into a dot of light about the size of a thumb.The old man then flicked the dot of light, firing it into the ground three miles ahead.Following this, a loud rumbling noise could be heard all of a sudden; a devastating light appeared from the ground three miles ahead, as if a huge ball of lightning descended from the Heavens and detonated.Suddenly, all the land within a mile from the explosion was destroyed\u2014not a single trace of life could be seen.Qin Nan\u2019s mind went blank after witnessing this.He did not expect a dot of light the size of a thumb would unleash such devastating force.With this force, even Martial Emperor experts would be destroyed without leaving a single trace, right?After going blank for a moment, Qin Nan slowly collected his thoughts. At that instant, he clenched his teeth and used all his focus to restrain the shock and astonishment in his heart, and sat down while unleashing the Divine Battle Spirit; he soon entered a state of One with the Mind and became lost in his own world.\\nIn Qin Nan\u2019s mind, the attack of the mysterious old man kept repeating.A gigantic arm, floating in the air, accumulating Qi from the Heaven and Earth, which then turned into a dot of light the size of a thumb\u2026Qin Nan remained sitting with his legs crossed and interpreted the looping scene in his thoughts; no matter if it was hailing storm or broad sunlight, his figure remained stationary, as he was fully immersed in the learning process of the skill.When the night came, Qin Nan finally opened his eyes.At that moment, he comprehended it.Initially, after consuming the petal of the Golden Lily, he had achieved the half-arcane state. After witnessing the demonstration of the mysterious old man, plus the fact that he fully immersed himself in learning the skill for a whole day, he had finally broken through the barrier.His comprehension skyrocketed, bringing him into the Arcane Realm.BANG\uff01With a loud noise, endless streams of Perfection Stage Saber Intent were emitted from Qin Nan\u2019s body. Following it, the Saber Intent changed significantly; the Saber Intent began to clump together, compress and condense, forming the blurry outline of a saber.The saber contained all of Qin Nan\u2019s Saber Intent.This was the Arcane Realm; his might and his comprehension transformed arcanely into a single dot, without wasting any energy.After seeing this, the mysterious old man nodded his head.Qin Nan took a deep breath to hold back his joy while he withdrew the Saber Intent into his body, before saying in a low tone, \u201cElderly Mister, thank you for your advice; I truly appreciate it.\u201dThese were honest words from Qin Nan.The demonstration from the old man was not only about the Heavenly Accumulating Strike; it also showed him the Arcane State, explaining it thoroughly so that Qin Nan would witness himself the secrets of the Arcane Realm.\\nWith this, Qin Nan was able to succeed in breaking through the barrier and stepped into the Arcane Realm.The old man had put a lot of effort in teaching Qin Nan with this single demonstration.\u201cSilence, I have fulfilled my promise. You can leave now.\u201d The old man glanced at him and said, while waving his hand calmly.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Qin Nan was going to ask some questions, but he did not expect the mysterious old man to ask him to leave at once. He shook his head helplessly and said, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll excuse myself.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan inhaled deeply, and gave the old man three deep bows before leaving the place.The mysterious old man stood at the peak of the hill, staring at Qin Nan\u2019s disappearing figure. After half an hour, the cold expression on his face vanished, and was replaced by a burst of laughter, \u201cHAHAHAHA, you won\u2019t believe I have managed to find such a talent at last! Three hundred years, it has been three hundred years. God has finally given me a chance, the chance I have waited for so long!\u201dThe laughter felt like a clap of thunder, which shattered the entire hill into pieces.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was now way stronger than even someone like Childe Gloomy Rage.As for Xiao Leng, with the help of the Martial Emperor\u2019s cultivation notes, his comprehension of One with the Weapon greatly improved.However, Chu Yun and Xiao Leng were astonished when they saw Qin Nan.They could feel that even though Qin Nan\u2019s aura was nothing different from an ordinary person\u2019s, there was a nearly undetectable imperious pressure from him, causing the two of them to feel uneasy.They could tell that Qin Nan\u2019s strength had greatly improved over the past six days.Having this thought, Chu Yun and Xiao Leng were curious about one thing, What actually happened in these six days between Qin Nan and the mysterious old man?\u201cOnly four days left.\u201d Qin Nan did not waste any time and went straight to the main topic; he said in a deep tone, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find the Blue Dragon Badges. Now that our strength has greatly improved, we could split up to increase our chances of finding those Blue Dragon Badges.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan felt a sense of helplessness.Although he planned to achieve the top three in this Trials of Versatility, he only possessed a piece of the map, which was not enough to find the twenty hidden Blue Dragon Badges.\\nIn other words, his current overwhelming power was not very useful at this moment.Upon hearing these words, Chu Yun and Xiao Leng tried not to chuckle as Chu Yun spoke first with her pleasant voice, \u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, you probably don\u2019t know yet, but something epic happened over the past six days when you left. It seems like it would force us three to work together again.\u201dQin Nan was stunned after hearing this, before glancing confusedly at Xiao Leng.Xiao Leng withdrew his smile and took out a letter made of animal hide from his waist, and said, \u201cBrother Nan, have a look at this letter.\u201dQin Nan took the letter and opened it; following it, his expression changed slightly.On the letter wrote, \u201cMy name is Xiao Yunhe. I\u2019m writing this letter on Senior Brother Ling Zixiao\u2019s request. As we all know, only when the five pieces of map are combined together could remaining twenty Blue Dragon Badges be found. Currently, Senior Brother Ling Zixiao has two of the pieces, which means there are three pieces remaining. Therefore, I\u2019m informing all disciples, if the map bearers are willing to bring the pieces to the center of the island, they will be given great rewards. As for the Blue Dragon Badges, all are welcomed to compete fairly.\u201d\u201cHow did you guys receive this letter? And who is this Xiao Yunhe?\u201d Qin Nan took a deep breath before asking the questions.This cave we are in is quite hidden from outside; ordinary disciples would never discover it. What kind of sorcery does Xiao Yunhe have to send the letter here?And from the letter, it seems like this Xiao Yunhe had distributed this letter to all the disciples.The Island of Versatility is a thousand mile huge, with the disciples spawning at random locations. How did Xiao Yunhe deliver this letter to every single disciple?\\nXiao Leng answered immediately, \u201cWe received this letter two days ago. This Xiao Yunhe was ranked first among the top ten geniuses. His cultivation has reached the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm. Not only that, his Martial Spirit has the ability to control low-level monsters. Apparently, he distributed the letters to every cultivator on the Island of Versatility by controlling monsters which are known as \u2018Flaming Pigeons\u2019.\u201cControlling the monsters?\u201d Qin Nan understood straight away after hearing this, and could not help but exclaim, \u201cThe world is indeed fascinating, with all kinds of surprises. There exists a variety of Martial Spirits with countless different capabilities.\u201dQin Nan was greatly surprised by this.Even though the ability to control low-level monsters was not seemingly useful, if Xiao Yunhe did not possess this ability, even Xiantian Realm experts would not have been able to distribute the letter to all the disciples.Chu Yun nodded her head, before a serious expression appeared on her face, \u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, this is good news and bad news at the same time. The good news is, now that Xiao Yunhe has informed all the cultivators to gather, the five map pieces would surely come together and reveal the locations of the last twenty Blue Dragon Badges. The bad news is that it seems like Xiao Yunhe is now Ling Zixiao\u2019s subordinate. Not only that, if Ling Zixiao dares to \u2018invite\u2019 all the disciples on the Trials of Versatility, it means that he is not worried even if all the disciples gather together.\u201dThe words thoroughly analyzed the current situation.After saying this, Chu Yun turned around with flickering eyes and said, \u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, it\u2019s your decision. Should we go?\u201dUpon hearing this, Xiao Leng instinctively glanced at Qin Nan too.Every disciple would know of the conflict between Qin Nan and Ling Zixiao, not to mention Ling Zixiao had teamed up with two hundred and twenty new disciples to hunt Qin Nan down previously at the White Jade Dojo.\\nIf Qin Nan were to accept the invitation and go to the center of the island, apart from facing Ling Zixiao, he would also be facing the huge group of cultivators that Ling Zixiao had gathered.Even Xiantian Realm experts would choose not to face the group and would reject the invitation.In other words, in the current situation, it would be like a death sentence if Qin Nan chose to attend with the invitation.\u201cYes, why not?\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s expression was calm, as if he did not realize the danger awaiting him. He said in a calm tone, \u201cAt the start of these Trials of Versatility, I had decided to at least achieve the top three spots. It is impossible to get into the top three with the three badges I have now; therefore, the only chance is to compete for the remaining twenty Blue Dragon Badges.\u201dChu Yun and Xiao Leng glanced at each other, and could see a wry expression in each other\u2019s eyes.It seemed like they both had already anticipated that Qin Nan would surely accept the invitation.Chu Yun inhaled deeply to get rid of her thoughts and said, \u201cIf Junior Brother Qin Nan has decided to go, then I\u2019m willing to offer some assistance.\u201dXiao Leng nodded his head in agreement. He had long regarded Qin Nan as his leader; hence, he was willing to follow him too.Qin Nan glanced at the two and took a deep breath, before saying in a serious tone, \u201cI appreciate the friendship between us. You have my thanks. However, if things are getting out of hand and your safety is endangered, leave immediately and don\u2019t worry about me. Is that clear?\u201dChu Yun and Xiao Leng both nodded their heads after hearing these words.\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d Qin Nan was straightforward, and without wasting any more time, started to pack up for the departure.\\nHowever, at that moment, Chu Yun could not help but ask, \u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, why would you still go after knowing that a lot of enemies would be there? Aren\u2019t you scared?\u201dQin Nan looked at her calmly and smilingly said, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? So what if it\u2019s a sea of flame or a cliff of great height? Should I allow Ling Zixiao and the disciples to continue bullying me like that? If I don\u2019t show them my stance, they would probably assume I\u2019m like an ant, ready to be crushed at any time.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan\u2019s expression turned stone cold, emitting an icy murderous intention.He had never been a forgiving person.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let\u2019s see who\u2019s here beforehand.\u201dChu Yun and Xiao Leng nodded their head while they withdrew their aura. With their current cultivation, even a tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm expert would have a hard time detecting their presence.Following this, Qin Nan\u2019s group of three entered the valley.As soon as they arrived, they saw many disciples standing in the valley chatting with each other.At a rough estimation, it seemed like over two hundred disciples were gathered in the valley.Qin Nan\u2019s group of three hid among the two hundred plus disciples, and remained low-key. No one had identified who they were.\u201cLing Zixiao really came prepared. Many geniuses have teamed up with him.\u201d Chu Yun said with a low voice as soon as they entered the valley, an unpleasant expression on her face.Ling Zixiao could be spotted among the two hundred plus disciples; he was wearing a fancy robe, and with a smile on his face, it gave him a gentlemanly appearance. He was like a gleaming star as the focus of everyone at the scene.Besides that, the aura emitting from Ling Zixiao\u2019s body was that of the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm\u2014incredibly powerful.Furthermore, the most eye-catching thing was that there were around fifty talented disciples standing behind Ling Zixiao, with impressive cultivation bases; the lowest grade was the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm, while the highest had also reached the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm.\\nIt was obvious that Ling Zixiao had convinced these disciples to be his subordinates.On the other side were those who preferred to be alone, or disciples who had formed their own groups.Even though these disciples added up to give a count of over one hundred and sixty, they were still too weak standing before Ling Zixiao\u2019s terrifying team; the difference between them was like fireflies competing against the stars of the galaxies\u2014uncomparable.Xiao Leng quickly glanced around, and his expression changed instantly, as he said, \u201cThat guy is Xiao Yunhe. He really is following Ling Zixiao now.\u201dAfter hearing this, Qin Nan followed Xiao Leng\u2019s gaze and discovered a prideful young man standing behind Ling Zixiao; this young man was different than Ling Zixiao, who had no intention of concealing his aura and proudly presented his cultivation of the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm.This man was the one who gathered all the disciples by controlling the monsters, the first rank among the top ten geniuses: Xiao Yunhe.At that moment, Chu Yun inhaled deeply and said, \u201cI never expected even Duan Muyang, third among the top ten geniuses, and Wang Chu and Luo Jianhao, sixth and seventh among the top ten geniuses, would all have submitted themselves to Ling Zixiao.\u201dQin Nan squinted his eyes and straightened his face after hearing these words.He quickly scanned the group of people gathered around Ling Zixiao, and immediately discovered three young men with powerful auras emitting from their bodies; Duan Muyang\u2014who was ranked third among the top ten geniuses\u2014had reached the ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm.As for Wang Chu and Luo Jianhao\u2014they both reached the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm.Including Xiao Yunhe, there were now four among the top ten geniuses who had submitted themselves to Ling Zixiao.Even if Ling Zixiao did not recruit the fifty disciples, with the help of these four geniuses, no one among the disciples at the scene would dare to oppose and go against him.\\nAt that instant, Chu Yun and Xiao Leng\u2019s hearts dropped heavily.Despite the fact that they\u2019d predicted Ling Zixiao would come prepared facing all the disciples, they did not expect him to bring such a terrifying force.The two instinctively glanced at Qin Nan.Qin Nan\u2019s expression remained calm as always, as he said in a low voice, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to talk now. Let\u2019s wait quietly here, and eavesdrop on their conversation to gather some intel.\u201dUpon hearing this, Chu Yun and Xiao Leng could not help but let out a wry smile. From his words, they could tell that Qin Nan had no intention of retreating even after witnessing the terrifying group that Ling Zixiao had assembled.Following this, the two nodded their heads helplessly and kept quiet.Meanwhile, many disciples had arrived from all directions. In less than an hour\u2019s time, the number of disciples in the valley had reached around two hundred and sixty. Almost every single newly recruited disciple of the Mystic Spirit Sect had arrived.With these many disciples\u2014these many geniuses\u2014it was definitely going to be an exciting gathering for all the warriors, with intense competition.The valley turned noisy as the disciples began to chat with each other.\u201cTsk, tsk. This Ling Zixiao is indeed impressive. He subdued Xiao Yunhe and gathered all the disciples on the Trial of Versatility here with his Martial Spirit.\u201cHehe, gathering all the disciples is not the most impressive thing about Ling Zixiao. Take a look at the disciples behind him. Four of the top ten geniuses, and the others are all incredibly talented, with cultivation reaching the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm\u2026\u201d\u201cI agree with your words, brother. With such an incredible and terrifying force like what Ling Zixiao has assembled, even Huang Long would not dare to compete with him.\u201d\\n\u201cAy? Who cares about it? Does anyone know how many pieces Ling Zixiao has gotten his hands on?\u201d\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, he has gathered four pieces of the map, with the last one remaining.\u201d\u201cOnly one remaining? It looks like the final showdown of the Trial of Versatility will be starting soon. We\u2019ll soon know who is the first ranked of this Trial of Versatility.\u201d\u2026\u2026After hearing the discussions among the disciples, Qin Nan began to understand the current situation.Four pieces of the map have been collected, so the one I have is the final piece?In the meantime, one of the disciples mentioned Qin Nan; \u201cEh, do you guys think that trashy Qin Nan would be here?\u201d\u201cHAHAHA, are you talking nonsense? Of course that trash would not dare to come here, do you still think we are at the White Jade Dojo?\u201d\u201cHeh, you are right. That guy dares to be so smug at the White Jade Dojo only because of the sect rules prohibiting battles among the disciples. If he dares to come here today, I\u2019m afraid Senior Brother Ling Zixiao\u2019s troops would crush him into pieces.\u201d\u201cHehe, you forgot something too; Senior Brother Ling Zixiao\u2019s troop was not the only one planning to kill that trashy Qin Nan. There are many disciples\u2014including me\u2014who have the same thoughts too. If Qin Nan dares to come, I will be the first one to slay him.\u201d\u2026\u2026After hearing the comments, Chu Yun and Xiao Leng instinctively glanced at Qin Nan, smilingly in a weird way.It seems like these disciples still think Qin Nan was just a fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm trash. How could they know this Qin Nan they are talking about had recently slain Childe Gloomy Rage, the fourth-ranked among the top ten geniuses?\\nQin Nan gave a calm smile without saying anything. He secretly took note of the appearances of these disciples.However, at that instant, a disciple who was few meters away from Qin Nan\u2019s group of three glimpsed them unintentionally. He was stunned for a moment, before rubbing his eyes and looking again. He then said in an unbelieving tone, \u201cYou\u2019re Qin Nan? You dared to come?\u201dAlthough his voice was not loud, it was like an incredibly sudden strike of thunder happened among the chitchat of the disciples.At that moment, the whole place went quiet as if death had descended, bringing an abnormal silence.Everyone immediately looked in Qin Nan\u2019s direction, with doubtful expressions appearing in their eyes.Qin Nan is here?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He really came.\u201d\u201cThis guy is so ballsy; he dares to come even when he knew all the disciples, including Senior Brother Ling Zixiao, would be here.\u201d\u201cImpressive. I\u2019m totally impressed this time. Who among the disciples could be more arrogant than this Qin Nan?\u201d\u201cIn terms of arrogance I\u2019m afraid Qin Nan is considered the most arrogant one among us. He dares to come here facing such terrifying enemies.\u201d\u201cTsk, tsk, did you guys realize? Qin Nan\u2019s cultivation has achieved the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm. Does he really think he stands a chance against Senior Brother Ling Zixiao with his current strength?\u201d\u201cHAHAHAHA, what a joke. A cultivation base of the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm; he wouldn\u2019t even achieve the top fifty spots among the new disciples.\u201d\u2026\u2026While immersed in the shock, the disciples did not forget to mock Qin Nan, as if he was never worth mentioning in their eyes.It was because\u2014in their eyes\u2014there was no difference between Qin Nan and a dead man.Who would think Qin Nan has a chance to survive against Senior Brother Ling Zixiao, the geniuses behind him, and all the disciples?\u201cShut the f**k up!\u201d At that instant, Xiao Leng ran out of patience facing the disdainful comments from the disciples, as he furiously said, \u201cYou guys keep scolding Brother Nan as trash, why don\u2019t you look for yourself? If you\u2019re brave enough, come out here and I\u2019ll keep you company for the time being.\u201dBeside Xiao Leng, Chu Yun also let out an attractive smile and said, \u201cIf anyone wants to hurt Junior Brother Qin Nan, I\u2019m more than willing to be your opponent.\u201d\\nAs Xiao Leng and Chu Yun voiced out, the exploding crowd immediately went silent.The disciples stared at them with eyes opened wide and faces filled with disbelieving expressions. They never expected Xiao Leng and Chu Yun\u2014ranked respectively tenth and fifth among the top ten geniuses\u2014to side with Qin Nan and voice out.Aren\u2019t Xiao Leng and Chu Yun afraid their actions would cause Ling Zixiao to be angry toward them?At that instant, a seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator said in a low voice, \u201cGuys, I\u2019m afraid you should all mind your words. If you guys didn\u2019t know, even though Qin Nan only possessed a cultivation of the seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm, he has mastered the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber; he even eliminated Childe Gloomy Rage who was ranked fourth among the top ten geniuses.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s right; I saw that too with my own eyes.\u201d\u201cI was there too; Qin Nan defeated Childe Gloomy Rage by himself.\u201dThe disciples who were there competing for the Three-Petalled Golden Lily all shared what they had witnessed as a warning to the remaining disciples.After hearing these words, they looked at Qin Nan with faces filled with great astonishment once more.It was unbelievable for them that Qin Nan had mastered the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber, and slain the fourth rank of the top ten geniuses, Childe Gloomy Rage, merely with his seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation.Such strength; does that mean Qin Nan\u2019s strength could now be considered close to the third rank of the top ten geniuses?Not to mention, now that Xiao Leng and Chu Yun\u2014these two geniuses\u2014had teamed up with Qin Nan, it resulted in an intimidating formation.\u201cOh? Interesting.\u201d The one speaking at this moment was none other than the main focus of the crowd, Ling Zixiao. He glanced at Qin Nan smilingly and said, \u201cI never expected this trash to master the Perfection Stage of One with the Saber, and manage to kill Childe Gloomy Rage; maybe you do have some capability.\u201d\\nLing Zixiao appeared to be reasonable, as if Qin Nan was never his enemy.The truth was, the moment Ling Zixiao saw Qin Nan, a great sense of joy was felt in his heart, but he soon calmed himself down. With my current strength, and my powerful troops, how difficult would it be to crush this trashy Qin Nan?Therefore, in Ling Zixiao\u2019s opinion, Qin Nan was already a dead man.There was no need to panic dealing with a dead man. In fact, he was quite interested to know what was Qin Nan thinking, to accept the invitation.After Ling Zixiao finished speaking, the crowd who fell silent moments ago was enlivened again.in Nan and kill him.\u201cHuh? So what if Qin Nan did kill Childe Gloomy Rage? Senior Brother Ling Zixiao alone is enough to slay him.\u201d\u201cHeh, that\u2019s right. So what if this Qin Nan really is a genius? He has no idea what awaits him after offending Senior Brother Ling Zixiao.\u201d\u201cHumph, a single word from Senior Brother Ling Zixiao, and I would definitely fight Q\u201d\u201cCount me in!\u201d\u2026\u2026These disciples were the ones previously recruited by Ling Zixiao at the White Jade Dojo. They could not wait to suck his balls by mocking Qin Nan, so Ling Zixiao would be fond of them.Qin Nan seemed like he did not hear the comments from the disciples; he glanced calmly at Ling Zixiao and said, \u201cAren\u2019t you the one who understand my capabilities the most?\u201dThe atmosphere of the place turned icy cold with the words.Especially the group of geniuses behind Ling Zixiao, who all stared at Qin Nan in disbelief with wide open eyes.They clearly knew what Qin Nan was referring to\u2014the Martial Talent Battle at the Skill Library, in which Ling Zixiao had lost to Qin Nan, prohibiting him from entering the Skill Library for the rest of his life.\\nWhere did Qin Nan receive his courage from to say such thing in this current situation?Isn\u2019t him afraid of enraging Ling Zixiao?Ling Zixiao\u2019s face contorted slightly, as a cold murderous intent appeared in his eyes. Before he could speak, Xiao Yunhe, who stood behind Ling Zixiao, let out a disdainful laugh.Xiao Yunhe took a big step forward, unleashing his tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm aura and stared at Qin Nan scornfully, as he said, \u201cWho gave you, a piece of trash, the right to talk to Senior Brother Ling Zixiao like that? If you\u2019re so brave, fight me; I\u2019ll make sure you are granted a quick death!\u201dAt that moment, Xiao Yunhe\u2019s revealed his imperiousness, threatening to kill Qin Nan with his first sentence.The crowd was excited upon seeing this.Who was Xiao Yunhe?The first ranked among the top ten geniuses, with his cultivation achieving the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm, the ultimate genius who had gathered them all here with his impressive ability to control monsters.Even if Qin Nan was quite talented, and able to defeat Childe Gloomy Rage, he had no chance of standing against Xiao Yunhe\u2014death was the only possible outcome.All the disciples\u2019 faces were filled with disdainful expressions.They could not wait to see if Qin Nan\u2014who had been so full of himself all this time\u2014was willing to accept the challenge.In the meantime, under the spotlight of the crowd, Qin Nan calmly smiled and slowly took out a piece of map from his chest pocket and said, \u201cSorry, my main focus now is to retrieve the locations of the remaining twenty Blue Dragon Badges. I won\u2019t be able to battle you.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan hesitated momentarily before saying, \u201cThat being said, I\u2019m not afraid of you. It\u2019s just that you are not qualified enough to fight me.\u201d\\nThe words landed like huge explosions!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Patience.\u201d Ling Zixiao advised him, before stepping forward while setting his eyes on the map in Qin Nan\u2019s hand, \u201cYou\u2019re the last person I expected to retrieve a piece of the map. Now, if you agree to hand over the map, I\u2019ll only beat you into a cripple, and spare your life.\u201dAfter hearing the words, every disciple including Xiao Yunhe realized what was going on.The reason Ling Zixiao stopped Xiao Yunhe was because Qin Nan had the final piece of the map.Qin Nan glanced at Ling Zixiao and said, \u201cCalling me trash all the time, and now threatening to beat me into a cripple, sparing my life? Do you really think I will hand it over? In your dreams, Ling Zixiao.\u201dLing Zixiao\u2019s face twisted slightly after hearing this, but he could only hold back his anger at this moment.\\nHe only had four of the pieces on him; without Qin Nan\u2019s final piece, it would be impossible to find the remaining twenty badges.Ling Zixiao took a deep breath and tried his best to talk in a calm tone, \u201cI apologize for my previous words. If you\u2019re willing to give me the map piece, I swear I will not touch you. How is it this time?\u201dQin Nan let out a hollow laugh and said, \u201cI have zero trust in you. Besides, I don\u2019t need your mercy either.\u201dQin Nan paused briefly before saying calmly, \u201cLing Zixiao, if you really want the remaining twenty Blue Dragon Badges, then give me the four pieces you have. If not, I will never give the final piece to you, even if I am forced to destroy it.\u201dEveryone\u2019s face twisted after hearing this.They finally learned the true meaning of being \u2018conceited\u2019 and \u2018scornful\u2019.Who among the new disciples would dare to talk to Ling Zixiao like that?Ling Zixiao\u2019s expression turned cold instantly and he yelled, \u201cQin Nan, you don\u2019t want to push me past my limit.\u201dHowever, before Qin Nan had the chance to speak, a terrifying aura appeared all of a sudden, together with a mocking laugh, \u201cLing Zixiao, you\u2019re such a hypocrite; you called him trash, threatened to beat him into a cripple, and now you\u2019re telling him not to push you off the top?\u201dThe sudden voice had attracted everyone\u2019s attention, who all turned around toward it.With a glance, everyone\u2019s expression immediately changed, including Ling Zixiao\u2019s.The newcomer was none other than Huang Long, who was one of the super geniuses.Qin Nan directed his vision toward Huang Long, and was soon startled.He could feel a ferocious aura emitting from Huang Long\u2019s body; this aura could even outmatch Ling Zixiao, whose cultivation had achieved the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm.\\n\u201cThis aura\u2014even though it\u2019s still a distance away from the Xiantian Realm, it\u2019s definitely stronger than the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm. It seems like Huang Long had set half his foot into the Xiantian Realm, not to mention that he had also mastered the Perfection Stage of One with the Weapon\u2026\u201d Qin Nan exclaimed in his mind, as his expression turned serious.In his opinion, Huang Long was a tougher opponent to deal with than Ling Zixiao.Ling Zixiao\u2019s face turned cold instantly. If someone were to ask him who was the person he hated the most, Qin Nan and Huang Long would both rank first in his mind, not to mention the fact that Huang Long served as a much greater threat to him. This was also the reason that Ling Zixiao had gathered other geniuses like Xiao Yunhe and Duan Muyang; to combine their strengths to handle Huang Long when the time came.\u201cHuang Long, what are you trying to say?\u201d Ling Zixiao snapped.\u201cWhat am I trying to say?\u201d Huang Long smilingly ignored his hostile gaze and said in a lazy tone, \u201cI do have a suggestion here. Brother Qin Nan will give you the map so that you can find the remaining twenty Blue Dragon Badges. During this period, you are prohibited to attack Brother Qin Nan. If not, I will see it as you disrespecting me. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll be teaming up with Brother Qin Nan, and eliminate every single piece of trash like you all.\u201dAfter saying this, Huang Long glanced at Qin Nan and said smilingly, \u201cBrother Qin Nan, don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m a man of my words. If this hypocrite Ling Zixiao dares to attack you, I\u2019ll help you handle them.\u201dLing Zixiao and the others had unpleasant expressions on their faces after they heard this. It felt like Huang Long was scolding them with every word he said.\\nHowever, they did not have anything to comment, as his suggestion was indeed the best way to deal with the current situation.The only downside for Ling Zixiao and his crew was that it seemed like they could only kill Qin Nan after retrieving the Blue Dragon Badges, which meant this trash could still live on for a couple more days.\u201cI definitely trust Senior Brother Huang Long\u2019s words.\u201dQin Nan did not hesitate; he immediately took the map out and shoved it toward Ling Zixiao.Although he was not willing to hand over the map, it was not wise for the situation to remain as it was. Furthermore, Qin Nan was quite fond of Huang Long\u2019s personality, which was why he agreed to hand it over so easily.After seeing Qin Nan\u2019s swift decision, the faces of Ling Zixiao and the other geniuses instinctively twisted once again.\u201cHeh, Brother Qin Nan, I admire your open-mindedness.\u201d Huang Long raised his thumb at Qin Nan and said laughingly, \u201cLing Zixiao, stop wasting time and join the map pieces together now.\u201dLing Zixiao let out a cold \u2018hmph\u2019 without refuting. He took the remaining four pieces from his chest pocket and joined them all together.The crowd remained silent while watching the event taking place; even though they were quite disappointed that Ling Zixiao and Qin Nan did not end up battling each other, they would not dare to speak since the main concern now was the twenty Blue Dragon Badges, in addition to the presence of a super genius like Huang Long at the scene.As Ling Zixiao connected the five map pieces together, something bizarre happened.The five map pieces bursted into flames all of a sudden.Following this, light rays were emitted from the flames and joined together continuously, forming a map which could be easily understood.\\nAt the center of the illuminated map, was an image of a Blue Dragon\u2019s head. It was eye-catching as it had a lively feeling to it.Upon seeing this, everyone\u2019s breath intensified as they tried their best to memorize the details of the map in their minds.After a while, the virtual map completely vanished and turned into ashes.Qin Nan reacted immediately as he gave out a command: \u201cLet\u2019s move!\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, they all followed the people in front who took off moments ago.At that moment, if one were to look down from above, that person would see lots of people rushing forward at a crazy speed, like an avalanche.Even the monsters with eighth-layer and ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivations immediately fled for their lives after seeing the crowd, unlike their normal ferocious appearance.In just a brief moment, the woods shook vigorously, and the ground trembled tremendously; the whole place was knocked out of order.The location shown on the virtual map was not too far away; in just a while, the crowd had all arrived at the destination.However, when the disciples saw the sight before them, everyone\u2019s eyes were filled with astonishment.Before them, a huge bamboo woods had appeared, with no sign of ending, like a sea of bamboos. Furthermore, every single bamboo was dark blue, with a wide circumference, like giant trees firing up into the sky. The bamboo leaves had an ancient and arcane feeling to them, as if they had experienced the vicissitudes of life.One could easily tell that the bamboo woods were nothing ordinary.Qin Nan quickly collected his thoughts and unleashed his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit to carefully inspect what was inside the bamboo woods.\\nHowever, something strange occurred; among the mysterious bamboo woods existed an arcane force, completely blocking Qin Nan\u2019s view to take a look at what was inside.This caused Qin Nan to frown his eyebrows; it was the first time his vision had been prohibited while using the Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit.Meanwhile, Ling Zixiao took a while observing the mysterious bamboo woods before him, before he let out a cry, \u201cCould this be the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods?\u201dHis words immediately grabbed the attention of the crowd.Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods? What the f**k is that?In that instant, a voice with a complementing tone was heard, \u201cThat\u2019s right. This Junior Brother is indeed wise, to know this bamboo woods to be the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods.\u201dThe sudden voice caused the crowd to feel uneasy, including both Huang Long and Ling Zixiao.Seconds later, a young man walked out from the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods at a slow pace. The young man wore a white robe, and his skin tone was pale, and this together with his sharp eyebrows, gave him a handsome appearance.Furthermore, the aura emitted from the young man was terrifying, and unfathomable.\u201cMartial Emperor expert?\u201dQin Nan squinted his eyes slightly; this young man who appeared out of nowhere possessed a cultivation of Martial Emperor, even though it was slightly weaker than Xiao Qingxue\u2019s.The young man walked out from the woods, and glanced at the crowd before he smilingly said, \u201cTo all Junior Disciples, my name is Xu Qian. I\u2019m your Senior Brother. I was given the order from the five elders to come to this Island of Versatility specifically to test you all. Those who pass the test, will receive a certain amount of Blue Dragon Badges depending on their results.\u201d\\nAfter hearing the words, the disciples came to a realization.It seemed like the sect had long prepared this surprise, which served as the final test for the disciples.\u201cPardon me, may I ask what the test is about?\u201d Ling Zixiao stepped forward and asked in a respectful tone.Xu Qian glanced at him before saying with a smile, \u201cYou must be Junior Brother Ling Zixiao right? The elders have mentioned you before; a super genius with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, great potential. After the trials, if you have any queries about cultivation, feel free to look for me.\u201dAfter hearing the words, a hint of jealousy could be seen in the eyes of the other disciples.Despite that, they would not dare to offend either side at that moment\u2014they could only wait for the final test.Ling Zixiao answered in a humble tone, \u201cIt is my pleasure.\u201dXu Qian was quite satisfied with the humble attitude he presented; he then turned around facing the crowd and said, \u201cAllow me to explain. The Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods is considered a precious material. Every bamboo here possesses the ability to seduce your thoughts. This seduction only works for cultivators below the Martial Emperor Realm. In other words, this test is simply to test your will and determination toward Martial Arts.\u201dUpon saying this, the smile on Xu Qian\u2019s face disappeared as he continued, \u201cThe upcoming test is conducted by entering the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods. The rules are simple; there are only two of them. Firstly, no Martial Skill is allowed within the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, but you are allowed to unleash your Martial Spirits. Secondly, the test will be focusing on the amount of steps you take forward. One would need a thousand step to pass through this Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods. The results of the test are based on the ranking according to the amount of steps taken.\u201d\\nXu Qian then paused for a moment, allowing the crowd to digest the information.After a long period, Xu Qian spoke again, \u201cNow I\u2019ll talk about the rewards. At the end of the test, the third ranked will receive one Blue Dragon Badge; the second, four Blue Dragon Badges; and the first will receive fifteen Blue Dragon Badges. That being said, if any of you are able to finish all one thousand steps, you will be given all the Blue Dragon Badges. Keep in mind that no one from the Mystic Spirit Sect has ever finished the one thousand steps; if any of you achieved that, you would be heavily rewarded by the sect.\u201dAfter hearing these words, the eyes of the disciples were ignited by flames of desire.It was clear from Xu Qian\u2019s words that this test was not about their cultivation base; it was more like a competition of their Martial Heart, which was relatively fair.In other words, even a disciple with a mere cultivation of the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm had a chance to obtain the twenty Blue Dragon Badges if his Martial Heart was firm enough to finish the one thousand steps.Even if no one could finish the one thousand steps, the first place alone would receive fifteen Blue Dragon Badges, guaranteeing the first place in the Trial of Versatility!However, Qin Nan, Huang Long, Ling Zixiao and the others remained calm compared to the excited disciples. They all felt like Xu Qian had yet to finish his explanation.As they expected, Xu Qian after seeing the excitement on the disciples\u2019 faces, calmly said, \u201cBy the way, I forgot to mention. If your will of Martial Arts is not solid enough, there is a chance your cultivation could go into a state of madness, causing your body to explode. In previous Trials of Versatility, there were quite an amount of geniuses who had achieved the eighth-layer and ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm who ended up dying here\u2026\u201d\\nAfter saying this, Xu Qian let out a cold grin before saying, \u201cSo, who\u2019s first?\u201dThe whole crowd became completely stationary, and a dead silence enveloped them!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With his seventh-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, he is considered a genius too.\u201d\u201cWang Hu? So he is Wang Hu? I\u2019ve heard that many disciples have died by his hands.\u201d\u2026\u2026At that instant, everyone\u2019s focus was gathered onto Wang Hu\u2019s figure.As Wang Hu entered the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods with firm determination, he proceeded forward rapidly without any sign of slowing down. However, as he reached his two hundred steps, he let out a cry of pain, before his whole body was flung back to the entrance of the woods as if he was struck by an incredible force.\u201cThis Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, is indeed extraordinary.\u201dWang Hu said pantingly; even though his strength was weakened, his gaze appeared to be relatively excited, as if he just learned something new.Xu Qian glanced over Wang Hu and said, \u201cNot bad, I\u2019m impressed with your bravery. Here are one hundred Xiantian Pills, they are yours.\u201d\\nAfter saying this, Xu Qian waved his hand, and a jade jar flew out from his sleeves and landed before Wang Hu.Wang Hu was slightly startled looking at the jade jar before him, before being immersed in great joy and said, \u201cThank you Senior Brother, thank you so much!\u201dEveryone was stunned after seeing this; they did not expect Xu Qian to reward Wang Hu with one hundred Xiantian Pills.These were one hundred Xiantian Pills, which were equivalent to ten thousand Body Tempering Pills; it was quite a fortune.\u201cI\u2019ll go next!\u201dAt that instant, another seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm disciple among the crowd ran out of patience, and their figure vanished into the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods with a flash.Following this, many disciples began to execute their movement techniques and went into the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods.As a result. the whole place became lively at this moment.On the other hand, Qin Nan, Huang Long, Ling Zixiao and the other geniuses remained in place, surverying the scene calmly.Time passed gradually; an hour eventually passed after this.In a single hour, there were fifty-eight disciples who entered the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods; the one leading was still Wang Hu, who had advanced forward two hundred steps. Besides that, there were eight disciples who had fallen within this period, and among them, the highest cultivation base was eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm.The deaths of the eight people had caused the lively scene to immediately cool down; the disciples were hesitant whether or not they should take the test.At that moment, a hollow laugh could be heard, \u201cHey Qin Nan you trash, look carefully. I\u2019ll teach you the meaning of a real genius!\u201dThe one speaking was none other than Xiao Yunhe.His entry grabbed the attention of the crowd; a hint of anticipation could be seen in their eyes.\\nXiao Yunhe, the first ranked among the top ten geniuses. How far could he advance in these Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods?As Xiao Yunhe entered the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, the aura of his tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation burst out from his body; he did not move forward like Wang Hu, but took it slowly as if he was taking a stroll in the park, one step at a time.After the period of time it took an incense to burn, the whole crowd was astonished, as Xiao Yunhe had advanced four hundred steps forward\u2014double the amount of Wang Hu\u2019s.At that same time, Xiao Yuhne let out a huge roar, and eight golden rays could be seen appearing behind him, together with a Martial Spirit which resembled an ancient-looking container.After unleashing his Martial Spirit, Xiao Yunhe\u2019s speed greatly increased, like an arrow fired from a bow. He dashed forward ninety-nine steps, before his movement came to a half, and he backed out rapidly from the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods.At that instant, the whole crowd was dumbfounded.They never expected Xiao Yuhne to be able to take four hundred ninety-nine steps, which was equivalent to half of the complete journey.Xu Qian slightly raised his head, and said with a complementing gaze, \u201cNot bad, here are three hundred Xiantian Pills for you.\u201dUnder countless jealous glances, Xiao Yunhe received the three hundred Xiantian Pills politely, before looking disdainfully at Qin Nan\u2019s group.Meanwhile, three figures sprang forward from Ling Zixiao\u2019s group.The figures were Duan Muyang, Wang Chu, and Luo Jianhao, who were all considered part of the top ten geniuses.Duan Muyang was not in a rush to enter the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods; instead, he approached Qin Nan and his group, and gave Chu Yun and Xiao Leng a disappointed glance before saying, \u201dSenior Sister Chu Yun, Junior Brother Xiao Leng, it\u2019s unwise that you two have chosen to follow this trash; I\u2019m afraid you will regret your decision very soon.\u201d\\nWang Chu and Luo Jianhao were more straightforward with their scornful looks, as if they were laughing mockingly at Chu Yun and Xiao Leng\u2019s choice.After saying this, the three of them turned around and vanished into the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods with a flash.Under the high anticipation of everyone, their results were soon made known.Duan Muyang advanced four hundred and fifty steps.Wang Chu advanced four hundred and forty steps.Luo Jianhao advanced four hundred steps,At that instant, Duang Muyang, Wang Chu, and Luo Jianhao immediately became the focus of the crowd.After receiving the rewards from Xu Qian, they approached Qin Nan\u2019s group again, but did not say a single word; they glanced at them scornfully, before heading back to their group.It was silently mocking, silently disapproving.Chu Yun and Xiao Leng\u2019s expressions turned cold at that instant.Even though Qin Nan remained silent, anyone would be furious after being continuously mocked.However, a deafening laugh was heard suddenly, \u201cHAHAHA, these four scrubs dare to be so prideful with their results nowhere close to being significant. Let me teach those four scrubs the true definition of a Martial Heart.\u201dThe one speaking, was none other than Huang Long.The previously prideful Xiao Yunhe, Duan Muyang, Wang Chu, and Luo Jianhao had their expressions turn unpleasant after hearing these words.They initially planned to mock and treat Qin Nan and his group disdainfully, to influence their Martial Heart. They did not expect Huang Long to interfere straightaway, by scolding them as \u2018scrubs\u2019 smugly.\u201cHuang Long, mind your words. The Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods is not testing one\u2019s cultivation base, but one\u2019s Martial Heart.\u201d All of a sudden, Ling Zixiao\u2014who was previously silent\u2014began to speak. He took a big step forward, emitting Battle Intent from his body, and said, \u201cNow I would like to see, in terms of Martial Heart, whose one among us two is stronger, and firmer.\u201d\\nAt that moment, every disciple had their eyes wide open, their hearts beating fast; even their breaths halted.These two super geniuses were finally going to compete directly?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These two super geniuses, Huang Long and Ling Zixiao, were finally going to compete with each other.Even though these two were not having a duel with their cultivation, a duel of Martial Heart was quite precious to see too, causing the crowd to be excited.At last, the atmosphere\u2014which was frozen for a moment\u2014exploded as the whole place was covered in noisy discussions. Every disciple was incredibly excited, causing their faces to blush.\u201cOh my god, Huang Long and Ling Zixiao are going to compete with each other. I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a month!\u201d\u201cHAHAHA, I would place my bets on Senior Brother Huang Long, he will surely win.\u201d\u201cHehe, Senior Brother Huang Long was too fast-tempered, his Martial Heart is surely unsteady. On the other hand, Senior Brother Ling Zixiao has the appearance of a gentleman, and is polite to the people around him. This is the sign of a firm Martial Heart.\u201d\u201cPfft, your interpretation is definitely a joke.\u201d\u201cShut the f**k up guys! Those two were both super geniuses; who gave some trash like you the right to comment here?\u201d\u2026\u2026Meanwhile, Xu Qian\u2014who was an inner disciple that achieved the Martial Emperor Realm\u2014was quite interested in the duel too. This was because a duel between two super geniuses with ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirits was considered a rare sight for him too. He smilingly said, \u201cThe duel between the duo, what a rare sight. As a Senior Brother, I\u2019m willing to contribute a thousand Xiantian Pills as the prize. The winner of the duel is free to take these one thousand Xiantian Pills.\u201d\\nXu Qian\u2019s words caused the scene to explode once again.A thousand Xiantian Pills, was considered a great fortune.\u201cThanks, Senior Brother!\u201dHuang Long and Ling Zixiao gave Xu Qian a respectful bow, before exchanging glares filled with lusts for battle and murderous intents.The two\u2014almost at the same time\u2014emitted extremely powerful auras, before their two figures turned blurry as they vanished into the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods.\u201dThe noisy crowd fell silent immediately; everyone held their breaths looking at the scene before them.As Huang Long and Ling Zixiao entered the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, they immediately displayed the reason why they were considered super geniuses; they sprang forward like two enraged beasts among the bamboo woods at an incredible speed.A hundred steps!Two hundred steps!Three hundred steps!In just a brief moment, Huang Long and Ling Zixiao both were on their five hundredth steps; even after surpassing the results of Xiao Yunhe and the others, they continued to advance forward with no sign of slowing down.At that instant, every disciple felt their hearts almost reach their throats, as they clenched their fists tightly, feeling extremely thrilled.A period of ten breaths had passed, and Huang Long and Ling Zixiao had achieved eight hundred steps!It was at this moment that the two began to slow down their speed as they continued to proceed forward.As they reached eight hundred and fifty steps, they both came to a stop and let out a deafening roar; nine golden rays suddenly appeared behind them, with a murderous sword behind one, and a flute encapsulated in flames behind the other.The two had unleashed their Martial Spirits at the same time!Despite that, the force of the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods was at last evident; even after unleashing their ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirits, both Huang Long and Ling Zixiao were advancing forward with a speed slower than a person walking, like an old man walking slowly, or a man running out of energy carrying a huge boulder on his back.\\nAs the two lashed out their eight hundred and ninety-ninth step, a furious roar was heard from the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, and a figure was sent flying out from the woods.The figure was none other than Huang Long.At that instant, Huang Long\u2019s face appeared to be pale white and his strength greatly weakened. He no longer had the imperious appearance of a super genius, but it seemed like he was severely injured.However, meanwhile, in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, continuous sounds of a flute could be heard, forming a pleasant melody. At the same time, Ling Zixiao leapt out on his final step, which summed up to a total of nine hundred steps!The whole crowd fell quiet as everyone received a huge blast to their minds.Nine hundred steps!Ling Zixiao had achieved nine hundred steps!The winner of the duel between these two super geniuses is Ling Zixiao?\u201cHAHAHA.\u201d Ling Zixiao\u2019s figure slowly floated out from the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, with a forceful aura and a prideful expression like an emperor sitting on top of his throne; he glanced disdainfully at Huang Long not far from him and said, \u201cHuang Long, see this? You\u2019re mismatched against me; your Martial Heart is nowhere close to mine. Remember what happened today, as you\u2019re no longer my opponent after today!\u201dAfter hearing this, Huang Long\u2019s expression greatly changed, as his aura further weakened.Ling Zixiao words served as a sharp blade, penetrating into Huang Long\u2019s heart and planting a nightmare inside it.At this moment, the crowd finally burst into an uproar after they collected their thoughts.\u201cHAHAHA, Senior Brother Ling Zixiao won!\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Ling Zixiao is the best! He is ranked first among the new disciples!\u201d\u201cSo terrifying, even Senior Brother Huang Long is mismatched against him. It seems like Senior Brother Ling Zixiao is the king of the new disciples!\u201d\\n\u2026\u2026At that instant, every disciple was extremely excited; their glances toward Ling Zixiao were no longer filled with mere respect, but endless worship.Those geniuses who submitted themselves to Ling Zixiao, like Xiao Yunhe, were enlivened too, who all burst out laughing joyfully. As Ling Zixiao had defeated Huang Long, it also meant that they would receive tremendous benefits by following Senior Brother Ling Zixiao, which would then allow them to improve to greater realms.Who among the new disciples is able to compete with him?Xu Qian was quite astonished too, who then decided to befriend with Ling Zixiao as he declared, \u201cNow, as a representative of the Mystic Spirit Sect, I declare Ling Zixiao to come first in the test with nine hundred steps. Does anyone have anything to say about that?\u201dIt immediately grabbed the attention of the crowd, which caused the disciples to exchange glances with each other, and shook their heads after.What comments could they have?Ling Zixiao proceeded forward nine hundred steps, beating Senior Brother Huang Long; what could they even say?At that moment, Ling Zixiao was positioned in the spotlight of the crowd. A prideful expression appeared on his face as he smiled instinctively, enjoying the worshiping gazes from the crowd, as if he was now considered the first-ranked genius among all the new disciples.\u201cThank you, Senior Brother Xu\u2026\u201d Ling Zixiao let out a satisfying smile and brought his fists together.However, before he could finish his sentence, a calm voice was heard all of a sudden; \u201cWait.\u201dThe voice was even more outstanding and annoying in the current situation.Everyone\u2019s expression was replaced by anger as they immediately turned around. They could not wait to find out who the person was, to be so ruthless at this crucial moment and disrupt the atmosphere.\\nWith a glance, everyone was stunned.The one speaking was none other than Qin Nan, who had remained silent the whole time.Xu Qian did not expect anyone to reject his declaration at this moment; he immediately turned mad, with a forceful murderous intent arose within him. Despite that, he could only restrain his anger as he said in a cold tone, \u201cMere trash with seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation; what do you have to say?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Qin Nan nodded his head, with a calm face, as if he was not aware of Xu Qian\u2019s anger, and said in a calm tone, \u201cSenior Brother said it right. I do have something to say, an important thing indeed. I just want to ask, since I have yet to enter the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, yet to do the test, why would he be ranked first?\u201dToward the end of his sentence, a scornful tone could be felt from his words!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Where did he get his confidence from, to think that his Martial Heart was stronger and firmer than Senior Brother Ling Zixiao\u2019s?Xu Qian was startled for a moment, before he burst out laughing, treating Qin Nan\u2019s words as a joke; he said, \u201cTrash like you really thinks you\u2019re capable of competing with Junior Brother Ling Zixiao?\u201dAfter hearing the words, the geniuses who were led by Ling Zixiao recovered from their shock, especially Xiao Yunhe, who was enraged with flames of anger raging inside, and said with a murderous intent, \u201cQin Nan, who gave trash like you the confidence to be so cocksure? If you were to do the test, you won\u2019t even achieve four hundred steps!\u201dXu Qian was mad, Xiao Yunhe and the geniuses were mad; all the disciples who were initially stunned, had now awakened with mocking expressions on their faces.\u201cWhat? Did I hear it wrong? This trashy Qin Nan thinks he is stronger than Senior Brother Ling Zixiao?\u201d\u201cHumph, this Qin Nan had always been full of himself. He dares to talk big now and challenge Senior Brother Ling Zixiao; he\u2019s trying to kill himself.\u201d\\n\u201cHehehe, even though Senior Brother Ling Zixiao invited me to hunt Qin Nan down previously, which I did not accept. Now, it seems like even without Senior Brother Ling Zixiao\u2019s request, I would want to kill this disrespectful and ruthless scrub.\u201d\u201cSuch ruthless words, as if he is sure to win. Does this trashy Qin Nan really think he is unbeatable after killing Childe Gloomy Rage?\u201d\u201cEven Huang Long was defeated by Senior Brother Ling Zixiao, who gave him the guts to say such disrespectful words!\u201d\u2026\u2026At that instant, everyone became angry, and challenged Qin Nan with mocking, murderous, disdainful, and scornful words.Previously, among the two hundred and sixty disciples, due to the presence of Chu Yun and Xiao Leng, and the strength displayed by Qin Nan after killing Childe Gloomy Rage, only the geniuses led by Ling Zixiao were still planning to hunt Qin Nan down. But now, it seemed like every single disciple had a murderous intent toward Qin Nan, even without Ling Zixiao\u2019s invitation or the benefits he promised.Qin Nan was too ruthless; with a mere eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm, he dared to talk big, and even provoke the first-ranked genius among the new disciples, Senior Brother Ling Zixiao!If the crowd were not afraid of Qin Nan, Chu Yun, and Xiao Leng\u2019s strength, they would definitely have rushed toward Qin Nan and torn him to pieces at once.At that instant, not only was Qin Nan being condemned by the crowd, even Chu Yun and Xiao Leng let out wry smiles on their faces.Even though Chu Yun and Xiao Leng had witnessed Qin Nan\u2019s strength, and the surprises he had given them, they still felt Qin Nan was too cocky in his words.Even Huang Long was defeated by Ling Zixiao, how is Qin Nan able to compete with him?\\nQin Nan\u2019s expression remained calm, as if he did not realize he had just offended every disciple at the scene, including Xu Qian. He calmly spoke, \u201cSenior Brother Xu Qian, you are free to think that I\u2019m trash, a waste, but since this is a test set by the sect, you should follow the rules. I don\u2019t care if everyone else is convinced or not, I only know that I\u2019m definitely not impressed by the results.\u201dAfter hearing these words, everyone\u2019s mind went blank once again.They did not expect Qin Nan to speak so ruthlessly facing the accusations and anger from the crowd, to challenge Senior Brother Xu Qian, to challenge Senior Brother Ling Zixiao!Does this guy not fear death at all?After hearing this, Xu Qian\u2019s anger completely exploded within him, as he instinctively gathered his aura.However, before Xu Qian could react, this time, it was Ling Zixiao\u2019s turn to speak. With a prideful aura, he glanced down at Qin Nan and said with a peaceful tone, \u201cYou\u2019re quite impressive as trash, quite a brave one too. I\u2019ll give you a chance according to the rules; at the same time, I\u2019m giving everyone a chance to come out and have a go at the test if you\u2019re not convinced of the results.\u201dNo murderous intent could be felt from Ling Zixiao\u2019s words, as if he was not furious at Qin Nan being so cocky.The truth was, Ling Zixiao was extremely angry, but he kept it to himself, and gave Qin Nan a chance instead.It was because, his status was no longer the same after defeating Huang Long. He was currently the king among the new disciples; therefore, he should behave like one too.If what happened today were to make known to the Mystic Spirit Sect, people would think that he won the trials with brute force, which would be damaging to his great reputation.\\nOf course, this was not the reason why Ling Zixiao gave Qin Nan a chance.The most important reason was that Qin Nan did defeat him once with his Martial Skills Talent. Therefore, now was the time for him to win back his glory. Furthermore, as his desire to kill Qin Nan grew stronger, instead of killing him straight away, he planned to destroy him one step at a time\u2014to destroy his dignity, bringing him great pain so he would prefer to die rather than staying alive.Only then could Ling Zixiao finally has avenged himself.It was not enough to kill Qin Nan straight away!\u201cGreat, since Junior Brother Ling Zixiao said so, I\u2019ll give you a chance.\u201d Xu Qian restrained the anger in his heart and stared coldly at Qin Nan, as he said, \u201cI really want to know, with such a cocky attitude, how many steps you can take.\u201dAfter Xu Qian finished speaking, Xiao Yunhe, Duan Muyang, Wang Chu and Luo Jianhao all let out a hollow laugh, \u201cIf Senior Brother Ling Zixiao were not being merciful today, I\u2019d surely slay you like a dog, and teach you what it means to be respectful.\u201d\u201cHmph, trash like you won\u2019t even achieve three hundred steps!\u201d\u201cHAHAHA, Wang Chu said it right; I\u2019ll place my bet of one thousand Xiantian Pills, that three hundred steps would be his maximum limit!\u201d\u2026\u2026These disciples showed no mercy in mocking Qin Nan, or in other words, they had never treated Qin Nan seriously.Going up against Senior Brother Ling Zixiao? He\u2019s definitely out of his mind.Qin Nan ignored all the comments from the geniuses, as if he was deaf. With a calm expression, he slowly walked toward the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, as if he was taking a stroll in the park.\\nAfter seeing this, every disciple at the scene began to mock him.\u201cHmph, this guy really dares to try; I have no idea where he got his courage from.\u201d\u201cHAHAHA, I\u2019ll bet one hundred Xiantian Pills that he won\u2019t even defeat Wang Hu, his maximum limit would be one hundred and ninety-nine steps!\u201d\u201cOne hundred ninety-nine steps? I think you\u2019re overestimating him. With such a scornful attitude, his Martial Heart is surely weak as hell. I bet he will die in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods upon reaching the one hundred and fiftieth step.\u201d\u201cHmm? One hundred and fifty steps? I\u2019ll bet one hundred steps then!\u201d\u2026\u2026The mocking voices of the crowd were like rumbling waves that went high up in the air and crushed heavily toward Qin Nan\u2019s tiny figure, trying to bury and destroy Qin Nan completely.As for Chu Yun and Xiao Leng, pale expressions could be seen on their faces, as they assumed Qin Nan would not be able to produce a miracle this time.Only Huang Long, who was not far away in a weakened state, had his eyes fully focused on Qin Nan\u2019s back, while he clenched his fists tightly.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Previously, after seeing Qin Nan advancing forward with ease, they were quite worried that Qin Nan would beat them easily.After collected their thoughts, the four broke the silence by saying in a mocking tone, \u201cHmph, looks like we all have underestimated this trash. It\u2019s reasonable for this trash to reach the three hundred and ninety-ninth steps with his eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. However, it seems like that will be his limit.\u201dThe scornful comments from the geniuses awakened the disciples from their shock.They all let out sighs of relief, before their faces were filled with scornful expressions.With only a result of three hundred and ninety-nine steps, why would this Qin Nan be so daring to challenge Senior Brother Ling Zixiao?Despite that, in the next moment, Qin Nan began to move again.\\nHis figure advanced forward with the same pace, like a ferocious beast dashing forward in the woods, as if the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods had no effect on him.In a blink of an eye, Qin nan achieved four hundred steps.After three breaths\u2019 time, Qin Nan reached the five hundredth step.After six breaths\u2019 time, Qin Nan had advanced forward six hundred steps. The same as previously, his figure came to a halt.Every disciple, including Xiao Yunhe\u2019s crew and the other geniuses froze upon seeing this. The disdainful expressions on their faces had stiffened, as a great astonishment could be seen in their eyes.Although six hundred steps were nowhere close to Huang Long and Ling Zixiao\u2019s results, Qin Nan had surpassed Xiao Yunhe and became the third on the ranking.But, how could trash like Qin Nan achieve six hundred steps?Under everyone\u2019s astonishment, Qin Nan\u2019s voice was heard, \u201cOops, For Xiao Yunhe, Duan Muyang, Wang Chu, Luo Jianhao, and those who thought I could only achieve one hundred fifty steps, I\u2019m so sorry. I have definitely let you guys down, as I somehow reached the six-hundredth step without noticing.\u201dThe whole crowd fell into silence after hearing this.For Xiao Yunhe, Duan Muyang, Wang Chu, Luo Jianhao, the geniuses, and the disciples at the scene, Qin Nan\u2019s words were like a powerful slap to their faces, causing their faces to burn in pain.Didn\u2019t you say Qin Nan could only reach the one hundred and fiftieth step?Didn\u2019t you say Qin Nan could only achieve three hundred and ninety-nine steps?I\u2019m sorry, I somehow reached the sixth hundredth step without noticing!\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Xiao Yunhe and his crew twisted their faces incredibly, as they were consumed by flames of anger. They had no idea how to refute him. After taking a deep breath, and with a dull expression, Xiao Yunhe let out a hollow laugh, \u201cQin Nan, so what if you\u2019ve reached the six-hundredth step? Even if your Martial Heart is stronger than ours, do you think that you can beat Senior Brother Ling Zixiao\u2019s? In my opinion, you could only achieve at most seven hundred steps!\u201d\\nXiao Yunhe\u2019s words caused the disciples to collect their thoughts and clench their teeth.\u201cRight, seven hundred steps will be your limit. If you don\u2019t agree, then try achieving eight hundred steps!\u201d\u201cHumph, so what if you\u2019ve reached the seven-hundredth step, you\u2019re unworthy before Senior Brother Ling Zixiao, you\u2019re still trash!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, what rights does trash have to be so cocky here?\u201d\u2026\u2026At this moment, even Xu Qian, who was managing the test, eventually said, \u201cQin Nan, being able to achieve six hundred steps\u2014or even seven hundred steps\u2014you\u2019re considered a top genius among the disciples here. However, you\u2019re too full of yourself, to think you\u2019re able to defeat Junior Brother Ling Zixiao? I\u2019m telling you, even after cultivating for a hundred years, you have no chance\u2026\u201dBefore Xu Qian could finish talking, a shocking sight occurred before them.Qin Nan\u2019s figure started moving forward again with increasing speed, and steady steps!Six hundred and fifty steps!Seven hundred steps!Seven hundred and fifty steps!Eight hundred steps!After reaching the eight-hundredth step, Qin Nan\u2019s figure came to a stop, and his voice was heard once again, \u201cGuys, I\u2019m really sorry.

A slap to their left, and another one to their right; they could even hear the noise of the impact in their thoughts!It felt like their faces were swollen from the endless slaps!The first time they mocked Qin Nan, they received a slap to their faces. The second time when they mocked Qin Nan again, they received another merciless slap to their faces.\\nAt this moment, Ling Zixiao ran out of patience, as he said in a cold tone, with a twisted expression, \u201cDon\u2019t worry guys, it\u2019s only eight hundred steps.

He was only a step away from reaching Ling Zixiao\u2019s nine hundred steps.This time, Qin Nan was not only slapping their faces, he was also slapping Ling Zixiao\u2019s!At the same time, Xu Qian, Xiao Yunhe, Duan Muyang, Wang Chu, Luo Jianhao, the geniuses and all the disciples, had their eyes opened wide in astonishment.The sight before them was too shocking, as if they had just been struck directly by rays of thunder.How is this possible?How could Qin Nan reach the eight hundred and ninety-ninth step?Once again, Qin Nan\u2019s calm voice was heard, \u201cSo, what do you guys say?

If my ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit did not have the capability of soothing my thoughts, I would not have achieved nine hundred steps. Even Huang Long with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was unable to withstand that pressure!\u201dLing Zixiao\u2019s words served as something like a grenade, which awoke all the disciples at the scene.After hearing the words, Xu Qian, Xiao Yunhe and the others let out sighs of relief, and continued to glance at Qin Nan disdainfully.\\nSo what if you\u2019ve reached the eight hundred and ninety-ninth step, having the same result as Huang Long?You merely possess an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. It\u2019s impossible for you to achieve nine hundred steps, not to mention anything beyond it.Despite that, many of the disciples were doubtful, as Qin Nan had presented them with too many miracles. What if Qin Nan is going to produce another miracle?At that instant, Huang Long\u2014who was extremely weak\u2014let out a sigh and said in a low tone, \u201cLing Zixiao is right, even with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, one is unable to complete the nine hundredth step without any method of calming their thoughts, which is why I was defeated\u2026\u201dAfter hearing Huang Long\u2019s words, the atmosphere of the scene turned lively. Every disciple let out a sigh of relief, and instinctively glanced at Qin Nan with scornful looks.Now that Huang Long had said so, even he with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was unable to take the nine hundredth step, what could someone with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit like you do?Chu Yun and Xiao Leng\u2019s expressions changed greatly and their bodies started to tremble after hearing this.Does that mean that after creating miracles one after another, Qin Nan is finally going to lose here?\u201cIs that so?\u201d Qin Nan\u2019s voice was heard from the deep region of the woods, \u201cIt seems like you guys have yet to have enough of me slapping your faces, still remaining unbelieving of me. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll show you all what I can achieve today.\u201dUpon hearing this, the smile on Ling Zixiao\u2019s face stiffened, as an uneasy feeling arose within him.Could it be this Qin Nan is confident he is able to take the nine hundredth step?\\nFollowing this, Ling Zixiao\u2019s expression changed greatly.Even though Qin Nan was now deep within the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods and they were unable to see his figure, they could still sense his aura, and could tell that he started moving again.Nine hundred and twenty steps!Nine hundred and forty steps!Nine hundred and sixty steps!Nine hundred and eighty steps!Nine hundred and ninety-nine steps!In that instant, Qin Nan roamed through the woods like a giant, and reached the nine hundred ninety-ninth step\u2014he was only a step away from achieving the legendary one thousand steps.Meanwhile, every disciple was extremely shocked, as if an explosion had occurred in their minds, causing them to lose their consciousness and their ability to think.Although it only took a brief while for Qin Nan to achieve nine hundred and ninety-nine steps, every step that Qin Nan took within this period was like trampling over their souls, causing them to shiver.Qin Nan managed to exceed nine hundred steps, surpassing both Huang Long and Ling Zixiao!Not only that, he achieved nine hundred and ninety-nine steps in one go, which made Ling Zixiao trail ninety-nine steps behind.Despite the fact that it was only ninety nine steps of a difference, everyone knew that every step toward the end was extremely difficult.\u201cYou all should open your eyes wide, and look closely!\u201d At this moment, Qin Nan\u2019s voice exploded deep within the woods, \u201cAs I\u2019m about to conquer the thousandth step!\u201dThe words felt like an incredible thunder striking across the sky.Xu Qian was immersed in great shock, and had his expression twisted when he heard the words, as he blurted out, \u201cThe thousandth step? You\u2019re trying to achieve one thousand steps? Are you out of your mind? No one from the Mystic Spirit Sect had ever succeeded in reaching the thousandth step. Those who challenged the thousandth step all ended up dying, including super geniuses with tenth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirits!\u201d\\nAt that instant, everyone\u2019s brain began to buzz.Challenging the thousandth step?The step which no one had done before in the past?The step that even super geniuses with tenth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirits failed to achieve?Meanwhile, deep within the woods, Qin Nan emitted a bursting aura; he clenched his fists and his teeth tightly, his eyes turned red as he gathered all his might to raise his foot, to complete the thousandth step.However, an incredible force exploded within the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, which encapsulated Qin Nan and crushed down upon him, prohibiting his leg from moving forward, despite him trying his very best.Bang! Bang! Bang!At the same time, Qin Nan\u2019s arms exploded, his chest exploded, his legs exploded. Endless streams of blood bursted out from the wounds, his bones began to produce a crackling sound, which then exploded continuously inch by inch.His whole body was covered in great pain, which caused him to be on the verge of losing his consciousness.\u201cThrough receiving the reformation from the Divine Battle Spirit, my Martial Heart has improved greatly. The previous nine hundred and ninety-nine steps were nothing against me. But now, I am unable to complete this thousandth step, which is the only one giving me pressure?\u201d\u201cThe step that no one achieved before; I swear I\u2019ll achieve it today, and produce a real miracle! Even if my cultivation and body are destroyed, you will not stop my will!\u201dAt that instant, Qin Nan\u2019s will had reached its limit, as he let out a roar upward into the sky, \u201cThe Divine Battle Spirit fights against the Heaven and Earth; there\u2019s no one it won\u2019t fight, there\u2019s nothing it won\u2019t against; I am the bearer of the Divine Battle Spirit, why would I be stopped by a mere Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods?\u201d\\nFollowing this, the terrifying pressure, the endless pain, the shattered body, the bursting streams of blood, the crushed bones, all vanished like a disappearing illusion; everything returned back to normal.Qin Nan was perfectly unharmed and raised his right foot, and landed onto the ground, completing the one thousandth step!BANG!A loud explosion was heard, as Qin Nan\u2019s aura reached its peak and he had a breakthrough, reaching the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm. His body\u2019s strength greatly improved.As Qin Nan completed his step, the great pressure from the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods had forced him to have a breakthrough!Meanwhile, the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods underwent a complete change.Each ancient-looking bamboo in the woods began to emit a shuffling sound, which all combined together to produce an imperious musical composition. Countless golden rays were emitted together with the musical piece which covered the whole woods, as if an emperor had arrived from above!In that instant, Ling Zixiao, Huang Long, Xu Qian, Chu Yun, Xiao Leng, the other geniuses, and all the disciples were left speechless looking at the rare occurrence before them!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The step which countless geniuses of the Mystic Spirit Sect failed to achieve, he has done it!\u201dAt that instant, despite being a Martial Emperor, Xu Qian had completely lost his ground.It was not really his fault. The sight before him was too shocking.All the disciples had their mouths opened wide, speechless after hearing the screams.They previously had kept on mocking Qin Nan, but in the end, not only had the reality given them a great slap on their face, Qin Nan was also the first one in the history of the Mystic Spirit Sect to achieve one thousand steps in the Trials of Versatility.This caused them to be curious about one thing, How strong was Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Heart?Ling Zixiao, Xiao Yunhe, and the other geniuses were rooted on the spot, with blank expressions on their faces.Particularly Ling Zixiao, whose mind went totally blank.After defeating Huang Long, he would not have believed anyone to have a firmer Martial Heart than his.No to mention that Qin Nan was always insignificant like an ant in Ling Zixiao\u2019s eyes.However, the scene before him was like thunder on a sunny day, which struck Ling Zixiao down from his altar high above.Not only was Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Heart stronger than his, it also defeated all the previous geniuses of the Mystic Spirit Sect\u2014perfectly unmatched, placing him at the top.Meanwhile, in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods where the rare occurrence was taking place, Qin Nan found himself standing at the deepest part of the woods, with a smile on his face.By achieving a thousand steps, not only had his cultivation improved to the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm and his strength refined, his Martial Heart grew stronger and firmer, stable like a monolith.\\n\u201cThis Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods is actually used by the sect to train all the new disciples; if one is able to withstand its pressure, it will bring great benefits.\u201dQin Nan exclaimed in his mind, before he stomped his foot on the ground and exited the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods.As Qin Nan was walking toward the exit, a stunning sight occurred; the rare occurrence of the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods returned to its calm state, as all the bamboo shoots turned alive and created a clear pathway for Qin Nan.Everyone, with their eyes open wide, glanced at Qin Nan as he walked out from the woods using the pathway at a slow pace.As Qin Nan came into his sight, Xiao Leng collected his thoughts and blurted out, \u201cBrother Nan, did\u2026 did\u2026 did you actually reach the one thousandth step, the historical achievement?\u201dBeside Xiao Leng stood Chu Yun, whose eyes were glistening.Even though they both had recovered from the shock, it still felt like a dream for them. Did Qin Nan just make history, and defeat Ling Zixiao just like that?Qin Nan smilingly nodded at the two of them, without saying anything. He then turned around toward Xu Qian as he withdrew the smile on his face and said, \u201cSenior Brother Xu Qian, my apologies for letting you down again. I accidentally surpassed Ling Zixiao.\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Nan glanced over the crowd and said in a humble tone, \u201cEveryone, I\u2019m so sorry. I accidentally achieved a thousand steps.\u201dPA!Everyone at the scene, including Xu Qian, felt like they had just received a great slap to their faces, resulting in a burning sensation.These two sentences were indeed very painful to hear.Despite that, no one dared to refute; no one dared to mock him.\\nQin Nan had achieved one thousand steps, creating history at this moment. It did not make sense if they could continue to mock him, right?Furthermore, even after being brought to shame like that, everyone could no longer feel agitated.It was all their own fault to begin with; if they did not look down on Qin Nan, why would he pay them back by shaming them and giving them a hard slap to the face?Qin Nan looked at the crowd, without mocking them further; he then said calmly to Xu Qian, \u201cSenior Brother, will now be the time for you to declare the results? I remember you said that whoever achieve one thousand steps would receive twenty Blue Dragon Badges, and a great prize from the sect.\u201dHearing the words, everyone halted their breath instantly.They were previously immersed in the shock of witnessing Qin Nan making history, causing them to forget something important.Since Qin Nan has achieved a thousand steps, didn\u2019t that make him the first in the Trials of Versatility?Xu Qian hesitated for a moment before taking a deep breath.Previously, he made the decision to fawn over Ling Zixiao, and treat Qin Nan disdainfully; he had even mocked Qin Nan verbally.Now that Qin Nan had displayed his incredible Martial Heart, Xu Qian no longer assumed Qin Nan was only trash. It was quite the opposite, as it only took him a short while, before he stepped forward and exclaimed without considering Ling Zixiao\u2019s thoughts, \u201cAccording to the rules, Qin Nan who created a historical act today by achieving a thousand steps, is ranked first in this test. He will receive twenty Blue Dragon Badges!\u201dAfter saying this, Xu Qian waved his hand; twenty shiny badges then appeared flying toward Qin Nan.These were the twenty Blue Dragon Badges as promised.\\nAt this moment, everyone\u2019s gaze locked onto the Blue Dragon Badges in Qin Nan\u2019s hand. Their breathing instinctively became rapid as flames of lust were ignited deep within them.These were twenty Blue Dragon Badges. With them, anyone would become the first place in the Trials of Versatility, which comes with great benefits!\u201cJunior Brother Qin Nan, as for the prize from the sect, you will need to wait until the results are reported to the elders.\u201d Xu Qian said.\u201cThank you, Senior Brother Xu.\u201dQin Nan brought his fists together.Even though Xu Qian verbally mocked him before, as Qin Nan had already made his payback, plus Xu Qian\u2019s attitude toward him had changed, there was no need for Qin Nan to be unforgiving.However, at this moment, a voice filled with murderous intent exploded all of a sudden, \u201cQin Nan!\u201dThe origin of the voice was none other than Ling Zixiao.A completely twisted expression could be seen on Ling Zixiao\u2019s face, as his body was covered in an incredible murderous aura; a strong sense of hatred could be seen in his eyes.At this instant, Ling Zixiao had gone completely mad; he no longer had the fake gentlemanly appearance like before.This was because, previously at the Skill Library\u2014after losing to Qin Nan in the Martial Talent Battle\u2014he was forced to leave silently as he was prohibited to enter the Skill Library for the rest of his life. Now, even though he finally succeeded in defeating his biggest opponent, Huang Long, he had lost to Qin Nan once again.If not for Qin Nan, these twenty Blue Dragon Badges were supposed to be given to him.If not for Qin Nan, he would be the one in the spotlight!However, everything was stolen by Qin Nan. How would he not be mad?\\nEveryone\u2019s heart skipped a beat after seeing Ling Zixiao\u2019s current expression.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They used to look down on Qin Nan, or even had the intention of killing him after being recruited by Ling Zixiao. However, after Qin Nan achieved a thousand steps, the disciples instinctively felt respect toward Qin Nan, not daring to speak any further.They were only analyzing the situation before them from their own perspectives.Meanwhile, Ling Zixiao took a big step forward, his gaze locked onto Qin Nan. An incredible sense of hatred could be seen flickering in his eyes as he said, \u201cQin Nan, what a surprise. I really did not expect that apart from your great Martial Skill Talent, even your Martial Heart is able to defeat me. In terms of these two, I have to admit; you are way stronger than I am. However, in the Martial Art world, it\u2019s useless to have a great Martial Skill Talent, and a firm Martial Heart, as your cultivation is still trash!\u201d\\nAfter saying this, Xiao Yunhe and the other geniuses behind Ling Zixiao let out evil grins before emitting powerful auras from their bodies.At that instant, over fifty disciples burst out their auras using their cultivation, which combined into a powerful surge of wind, allowing the crowd to feel a terrifying force being gathered.At that instant, these disciples all unleashed their murderous intent toward Qin Nan.Just as Ling Zixiao said, Qin Nan\u2019s great Martial Skill Talent and firm Martial Heart was useless at this moment. Besides that, due to the great potential Qin Nan displayed, these geniuses were even more eager to murder him.If Qin Nan weren\u2019t to be slain today, he would become a great threat in the future!Upon seeing this, Xiao Leng and Chu Yun\u2019s expressions changed greatly, and they immediately moved close to Qin Nan without hesitation.At the same time, Huang Long\u2014who was still in a weakened state\u2014rose from the ground and said laughingly, \u201cLing Zixiao, I always knew that you were a sore loser. If you wish to fight, then I, your Grandfather Huang Long, shall have some fun with you all.\u201dAfter saying this, Huang Long\u2019s aura transformed instantly into a ferocious beast with a human figure\u2014the powerful aura caused the crowd to be stunned.Although in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods Huang Long had lost to Ling Zixiao regarding Martial Heart, and was severely injured, since Huang Long\u2019s cultivation had reached the half-Xiantian stage, he still posed a great threat even despite his injuries.At this moment, the atmosphere of the scene intensified.With Huang Long\u2019s decision to interfere, even though there were only four people on Qin Nan\u2019s side, their combined aura was not in anyway weaker than Ling Zixiao\u2019s group.After seeing this, a cold gaze flickered in Ling Zixiao\u2019s eyes, which were already filled with hatred, as he said, \u201cHuang Long, you\u2019re mismatched against us with your injuries. Are you sure you want to stand on their side? If that\u2019s your decision, then I shall send you to hell!\u201d\\nThe geniuses behind Ling Zixiao gathered their might; they were ready to charge toward their enemies with a single command from Ling Zixiao.Huang Long glanced at Ling Zixiao before he smiled disdainfully and said, \u201cSo what if I\u2019m heavily injured? I can still smash you; Ling Zixiao, stop wasting time on nonsense, fight me if you want!\u201dThe last sentence was almost a roar coming from Huang Long, as nine golden rays flickered behind him along with a huge sword covered in blood that emitted a powerful murderous aura.Huang Long was indeed being himself\u2014hot-tempered. Even though he was suffering a severe injury, he was not afraid to battle.\u201cWell, well, well. I shall grant you your death wish!\u201dAfter seeing this, Ling Zixiao burst out a murderous intent, with nine golden rays together along with a fiery flute rising behind him.The two greatest geniuses among the new disciples had both unleashed their Martial Spirits at this moment, prepared to have a great battle!Everyone at the scene held their breaths as their heart beated rapidly, with their eyes opened wide.A battle between two super geniuses involving other geniuses was a rare sight indeed.Even Xu Qian, who was a Martial Emperor and an inner disciple, held his breath after seeing this, as if he did not want to miss out on any aspect of the battle.However, at this instant, a calm voice appeared out of nowhere, \u201cGuys, can you all listen to me?\u201dThe owner of the voice was none other than the previously silent Qin Nan.Qin Nan\u2019s words caused the intense atmosphere to pause briefly, as everyone switched their focuses onto Qin Nan.What does Qin Nan have to say at this stage?Under everyone\u2019s attention, Qin Nan slowly walked forward and stared directly at the enraged Ling Zixiao, before saying calmly, \u201cLing Zixiao, it\u2019s always been a personal conflict between us two. There\u2019s no need to involve the others right? That being said, I\u2019m not saying this because I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re getting overwhelmed by your quantity; I only want to resolve this with my own hands.\u201d\\nEveryone was dumbfounded after listening to the words, unable to make any sense of them.What does Qin Nan mean with his words? Does he want to fight Ling Zixiao alone?Qin Nan hesitated for a while, before he drew his saber from his waist and his gaze turned sharp, \u201cLing Zixiao, if you\u2019re brave enough, accept my challenge of life and death!\u201dQin Nan\u2019s tone intensified toward the end of the sentence, which turned into a roar.With a slash, his saber pointed toward Ling Zixiao with a forceful battle intent!Despite that, everyone at the scene was completely stunned.Qin Nan dares to take the initiative to challenge Ling Zixiao?Is he out of his mind?\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Qin Nan is a pretty good example!\u201d\u201cF**k, does Qin Nan not care about his life?

Despite that, he had never expected Qin Nan to challenge him upfront.Could it be that this guy has the confidence to defeat me?\u201cWhy would I fight you one on one?\u201d Ling Zixiao inhaled deeply and said with a cold expression, \u201cI\u2019ve got over fifty geniuses here, and you only have four. You guys are sure to die if the battle breaks out. I have no intention to fight you alone. I plan to crush you all with the larger quantity I have.\u201dThis time, Ling Zixiao chose not to accept Qin Nan\u2019s challenge immediately.He had lost to Qin Nan two times in a row; every time, he always thought himself as the winner, but in the end, he turned out to be the loser.Ling Zixiao\u2019s words continued to stun the crowd.They never expected Ling Zixiao to be so cautious in dealing with Qin Nan\u2019s challenge.On the other hand, Qin Nan let out a smile after hearing these words, and said, \u201cI did expect you would reject my challenge. You were defeated in both Martial Skill Talent and Martial Heart. It is reasonable that you are scared to be defeated again in this duel.\u201dObviously, these words served as clear prodding.Despite that, everyone could see Ling Zixiao\u2019s face twist completely at this moment.The words had touched upon the scar on his heart.\u201cWell, well, well.\u201d Ling Zixiao laughed hollowly, as his eyes filled with murderous intent, \u201cQin Nan, since you\u2019ve prodded me so, I\u2019ll fulfill your wish. I would like to see how you plan to defeat me with your meager cultivation!\u201dAfter saying this, Ling Zixiao stepped forward and unleashed the suppressing aura with his ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit toward the crowd.\\nThe disciples were left speechless after witnessing this.Ling Zixiao rejected Qin Nan\u2019s challenge to a solo battle, but Qin Nan chose to prod him into accepting it; is he trying to kill himself?Does Qin Nan really think\u2014after making history by achieving a thousand steps in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods\u2014that he is invincible now?Martial Heart and cultivation are not the same concepts!Upon seeing this, Xiao Yunhe, Duan Muyang and the other geniuses recovered from their shock; Xiao Yunhe, in particular, let out a mocking laugh and said, \u201cQin Nan, who on earth gave you the courage to provoke Senior Brother Ling Zixiao like that? With your current cultivation, you\u2019re not even my opponent; where did you get the confidence from to challenge Senior Brother Ling Zixiao?\u201dThe other geniuses all voiced their opinions while laughing mockingly.\u201cHe dares to be so full of himself with a mere eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and a cultivation of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm!\u201d\u201cHehe, I think this Qin Nan is too proud of himself after achieving a thousand steps.\u201d\u201cI bet that Senior Brother Ling Zixiao could defeat Qin Nan in just three moves!\u201d\u2026\u2026After hearing the discussion among these geniuses, Chu Yun\u2019s group of three did not look pleasant, and a sense of helplessness filled their hearts, as they had no idea how to change Qin Nan\u2019s mind.The only thing they could do was to fully focus on the battle before them, and forcefully save Qin Nan when things went wrong.At this moment, Qin Nan, being the focus of the crowd, let out a laugh while staring at Ling Zixiao and said, \u201cLing Zixiao, even though I think of you as someone shameless, fake, evil, and scornful, your current decision is the most utterly impressive. Let\u2019s skip the nonsense, and show me what you\u2019ve got!\u201d\\nAfter saying this, Qin Nan\u2019s battle intent rose instantly, as his excitement could be seen from his expression.Due to the influence of the Divine Battle Spirit, his thoughts were constantly refined, and had transformed, causing him to have a strong lust for battle, especially against those who were stronger than him. Instead of being intimidated, he would be extremely excited, giving him a stronger battle intent.\u201cEat this!\u201dUpon seeing Qin Nan\u2019s attitude, Ling Zixiao was consumed by flames of anger, as his figure instantly dashed forward at lightning speed, approaching Qin Nan while lashing out his fist toward him.The punch was accompanied with a terrifying force, and a shocking intent.The force was the might of the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm; the intent was emitted from his Perfection Stage of One with the Weapon!In that instant, every single disciple\u2019s expression changed greatly.They could only feel that the punch from Ling Zixiao was so powerful that it was as if it could penetrate a mountain; the force it contained was way beyond their imagination.The aura from merely a punch was enough to cause their hearts to shiver.

Qin Nan, you have mastered the Minor Success Stage of the Arcane Realm!\u201d As a Martial Emperor, Xu Qian was quick to notice the reason behind it, and blurted out, \u201cAchieving the Arcane Realm with a mere eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation!\u201dEven Xu Qian was utterly shocked at this moment.As everyone knew, Arcane Realm was the next level after the state of One with the Weapon.Achieving the Arcane Realm was really not a big deal; the problem was, Xu Qian had never seen any disciple to achieve it with a mere cultivation of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm!\\nEven the super geniuses of the Mystic Spirit Sect could only achieve it after their cultivation had reached the Xiantian Realm.The crowd was instantly awakened from their shock after hearing these words; everyone took a deep breath instinctively.\u201cMinor Success Stage of the Arcane Realm. Qin Nan has mastered the Minor Success Stage of the Arcane Realm!\u201d\u201cNo wonder Qin Nan had the guts to challenge Ling ZIxiao, as he has achieved the legendary Arcane Realm!\u201d\u201cTsk, this is shocking. He does have the ability to defeat stronger opponents with ease after achieving the Arcane Realm.\u201d\u201cThis Qin Nan\u2019s Martial Skill Talent is absolutely terrifying; when Ling Zixiao has only mastered the Perfection Stage of One with the Weapon, he has already achieved the Arcane Realm!\u201d\u2026\u2026At that instant, the disciples were startled; their gazes toward Qin Nan were filled with respect.Since Qin Nan was able to knock Ling Zixiao back with a single slash, it indicated that he had no problem killing ordinary tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivators.Chu Yun, Xiao Leng, and Huang Long let out sighs of relief simultaneously; a hint of joy could be seen in their eyes.They all knew the significance of Qin Nan reaching the Arcane Realm.Even Ling Zixiao, a super genius, would have a hard time trying to defeat Qin Nan.As for Xiao Yunhe, Duan Muyang, and the other geniuses, their expressions turned unpleasant, as they did not expect Qin Nan to have achieved the Arcane Realm.If they were to battle Qin Nan now, they would surely be outmatched.This was due to the fact that the difference in strength between every realm was incredibly huge.Meanwhile, Ling Zixiao\u2014who was knocked back by Qin Nan\u2019s attack\u2014wore a cold expression and said, \u201cQin Nan, I knew something was not right when you dared to challenge me. It seems like my guess was right, who would expect you to have achieved the Arcane Realm.\u201d\\nA calm expression remained on Qin Nan\u2019s face as he said, \u201cSo, the battle just started, Are you already afraid?\u201d\u201cAfraid?\u201d Ling Zixiao burst out laughing as if he had just heard the best joke of his life, \u201cHAHAHA, Qin Nan, you\u2019re too full of yourself. Do you really think you can defeat me after achieving the Arcane Realm? You have to understand, I too have mastered the Perfection Stage of One with the Weapon, plus I have reached the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm, which is two layers higher than yours. You\u2019re still not worthy to be my opponent even after achieving the Arcane Realm!\u201dAfter saying this, Ling Zixiao let out a deafening roar; a strong might burst out from his body, as he dashed toward Qin Nan with an intimidating aura.At this instant, Ling Zixiao no longer concealed his strength, and executed a Fist Technique; a sudden force of Fist Intent was emitted, as if it could destroy a whole mountain.This Fist Technique was the ultimate skill Ling Zixiao had mastered: Thousand Mountains Punch!\u201cBring it on!\u201dQin Nan yelled as he emitted a powerful Saber Intent with all his might, and slashed at Ling Zixiao.BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!Continuous explosions could be heard, as if a wave of grenades exploded before them.Powerful gusts of wind burst toward the surroundings like slashes of sharp blades, which destroyed many ancient-looking trees nearby.At this instant, every disciple was shocked; it seemed like there were two ferocious beasts with the appearance of humans battling against each other, creating a mess where the fights occurred. The force emitted from the battle caused their hearts to race.The intensity of the battle was way beyond their standards!At last, the strength of the Arcane Realm was displayed perfectly in this battle.\\nNot only had Qin Nan shown his powerful Saber Intent, his executions of Mystical Eight Steps and Thundercrash Saber Art were utterly impressive, showcasing his perfect mastery of the Martial Skills, outputting incredible force toward his enemy.As a result, Qin Nan\u2019s figure felt like a phantom; there was no way to predict his movement, while his Saber Intent continued to knock Ling Zixiao back.Upon seeing this. Xiao Yunhe, Duan Muyang, and the other geniuses had their faces twisted. They did not expect to witness Qin Nan, with a mere cultivation of eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm along with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, suppress Ling Zixiao so thoroughly.Everyone inhaled deeply after seeing this. They now realized how terrifying the Arcane Realm was.All of a sudden, an enraged roar could be heard, \u201cQin Nan, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dThe source of the roar was none other than Ling Zixiao.At this instant, after being suppressed by Qin Nan continuously, Ling Zixiao had completely lost his mind after running out of patience; he leapt into the air, with the Fiery Flute emitting endless flames behind him, along with a deafening melody.Ling Zixiao was going to execute his strongest attack!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The endless melody, like resonance of blades, entered the inflamed pagoda and bounced around, which eventually skyrocketed up into the sky together with the rolling flames!At that instant, a forceful aura was emitted, causing everyone at the scene to twist their faces and inhale deeply.\u201cSuch a terrifying force, as expected of a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. I\u2019m afraid this force is equivalent to someone who has reached the half-Xiantian state!\u201d\u201cTsk, I wouldn\u2019t stand any chance facing this.\u201d\u201cYou? Even someone with a tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation would be destroyed instantly!\u201d\u2026\u2026Apart from the disciples, Xiao Leng and Chu Yun were utterly stunned too. Even Huang Long straightened his face after seeing this.The three instinctively held their breaths, and clenched their fists; the forces within their bodies were accumulated, ready to lash out with their strongest attacks!Meanwhile, with the forceful aura emitted from Ling Zixiao\u2019s execution of Nine-Layered Pagoda Devil Suppressing Melody with his Fiery Flute Martial Spirit, even Qin Nan\u2014who had reached the Arcane Realm\u2014appeared to be miniscule, as if he would be swallowed any time.The difference between the two\u2019s strength was instantly evident.Xiao Yunhe, Duan Muyang, and the other geniuses who were previously cold-looking, looked excited after seeing this; once again, their gazes at Qin Nan were filled with disdain.\\n\u201cHAHAHA, the strongest attack, this is Senior Brother Ling Zixiao\u2019s strongest attack. Qin Nan\u2014not so smug now, are you!\u201d\u201cHumph, think you\u2019re invincible after achieving the Arcane Realm? I do admit that you\u2019re strong, but you\u2019re still like an ant before Senior Brother Ling Zixiao\u2019s attack!\u201d\u201cHehe, so scornful and full of yourself; I would like to see how prideful you are this time!\u201d\u2026\u2026These geniuses were enlivened, with a feeling of exaltation.After hearing the words of the geniuses and witnessing the scene before them, the disciples could not help but glance at Qin Nan with pitiful looks.\u201cSigh, Qin Nan is dead for sure this time, such a great talent is to die here.\u201d\u201cYeah, even Xiao Yunhe is outmatched by his talent.\u201d\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t so full of himself, even though he is slightly weaker than Ling Zixiao and Huang Long, he could definitely be the first ranked among the top ten geniuses.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t help it. It all came to this as he was too cocky, with no idea of how to conceal himself. It\u2019s all his own fault.\u201d\u2026\u2026Unlike those geniuses, these disciples did not mock him. The strength that Qin Nan displayed previously had won their respects. As a result, they felt sorry to see a genius like Qin Nan die here.Even Xu Qian could not help but shake his head and let out a sigh in his heart after seeing this.As a Martial Emperor expert, he could easily tell how powerful Ling Zixiao\u2019s attack was. With it, Qin Nan was sure to die; even with his Martial Spirit, he wouldn\u2019t have a chance of changing the tide of the battle.\u201cHAHAHA, Qin Nan, do you see now?\u201d Ling Zixiao burst out laughing after hearing the comments from the crowd, \u201cEven if your Martial Skill Talent and your Martial Heart surpassed mine, there\u2019s still a huge difference between us since the beginning. A super genius with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit is not someone that you, with merely an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, could disrespect! Now die!\u201d\\nLing Zixiao seemed like he was using all his might to yell out the last sentence; the floating Nine-Layered Devil Suppressing Melody instantly came crushing down onto Qin Nan.Everyone\u2019s pupils contracted witnessing this, as if a huge mountain was crushing onto a tiny ant!Despite that, Qin Nan let out a sudden laugh; his laugh was ruthless, and filled with a rich battle intent, \u201cVery impressive, this is indeed the strongest attack of a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit! Only your strongest attack is worthy enough to make me excited, to make me use this ability!\u201dQin Nan\u2019s whole aura switched together with his laughter, as his finger pointed toward the sky.\u201cHeavenly Accumulating Strike!\u201dQin Nan let out a roar, as an arcane absorbing force appeared on the tip of his finger, which gathered all of Qin Nan\u2019s saber intent, forming a light dot with the size of a thumb.\u201cMore, this isn\u2019t enough!\u201dQin Nan\u2019s hair started to dance around wildly; following his roar, the light dot on the tip of his finger thoroughly gathered his eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation, his Intent of the Arcane Realm, and all his energy and strength.Despite that, at this moment, everyone was utterly stunned and stood shocked in the spot.They could tell that the tiny light dot on the tip of Qin Nan\u2019s finger continued to emit a terrifying force; even though nothing special had happened yet, the aura it emitted was enough to suppress Ling Zixiao\u2019s strongest attack.The smile on Ling Zixiao\u2019s face vanished as he lost his mind and screamed, \u201cImpossible! How is this possible? What kind of skill are you using, to be able to suppress my strongest attack like\u2026\u201dBefore Ling Zixiao could finish his sentence, his face contorted greatly as the sense of death arose from his heart, and his eyes filled with terror.\\nUnder everyone\u2019s gaze, the tiny little light dot, was fired.BANG!The moment the light dot was fired, a great force exploded, which turned into an enraged ocean with rolling waves, engulfing Ling Zixiao\u2019s figure instantly.Following it, endless gusts of wind exploded toward all directions like a hurricane, which caused everyone\u2019s hair to dance wildly.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As a result, Qin Nan was not able to accumulate the force of the Earth and Nature, but instead could only accumulate his own Saber Intent, his might, and his energy; he had to consume all the force within him to unleash such a terrifying force.If a first-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator were to attack Qin Nan now, he would be defeated with a single attack.This was the consequence of using the Heavenly Accumulating Strike; he would not be able to recover in a short time.Qin Nan took a deep breath, and tried his best to stand straight. He did not answer Xu Qian\u2019s question. Instead, his gaze fell upon Xiao Yunhe and the other geniuses.Qin Nan\u2019s gaze caused Xiao Yunhe and the other geniuses, who were still immersed in great shock, to shiver and wear frightened looks on their faces.Qin Nan slowly spoke, \u201cXiao Yunhe, do you still want to kill me?\u201d\\nXiao Yunhe, who stood in front of the crowd, felt like he was being electrocuted by the words, causing his body to tremble. He could not speak a single word.Qin Nan continued to speak, \u201cDuan Muyang, do you still want to kill me?\u201dAfter hearing this, Duan Muyang\u2019s face went pale white, and took a few steps backward instinctively.Qin Nan ignored him, and looked toward the third person, before saying, \u201cWang Chu, how about you?\u201dWang Chu, the sixth rank of the top ten geniuses, instantly shook his head crazily.Qin Nan glanced at the fourth person and said, \u201cLuo Jianhao, do you still want to kill me?\u201dLuo Jianhao held his breath and, all of a sudden, he dropped to his knees onto the ground; countless droplets of sweat could be seen on his forehead, as his face was filled with terror.Qin Nan ignored him, and stared at the over fifty disciples behind the four of them, and said calmly, \u201cHonestly, a single attack from any of you would be able to kill me straight away. I\u2019m on the edge of a cliff right now. Therefore, I shall ask you all, do any of you still want to kill me? Don\u2019t miss a good chance like this.\u201dThe crowd of over fifty geniuses remained dead silent; not a budge was seen, not a single sound was made. Everyone\u2019s face was as pale as a piece of paper, as if they were greatly injured.Qin Nan forcefully held his body upward, turned around and looked at the disciples, and pointed with his finger, \u201cYou, you, you, and you. That guy too, and this guy over here\u2026\u201dQin Nan pointed to more than a hundred people in a row, and said calmly, \u201cI still remember, that you all accepted Ling Zixiao\u2019s request to hunt me down on the Island of Versatility. Although Ling Zixiao is gone now, I still want to ask, do you guys still want to kill me?\u201d\\nThese disciples, were utterly stunned hearing these words.The group of disciples, the four top ten geniuses, and the fifty plus geniuses, were all dumbfounded.Under ordinary circumstances, they would not be so embarrassed, and so scared to face Qin Nan.However, they had witnessed everything with their own eyes throughout this journey.At the Mystic Spirit Sect, Qin Nan had crushed Ling Zixiao with his Martial Skill Talent.At the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, Qin Nan had broken the record of the Mystic Spirit Sect, and become the first person to achieve a thousand steps with his Martial Heart.In the battle against Ling Zixiao, with a cultivation base of eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, and an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, Qin Nan was able to completely destroy Ling Zixiao\u2014who had a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, and a cultivation of the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm\u2014with a single blow.How could they dare to kill someone who continued to make history, and had just killed a super genius?Even though they knew that Qin Nan was currently in his weakest state, and that it would be easy to defeat him now, they did not dare to move.This was due to his prestige and majesty.The prestige and majesty he displayed with his achievement of one thousand steps in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, and with Ling Zixiao\u2019s fresh blood.\u201cHAHAHA!\u201dQin Nan could not help but burst out laughing after seeing this.Previously at the White Jade Dojo, he was only a fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator, trash in everyone\u2019s eyes, the hunted of over two hundred disciples, the target of a super genius like Ling Zixiao. He had been mocked continuously, and treated like a dead man throughout the journey.Now?No one dared to talk when he spoke!\\n\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shoosh! Shoosh!A few gusts of wind could be heard, which appeared to be the five elders in charge of the Trial of Versatility.Following the arrival of the five elders, numerous presences with Martial Emperor auras approached, who were all inner disciples of the Mystic Spirit Sect. The ones leading the crowd were Mo Li and Xiao Qingxue.They had all gathered here as today was the conclusion of the Trial of Versatility.As soon as Mo Li arrived at the White Jade Dojo, he could not help but glance at Xiao Qingxue and burst out laughing, \u201cQingxue, I didn\u2019t expect you to be here too. Good timing, I\u2019ve got something to ask you. Do you think Junior Brother Qin Nan was able to survive in this Trial of Versatility?\u201dAfter hearing the words, the beautiful face of Xiao Qingxue turned cold instantly.Only after the start of the Trial of Versatility was she told that Mo Li and Ling Zixiao had come up with an evil plan\u2014to team up with two hundred and twenty disciples and hunt Qin Nan down on the Island of Versatility.When she heard the news, she was furious, but helpless. As it had already been done, even with her identity as an inner disciple, there was nothing she could do to interfere the Trial of Versatility.\\nAs a result, Xiao Qingxue was worried every day; she even prayed for Qin Nan secretly, hoping that he would not die on the Island of Versatility.Before Xiao Qingxue could say anything, the white-haired elder leading the other four elders said calmly, \u201cMo Li, such unwise words for the son of an elder. Qin Nan\u2014with a mere eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit\u2014dared to challenge Ling Zixiao, who is a super genius. There is no way he could survive in this Trial of Versatility. Therefore, your words were a waste of time.\u201dThe other four elders, and the inner disciples who came to welcome the return of the new disciples, chuckled after hearing this.They clearly knew what had happened previously at the White Jade Dojo.In their perspectives, even though Qin Nan possessed an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, since he had offended Ling Zixiao, and was being hunted by two hundred and twenty disciples, there was no chance of survival for him.Mo Li grinned after hearing the words, \u201cElder Yang, for your information, Junior Brother Qin Nan is the genius Xiao Qingxue discovered. It\u2019s reasonable for her to be worried, which is why I asked her that question\u2026\u201dAfter hearing this, the five elders and the inner disciples were startled.It was evident that, they had no idea that the prideful Qin Nan, who offended Ling Zixiao and roared at the crowd the other day at the White Jade Dojo, was the genius discovered by Xiao Qingxue.The white-haired elder frowned his eyebrows, before saying in a comforting tone, \u201cQingxue, not only has that Qin Nan prevented Ling Zixiao, a super genius, from entering the Skill Library for the rest of his life, he even dared to roar at the crowd after facing Ling Zixiao\u2019s anger. His actions were extremely ruthless and disrespectful; \u201cServes him right if he is dead, despite his great talent of possessing an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit. Thus, don\u2019t you worry about it\u2026\u201d\\nThe other elders all voiced out to comfort her.Even though these five elders did not care about Qin Nan at all, they still had to pay attention to Xiao Qingxue.After hearing the words from the five elders, Xiao Qingxue\u2019s straightened her beautiful face, as flames of fury were sparked deep within her attractive eyes.\u201cElders, please keep this useless talk to yourselves.\u201d Xiao Qingxue\u2019s expression turned cold as she glanced at Mo Li and said calmly, \u201cIf anything happens to Qin Nan, I\u2019ll not let you go so easily!\u201dThe faces of the five elders turned unsightly hearing the words.They never expected Xiao Qingxue to snap at them without respect, in favor of the miniscule Qin Nan.Although they were quite intimidated by Xiao Qingxue\u2019s identity, they were still considered inner elders, whom were respected by most of the inner disciples.Mo Li was not affected by Xiao Qingxue\u2019s warning; he turned to the five elders and said, \u201cElders, there\u2019s still some time before they return. How about we have a bet? Like if Qin Nan is dead or not?\u201dMo Li\u2019s words arrived at the perfect timing for the five elders.Even though they could not do anything to Xiao Qingxue, it did not mean they were afraid of her.The white-haired elder let out a smile and glanced at Xiao Qingxue purposely before saying, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll have a bet. However, to bet if Qin Nan is dead or not is not interesting at all, as Qin Nan is surely dead by now. Let\u2019s bet on the amount of attacks it took to kill him, or the amount of people it took. Now, this is more interesting.\u201dThe other elders joined the conversation immediately.\u201cInteresting; this Qin Nan with a cultivation of fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm and an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, could easily be defeated by ordinary seventh-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivators. Therefore, I\u2019ll bet that he was killed in three attacks, by a single person.\u201d\\n\u201cHeh, I don\u2019t agree. I would like to bet that he was killed in a single attack by a single person!\u201d\u201cTsk tsk, if you two think so, I\u2019ll bet that he was killed by a group of people.\u201d\u2026\u2026The other inner disciples exchanged glances with each other upon seeing this, but they chose to remain silent.In the Mystic Spirit Sect, even the inner disciples, were classified into different levels. Their identities were way more insignificant when compared to Mo Li and Xiao Qingxue.Despite that, while listening to the sarcastic comments of the five elders and Mo Li, they could not help but let out sighs of relief in their hearts. In their opinions, it was unwise for Xiao Qingxue to go against the five elders in favor of the miniscule Qin Nan.Besides that, with a logical perspective, wasn\u2019t Qin Nan guaranteed to be dead?To offend the five elders and Mo Li just because of a dead man, was not worth it at all.Xiao Qingxue\u2019s body shivered after hearing the words; the flames of anger grew stronger in her heart, but she held them back as now was not the time for her to explode.However, in the meantime, a calm voice could be heard, \u201cFive elders, Junior Brother Mo Li, you guys are really enjoying yourselves here. It seems like you guys have no idea that Qin Nan is my brother; could it be that you guys are disrespecting me by treating him as a joke?\u201dEveryone glanced toward the voice, and their faces contorted, including the five elders.The newcomer was none other than Gong Yang.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His position in the sect was only slightly lower than the core disciples of the sect. If he ended up having a lucky encounter, he might even have the chance to become a core disciple.The five elders might not be afraid of Xiao Qingxue, but they could not treat Gong Yang the same way.Mo Li\u2019s expression stiffened; he did not expect Gong Yang to be here too. He took a deep breath and said with a forced smile on his face, \u201cSenior Brother Gong Yang, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re mistaken. We\u2019re just discussing the facts.\u201dThe white-haired elder smilingly said, \u201cJunior Brother Gong Yang, don\u2019t be angry. Although our words were kind of harsh, you have to know that it\u2019s extremely difficult for Qin Nan to survive considering the situation he got himself into.\u201dThe other four elders nodded their heads in agreement, with pleasant smiles on their faces.But deep within them, the five elders were feeling gloomy; they never expected Qin Nan, a mere fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivator with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, would turn out to be close with Gong Yang.After seeing this, Xiao Qingxue\u2019s expression became calm, although a cold tone could still be sensed from her words, \u201cSenior Brother Gong Yang, if anything were to happen to Qin Nan, it would be Mo Li\u2019s fault.\u201dUpon hearing this, Mo Li was extremely terrified and instantly glimpsed at Gong Yang. He let out a sigh of relief after seeing Gong Yang\u2019s calm expression.If what happened to Qin Nan really caused Gong Yang to be angry toward him, that would be a disaster for him.\\n\u201cI already know what happened at the White Jade Dojo.\u201d Gong Yang nodded his head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, I don\u2019t believe Junior Brother Qin Nan would die so easily.\u201dHis confident tone caused everyone at the scene to be slightly startled.Even Xiao Qingxue was quite surprised; she could not understand why Gong Yang was so confident in Qin Nan, even though he only had a brief contact with him which lasted less than a day.After hearing this, Mo Li and the five elders felt the urge to laugh out, but they did not display this due to Gong Yang\u2019s presence.Despite their intention to remain silent, it was Gong Yang who turned to them and calmly said, \u201cI heard that you all were discussing a bet just then. That\u2019s quite interesting. Can I join too?\u201dThe five elders and Mo Li wore shocked expressions after hearing the words.The white-haired elder hesitated for a moment, before he smilingly said, \u201cJunior Brother Gong Yang, maybe we should skip the bet this time? Our words were indeed stepping over the boundary, as Qin Nan does have a chance to survive on the Island of Versatility.\u201dAlthough the elders did assume Qin Nan would surely die in the trial;, firstly, they were not fond of him, and secondly, it served as a way to mock Xiao Qingxue indirectly.However, since the destination of the transportation portal was randomized, after knowing he was being targeted by Ling Zixiao\u2019s two hundred and twenty disciples, Qin Nan could instead find a place to hide for a month, which would guarantee his safety.Not to mention that, the five elders would not want to offend Gong Yang, thus rejecting the offer for the bet.Gong Yang appeared to have read their thoughts, as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s still possible to have a bet, but not on Qin Nan\u2019s life, as he is sure to survive. Let\u2019s bet if Qin Nan is able to achieve the top five places in the trial!\u201d\\nEveryone was incredibly shocked by the words.Qin Nan achieving the top five spots?Achieving the top five spots after offending Ling ZIxiao and the two hundred and twenty disciples?Is Gong Yang out of his mind?\u201cSenior Brother Gong Yang\u2026\u201dXiao Qingxue blurted out. Even she could not believe Qin Nan would be ranked in the top five; even top ten would be impossible, not to mention top five.She would be satisfied if Qin Nan were able to survive from the Trial of Versatility.\u201cIt\u2019s ok; I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Gong Yang interrupted Xiao Qingxue, and stared directly at the five elders and Mo Li with a sharp gaze, and continued to apply pressure, \u201cSo? I thought you guys look down on him; if that\u2019s the case, why are you guys so afraid to accept my bet? If you guys chose not to participate, then you all have to apologize for your previous words!\u201dAt that instant, Gong Yang completely displayed the aura and prestige as a top ten inner disciple.The five elders and Mo Li\u2019s faces turned cold at the same time.They had no intention to go against Gong Yang, but they did not think that Gong Yang would be so disrespectful, asking them to apologize to Qin Nan.Apologize?No f**king way!The white-haired elder let out a hollow laugh and said, \u201cIf Senior Brother Gong Yang insists so, let\u2019s bet then. I bet that Qin Nan would not be able to acquire a top-five spot, and my stake will be ten thousand Martial Emperor Pills!\u201dMo Li laughed sinisterly, before saying, \u201cI\u2019m not that rich, I\u2019ll bet five thousand Martial Emperor Pills!\u201dThe other elders, all voiced out respectively.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll bet ten thousand Martial Emperor Pills too!\u201d\u201cTen thousand for me too, HAH.\u201d\\n\u2026\u2026Xiao Qingxue and the other disciples were dumbfounded by the scene before them.Martial Emperor Pills, were equivalent to the Body Tempering Pills and the Xiantian Pills. They were specifically used by Martial Emperor cultivators to help with their cultivation.The total stake of the five elders and Mo Li was sixty-five thousand Martial Emperor Pills, a crazy amount of fortune. It was equivalent to six and a half million Xiantian Pills, completely terrifying!Gong Yang\u2019s expression remained unchanged, as he glanced at Xiao Qingxue and said with a gentle tone, \u201cJunior Sister Qingxue, would you like to participate? It is rare to have such a good chance to earn some Martial Emperor Pills.\u201dAfter hearing this, the five elders and Mo Li all laughed hollowly; Earn Martial Emperor Pills? Prepare to lose all your bets!Xiao Qingxue clenched her teeth and said, \u201cI believe in him, I\u2019ll bet four thousand Martial Emperor Pills!\u201dFour thousand Martial Emperor Pills was all of her possessions.Meanwhile, the inner disciples who were standing to the side were excited to see such a grand bet, as their heartbeats raced and their blood started to boil; one of them could not help but ask, \u201cSenior Brother Gong Yang, can we join too?\u201d\u201cSure thing.\u201d Gong Yang smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re all welcome to join.\u201dAfter hearing this, the disciples all placed their bets hurriedly.\u201cI bet a thousand Martial Emperor Pills that Qin Nan can\u2019t acquire a top five spot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bet two thousand Martial Emperor Pills that Qin Nan will fail too.\u201d\u201cTwo thousand Martial Emperor Pills for me.\u201d\u201cDamn it, I did not bring much when I came out. I can only bet five hundred. This is such a good chance to earn some fortune.\u201d\u2026\u2026In a short moment, the total stake betting that Qin Nan could not acquire a top-five spot, had reached a sum of seventy-five thousand Martial Emperor Pills.\\nWhat was worth mentioning was that a Martial Emperor who had just become an inner disciple mistakenly placed five hundred Martial Emperor Pills, betting that Qin Nan would acquire a top-five spot. Although he regretted it instantly, it was impossible to switch his bet in front of the crowd now.\u201cSo there\u2019s a total of four thousand five hundred Martial Emperor Pills on this side.\u201d Gong Yang said with a calm expression, \u201cSince I\u2019m the one who initiated the bet, I will then add seventy thousand, five hundred Martial Emperor Pills on this side.\u201dNo one could remain calm after hearing this.For most of the inner disciples, it was already quite a fortune for them to have one or two thousand Martial Emperor Pills. Even the five elders each possessed at most ten thousand plus Martial Emperor Pills.In contrast, Gong Yang was able to bet over seventy thousand Martial Emperor Pills.However, at that moment, a blinding light flickered from the White Jade Dojo. An enormous golden formation could be seen appearing in the middle.Everyone\u2019s focus was instantly gathered on it.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Well, thank you for Senior Brother Gong Yang\u2019s generosity.\u201dAfter hearing Mo Li\u2019s words, the five elders spoke one after another with pleasant smiles on their faces.\u201cYeah, Gong Yang. It seems like we have the upper hand this time.\u201d\u201cHehe, ten thousand Martial Emperor Pills is all my possession, makes my heartbeat races when I think of it.\u201cTsk tsk, If Qin Nan did achieve one of the top five spots, I won\u2019t feel anguished over my loss at all.\u201d\u2026\u2026The five elders and Mo Li were obscurely mocking Gong Yang.Although they had no idea why on earth Gong Yang was confident enough to bet over seventy thousand Martial Emperor Pills on Qin Nan acquiring one of the top five spots, they still found it impossible for Qin Nan\u2014mere trash with a fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation\u2014to be ranked in the top five after offending Ling Zixiao and the two hundred and twenty disciples.Even though Qin Nan could be considered as one of the top talents with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, it would be impressive enough for him to survive in this Trial of Versatility.The other inner disciples began to chat among themselves after hearing these words.\u201cWhat is Senior Brother Gong Yang thinking this time, to establish such a bet after knowing he would lose for sure.\u201d\u201cWho cares, it\u2019s a good chance to earn some Martial Emperor Pills.\u201d\u201cDamn it, I just bet five hundred Martial Emperor Pills on Qin Nan.\u201d\\n\u201cHAHAHA, you\u2019re certainly mad, betting Qin Nan to acquire a top-five spot under such circumstances? I\u2019m afraid your five hundred Martial Emperor Pills are gone this time.\u201d\u2026\u2026Gong Yang shrugged his shoulders after hearing these words, and let out a smile.In everyone\u2019s opinion, Gong Yang might be out of his mind to set up such a bet, but the truth was otherwise.Previously, when Gong Yang heard that Ling Zixiao had assembled over two hundred disciples to hunt Qin Nan down, he was completely shocked too, and utterly furious. However, Gong Yang knew that Qin Nan had the Great Elder\u2019s badge on him.Following this, Gong Yang began to investigate Qin Nan\u2019s background, and knew that he had come from Lingshui City. There was nothing special about his journey here; hence it was impossible for him to have had any contact with the Great Elder of the Mystic Spirit Sect.Therefore, the question was; why would Qin Nan have the Great Elder\u2019s badge when he only possessed an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, and his cultivation base was only at the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm?The only explanation was that there was some secret which remained hidden to the crowd about Qin Nan, which the Great Elder was fond of.Therefore, together with Gong Yang\u2019s understanding of Qin Nan, he was confident in him.At last, in that instant, an inner disciple said with a low tone, \u201cThey\u2019re out\u2026\u201dOn the White Jade Dojo, in the midst of the formation, a continuous stream of invisible fluctuations could be felt, as over a hundred figures began to slowly come into view.After the figures appeared, the enormous foundation then vanished, returning the place to its calm state.At that instant, the five elders, Gong Yang, Xiao Qingxue, and Mo Li went forward without hesitation and their eyes scanned the crowd of disciples.\\nThey normally would not be so impatient, but as such a grand bet was involved this time that caused their hearts to race, they could not wait to find out the result.\u201cQin Nan!\u201dAfter a quick glance over the crowd, Xiao Qingxue soon detected Qin Nan\u2019s figure at the back. Her beautiful face turned excited immediately, as her attractive figure began to sway from her heavy breathing.The other Martial Emperor disciples were jealous after seeing this; how lucky can this Qin Nan be\u2014to regarded as a brother by Gong Yang, and treated so preciously by Xiao Qingxue.The five elders and Mo Li were startled after hearing this.They did not expect Qin Nan to still be alive.Following it, they all let out a cold humph, so what if Qin Nan survived, he still can\u2019t achieve one of the top ten spots.\u201cHmm?\u201dMo Li frowned his eyebrows as he did not find Ling Zixiao\u2019s figure after scanning the crowd.The five elders frowned their eyebrows too, why is Ling Zixiao not among the three hundred disciples?This caused Mo Li and the five elders\u2019 hearts to sink, as an uneasy feeling rose within them.Mo Li took a deep breath, and his gaze quickly found Xiao Yunhe and his crew. He knew who Xiao Yunhe was, as he was the first person he and Ling Zixiao approached when they planned to recruit people to hunt down Qin Nan.Mo Li did not hesitate further, as he took a step forward and yelled, \u201cXiao Yunhe, what happened, where is Ling Zixiao? Why is he not here?\u201dThe over three hundred disciples who had just arrived at the Mystic Spirit Sect failed to react, as they all stared blankly around.As for Xiao Yunhe, after being questioned by Mo Li all of a sudden, his face went blank before he collected his thoughts after a moment. He moved his lips slightly, but not a single word came out.\\nMo Li\u2019s expression was twisted, as his words were now accompanied with an imperious and interrogating tone, \u201cSpeak! What actually happened? Where is Ling Zixiao?\u201dThe five elders started to panic; Ling Zixiao was a super genius with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, whom the sect would focus on training. If anything happened to him, they were the ones that would take the responsibility.Xiao Yunhe\u2019s eyelids jumped as he took a deep breath, and said with a miserable tone, \u201cSenior Brother Ling Zixiao\u2026 He\u2026 He\u2019s dead.\u201d\u201cWHAT?\u201dAfter hearing this, Mo Li and the five elders had their faces contort completely, as if they were just struck by thunder.Not only them, the other inner disciples, including Gong Yang and Xiao Qingxue, were utterly stunned.Ling Zixiao is dead?How did Ling Zixiao die?When Ling Zixiao entered the Island of Versatility, his cultivation had already reached the ninth-layer Body Tempering Realm, which was sure to improve during the Trial of Versatility. Together with his ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, anyone among the new disciples would have a hard time trying to kill him.Mo Li and the five elders soon recovered from the shock, as their faces turned cold instantly, while emitting powerful auras.Mo Li, in particular, was extremely furious, as Ling Zixiao was the talent discovered by him, the subordinate he trained. Why would he not be angry now that he was killed?With this thought, Mo Li could not hold it back any longer, as his Martial Emperor aura burst out together with his gaze toward Huang Long. He said in a cold tone, \u201cHuang Long, why did you kill Ling Zixiao? It was only a trial between the disciples. Ling Zixiao had a great future ahead of him as a super genius. Why did you kill him?\u201d\\n\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They all wanted to know why Huang Long killed Ling Zixiao.Huang Long was the only one among the new disciples capable of defeating Ling Zixiao.Under Mo Li\u2019s questioning, Huang Long did not appear intimidated; he let out a smile, without answering the question.Apart from that, the over three hundred new disciples who all collected their thoughts now wore strange expressions on their faces after hearing Mo Li\u2019s question.After being ignored by Huang Long, Mo Li was further engulfed by flames of anger, as he emitted a murderous intent.At that moment, Gong Yang began to speak in a calm tone, \u201cJunior Brother Mo Li, don\u2019t be mad. It\u2019s normal for geniuses to die in the Trial of Versatility, and it\u2019s acceptable according to the rules too. Besides that, our bet is the first priority for now. We should see if Qin Nan has acquired a top-five spot in this trial.\u201dThe five elders and the other inner disciples all nodded their heads in agreement. The result of the bet was indeed their main concern for now.After hearing Gong Yang\u2019s words, the new disciples were stunned. Bet? Has Qin Nan acquired a spot in the top five?Mo Li was extremely furious, but he did not lose his mind. Even if Huang Long did slay Ling Zixiao, now was not the time for this, which was why he was incredibly mad. He then responded Gong Yang\u2019s words with a sinister laugh, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of the bet? Trash like Qin Nan getting into the top five in the trial? What an absolute joke!\u201dThe five elders and the other inner disciples began to feel excited.Even though Ling Zixiao being killed was definitely out of their expectation, how could they not be happy as they were about to win a fortune of Martial Emperor Pills?\\nAs for Xiao Qingxue, she did not anticipate Qin Nan would achieve a position in the top five. When she saw Qin Nan returned in one piece, with his cultivation improved to the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, she was extremely satisfied. Even if she ended up losing four thousand Martial Emperor Pills, it was no longer her concern.The white-haired elder who tried to hold his excitement back turned to the crowd and yelled, \u201cXu Qian, come up here at once and declare the top ten participants of the trial.\u201dAfter hearing the words, Xu Qian instantly came forward to the front, and said with a hesitating tone, Elder, the Trial of Versatility this time\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201d The five elders were annoyed, as they rolled their eyes at Xu Qian and said, \u201cXu Qian, since when did you have a habit of dawdling? Hurry up and tell us the results!\u201dAt that instant, Mo Li who was engulfed by his fury blurted out, \u201cXu Qian, just tell us if Qin Nan has acquired a spot in the top five. Just a while ago, Senior Brother Gong Yang bet seventy-five thousand Martial Emperor Pills with us on this trashy Qin Nan achieving one of the top five in the trial!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dXu Qian was astounded. Seventy-five thousand Martial Emperor Pills?Apart from him, the whole crowd of disciples was astonished. A total of seventy-five thousand Martial Emperor Pills!At that instant, the white-haired elder let out a pleasant smile and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Us elders, and some of the disciples bet a total of seventy-five thousand Martial Emperor Pills on Qin Nan not achieving the top five in the trial, so just tell us the result. I\u2019m afraid we will be winning the bet against Junior Brother Gong Yang this time.\u201d\\nAfter hearing this, Xu Qian immediately recovered from his astonishment, with a strange expression appearing on his face.At the same time, all the disciples also began to wear strange expressions on their faces.After inhaling deeply, Xu Qian held the bursting thoughts in his mind, and let out a cough before saying, \u201cElder, I have to say, there were only four people acquiring the Blue Dragon Badges in the Trial of Versatility.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d The white-haired elder raised his eyebrows, although he did not seem to be surprised as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s ordinary for only four people acquiring the Blue Dragon Badges. This happened in previous trials too. If that\u2019s the case, same with how we dealt with it previously, the prizes of the remaining six spots, will be given to those four winners.\u201dAmong the crowd of new disciples, many of them felt like bursting out laughing, but they did not dare to do so, to an extent that some of their faces went red instantly.After sensing the strange atmosphere of the crowd, Gong Yang began to speak, \u201cXu Qian, tell us the result now.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Xu Qian could not help but glance at the five elders and Mo Li, before reading the result out loud, \u201cI was sent by the sect to the Island of Versatility to conduct the test for the new disciples. In the period of a month, Xiao Leng acquired one Blue Dragon Badge, placing him at the fourth rank. Chu Yun acquired two Blue Dragon Badges, placing her at the third rank.

Among the disciples, he was mismatched against the top ten geniuses, not to mention the two super geniuses, Huang Long and Ling Zixiao.How could Qin Nan achieve the first rank under such circumstances?Xu Qian gave the five elders and Mo Li a pitiful look, before he continued to unleash a great explosion, \u201cIn the Trial of Versatility, Qin Nan participated in the trial of the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, and achieved one thousand steps!\u201dBANG!The five elders, Mo Li, Gong Yang, and Xiao Qingxue\u2019s faces were filled with utter astonishment.Reaching the thousandth step in the Mind-Seducing Woods?The step which geniuses of all generations in history failed to accomplish, but Qin Nan did it?At that instant, they all came to a realization. They finally understood why Qin Nan came first!They all knew that by achieving a thousand steps in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods, he would receive twenty Blue Dragon Badges.In that case, it was quite reasonable for Qin Nan to come first.\u201cHAHAHAHA.\u201d Gong Yang was not in shock for long, and reacted first by bursting out laughing joyfully, and saying, \u201cMy brother, I\u2019m so proud of you, being able to achieve a thousand steps.

However, she did not expect Qin Nan to reach the thousandth step and make history, and come first in the Trial of Versatility!Who was able to come first in the Trial of Versatility with an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit?Only Qin Nan!After Gong Yang was done laughing, he glanced at the five elders and Mo Li and let out a hollow laugh, before saying, \u201cFive elders, Junior Brother Mo Li, I\u2019m so sorry. The trash in your views, the miniscule one who you all thought would surely die\u2014not only did he manage to acquire a top-five spot, he even came first, and made history. It seems like you all have to pay me the Martial Emperor Pills!\u201dThe five elders, Mo Li, and the inner disciples were awakened by these words, and all twisted their lips and felt a sudden heartache.They had put in all their possessions into the bet, which contributed to making a sum of seventy-five thousand Martial Emperor Pills!Even with their current positions, it would take them at least a year or two, or some special circumstances, to recover from such a huge loss.Most importantly, as what Gong Yang just said, the Qin Nan who they all looked down on before had achieved such an astonishing accomplishment.It served as a huge slap to their faces, leaving a burning sensation behind.Qin Nan\u2019s result surely surpassed theirs back in the day. What right did they have to mock Qin Nan, to look down on him?\u201cI won? I really won?\u201d Among the disciples, one of them who bet on Qin Nan let out a joyful cry instantly, \u201cHAHAHA, I did win!

Are you f**king kidding me? Why would Ling Zixiao not do anything to Qin Nan? Xu Qian, tell me; who killed Ling Zixiao, was it Huang Long?\u201dThe shriek immediately grabbed the attention of the crowd.Even the five elders, Gong Yang, and Xiao Qingxue frowned their eyebrows, as they were all confused.Ling Zixiao with his team of over two hundred disciples would never allow Qin Nan to come first in the Trial of Versatility without doing anything.What really happened in the trial?Xu Qian glanced at Mo Li and said, \u201cSenior Brother Mo Li, if you really want to know, let me tell you; Ling Zixiao was slain by Qin Nan.\u201d\u201cWHAT?\u201d Mo Li was shocked, before saying, \u201cWhat did you just say? Say that again?\u201dThe five elders, the inner disciples, including Gong Yang and Xiao Qingxue, were all stunned. They all doubted if Xu Qian was speaking the truth.Killing Ling Zixiao, and achieving a thousand steps in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods were two completely different things.One\u2019s Martial Heart was the key to achieve a thousand steps in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods. It was acceptable for Qin Nan to make such a historical accomplishment.However, how did Qin Nan kill Ling Zixiao with his mere cultivation of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm?Before Xu Qian could answer, a calm voice was heard, \u201cIt\u2019s ok, Senior Brother Xu Qian, let me tell him myself.\u201dThe voice belonged to none other than Qin Nan.\\nQin Nan\u2019s figure slowly appeared from the crowd at the White Jade Dojo.Among the huge crowd, the new disciples all moved aside and made way for Qin Nan, respectful expressions on their faces.Qin Nan then made his way and arrived before the five elders, and stared at Mo Li as he said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. The trash in your eyes managed to slay Ling Zixiao with a single attack in the Trial of Versatility.\u201dMo Li was utterly shocked, and he instinctively glanced toward Xiao Yunhe and his group, and saw them all nod their heads in confirmation.BANG!After seeing this, Mo Li felt like he was struck by lightning, causing his mind to explode, and his soul to shiver.Even the five elders, the Martial Emperor disciples, Gong Yang, and Xiao Qingxue all wore blank expressions on their faces.Did Qin Nan really manage to kill Ling Zixiao?How is this possible? How did this happen?However, the over three hundred disciples remained silent on the spot, which further emphasized the validity of the unbelievable truth.Not only was Qin Nan the first one to accomplish the final step, he also defeated the super genius Ling Zixiao, causing an unbelievable miracle to occur.At that instant, everyone glanced at Qin Nan\u2019s slim figure, and felt like they were looking at an incredibly huge mountain before them.The new disciples only understood one thing\u2014after the Trial of Versatility, Qin Nan was going to shine bright like a diamond in the Mystic Spirit Sect!\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At that moment, they were convinced that Qin Nan had the strength to defeat Ling Zixiao.They all knew the incredible power granted to one after achieving the Minor Success Stage of the Arcane Realm.Mo Li opened his mouth wide; the twisted expression on his face was gone, replaced by utter shock.What is going on here? Qin Nan, a miniscule ant, trash, rubbish. How did he achieve the Arcane Realm?Not only that, how did he achieve a thousand steps in the Trial of Versatility?Only now did Mo Li realize the truth.He inhaled deeply, and said with a dull expression on his face, \u201cQin Nan, I have been underestimating you all this time. I never expected that with your mere eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, you\u2019re able to match against the talent and potential of ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit bearers. Despite that, since you\u2019ve killed Ling Zixiao, you and I will be enemies!\u201d\\nAfter saying this, Mo Li clenched his teeth and threw over a hundred jade jars onto the ground before leaving the scene.It would be more embarrassing if he were to stay any longer.\u201cThis Mo Li is definitely a trickier opponent than Ling Zixiao; he managed to hold himself together despite what just happened. I shall not let him get away so easily if I have the chance in the future.,\u201d said Qin Nan to himself, as he glanced at Mo Li\u2019s departing figure, before switching his focus onto the jade jars on the ground.Qin Nan had never seen Martial Emperor Pills before. He instinctively licked his lips upon seeing them for the first time, as he could feel a rich amount of Qi within the pills, which was at least hundred times more than Xiantian Pills.At that instant, Gong Yang recovered from his shock, and took a big step forward and burst out laughing, \u201cFive elders, and my beloved Junior Brothers. Mo Li had already given me the pills, is it now your turn to do so too?\u201dAfter hearing this, the five elders and the inner disciples\u2019 faces contorted immediately.However, they did not dare to ignore the bet; thus, they could only withstand the pain in their heart and take out the Martial Emperor Pills.In a blink of the eye, over a hundred jade jars were placed before Gong Yang; the powerful aura emitting from them caused everyone at the scene to be astonished.\u201cWell, well, well.\u201d Looking at such a large amount of Martial Emperor Pills, even Gong Yang could not help but feel his heart rate increase, as he said in an excited tone, \u201cQin Nan, if it weren\u2019t for your achievement, I won\u2019t be able to win so many pills from the bet. I\u2019ll give some to you after the five elders finish distributing the prizes.\u201d\\nAfter hearing this, Qin Nan raised his head and glanced at the five elders.The white-haired elder figured out Qin Nan\u2019s intention, who forced a smile and said, \u201cFine, let\u2019s give out the prizes for the Trial of Versatility.\u201dUpon saying this, the white-haired elder flicked his finger, emitting a few rays of light, which landed on Huang Long, Xiao Leng, and Chu Yun\u2019s bodies.Following this, the white-haired elder waved his hand, and a jade jar landed before Qin Nan as he advised, \u201cThis is the Nine Rotation Golden Pill. It\u2019s best if you consume it after you\u2019ve reached the Xiantian Realm for the maximum benefit.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dQin Nan nodded his head and took the jade jar without checking its contents.\u201cAccording to the rules of the sect, as you\u2019ve made history by achieving a thousand steps, you\u2019ll be rewarded by the sect.\u201d The white-haired elder continued, \u201cOn behalf of the sect, I now reward you with ten thousand Xiantian Pills, and a storage bag.\u201dAfter saying this, the white-haired elder revealed a purple bag from his chest pocket and gave it to Qin Nan.Upon seeing this, even the inner disciples were astounded, as their faces filled with jealousy.Ten thousand Xiantian Pills were equivalent to a thousand Martial Emperor Pills. Furthermore, the storage bag was even more precious; even inner disciples would not have one themselves.\u201cTen thousand Xiantian Pills, plus a storage bag?\u201dQin Nan was startled, his mind was unable to react in time, as he did not expect to receive such tremendous rewards.At that moment, even with Qin Nan\u2019s firm Martial Heart, it felt like a dream to him.Fortunately, Qin Nan knew that as he was in the limelight of the crowd, he could not expose his feelings too much. He immediately calmed himself down, and received the storage bag with a poker face.\\n\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2014that will be the end of the Trial of Versatility. The outer elders will come and bring you to the outer domain.\u201d After finishing distributing the prizes, the white-haired elder did not waste any more time, and left the place together with the other four inner elders at once.The five elders had no intention to stay any longer, as they had once mocked Qin Nan and were rude to him previously.Not long ago, they almost lost all their possessions as they were looking down on Qin Nan.Therefore, it was obvious how dull they would feel right now.Qin Nan was surprised seeing the elders leaving in such a hurry. He still remembered how rude they were to him before, thus he initially planned to pay them back right here.The disciples were jealous after seeing the rewards, but they did not dare to have any other thoughts.\u201cThis is not the place to talk.\u201d Gong Yang let out a smile and said, \u201cQin Nan, Xiao Qingxue, do come with me.\u201dQin Nan and Xiao Qingxue exchanged glares and could see the joy of reunion in each other\u2019s eyes. The two then followed Gong Yang and vanished from the crowd\u2019s vision.Not long after, in the Mystic Spirit Sect, the news was heard which brought amazement to everyone!In the Trial of Versatility, a disciple named Qin Nan\u2014who possessed an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, and a cultivation of the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm\u2014defeated a super genius with a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit and a tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation!Not only that, this guy named Qin Nan was also the first disciple in history to accomplish a thousand steps in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods!What is the significance of a thousand steps?In the Mystic Spirit Sect, everyone including the sect elders and the disciples had participated in the Trial of Versatility before; thus, they clearly understood the difficulty of the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods.\\nNow that an eighth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit disciple managed to accomplish a thousand steps, why would they not be shocked?At that moment, everyone in the Mystic Spirit Sect took note of Qin Nan\u2019s name instantly.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No one is able to eavesdrop without surpassing the Martial Emperor Realm.\u201dWhile explaining, Gong Yang brought the two of them into a room.The room was not big, around ten meters square wide. It was well decorated, especially the tea set placed on the wooden table. The cups which looked like crystals were arranged in a line, resembling the shape of a dragon.Gong Yang sat on the first seat, and finished brewing a pot of tea with a well-practiced manner in just a short period of time.Xiao Qingxue reached out her elegant fingers and grabbed hold of a cup. She took a sip from it, and glanced at Qin Nan, before saying in a seemingly angry tone, \u201cQin Nan, I never thought you would be so concealing\u2014I was so worried about you.\u201dUpon hearing this, Gong Yang too glanced toward Qin Nan; he was curious to know how his brother continued to make miracles happen.\u201cSenior Sister Qingxue, it\u2019s not my fault,\u201d Qin Nan laughed wryly, \u201cI was being hunted by Ling Zixiao and his group, so I was forced to focus on improving my strength. What I didn\u2019t expect was that I would be lucky enough to have fortunate encounters on the Island of Versatility, boosting my cultivation rapidly.\u201d\\nUpon hearing this, Gong Yang and Xiao Qingxue nodded their heads; they were quite convinced that this was the truth.Qin Nan was only at the fifth-layer Body Tempering Realm before the Trial of Versatility took place, which improved rapidly to the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, in addition to mastering the Minor Success Stage of the Arcane Realm\u2014it was impossible if he did not have any fortunate encounters.Gong Yang let out a smile and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about that. It\u2019s time to split the pills now.\u201dAfter saying this, Gong Yang flicked his finger, and ten jade jars landed before Xiao Qingxue.Xiao Qingxue was slightly shocked, and was going to say something, before Gong Yang held his hand up and said, \u201cYou bet four thousand Martial Emperor Pills, so that means I would need to give you eight thousand in return. I decided to round it off, making it ten thousand in total.\u201dAfter seeing this, Qin Nan stared with his eyes opened wide; he had not expected Gong Yang to have the personality of a wealthy parvenu.Gong Yang then smilingly said to Qin Nan, \u201cQin Nan, it was with all of your contributions that I ended up winning so many pills. Besides that, as your Brother Yang, I shall not mistreat you. Here are thirty thousand Martial Emperor Pills. Feel free to spend it as you will.\u201dAfter saying this, a total of thirty jade jars were placed in an orderly fashion before Qin Nan.Qin Nan and Xiao Qingxue both held their breath after seeing this.A total of thirty thousand Martial Emperor Pills, which was equivalent to three million Xiantian Pills!Qin Nan in particular, was relatively poor; he would have leapt into the air in joy upon receiving a hundred thousand Xiantian Pills. Now that there were thirty thousand Xiantian Pills before him, it caused him to feel like passing out.\\nAfter a while, Qin Nan finally collected his thoughts and let out a wry smile, \u201cBrother Yang, are you planning to scare me to death? You\u2019ve won these Martial Emperor Pills because of your trust in me. I did not do anything unique. Of course, I will be willing to take it as a gift, but I\u2019ll only take ten thousand Martial Emperor Pills.\u201dQin Nan did not hesitate; he waved his hand, taking ten jade jars away.This was even when he was quite covetous of the thirty thousand Martial Emperor Pills, which would allow his Divine Battle Spirit to improve at an unbelievable rate. However, Qin Nan chose to hold his greed back, as he was not supposed to take them all since it was not his contribution.He was only taking the ten thousand Martial Emperor Pills as there was no need to be too polite among brothers, and Gong Yang had won a total of seventy thousand Martial Emperor Pills.Gong Yang\u2019s eyes flickered with a sense of compliment, as he then said, \u201cAlrighty, let\u2019s make it that way. By the way, I\u2019ll have to excuse myself\u2014you two enjoy.\u201dAfter saying this, Gong Yang instantly left the place without any hesitation.This left Qin Nan and Xiao Qingxue speechless.\u201cOh right, Qingxue, I did not use the Escape Orb which you gave me previously,\u201d Qin Nan took the orb out and said with a wry smile, \u201cI did tell you that I wouldn\u2019t need this.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t I worried about your safety?\u201d Xiao Qingxue rolled her eyes at him, and paused for a brief moment, before saying in a soft tone, \u201cThis Escape Orb, you should keep it.\u201dQin Nan was stunned for a moment, before he nodded his head and kept the orb in his pocket.\\n\u201cQin Nan, tell me; how many secrets are you still hiding?\u201d Xiao Qingxue leaned forward and opened her attractive eyes wide, staring straight into Qin Nan\u2019s.It was the first time for Qin Nan to have such close interactions with Xiao Qingxue. He realized how attractive her facial features were\u2014almost flawless\u2014especially her flickering eyes, which absorbed his thoughts.Qin Nan instinctively inhaled deeply, and captured a unique pleasant scent; he could not help but let out a cough, and avoided Xiao Qingxue\u2019s gaze and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any secrets.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Xiao Qingxue was not satisfied hearing this answer.Qin Nan glanced at her and thought for a moment; he then stood up and said, \u201cQingxue, one day, I\u2019ll let you witness them with your own eyes.\u201dXiao Qingxue was stunned for a moment, before her big eyes turned into crescents, as a smile appeared on her face as she said, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll wait.\u201dQin Nan realized the atmosphere was a bit weird, thus he quickly switched the topic, \u201cNow that I\u2019ve received so many pills, I\u2019m planning to go into seclusion and cultivate. What about you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve accepted a task recently, so I\u2019m afraid I have to leave the sect for a while.\u201d A sudden thought came to her, as she gave Qin Nan a death stare and said, \u201cEven the outer domain of the Mystic Spirit Sect is full of talented disciples, you better control your temper.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 Sure, will do.\u201d Upon seeing her expression, Qin Nan felt a sudden headache, as he instantly agreed.\u201cGood, this place is protected by a forbidding aura, you can start cultivating here. I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d Xiao Qingxue did not stay any longer, she turned around and headed straight to the exit, creating a gust of a pleasant scent. Before she stepped out of the door, she glanced back at Qin Nan and said in a low tone, \u201cQin Nan, I\u2019ll wait for you in the inner domain.\u201d\\nAfter saying this, Xiao Qingxue immediately ran off like a terrified rabbit.After seeing such a behavior from her, Qin Nan was quite confused, What happened to her?\u201cScrew it, there\u2019s no point of thinking about it. The most important thing now is to improve the Divine Battle Spirit!\u201d Qin Nan took a deep breath, as his eyes were ignited with flames, \u201cA hundred thousand Xiantian Pills from the sect, plus these Martial Emperor Pills which are equivalent to a million Xiantian Pills, summing up to a total of one million, one hundred thousand Xiantian Pills. I wonder how much you are able to improve?\u201dAfter saying this, nine golden rays appeared swiftly behind Qin Nan, as the Divine Battle Spirit was unleashed.\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At that instant, the imperious aura from the Divine Battle Spirit increased rapidly, and turned utterly terrifying; it was at least a few times more powerful than that of the ninth-grade Huang rank.\u201cTenth-grade Huang ranked, tenth-grade Huang ranked, I finally have a tenth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit!\u201d\\nEven with Qin Nan\u2019s firm Martial Heart, he was incredibly excited at this moment.Tenth-grade Huang ranked was considered a real super genius in the Mystic Sprit Sect, completely outmatching people like Huang Long and Ling Zixiao. Even Gong Yang, who was among the top ten disciples, only possessed a tenth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit.Therefore, this showed how rare and powerful a tenth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit was.\u201cCalm, stay calm.\u201d Qin Nan took a few deep breaths as he thought, \u201cI still have ninety-thousand Xiantian Pills here; with the previous rate, I might have the chance to level up to the legendary Xuan ranked Martial Spirit if I consume all these pills! If that\u2019s not enough, I still have ten thousand Martial Emperor Pills!\u201dXuan ranked Martial Spirit!Only the core disciples in the Mystic Spirit Sect possessed Xuan ranked Martial Spirits, and the count was incredibly low!If Qin Nan were to have a Xuan ranked Martial Spirit, he would become an elite genius of the Mystic Spirit Sect, on par with the most powerful ones in the Mystic Spirit Sect.After having this thought, Qin Nan did not waste any more time as he entered the berserk state once again, shoving handfuls of pills into his mouth continuously.One hour!Two hours!Three hours!After a period of five hours\u2019 time, Qin Nan slowed down his pill consuming actions.The reason was that he had consumed almost sixty thousand Xiantian Pills within these five hours.Even if Qin Nan was relatively wealthy now, to spend sixty thousand Xiantian Pills in one go but for the Divine Battle Spirit to remain motionless, caused him to be slightly doubtful.\u201cI\u2019d like to see how many pills I need to level up to a Xuan ranked Martial Spirit!\u201dQin Nan clenched his teeth, as he once again took a handful of pills and shoved them into his mouth.\\nAnother two hours passed. Within this period, Qin Nan had finished all of his ninety thousand Xiantian Pills.Despite that, the Divine Battle Spirit still remained motionless, as if it were dead.\u201cNinety thousand Xiantian Pills was still not enough to level up; it seems like I will need to use the Martial Emperor Pills\u2026\u201d Qin Nan straightened his face; he did not consume the pills in a crazy fashion this time, but he took ten pills each time, and consumed them slowly.Martial Emperor Pills were different than Xiantian Pills; a Martial Emperor Pill was equivalent to a hundred Xiantian Pills.Time gradually passed; when Qin Nan consumed nine hundred and ninety nine Martial Emperor Pills, the Divine Battle Spirit finally reacted.The golden rays behind the Divine Battle Spirit began to flicker, as an ancient aura burst out from it.After seeing this, Qin Nan felt a sense of seriousness in his mind; he took a deep breath, and shoved a Martial Emperor Pill into his mouth; he then locked his gaze onto the Divine Battle Spirit.As the Divine Battle Spirit consumed the Marital Emperor Pill, a strange occurrence took place, as an ancient voice exploded within Qin Nan\u2019s brain, \u201cThe Divine Battle Spirit fights against the Heaven and Earth; there\u2019s nobody it won\u2019t fight, there\u2019s nothing it won\u2019t win against\u2026\u201dQin Nan\u2019s brain continued to buzz as a thought appeared in his mind, \u201cThe Divine Battle Spirit is not levelling up, it\u2019s evolving a part\u2026\u201dFollowing this, Qin Nan could not withstand the pressure from the voice, causing him to pass out.However, it was quite different than the previous time; Qin Nan did not lose his consciousness, but a mysterious force appeared, dragging his consciousness to a mysterious place.Qin Nan could only see darkness before him, an endless darkness, so dark that one would be terrified, and feel his scalp go numb.\\n\u201cWhat\u2026 What is this?\u201dQin Nan was stunned; it was his first time encountering such a weird scene after he possessed the Divine Battle Spirit.As Qin Nan was feeling confused, a blinding crack appeared among the darkness all of a sudden; following it, a corpse could be seen falling down slowly from the crack.Qin Nan was utterly shocked when he looked at the corpse.The corpse was unbelievably huge, lying horizontally in the darkness; a deadly cold aura was emitted from it, as if it was filled with utter imperiousness.Standing before the corpse, Qin Nan\u2019s size was like one ten-thousandth of a dust particle\u2019s\u2014terrifyingly miniscule.Following this, on the head of the corpse a pair of tightly shut ancient eyes opened slowly; at that instant, a holy light was emitted from them, tearing the endless darkness apart.After seeing this, Qin Nan\u2019s consciousness was sucked in by an arcanic force, causing him to fall into a coma.As he lost his consciousness, he did not see a rare change occurring to the Divine Battle Spirit floating behind him.At that instant, the Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s human figure was encapsulated in a blinding light. It seemed like an invisible pen was slowly drawing the outline of the Divine Battle Spirit\u2019s eyes, which already had an obvious outline from before. Eyes filled with rainbow colors began to appear.When the pair of rainbow colored eyes took shape on the blurry human figure of the Divine Battle Spirit, it felt like the Martial Spirit became alive like a human, a living being.\u201cThe awakening of the Divine Eyes, capturing the Heaven and Earth!\u201dAn ancient voice could be heard, as the Divine Battle Spirit lowered its head slightly; the pair of rainbow colored eyes emitted seven rays of rainbow colors, which felt like seven streams of a river flowing into Qin Nan\u2019s eyes. After the period it takes for an incense to burn, the light vanished, as the colorful eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit turned white.\\n\u2026\u2026At that instant, the fainted Qin Nan had no idea that a mysterious ancient force had combined with his eyes\u2026\u2026\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What on earth could that corpse be?\u201dQin Nan found himself lost in countless doubts after he collected his thoughts.The shock which the corpse gave him was too overwhelming; it felt like the whole Tianfeng Mountain was only the size of a dust particle before the corpse.However, Qin Nan\u2019s thoughts did not linger too long on this; with his current cultivation, it would be impossible to understand the meaning behind the dream. The only thing he was sure of was that there must be some bizarre connections between the corpse and his Divine Battle Spirit.\u201cMost importantly, I should check if the Divine Battle Spirit is any different now.\u201dAfter settling his thoughts, he instantly unleashed the Divine Battle Spirit.Within the ten golden rays, the blurry figure of the Divine Battle Spirit appeared with an incredibly imperious aura; besides that, its pair of white-colored eyes gave itself an extraordinary, ancient, mysterious feeling.After seeing this, Qin Nan was stunned once again.Had the eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit finished evolving?After receiving the eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit previously, Qin Nan figured that with enough consumption of the pills, it was possible to eventually evolve the other parts of the Divine Battle Spirit.However, when Qin Nan saw the eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit for the first time now, he could not help but get lost his thought.\u201cThe eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit have completely evolved; does that mean my eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit possess a more arcane power now?\u201d\\nAs the sudden thought came to Qin Nan\u2019s mind, he could not wait and executed the eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit and looked out from the room.With a glance, he was left speechless in place.The forbidding aura which only Martial Emperors could glance through had no effect on him, and he was able to clearly see everything happening in the building.Many of the inner disciples were chatting while having tea. Some were unleashing their Martial Spirit and cultivating in seclusion. There were also two guys and a girl doing something shameless together.Qin Nan could see everything very clearly, and with ease.At the same time, some furious voices could be heard around the building, \u201cWho\u2019s that? Who\u2019s peeking?\u201dUpon hearing these voices, Qin Nan immediately withdrew his eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, and his heart began racing.He was now sure that, his eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit had improved; his vision now had the ability to bypass any forbidding aura, able to see everything.\u201cWith my current eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, if I were to encounter any forbidding auras, formations, or similar mysterious objects, I would be able to discover its secrets and truths with just a glimpse.\u201d Qin Nan tried to calm himself down as he thought, \u201cWith this ability, I\u2019ll be cruising down my road of cultivation!\u201dAfter having this thought, Qin Nan inhaled deeply, as he gathered himself together.He did not continue to consume the Marital Emperor Pills to try and reach the Xuan ranked Martial Spirit. Instead, he rose and headed for the exit.This was because, after the Trial of Versatility, he had yet to report his arrival at the outer domain. He had spent four days here, thus he must head straight to the outer domain at once.\\nAs for leveling up the Divine Battle Spirit, there was plenty of time for that. Qin Nan was not in a rush to do so.As soon as Qin Nan opened the door, a surprised voice was heard, \u201cYoung Master Qin Nan?\u201dQin Nan glanced toward the voice, and was surprised to find the person to be Bai Heng.Bai Heng said immediately, \u201cYoung Master Qin Nan, I heard from Senior Sister Xiao that you\u2019ve been cultivating in seclusion here, so I\u2019ve been waiting. Don\u2019t you worry about the outer domain, I\u2019ve already helped you with all the procedures. You\u2019re now a real outer disciple, thus you can go back whenever you want.\u201dQin Nan hesitated for a while, before saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve been here all these days?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Bai Heng nodded his head, as he looked around worriedly and said, \u201cNot sure what happened to those inner disciples just then. They all yelled furiously as if they were being peeked at; that scared me\u2026\u201dUpon hearing this, Qin Nan let out a smile; Bai Heng had no idea that the one peeking them was standing right in front of him.\u201cThanks for your help. Here are one hundred Martial Emperor Pills, take them.\u201d Qin Nan held back his unwillingness, as he took the pills out and gave them to Bai Heng.Although back in Lingshui City, there was some conflict between Qin Nan and Ling Zixiao; however, since then, Bai Heng had been behaving well, plus Qin Nan was still new as an outer disciple, and thus he would need Bai Heng\u2019s help to understand everything he needed to know.\u201cOne hundred Martial Emperor Pills?\u201d Bai Heng was shocked, as he quickly waved his hand. Despite that, he was terrified after seeing Qin Nan\u2019s glare, and immediately received the pills as his heart filled with joy; he then said, \u201cThank you, Young Master Qin Nan. Feel free to seek for me if you need anything.\u201d\\nQin Nan smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure where the outer domain is, please bring me there.\u201d\u201cYou want to go back to the outer domain?\u201d Bai Heng was stunned after hearing this.\u201cAny problem with that?\u201d Qin Nan asked.\u201cNo, no, nothing. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d Bai Heng instantly waved his hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I heard there will be an outer domain auction happening at the Treasure Vault. I thought you would be interested, hence why I have been waiting here so I can bring you there. If you want to go back, I\u2019m happy to bring you too.\u201dQin Nan\u2019s eyes flickered with a hint of curiousness as he said, \u201cOuter domain auction? What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cYep, it\u2019s an auction organized by the Treasure Vault, which is only open to outer disciples; there will be lots of treasures there.\u201d Bai Heng glimpsed at Qin Nan\u2019s waist as he then said with a timid tone, \u201cI initially thought that Young Master Qin Nan was looking for a new saber\u2026\u201dAfter saying this, Bai Heng paused his sentence.\u201cInteresting, let\u2019s go to this outer domain auction.\u201d Qin Nan seemed to be interested. He had always wanted to get a new saber all this time, but he did not have the chance to do so.After having this thought, Qin Nan could not help but glance at Bai Heng; this Bai Heng did spend some thoughts on me.Bai Heng was joyful after hearing this as he replied, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll bring you there.\u201d\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It had a luxurious feeling to it, which formed an obvious contrast with the ancient looking Skill Library.The entrance to the Treasure Vault was flooded with endless people, causing the place to be lively.Bai Heng handed Qin Nan a badge and said, \u201cThis is your outer disciple badge. You have to register yourself before entering the Treasure Vault. Keep in mind that outer disciples are only allowed to enter the first floor. Inner disciples are allowed to enter the second and third floors. As for the fourth floor, it\u2019s said to be open only to the core disciples.\u201dQin Nan received the badge, and saw the word \u2018five\u2019 carved on it. Despite that, he did not question it; after registering together with Bai Heng, they both entered the first floor of the Treasure Vault.After stepping into the first floor, Qin Nan\u2019s face was filled with a surprised expression.The hall was fully crowded with people; not only there were stalls set up by the disciples, there were also shops around selling all sorts of weapons and rare materials, as if one had just entered a treasure city.\u201cI never know that the disciples were allowed to set up stalls and sell stuff here on the first floor of the Treasure Vault.\u201dQin Nan thought to himself, as he glanced toward one of the stalls.The owner of the stall was an eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm disciple, whose heart skipped a beat after seeing the auras from Qin Nan and Bai Heng. He quickly let out a smile and said, \u201cTwo Misters, have a look around. These treasures were collected from the ancient ruins, I guarantee they are worth every pill\u2026\u201d\\nQin Nan did not focus on him, but secretly unleashed his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit and scanned every piece of treasure on the stall, to see if there was anything extraordinary.Qin Nan remained expressionless as he withdrew his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, and went toward the other stalls.In the midst of window shopping, Qin Nan continued to scan around with his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, which caused him to be quite surprised, \u201cWhat a treasure vault, the ancient sword there possesses a strong force within it; quite a nice weapon, but it\u2019s too pricey. Not to mention that bronze mirror in that shop, which possesses some secrets, and it might be linked to something else\u2026\u201dQin Nan then shook his head. Despite the fact that his Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit were able to see through the treasures, most of them were too expensive, causing him to lose interest.\u201cEven though with my Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge, I\u2019m allowed to enter the third, or even the fourth floor, but it seems like there\u2019s no need for that.\u201dA thought came to Qin Nan\u2019s mind. Although there were lots of treasures here, they were all too expensive. He planned to use his Martial Emperor Pills to level up his Divine Battle Spirit, thus he was unwilling to spend any of them here.Meanwhile, Qin Nan halted in his track out of a sudden, as his eyes flickered, \u201cHmm?\u201dThe owner of the stall was an outer disciple wearing a black robe, whose cultivation had reached the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm. When he saw Qin Nan and Bai Heng approaching, he said with a calm tone, \u201cYou can observe it, but no touching.\u201dQin Nan nodded his head, as he crouched down and inspected the weird object before him carefully.\\nIt was a stalk of ginseng, but not just an ordinary one. It was totally black in color, with a few rotting spots, as if it was no longer useful.However, with the Eyes of the Divine Battle Spirit, Qin Nan was able to detect a mysterious force enclosed within it, and he could even feel a scarce sense of something alive floating in it.Even with Qin Nan\u2019s knowledge, he could not interpret what kind of force it was; he could only tell that it was extremely powerful.\u201cI\u2019ll buy this ginseng.\u201d Qin Nan was slightly interested, as he rose up and said.The man in black robe glimpsed at him and said, \u201cOne thousand Xiantian Pills.\u201d\u201cOne thousand Xiantian Pills?\u201d Bai Heng was shocked at the words, \u201cThis ginseng is obviously rotting, and you dare to sell it at a price of one thousand Xiantian Pills? Are you robbing us?\u201dThe man replied in a cold tone, \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d\u201cOne thousand Xiantian Pills is it? I\u2019ll give you ten Martial Emperor Pills.\u201dEven though Qin Nan was unwilling, he knew that the ginseng was nothing ordinary through his observation, thus he did not hesitate at all.\u201cHmm.\u201d The man received the Martial Emperor Pills, as his tone softened and said, \u201cIt\u2019s yours now.\u201dQin Nan grabbed the ginseng straight away and put it into his pocket.Bai Heng was stunned throughout the whole purchase. After a while, he could not help but ask, \u201cYoung Master Qin Nan, why did you buy this ginseng? It clearly is rotting. There\u2019s no point buying it at all\u2026\u201dQin Nan smilingly replied, \u201cJust out of curiosity. Plus, it was only ten Martial Emperor Pills.\u201dBai Heng was left speechless, who then exclaimed, Young Master Qin Nan is indeed himself, not regarding the ten Martial Emperor Pills as something precious at all.\\nLittle did he know, that the corner of Qin Nan\u2019s lips had been twitching continuously.\u201cThe outer domain auction is about to start.\u201d Bai Heng blurted out, \u201cLet\u2019s go and sign up, so we could participate too.\u201dQin Nan nodded his head, and arrived at an auction house under Bai Heng\u2019s guidance.The place was crowded with people, a rough estimation of a little over a hundred outer disciples. Many of them had achieved the tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm, quite intimidating and easily noticeable among the crowd.Qin Nan and Bai Heng registered themselves, and paid one hundred Xiantian Pills each as deposits. They then waited patiently for the auction to start.\u201cSo you\u2019re Qin Nan?\u201dAll of a sudden, a prideful voice was heard by the two.This caused Qin Nan to frown his eyebrows, before glancing in the direction of the voice. Before them, a young man wearing a luxurious robe was looking down at him with a scornful face.Although this person\u2019s cultivation was only at the eighth-layer Body Tempering Realm, Qin Nan could easily detect the two disciples beside him possessed tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivations.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Upon seeing the unfriendly approach, Bai Heng stepped forward with a cold expression.\u201cPiss off, none of your business.\u201d The prideful young man glanced at him disdainfully, before staring directly at Qin Nan and saying, \u201cFriend, I\u2019m telling you; I\u2019m Nangong Ershao, brother of Nangong Cheng. Listen to me now, I\u2019m not very fond of you. I\u2019ll not let you join the auction today. If not, you should face the consequences yourself!\u201dAfter saying this, the prideful young man let out a cold humph and raised his head, as his face was filled with a mocking expression.However, after he finished speaking, the crowd around them exploded.\\n\u201cWhat? Nangong Cheng\u2019s brother? Is he really Nangong Cheng\u2019s brother?\u201d\u201cNangong Ershao, I\u2019ve heard of this guy before. He is extremely scornful, and in the past, harassed lots of female disciples, but they were not daring enough to expose him\u2026\u201d\u201cSo disdainful? But with his identity as Nangong Cheng\u2019s brother, it was reasonable that no one dares to confront him.\u201d\u201cSigh, seems like that kid run out of luck.\u201d\u2026\u2026After hearing the words, Bai Heng\u2019s expression changed slightly, as he went up to Qin Nan\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cNangong Cheng is ranked first among the outer disciples within the outer domain. Not only has he a ninth-grade Huang ranked Martial Spirit, his cultivation has reached the half-Xiantian state, and he\u2019s well favored by the First Elder of the outer domain.\u201dQin Nan nodded his head without any expression after hearing this.At that instant, Nangong Ershao could not help but be proud of himself and said, \u201cHow is that, are you scared?\u201dQin Nan glanced at him, as two words came out from his mouth in a cold tone, \u201cF**k off!\u201dThe words served as a sudden thunderclap, which caused every disciple at the scene to be utterly stunned.Translator: XephiZEditor: DOCuinn\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - The Imperious BadgePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100 \u2013 The Imperious BadgeQin Nan had always been ignorant to those who did not offend him. He had never met this Nangong Ershao before, who acted ruthlessly and planned to prohibit him from joining the auction on their first encounter.Therefore, Qin Nan did not show any mercy.Nangong Ershao was slightly startled. It was the first time he was told to \u201cf**k off\u201d after arriving at the Mystic Spirit Sect.The outer disciples around them were shocked, before they burst out talking to each other.\u201cThis guy is so ballsy, doesn\u2019t he know that Nangong Cheng is Nangong Ershao\u2019s brother?\u201d\u201cHmm? This guy looks familiar, I felt like I saw him before, let me recall\u2026 Right, he is Qin Nan. He came first in the Trial of Versatility, the one who achieved a thousand steps in the Mind-Seducing Ancient Bamboo Woods!\u201d\u201cWhat? It\u2019s him?\u201dThe crowd of disciples was more excited after discovering Qin Nan\u2019s identity.\u201cTsk, tsk, who would expect Nangong Ershao to have a conflict with Qin Nan.\u201d\u201cHehe, I\u2019ve heard quite some stories about this Qin Nan. It looks like there will be a good show here today.\u201d\u201cI feel like this Qin Nan is going to be unfortunate, as he offended Nangong Ershao; ordinary people could not face the consequences.\u201d\u2026\u2026Among the disciples, many of them started to shake their heads and mock Qin Nan, as they did not think he would have any chance.They did not witness the events which took place in the Trial of Versatility; they had only heard some rumors about it.Nangong Ershao collected his thoughts swiftly, as his prideful face turned red with anger while he yelled, \u201cQin Nan, you\u2026\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Qin Nan interrupted him straight away, as a cold expression could be seen in his eyes before he said, \u201cNangong Ershao, I had no conflict with you whatsoever, and you plan to stop me from joining the auction. Do you think I\u2019m someone to be bullied like that? I don\u2019t want to waste any time with you, if you have the balls, fight me at the Hall of Life and Death!\u201d\\nQin Nan spoke rapidly, like a chain of bullets firing from his mouth.The crowd of disciples and Nangong Ershao was completely stunned after hearing this, and lost the ability to talk.No one knew how long had passed, before Nangong Ershao reacted with a cold expression and said, \u201cI have to admit that I\u2019m not your opponent in terms of cultivation. However, if you could not understand the current situation, I\u2019ll let you see my influence, to stop you from joining the auction!\u201dAfter saying this, Nangong Ershao let out a hollow laugh and waved his right hand. An old man in a black robe who had been waiting for a long period approached them immediately and gave him a bow.\u201cAdministrator, this guy was the one who spoke ruthlessly, messing up the order here. In my opinion, this trash should not be allowed to join the auction.\u201d Nangong Ershao said. In his words, it felt like Qin Nan had turned into an unforgivable culprit.\u201cWhat? This guy is the one?\u201dThe old man played a nice job cooperating, as he let out a shocked expression and turned toward Qin Nan before saying in a cold tone, \u201cI\u2019m the person in charge of the Treasure Vault\u2019s first-floor. I now ban you from joining the auction, and entering the Treasure Vault in a month\u2019s time; if not, you will have to face the punishments according to the sect\u2019s rules.\u201dThe disciples exploded after seeing this.They were not dumb; it was obvious that Nangong Ershao colluded with the person in charge to deal with Qin Nan.\u201cHehe, it looks like Qin Nan has lost his ground this time.\u201d\u201cThis lad is still new to the Mystic Spirit Sect; he has no idea how tricky this Nangong Ershao is.\u201d\u201cIt seems like Nangong Ershao has the upper hand\u2026\u201d\\nThese outer disciples were excited to witness this, as they all voiced out to express their thoughts.\u201cPerson in charge is it?\u201d Qin Nan remained calm, as he took out a badge from his pocket and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve got an elder\u2019s badge here. I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t have the right to punish me.\u201dUpon seeing Qin Nan\u2019s action, the old man and Nangong Ershao glanced toward the badge at the same time.After a while, the person in charge burst out laughing, \u201cHAHAHA, where did you get this badge from? I\u2019ve never seen it before. Qin Nan, you dare to pretend that you have an elder\u2019s badge, which is a far more serious offense. If you don\u2019t leave here at once, I\u2019ll handle you myself according to the sect\u2019s rules!\u201dThe old man looked scornfully after finishing his sentence.As the person in charge of the Treasure Vault, he had no doubt heard rumors about Qin Nan, but he chose not to believe it, not to mention the fact that Nangong Ershao was Nangong Cheng\u2019s brother, who had a great future lying ahead. Therefore, he decided to collude with Nangong Ershao, so he would have a chance to fawn upon Nangong Cheng.As for Nangong Ershao, the reason he wanted to find trouble with Qin Nan, was because of a lady named Chu Yun.Among the outer disciples, everyone knew how ruthless this Nangong Ershao was. He had the hobby of hooking up with the female disciples, thus when he first saw Chu Yun, he was stunned by her beauty, and approached her with some pickup lines. Despite that, he was completely ignored by Chu Yun.This caused Nangong Ershao to feel agitated. After a worthwhile investigation, he realized that Chu Yun was fond of Qin Nan.As a result, Nangong Ershao was not feeling cordial about this Qin Nan.\\n\u201cYou don\u2019t recognize this badge?\u201d Qin Nan was slightly startled. He did not expect this old man to not recognize the Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge.\u201cHumph, are you trying to confuse me with a random badge? You guys, capture this culprit with me at once!\u201d The old man yelled out. Following it, around ten guards with tenth-layer Body Tempering Realm cultivation appeared and approached Qin Nan in a surrounding formation.The disciples were even more excited. They did not expect to see some action straight away.However, at this moment, a loud imperious voice could be heard, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dThe crowd immediately discovered a middle-aged man approaching them at a steady pace, while emitting an imperious aura.Everyone\u2019s expression changed upon seeing this person.\u201cElder.\u201d The person in charge was shocked, who went up to him and said immediately, \u201cElder, this disciple named Qin Nan dares to fake an elder\u2019s badge. His action is an offense toward the sect\u2019s rules.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d The man let out a curious expression. As the first floor elder of the Treasure Vault, he had no doubt heard of Qin Nan\u2019s name before, as he said in a calm tone, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, he should be punished according to the sect\u2019s rules. The badge, where is it?\u201d\u201cElder, this is it\u2026\u201dThe person in charge immediately held the Scarlet-Fanged Purple Dragon Badge in his hand and showed it to the middle-aged man.The middle-aged man initially planned to take a quick glance, but his face was contorted thoroughly from just a glimpse, as he blurted out, \u201cThis\u2026 This is\u2026\u201dThe old man, Nangong Ershao, and every disciple were stunned. Why does this elder appear to be losing his mind?\u201cYou goddamn bastard, how could you not recognize this badge!\u201d The middle-aged man collected his thoughts, as veins popped out on his forehead as he said furiously, \u201cI have really gone blind, since when did the Treasure Vault have a useless piece of shit like you? Get out of my sight at once, and don\u2019t ever step inside the Treasure Vault again!\u201d\\nThe old man was dumbfounded upon seeing this.What\u2019s going on?Why did the elder just tell him to leave?Why is this happening?Not only was the old man was shocked, even Nangong Ershao and the crowd were utterly startled.\u201cWhat? Do you want me to take action myself?\u201d The middle-aged man stared with an icy glance, as a murderous intent was emitted.\u201cI\u2026\u201d The person in charge completely lost his mind; without any time to think, he immediately blurted out, \u201cI\u2019ll leave, I\u2019ll leave, Please don\u2019t do it\u2026\u201dWhile saying this, the old man rushed toward the exit at an incredible speed, leaving the crowd speechless with their eyes and mouths wide open.Translator: XephiZEditor: DOCuinn\\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
