Its bright moonlight shined down on the ground, making the surroundings seem not so dark.By now, the streets were quite quiet because most people had already fallen asleep. However, a delicate looking youth was walking on the streets, dragging his weary body back home.This youth was called Zhao Fu, and he had taken his mother\u2019s surname. He was twenty-one years old and a second-year student at Nanshi University. He was currently working while studying. For convenience\u2019s sake and because his night job earned him quite a bit of money, Zhao Fu did not live on campus at his university, and he instead rented a room outside.As a lowly commoner, Zhao Fu\u2019s thinking was very simple. He did not have any lofty ambitions or great ideas. He just wanted to find someone who he could spend his life with and live a peaceful life \u2013 that would leave him extremely satisfied.Zhao Fu continued walking along the street. Right now, all he wanted was to have a good night\u2019s sleep.Suddenly, a dark figure rushed out from a corner, slamming Zhao Fu against a wall and pressing a fruit knife against his neck.Feeling the icy blade pressed against his neck, Zhao Fu\u2019s body froze, his hairs standing on end. He did not dare to move at all because he knew that the person might not hesitate to kill him if he moved rashly.Luckily, he had forgotten his phone today, and he did not have anything valuable on him. All he had was $36.50, and if he had to choose between the money and his life, he would not hesitate to choose the latter.Zhao Fu obediently took out all of his money, $36.50, and smiled stiffly. \u201cBig bro! This is all I have, please take it.\u201d\u201cWho wants your money? Turn around, press yourself against the wall, and take off your pants,\u201d the man shouted, dashing Zhao Fu\u2019s hopes of paying him off to save his life.\u201cEh? Turn around, press myself against the wall, and take off my pants?\u201d Zhao Fu frowned and looked over. The lewd-looking middle-aged man started to unbutton his own pants.\u201cFudge! This isn\u2019t a robbery; this is a rape!\u201d Zhao Fu inwardly cursed.At this moment, the lewd-looking middle-aged man waved his knife and said threateningly, \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? Your elder said to take off your pants.\u201d\u201cIs my \u2018chrysanthemum\u2019 going to be torn today?\u201d Zhao Fu shuddered as he frowned, thinking about how he could escape.BOOM!!!At this moment, a deafening explosion sounded out from above. Zhao Fu, who was pressed against the wall, raised his head in surprise.The entire sky seemed to be burning, turning into a massive sea of flames. Countless rainbow lights fell from the sky with long tails trailing behind them, making them look like meteors as they descended.This shocking scene not only grabbed Zhao Fu\u2019s attention but also the lewd-looking middle-aged man\u2019s attention as well. Zhao Fu took advantage of this to grab the man\u2019s wrist, and he twisted with all of his might.\u201cArghh!\u201dThe lewd-looking middle-aged man cried out in pain, his knife falling to the ground. Following this, Zhao Fu brought his knee up and kicked the man\u2019s groin.\u201cArghhhhh!!!!\u201dThe man screamed again as he collapsed to the ground, his face a mask of pain. He arched his body with both hands covering that area. Zhao Fu was still feeling quite angry, and he continuously kicked the man a few times before quickly running away.Bang!!Just as Zhao Fu was running out from this street, a rainbow-colored meteor crashed in front of him. The blinding light caused Zhao Fu to instinctively use his hands to cover his face. After the light disappeared, a crystal that was one finger length in length and two finger lengths in width silently floated two meters above the ground.Zhao Fu curiously walked forwards and held the crystal. The floating crystal did not react at all as Zhao Fu grabbed it.By now, everyone who had been sleeping had been woken up by the loud sounds. They all opened their doors and windows and looked at the countless floating crystals, and began to madly rush out. They all started to fight over these crystals because they looked quite valuable.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing this chaotic scene, Zhao Fu did not stay around and hurried home.Within his single room apartment, Zhao Fu carefully examined the crystal. From its appearance, no gemstone could compare to it, and if it was rare enough, it could be worth cities. However, a countless number of these crystals had descended from the sky, at least a few billion, so they definitely wouldn\u2019t be worth much.Suddenly, the crystal shined with a rainbow glow as a robotic voice said, \u201cHost has been detected to be a Basic Intelligence Lifeform, Soulbinding commencing\u2026\u201d\u201cDing! Soulbinding has been successfully completed; you will now head to the Heaven Awaken World.\u201dAfter hearing this, Zhao Fu\u2019s vision darkened as he fell to the ground.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

You have two imperial bloodlines within you. One is the Great Tang Imperial Family\u2019s bloodline, and the other is the Great Qin Imperial Family\u2019s bloodline. Please select which bloodline you would like to take the Legacy Trial for.\u201d\u201cWarning! The Legacy Trial can only be attempted once, and upon failure, all qualifications to inherit a legacy will be made void.\u201d\u201cLegacy Trial? Great Tang Imperial Family bloodline? Great Qin Imperial Family bloodline?\u201dAt this moment, Zhao Fu was standing in a gray, foggy area. When he heard that announcement, he felt quite confused because he had no idea what was going on. He remembered that he had been holding the crystal before he fainted, and was in this space when he had woken up.Even though he didn\u2019t know what a Legacy Trial was, when Zhao Fu heard \u2018Great Tang Imperial Family bloodline,\u2019 he couldn\u2019t help but grit his teeth and clench his fists. He would never forget what happened on that rainy day even until he died, and was filled with hatred and disgust towards that bloodline.From what he knew, the Li family was a descendent of the Great Tang Imperial family, so the Great Qin Imperial Family\u2019s bloodline was definitely from his mother. As such, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t hesitate to choose the Great Qin Imperial Family bloodline.\u201cSelection complete!\u201dA one hundred meters or so tall altar slowly appeared in front of Zhao Fu. The altar was made of black stones, and each step was about twenty-five centimeters high and half a meter wide. The altar seemed to extend up into the clouds, giving off an ancient, majestic, and dignified feeling.When Zhao Fu stepped onto the first step, he felt his body become heavy as a pressure weighed down on him. In the beginning, the pressure was not very great, but as he advanced step after step, the pressure pressing down on him became more and more intense.By the time Zhao Fu had climbed up half of the altar, his body was covered with sweat, drenching him completely. He was barely able to stand firmly on the steps, and he swayed as if he was going to fall.However, Zhao Fu gritted his teeth and continued, walking step by step up the altar. Soon, illusions started to appear. Some were incredibly beautiful women doing their best to entice him, followed by other illusions of power and money.These illusions may have caused normal people to have chased after them, making them unable to extract themselves from them, but Zhao Fu\u2019s cold heart was completely unaffected.Finally, after much effort and hardship, Zhao Fu finally stood on the top of the altar. His mind felt empty and clear when countless images started to flash before his eyes, all of which were related to the Great Qin Empire\u2019s beginning, rise, and downfall.The scenes started to play before his eyes like a movie, starting from the Qin family\u2019s ancestor \u2018Qin Feizi.\u2019 He was a skilled horse breeder who gained the favor of the King of Zhou and was given a small piece of land on which he established his fief.Then, there were scenes of \u2018King Ying Zheng of Qin\u2019 destroying the six states in ten years, unifying China, and establishing the \u2018Qin Dynasty.\u2019In the end, King Ying Ziying of Qin surrendered to Liu Bang, resulting in the end of the Qin Dynasty.Zhao Fu stared at the scenes, feeling as if he was right there. The rise of Great Qin caused his blood to boil, while the fall of Great Qin caused him to feel desolation.Suddenly, Zhao Fu felt as if his blood was burning, and it was as if there was a fire that was causing his entire body to erupt in flames. This feeling came from within and spread outwards, but it was not painful. Rather, it felt quite warm and comfortable and was as if he was bathing in a hot spring during winter.Following this, Zhao Fu slowly opened his eyes.A figure appeared before him. He was wearing a black-gold dragon gown and gave off a dignified and imposing aura. He stood with his hands behind his back, his eyes seeming to look down on everything under the heavens. He gave off an air of invincibility and seemed quite domineering. He was the First Emperor of Qin\u2026 Ying Zheng!Ying Zheng examined Zhao Fu before faintly smiling and saying, \u201cI\u2019ll leave Great Qin in your care!\u201dAfter saying this, Qin Zheng\u2019s figure slowly disappeared, and a magic cube glowing with a violet light appeared at the center of the altar.Even though Zhao Fu had guessed something like this would happen, he still felt slightly shocked. His bloodline belonged to the Great Qin Empire that had ended the Warring States period. Now, he was responsible for making this empire rise again.After thinking for a moment, Zhao Fu walked forwards and grabbed the violet cube. After a dizzying feeling, he appeared in a forest.The trees in this forest were dense and tall, and the tallest ones were hundreds of meters tall and more than ten meters wide. The leaves growing on the trees were able to completely block out the sun.Even though it was still daytime, there was not much sunlight where Zhao Fu was. Moreover, these trees had strange shapes \u2013 some looked like humans, while others looked like beasts. Some of their expressions were ones of struggling, while others had painful or savage expressions. Adding on how dark it was, this forest seemed quite horrifying.Zhao Fu had never expected that he would appear in such a place. After obtaining the legacy, he had obtained some information. Zhao Fu looked at his attire: he was wearing clothes made of coarse hemp and had cloth shoes. That was all he had.Zhao Fu then opened his stats interface the way that the system announcement had told him.Name: Zhao FuTitle: NoneProfession: NoneAchievement Points: Commoner (0/200)Race: HumanAge: 21 (100)Stats: Strength: 5, Intelligence: 8, Constitution: 4, Agility: 6Cultivation: Stage 0Cultivation Technique: NoneSkills: NoneEquipment: Coarse Cloth Clothes, Cloth Shoes, Coarse Cloth PantsAfter looking at his stats, Zhao Fu found that his Strength and Constitution were fairly low. His current stats were based on his body and mind in the real world. In the real world, the more exercise he did, the better his body would be, resulting in better stats. Conversely, the weaker he was, the lower his stats would be.The world he was currently in was called the Heaven Awaken World, and it was tens of times larger than earth. Only Zhao Fu\u2019s soul had entered this world, while his real body was still in the real world, similar to the situations in virtual reality novels.The Heaven Awaken World\u2019s time was different to the time in the real world. A single day in the real world was equivalent to three days in here, and he would not truly die after dying in this world. Rather, he would not be able to enter this world for ten days and would lose all of his levels, equipment, and skills.What was important to note was that this world was not safe \u2013 other than the human race, there were countless other races and terrifying magic beasts.Normally, he would have been sent to the system\u2019s main city after entering the Heaven Awaken World. However, because of the Legacy Trial, Zhao Fu was not sent to a main city.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFollowing this, Zhao Fu quickly found a concealed mountainous region, took out the violet cube, and pressed it against the ground. A system announcement immediately sounded out, \u201cWould you like to use the Legacy Stone?\u201dZhao Fu immediately replied, \u201cYes!\u201dRipples of light started to come out from the violet cube before a formless energy covered the surrounding 1 square kilometer area. In the next second, all of the trees, grass, and flowers disappeared, revealing flat and smooth ground.Buildings started to slowly appear. There was a thatched cottage with two rooms and the name [Village Hall] above the cottage. There was another thatched cottage with a furnace and a flag hanging outside it with the name [Smithy] above the cottage. There was also a thatched cottage with many simple clothes inside it with the name [Tailor Shop] above the cottage, as well as a thatched cottage called the [Medicine Shop] with all sorts of bottles filled with medicine.There was also a round stage made from bricks with the name [Origin], and another thatched cottage with five stone steles and the name [Profession Change].Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The two people standing at the front were both youths. One had a cold and handsome appearance, while the other looked refined and cultured.Behind them were two men and one woman. One of the men was well-built and muscular, looking like a blacksmith, while the other was dressed like an apothecary. The woman was quite pretty, and she was most likely the owner of the Tailor Shop.\u201cWe greet Your Majesty!\u201dThe five people looked quite dazed after appearing, but they quickly came to their senses and half-knelt as they spoke in unison.Zhao Fu was naturally the lord of Great Qin now that he had received the Great Qin\u2019s legacy, so he calmly replied, \u201cAll rise!\u201dThe five people respectfully stood up.Zhao Fu started to look at their stats, starting with the cold and handsome-looking youth in front.Name: Bai QiGrade: SSSTitle: [God of Killing], Title Effects: All stats +10% and causes enemies to feel fear, reducing their battle strength and increasing his own troops\u2019 morale.Profession: [General], Profession Effects: Can hold two different military professions.Achievement Points: Commoner (0/200)Race: HumanAge: 24 (100)Loyalty: 100Stats: Strength: 10, Intelligence: 10, Constitution: 10, Agility: 10Cultivation: Stage 0Cultivation Technique: NoneSkills: NoneEquipment: Coarse Cloth Clothes, Cloth Shoes, Coarse Cloth PantsEven though Zhao Fu had expected to see the Great Qin\u2019s strategic experts and powerful generals, Zhao Fu still felt quite surprised when he saw Bai Qi. Bai Qi was the strongest of the Four Great Generals of the Warring States period, and he had fought in countless battles during his lifetime, winning almost all of them. He had killed over one million people in his lifetime, so he was called the God of Killing.However, his end was not pleasant \u2013 he was forced to commit suicide out of fear of him joining another state.After looking at Bai Qi\u2019s stats, Zhao Fu turned to look at the refined and cultured youth.Name: Li SiGrade: SSTitle: [Prime Minister], Title Effects: Raises Popular Support, Population Attraction +5%, chances of attracting higher grade population +5%Profession: [Civilian Court Official], Profession Effects: Can choose one type of military profession, Intelligence +2%, Constitution +2%Achievement Points: Commoner (0/200)Race: HumanAge: 23 (100)Stats: Strength: 6, Intelligence: 10, Constitution: 5, Agility: 4Cultivation: Stage 0Cultivation Technique: NoneSkills: NoneEquipment: Coarse Cloth Clothes, Cloth Shoes, Coarse Cloth PantsAfter looking at Li Si\u2019s stats, Zhao Fu did not feel as shocked. Li Si was a famed Prime Minister of the State of Qin, and he had greatly helped the First Emperor of Qin unify China. However, his end was not very pleasant either \u2013 he was charged with treason and was executed by waist chop.Following this, Zhao Fu looked at the other 3 people. They were:Wang Dawu, Profession: Blacksmith, Skills: Forging (can create weapons)Zhang Baizhu, Profession: Apothecary, Skills: Healing (can heal sicknesses)He Yun, Profession: Tailor, Skills: Tailoring (can create defensive items)All three people were S grade, and their other stats were not so important. In the Heaven Awaken World, grade was of paramount importance. There were nine grades in total, and they were, from highest to lowest: SSS, SS, S, A, B, C, D, E, and F.The higher one\u2019s grade was, the faster his or her cultivation and comprehension would progress. E grade was two times faster than F grade, D grade was four times faster than F grade, C grade was eight times faster than F grade, B grade was sixteen times faster than F grade, and so on.Military forces also had grades, and they were also split from F to SSS. However, there were 3 sub-grades for each grade, such as F-, F, and F+.After looking at their stats, Zhao Fu asked them to wait before he entered one of the rooms in the Village Hall, where the violet cube was silently floating in the air. He then looked at the Village\u2019s stats.Village Name: Great Qin Village (Legendary)Level: Primary (0/5000)Village Area: 1 square kilometerVillage Territory: 46 square kilometersResidents: 6/1100Soldiers: 0/440 (Every Village has a population and soldier limit. Most Normal grade Primary level Villages have a limit of 300 people, Blue grade Villages have a limit of 400 people, Silver grade Villages have a limit of 600 people, Gold grade Villages have a limit of 800 people, and Legendary Villages have a limit of 1000 people.)Currently, it displayed that the limit was 1,100 residents because 100 residents were from the Village\u2019s special stats, while the military limit of 440 was the number of residents that had a military profession.Popular Support: 100 (Popular Support refers to the loyalty of residents. If Popular Support is at least 80, the Village will attract more people. If Popular Support is 0, residents will start to betray and flee. When Popular Support is negative, criminals will be attracted. Those people will of course not be loyal, and they must be continuously monitored or lives could be lost.)Because the 5 residents in the Village were all given to Zhao Fu by the system and they had a Loyalty of 100, Popular Support was also 100.Village Special Stats: Territory Crop Output +30%, Territory Crop Growing Time -30%, Population Limit +10%, Residents\u2019 stats can randomly +1, Soldiers\u2019 stats +1%, Population Attraction +20%, chances of attracting higher grade population +20%Subsidiary Village Limit: 4 (Subsidiary Villages receive 10% of the special stats from the Main Village. Normal Villages cannot have Subsidiary Villages, and they need to be raised to Intermediate Villages before they can have any. Blue grade Villages can have one Subsidiary Village, Silver grade Villages can have two Subsidiary Villages, Gold grade Villages can have three Subsidiary Villages, and Legendary Villages can have four Subsidiary Villages.)After looking at the Village\u2019s stats, Zhao Fu felt that his Village was quite powerful. However, it was a pity that it was not the only one because the Qin Dynasty was not the only dynasty to exist in China\u2019s thousands of years long history.There were the Three Holy Dynasties: Xia, Shang, and Zhou; the Seven Powerful States of the Warring States period: Qi, Chu, Qin, Yan, Zhao, Wei, and Han; the Chu-Han Contention: Chu and Han; the Three Kingdoms: Wei, Shu, and Wu; the Five Dynasties: Later Liang, Later Tang, Later Jin, Later Han, and Later Zhou; the Ten Kingdoms: Wu, Wuyue, Min, Chu, Southern Han, Former Shu, Later Shu, Jingnan, Southern Tang, and Northern Han.There were countless dynasties and kingdoms, and even though there were many forces that had unified a country, there were not that many legendary-level ones, and this was only China \u2013 there were many other countries as well.At the same time, enmity and hatred would also be passed down with the legacies, such as Qi, Chu, Yan, Zhao, Wei, and Han hating Qin.The six states destroyed by Qin would definitely have vowed to destroy Great Qin, and this sort of hatred was simply irreconcilable and unforgettable. It was something that would only disappear when one side was destroyed.Great Qin also had hated foes such as Great Han and Great Chu, who destroyed Great Qin.All of these chaotic forces from history would now appear in this world at the same time.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere were also normal people who could develop their own City by obtaining a City Heart or by conquering a Village. Adding on the countless other races, one could only imagine how cruel, bloody, and dark the future would be.Zhao Fu took a deep breath, putting all of this out of his mind. He walked out of the Hall, taking the five people to the Origin. This round stage made from bricks was where new residents would come from.Normal grade Primary level Villages were only able to summon one to four new villagers every day; Blue grade Villages could summon three to six, Silver grade Villages could summon five to eight, Gold grade Villages could summon seven to ten, and Legendary Villages could summon nine to twelve. Because of the Village\u2019s special stats and Li Si\u2019s Title bonus, the village had a 25% bonus to Population Attraction, so the Great Qin Village could summon eleven to fifteen people in a day.Zhao Fu waved his hand toward the Origin, and new villagers started to be summoned. thirteen figures slowly appeared: eight males and five females. Some were elderly, while others were children.The new villager\u2019s Loyalty was not very high: it was around 60. As such, the Popular Support fell from 100 to 70 when the people were summoned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123As for their grades, Normal grade Primary level Villages usually summoned F grade villagers and one E grade villager every three days, one D grade villager every 12 days, one C grade villager every 48 days, one B grade villager every 192 days, and one A grade villager every 768 days, while S grade and above villagers simply couldn\u2019t be summoned in Normal Villages.From this, one could see how rare high-grade villagers were. If it took more than two years to summon an A grade villager, it would be essentially impossible for a Normal Village to summon S grade villagers or above.This was how long it took to summon certain villagers for Normal Villages. The time was reduced by 2/3 for Blue Villages, another 2/3 for Silver Villages, and so on.Most of the villagers summoned at Violet Legendary grade Villages were F grade, some were E grade, a few were D grade, and very few were C grade. Higher grades required more than 2 days, but adding on the Great Qin Village\u2019s special stats and Li Si\u2019s Title\u2019s effect, the Great Qin Village had a 25% bonus to attracting higher grade population, so it would take a bit more than a day for the Great Qin Village to summon higher grade villagers.Out of the thirteen summoned villagers, one was C grade, two were D grade, three were E grade, and seven were F grade.After this, Zhao Fu brought Bai Qi and six of the youths who had decent fighting power to the five stone steles. The five stone steles were Profession Change Stone Steles, and four of them could be used to change one\u2019s profession to a certain profession.[Great Qin Soldier]: E grade Military. Description: The Great Qin Soldiers who swept across and destroyed the other six states. Effects: Every soldier who changes professions will receive the basic cultivation technique [Great Qin Mantra].That was the introduction to the Great Qin Soldiers, and the different professions were as follows:The first was Infantry, which could choose [Sabermen], [Swordsmen], or [Spearmen].After changing professions, Infantry could obtain profession-specific skills. For example, [Sabermen] received the skill [Basic Saber Technique] and the Infantry profession bonus of Strength +2% and Constitution +2%.The second was Shieldbearer, which could choose [Saber and Shield Soldier] or [Spear and Shield Soldier]. They received the skill [Shield Defence] and the Shieldbearer profession bonus of Strength +1% and Constitution +3%.The third was Archer, which could choose [Sword Archer] or [Dagger Archer]. They received the skill [Basic Archery Technique] and the Archer profession bonus of Strength +2% and Agility+2%.The fourth was Cavalry, which could choose [Saber Cavalry], [Sword Cavalry], or [Spear Cavalry]. They received the skill [Horsemanship] and the Cavalry profession bonus of Strength+2%, Constitution+1%, and Agility+1%.The fifth was not a battle profession but a Scholar Profession Change Stone Stele, which allowed 10 people to change their profession to Scholar. They received the skill [Research] and the Scholar profession bonus of Intelligence +4%.The amount of Scholars was limited to 10 at most, and they conducted all sorts of research, such as agriculture, which increased production, animal husbandry, which allowed one to tame wild beasts, and brewing, which allowed one to make good wine.Of course, the higher grade Scholars were better. As such, Zhao Fu did not plan on changing anyone\u2019s profession to Scholar today. Because the village had just been established, he had 50 free profession changes. After 50 profession changes, he would only be able to change professions by paying the corresponding number of copper coins.Zhao Fu changed the six villagers he had brought to Infantry. Zhao Fu regarded Bai Qi as quite important, so he turned and asked, \u201cBai Qi, what profession do you want? You can choose for yourself.\u201dHearing this, Bai Qi nodded. Because Generals could choose 2 professions, he chose Cavalry and Infantry.Zhao Fu also chose Infantry. He did not like using sabers or spears, so he chose Swordsman and received [Basic Sword Technique] as well as the [Great Qin Mantra]. It is only possible to cultivate using cultivation techniques, and his current cultivation was only Stage 0, which he could only raise by cultivating.Cultivation was split into nine Stages, and each Stage was split into nine Steps. Every time one advanced a Step, he or she received +1 to all stats.Only by having a Legendary Village would one be able to obtain the corresponding cultivation technique and have such comprehensive military professions.If it was a Normal Village, they would only be able to change to F- grade [Militiamen] at the beginning, and would have to obtain their own cultivation techniques.There were wheat seeds in the Village Hall, some simple farming tools, ironware, and weapons in the Smithy, clothes in the Tailor Shop, and basic medicines in the Medicine Shop. Zhao Fu arranged for the women to go and pick wild fruits and berries, while the men were to cut wood and build houses and fences. After settling down, they could start clearing wild areas for farming.At this moment, when Li Si saw that Zhao Fu was also going to cut wood, he quickly called out, \u201cYour Majesty! Please rest; how could we allow Your Majesty to do such heavy jobs.\u201dEveryone heard this and looked quite worried that Zhao Fu would tire himself out.When Zhao Fu saw this, his cold heart finally started to relax, and he slightly smiled as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me; just treat me as a friend or a family member.\u201dWhen Li Si heard this, his expression tightened. Zhao Fu was the Great Qin Empire\u2019s inheritor, and he would one day be an Emperor. How could he treat him as a friend? That was blasphemy. However, just as he was about to say something, Zhao Fu cut in front of him. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s getting late, so let\u2019s go cut wood!\u201dLi Si didn\u2019t dare to say anything, but his respect towards Zhao Fu increased.After working for a while, they finally built a few wooden houses and some simple fences. Without knowing it, the 13 resident\u2019s Loyalty all increased by 10, bringing Popular Support to 80.At night, Bai Qi hunted a wild deer and a few rabbits. Everyone sat around a large bonfire together, making it seem quite lively. However, Zhao Fu was too used to being alone and could not join in, so he stayed indoors.Normally, killing non-humanoid creatures in the Heaven Awaken World would not result in any drops apart from a few copper coins. At the same time, residents or soldiers killing other creatures increased the experience of the Village, which helped the Village level up.At this moment, Li Si respectfully walked in with a wooden plate with many carefully-cut pieces of cooked deer meat on it and said, \u201cYour Majesty, please eat.\u201dZhao Fu nodded. After working for so long, he felt quite hungry. He picked up the wooden chopsticks that they had made and tasted a piece, finding it incredibly fresh and delicious.He was going to continue eating, but when he saw Li Si politely standing by his side, ready to tend to his needs, he couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cLi Si, you don\u2019t need to stay here with me; you can go outside. It\u2019s more lively out there.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLi Si slightly smiled before replying, \u201cIt\u2019s better for me to stay with Your Majesty!\u201dZhao Fu felt a slight warmth within his heart and didn\u2019t say anything. He continued to eat the deer meat when Bai Qi also walked in and stood by his side.\u201cWhat are your thoughts towards Great Qin\u2019s future?\u201d Zhao Fu, who was eating the deer meat, suddenly asked.Li Si was the Prime Minister of an empire, and Bai Qi was a famed General. Their insight and knowledge of tactics were definitely above Zhao Fu\u2019s, so he did not act arrogantly, and instead sincerely asked for their opinions.Right now, the entire world was a chaotic chessboard, but there was nothing that had been determined yet. Life, death, heroes, altruists, and formidable characters had not been determined yet, neither had who the chess pieces or the players were. None of this was certain. If they didn\u2019t start preparing now and failed to advance and consolidate at every step, all that was waiting for them would be failure and death.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Following this, Eastern Han was split into the Three Kingdoms. The Wei, Jin, and Northern and Southern Dynasties followed when foreigners suddenly put China into grave danger.\u201d\u201cWhy? How could our glorious country be bullied by other tribes?\u201d Bai Qi couldn\u2019t help but speak when he heard what Zhao Fu had said. After realizing that he had spoken out of turn, he quickly apologized to Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu lightly shook his head, signaling that it was fine. He explained that China was no longer a place that other tribes feared and could be bullied easily after the Qin Dynasty. During the Qin Dynasty, there was the School of the Military, Legalists, School of Vertical and Horizontal, Taoists, Confucianists, and Mohists, creating the Hundred Schools of Thought and a galaxy of talented people.However, after the Han dynasty, the Hundred Schools of Thought were rejected, with Confucianism being favored. Studying literature became favored, and even though this was not bad, the military was neglected as a result.\u201cYour Majesty! I believe that we must stay away from big battles if we are to win, especially those with other Chinese factions,\u201d Bai Qi said seriously. Even though Bai Qi had been quite angry initially, he quickly calmed down.Li Si nodded. \u201cYour Majesty, China is currently the largest battle region, and if we\u2019re caught up in these battles, our consumption of resources may be too great. The best thing for us is to remain independent and neutral.\u201dZhao Fu took in their advice and nodded before continuing to outline the history of China. Soon, the three of them created a roadmap of Great Qin\u2019s future.Even though they had planned quite far into the future, this was the direction they would head in. Right now, the most important thing was to develop the Great Qin Village well.Without knowing it, Zhao Fu had stayed in the Heaven Awaken World for 10 or so hours, and it would nearly be dawn in the real world. Because there were some things he needed to take care of in the real world, Zhao Fu instructed Bai Qi and Li Si to send people to patrol during the night to ensure their safety. Following this, he came out of the Heaven Awaken World.After his consciousness returned to his body, Zhao Fu slowly opened his eyes and saw that it was daytime. He found his phone and looked at the time, and it was already 8 AM.After crawling up from the ground, Zhao Fu washed his face and rinsed his mouth before going out to buy some things for breakfast.Following this, Zhao Fu planned to withdraw from his university. During the Legacy Trial, he had been warned that the real world would be devoured by the Heaven Awaken World not too long in the future. As such, continuing to study was pointless, so Zhao Fu decided to change his way of living.Nanshi University was a famous university within China, and anyone who could enter was elite. Entering this kind of university was something that many people dreamed about.\u201cAre you sure you want to withdraw?\u201dThe teacher in charge of Zhao Fu\u2019s classes, Li Hong, looked at Zhao Fu with pity and tried to talk him out of it. Zhao Fu was quite reclusive during class, but his grades were always quite good. If Zhao Fu graduated, he would have a bright future, but Li Hong had never expected that Zhao Fu would suddenly withdraw.Zhao Fu sincerely nodded, confirming that he had thought about it thoroughly. In the end, Li Hong could only reluctantly agree. After going through the withdrawal procedures, he received $5000 from the university.During his years in university, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t have any fun. Whenever he had free time, he worked. Currently, he had 3 different jobs. Even though it had been quite tough, he had quite a bit of money saved up. If he lived frugally, it would last him a few years.Zhao Fu bought a few boxes of instant noodles and returned home. He turned on his second-hand laptop and looked through some of the information regarding the Heaven Awaken World. Right now, the Heaven Awaken World was the most popular thing on the news.Almost everyone was chatting about the Heaven Awaken World, and as Zhao Fu searched on the internet, countless pieces of information jumped out. Zhao Fu found that someone had already created a Heaven Awaken World Forum, on which there were already over 100 million users. What\u2019s more, this number was still rapidly increasing.\u201cWho created this forum so quickly?\u201d Zhao Fu wondered before creating an account. He entered the forum and had a look around. Apart from chatting about things in the Heaven Awaken World, there were threads about selling and buying things in the Heaven Awaken World.1 copper coin was already worth $8 in the real world.Of course, the powerful families in the real world also knew what would happen in the future, so they started to funnel all of their resources into the Heaven Awaken World. In fact, someone had offered hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase a Legacy Stone. Normal people had no idea about what was to come, and they only felt incredibly jealous. If they had one of those stones, the money they could earn from it would last them several lifetimes.However, to those who had Legacy Stones, they could only laugh. They had to pass through many trials to obtain the legacy, and if they sold the Legacy Stone for a bit of money, they wouldn\u2019t have deserved it in the first place.Zhao Fu felt quite a bit of pressure when he saw the large families pouring their resources into the Heaven Awaken World.However, something worth rejoicing over was that even though there were many main cities from the system, each main city was managed by the Lord of that city. This meant that the regions were not connected to each other, and it also meant that there were many different regions within the Heaven Awaken World. If one wanted to move to another region, it would depend on his or her own efforts.However, with how big the Heaven Awaken World was, all of the regions were tens of thousands of kilometers away from each other, and one could only imagine the danger of crossing to another region.When people usually entered the Heaven Awaken World, they were randomly placed at a location. Even though the powerful families had invested massive amounts of resources, they were in different regions, or Zhao Fu would have lost from the very beginning.In the forums, Zhao Fu found the place where he was. It was called the \u2018Forest of Horrors\u2019 and had 3 main cities. The one in the east was called \u2018Holy Light City\u2019, the one in the south was called \u2018Soldier Forest\u2019, and the one in the west was called \u2018Demon Tree City\u2019.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu looked at the introductions of each of the main cities. Each main city was very big, and it could hold more than 1 million people. Entry into the main cities cost 2 copper coins, and ordinary fights were forbidden, though there was an Arena where one could legally fight. The guards at the main cities normally had above Stage 1 cultivation.There were all sorts of things in the main cities, such as Silver grade weapons. The Heaven Awaken World\u2019s weapons were split into Normal (White), Superior (Blue), Rare (Silver), Perfect (Gold), Legendary (Violet), and Epic (Orange).Normal weapons gave one stat, Blue equipment gave two stats, Silver equipment gave three stats, Gold equipment gave four stats, and so on.Apart from the things sold in main cities, each main city had Merit Points, and completing quests from the main cities gave Merit Points. Merit Points could be exchanged for different rewards, and they could even be exchanged for positions in the city.Zhao Fu read the introductions to the main cities with great interest before letting out a breath, planning to enter the Heaven Awaken World again. The real world looked quite peaceful as usual, but in actuality, it was only the calm before the storm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123It was morning when Zhao Fu entered the Heaven Awaken World again. This time, Zhao Fu summoned fourteen people: eight males and six females, and seven of them could fight. There was also a B grade villager among them, a white-haired elder, and Zhao Fu immediately changed his profession to Scholar.As for what he was to research, because crop output was not a problem due to the Village\u2019s special stats, Zhao Fu had the elder choose Taming. If they could obtain the Taming skill, they would be able to tame some wild beasts and start developing livestock.Now that they had houses, they had more safety and could start farming. Zhao Fu did not do this himself, and he instead left it to Li Si. Zhao Fu brought Bai Qi along and took the few weapons in the Smithy. They started to patrol the surrounding area to see if there were any dangers or resources.On the way, Zhao Fu and his super-bodyguard Bai Qi killed a few wild rabbits and two wolves. They only dropped copper coins, and the wild rabbits only dropped one copper coin each, while the wolves dropped three to four copper coins each.Suddenly, the grasses shook as a rabbit that was a little bit bigger than the dog appeared. It had flame-red fur and was not cute like most rabbits. Instead, it looked quite ugly, and there was a savage and vicious look in its eyes.Bai Qi threw down the rabbit and wolf corpses he was holding and blocked the path in front of Zhao Fu.At this moment, the rabbit opened its mouth and fire elemental essence gathered in its mouth, forming a fireball. Following this, it flicked its head upwards as the fireball rushed towards Zhao Fu.While facing the fireball, Bai Qi said seriously, \u201cYour Majesty! Please retreat for a moment!\u201dZhao Fu nodded. Fighting was not his strength, so he wasn\u2019t going to bring trouble to himself.The fireball flew over, and a hint of sword qi covered Bai Qi\u2019s sword as he slashed the fireball.Bang!!The fireball exploded into sparks, not injuring Bai Qi in the slightest.Zhao Fu sighed in amazement when he saw this. SSS grade characters were indeed quite powerful. In just a short period of time, Bai Qi\u2019s cultivation had already greatly increased.Following this, the rabbit once again shot out a few fireballs towards Bai Qi, but he easily evaded all of them. Bai Qi was not only SSS grade, but his stats were also incredibly high, and he had a buff from his Title and Profession, making him quite strong.The rabbit started to look irritated when he saw that its fireballs were unable to hit Bai Qi. It leaped up and opened its mouth, revealing 2 sharp fangs as it tried to bite Bai Qi.Bai Qi coldly harrumphed and turned his body as he stabbed it with his sword. Blood flew through the air as the sword pierced through the rabbit\u2019s throat, killing it instantly.\u201cSystem announcement! Your General has killed an Elite magic beast, the Violent Flame Rabbit, and has gained 6 Achievement Points.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! You have gained 3 Achievement Points.\u201dSo it was an Elite magic beast. magic beasts were variants of normal creatures, and they had stronger bodies as well as magic. For example, the Violent Flame Rabbit could shoot fireballs.Killing Elite magic beasts or above gave Achievement Points, as did attacking other Villages. Achievement Points are mainly used to raise one\u2019s status. In order to raise the level of one\u2019s village, he or she needs to have a certain status. For example, in order to raise his village to an Intermediate Village, Zhao Fu\u2019s status needed to be at least Citizen, but he was only a Commoner right now.At the same time, the higher one\u2019s status was, the better his or her treatment would be in main cities.The Violet Flame Rabbit dropped 2 shining silver coins and a red orb of light, which Bai Qi delivered to Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu looked at the red orb of light. It was called an Innate Elemental Orb, and after using it, one would obtain the corresponding skill. After using it, Zhao Fu obtained a Fireball skill.The gains from today were quite good. Realizing that it was almost midday, Zhao Fu carried the Violet Flame Rabbit while Bai Qi carried the wild rabbits and wolves as they made their way back.At this moment, however, Zhao Fu suddenly saw a very strange-looking tree. Its bark was jet-black and gave off a metallic luster. The tree was about ten meters tall, and its trunk was one meter wide. Its leaves were also a dark green color.Zhao Fu had a look and saw that it was called the Decade Iron Tree.[Decade Iron Tree]: Grade: White. Can be used to create equipment.Zhao Fu was delighted when he saw this tree because they could now create weapons. There were only a few weapons in the Smithy right now, and there were not enough for everyone. As such, Zhao Fu\u2019s discovery of the Decade Iron Tree alleviated the awkwardness of not having enough weapons.Zhao Fu immediately went back and brought people to cut down the Decade Iron Tree to create wooden sabers, wooden swords, wooden shields, and wooden bows. Even though wooden sabers and swords could not compare to iron sabers and swords, they could still deal damage. Moreover, Zhao Fu could now have people change to Shieldbearer or Archer professions.They had made great progress today: they created weapons, cultivated land, and planted their wheat seeds. Everything was coming along nicely, and Zhao Fu felt quite excited. At night, he did not leave the Heaven Awaken World and instead cultivated.The third day.This time, he summoned 15 people: 10 males and 5 females. There were 8 of them who could fight, so Zhao Fu had 4 of them become Shieldbearers and 4 of them become Archers. Now, the Great Qin Village had 21 soldiers.Zhao Fu was about to take Bai Qi with him to patrol around when suddenly, a few of the women responsible for collecting wild fruits quickly ran over and said that they had discovered Outlanders, a term for foreign races.Zhao Fu\u2019s expression became serious when he heard about this, and he quickly asked for specifics.The women had been 2 kilometers south of the Great Qin Village, and they had been collecting wild fruits when they suddenly heard some wild boars scream. They gathered up their courage to take a look and saw some wild boars being surrounded and killed by Outlanders. After that, they immediately ran back in terror and reported what they saw to Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu immediately took people to go south. By now, the Outlanders had left, but there were still traces of blood and footprints on the ground. 3 kilometers south of the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu discovered an Outlander village.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Outlanders that lived there were not very tall \u2013 they were a bit more than one meter tall \u2013 and had green skin, pointy ears, and bulging stomachs. They were extremely alike to the creatures found in most games, Goblins.There were around 300 or so Goblins in the Goblin village, and Zhao Fu immediately felt a sense of danger while anxiously observing the village from outside.He found that there were 300 or so goblins in the village. There were 40 to 50 elderly and young Goblins, and 80 or so female Goblins. Only about 190 of the Goblins could fight.This was a Normal grade village, which meant that there were only 100 soldiers at most. Nearly half of the Goblins who were able to fight did not have a profession, making them weaker due to not having any skills or Profession bonuses.Most Goblins held sabers and were called [Goblin Soldiers], and Zhao Fu also found some Goblins that were 2 meters tall and very well-built. They held knives that looked disproportionate to their bodies and looked incredibly savage. Those Goblins were called [Goblin Warriors].Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123There were not many Goblin Warriors, only 5 of them, but what caught Zhao Fu\u2019s attention was the one-meter-tall blood-colored altar at the center of the village. The altar was made of different kinds of rocks, and it gave him a very bad feeling.Given how close they were, the Great Qin Village would be in great danger if the Goblins discovered the Great Qin Village. Right now, the Great Qin Village only had 47 residents and 21 soldiers. How could they fight more than 190 Goblins?These Goblins definitely weren\u2019t as easy to kill as the ones in games that had virtually no fighting power. After examining them closely, Zhao Fu found that their fighting power was quite decent.Zhao Fu thought for a while with a serious expression on his face.\u201cBai Qi! I\u2019ll stay here to observe the Goblins. Hurry and take everyone back to the Great Qin Village and tell Li Si to go into Level 1 Defence Mode. Train all of the soldiers so that it won\u2019t be their first time fighting if we do go to war. If something happens, I don\u2019t want anyone to die because we failed to prepare properly.\u201dBai Qi became quite worried when he heard this, and he said anxiously, \u201cBut Your Majesty, your safety\u2026\u201dZhao Fu felt a warm feeling within his heart and cut Bai Qi off, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll be careful, and it\u2019s best that I do this. I\u2019ll be able to plan our defenses while looking for any weaknesses. However, you should train them as quickly as possible because the Goblins might find us soon.\u201dBai Qi realized the gravity of this matter, and he could only sincerely nod before taking everyone back to the village and informing Li Si.Li Si became quite serious and commanded the women to reinforce the fences and help make all sorts of weapons.Bai Qi called together all of the soldiers and trained them in arranging formations, working together, and mobilizing together.When the Great Qin Village\u2019s villagers heard that Zhao Fu was risking his life by standing guard and observing the Goblin Village, they all felt incredibly moved. Everyone worked hard together, and soon, Popular Support rose to 90.Zhao Fu hid in some tall grass on a hill and was looking down at the Goblin Village, searching for any weaknesses. If they engaged in a direct confrontation, it would be a pyrrhic victory even if they won. This was not something that Zhao Fu wanted.Time gradually passed, and soon, the sunset and part of the sky was dyed red. At this moment, Bai Qi brought some people to come and find him.Zhao Fu sighed. After observing for so long, he hadn\u2019t found anything that he could exploit. However, he learned some things about the Goblins. First, their intelligence was not very high, and they loved to fight. They often started fighting over a piece of meat.It was about to get dark, so Zhao Fu could only return, leaving 2 people there to stand guard. He had considered a night attack, but they still only had 23 people when adding himself and Bai Qi. Facing 300 or so Goblins, even a night raid would not work.As a result, Zhao Fu did not sleep very well. The next day, he once again summoned new villagers. This time, there were only five of them who could fight out of the fifteen he summoned, making Zhao Fu feel quite disappointed.At this moment, one of the villagers he had left behind last night to keep watch came to report and said, \u201cYour Majesty! The Goblins have started to move.\u201dZhao Fu quickly asked for more details. He learned that the Goblin village\u2019s soldiers had split into 4 groups, with about 50 Goblins in each group, and had headed in 4 separate directions.After the villager reported this, Zhao Fu felt that an opportunity had come. The Goblins were not a farming race, and they relied on hunting to obtain food. The Goblins went out hunting every day to make sure that they had enough to eat.\u201cBai Qi! Hurry and assemble everyone!\u201d Zhao Fu immediately ordered.Following this, 26 soldiers were gathered in front of Zhao Fu. Zhao Fu brought a few fruits to serve as breakfast and then led Bai Qi and the soldiers to catch up to one of the Goblin groups.There were roughly 50 Goblins in this group, and it was led by a Goblin Warrior.At this moment, Bai Qi showed the results of his training. What followed was a true battle, not a disorderly brawl.Bai Qi ordered the soldiers into three lines: Shieldbearers at the first line, Infantry at the second line, and Archers at the third line. This was the most basic formation.\u201cArchers, I know that you changed professions recently, so I don\u2019t expect you to kill someone with every arrow. Just make sure you hit them; aim for the largest parts of their bodies,\u201d Bai Qi said to the Archers before making the signal to fire.Following this, the Archers raised their bows, and arrows shot out into the group of Goblins. Zhao Fu also released a Fireball with them, sending it shooting towards the Goblins.The eight Archers all hit a Goblin. Three of them received light injuries, four received heavy injuries, and one unfortunate Goblin was killed on the spot. Zhao Fu\u2019s Fireball also exploded, injuring 5 or 6 Goblins. One was blasted into the sky and crashed to the ground \u2013 that one didn\u2019t have long to live.At this moment, the Goblins also discovered them. They roared as they raised their sabers and rushed over.Many of the soldiers revealed terrified looks when they saw so many Goblins rushing towards them. After all, they had never fought in a real battle before. Bai Qi coldly harrumphed when he saw this, and the fear that everyone felt suddenly decreased when they heard him. It was most likely due to Bai Qi\u2019s Title that increased morale.\u201cRelease arrows!\u201d Bai Qi once again bellowed, and eight arrows flew, shooting a few Goblins down. The Goblins were prepared this time, so not as many arrows hit the Goblins. Zhao Fu also released a Fireball, blasting a few Goblins again.By now, the Goblins were nearly within 10 meters of them. Bai Qi yelled, \u201cShieldbearers advance! Scatter their spirit! Infantry, follow right behind them!\u201dThe 8 Shieldbearers rushed up, colliding with the Goblins at the front. The Goblins chopped at the wooden shields, leaving shallow marks, but they were unable to injure anyone. Thus, the Goblins\u2019 momentum was greatly reduced.A charge required a large spurt of energy, and only by continuously charging forwards could they maintain their momentum. After being blocked by the Shieldbearers, the Goblins lost not only their momentum but also their morale.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the beginning, the arrows and Fireballs had already reduced the Goblins\u2019 strength by almost a third, and now that they had been stopped, the Shieldbearers and Infantry started to counterattack. The Archers behind them also freely shot as Zhao Fu continuously launched Fireballs.The situation quickly turned to Zhao Fu\u2019s favor.As for the large, well-built Goblin Warrior, it was held at bay by Bai Qi single-handedly. Even though the large Goblin Warrior looked quite fat, it was quite agile. It slashed the knife in its hands quite quickly, and Zhao Fu could only see a flash of light whenever it attacked. Zhao Fu felt quite worried when he saw this, but it was good that Bai Qi was not weak either.After an hour, the battle finally concluded. Zhao Fu\u2019s people suffered some light injuries, but most of them were fine. On the other hand, the Goblins had been completely destroyed. This was the result of many different military professions cooperating well.After resting for a while, Zhao Fu took his people to chase after another Goblin group.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123The second group of Goblins had less than 50 Goblins, and just like the first time, the Archers launched their arrows, injuring and killing a few Goblins, before the Shieldbearers rushed up with the Infantry right behind them.Zhao Fu also launched 2 Fireballs, but he started feeling mentally tired. He had already launched 7 Fireballs when dealing with the first Goblin group, so he had to stop for a while.The Shieldbearers and Infantry battled with the Goblins while maintaining orderly ranks, with the Archers freely shooting from behind them.At this moment, one of the Goblins rushed out of the fray and raised its saber as it howled, charging towards Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu didn\u2019t feel any fear when he saw this because he had been mentally prepared for a long time. Facing this life or death battle, he gripped the iron sword in his hands and rushed to meet the Goblin. Zhao Fu looked at the Goblin charging towards him and slashed towards it with all of his might.The Goblin tilted its head, easily evading Zhao Fu\u2019s attack. It cackled as it mocked Zhao Fu, slicing at Zhao Fu\u2019s waist with its saber, causing Zhao Fu to quickly retreat.Seeing this, the Goblin pressed forwards.Zhao Fu had slipped up the first time, but he remained calm and ignored the Goblin\u2019s taunts. Facing a real life or death battle, his heart wildly thumped with nervousness. However, he did not fail to monitor his surroundings and took a step back before suddenly leaping towards the Goblin and stabbing towards it.The Goblin also easily avoided this strike, and it immediately moved forwards and swung its saber towards Zhao Fu. However, at this moment, it tripped on a stone and lost its balance.This was what Zhao Fu had been aiming for, and he swung his sword towards the Goblin.The sword cut into the Goblin\u2019s neck and some blood flowed out, but it had not cut too deeply. As such, it did not deal too much damage.The Goblin howled in pain and raised the saber in its hands. It was about to slash down when Zhao Fu\u2019s heart tightened, and he used all of his strength to push the sword deeper into the Goblin\u2019s neck twisted upwards.Blood sprayed, filling the air.Warm blood covered Zhao Fu\u2019s body, and the Goblin\u2019s corpse slowly fell to the ground. After taking a life for the first time, Zhao Fu\u2019s heart thumped quickly as he raggedly breathed.By now, the battle between the groups had also concluded. Bai Qi killed the Goblin Warrior and suddenly turned to see Zhao Fu covered in blood. He was given a great fright, and quickly hurried over and asked worriedly, \u201cYour Majesty, are you alright?\u201dZhao Fu gradually recovered and slightly shook his head, signaling that he was fine.Seeing this, Bai Qi let out a sigh of relief.\u201cAsk around to see if anyone was injured!\u201d Zhao Fu said.Bai Qi nodded and looked at everyone before answering, \u201cYour Majesty, no one was injured greatly.\u201dZhao Fu let out a breath and looked up at the sky. It was nearly midday, so they would not be able to catch up to the third and fourth groups. As such, he decided to lay in wait and ambush the third group when they came back.Li Si brought a group of women to deliver lunch for them, and everyone rested for a while.Time gradually passed, and soon, the third group of Goblins returned with a few wolves, 10 or so wild rabbits, and a 200-kilogram wild boar \u2013 a bountiful journey.Zhao Fu and his soldiers were hidden in the grass, waiting for an opportunity.The Goblin Warrior swaggering at the head of the group suddenly sneezed, attracting many of the Goblin Soldiers\u2019 attention. It was then that Bai Qi gave the order to attack.Arrows flew towards the Goblins, piercing them and causing quite a commotion. A few Goblins were instantly killed, and others were heavily injured. After recovering for a few hours, Zhao Fu\u2019s mind had recovered by more than half, and he could use Fireballs again. As such, he also launched a few.With the experience that they had gained from the previous two battles and adding on the fact that it was an ambush, this battle was much shorter than the previous two battles. Barely anyone was injured \u2013 of course, this was also partially due to the Goblins\u2019 weariness and the injuries they already had from hunting.After resting for a bit, Zhao Fu led his people to where the fourth group of Goblins was returning from.It was a pity that the fourth group had already reached the Goblin Village, making Zhao Fu feel quite disappointed. If they could have destroyed the fourth group, the Goblin village would not have been as scary.By now, they had killed nearly 150 Goblins, and the Goblin village sensed that something was wrong. They had no idea who the enemy was or how many enemies there were, so they could only nervously stand guard.Many Goblins were standing on the outer perimeter of the village, attentively looking around. Whenever they detected anything, they immediately rushed up and surrounded it.Zhao Fu and his soldiers came quite close to the Goblin village, and he had a look at the tight security. He muttered, \u201cRight now, the Goblin Village only has around 60 Goblins who can fight. The rest are all elderly, children, or females.\u201dThe Goblin village seemed to have been greatly weakened, but Zhao Fu did not plan to attack. He wasn\u2019t in a rush because the Goblins went out to hunt every day to make sure they had enough food. As such, once they ate all of their food, they would definitely come out. Compared to directly attacking, ambushing was easier and went much more smoothly.Moreover, Zhao Fu did not want to make any sacrifices. By now, Zhao Fu felt incredibly close to the Great Qin Village and its residents.However, they couldn\u2019t just wait here idly for the Goblins to come out. While the Goblins were still in the village, Zhao Fu ordered his people to start laying all sorts of traps around the village.The sky gradually darkened, and after leaving a few people to keep watch, Zhao Fu and the others brought back the spoils from the battles with the Goblins. There were 10 or so wild rabbits, a few wolves, and the wild boar. Even though wolf meat didn\u2019t taste very good, it was better than nothing. Moreover, wolf teeth could be used to make arrowheads, and wolf skin could be used to make leather armor.The materials gained from the Violent Flame Rabbit were Blue grade. However, He Yun\u2019s, the Tailor Shop\u2019s owner, tailoring skill was only at Basic level, so she was unable to use Blue grade materials to create leather armor. As a result, it was just stored in her shop.After returning to the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu and the others lit a bonfire. Now that the crisis was resolved, the atmosphere was no longer as tense, and the villagers laughed and talked heartily with each other.As Zhao Fu entered the village, a few four or five-year-old children excitedly ran over. They crowded around Zhao Fu and looked at him in awe as they cheered, \u201cYour Majesty! You\u2019re so amazing; you killed so many Outlanders!\u201dZhao Fu slightly smiled when he heard this and explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t do all of it; your parents contributed greatly as well.\u201d\u201cBut it was under Your Majesty\u2019s amazing leadership that we were able to kill so many Outlanders,\u201d one of the boys said excitedly as he hugged Zhao Fu\u2019s leg.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis boy was quite good at flattery despite being so young. Zhao Fu lightly smiled and patted his little head, the coldness in his heart gradually thawing.Following this, the children\u2019s parents quickly came over and apologized before taking them away.Zhao Fu went to the Village Hall and thought for a moment before asking Li Si, \u201cHow were our gains from killing the Goblins today?\u201dThere was no time for Zhao Fu and his group of soldiers to collect the spoils after each battle, so this was left to Li Si and a group of women.Li Si grinned and cupped his hands respectfully as he replied, \u201cWe obtained 152 Goblin Sabres. However, they\u2019re too small and aren\u2019t suited for our use, so they need to be modified. We obtained 685 copper coins from killing the Goblin Soldiers and 7 silver coins from killing the 3 Goblin Warriors.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The next day, he summoned 14 new villagers. There were seven people who could fight and a B grade woman, who Zhao Fu also arranged to change to Scholar. He hoped that they would be able to gain the Taming skill with more Scholars soon.Zhao Fu took the seven people who were able to fight to become soldiers. Now, Zhao Fu had 28 soldiers, and he brought them to the Goblin village.The Goblin village was still in full defense mode, so Zhao Fu chose to not attack. Instead, he told Bai Qi to continue laying traps while training the soldiers.Another day passed, and Zhao Fu summoned another 15 people. Six of them could fight, so Zhao Fu arranged for them to change profession to soldiers. The Goblins still hadn\u2019t dared to come out, so Zhao Fu continued to wait while setting traps. While doing this, Zhao Fu also discovered another Decade Iron Tree.The next day, Zhao Fu summoned 14 people, eight of whom could fight, and one B grade villager, and he sent them all to change professions.The Goblins finally ran out of food today, and they could no longer endure the hunger. This time, roughly 100 or so Goblins came out of the Goblin village, and about half of them were females. There were 4 Goblin Warriors who had just changed professions, and they were a bit smaller than the Goblin Warriors from before.Right now, there were only 20 or so Goblins left in the village that could fight and the Goblin Warrior that had returned from the previous hunting expedition. There were 30 or so females, and some elderly and young Goblins who essentially couldn\u2019t fight.From how things looked, it seemed that attacking the Goblin village would be quite easy, but Zhao Fu felt that it would not be so simple. He felt that the blood-colored altar was not ordinary, and there could be something special about it.As such, Zhao Fu decided to attack the 100 or so Goblins. Of course, it was stupid to directly attack them, or they would have set all of those traps for nothing.Zhao Fu split up the 34 soldiers into three groups and gave an explanation of their plan before sending one team to attack.When the Goblins saw that there were so few enemies, they immediately raised their sabers and yelled as they rushed over. The group of people attacked a few times and turned and ran, following Zhao Fu\u2019s orders.The Goblins cheered excitedly and chased after them, wanting to kill the enemies who had tormented them for the past few days.However, in the next moment, the Goblins started to fall into the ready-dug pits, and they were impaled by the sharp wooden spikes. They continuously howled, the big group of Goblins instantly losing 20 out of the 100 Goblins.After losing a portion of their forces instantly, all of the Goblins stopped, not daring to advance. They had no idea if there were more of these pits ahead, so they did not dare to advance. All they could do was stand still as they furiously roared.Swish, swish, swish\u2026Suddenly, a few arrows pierced some of the Goblins. The Goblins saw a few enemies running from their left, and they immediately chased after them in rage.As they ran, they triggered trap after trap. Large logs and rocks smashed down from above, either heavily injuring Goblins or killing them directly.The 80 or so Goblins had now been reduced to about 50. At this moment, another group appeared to the right of the Goblins, shooting them with arrows before running away.The Goblins had already suffered twice, and they did not dare to stupidly chase after them anymore. They could only stand still at where they were and brandish their weapons, roaring at the escaping enemies.By now, the other two groups had merged and circled around from behind the Goblins. Arrows and fireballs landed on the group of Goblins, catching them completely off-guard. This attack was quite effective: the fireball heavily injured two Goblins and gave a few other Goblins light injuries, while nine arrows found their marks, killing three Goblins, heavily injuring five, and lightly injuring one.Now, there were only around 40 Goblins who were still able to fight. The group that had been running also turned around and started to attack, reducing the Goblins\u2019 numbers even more.\u201cBai Qi, get rid of one of the Goblin Warriors as quickly as possible. All Shieldbearers focus on defense and hold up the other two Goblin Warriors. Infantry charge, and Archers fire at will. Leave the Goblin Warrior with the lame legs to me,\u201d Zhao Fu loudly commanded, and everyone moved to carry out his orders.The remaining Goblin Soldiers had only just changed professions and many of them were female, so they were quickly dealt with by the Infantry and Archers. Eight or nine Shieldbearers held wooden shields and tightly surrounded two of the Goblin Warriors.Zhao Fu was able to deal with the lame Goblin Warrior quite easily. Of course, he did not fight it at close range because he definitely wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat it. Instead, he launched Fireballs at it \u2013 because the Goblin Warrior was quite large and had lame legs, it was unable to dodge his attacks, and it was killed by Zhao Fu in the end.On the other side, Bai Qi quickly dealt with the Goblin Warrior he was responsible for. The remaining two Goblin Warriors did not require Bai Qi to act, and they were killed by arrows. They died in quite a pitiful manner \u2013 they were surrounded by shields and barely had any space to dodge the arrows that rained down on them.After the battle was over, everyone started to sweep the battlefield.Bai Qi put away his sword and turned to look at Zhao Fu, a hint of a smile on his cold and handsome face. Zhao Fu\u2019s tactics and commands during the fight had been stellar. He lacked experience in large battles, but this was enough to show Zhao Fu\u2019s exceptional talent. How could Bai Qi not feel happy to have such a capable lord?Zhao Fu turned around and saw Bai Qi\u2019s smile. Zhao Fu felt quite confused and asked, \u201cBai Qi, what are you smiling at?\u201dBai Qi lightly shook his head and did not respond to Zhao Fu\u2019s question. Instead, he asked, \u201cYour Majesty, how should we proceed? Do we attack the Goblin village?\u201dAfter thinking about it, Zhao Fu replied, \u201cSurround it first. I feel that there is something strange about the Goblin Village. Regardless, they don\u2019t have any food, so they\u2019ll have to come out sooner or later. There\u2019s no need to rush.\u201dBai Qi nodded and replied, \u201cThis subordinate feels the same way. They probably left the village empty to lure us over. However, they hadn\u2019t expected that Your Majesty would ambush the 100 or so Goblin Soldiers and 4 Goblin Warriors, who have now all been destroyed, instead of attacking the village.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu felt more and more that the Goblin village was not so simple. After clearing out the battlefield, he took his soldiers to surround the village.The Goblins looked at the enemies surrounding their village and understood what had happened. Looks of fear and terror appeared on their faces as the village became somewhat chaotic.Zhao Fu looked on from outside and did not plan to attack. They were in the palm of his hands, so there was no need to be hurried.After observing the village for 10 or so minutes, Zhao Fu was surprised to see an elderly Goblin walk out with an ancient, wooden walking stick. The elderly Goblin brought the rest of the Goblins out and knelt at the entrance of the village.Following this, Zhao Fu received a system announcement, \u201cLogue Village has surrendered to you. Would you like to accept?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123Zhao Fu and Bai Qi looked at each other, feeling quite surprised. They had expected the Goblins to go hungry for a few days before charging out in desperation, yet the Goblins had unexpectedly surrendered. Zhao Fu lightly smiled and chose to accept, and another system announcement sounded in his mind.\u201cYou have accepted Logue Village\u2019s surrender. You have received 50 Achievement Points!\u201dFollowing this, Zhao Fu brought his people to the entrance of the village, saying to the kneeling Goblins, \u201cYou can all rise!\u201dHearing this, the Goblins all slowly stood up with expressions of fear in their eyes. Even though they couldn\u2019t understand what Zhao Fu was saying, they understood his intentions. This was because lords had translations available to them, and it was similar to telepathic communication skills. Even though they spoke different languages, they could understand each other\u2019s intentions.At this moment, the elderly Goblin kneeling at the front spoke a few garbled words that meant, \u201cWe thank the respected lord for accepting Logue Village\u2019s surrender.\u201dZhao Fu nodded and asked curiously, \u201cLogue, why did you choose to surrender now instead of waiting a few days?\u201dLogue was the name of the elderly, bitter-looking Goblin. From the beginning, he had suspected that Zhao Fu did not have many people because of his reluctance to attack the village. As such, he sent out 100 Goblins in order to hunt for food and to entice Zhao Fu to attack the village.If Zhao Fu had chosen to attack the village, he could have used the blood-colored altar\u2019s effects and the remaining Goblins in the village to deal a serious blow to Zhao Fu. However, it hadn\u2019t even crossed his mind that Zhao Fu would attack the 100 Goblins instead of the village. Not only did he kill all 100 Goblins in the hunting party, but he also chose to surround the village without attacking them.At that point in time, Logue Village only had two options if they did not surrender: the first one was to starve to death, while the second one was to charge the encirclement. Comparatively speaking, it was much better to surrender as early as possible.After hearing Logue\u2019s explanation, Zhao Fu took his people to the center of the village and looked at the blood-colored altar, receiving some information.[Demon Altar]: Can be used to change one\u2019s profession to Demon Priest through a sacrifice. Special effects: Demon Priests standing on the Demon Altar can communicate with gods. Effects: All stats +5%.When Zhao Fu saw this information, he motioned for Bai Qi to bring over a wild beast. Soon, Bai Qi carried over a 150-kilogram wild boar and placed it on the altar. Zhao Fu slit the wild boar\u2019s throat with a knife, and the wild boar screamed as its blood poured out.As the blood flowed onto the altar, the blood-red altar shined with a bloody light. The wild boar seemed to be completely terrified, and it continuously shrieked. After it died, the wild boar\u2019s corpse shriveled up until it became completely dry, giving it a terrifying appearance.The bloody light coming from the altar became even more intense, and an illusory image that looked like an imp appeared in the air. The imp had three short horns on its head, pitch black pupils, and a pair of small and large wings on its back.\u201cTadidawuatoka!\u201dThe demonic image said in the demon language, meaning, \u201cLowly human, do you believe in our glorious god, Kerr?\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! Would you like to change your profession to Demon Priest?\u201d\u201cWarning! Once you change your profession to Demon Priest, your Swordsman profession will be erased, but you will keep the skills!\u201dZhao Fu did not hesitate to accept. A bloody light shot from the demonic image into Zhao Fu\u2019s forehead, following which Zhao Fu heard a system announcement.[Demon Priest]: D grade Military. Description: A Priest of the Demon God Kerr. Effects: Receives [Demon\u2019s Power]After the bloody light shot into Zhao Fu\u2019s forehead, the demonic image slowly disappeared, and everything went back to normal.Zhao Fu looked at his Demon Priest profession and marvelled inwardly, \u201c _This D grade military profession is much better than my previous profession. It gives Strength +1%, Constitution +1%, and Intelligence +4%; [Hell Fireball] and [Blood Healing] skills; and [Demon\u2019s Power], which gives all stats +2_.\u201dIt was a pity that this was the limit for this military profession. The so-called \u2018Demon God Kerr\u2019 was only a low godly spirit in Hell, and it was not very powerful.In this world, there was a maximum of 100 Demon priests. Zhao Fu had been quite lucky that one had died not too long ago, so there was a spot available for him.Zhao Fu felt quite pleased, and he smiled as he went to look at the Goblin\u2019s barracks. The Goblins only had two Profession Change Stone Steles:[Goblin Soldier]: F grade Military. Description: Soldiers of the Goblin race. Effects: Receives the skill [Slash].[Goblin Warrior]: E+ grade Military. Description: Goblins that have mutated by obtaining the primogenitor\u2019s power. Effects: Receives [Primogenitor\u2019s Power].No wonder the Goblin Warriors were so powerful; they were E+ grade Military. However, they were limited to five positions.Currently, the Great Qin Village had not developed much, so even though Logue Village had become a Subsidiary Village, Logue Village would only be slightly affected and would not receive great benefits.Zhao Fu went to have a look at the other parts of Logue Village before coming to the Storehouse. They had quite a lot of money, roughly 4,000 copper coins and 15 silver coins. Apart from that, there was not much else.They had perfectly resolved the Goblin crisis, but the Popular Support of Logue Village was only at 50. As such, Zhao Fu ordered some people to go back and bring some food. The Goblins, who had gone hungry for a few days, immediately leapt at the food and ravenously ate, causing Popular Support to rise by 10 points.Following this, Zhao Fu took his people back to the Great Qin Village. Due to the Goblins, they had stopped all construction for the past few days, so now they resumed working. The main tasks were to cut wood, build houses, and start farming land. Zhao Fu also sent a team of soldiers to patrol the Great Qin Village\u2019s surroundings to see if there were any dangers.After giving out orders, Zhao Fu did not have much to do. He looked at the two skills he had obtained from his Demon Priest profession. One was Hell Fireball, D- grade, and the other was Blood Healing, E+ grade.Skills were also split into 9 major grades and 3 sub-grades. Zhao Fu obtained Fireball, an F grade skill, from the Violent Flame Rabbit, so he wanted to see the strength of his new D- grade skill, Hell Fireball.Zhao Fu went to an empty piece of land and spread out his hands. A blood-coloured fireball appeared in his hands, and he threw it.Bang! When the fireball landed on the ground, an explosion sounded out as a one meter wide crater appeared. It was at least four times stronger than a normal Fireball, which could only leave behind a black mark on the ground.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs for Blood Healing, it was a skill from Hell that was similar to a normal Priest\u2019s healing skill.After trying out his two new skills, Zhao Fu felt that it was a pity that there was a limit on the number of people with this profession. Also, in the Heaven Awaken World, Magic skills were quite rare, and they were worth 10 or so times more than Physical skills. Zhao Fu hoped that he would be able to create a Mage group in the future.Zhao Fu decided to spend the rest of his time cultivating. Bai Qi was already at the peak of Stage 0-2 and about to step into Stage 0-3, while he was still at Stage 0. [TLN: Stage 0-2 denotes \u2018Stage 0, Step 2\u2019]At lower levels, cultivation was not very important, but in the future, it could determine the fate of an entire nation. Thousands of normal soldiers would not be able to defeat a single Stage 9 soldier, and the normal soldiers would just be annihilated. If a nation did not have soldiers with high cultivation, it would be difficult for the nation to stand firmly.Right now, the Great Qin Village did not have many people, and having a single person who could fight was already not bad. However, after they had more people and things stabilized, Zhao Fu would start training elite troops.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Fu arranged for him to change his profession to Scholar. Now, the Great Qin Village had 110 residents, 47 soldiers, and 4 Scholars.Furthermore, after cultivating for the past few days, Zhao Fu\u2019s cultivation was now at Stage 0-1.Name: Zhao FuTitle: NoneProfession: Demon PriestAchievement Points: Commoner (53/200)Race: HumanAge: 21 (100)Stats: Strength: 8, Intelligence: 11, Constitution: 7, Agility: 9Special Power: [Weak \u2013 Demon\u2019s Power]Cultivation: Stage 0-1Cultivation Technique: Great Qin MantraSkills: Hell Fireball, Basic Sword Technique\u2026Equipment: Iron Sword\u2026After looking at his stats, Zhao Fu went to the Research Workshop. In order to research Taming, Zhao Fu had given one of the buildings to the Scholars and had caught a few wild rabbits and chickens for them to study.\u201cHow was elder Bai\u2019s research been coming along?\u201d Zhao Fu asked one of the elders with white hair. The elder\u2019s name was Bai Shan, and he was the first B grade villager that the Great Qin Village had summoned.Bai Shan was holding a wild chicken and turned to look at Zhao Fu, a look of delight on his face as he replied, \u201cYour Majesty, we\u2019ve made great progress. We\u2019ll definitely have Taming researched within 3 days!\u201dWhen Zhao Fu heard this, he felt at ease and went to the farming area. Surprisingly, apart from the Great Qin villagers working there, there were also some female Goblins helping.Li Si came over and explained, \u201cYour Majesty, the Goblin Village has very few Goblins who can fight right now, and they are severely lacking food. Logue and I agreed that the female Goblins who have nothing to do could come work here in exchange for some food.\u201dZhao Fu smiled and nodded. He felt quite satisfied when he that saw the Great Qin Village was developing in an orderly matter. Luckily, Zhao Fu had Li Si to take care of things, or he would have been inundated with matters, causing him endless headaches.Zhao Fu didn\u2019t have much to do, so he summoned Bai Qi and a group of soldiers and brought them to patrol around the Great Qin Village.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.In the real world, the entire Li family in Beitang City was incredibly pleased because its bloodline had received the Great Tang Empire\u2019s legacy.The Great Tang Imperial Family bloodline had become an incredibly large clan after so many years, and it was split into a few different branches, one of which was in Beitang City.Within a villa\u2019s hall, a few elders were sitting on a sofa. Beside them sat a middle-aged man named Li Zhe, who had a small goatee, and a beautiful woman. The woman was Li Zhe\u2019s current wife, Zhang Shuyun.Some other people were also inside the hall. They were all part of this branch of the Li family, and their gazes were all on the handsome youth in the hall.The youth looked like he was twenty years old, and he had a steady and calm temperament. He gave off an air of maturity that exceeded his age \u2013 this was Li Zhe\u2019s second son, Li Baiqing.Li Baiqing and his father Li Zhe were different types of people. Li Baiqing did not have any of his father\u2019s pompousness, and he handled things in a calm and mature manner. Li Baiqing was also quite talented, and he was one of Beitang City\u2019s Three Geniuses. Adding on his handsome appearance, he was someone who all the girls in Beitang City dreamed to be with. What was especially important about him was that he had obtained the Great Tang Empire\u2019s legacy.\u201cWho would have thought that so many of our family members would fail, but Qing\u2019Er was able to succeed and obtained our ancestor\u2019s legacy. This is our family\u2019s great blessing,\u201d an elder with a ruddy face said as he laughed heartily.Hearing his words, everyone else nodded in agreement. A pleased look appeared on Li Zhe\u2019s face; even though he wasn\u2019t capable, his son had brought him much face.\u201cGrandpa! Our ancestor\u2019s legacy is actually quite easy to obtain. As long as you maintain your focus and don\u2019t let yourself be tempted by external things, you\u2019ll pass the trial,\u201d Li Baiqing said with a humble and mild tone.The elder laughed, \u201cAlright, Qing\u2019Er, you don\u2019t need to be humble. Right now, none of the Li family members are even half as good as you. Fame follows merit, and we attach a lot of importance to you. We\u2019ll give you all of our resources so that you can develop well and bring glory to the Great Tang Empire.\u201dLi Baiqing nodded earnestly, and he understood just how heavy the burden he shouldered was. He also understood that this was the wish of his family\u2019s ancestors \u2013 rebuilding the Great Tang Empire \u2013 and that he had to complete it.Following this, the family gathering concluded. The elder was sitting in a room and said to his white-haired butler, \u201cHave you investigated the matter I left to you?\u201dThe butler nodded and handed some documents to the elder.The elder took the documents and scanned them before saying in surprise, \u201cWho would have thought that my illegitimate child would actually be somewhat capable. That brat, Li Zhe, fathered two good sons!\u201d\u201cGo find him and ask him to join the Li family. After all, he has our bloodline, and we might be able to use him in the future,\u201d the elder said to the butler.The butler paused before saying, \u201cSir! This might be quite difficult \u2013 after all, that year\u2026\u201dWhen the elder heard this, he sighed and said, \u201cBack then, that brat, Li Zhe, acted quite excessively. How about this: ask him what he wants. The Li family will try to satisfy and compensate his mother and him.\u201dThe butler hesitated before asking, \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t agree?\u201dThe elder thought for a moment before replying, \u201cIf he continues to refuse, just let him be for now. However, if he dares to obstruct Qing\u2019Er\u2019s path, we\u2019ll have to kill him.\u201dThe butler nodded and then left the room.Elsewhere, in a simple and unadorned room, six elders sat on chairs facing each other. One of the elders roared in anger, \u201cAll of the members of our family, the Ying family, have entered the Heaven Awaken World, but none of them received our ancestor\u2019s Legacy Trial. If they failed the Legacy Trial, that would just mean that we are useless, and we wouldn\u2019t have anything to say. However, they didn\u2019t even have an opportunity to attempt it!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? Someone has already obtained the Great Qin Empire\u2019s legacy!\u201d An elderly woman calmly replied.\u201cWhat? The Great Qin Empire\u2019s legacy was taken by an outsider?\u201d The elderly man who originally spoke loudly roared.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe skinny elder couldn\u2019t keep listening and said, \u201cOld Jiang, can you calm down? What do you mean by outsider? How can someone without the Great Qin Imperial Family\u2019s bloodline obtain our ancestor\u2019s legacy? It must be that the bloodline has been spread outside of the main family after thousands of years.\u201dThe plump old man sighed, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s virtually impossible to find out who has obtained the Great Qin ancestor\u2019s legacy. I hope that he reveals something so that we can find him in the Heaven Awaken World.\u201dThe other elders all looked quite restless but decided that there was nothing they could do about it.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the Heaven Awaken World, Zhao Fu once again gathered his soldiers because he had discovered another Goblin Village. There were not many Goblins in this village, only around 160 Goblins or so, so Zhao Fu and his soldiers would be able to capture it easily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123Zhao Fu brought the Great Qin Village\u2019s soldiers as well as Logue Village\u2019s Goblins to surround the little village. This Goblin Village only had 70 or so Goblin Soldiers, and the rest were female, elderly, or young Goblins.\u201cLogue! Go and persuade them to surrender.\u201dAdding on Logue Village\u2019s Goblins, Zhao Fu\u2019s overall forces completely surpassed this village\u2019s forces. What\u2019s more, he had all sorts of professions, so it would be incredibly easy to capture this village. However, it would be better to conquer it without any casualties.\u201cYes, Your Majesty!\u201d Old Logue respectfully replied to Zhao Fu, replying just like how the Great Qin Villagers did. He then walked up and said in a loud voice, \u201cYou have been surrounded and have no chance at victory. Surrender now, and don\u2019t make any needless sacrifices.\u201dHowever, just as Old Logue finished speaking, the Goblins within the village started to furiously clamor, and they looked as if they were cursing at Old Logue. Because they weren\u2019t Zhao Fu\u2019s people, there were no translations, so he could not understand what they were saying.Zhao Fu frowned and asked Old Logue, \u201cWhat are they cursing at?\u201dOld Logue nodded and replied, \u201cYour Majesty, they\u2019re saying that I\u2019m the scum of the Goblin race and a disgrace to all Goblins for attacking them together with the cunning humans.\u201dZhao Fu coldly harrumphed in reply. Since the Goblins weren\u2019t willing to surrender, Zhao Fu would have to act. Zhao Fu looked at Bai Qi, giving him the signal.Bai Qi yelled, \u201cArrange the formation! Prepare the fire arrows!\u201dThe Shieldbearers lifted up their shields and walked forwards with the Infantry following behind them. The Archers in the third row lit up their arrows and drew their bows in unison.\u201cFire!\u201dAs the command sounded out, the fire arrows were loosed into the air. The fire arrows were not aimed at the Goblins; rather, they were aimed at the houses. Instantly, the wooden houses caught on fire, causing the village to fall into chaos.Immediately afterwards, arrows started to rain down and hit the Goblins. When Old Logue saw Goblin after Goblin fall, he felt quite joyful that they had surrendered. Otherwise, this would have been the outcome for Logue Village.By now, the Goblins within the village had no other choice but to charge the encirclement.When the Archers, Zhao Fu, and Old Logue saw a wave of Goblins charge out of the village, the Archers orderly shot at the Goblins while Zhao Fu and Old Logue released Hell Fireballs. What surprised Zhao Fu was that two basketball-sized blood-colored fireballs appeared when Old Logue raised his wooden staff, and they gave off a fearsome aura.Following this, Old Logue waved his staff and the two blood-colored fireballs shot out, falling into the wave of Goblins. Because the Goblins were grouped so densely together, the two fireballs sent ten or so Goblins flying. Five or six of them became a bloodied mess, and they did not look like they could live for much longer.The fireballs that Old Logue cast came from practicing that skill to its limit. Zhao Fu rejoiced that he had not chosen to attack Logue Village back then. Otherwise, with Old Logue and the blood-colored altar, his forces would have been heavily wounded.However, none of this was important right now. Zhao Fu\u2019s Hell Fireballs were not as devastating as Old Logue\u2019s, and they only blew away seven or eight goblins.At this moment, Bai Qi led the Shieldbearers and Infantry to rush up and force the Goblins back.\u201cLogue! Ask them again if they want to surrender.\u201d Zhao Fu said to Old Logue when he saw the fear and panic in the Goblins\u2019 eyes.Old Logue walked up and loudly said, \u201cNow that you\u2019ve seen the esteemed Majesty\u2019s might, surrender now; His Majesty won\u2019t treat you unfairly.\u201dMany Goblins had instantly died, and when the surviving Goblins saw the ferocious soldiers in front of them and the large fires behind them, they realized that they would either be burned to death or killed by the soldiers. Moreover, since Old Logue seemed to be doing quite well, they felt that Zhao Fu would not treat them poorly. In the end, they put down their weapons and knelt on the ground.\u201cSystem announcement! Jean Village has surrendered to you. Would you like to accept?\u201dZhao Fu smiled. He understood that Outlanders would only submit to the strong. After displaying enough strength, they would naturally surrender.\u201cYou have accepted Jean Village\u2019s surrender. You have received 50 Achievement Points!\u201d\u201cBai Qi, I\u2019ll leave things here to you. Take some people and extinguish the fires; I\u2019m going to go out for a bit!\u201d Zhao Fu realized that he had not exited the Heaven Awaken World for almost one day in the real world, so he left the matters here to Bai Qi.Bai Qi nodded and took some people to extinguish the fires. Following this, Zhao Fu left the Heaven Awaken World.Even though Zhao Fu could eat and fill his stomach in the Heaven Awaken World, it did not affect his status in the real world. Zhao Fu still needed to eat in the real world, or he would starve to death.After Zhao Fu\u2019s mind returned to his body, hunger assaulted his entire body and mind. He sat up from his bed and decided that he wanted to have something different for a change after eating fast food from downstairs for the past few days.However, when Zhao Fu opened the door, a white-haired elder wearing a suit appeared before him. When Zhao Fu saw the elder, he remembered that the elder was the Li family\u2019s butler, so his expression became cold as he asked, \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201dThe butler did not mind Zhao Fu\u2019s attitude and said, \u201cSir wants you to return to the Li family. No matter what it is, the Li family will compensate you and your mother.\u201d\u201cCompensation?\u201dZhao Fu felt enraged when he heard this. He gritted his teeth and clenched his fists as he asked, \u201cWhat can compensate my mother\u2019s death? What can compensate my mother\u2019s pain? What can compensate all of my mother\u2019s tears?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go!\u201d Zhao Fu replied coldly.Seeing how Zhao Fu looked, the butler sighed and said, \u201cAlright! However, I hope that you\u2019ll be able to control your emotions and not do anything contrary to the Li family\u2019s interests. Otherwise\u2026\u201dThe butler did not continue, but Zhao Fu knew what he meant. If he went against the Li family\u2019s interests, they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill him.Zhao Fu\u2019s heart felt incredibly cold. He had wanted to abide by his mother\u2019s last words by not making any trouble for the Li family because he didn\u2019t want his mother to feel pained in the afterlife. However, they had come to threaten him. Yes, he did not have the strength to retaliate in the real world, but after the real world was devoured, as long as the Great Qin Village grew, it was not certain who would kill who.However, the butler had reminded him out of kindness, and Zhao Fu nodded to indicate that he understood.Following this, the butler left. Zhao Fu went to one of the fast food takeaway places and bought a meal. After getting home, he ate while reading the Heaven Awaken World forum on his computer to see if there was any news and to observe the current situation in China.By now, many powers had entered the Heaven Awaken World, and they had started creating factions. There was also something called the Heaven\u2019s Pride Rankings. Everyone on the Heaven\u2019s Pride Rankings was a dragon or phoenix, and those on it had extraordinary statuses with powerful families behind them.Number 1, Great Xia\u2019s inheritor\u2026 Si Ji!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNumber 2, Great Shang\u2019s inheritor\u2026 Di Wutian!Number 3, Great Zhou\u2019s inheritor\u2026 Ji Shenming!Number 4, Great Han\u2019s inheritor\u2026 Liu Ye!\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Out of these four people, two were enemies. The Heaven\u2019s Pride Rankings were currently based on the family\u2019s power; the most powerful families were also the oldest. According to this ranking, Great Qin\u2019s Ying family should have been fourth, but the Ying family did not receive the Great Qin\u2019s legacy, so they were currently desperately looking for Great Qin\u2019s inheritor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Someone had drawn a rough map detailing the layout of China and the surrounding countries. Zhao Fu looked southwest of China: that was where he was going to go after leaving China.Following this, Zhao Fu stopped looking at the news and entered the Heaven Awaken World.\u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re here. One of our villagers was injured by an Outlander. Luckily, Bai Qi was able to capture a few of them,\u201d Li Si reported as soon as Zhao Fu entered.Zhao Fu was quite surprised. The villagers all stayed around the Great Qin Village and didn\u2019t go too far, and Zhao Fu had sent people to patrol the surrounding region. There should be no danger, so where did these Outlanders come from?Feeling quite confused, Zhao Fu followed Li Si and found Bai Qi.Bai Qi was currently ordering people to use ropes to bind a few Gnomes. They were a bit taller than Goblins and were quite skinny. Their skin was gray-black, and they looked quite ugly.\u201cBai Qi! What\u2019s going on?\u201d Zhao Fu walked up and asked.When Bai Qi looked over and saw that Zhao Fu had arrived, he cupped his hands respectfully as he explained, \u201cYour Majesty, our villagers were picking wild fruits when suddenly a few Outlanders appeared and used crossbows to injure our villagers.\u201dAfter saying this, Bai Qi ordered one of the soldiers to hand Zhao Fu a small crossbow. Zhao Fu took it and saw that it was quite elaborate. There were no blueprints for this kind of crossbow, so it was impossible to make them.\u201cDid you get much out of questioning them?\u201d Zhao Fu asked.Bai Qi shook his head as he replied, \u201cYour Majesty, because we speak different languages, we haven\u2019t been able to get much information out of them. However, I\u2019ve already sent people to investigate the place where these Gnomes appeared.\u201dJust at this moment, someone came and reported that they had found a hidden tunnel.Hearing this, Zhao Fu took a few people and went to the hidden tunnel. It was about one meter tall, and there was tall grass hiding it, making it quite difficult to find.They also brought the Gnomes with them, and they all had ugly looks on their faces as if this place was very important to them.Seeing this, Zhao Fu understood that the Gnomes had been hiding in there. However, Zhao Fu did not dare to rashly enter: they did not know how many Gnomes were inside and the tunnel was only one meter tall, so they could only enter one at a time, which was quite dangerous.Zhao Fu chose a Gnome and ordered to have him whipped. As the whip struck the Gnome, it immediately lacerated the Gnome\u2019s skin, causing it to howl. After a few moments, Zhao Fu received a system announcement.\u201cSystem announcement! Gnome Dorje has surrendered to you. Would you like to accept?\u201dWhen Zhao Fu heard this system announcement, he chose to accept and ordered to have him brought over to him. Right now, the Gnome\u2019s Loyalty was only 10, but Zhao Fu did not mind. What he wanted was not his loyalty but the ability to understand his language.\u201cHow many Gnomes are there in your village?\u201d Zhao Fu asked.The Gnome felt quite conflicted, but he saw that the ferocious-looking soldier was about to whip him again, he said, \u201cRespected lord, Dorun village has 96 villagers. 46 of them are soldiers and the rest are females, elderly, and children.\u201d\u201cSo they only have that many people. No wonder they don\u2019t dare to live above ground.\u201dZhao Fu nodded and said to the Gnome, \u201cI\u2019ll release one of you. Tell them that I don\u2019t want to harm any of you, but all of you must submit to me.\u201dThe Gnome nodded and walked over to the other bound Gnomes and talked to them in his language, communicating Zhao Fu\u2019s intentions. Zhao Fu then chose one of them and allowed him to enter the tunnel.\u201cShieldbearers, surround the tunnel. Be careful of any crossbow bolts at any time!\u201d Zhao Fu ordered as the wait began.Time gradually passed, but after an hour, no Gnomes came out to surrender.Zhao Fu\u2019s expression darkened, and he said to Bai Qi, \u201cLooks like the Gnomes don\u2019t intend on surrendering. Go and prepare some hay to smoke them out.\u201dBai Qi nodded and gave the order to prepare hay and to start burning it at the tunnel. The dense smoke slowly drifted into the tunnel, but soon, it was no longer able to enter \u2013 it seemed that the Gnomes had blocked off the tunnel.\u201cThese Gnomes!\u201dZhao Fu coldly harrumphed and ordered his people to block off the tunnel before asking if there were other secret passages that led to the Gnome Village. Most Gnomes did not know about these passages, and only a few elderly Gnomes in the village knew. As such, even if they dug their way in, the Gnomes could still escape through other tunnels.Facing this sort of situation, Zhao Fu was not completely helpless. He called over 10 Goblin Warriors \u2013 now that he controlled two Goblin Villages, his forces now had 10 Goblin Warriors because each Goblin Village could have five Goblin Warriors.After calling the Goblin Warriors over, Zhao Fu ordered them to use their massive stone hammers to smash the ground where Zhao Fu believed their village to be in order to collapse their tunnels and bury the Gnome Village. In a few days, they could take care of the corpses.Of course, the Gnomes could dig new tunnels, so Zhao Fu ordered the 10 Goblin Warriors to immediately smash any tunnels as soon as they were discovered. That way, the Gnomes would not be able to escape.Following this, Zhao Fu locked up the captured Gnomes. Because the Gnome that surrendered had incredibly low Loyalty and might escape at any moment, he was also locked up. However, Zhao Fu still treated him decently by giving him enough food and water because he surrendered. As for the other Gnomes, they could go hungry for a few days.After returning to the village, Zhao Fu, Bai Qi, and Li Si started to discuss the information that Zhao Fu had gained from the Heaven Awaken World forum.BOOM!!Suddenly, a massive explosion sounded out, causing everyone in the Great Qin Village to become quite shocked.Zhao Fu quickly came out and took some people over to where the explosion had come from. He saw a dazed few Goblin Warriors staring at a 10 meter long by 50 or so meter deep crack. Cold air could be felt from the crack, giving off an eerie feeling.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zhao Fu asked the Goblin Warriors.One of the Goblin Warriors grunted back a string of words that meant that they had just been following Zhao Fu\u2019s orders by smashing the ground with their hammers. One of the Goblin Warriors had struck down with all of his might, and it had someone done this.\u201cSystem announcement! Dorun Village has surrendered to you. Would you like to accept?\u201dZhao Fu\u2019s train of thought was cut off by the system announcement. He thought to himself, \u201cLooks like they had to suffer a bit before they were willing to submit.\u201dZhao Fu accepted and told his people to start digging.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were many small tunnels connected to this cavern, and they looked like rooms. Because of the massive crack from above, a third of the cavern had collapsed.Zhao Fu found some Gnomes cowering with looks of terror on their faces. When the Gnomes saw Zhao Fu and the people he had brought with him, they obediently put down their weapons and knelt on the ground, signaling their intention to surrender.\u201cRespected lord, thank you for accepting our surrender and coming to save us,\u201d one of the elderly Gnomes said with an expression of gratitude.Zhao Fu had been quite annoyed at the Gnomes, but when he heard what the elder said, he decided to let it go. Since they had become his subordinates, he wouldn\u2019t hold it against them anymore, so he said, \u201cYou can all rise!\u201dSeeing that Zhao Fu was not angry at them and seemed to have forgiven them for their earlier resistance, the Gnomes let out a sigh of relief and stood up.Zhao Fu was quite interested in the Gnome\u2019s barracks, so he went there first. There, he found two Profession Change Stone Steles. They were:[Gnome Crossbowmen]: F grade Military. Description: Gnomes that use crossbows as their main weapon. Effect: Receives skill [Crossbow Mastery]The other one gave Zhao Fu a very pleasant surprise:[Gnome Mechanics Scholar]: E grade Military. Description: Gnomes proficient at mechanics. Effect: Receives skill [Mechanics Research]This profession was for creating large mechanical weapons. A weapon that Zhao Fu had always wanted to make was the ballista, an extremely powerful, cold weapon.The destructive power of a ballista was more than 10 times that of a normal bow. When facing such a weapon, most people could only step back in deference. Even though Zhao Fu wanted to create one, all complicated things in the Heaven Awaken World required blueprints. Even if he knew how to create one in the real world, without a blueprint, he would not be able to create one in the Heaven Awaken World.However, this problem was resolved because of the Gnome Mechanics Scholar profession. Of course, apart from ballistae, there were many other large-scale cold weapons. It was just a pity that the limit of the Gnome Mechanics Scholar profession was five people.After having a look at the Barracks, Zhao Fu went to their Storehouse. Apart from food, the Gnomes had a little less than 1,000 copper coins and had no silver coins. With a village of this size, it would be quite difficult for them to kill anything that could drop silver coins.After walking out of the Storehouse, Zhao Fu looked around the 100-meter wide cavern and said, \u201cThis place won\u2019t be able to last, so you should move above ground. We\u2019ll give you some basic protection.\u201dThe Gnome elders immediately agreed joyfully. How could they refuse the opportunity to be protected by people many times more powerful than them?Zhao Fu went to the Gnome Village\u2019s Village Hall and looked at the white cube hovering in the air. He stretched out his hand and two options appeared: [Destroy] and [Relocate].Destroying a village allowed one to gain 10% of the village\u2019s current EXP, but one would only gain a broken City Heart \u2013 the white cube in the air \u2013 and it could only be used to upgrade the grade of other villages.Five broken White grade City Hearts could upgrade a Normal grade Village to Blue grade; 10 Blue broken Blue grade City Hearts could upgrade a Blue grade Village to Silver grade; 30 broken Silver grade City Hearts could upgrade a Silver grade Village to Gold grade.There was no limit to this method of upgrading, and no one knew just how high one could upgrade their village. However, what was certain was that the higher the grade of a village, the more difficult it would be to upgrade it. If a Gold grade Village wanted to upgrade to a Legendary grade Village, it needed 120 broken Gold grade City Hearts as well as a Legendary grade item.This was incredibly difficult \u2013 after all, Gold grade Villages were not as common as cabbages, so most people would only be able to upgrade their village to Gold grade at most. It would be virtually impossible for them to upgrade to Legendary grade or above.On the other hand, if one chose to [Relocate] the village, one would still gain 10% of the village\u2019s current EXP and would be able to use the City Heart once, but the village\u2019s EXP would fall to 0. Advanced Villages would become Primary Villages, and Advanced Towns would become Primary Towns.The Gnome Village was still just a Primary Village, so there wasn\u2019t much to worry about. Zhao Fu decided to [Relocate] it.The City Heart shined with a faint white light that covered the entire village, and the basic structures started to slowly disappear.\u201cSystem Announcement! The Great Qin Village has obtained 120 EXP!\u201dBy now, the Great Qin Village had accumulated more than 1,000 EXP, and it was about 3,000 EXP away from leveling up to an Intermediate Village. Zhao Fu looked over at the City Heart, which no longer gave off a white light and instead silently floated there.Zhao Fu picked it up and looked at it:[City Heart]: Grade: White, Race Restricted To: GnomesHumans could not use another race\u2019s City Heart to create a village, nor could other races use a human City Heart to create a village. Moreover, if a village was occupied by a different race, it would not gain new villagers. As such, Zhao Fu always left the corresponding race in charge of its village after the village surrendered.Zhao Fu handed the City Heart to the Gnome elders and told them to move closer to the Great Qin Village when they rebuilt their village.After leaving the cavern, Zhao Fu and Bai Qi looked around the large crack.The crack was about 17 meters long and was 50 or so meters deep. Because it was so deep, sunlight did not reach the bottom, so it was quite dark below. However, they could barely make out what seemed to be orderly roads made out of brick.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Zhao Fu frowned as he asked Bai Qi.Bai Qi replied with a serious expression, \u201cYour Majesty, I feel that this large crack isn\u2019t simple.\u201dZhao Fu fell deep into thought. Since this crack was so close to the Great Qin Village, if they did not investigate it and there happened to be something dangerous within it, they would not be able to react in time if anything happened. Zhao Fu didn\u2019t want to leave a ticking time bomb by his side, so he said, \u201cI want to go down and see what\u2019s down there.\u201dBai Qi immediately replied worriedly, \u201cYour Majesty! Let me come with you.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu nodded and told his people to prepare some ropes and torches before he slowly started climbing down.An hour or so later, Zhao Fu and Bai Qi arrived at the bottom and found that there was a passage made of brick that was 10 meters wide and 4 meters tall.It was quite dark, so Zhao Fu and Bai Qi lit their torches and walked towards the passage. As they walked, their surroundings became darker and darker. If it wasn\u2019t for their torches, they would not have been able to see their fingers even if they were right in front of their faces. It was deathly quiet around them, and the atmosphere became quite strange.Suddenly, creaking and cracking sounds could be heard. Zhao Fu waved his torch around and saw a slowly swaying Skeleton Swordsman that had blue tongues of flames in its head and a rusty sword.The Skeleton Swordsman turned to look at Zhao Fu and Bai Qi with its hollow eye sockets and saw that they were two living beings. It howled and raised the sword in its hands as it rushed towards them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, it was quite agile and appeared right in front of Zhao Fu and Bai Qi in a few moments. Bai Qi quickly blocked the path to Zhao Fu and unsheathed his sword, meeting the Skeleton Swordsman in battle.Facing Bai Qi, the Skeleton Swordsman slashed down with its sword.Bai Qi lifted his sword to block the Skeleton Swordsman\u2019s strike, after which the Skeleton Swordsman brought its sword back and savagely slashed at Bai Qi numerous times. Clanging sounds continuously rang out as the Skeleton Swordsman and Bai Qi fought. The Skeleton Swordsman was completely focused on offense and had no regard for defense at all.After blocking the Skeleton Swordsman\u2019s attacks a few times, Bai Qi started to become familiar with the Skeleton Swordsman\u2019s attack patterns. As the Skeleton Swordsman slashed downwards, Bai Qi pivoted his body, his sword covered with a trace of sword qi, as he slashed upwards.Bang!!The Skeleton Swordsman was sent flying six or seven meters away and fell to the ground. However, only a few of its ribs were broken, and it still seemed fine. It twisted its bones and slowly started to stand up.At this moment, Zhao Fu launched a blood-colored fireball at the Skeleton Swordsman. An explosion sounded out as the Skeleton Swordsman was once again sent flying.However, after falling to the ground, the Skeleton Swordsman once again twisted its bones and started to stand up. Zhao Fu was about to release another Hell Fireball when he realized that he would not be able to fire them that quickly, so he chose to use normal Fireballs.An orange-colored fireball flew towards the Skeleton Swordsman, hitting it when it was about to stand up again. This time, however, the Skeleton Swordsman did not stand up again, and it was instead blasted into a pile of bones.A blue tongue of fire flickered within the pile of bones, and after walking up to it, Zhao Fu saw its information:[Refined Martial Soul]: After using it, one can obtain one or more skills that the owner had during his or her lifetime.So it was a Refined Martial Soul. After seeing this information, Zhao Fu understood that Refined Martial Souls were things that were created during someone\u2019s lifetime when he or she practiced a skill to the point that it fused with his or her soul. After the owner became an Undead, anyone who killed him or her would be able to obtain that skill.The difference between this skill and a normal skill was that one would only be able to fully grasp normal skills through a lot of practice. However, after using a Refined Martial Soul, one would gain a skill that they would become proficient in immediately.The Skeleton Swordsman was clearly a melee profession. Zhao Fu knew that he was not suited to melee battles and his stats made him more suited for Magic, so he gave the Refined Martial Soul to Bai Qi.He then looked curiously at the rusty sword and picked it up.[Taiqing Sword]: Grade: Blue, Stats: Strength +1, Description: A Gold grade weapon that became rusty after over 10,000 years, becoming a Blue grade weapon.\u201cWhat? This was a Gold grade weapon before?\u201dZhao Fu felt quite shocked. Who would have thought that this rusty sword, which looked almost useless, had previously been a Gold grade weapon? It was only because of the passage of time that it had fallen to Blue grade and become so rusty.There weren\u2019t even any Gold grade weapons in the market, and a Silver grade weapon was worth thousands of silver coins. At the very least, Gold grade weapons were worth hundreds, if not thousands, of times more than Silver grade weapons. At the minimum, Gold grade weapons would be worth 1,000 gold coins.Even though 1,000 gold coins did not seem like much, in the Heaven Awaken World, 100 copper coins were worth 1 silver coin and 100 silver coins were worth 1 gold coin. Thus, 1 gold coin was worth 10,000 copper coins and 1,000 gold coins would be worth 10 million copper coins. Based on the current exchange rate of $10 in the real world for 1 copper coin, at the very least, a Gold grade weapon would be worth $100 million. However, currently, even if someone had $100 million, all he or she could do was dream about buying a Gold grade weapon.Zhao Fu looked at the Taiqing Sword with pity while feeling quite curious. Why did a random Skeleton have a weapon that was once a Gold grade weapon? Zhao Fu said, \u201cBai Qi, fuse with that Refined Martial Soul and see what sort of skill you receive.\u201dBai Qi nodded and closed his eyes, pressing the Refined Martial Soul against his chest. The blue tongue of flame slowly fused into his body, and after a while, Bai Qi opened his eyes and said happily, \u201cYour Majesty! I received a B grade skill: Qi Slash!\u201d\u201cWhat? A B grade skill?\u201d This caused Zhao Fu to feel quite shocked.When Zhao Fu thought of how powerful his D- grade skill, Hell Fireball, was, he could only imagine how powerful a B grade skill would be. Zhao Fu became even more curious as to what sort of place this place was.Zhao Fu and Bai Qi raised their torches and advanced. A few minutes later, they encountered another skeleton lying on the ground with a blue tongue of fire in its head. It raised its rusty saber and twisted its bones, about to stand up.Zhao Fu immediately launched a Hell Fireball at it, sending it flying.The Skeleton soldier was about to stand up when Bai Qi rushed up and unleashed his new skill, Qi Slash.A wave of white sword qi burst forth from the sword, slashing into the Skeleton soldier\u2019s chest.Bang!The Skeleton soldier was sent flying backwards by more than 10 meters. Its body instantly collapsed, fragmenting into tiny pieces of bone. This Skeleton soldier did not have a Refined Martial Soul, but it dropped its large saber, which Zhao Fu picked up.[Hundred Mountain Sabre]: Grade: Blue, Stats: Constitution +1, Description: A Gold grade weapon that became rusty after over 10,000 years, becoming a Blue grade weapon.Indeed, this was yet another weapon that had once been a Gold grade weapon. Just what was this place? Zhao Fu felt more and more curious.Filled with curiosity, Zhao Fu and Bai Qi continued exploring. They encountered a few more Skeletons, and after killing them, they obtained two more Refined Martial Souls, and their weapons were also all weapons that had been Gold grade weapons in the past that had become Blue grade weapons due to the passage of time.After obtaining the two Refined Martial Souls, Zhao Fu used one that had been dropped by a Skeleton Archer and received the C- grade skill \u2018Rock Crushing Arrows\u2019.This place was like a treasure trove. Here, they could obtain many Blue grade weapons and good skills. A Blue grade weapon was worth between 100 to 1,000 silver coins, while this sort of weapon, which used to be a Gold grade weapon, could be sold for around 300 silver coins.In this expedition, they had obtained six weapons and three Refined Martial Souls. Just Bai Qi\u2019s B grade skill was worth more than 10 gold coins. Altogether, the things they had obtained were worth roughly 31 gold coins, which was 310,000 copper coins.Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but feel delighted after gaining such a haul. He had wanted to continue with Bai Qi, but as they progressed, they discovered more and more Skeleton groups. Smaller groups had five or six Skeletons, while larger groups had 20 to 30 Skeletons. For the sake of their safety, Zhao Fu and Bai Qi decided to leave for now.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026After returning to the surface, Zhao Fu ordered his people to hide this place and to construct a set of stairs so that large numbers of people could enter in the future.Following this, Zhao Fu took the six rusty weapons to the Smithy and asked if they could be repaired.When Wang Dawu took the weapons and examined them, he looked incredibly shocked, but there was also a hint of pity on his face \u2013 such good weapons had fallen to such a state. After looking over them, Wang Dawu nodded and said, \u201cI can give them a simple repair, but I need materials.\u201dThis made Zhao Fu feel quite awkward. Right now, most of the Great Qin Village\u2019s weapons were made of Iron Wood, and they barely had any iron weapons. Zhao Fu immediately sent people to look around to see if there were any open-pit iron mines nearby.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We\u2019ve finished researching Taming!\u201d After Zhao Fu gave those orders, Bai Shan ran over with an expression of joy on his face.When Zhao Fu heard this, he felt quite delighted. After waiting for so long, the Research Workshop was finally showing some results. He nodded and headed over to the Research Workshop, and there, he saw a few Scholars and a new stone stele.When the Scholars saw that Zhao Fu had arrived, they respectfully retreated to one side. Zhao Fu walked up and placed his hand on the stone stele, and some information was transmitted to his mind:[Tamer]: F+ grade Military. Description: Receives the ability to tame wild beasts. Effect: Receives skill [Taming].Seeing this, Zhao Fu brought two villagers to change their profession to Tamer and then ordered people to catch some wild ducks and geese to tame.Right now, the Great Qin Village severely lacked people. There were many things to do, so they had to use many of the Goblins to make up for their lack of people. As for exploring the crack, they were waiting for the stairs to be constructed before going in again.After going west of the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu went to have a look at the newly-constructed Gnome Village. The Gnomes all lowered their heads respectfully and retreated to one side. Zhao Fu found five Mechanics Scholars and instructed them to start researching ballistae.After returning to the Great Qin Village, Bai Shan came up and asked, \u201cYour Majesty, what would you like us to research next?\u201dZhao Fu had almost forgotten that the Scholars didn\u2019t have anything to do now that they had successfully researched Taming. There were simply too many matters to take care of, and Zhao Fu started to feel somewhat overwhelmed. After he thought for a moment, he replied to Bai Shan, \u201cStart researching teleportation channels!\u201dTeleportation channels were absolutely necessary. If the Great Qin Village could successfully research teleportation channels, they would make going from village to village more convenient, and Zhao Fu also needed to be able to visit a main city. Right now, they had nowhere to spend the money they had earned, so he wanted to go to a main city to see what they could buy.After receiving his orders, Bai Shan took his people and returned to the Workshop to start researching.At this moment, someone came up to report that they had discovered a Human Village about five kilometers north of the Great Qin Village.Zhao Fu immediately took some people to have a look. He wanted to determine if it was an ordinary village or a village of bandits. However, no matter what it was, Zhao Fu wanted to gain some more villagers from this village. Relying on the summoning each day was too slow, and the Great Qin Village greatly lacked villagers.An hour or so later, they arrived at the Human Village. They stood on higher ground and looked down at the village, and Zhao Fu inwardly muttered, \u201cOutlander villages can\u2019t compare to human villages at all.\u201dFor defense, the village had thick wooden boards as walls, and there were people on alert patrolling around. As soon as there was an enemy attack, they would immediately sound the alarm. The guards were also densely gathered because their village was in the wilderness. Because of this, they were constantly surrounded by danger, so they had to focus on defense.The village had around 400 people. There were around 60 elderly and children and around 160 women. The other 200 or so people were men, making the village seem more like an ordinary village than a bandit village. Moreover, most of the guards had leather armor and iron sabers, so the village was much more prosperous than the Great Qin Village. After all, the Great Qin Village was still using weapons made of Iron Wood, and the soldiers only had 10 or so sets of leather armor.Most of the soldiers were Militia, but a few of them held bows and arrows and a few others held shields, though they did not have the corresponding profession. Archers, Shieldbearers, and Cavalry needed to be researched or unlocked when a village leveled up. Intermediate Villages could unlock Shieldbearers, Advanced Villages could unlock Archers, and Towns could unlock Cavalry.Right now, those who were holding bows and arrows and shields were relying on their own efforts and skills. They did not have the profession stats or skills, making them half as effective as those with a profession.If Zhao Fu could conquer this village, he would be able to instantly gain the numbers he needed for the Great Qin Village. However, if he brought his people and attacked, he would be facing solid defenses and enemies with twice his numbers, so he would definitely lose many of his soldiers and most likely suffer defeat.It seemed that they would not be able to take care of things through fighting, so Zhao Fu turned and said, \u201cAll of you go and hide for now. Bai Qi and I will go negotiate with them!\u201dZhao Fu and Bai Qi headed to the entrance of the village, and the guards immediately called out in a loud voice, \u201cWho are you people?\u201dBai Qi was about to reply, but Zhao Fu signalled him to stop and said, \u201cI\u2019m the Village Chief of the Great Qin Village, a nearby village, and I\u2019ve come to visit your village. Could I trouble your Village Chief to meet with me?\u201dThe guards immediately went to report this matter, and after a while, the gates opened as a fair-skinned youth walked out and smiled at Zhao Fu, cupping his hands respectfully as he said, \u201cFather invites you in!\u201dZhao Fu returned the courtesy, after which he and Bai Qi followed the youth to a building. After walking in, they saw a white-bearded elder sitting down. When the elder saw Zhao Fu and Bai Qi, he stood up and smiled as he gestured with his hand for them to sit down, and the serving ladies brought some tea.\u201cI never thought that this village would receive such distinguished guests. I apologize for our poor hospitality,\u201d the elder said apologetically.Zhao Fu calmly smiled as he replied, \u201cVillage Chief is too courteous. Our village has not been here for too long, and we\u2019ve only just discovered your esteemed village and come to visit. We\u2019re quite late in doing so, so we hope you don\u2019t hold this against us.\u201dThe Village Chief felt quite surprised. \u201cThis old man was feeling quite curious why a village had suddenly appeared near us. So you\u2019ve only been here for a short period of time. In the wilderness, dangers lurk everywhere, and it\u2019s hard to find a place of safety.\u201dZhao Fu nodded and was just about to say something when a youth walked in with a serious expression, reporting, \u201cVillage Chief! The Wild Wolf Village\u2019s people have come demanding food again.\u201dThe elder\u2019s expression became serious and apologized to Zhao Fu and Bai Qi before leaving with the others.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Bai Qi said as he turned to look at Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu nodded and they followed the Village Chief outside. They saw 10 or so vicious-looking people standing there, and a big, dark-skinned, and ugly-looking thug roared, \u201cDamn old man, hand over your food!\u201dThe fair-skinned youth became furious and was about to step up to say something but was held back by the elder, who ordered, \u201cGive them the food!\u201dThe villagers complied with the elder\u2019s commands and brought out 10 or so sacks of food and placed them at the entrance of the village.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe thug laughed with satisfaction after seeing so many sacks of food and called out, \u201cYou\u2019re quite a smart one, damn old man.\u201d After speaking, the thug ordered the others to carry the sacks of food and left.When the fair-skinned youth saw them leave, he coldly harrumphed. Zhao Fu went up and asked what had just happened, and the situation was explained to him by the Village Chief.This village was called the Li Family Village, and the Village Chief was called Li Youcai, while the fair-skinned youth, his son, was called Li Wen.The Wild Wolf Village was a bandit village about eight kilometers away from the Li Family Village. The Wild Wolf Village had around 300 people, but as a bandit village, it essentially did not have any women, elderly, or children, and most of the 300 or so people were men. They were all bandits, rogues, and thugs, and they had quite a decent fighting force.If the Wild Wolf Village wanted to attack the Li Family Village, with their solid defenses, the Wild Wolf Village would still lose many people. The Li Family Village was also afraid that the bandits would pillage and destroy their village, so they had maintained a non-aggression pact. However, the Li Family Village needed to hand over a certain amount of food every month.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123Even though the Li Family Village and the Wild Wolf Village were \u2018at peace\u2019, the Li Family Village was in a weaker position, so the Wild Wolf Village was able to act so arrogantly. Of course, if the Wild Wolf Village found an opportunity, the men of the Wild Wolf Village would definitely break the current status quo and pillage the Li Family Village.Even though the Wild Wolf Village had been eyeing the Li Family Village for a while, it had never found an opportunity to act, and the Li Family Village had always been on its guard against the Wild Wolf Village.At this moment, Li Youcai kindly said to Zhao Fu, \u201cSir, your village will be discovered by them sooner or later. It\u2019s best that you make preparations now, or it\u2019ll be too late by the time they find you.\u201dSurprisingly, Zhao Fu lightly shook his head and said sincerely, \u201cVillage Chief Li, if I help you deal with the Wild Wolf Village, what will I get in return?\u201dHearing this, everyone around them looked over at Zhao Fu. Some had looks of doubt, others had looks of trust and gratitude, and several had looks of fear.\u201cSir, if you can help us destroy the Wild Wolf Village, the Li Family Village will follow you from now on!\u201d Li Wen said emotionally.Li Youcai quickly grabbed Li Wen and said, \u201cApologies, my son is young and insensible; please don\u2019t take his words seriously.\u201dZhao Fu smiled and asked, \u201cIn that case, Village Chief Li, what can I get if I destroy the Wild Wolf Village for you?\u201dLi Youcai hesitated. On one hand, he knew that the Wild Wolf Village had been eyeing the Li Family Village this entire time, and he wanted to find an opportunity to act against them. Li Youcai was not stupid, and he believed that the bandits would one day attack the Li Family Village. That was why they were defending with such fear every day. However, they couldn\u2019t keep going on like this \u2013 one day, the Wild Wolf Village would attack them, which was why they were attracted to Zhao Fu\u2019s words.Another one of his worries was that Zhao Fu would not be able to stand up to the Wild Wolf Village, resulting in the Wild Wolf Village directing its anger to the Li Family Village as well. In that case, the consequences would be unimaginable.Zhao Fu could tell that the Village Chief had his worries, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Village Chief Li, we won\u2019t need a single one of your soldiers, and even if something does happen, it won\u2019t affect the Li Family Village at all.\u201dWhen Li Youcai heard what Zhao Fu said, Li Youcai finally made up his mind and asked, \u201cWhat would you like in return?\u201dZhao Fu slightly smiled and said, \u201cI want the Li Family Village to join the Great Qin Village!\u201dLi Youcai hesitated and thought for a while before finally agreeing. If Zhao Fu could really destroy the Wild Wolf Village, the Li Family Village would join the Great Qin Village.After coming to this agreement, Zhao Fu and Bai Qi left the Li Family Village.After Zhao Fu left, some of the Li Family Village\u2019s villagers said with displeasure, \u201cThe Li Family Village is going to join another village just like that? Isn\u2019t this a bit too rushed? I\u2019m opposed to this!\u201dLi Youcai coldly harrumphed and said, \u201cYou idiot! If the Great Qin Village can easily destroy the Wild Wolf Village, then it must be very powerful. If that\u2019s the case, the Great Qin Village will be able to easily destroy the Li Family Village as well. Their visit this time was most likely diplomacy before violence, and if we hadn\u2019t agreed, it could have been us that was destroyed first.\u201dHearing this, everyone came to a sudden realization and felt quite fearful.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After Zhao Fu and Bai Qi left the Li Family Village, they found the Wild Wolf Village based on Li Youcai\u2019s directions. After observing it for a while, Zhao Fu smiled with a sense of confidence and returned to the Great Qin Village. He stopped everything that was going on and rapidly gave out commands.At night, when it had turned completely dark, a skinny youth in the Wild Wolf Village looked around to find a tree to relieve himself when he felt a sharp pain at the back of his head. He then fell to the ground and fainted.When he came to, he found that he was bound and in an unfamiliar place. There were a few people looking at him, and the youth seemed to detect something as he cried out, \u201cSirs, please spare me! I have nothing! Are you sure you haven\u2019t caught the wrong person?\u201dZhao Fu looked at the skinny youth and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201dWang Ergou felt that Zhao Fu was the leader here, so he quickly replied, \u201cSir, this lowly one is called Wang Ergou.\u201d\u201cVery good! Wang Ergou, I want you to help me with something. If you do it, there\u2019ll be many benefits for you in the future,\u201d Zhao Fu said with a slight smile.The Wild Wolf Village, a bandit village, was where the scum and dregs of society gathered, and none of its members felt much loyalty to it, so Wang Ergou quickly replied, \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ll do anything sir requires of me.\u201dWhen Zhao Fu heard this, he gave the order, \u201cUntie him!\u201dA soldier stepped forwards and undid the ropes tying up Wang Ergou, who stood there with his head subserviently lowered.\u201cI want you to put this in everyone\u2019s food at dinnertime tomorrow,\u201d Zhao Fu said as he handed Wang Ergou a bottle.Wang Ergou\u2019s face stiffened because he knew that Zhao Fu wanted him to poison everyone in the village. Wang Ergou\u2019s hands trembled as he received the bottle.At this moment, Zhao Fu also handed him a red pill and said, \u201cEat this!\u201dWang Ergou realized that this was not in his best interests, so he brightly smiled as he said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t necessary, is it, sir? Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll definitely do as you told me.\u201dOf course, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t trust his words. If Zhao Fu trusted a bandit like him, he would be sold out in a moment, so he coldly replied, \u201cYou can either eat it yourself or have someone help you!\u201dWang Ergou took the red pill, looked at it, and hesitated.Zhao Fu tilted his head, signaling the soldiers to \u2018help\u2019 Wang Ergou with it. Two soldiers stepped forwards, making Wang Ergou finally make up his mind. He swallowed the red pill, and a sullen expression appeared on his face.Zhao Fu took out a wild rabbit from a cage and fed it an identical red pill. He tossed the wild rabbit to Wang Ergou\u2019s side, and after a while, the wild rabbit hopped a few times before its body stiffened and it foamed at the mouth, blood coming out of its eyes as it died.This caused Wang Ergou\u2019s face to become as pale as a sheet. He understood that this would be his outcome if he did not complete this mission.\u201cThis is also for you. Don\u2019t worry; after you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll give you the antidote!\u201d Zhao Fu said as he handed Wang Ergou five silver coins.Wang Ergou nodded his head, and his hands shook as he received the silver coins. Following this, Zhao Fu ordered the soldiers to cover Wang Ergou\u2019s head and to take him back to where they had picked him up.The next day, Wang Ergou returned to the Wild Wolf Village with a pale face. Because he had been thinking about this matter the entire time, he was careless and bumped into a large thug. He was slapped to the ground, a fiery pain spreading through his face, causing him to come back to his senses and to be filled with resolve.Zhao Fu also started to gather all of his forces, including the Gnomes and Goblins, and waited for an opportunity.At night, within the Wild Wolf Village\u2019s Hall, a tough, fierce-looking thug sat at the head seat and roared in a loud voice, \u201cBrothers, eat and drink well tonight; tomorrow, we\u2019ll go to the Li Family Village and get a few women to play with!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes! Yes! Big bro!\u201dEveryone in the hall passionately responded, and the scene seemed quite lively.Outside of the Wild Wolf Village, Zhao Fu coldly stared at the Wild Wolf Village and said, \u201cBai Qi! Do you think that Wang Ergou will use the poison?\u201dBai Qi immediately lowered his head, cupped his fists, and said, \u201cThis subordinate doesn\u2019t dare to doubt Your Majesty\u2019s brilliant decisions!\u201dZhao Fu smiled and said, \u201cAlright, no need to use such formalities. Tell me what you really think.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123Bai Qi raised his head and said, \u201cI think Wang Ergou will most likely use the poison. Let alone a bandit village like this, even if it was an ordinary village, there would still be people willing to betray their village for personal benefits.\u201cThis subordinate greatly admires Your Majesty\u2019s plan. First, bandits don\u2019t cook their food separately like normal households, and they instead cook all of their food in a big batch, making it quite easy to poison everyone. Second, Your Majesty chose an unremarkable and minor person who no one would notice. Even though the lord can see everyone\u2019s Loyalty, he needs to manually check each person, making it difficult to detect Wang Ergou\u2019s betrayal. Third, Your Majesty used a brilliant carrot and stick strategy. The Great Qin Village hasn\u2019t created any poisons or antidotes. Your Majesty merely used a poisonous medicinal pill and a non-poisonous medicinal pill to scare Wang Ergou into submission, making him not dare to betray us. Your Majesty also used money, which bandits love most, to lure him in even further. From this, one can see that Your Majesty\u2019s schemes are brilliant. However\u2026\u201d Bai Qi stopped talking and paused.Zhao Fu nodded and said, \u201cGo on.\u201dBai Qi continued, \u201cThere\u2019s still a slight possibility that Wang Ergou won\u2019t follow through. After all, as the saying goes, \u2018planning is with man, but success is with heaven.\u2019 In case Wang Ergou doesn\u2019t use the poison and is discovered, we need to plan our attack carefully.\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d Zhao Fu replied. Bai Qi was right; this was exactly what Zhao Fu had been thinking as well, so they started to discuss their contingency strategy.Time gradually passed.The Wild Wolf Village\u2019s Hall had been incredibly lively when suddenly someone fell to the ground and coughed up blood before dying on the spot. After this, other people started falling to the ground and coughing up blood.The poison that Zhao Fu had given Wang Ergou was refined by Apothecary Zhang Baishu from the venom of 100 venomous snakes, and it was incredibly lethal.The thug sitting at the head seat was incredibly shocked, and he flipped the food in front of him to the ground. He shot up from his seat, and before he could say anything, someone outside reported, \u201cFire!\u201dAt this moment, the thug seemed to realize something. His expression darkened, and he drew his large saber and yelled at the few people who hadn\u2019t been poisoned, \u201cBrothers, let\u2019s go! I want to see who\u2019s daring enough to act against the Wild Wolf Village!\u201dOutside the village, Zhao Fu saw that a few wooden houses had started burning. This was what Zhao Fu had told Wang Ergou to do in order to let him know that the plan had succeeded.Under the cover of night, Zhao Fu immediately yelled, \u201cArchers, prepare the fire arrows; burn all of the houses in the Wild Wolf Village. Crossbowmen, take down the guards outside the Wild Wolf Village!\u201dThe 10 or so Archers obeyed and shot fire arrows towards the Wild Wolf Village, lighting the Wild Wolf Village\u2019s houses on fire, surprising the guards outside. Following this, the 40 or so Gnome Crossbowmen continuously released crossbow bolts, making it seem as if there was a rain of crossbow bolts. The bandits fell to the ground one after another, and they were shot full of holes like a wasp\u2019s nest.Zhao Fu was not in a hurry to attack. He once again gave the order to release fire arrows to set fire to all of the houses and told the Gnome Crossbowmen to fire at will.Zhao Fu did this to safeguard against any traps. Soon, the Wild Wolf Village was transformed into a sea of flames, and the Gnome Crossbowmen had shot quite a few rounds of crossbow bolts. All of the bandits who wanted to rush out of the Wild Wolf Village were all riddled with holes, causing them to retreat back to the village.At this moment, 10 fat, sturdy Goblin Warriors, who were two meters tall, raised their massive stone hammers and rushed into the village, wildly smashing whatever they saw, and they were backed by unstoppable momentum.Zhao Fu then gave the order for all troops to advance. Shieldbearers, Infantry, and Goblin Soldiers raised their weapons and cried out as they rushed into the village.\u201cSo it was you fellows! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dThe leader of the thugs saw his village completely drowned in flames, and when he saw Zhao Fu giving orders, he felt incredible hatred for him. He lifted his large saber and rushed over.When Bai Qi saw him run over, he drew his sword and met him in battle.Within the sea of flames, the two of them engaged in an intense battle. The thug\u2019s saber techniques were ferocious, and each strike was incredibly unrestrained, carrying immense power as his attacks rained down on Bai Qi. On the other hand, Bai Qi\u2019s sword techniques were graceful and nimble.Clang! Clang! Clang!Sparks flew as saber and sword continuously collided. By now, the thug\u2019s strikes started to become weaker, while Bai Qi still looked leisurely and at ease. In the end, the thug carelessly revealed an opening and had his heart pierced by Bai Qi, dying on the spot.\u201cYour leader has died! Surrender and your life will be spared!\u201d Bai Qi roared after killing the leader of the thugs.When they saw that their leader had died and that they had been surrounded by enemies with far greater numbers, the remaining bandits could only obediently put down their weapons and kneel on the ground to beg for their lives.At this moment, Zhao Fu saw a woman with red lips and devilish looks. Her figure was extremely mature and tempting, and she wore a red dress. She was currently brandishing a whip, making it so that the Infantry around her did not dare to approach her.Wang Ergou walked over with a pale expression and said to Zhao Fu, \u201cSir! That\u2019s the Third Mistress!\u201dZhao Fu stretched out his hand to an Archer beside him, who handed him an Iron Wood bow. He drew it and prepared to shoot a Rock Crushing Arrow. A mystical yellow aura appeared around the arrow, and Zhao Fu aimed it towards the seductive woman\u2019s chest.Just as he was about to release the arrow, the woman glanced over in his direction. When she saw the drawn arrow, her face paled. She was already surrounded and would die sooner or later, so she quickly threw her whip to the ground and yelled, \u201cI surrender!\u201dZhao Fu felt quite surprised and put away the bow and arrow. The fire was being greater and greater, so he ordered his people to bring out the captives while he hurried to the Wild Wolf Village Hall.Now that the Wild Wolf Village\u2019s lord was dead, it could be directly conquered. If the lord hadn\u2019t died, the City Heart would release energy to protect itself.Zhao Fu put his hand on the floating white cube and chose to [Relocate] the village.\u201cSystem Announcement! The Great Qin Village has obtained 345 EXP!\u201d\u201cSystem Announcement! You have gained 50 Achievement Points!\u201d\u201cSystem Announcement! Your status has been promoted to Citizen!\u201dZhao Fu ignored the system announcements and quickly ran out of the Wild Wolf Village. The entire Wild Wolf Village was engulfed by flames, and it soon turned into nothing.Now, Zhao Fu finally had some time to look at his new status. Before, he had only been a Commoner, and he required 200 Achievement Points to be promoted. Every conquered village gave him 50 Achievement Points, and now that he had conquered four villages, he had enough Achievement Points to be promoted.He now needed 500 Achievement Points to be promoted from Citizen to Esquire, which meant that he would be promoted after conquering ten villages.\u201cYour Majesty! We confiscated these from the bandits!\u201dBai Qi walked over with a sack of money, a piece of paper, and a large sabre, and handed them to Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu took the items and looked them over. The sack of money had about 30 or so silver coins. Zhao Fu did not care much about the money, but he was quite interested in the paper.[Little Spirit Pill \u2013 Pill Recipe]: White grade, Required Ingredients: Little Spirit Grass, Treebud Root, and Eternal Stone. Effects: Can increase cultivation speed by 200%.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu was quite delighted when he saw this pill recipe. Treebud Roots and Eternal Stones were quite common, but Little Spirit Grass was harder to find.Zhao Fu then looked at the large saber:[Mountain Sabre]: Grade: Blue, Stats: Strength +1, Description: An abnormally sharp saber that can crush rocks.Bai Qi used swords, so this saber was not suitable for him. As such, he stored it away until he wanted to use it to reward someone for his or her meritorious service.Zhao Fu then turned to look at the captives.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123There were 64 captives in total. There was only one woman, who was the Third Mistress. For any of these people to be able to survive in a bandit village, they definitely weren\u2019t righteous and moral people.Zhao Fu thought for a moment and said, \u201cWang Ergou, come over here. Tell me who has committed the most evils or was a leader in the Wild Wolf Village.\u201dWang Ergou shakily went over to Zhao Fu with a pale face. The Wild Wolf Village\u2019s people furiously glared at him because they knew that he was a traitor.However, even though they were furious, they did not dare to openly express it. After all, their lives were currently in Wang Ergou\u2019s hands. If he claimed that someone had been a leader or had committed great evils, he or she would definitely die. Wang Ergou also felt this heavy burden, and he did not dare to look into anyone\u2019s eyes.What surprised Zhao Fu was that Wang Ergou suddenly knelt to the ground and begged, \u201cSir! The First Master was the leader and committed the most evils, but he\u2019s been killed, and the Second Master was also poisoned to death. Please spare their lives; I\u2019ll even kowtow to you.\u201d After saying this, Wang Ergou heavily kowtowed a few times before raising his head and looking at Zhao Fu with a pleading expression.Zhao Fu fell deep into thought. He knew that the loyalty of these bandits would be an issue, so he had wanted to kill some of the leaders before handing them to Bai Qi to be properly disciplined and trained. Now that Wang Ergou was pleading for their lives, Zhao Fu turned to look at the Wild Wolf Village\u2019s people.Finally, he said, \u201cAre you willing to offer your loyalty to us?\u201dHearing this, a look of surprise and joy appeared on the bandits\u2019 faces, and they immediately half-knelt and said in unison, \u201cWe are willing to serve sir to the death!\u201dHowever, there was one person who did not kneel down, and the person instead stood there with a look of hesitation \u2013 it was the Third Mistress.The Third Mistress was quite beautiful, but Zhao Fu was not that interested in those sorts of things. Zhao Fu hadn\u2019t wanted to spare any of the leaders originally, and seeing this, he waved his hand, saying softly, \u201cKill her. Bai Qi, I\u2019ll leave the rest of these people to you. Make sure you train them well!\u201d After saying this, Zhao Fu prepared to take his people back to the Great Qin Village.A few soldiers immediately obeyed and went to grab the Third Mistress in order to behead her.Seeing this, the Third Mistress\u2019s face paled, and she hurriedly cried out, \u201cI\u2019m willing to submit to you, but you have to promise not to touch my body!\u201d\u201cEh? Who wants her body?\u201dZhao Fu stopped, a look of surprise on his face. However, he didn\u2019t want to explain anything \u2013 after all, for this woman to become the Third Mistress, she definitely wasn\u2019t ordinary. It was best to get rid of her, so he once again waved his hand, signaling for her to be killed.\u201cWait! I\u2019ll give you my first time, but you have to promise to leave me alone afterwards!\u201d The Third Mistress called out as she bit her lip and came to a decision.\u201cFirst time?\u201dZhao Fu was speechless. Did she really think that he was that sort of person? He once again waved his hand, signaling for her to be quickly killed.10 or so soldiers holding Iron Wood Sabers obeyed and surrounded the Third Mistress, preparing to slash her to death.The Wild Wolf Village\u2019s people quickly tried to persuade her, \u201cThird Mistress, it would be best if you submitted to sir. This sir has an extraordinary bearing, and he will accomplish great things in the future!\u201dHearing this, the Third Mistress clenched her fists and gritted her teeth as she once again called out, \u201cAlright! I\u2019ll agree to once per week at most, and I\u2019ll sign a Life-or-Death Contract with you.\u201d\u201cLife-or-Death Contract.\u201dZhao Fu had started to feel annoyed when he heard the Third Mistress speak again, but when he heard \u201cLife-or-Death Contract,\u201d he paused because he had no idea what that was.Following this, the Third Mistress took out a piece of paper and bit her thumb. She pressed her bloodied thumb to the paper before handing it to a soldier to give to Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu received it and looked at it:[Life-or-Death Contract]: Description: Links the lives of two people together. If the master dies, the other side will also immediately die.\u201cSystem announcement! Would you like to accept Liu Mei\u2019s Life-or-Death Contract?\u201dSo something like this existed in this world. Zhao Fu decided to prepare a few copies when he got back to prevent any betrayals. Zhao Fu thought for a few moments, and because he was not too worried about the Third Mistress, he chose to accept.The paper suddenly became motes of light and split into two halves: one half went into Zhao Fu\u2019s body, and the other half went into Liu Mei\u2019s body.Now that all of the people had surrendered, Zhao Fu could look at their grades. Most of them were F grade, and a few of them were C grade. What surprised Zhao Fu greatly was that Liu Mei was actually S grade, so he couldn\u2019t help but stare at her. Seeing this, Bai Qi fell into his own thoughts.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go back to the village!\u201d Zhao Fu ordered.When the Wild Wolf Village\u2019s people saw that the Third Mistress wasn\u2019t going to die, they let out a sigh of relief. Bai Qi looked around and looked like he seemed to understand something.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..After returning to the Great Qin Village, the Wild Wolf Village\u2019s people were incredibly shocked when they heard that the Great Qin Village was a Legendary grade Village, and they completely accepted their loss.When Li Si saw that Zhao Fu and Bai Qi had returned safely, he let out a sigh of relief.Zhao Fu said to Li Si, \u201cLi Si, I\u2019ll leave the arrangements of these people to you!\u201dLi Si looked at the Wolf Village\u2019s people and nodded his head. Bai Qi suddenly walked up and whispered something into Li Si\u2019s ears, causing a delighted look to appear on his face. Zhao Fu felt that this was quite strange, but he did not give it much mind. He took a few soldiers and went south of the Great Qin Village. Zhao Fu took out the white City Heart and pressed it against the ground.\u201cSystem announcement! Would you like to use the City Heart?\u201dZhao Fu replied \u2018yes,\u2019 and just like the Great Qin Village, waves of light rippled out as a few basic buildings slowly appeared.After walking into the Village Hall, Zhao Fu looked at the stats:Village Name: Wild Wolf Village (Normal)Level: Primary (0/5000)Village Area: 1 square kilometerVillage Territory: 5 square kilometersResidents: 0/300Military: 0/100Popular Support: 0Village Special Stats: Territory Crop Output +2%, Territory Crop Growing Time -2%.Subsidiary Village Limit: 0These were the stats of a Normal Village, and the difference between the Wild Wolf Village and the Great Qin Village\u2019s stats was like the difference between the heavens and the earth. Currently, the number of residents and Popular Support in Wild Wolf Village were both 0 because Zhao Fu brought the Wild Wolf Village\u2019s villagers under the Great Qin Village\u2019s name. Otherwise, the Wild Wolf Village\u2019s Popular Support would be in the negatives, and any new villagers there would be bandits.Currently, the Wild Wolf Village did not have a Tailor, Blacksmith, or Apothecary \u2013 they had most likely run away. However, there were three buildings that had Profession Change Stone Steles, and each of those three professions had a limit of one person.At the Barracks, there was only one Profession Change Stone Stele there:[Bandit]: F grade Military. Description: A scourge that appears when Popular Support goes into the negatives. Effect: Receives [Bandit Saber Technique]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu wanted to destroy the Bandit Profession Change Stone Stele and change it to [Militia], but after thinking about it, he realized that it might be useful in the future, so he chose to keep it for now.He found an elder in the Great Qin Village with management experience and made him the new Village Chief of the Wild Wolf Village. He also left behind a few soldiers to look after the Wild Wolf Village. From the next day onwards, normal villagers would start to be summoned.After dealing with these matters, Zhao Fu returned to the Great Qin Village and planned to discuss with Bai Qi and Li Si about the Li Family Village. However, after chatting for just a short while, Li Si gave Zhao Fu a deep look and said, \u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s getting late, and you\u2019ve really exerted yourself today. It would be best for you to get some rest.\u201dZhao Fu felt quite strange when he heard this, but he saw that it was indeed getting late. As such, he returned to his room, but right after opening the door, he was completely stunned. This was because there was a mature, alluring woman lying naked on his bed.Zhao Fu immediately turned around and closed the door, loudly yelling, \u201cLi Si! Get over here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On one hand, Your Majesty will have a concubine, and on the other hand, we\u2019ll be able to quickly gain the Wild Wolf Village\u2019s loyalty. This is perfect.\u201dZhao Fu bitterly laughed and asked, \u201cWhen did I become interested in her?\u201dLi Si looked at Zhao Fu strangely and said, \u201cBai Qi told me!\u201dUpon hearing this, Bai Qi\u2019s face paled, realizing that he had misunderstood Zhao Fu\u2019s intentions. He quickly started to apologize but was cut off by Zhao Fu. How could he blame them over such a small matter? As such, he said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s just leave it at this. It\u2019s getting late, so both of you should get some rest.\u201dLi Si and Bai Qi let out sighs of relief and asked to be excused before leaving.Zhao Fu turned to look at his room and shook his head before finding another room to cultivate in before falling asleep.When Liu Mei saw that Zhao Fu wasn\u2019t going to come in, she let out a sigh of relief before putting her clothes back on.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Early the next day, as darkness gradually receded and the world slowly became brighter, the blue sky could slowly be seen, and a few birds happily chirped in the trees.Zhao Fu woke up and walked out of his room, and he found Wang Ergou holding a washbowl outside his door. Just as Zhao Fu walked out, Wang Ergou said, trying to curry favor, \u201cYour Majesty, you\u2019re awake! This lowly one has brought you some water to wash your face.\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d Zhao Fu replied and took the towel in the washbowl to wipe his face.Wang Ergou said in a small voice for fear that Zhao Fu would get angry, \u201cYour Majesty, you still haven\u2019t given me the antidote yet.\u201dSo it was that. Zhao Fu laughed as he replied, \u201cThat medicinal pill wasn\u2019t poisonous!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Wang Ergou asked happily.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Zhao Fu replied. \u201cI\u2019ll let you have a taste after we actually create some poison.\u201dA bitter look appeared on Wang Ergou\u2019s face as he pleaded, \u201cYour Majesty, please, no! I\u2019ll be your servant every day; how about that?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see how you do!\u201d Zhao Fu said as he walked away. Wang Ergou quickly poured out the water from the washbowl and followed behind Zhao Fu.\u201cBai Qi! Gather a team and come with me to the Li Family Village!\u201d Zhao Fu looked at the new villagers. There were 14 of them and one of them was B grade. Zhao Fu did not arrange for them to change their profession to soldier, and he instead split them up and sent them to the Smithy, Tailor Shop, and Medicine Shop.As the Great Qin Village gained more and more people, their consumption also increased, so he needed to arrange for some people to help out in those shops.Following this, Bai Qi arrived with a team of soldiers. Zhao Fu had done this because he was afraid that Li Youcai might go back on his word, as they only had a verbal agreement. A person\u2019s heart could never be fully relied upon \u2013 one moment he or she might confidently promise something just to go back on it in the next moment. As such, Zhao Fu decided to leave himself a backup plan.\u201cYour Majesty, can you return my weapon to me?\u201d Liu Mei said after she found Zhao Fu and awkwardly saluted him.Zhao Fu nodded. Her whip was Blue grade, and it had been confiscated when she had surrendered. When Liu Mei saw that Zhao Fu agreed to give it back to her, a look of joy appeared on her face. She had expected that she would not be able to recover it.\u201cCome with us to the Li Family Village later,\u201d Zhao Fu said to Liu Mei before going over to Bai Qi.Liu Mei nodded and went to retrieve her whip.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..One hour later, Zhao Fu arrived at the Li Family Village. He told his soldiers to hide while he walked in with Bai Qi and Liu Mei.The Li Family Village knew that the Wild Wolf Village had been destroyed and reduced to rubble the previous night. When the Li Family Village found out, some were excited while others were fearful. Those who were excited were excited because the Wild Wolf Village, a poisonous blight that had plagued them, had been eliminated. Those who were fearful were fearful because they were afraid that Zhao Fu would make a move against them.The village gates opened and Li Youcai brought a group of people to welcome them, \u201cSir, you\u2019re truly a hero \u2013 you actually destroyed the Wild Wolf Village, saving the Li Family Village. Our entire village has agreed to join your village.\u201dLi Youcai was a sly old fellow. When he saw that even the Wild Wolf Village\u2019s Third Mistress had submitted to Zhao Fu, he knew that the remnants of the Wild Wolf Village had joined Zhao Fu\u2019s forces. If Zhao Fu could destroy the Wild Wolf Village and even gain the remnant bandits, the Li Family Village would not be able to resist him at all. As such, Li Youcai chose to surrender while continuously praising Zhao Fu, and he looked quite sincere and loyal.\u201cSystem announcement! The Li Family Village has surrendered to you. Would you like to accept?\u201dZhao Fu chose to accept and was awarded 60 Achievement Points, which made him feel quite surprised. He looked at the Li Family Village\u2019s stats and found that the Li Family Village was a Blue grade Village, which gave him 10 more Achievement Points than Normal grade Villages.However, Zhao Fu currently already had 4 Subsidiary Villages, so after thinking about it, Zhao Fu made the newly-rebuilt Wolf Village an Affiliated Village instead.Affiliated Villages were different from Subsidiary Villages: Affiliated Villages still belonged to the Great Qin Village, but they did not receive any stat bonuses from the Great Qin Village.Following this, Li Youcai invited Zhao Fu and his followers in to talk about the details of joining the Great Qin Village. As they walked through the village, many of the Li Family villagers looked at Liu Mei with curiosity. They had heard about her evil deeds, and it was said that she was a ferocious shrew. However, none of them expected her to be so pretty.Facing these stares, Liu Mei turned and glared at them savagely, saying, \u201cWhat are you staring at? If you keep staring, I\u2019ll rip your eyes out.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Li Family villagers were so scared by how ferocious she looked that they involuntarily took a step back.Zhao Fu turned to look at her and frowned, causing Liu Mei to lower her head. After much discussion, Zhao Fu took away two-thirds of the Li Family Village\u2019s people. Under Li Youcai and Li Wen\u2019s request, Li Wen also went with Zhao Fu to the Great Qin Village.Li Youcai did this because the Li Family Village had joined the Great Qin Village, and after hearing about the Great Qin Village, he felt that its future would be quite bright. As such, he wanted his son to join the Great Qin Village as soon as possible \u2013 who knows, he might be able to receive some benefits.After taking these people back to the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu went to look at the Great Qin Village\u2019s military. Zhao Fu now had more than 200 soldiers, and he left them in Bai Qi\u2019s care to be trained. Following this, Zhao Fu received a great piece of news: some villagers had discovered a small iron mine about five kilometers west of the Great Qin Village.Zhao Fu was delighted and sent some people to mine the iron. He also sent more people to work on the stairs at the massive crack. After all, there was a treasure trove at the bottom \u2013 killing a few Skeletons at the bottom would net them skills and items that were worth tens of gold coins, so Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but feel incredibly moved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123Two days later, the stairs were completed. Because it was not very wide at the bottom, Zhao Fu only brought 10 Shieldbearers, 10 Infantry, 10 Archers, Bai Qi, and Old Logue. They were currently walking down the stairs towards the bottom.By now, their equipment looked completely different. The Infantry were all using iron swords and sabers, while the shields that the Shieldbearers held had a thick layer of iron on the surface, increasing their defensive capabilities greatly. The arrowheads that the Archers now used were also iron, and everyone was wearing leather armor.The Great Qin Village was currently unable to create plate armor \u2013 there were many different kinds of plate armor, and they all required blueprints. Also, the price of creating plate armor was roughly eight times more expensive than creating normal weapons.Right now, Bai Qi was using a Blue grade sword \u2013 it was one of the weapons they had obtained last time from this place, and it had been made usable again after some simple repairs. The Blue grade armor he was wearing was from the Violent Fire Rabbit he had killed before.Zhao Fu stayed at the back \u2013 he was not one to rush at the enemy, so he only wore Normal grade leather armor because it would be more suitable for Bai Qi to have the Blue grade leather armor.Their group held torches, and the formation was as follows: Bai Qi and the Shieldbearers in the first row, Infantry in the second row, Archers in the third row, and then Zhao Fu and Old Logue, the Mages, in the fourth row.As they slowly advanced, tongues of blue flames appeared in the heads of five Skeletons ahead. They raised their weapons and rushed at the group of humans. These five Skeletons were all Infantry and held either swords, sabers, or spears.Bai Qi and the Shieldbearers created a defensive wall, blocking off the Skeleton soldiers. The Skeleton soldiers swung their weapons at the Shieldbearers, but they were blocked by the Shieldbearers\u2019 shields.The Archers drew their bows and fired arrows at the Skeleton soldiers. Arrows weren\u2019t very effective against Skeletons because unless the arrows hit the Skeletons\u2019 heads, the arrows would not deal much damage. However, the arrows could obstruct the Skeleton soldiers, giving the Infantry opportunities to attack.This time, Bai Qi and Old Logue didn\u2019t do much \u2013 the five Skeleton soldiers were split up by the Shieldbearers while the Archers made it difficult for them to attack, and the Infantry attacked the Skeleton soldiers, causing them to retreat. After the Skeleton soldiers lost their balance, the Infantry wildly attacked them without any worries.After doing this three or four times, the Skeleton soldiers became a pile of bones. Because Skeletons were fuelled by spirit power, once their spirit power ran dry, they would naturally \u2018die\u2019. The five Skeleton soldiers dropped three Refined Martial Souls and five weapons.After advancing, they encountered six Skeleton Infantry and two Skeleton Archers.The six Skeleton Infantry raised their weapons and rushed at Zhao Fu\u2019s group without any fear. The Skeleton Archers drew arrows from their quivers and drew their rusty bows.Swish! Swish!Two arrows tore through the air and drew an arc as they flew towards Zhao Fu\u2019s group of people.The Shieldbearers quickly raised their shields, blocking the two arrows. However, by now, the six Skeleton Infantry were right in front of them. If the Skeleton Archers continuously shot arrows, they would disrupt Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers\u2019 coordination. Moreover, if they weren\u2019t careful, they would be hit by the Skeleton Archers\u2019 arrows, causing injury or death.Zhao Fu immediately called out, \u201cOld Logue, attack!\u201dOld Logue obeyed and raised his wooden staff as two blood-colored fireballs flew at the Skeletons, blasting the six Skeleton Infantry backwards.Zhao Fu once again commanded, \u201cArchers, suppress those two Skeleton Archers!\u201dThe Archers drew their bows, sending arrow after arrow towards the Skeleton Archers, who were about to attack again.Following this, Zhao Fu ordered, \u201cBai Qi, rush over there and deal with those two Skeleton Archers.\u201dBai Qi ran around the six Skeleton Infantry that had been blasted backwards and charged towards the two Skeleton Archers.By now, the six Skeleton Infantry were slowly getting back to their feet, and Zhao Fu quickly yelled, \u201cShieldbearers! Separate them and attack them like last time!\u201dZhao Fu gave out a flurry of commands, and everyone quickly carried them out. The Shieldbearers and Infantry formed six small teams and separated the Skeleton Infantry while the 10 Archers fired at them whenever they found the opportunity to. Bai Qi rushed to the Skeleton Archers and swung down with his sword, which was covered in sword qi.Just like that, they stabilized the situation and turned it in their favor.Old Logue looked up and stared at Zhao Fu giving orders. Before, even when they were enemies, Old Logue felt quite fearful towards him because he felt that Zhao Fu was incredibly calm and rational when dealing with matters.Zhao Fu had quickly analyzed the situation and rapidly given out orders in a coherent and calm manner, twisting this situation in their favor. Old Logue felt that it was only natural for his village to submit to Zhao Fu, and his Loyalty towards Zhao Fu increased.Now that their allies and enemies were fighting at such close range, Zhao Fu and Old Logue could only stand by and watch.Bai Qi was the first to succeed. He lopped off one of the Skeleton Archers\u2019 heads and slashed his sword the other way, sending the other Skeleton Archer crashing against a wall, after which it fell apart.The Shieldbearers and Infantry also coordinated like they did last time, and they dealt with the Skeleton Infantry one by one.This time, they obtained 10 weapons: eight were Blue grade and two were White grade, and the two White grade weapons were the Archers\u2019 short swords. There were also five Refined Martial Souls.After resting for a short while, they continued ahead.It was completely dark within the passage, and the dark made it feel as if there was no end. It was also deathly silent, making everyone feel quite wary.At this moment, the sounds of the Skeletons coming to life could be heard. There were 12 Skeletons this time; 11 of them were Skeleton soldiers that held sabers, while the last one held a large saber and wore a suit of armor. The last Skeleton\u2019s displayed name was [Skeleton Captain].The situation instantly became quite dangerous for Zhao Fu and his soldiers.The Skeleton Captain drew its sword and roared as a formless soundwave rippled outwards, its voice incredibly ear-piercing.Following this, the Skeleton Captain rushed over with the other Skeleton soldiers behind it, and they did not seem clumsy or disorderly at all. They followed behind the Skeleton Captain as if they were living soldiers, and they gave off an unstoppable aura as they charged towards Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers.\u201cIs this the Skeleton Captain\u2019s effect?\u201d Zhao Fu muttered before yelling, \u201cArrange the formation!\u201dThe soldiers\u2019 expressions became grim as they started to move. The Shieldbearers formed a shield wall with the Infantry behind them, and the Archers prepared their arrows.\u201cFire!\u201dThe Archers obeyed, and arrows streaked through the air, reaching the Skeletons in an instant. The Skeleton Captain brandished its large saber, and a cold light glinted as five or six arrows were cut out of the air.At this moment, Zhao Fu roared, \u201cLogue!!\u201dOld Logue was fully prepared, and he raised his wooden staff, drawing out his full power. Two blood-colored fireballs appeared above his head, and they were twice the size of the ones before.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOld Logue waved his wooden staff, causing the two blood-colored fireballs to fly at the Skeletons.The Skeleton Captain did not seem to fear the two fireballs at all. The Skeleton Captain tilted its saber as rays of grey light extended out from the saber, and it was about to slash at the two fireballs.At this moment, Zhao Fu coldly harrumphed. He had long since drawn his Iron Wood bow, and the arrow knocked on it shined with a mystical yellow light as he released it.Whoosh!The arrow shot out like a bolt of lightning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123The arrow heavily slammed into the Skeleton Captain\u2019s chest, and it was buried in its armor. The Skeleton Captain lost its balance, causing it to stumble back a few steps.At this moment, the two large blood-colored fireballs slammed into him.As two massive explosions sounded out, the fireballs exploded into fiery light, creating massive shockwaves and sending the Skeleton soldiers and Skeleton Captain flying.Just as the Skeleton Captain started climbing up from the ground, a blood-colored fireball from Zhao Fu landed on its body.Bang!!An explosion rang out as the Skeleton Captain, who was trying to stand, was sent flying three or four meters.By now, the other Skeleton soldiers were standing up. After losing the leadership of the Skeleton Captain, they instinctively rushed over.\u201cArchers, fire your arrows and suppress them!\u201d Zhao Fu yelled.The Archers continuously shot their arrows in order to stall for Old Logue. Soon, two blood-colored fireballs once again formed in the air and landed amidst the Skeleton soldiers, sending them flying.Nearby, the Skeleton Captain slowly struggled to its feet when a normal Fireball landed on its body, blasting it back another three or four meters.Seeing that they had successfully separated the Skeleton Captain from the Skeleton soldiers, Zhao Fu immediately said, \u201cBai Qi, I\u2019ll leave the Skeleton Captain to you!\u201dBai Qi nodded and ran towards the Skeleton Captain.The remaining 11 Skeleton soldiers were held up by Zhao Fu and the others. Once three or four of them were gathered together, fireballs flew over, after which the Shieldbearers and Infantry wildly attacked the Skeleton soldiers while they were on the ground.Soon, Zhao Fu was able to control the situation on his side. On Bai Qi\u2019s side, because the Skeleton Captain had been weakened by Zhao Fu and Old Logue\u2019s attacks, it was much weaker than before and was at a constant disadvantage. However, it was still quite powerful. The Skeleton Captain gripped its saber with both hands, attacking Bai Qi fiercely with each attack. Cold saber light continuously glinted as it continuously attacked Bai Qi.Since his side was under control, Zhao Fu looked over at Bai Qi. Zhao Fu once again knocked an arrow on his bow and used Rock Crushing Arrow, causing strands of mystical yellow light to gather on the arrow.The Skeleton Captain was currently spinning as its saber slashed towards Bai Qi\u2019s waist.At this moment, the arrow smashed into the Skeleton Captain\u2019s waist, stopping its spin. Bai Qi grasped this opportunity, his sword radiating an incredibly sharp sword qi as it pierced into the Skeleton Captain\u2019s head. The blue tongue of fire in the Skeleton Captain\u2019s head gradually dwindled before it disappeared.The Skeleton Captain\u2019s body then collapsed, turning into a pile of bones. Bai Qi quickly turned around and came over to join the others, facing three Skeleton soldiers by himself.Under Zhao Fu\u2019s commands, his soldiers attacked with their full strength, and with Old Logue\u2019s fireballs, the 11 Skeleton soldiers were quickly destroyed.This battle lasted for half an hour, and everyone was completely exhausted. This was especially so for Zhao Fu and Old Logue, whose minds were extremely weary.Following this, they started to collect the spoils from the battle. The 11 Skeleton soldiers dropped 11 Blue grade weapons and 8 Refined Martial Souls. After going over to the Skeleton Captain\u2019s bones, Zhao Fu saw his large saber first:[Hundred Vanguard Sabre]: Grade: Silver, Stats: Strength +3, Constitution +3, Description: An exquisite Gold grade weapon that has become rusty due to the passage of time, becoming an ordinary Silver grade weapon.Zhao Fu was quite happy to find a Silver grade weapon, and he looked at the Skeleton Captain\u2019s armor:[Lapis Lazuli Armour]: Grade: Blue, Stats: Constitution +1, Description: A Gold grade armor that has become rusty after over 10,000 years, becoming a Blue grade armor.After obtaining this armor, Zhao Fu gave it to Bai Qi for now. The Lapis Lazuli Armor\u2019s defensive capabilities were definitely higher than that of Bai Qi\u2019s current armor, so Bai Qi could wear it for now before going back to the village and repairing it.As for the Blue grade armor that Bai Qi had taken off, Zhao Fu decided to put it on. Apart from those two pieces of equipment, the Skeleton Captain also dropped an orb that shined with a faint light. Within the orb, there seemed to be a soldier wearing armor and holding a large saber. Seeing this, Zhao Fu picked it up and looked at it.[Soldier Soul]: Description: A powerful soul left behind by a soldier that can be fused into a City Heart to become a guardian spirit. It can also be fused into a weapon to strengthen it. (Note: 100 Soldier Souls can fuse to form a General Armament, and a Lord with 24 General Armaments can use 1000 Soldier Souls to fuse into a King Armament.)Zhao Fu was pleasantly surprised and felt that the Soldier Soul was quite powerful. Because he didn\u2019t know what a General Armament or King Armament was, he could only put the orb away for now, curiosity bubbling within him.After resting and recovering their strength and spirit for a while, they continued onwards.They did not meet any more troublesome enemies, and after killing 12 Skeleton Infantry and 5 Skeleton Archers, they obtained 13 Refined Martial Souls.Zhao Fu had thought that they would be able to continue advancing easily like this, but the situation quickly changed due to the appearance of Skeleton Shieldbearers.Zhao Fu had only been able to get so far by relying on the fact that he had defensive soldiers, while his enemies did not. Now that the enemy also had defensive soldiers, the situation became quite grim for him.This time, Zhao Fu encountered five Skeleton Infantry, three Skeleton Archers, and five Skeleton Shieldbearers.This situation was much more difficult than when they had faced 10 or so pure-offensive Skeleton soldiers. Every time Zhao Fu\u2019s Archers shot arrows, they were blocked by the Skeleton Shieldbearers, and charging at them was not so easy either. Shieldbearers could only face off against Shieldbearers in a stalemate.The only ones who could make a difference were Zhao Fu and Old Logue with their explosive attacks.The Skeleton Soldiers were also in formation with the Skeleton Shieldbearers in front, the Skeleton Infantry hiding behind them, and the Skeleton Archers standing far behind them with arrows nocked on their bows.Right now, Zhao Fu had no choice but to use his numbers advantage to go head-to-head with the Skeletons.On Zhao Fu\u2019s side, the Shieldbearers were also at the front, the Infantry behind them, and the Archers with their bows drawn at the back.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe two sides clashed together. Zhao Fu\u2019s Archers\u2019 main role was to suppress the Skeleton Archers, as Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers were all flesh and blood \u2013 when hit, they would be injured or die, unlike the Undead.Right now, Zhao Fu could only vigilantly monitor the situation. He wanted to use Fireballs to attack the Skeleton Archers, but Magic-type attacks did not have a very long range, so he could only wait for an opportune moment.However, the situation was always in Zhao Fu\u2019s favor. There were always two of Zhao Fu\u2019s Shieldbearers facing off against one Skeleton Shieldbearer, trying to knock them out of the way.However, despite becoming Undead, the Skeleton Shieldbearers seemed to know that Shieldbearers could only remain effective by staying together. As such, no matter how Zhao Fu\u2019s Shieldbearers shoved at them, the Skeleton Shieldbearers still remained tightly bunched up together.The situation remained completely deadlocked, so Zhao Fu had no choice but to send Bai Qi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He unleashed a Qi Slash with his full strength, his sword erupting with light as a 3-meter long arc of light slashed out from it.BOOM!!Bai Qi\u2019s attack caused 3 Skeleton Shieldbearers and the Skeleton Infantry behind them to be sent flying, completely destroying their defense.Zhao Fu hurriedly roared, \u201cHurry! Separate them!\u201dThe Shieldbearers and Infantry immediately obeyed, splitting into two teams and separating the Skeletons that had fallen and the Skeletons that hadn\u2019t.Now that the Skeletons\u2019 defense had been broken, they immediately fell into chaos. Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers started to attack, but because of how close his own people and the Skeletons were, Zhao Fu could not use any Fireballs and could only shoot Rock Crushing Arrows.While a Skeleton Shieldbearer was distracted, Zhao Fu shot an arrow at it, piercing into its head.A \u2018crack\u2019 sounded out as the blue tongue of fire within the Skeleton Shieldbearer\u2019s head was extinguished. Its body collapsed as its bones and the shield it was holding fell to the ground.It was actually quite difficult to hit a Skeleton\u2019s head because arrows were quite easy to dodge. Zhao Fu had only succeeded this time because the Skeleton Shieldbearer had been distracted.However, he did not have time to celebrate when a scream sounded out.\u201cArghhh!\u201dAfter being hit by a few arrows, a Skeleton Archer went all-out, rapidly shooting arrows, one of which had pierced into one of the Infantryman\u2019s arm.\u201cDamnit!\u201d Zhao Fu inwardly cursed as he yelled out, \u201cArchers, suppress those Skeleton Archers! Bai Qi, be careful.\u201dBai Qi nodded and rushed towards the Skeleton Archers while they were being restrained by Zhao Fu\u2019s Archers.Zhao Fu took the injured Infantryman out of the battle. Luckily, Zhao Fu had used the Refined Martial Soul from before, giving him a skill that he immediately became proficient at. As such, he had a good grasp of archery. Even though the arrows he shot out did not instantly kill any Skeletons like before, they temporarily stopped the Skeleton soldiers\u2019 attacks, creating some opportunities for his soldiers.The Skeleton soldiers seemed to detect that the battle was becoming more and more unfavorable towards them, and they started to ferociously attack with wild abandon. In the end, Zhao Fu\u2019s side finally killed all of the Skeletons at the price of 3 of his people getting injured. Bai Qi also successfully dispatched the Skeleton Archers, obtaining a Soldier Soul from one of the Skeleton Archers.This time, the 13 Skeleton soldiers had dropped 9 Refined Martial Souls, 13 Blue grade weapons, and 3 White grade weapons.Altogether, they had obtained 1 Silver grade weapon, 55 Blue grade weapons, 10 White grade weapons, 38 Refined Martial Souls, and 2 Soldier Souls on this expedition. They were worth roughly 405 gold coins, which was 4,050,000 copper coins.Zhao Fu didn\u2019t know how much Soldier Souls were worth because he had never seen them on forums before. They seemed to be quite rare, and it was difficult for Zhao Fu to put a price on them, so he did not count their value into the total he had calculated.The gains they had received today both surprised and delighted Zhao Fu. However, when he looked at the four injured soldiers, he inwardly sighed. They would have to stop here and go back to rest and strategize. If they continued on, they would keep sustaining injuries or even suffer deaths.Zhao Fu walked over to the soldier who had the worst injury, the Infantryman who had been shot in the arm by an arrow, and asked in concern, \u201cAre you alright?\u201dThe Infantryman quickly nodded, showing that he was fine.Seeing this, Zhao Fu said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you remove the arrow.\u201dThe Infantryman said in a somewhat panicked manner, \u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019ll just go to Apothecary Zhang. How could I trouble Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cAlright, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Zhao Fu bitterly smiled. Since these soldiers respected him so much, he felt quite guilty when he saw them get injured.Zhao Fu tore the Infantryman\u2019s sleeve and cut the arrow shaft before pulling the arrow out in an instant. Blood started to pour out from the wound, and Zhao Fu quickly used Blood Healing. This was the first time he had used it, so he was not sure what the effects would be.As Zhao Fu placed his hand near the wound, a blood-colored light shined from his hand. The Infantryman\u2019s bleeding stopped, and the flesh mended itself at a rate that could be seen by the naked eye.Even though Blood Healing did not completely heal the wound, it was already half healed.The Infantryman was almost moved to the point of tears. He had never thought that the incredibly distinguished Majesty, who would become the ruler of Great Qin, would personally tend to his wound. Everyone who saw this felt even more loyal towards Zhao Fu.Following this, Zhao Fu brought everyone back to the surface. He told the injured soldiers to get medical treatment and then delivered the weapons to Blacksmith Wang Dawu to be repaired.Zhao Fu and Bai Qi went to a room to discuss their experiences of the battles today. They discussed the shortcomings of their tactics as well as the weaknesses of their enemies and came up with new battle tactics.After a while, someone came and reported that a bandit village had been discovered 10 kilometers south of the Great Qin Village. Hearing this, Zhao Fu and Bai Qi concluded their discussion and started assembling their soldiers.\u201cYour Majesty! I want to go too.\u201dLiu Mei was quite excited when she heard that there was a fight going to happen \u2013 evidently, she wasn\u2019t one for peace and ran over to find Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu looked at her and asked, \u201cCan you completely obey my orders?\u201dLiu Mei quickly nodded, expressing that she would follow all of his commands.Seeing this, Zhao Fu reminded her, \u201cIf you don\u2019t follow orders on the battlefield and make trouble, I\u2019ll definitely kill you!\u201dLiu Mei knew that Zhao Fu was someone who would stand by his words. However, she felt slightly displeased \u2013 after all, she was quite a beauty, so how could this fellow keep threatening to kill her.\u201cForget it, I won\u2019t bicker with him. I\u2019ve been so bored in the Great Qin Village over the past few days, so I have to go with them to attack this bandit village,\u201d Liu Mei thought to herself. She once again nodded, showing that she understood.Zhao Fu did not say much after that. With Liu Mei\u2019s skills, she would be a great help to them on the battlefield.Soon, the soldiers had been gathered and they set off. After traveling for a little more than an hour, they arrived at the bandit village.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis bandit village was next to a small creek, and it was not very big. Its defenses were also quite poor, and there were around 150 people in the village. What surprised Zhao Fu was that 30 or so of them were wearing plate armor. Since they had so many pieces of plate armor, they most likely had blueprints for plate armor, which made him feel ecstatic.Now, Zhao Fu had around 300 soldiers in his forces: 200 were soldiers from the Great Qin Village, 60 Goblins, and 40 Gnome Crossbowmen.With 300 soldiers, Zhao Fu would definitely win if he directly attacked the bandit village, since the bandit village only had 150 people. However, Zhao Fu\u2019s forces would still suffer injuries and casualties, and that wasn\u2019t Zhao Fu\u2019s style.As such, he had to seriously look for any weaknesses or use a method similar to what he had used against the Wolf Village. Even though it was quite shameless, it was quite effective.As Zhao Fu observed the village, he found that there was no cultivated land within the bandit village, which made sense \u2013 the bandits obtained all of their food by raiding other villages or hunting beasts. This village seemed to be the latter, so the situation was not as complicated anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As expected, four groups of around 10 people each soon departed from the village in different directions.When Zhao Fu saw this, he also split his forces into four groups. He led one team and followed after them. He hid in the tall grass as he looked at the bandits swaggering along while holding their sabers. He called Bai Qi over and told him his tactic.Bai Qi looked quite awkward, saying, \u201cYour Majesty, unfortunately\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can do it.\u201dHearing this, Zhao Fu turned to look at Liu Mei beside him.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Liu Mei immediately asked. When Liu Mei saw Zhao Fu looking at her, she couldn\u2019t help but tremble and have a bad feeling about it.After Zhao Fu gave Liu Mei a simple explanation, she looked quite cheerful. She brought along Bai Qi and three other people and openly walked towards the group of bandits.\u201cOi! Stop right there!\u201d Liu Mei called out in a loud voice as she and the other four walked up to the bandits.Hearing this voice, the bandits turned around and saw a beauty in a red dress with four other people. Seeing that the other side only had five people, while their side had 10 people, they did not need to feel scared at all. One of the bandits lewdly smiled as he said, \u201cWhat does this big beauty want from us? Do you want to play with these big brothers?\u201dLiu Mei enchantingly smiled, and in the next second, she brandished her whip and cracked it towards the 10 men. Bai Qi and the others also rushed up, and the battle finished in an instant. Bai Qi killed four people alone, the other three people killed one person each, and Liu Mei left three people alive.At this moment, Liu Mei lightly waved her whip and charmingly smiled as she said, \u201cWhat were you saying just then?\u201dThe three bandits immediately knelt to the ground and begged, \u201cFemale hero! We\u2019re in the wrong, so please spare us.\u201d\u201cArghhh!\u201dJust as the bandit finished speaking, her whip lashed his body, and Liu Mei said with displeasure, \u201cWho\u2019s a female hero? I\u2019m your granny!\u201dThe bandits immediately nodded and said, \u201cYes, granny, granny\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more like it! Who are you all?\u201d Liu Mei asked while smiling.The three bandits quickly started speaking and said, \u201cWe\u2019re from the Ferocious Tiger Village, and our leader is Wang Meng. There are also 200 or so brothers inside the village.\u201dThe three bandits mentioned the Ferocious Tiger Village, their leader, and their numbers in order to scare Liu Mei into releasing them.However, her whip once again lashed their bodies, causing them to cry out in pain. Bloody streaks appeared on the three men\u2019s bodies as Liu Mei coldly harrumphed and said, \u201cSo what about the Ferocious Tiger Village? That man, Wang Meng, sounds like quite a useless fellow!\u201dThe three bandits quickly nodded and agreed.Pa! Pa! Pa!Her whip once again landed on the three men\u2019s bodies. Liu Mei coldly harrumphed in displeasure as she said, \u201cWhat did you say? I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201dThe three bandits cried out in pain and quickly said in a loud voice, \u201cWang Meng\u2019s a coward, and he\u2019s completely useless.\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Liu Mei laughed, her large breasts rippling as she once again whipped the 3 bandits, and said, \u201cI still couldn\u2019t hear you!\u201dThe three bandits could only endure it and continue cursing Wang Meng.However, Liu Mei continued to laugh while whipping the three bandits.Zhao Fu, who was hiding by the side, found that Liu Mei might have some secret interests and hobbies. However, she was still complying with his orders, so he didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cAlright! You can piss off back to your village. Tell Wang Meng to come here and lick the bottom of this granny\u2019s shoes, or I\u2019ll cripple him.\u201d Liu Mei said happily. After whipping these bandits for a long time, she felt quite cheerful.When the three bloodied and bruised bandits heard that this female demon was going to spare them, they felt overjoyed. They quickly crawled away, and after they returned, they added their own words. They told Wang Meng that the woman wanted to skin Wang Meng, make him mate with a sow, and told him to crawl over there and lick the bottom of her shoes.Hearing this, Wang Meng was completely infuriated and his face became red. After being told that there were only 5 of them, he roared, \u201cBrothers, come with me!\u201dFollowing this, Wang Meng took 50 or so bandits, nearly half of the village\u2019s forces, to where Liu Mei had appeared.Soon, Wang Meng came to a sparse area and found Liu Mei, yelling, \u201cSo you\u2019re that bitch! You wanted your elder to lick your shoes? Today, your elder and his brothers will all take turns screwing you!\u201dLiu Mei did not get angry, and she instead calmly smiled \u2013 after all, there was not much point in saying anything to someone who was about to die.\u201cRelease the arrows!!\u201dAs the order sounded out, arrows rained down on Wang Meng\u2019s 50 or so bandits. They were completely unprepared, and many of them were instantly killed.Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers had long since killed the other 3 teams that had left the Ferocious Tiger Village and joined up with the others. Wang Meng\u2019s 50 or so bandits were facing 40 Gnome Crossbowmen and 60 Archers, and they had been completely unprepared. Without any shelter, how could they survive?After a few rounds of attacks, Wang Meng and the 50 or so bandits all died.At this moment, Zhao Fu and his soldiers, who had been hiding in the grass, appeared. He ordered them to clear the battlefield and went over to Wang Meng\u2019s corpse. After searching it, he found a small bag with tens of silver coins and Wang Meng\u2019s Blue grade large saber.Following this, they headed to the Ferocious Tiger Village. Liu Mei smiled as she followed behind Zhao Fu, and Zhao Fu turned around and looked at her, saying softly, \u201cYou did well this time!\u201dZhao Fu had wanted Bai Qi to provoke and curse at the bandits as badly as possible. However, Bai Qi was a General \u2013 how could he say such things? As such, Zhao Fu asked Liu Mei, a former bandit, to do this, and she had done it excellently.Liu Mei lightly harrumphed and said in a pleased manner, \u201cBut of course, this granny\u2019s not weak at all!\u201dZhao Fu laughed when he heard this, but he did not say anything. They arrived at the Ferocious Tiger Village, which now only had 40 or so people, and it no longer posed a threat to them.Zhao Fu motioned at Bai Qi, who walked up and loudly called out, \u201cYou all must have been notified that your leader and the others have died. If you surrender now, I promise that we won\u2019t kill you all.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing that there were 300 or so enemies outside, after thinking about it for a while, the bandits decided not to fight to the death, and they instead obediently surrendered.Zhao Fu found the Blacksmith who knew how to forge plate armor \u2013 it was a dark-skinned fellow called Deng Li.Following this, Zhao Fu went to the Village Hall and conquered it, awarding him 50 Achievement Points. Because this village was quite far away from the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu chose to [Relocate] it, granting the Great Qin Village 280 EXP.At this moment, a system announcement sounded out:\u201cCongratulations! The Great Qin Village has levelled up into an Intermediate Village!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123Zhao Fu was happy that the Great Qin Village had finally leveled up. After returning to the Great Qin Village, he brought Deng Li and 36 pieces of plate armor to Wang Dawu and asked him to do some repairs on the plate armor.Right now, the Smithy and Tailor Shop greatly lacked people. The weapons they had obtained from the bottom of the crack had still not been repaired, and now, there was also plate armor that needed to be repaired. As such, Zhao Fu had to add some more people to help them.Afterwards, Zhao Fu re-established the Ferocious Tiger Village west of the Great Qin Village and sent a few people to manage it. Finally, he went to the Great Qin Village\u2019s Village Hall and looked at its new stats:Village Name: Great Qin Village (Legendary)Level: Intermediate (24/30,000)Village Area: 5 square kilometers.Village Territory: 250 square kilometres.Residents: 465/6000Military: 216/2400Popular Support: 80Village Special Stats: Territory Crop Output +40%, Territory Crop Growing Time -40%, Population Limit +20%, Residents\u2019 stats can randomly +2, Soldiers\u2019 stats +2%, Population Attraction +30%, chances of attracting higher grade population +30%Subsidiary Village Limit: 8Subordinate Villages: Logue Village, Jean Village, Dorun Village, Li Family Village, Wild Wolf Village, Ferocious Tiger VillageIn terms of stats, Zhao Fu was not too surprised that the village\u2019s stats had increased by 10%. However, he was shocked to see that he could now have 8 Subsidiary Villages.However, the population of the village was always a problem: he only had 465 residents, while the limit was 6000. Apart from the Great Qin Village, even the other villages had not been filled up. This was especially so for the Wild Wolf Village and the Ferocious Tiger Village \u2013 altogether, Zhao Fu had sent less than 20 people to those villages.Before, the Li Family Village had been quite populated, but Zhao Fu took two-thirds of the population with him to the Great Qin Village, so the Li Family Village was also lacking people.This made Zhao Fu sigh. However, he couldn\u2019t expect to fill all of them in just a few days or even weeks: the development of villages took months, if not years, and they would only gradually become powerful over time. Right now, with all of the villages combined and the Great Qin Village\u2019s special stats, he could summon 40 villagers every day.As for the bottom of the large crack, Zhao Fu did not plan on exploring it for the time being. He decided that he would create two special teams to explore the bottom of the crack in the future.Right now, Zhao Fu wanted to create a Mage group. Magic skills were quite rare, but they were incredibly powerful. As such, Zhao Fu planned to take some soldiers to kill magic beasts. He also wanted to tame some large beasts, such as cows, pigs, and horses. Because of their lack of horses, Zhao Fu had not been able to create a Cavalry team.They could not do without Cavalry, the most powerful type of soldier in an era where cold weapons reigned supreme. Moreover, with horses, they wouldn\u2019t have to run to places themselves.Zhao Fu spent some money to obtain the Taming skill without changing professions and brought Bai Qi, Old Logue, 10 Spear and Shield soldiers, 10 Sabermen, and 10 Archers with him. Finally, after much pleading from Liu Mei, Zhao Fu could only agree to take her as well.The Great Qin Village was in the outer region of the Forest of Horrors, and the further one went into the forest, the more magic beasts there would be. As such, Zhao Fu took his soldiers and headed west.On their journey, the trees became larger and larger, and they seemed to pierce through the clouds. The lighting became quite dim, and the trees\u2019 appearances were all quite strange. They would occasionally see some wild rabbits run past and make some noise.Zhao Fu did not pay these things much mind, and he led his people onwards. Soon, he found a sow and 8 piglets looking for food.Wild boars were animals that lived by themselves when they became mature, and unlike other animals that were usually caught in large numbers, they were quite hard to catch. If they could find a Den, that would be ideal.Dens were like villages for animals, and they were places where wild animals would spawn. However, there were very few Dens, and they were protected by at least hundreds of wild beasts up to even tens of thousands.They were now quite far away from the Great Qin Village, so it was impossible for them to go back just to bring the sow and piglets back, so they ended up sparing them.Onwards!Zhao Fu suddenly stopped as he discovered 10 or so Azure Oxen beside a small creek. Their fur was a light azure color, and they had 2 horns that gave off a metallic luster.If they could capture these Azure Oxen, they could use them to plow the land as well as deliver iron ore, saving them a lot of manpower. As such, Zhao Fu immediately turned his attention to the herd of Azure Oxen.However, these large wild beasts were not easy to catch. If Zhao Fu and his people rushed up to the Azure Oxen and caused them to go wild and charge at Zhao Fu and his people, things could go badly. His 10 Shieldbearers definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to stop these 10 or so Azure Oxen.Moreover, he couldn\u2019t rely on Archers either. It would be fine to shoot a few arrows at them, but if the arrows hit their vitals, the Azure Oxen would immediately run away. How could someone chase after an ox that had been stimulated by pain? Moreover, if the other oxen became scared and rushed off, they would not be able to do anything about it either.Perhaps the Archers could aim at the Azure Oxen\u2019s legs, making it so that they couldn\u2019t run. However, there was a chance of permanently crippling the Azure Oxen. Using crippled Azure Oxen to plow the land or to deliver iron ore wouldn\u2019t be very efficient.As such, using traps was their best course of action. Zhao Fu turned and told his idea to Bai Qi and the others, and they all nodded in agreement and started to set traps north of the Azure Oxen.Zhao Fu split the soldiers into three teams, and Zhao Fu, Bai Qi, and Liu Mei took leadership of one team each. Because Old Logue was fairly old and was a Goblin, he couldn\u2019t run very fast, so he would stay where he was and use his fireballs to make sure that the Azure Oxen ran into the traps.Following this, they set their plan into action. Zhao Fu, Bai Qi, and Liu Mei\u2019s teams came from the east, south, and west, moving towards the Azure Oxen. As they drew closer, the Azure Oxen sensed danger, stopped eating grass, and started to look around them.At this moment, the three teams rushed at them but did not attack. They only loudly shouted or hit their swords and sabers against their shields, making it seem like they had a massive force. This caused the Azure Oxen to run away in fear.The most cheerful of them all was Liu Mei, and she laughed loudly as she brandished her whip. As the soldiers clamored and rushed at the Azure Oxen from the east, south, and west, the oxen could only run north.The three teams gradually joined together and chased after the Azure Oxen. If the Azure Oxen strayed off the path leading to the traps, Zhao Fu\u2019s Archers used their arrows to herd them in the right direction.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSoon, the Azure Oxen rushed into the traps and their legs were tightly bound.Bang, bang, bang, bang\u2026The Azure Oxen crashed to the ground, causing muffled sounds and dust to fill the air. The Azure Oxen quickly got up and tried to run, but they could not get rid of the ropes around their legs.These ropes were two finger widths thick, and they were wrapped around trees that were at least 1 meter thick. As such, no matter how much the Azure Oxen struggled, they could not break free.When they had used up all of their strength, Zhao Fu\u2019s people went up to them and started to use Taming, easily netting them 16 Azure Oxen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this moment, some rustling could be heard from the grass nearby, causing everyone to stop. A Violent Flame Rabbit jumped out \u2013 this Violet Flame Rabbit was smaller than the one they had encountered some time ago.Violent Flame Rabbits have extremely explosive temperaments, and it dared to attack Zhao Fu\u2019s massive group of people, a fireball flying towards them.A Shieldbearer raised his shield and stepped forwards, blocking the fireball easily. The force behind the fireball only caused him to take a single step back, and he barely took any damage at all.At this moment, Zhao Fu ordered his Archers to attack. Facing so many arrows, the Violent Flame Rabbit tried to dodge as quickly as it could, but it ended up just being shot to death. However, after the Violent Flame Rabbit died, it did not drop a red orb, making Zhao Fu feel quite disappointed.They continued forwards and encountered 30 or so Black Mountain Sheep. They used traps to once again capture and tame them, and this happened quite a few times over the next few days before they returned.In the end, they tamed quite a few wild beasts: 36 wild boars, 85 Azure Oxen, and 215 Black Mountain Sheep.They did not obtain a single Magic skill or find any horses. Over these few days, Wang Dawu had done a simple repair on all of the weapons they had obtained at the bottom of the crack and on the plate armor.After changing their equipment, out of the 30 people that Zhao Fu had brought with him, most of the Archers and Shieldbearers had Blue grade weapons, while almost every Infantryman had Blue grade weapons.After Wang Dawu completed these, Zhao Fu ordered him to create some special equipment. This equipment was designed by Zhao Fu, Bai Qi, and Li Si to deal specifically with the Skeletons.Zhao Fu continued taking people to the Forest of Horrors in hopes of encountering some magic beasts or horses.At this moment, Zhao Fu was passing by a mountain valley when a few Grey Wolves suddenly rushed at them. They were quickly killed by the Archers, but this piqued Zhao Fu\u2019s curiosity, so he decided to explore the valley.Who would have thought that he would find a Den within the valley? Zhao Fu and his soldiers hid on a mountain slope nearby, scoping out the area.Below them was the mountain valley, and there was a flat piece of land around 3,000 meters in length. There were wild grasses growing around it, but there was a round stage made of brick at the center, and it looked very much like the [Origin] of a village. However, there was a statue of a wolf floating above the round stage.There were many Grey Wolves around the round stage who were playing and fighting. There seemed to be around 400 to 500 of them, and there was even a Wolf King among them. It was as big as a tiger and had soft-looking grey fur. Its gaze was sharp, and the fur on its head was silver.Even though they had not discovered any magic beasts or horses, Zhao Fu was quite happy to have made such a discovery.Zhao Fu immediately returned to the Great Qin Village, gathered his forces, and headed back to the Grey Wolf valley with 326 soldiers.Of course, Zhao Fu did not launch a direct attack. Unless he held an overwhelming advantage, he would never do such a thing, so they first hid for a while. He then ordered his soldiers to start creating traps to lure the wolves out. It was quite simple: they would use fresh meat and blood to attract them. The traps didn\u2019t even have to be too close to the wolves because wolves have an excellent sense of smell. Luring over 10 or so wolves would be enough.Zhao Fu caught and killed a few wild deer, cutting up their corpses and pouring their blood on the ground to ensure the success of the traps. Those who were ordered to hide nearby rolled around in the mud for a while and used bits of chili and garlic to cover their scent.The plan went quite successfully. Soon, 10 or so Grey Wolves were attracted by the scent of blood and guts. The Grey Wolves were still quite alert and did not immediately leap onto the deer meat. Instead, they used their sense of smell from a distance, and after not discovering any danger, they slowly approached.Following this, the Grey Wolves went beside the deer meat but did not immediately start eating. They lowered their heads and smelled it \u2013 it would have been impossible for Zhao Fu to use poison \u2013 and after confirming that the deer meat was fine, they started to eat when\u2026Swish! Swish! Swish\u2026Arrows shot out of the forest towards the Grey Wolves. They were greatly startled and turned to run away, but many of them were still killed. A few of them were able to escape from the rain of arrows but were immediately cornered by Zhao Fu\u2019s hidden soldiers.At this moment, one of the Grey Wolves stopped and raised its head. Zhao Fu realised that it was about to howl to attract over other Grey Wolves \u2013 this would cause his plan to fail, so he quickly drew his bow and shot an arrow at it.The arrow drew an arc through the air, glinting with a cold light.Puchi!The arrow stabbed into the Grey Wolf\u2019s neck, causing it to fall to the ground and rasp quietly. After twitching a few times, it died on the spot. Zhao Fu gave the order for the other Grey Wolves to be quickly killed so that they wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to call the other wolves.Zhao Fu\u2019s people quickly acted, disposing of the remaining Grey Wolves. After this, they continuously used the same method to lure over Grey Wolves but became much more careful.In this way, they killed 213 Grey Wolves. After so many wolves died, the Grey Wolf King in the mountain valley detected something and stood up, walked to a large rock, and raised its head.\u201cAwoooo~~~\u201dA massive howl echoed throughout the valley, and the wolves that had been playing or eating all stopped what they were doing and howled in response.\u201cAwoooo! Awooo! Awooo\u2026\u201dWolves from all over the valley howled, giving off a fearsome aura and causing countless birds to fly away from the mountain valley.By now, Zhao Fu and his soldiers had returned to the valley and gotten into formation. They marched with heavy footsteps, giving off the airs of a grand army as they entered the valley.The Grey Wolf King on the large rock immediately saw Zhao Fu and his soldiers and furiously howled. The Grey Wolves started to rush at Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers without regard for their lives, and soon, 300 Grey Wolves were rushing at them like a grey flood.\u201cAssume positions!\u201d Zhao Fu loudly roared.The Spear and Shield Soldiers took three steps forwards, pointing their spears at the Grey Wolves. The Archers also drew their bows as the Gnomes readied their crossbows.\u201cFire!\u201d Zhao Fu loudly called out when the Grey Wolves entered their attack range.Swish! Swish! Swish\u2026The sound of the air being torn continuously sounded out as arrows and crossbow bolts streaked through the air, raining down on the Grey Wolves.Chi! Chi! Chi\u2026As the rain of arrows and crossbow bolts descended, the Grey Wolves fell one after another, but there were still ones that continued running.\u201cFire!\u201d Zhao Fu once again roared.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euArrows and crossbow bolts once again filled the sky, covering the pack of Grey Wolves and killing many of them.By now, the surviving Grey Wolves had reached Zhao Fu\u2019s forces, and they sprang towards them. However, the Shieldbearers at the front stabbed out with their spears.Chi! Chi! Chi\u2026Blood splattered everywhere as multiple Grey Wolves were pierced by the spears. Wolves were not very strong by themselves and were only powerful in packs. After going through two waves of arrows and crossbow bolts, there were only 150 or so Grey Wolves remaining from the 300 Grey Wolves. Even though there were still many of them, Zhao Fu\u2019s forces had double their numbers and were in perfect formation, creating an unbreakable wall. The battle was completely in Zhao Fu\u2019s favor.The Grey Wolf King could not watch on anymore, its body turning into a black blur as it rushed towards Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It ferociously snarled as it leaped towards the Shieldbearers.However, at this moment, 2 blood-colored fireballs flew towards it. Old Logue, who had done nothing this entire time, finally acted. The Grey Wolf King was quite surprised and twisted its body, narrowly avoiding the fireballs. Just as it landed on the ground, it was savagely hit by a whip \u2013 Liu Mei had also acted.Even though the whip didn\u2019t deal much damage to it, it still hurt quite a lot. After taking this hit, the Grey Wolf King turned and bared its fangs at Liu Mei, roaring as it rushed towards her.However, before it could take a few steps, a figure suddenly arrived by its side.Puchi!A sword light flashed and blood flew out as Bai Qi, who had been long-prepared, also attacked. The Grey Wolf King cried out in pain and turned its head, biting towards Bai Qi.Bai Qi was expecting this and quickly darted backwards.Puchi!An arrow pierced through one of the Grey Wolf King\u2019s front legs. Zhao Fu had an arrow nocked this entire time, and he had finally found an opportunity.The Grey Wolf King was completely enraged by this chain of attacks, and it roared as it sprang towards Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu didn\u2019t look afraid at all when he saw the Grey Wolf King coming towards him. Zhao Fu did not move, and he instead calmly raised a hand as he sent a fireball towards it. The Grey Wolf King twisted and dodged it, but 2 blood-colored fireballs shot at it right after. The Grey Wolf King barely dodged one but was hit by the other one.Bang!A massive explosion sounded out as the Grey Wolf King was blasted backwards, scorching its fur. Just as it landed on the ground again, Bai Qi appeared by its side and slashed the Grey Wolf King, adding another injury to the Grey Wolf King\u2019s body and causing it to madly rush at him.In the next instant, a whip tangled around its legs. Liu Mei gripped her whip with both hands, loudly laughing as the Grey Wolf King lost its balance and crashed to the ground.This was the effect of a group of people coordinating together perfectly. Because they outnumbered the Grey Wolf King, it was barely able to counterattack at all. Since they had the Grey Wolf King under control, Zhao Fu turned his attention to commanding his soldiers to eliminate the rest of the Grey Wolves.10 minutes later, all of the Grey Wolves had been killed, dropping countless copper coins. Only a few of the soldiers had been bitten, and their injuries were not too serious.Zhao Fu turned his attention back to the Grey Wolf King. By now, its body was riddled with injuries, and it looked extremely pitiful. Zhao Fu thought about it and decided not to kill the Grey Wolf King \u2013 the benefits of taming it far exceeded the benefits from killing it, so he ordered people to use ropes to tie it up.The Grey Wolf King no longer had any strength left, and with the cooperation of Bai Qi and the others, it was soon trussed up.Zhao Fu lightly smiled. As everyone else cleared the battlefield, he walked over to the Grey Wolf King and looked at it.The Grey Wolf King savagely glared at Zhao Fu, and it wanted to kill him and eat him in one gulp. However, Zhao Fu did not mind, and he placed his hand on the Grey Wolf King\u2019s head. Because its mouth was tightly bound as well, he didn\u2019t have to be afraid of being bitten.Zhao Fu tried using Taming, and a light came out from his hand, covering the Grey Wolf King\u2019s entire body. However, the Grey Wolf King struggled against it, causing it to fail.Zhao Fu\u2019s gaze became serious, and he pressed his hand down on the Grey Wolf King\u2019s head with even more strength and used Taming again. However, the Grey Wolf King desperately struggled, and it escaped from the light again. A system announcement told Zhao Fu that his Taming had failed, and he was even knocked to the ground because the Grey Wolf King started flailing.Seeing this, Bai Qi\u2019s eyes glinted as he walked over and said, \u201cYour Majesty, wolves are a very proud type of animal, and they are very difficult to tame. It would be better to just kill it!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I\u2019ve never eaten the meat of a Wolf King, and I really want to try it!\u201d Liu Mei said as she ran over and looked at the Grey Wolf King. As she became closer with the Great Qin Village\u2019s people, she gradually stopped being reserved, and she did not worry about Zhao Fu killing her anymore.Zhao Fu shook his head, refusing to take their advice. He decided to try again. When he came before the Grey Wolf King, he said calmly, \u201cYou must be furious because I killed your clan. However, in this world, the strong prey on the weak. If you submit to me, one day, I\u2019ll make you the most respected existence in the Wolf Clan, and your Den will soon return to what it was like before. If you don\u2019t agree, I\u2019ll just kill you and wait for the next Wolf King to appear. A conflicted look appeared in the Grey Wolf King\u2019s eyes before it chose to submit.\u201cSystem announcement! You have obtained the loyalty of a Chief class creature, the Grey Wolf King.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! You have obtained 50 Achievement Points for subduing a Chief class creature.\u201dZhao Fu was quite surprised and pleased to find out that he had received Achievement Points too. He used some basic healing on the Grey Wolf King, and Bai Qi and Old Logue continuously congratulated him. On the other hand, Liu Mei pouted unhappily because she would not be able to try Wolf King meat.Following this, Zhao Fu looked at the Grey Wolf King\u2019s stats.[Grey Wolf King] (Chief)Level: Stage 0-5Grade: SStats: Strength: 15, Intelligence: 9, Agility: 17, Constitution: 11Skills: Wolf King\u2019s Might (strikes fear into ordinary wolves and makes them submit), Bloodthirsty Bite (madly bites the enemy until the enemy is dead)Zhao Fu was quite surprised to find that beasts had grades as well. Given that its level was in Stages just like a person\u2019s cultivation, the Grey Wolf King was most likely not just a wild beast but also a magic beast.Zhao Fu left Bai Qi to clean up the battlefield, and Zhao Fu went to the Den and touched his hand to the statue of the wolf, receiving some information.[Den \u2013 Grey Wolf]: (Primary 1800/5000), Grade: White, Description: The Den of Grey Wolves, spawns 2-5 Grey Wolves per day.The Den\u2019s stats were quite similar to those of a Normal Village\u2019s. Zhao Fu chose to conquer it, and he received a system announcement notifying him that he had received 50 Achievement Points. This place was quite far from the Great Qin Village, so he chose to [Relocate] it. The Great Qin Village received 180 EXP, and the wolf-shaped statute shrank and fell into Zhao Fu\u2019s hand.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu was about to take the statue away and leave when he suddenly noticed large patches of jade-green, crystal-like grass. It looked quite extraordinary, and he couldn\u2019t help but take a closer look at it:[Little Spirit Grass]: Grade: Stage 1 Medicinal Grass, Description: A type of spirit grass that can be used to make medicinal pills. Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but smile when he saw this. Before, Zhao Fu had obtained the pill recipe for Little Spirit Pill, but he could not make any due to the lack of ingredients. However, he had never expected to find the ingredients so easily.There were thousands of blades of Little Spirit Grass here, and Zhao Fu immediately ordered his soldiers to start collecting them. He planned to use some to refine into pills, while the rest would be re-planted at the Great Qin Village. After all, the Great Qin Village reduced the amount of time it took to grow things, so Zhao Fu planned to plant Little Spirit Grass in mass amounts at the Great Qin Village.Finally, after this, everyone returned to the Great Qin Village. They had obtained great gains today, and everyone looked quite delighted.After returning to the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu separated a plot of land for the Den. Wolves have a very acute sense of smell, so they could be used for hunting. Moreover, the materials from their bodies could be used for creating equipment, and the Den would spawn new Grey Wolves every day, which meant that there would be no need to breed them. Zhao Fu felt that he hadn\u2019t left the Heaven Awaken World in quite some time, so after he checked the make sure there weren\u2019t any pressing matters that needed to be attended to, he exited to the real world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He ate his instant noodles while looking through the Heaven Awaken World forum to see if there was anything new or interesting.It turned out that there were indeed some new additions to the Heaven Awaken World forum. There was now a \u2018Hero Rankings.\u2019Currently, there were not any actual rankings in the Hero Rankings; right now, it was just a collection of descendants of the major heroes in history.There were figures like the descendant of the Three Kingdom\u2019s L\u00fc Bu, L\u00fc Zhan, who could take on 10 bandits with his halberd; the descendant of the Tang Dynasty\u2019s Cheng Yaojin, Cheng Daman, who wielded his massive hatchet with great prowess; and the descendant of the Song Dynasty\u2019s Bao Qingtian, Bao Xiaoduan, who had godly deduction skills.After these people entered the Heaven Awaken World, they received legacies and the professions of famed generals and officials. However, it was not clear if they were willing to serve the empires that their ancestors served. They were all great talents and most likely thought highly of themselves; how could they not want to establish themselves in the Heaven Awaken World?There was also some news that Zhuge Gui, the descendant of Zhuge Liang from the Three Kingdoms, had boldly stated that he would not serve his ancestor\u2019s master because he wanted to prove himself to be greater than his ancestor. There was also the descendant of the Ming Dynasty\u2019s Li Shanchang, Li Jun, who had sworn to face against Great Ming\u2026Apart from these, what also interested Zhao Fu was that some of the ancient Schools of Thought had started to make a comeback.There were the Legalists, who used law to rule a country, the School of the Military, which specialised in war tactics, the Taoists, who followed the rhythm of the natural world and the Dao, the Confucianists, who sought to enlighten the world, the School of Yin Yang, which synthesised the concepts of yin yang and the five elements, the Logicians, who were skilled in debating, the Mohists, who advocated pacifism and defence, the Agriculturalists, who believed that people should live off the land, and the School of Miscellany, which tried to integrate the merits of various schools, such as Confucianists, Mohists, Legalists, while avoiding their perceived flaws\u2026There truly were a \u2018Hundred Schools of Thought\u2019 all battling for supremacy. The Heaven Awaken World was becoming more and more interesting, and Zhao Fu lightly laughed before his expression became grim.\u201cThe common people live in suffering, and flames of war fill the world.The schools of thought number one hundred, but only I travel vertically and horizontally unhindered.The sky contains the stars and the moon, and the earth contains the Ghost Valley.One vertical and one horizontal, unable to be comprehended for hundreds of years.\u201d\u201cThe School of Vertical and Horizontal!\u201d Zhao Fu looked at this School seriously. He had to take this School seriously because it was much too dangerous.The Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn period and the Seven Powerful States during the Warring States period \u2013 behind each of their rises and falls was a single name: The Ghost Valley\u2019s School of Vertical and Horizontal.Pang Juan joined the state of Wei, and his bravery and martial might surpassed everyone else\u2019s. He was an invincible force that gained victories over Han, Zhao, Chu, and Qi, causing the once-weak state of Wei to sweep away everything in the world and to dominate the central plains. Sun Bin joined the state of Qi, and with his matchless intellect, he reduced Zhao, Wei, Han, and Chu\u2019s might, causing the state of Qi to once again gain dominance. After he died, his books on military strategy were passed on for countless generations.Afterwards, strategist Su Qin advocated the \u2018Vertical Alliance\u2019 system, rallying the six states to ally against Qin, while Zhang Yi advocated the \u2018Horizontal Alliance\u2019 system, which supported alliances with the state of Qin to destroy the six states. The two people saw the entire world as a chess board and the countless lives as chess pieces.Even though this School had very few people, it commanded both the respect and fear of all people. People respected the School of Vertical and Horizontal because gaining the loyalty of someone from the School of Vertical and Horizontal would be even greater than obtaining millions of experts. They were terrifying because they had the power to destroy an entire nation.Zhao Fu paid some mind to this School, and he felt a strange sense of heaviness in his heart. In the end, he could only sigh and continue reading.After this, the biggest matter pertained to the Ying family. The Ying family was looking for anyone with their family\u2019s bloodline and claimed that they would treat him or her generously. The Ying Family also asked the person who obtained their ancestor\u2019s legacy to quickly go to their main branch \u2013 no matter if it was wealth, power, or beauty, the Ying family would satisfy that person completely, and it would allow that person to become the inheritor of the next generation of the Ying family.Zhao Fu thought about it for a moment, but because he didn\u2019t want to join the Ying family, he didn\u2019t give much thought to the matter.However, this matter caught the attention of all of the other powerful families. In terms of strength and foundation, Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, and Han were the 5 most powerful overlords. After Han, China descended into chaos, and no dynasty could rival those first 5.In this world, who didn\u2019t have ambition or want to conquer the world? Normal families could only look up to the families with the legacies of kingdoms and nations, while those families could only look up to families with the legacies of empires with their own dynasties. Those who had the legacies of empires could only look up to those 5 families.This was truly a new warring states period, and after finishing his instant noodles, Zhao Fu drank the noodle soup and entered the Heaven Awaken World.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..After entering the Heaven Awaken World, Li Si walked over to Zhao Fu, gave him a bottle of medicinal pills, and said that they were the Little Spirit Pills that they had successfully refined. Zhao Fu took off the cap and a fragrant and refreshing aroma came out from the bottle.Zhao Fu nodded and returned to his room to try out the effects. He took one of the medicinal pills, which was a faint red color and about the size of a soybean, and consumed it before starting to cultivate.A few hours later, a look of joy appeared on Zhao Fu\u2019s face \u2013 his cultivation had risen.Name: Zhao FuTitle: NoneProfession: Demon PriestAchievement Points: Citizen (213/500)Race: HumanAge: 21 (100)Stats: Strength: 9, Intelligence: 12, Constitution: 8, Agility: 10Special Power: [Weak \u2013 Demon\u2019s Power]Cultivation: Stage 0-2Cultivation Technique: Great Qin MantraSkills: Hell Fireball, Basic Sword Technique\u2026Equipment: Iron Sword\u2026The Little Spirit Pill greatly increased his cultivation speed. After trying out its effects himself, Zhao Fu immediately ordered some people to carefully grow the Little Spirit Grass. Following this, he took his forces into the Forest of Horrors again to look for horses this time.This time, Zhao Fu specifically brought the Grey Wolf King. Its wounds had not fully healed, but Zhao Fu was not going to make it fight. Rather, he wanted to use its keen sense of smell to find other beasts. At the same time, he changed its name to Little Grey. [TLN: Little Grey in Chinese would be \u2018Xiao Hui\u2019]After bringing Little Grey with him, they encountered wild beasts much faster than before. This time, they found 3 Violet Flame Rabbits, one of which dropped an elemental orb, and Zhao Fu planned to give the elemental orb to Li Wen. Li Wen was one of the Great Qin Village\u2019s rare A grade villagers and was also Li Youcai\u2019s son, so Zhao Fu decided to start developing him.In the next two days, they killed a few Wind Foxes, obtained a Wind Blade elemental orb, and tamed a few wild beasts. However, they did not find a single horse before returning.The special equipment he had asked Wang Dawu to make had been completed, so Zhao Fu decided to continue exploring the bottom of the crack.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI want to go too!\u201d Liu Mei ran over and said as she looked at Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu turned to look at he and said, \u201cYour whip won\u2019t be able to deal much damage to the Skeletons; just stay up here!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have a Wind Blade elemental orb? Let me learn it and see how strong those Skeletons are!\u201d Liu Mei said discourteously without any respect at all. Zhao Fu glared at her when he heard this.Deep down, Liu Mei still feared Zhao Fu greatly, and she instantly became docile, awkwardly saluting him as she said sadly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty.\u201dOnly then did Zhao Fu give her the Wind Blade skill, causing Liu Mei to be quite surprised and overjoyed. She immediately used the azure orb of light, and following this, Zhao Fu brought Bai Qi, Li Wen, Old Logue, Liu Mei, 10 Goblin Warriors, the 10 strongest Infantrymen, and 10 Archers into the passage at the bottom of the large crack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123As Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers walked along the dark passageway, they soon encountered a group of Skeletons. There were 11 of them, and 5 of them were Skeleton Shieldbearers and 6 of them were Skeleton Infantry. After coming to life, they quickly ran at Zhao Fu\u2019s forces.At this moment, the 10 Goblin Warriors, who were wearing plate armor and holding shields that were 2 meters tall, 1.2 meters wide, and 10 centimeters thick, stepped forwards, forming a shield wall. Because the passageway was only 10 meters wide while the shield wall would be 12 meters long, one of the Goblin Warriors stepped back. However, the shield wall was able to completely stop the Skeleton soldiers.No matter how the Skeleton Shieldbearers pushed and shoved, the Goblin Warriors were like immovable mountains.Zhao Fu felt quite pleased when he saw this. He then ordered for a gap to be opened to allow some Skeleton soldiers in.The 2 Goblin Warriors in the center obeyed, slightly shifting their shields. At that moment, a few of the Skeletons pushed, expecting to meet resistance, but they then fell through the gap. Quickly, the gap was closed off again.What they faced were 10 big men wearing plate armor and holding large iron hammers.When the iron hammers descended, the Skeleton was knocked to the ground, and after a few strikes, it was reduced to a pile of bones. Compared to sharp sabers and swords, blunt weapons were more effective against Skeletons, and Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers quickly used this method to kill the rest of the Skeletons.From this group of Skeletons, they had obtained 11 Blue grade weapons and 9 Refined Martial Souls, 3 of which were useful for Shieldbearers. As such, Zhao Fu immediately gave them to the Goblin Warriors.This was Zhao Fu\u2019s special plan: he had equipped Goblin Warriors with large shields and large-sized plate armor. Now that the Goblin Warriors had learned Shieldbearer skills, with their immense strength, they would be excellent Shieldbearers.Everyone in the team, no matter if it was the Goblin Warriors, Infantry, or Archers, had been given a Refined Martial Soul at some point.Before, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t want to use the Refined Martial Souls. After all, they were all quite special, and most of them could unlock skills that were C- grade or above. As such, he had thought that it would be a waste to give them to people who were E grade or F grade.However, he realized that he would have to make some sacrifices to obtain even more equipment and Refined Martial Souls.Three of the Goblin Warriors now had the C- grade skill Enhanced Shieldbearing, the 10 Infantrymen had the C grade skill Enhanced Impact, and the Archers all had the Rock Crushing Arrow skill that Zhao Fu had.Li Wen and Liu Mei had also used Refined Martial Souls. Li Wen used an Archer Refined Martial Soul and Liu Mei used an Infantry Refined Martial Soul, so after receiving their skills, they were immediately proficient at using them.Because Old Logue was quite old, he could not engage in close-range battles. Therefore, Old Logue did not use a Refined Martial Soul.It was clear right now that Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers were quite powerful, and they could destroy Skeletons effortlessly. They now advanced two times faster than before because they could suppress the Skeletons much easier now. The Goblin Warriors formed an impenetrable iron wall, and the 10 Infantrymen used their iron hammers to smash the Skeletons, which was much more effective than cutting or slashing them.Onwards!Blue tongues of fire lit up in the darkness, and 17 Skeletons came to life. 6 of them were Skeleton Shieldbearers, 6 of them were Skeleton Infantrymen, and 5 of them were Skeleton Archers.Facing so many Skeletons, Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers did not look afraid at all. They continued to advance in an orderly manner, and the Archers pierced the heads of 3 of the Skeleton Infantrymen in the first wave of arrows. The Goblin Warriors raised their shields and used the same method as before to deal with the Skeletons.The equipment and items dropped were the same as always, but Zhao Fu was ecstatic to find that there was also a Soldier Soul. The drop rate for Soldier Souls was quite low, and only Skeleton Captains seemed to have a 100% chance of dropping one.The next wave of Skeletons consisted of a Skeleton Captain and 10 or so Skeleton soldiers, and they charged towards Zhao Fu. This time, the Skeleton Captain was a Skeleton Archer who had incredibly proficient archery skills, and quite a few of Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers were almost injured.However, the Skeleton Captain was quickly killed by Bai Qi and the others, and it dropped a Soldier Soul and its Silver grade bow.[Flowing Cloud Bow]: Grade: Silver, Stats: Strength +3, Constitution +1, Agility +2, Description: An exquisite Gold grade weapon that has become rusty due to the passage of time, becoming an ordinary Silver grade weapon.Zhao Fu kept the Flowing Cloud Bow for now because he used his bow often. After advancing, they killed another three waves of Skeletons and obtained three Soldier Souls. The passage seemed to go on forever, and it was completely dark in front of them, making it impossible for them to see what was ahead.Clip clop clip clop clip clop clip clop\u2026The sound of horse hooves seemed to come from ahead. Zhao Fu thought of something, and it seemed that everyone else had as well.As expected, Skeleton Cavalry soon appeared in front of everyone. These Skeleton Cavalrymen were riding on Skeleton horses, and it seemed that they had kept their horses and equipment after they had died. While their equipment seemed to be White grade, their weapons seemed to be Blue grade.When the 5 Skeleton Cavalrymen appeared, they drew their long swords and brandished them as they rushed towards Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers.Zhao Fu immediately called out, \u201cShields!\u201dThe Goblin Warriors raised their massive shields with both hands, forming an iron wall. They braced themselves for impact as Zhao Fu also ordered the Archers to attack.Arrows started to fly through the air, and most of them were dodged by the Skeleton Cavalrymen. A few of them hit the Skeleton Cavalrymen, but they did not deal much damage. At most, the arrows could cause the Skeleton Cavalrymen to pause, but the arrows did not slow them down at all because they were riding on Skeleton horses.When the Skeleton Cavalrymen were right in front of Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers, 4 Fireballs and 1 Wind Blade shot towards them.Bang, bang, bang, bang\u2026A chain of explosions sounded out, and as these skills all exploded together, the front two Skeleton Cavalrymen were blasted off their horses, but the 3 Skeleton Cavalrymen beside and behind them were not affected much and continued onwards with the same momentum and ferocious aura.However, they were unable to do anything to the Goblin Warriors\u2019 shield wall, nor could they jump over it. After being hoisted up by the Goblin Warriors, the 2-meter-tall shields reached up to 2.3 meters high, a height that couldn\u2019t be scaled by normal horses.The Skeleton Cavalrymen could only spur their horses onwards to break through the shield wall.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBang! Bang! Bang!Three heavy sounds sounded out as the Skeleton horses slammed into the massive shields. The Goblin Warriors gritted their teeth and pushed forwards, stopping the charge of the horses.Zhao Fu ordered the Archers to kill the 2 Skeleton Cavalrymen that had fallen off their horses before telling the Goblin Warriors to open a gap to bring in 2 Skeleton Cavalrymen.Just as the 2 Skeleton Cavalrymen rushed in, the 10 Infantrymen split into 2 groups, raising their iron hammers and slamming them towards the Skeleton horses\u2019 legs, bringing them to the ground.Following this, the Infantrymen gathered around the Skeleton Cavalry and repeatedly slammed their hammers down on them, smashing them to bits before surrounding the final Skeleton Cavalryman.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123The 5 Skeleton Cavalrymen were all killed. Two of the Skeleton horses were killed, one was half-crippled, and the remaining two were trapped outside of the shield wall.The remaining two Skeleton horses were the horses of the 2 Skeleton Cavalrymen that had been blasted off their horses. They were no longer being controlled but still charged at the shield wall due to their natural instincts as Undead.Zhao Fu did not pay much attention to the 2 Skeleton horses for now. He went over to the half-crippled Skeleton horse and tried to use Taming on it to see if Skeleton horses could be tamed. If he could, he would use the Skeleton horses as warhorses, allowing him to start creating Cavalry.However, Zhao Fu found that Taming did not work on Undead, which disappointed him greatly. As such, he could only kill the Skeleton horses.Onwards!Zhao Fu continued onwards and killed a few more waves of Skeletons. Even though the Skeleton groups now had every major type of military unit, they could not threaten Zhao Fu\u2019s forces. The Skeletons were all killed, and they dropped many pieces of equipment, some Refined Martial Souls, and, on rare occasions, Soldier Souls.After proceeding for a while, the passage started to widen and they could see some changes. Zhao Fu let out a breath \u2013 it seemed that there was an end to this passage.Suddenly, a blue tongue of fire lit up as a powerful aura swept towards them. Everyone quickly raised their torches and saw a Skeleton General wearing silver armor and holding a double-handed sword coming to life.Everyone became completely serious.The Skeleton General slowly stood up and stared at Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers with the sockets in its head. It gave off an eerie killing intent, causing a chill to spread through the entire passage.Zhao Fu immediately called out, \u201cEveryone, be careful!\u201dAfter standing up, the Skeleton General started to walk towards Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers. Zhao Fu immediately ordered the Archers to attack.Swish, swish, swish\u2026The arrows flew through the air towards the Skeleton General. The Skeleton General continued walking forwards without even a trace of fear, and its sword was completely level. When the arrows were about 1 meter away from its body, it raised the sword in its hands, and a grey aura erupted from the sword. The Skeleton General casually waved the sword\u2026Bang!The arrows were all repelled by an invisible force, and none of them were able to even come close to its body.Zhao Fu drew the Flowing Cloud Bow and used Rock Crushing Arrow. A mystical yellow aura appeared around his arrow, and the arrow shot towards the Skeleton General. However, the Skeleton General merely tilted its head, causing the arrow to narrowly miss. The arrow stabbed into the ground behind the Skeleton General, and the arrow trembled from the force.After easily dodging Zhao Fu\u2019s arrow, the Skeleton General\u2019s figure suddenly flashed as it appeared before the shield wall, and it quickly raised its sword before slashing at the shieldwall.Clang!The sword hit the massive shields, causing an ear-piercing sound and creating many sparks. The five Goblin Warriors were sent stumbling back 4 or 5 meters, and a deep cut appeared on their shields.Zhao Fu and Bai Qi\u2019s expressions became grim when they saw just how powerful the Skeleton General was. Li Wen had never seen such a powerful Skeleton before, and his face became incredibly pale. Following this, Zhao Fu could only loudly call out:\u201cFire!\u201dArrows continuously shot towards the Skeleton General, but the Skeleton General\u2019s body turned into a blur, easily dodging all of the arrows and appearing elsewhere.Zhao Fu immediately yelled, \u201cWind Blade!\u201dLiu Mei didn\u2019t dare to be careless, and she put all of her focus into using Wind Blade, causing an azure crescent to shoot towards the Skeleton General.The Skeleton General pivoted, and the Wind Blade flew past the Skeleton General without damaging it at all.Following this, Zhao Fu called out, \u201cFireball!\u201dLi Wen silently bit his tongue, forcing himself to remain calm. This was the first time Zhao Fu had taken him out to fight, and he had also given him a precious elemental orb and a Refined Martial Soul. Since Zhao Fu treated him so well, how could he let him down?After joining the Great Qin Village, Li Wen told himself that he could not allow himself to become an ordinary villager; in the future, he wanted to be a famed general for Great Qin.When Li Wen first saw the Skeleton General, his face had been extremely pale. However, he had quickly calmed down and immediately released a fireball upon hearing the order.The fireball flew towards the Skeleton General from the front, and it appeared just as the Skeleton General had pivoted to dodge the Wind Blade, making it difficult for the Skeleton General to dodge the fireball. However, the Skeleton General was not worried at all, and it slashed the fireball.Bang!The fireball exploded, turning into tiny sparks.However, two blood-colored fireballs immediately came from its left and right, landing on the Skeleton General\u2019s body. Zhao Fu and Old Logue had acted together while the Skeleton General had been distracted by Li Wen.Bang!A massive explosion sounded out as the two blood-colored fireballs simultaneously exploded, but the blast did not send the Skeleton General flying. It was only forced back a few steps and only looked slightly worse for wear.\u201cFire!\u201d Zhao Fu ordered as the Archers raised their bows, once again shooting arrows at the Skeleton General. However, the Skeleton General once again easily deflected them with its sword.Chi!Zhao Fu found an opening and landed an arrow on the Skeleton General\u2019s abdomen. The arrow pierced through its armor, hitting the Skeleton General\u2019s lumbar vertebrae and causing it to take a slight step back.The Skeleton General looked towards Zhao Fu ominously and released a cold killing intent. Suddenly, its body turned into a black blur as it rushed towards Zhao Fu.Clang!A figure charged over from Zhao Fu\u2019s side, blocking the Skeleton General. When the two swords clashed together, sparks flew into the air. The figure was Bai Qi, and he had been preparing this entire time.The Skeleton General roared and pressed down on Bai Qi with its sword. Bai Qi\u2019s expression remained calm \u2013 his current strength was below that of the Skeleton General\u2019s, but he would not show any weakness. He gritted his teeth and used all of his strength to push back at the Skeleton General.\u201cRetreat!\u201d Zhao Fu ordered. Bai Qi quickly retreated without hesitation \u2013 he was completely obedient to Zhao Fu\u2019s orders. As soon as Bai Qi retreated, the 10 Goblin Warriors raised their shields and surrounded the Skeleton General.The Skeleton General paused in surprise, and it immediately swung its sword to escape from the encirclement.At this moment, four fireballs and one Wind Blade landed on the Skeleton General \u2013 Zhao Fu, Li Wen, Old Logue, and Liu Mei had simultaneously acted.Bang!The magic skills exploded together, and Old Logue and Zhao Fu\u2019s blood-colored fireballs were the most destructive. Even the Goblin Warriors surrounding the Skeleton General were all forced back by 1 step by the explosion.The Skeleton General in the center took quite a lot of damage, and it was in quite a pitiful state as it knelt on one knee on the ground. It stabbed its sword into the ground, preparing to stand up.The Goblin Warriors suddenly created a gap in the encirclement as arrows flew towards the Skeleton General.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cRoar!!!!!\u201dAfter being hit continuously, the Skeleton General loudly roared, vigorously slashing everything around it with its sword. The sword lightly hummed as 8 rays of grey sword qi slashed out.Boom!!!!A massive explosion sounded out. The 8 rays of sword qi tore through the air, forming a storm of sword qi. Not only had the arrows been stopped, but three of the Goblin Warriors were also sent flying, and many of their shields had 7 centimeter deep cuts.After using its ultimate skill, the Skeleton General looked exhausted, not moving from its position. At this moment, an arrow pierced into the Skeleton General\u2019s head, passing through it cleanly. The blue tongue of fire within the Skeleton General\u2019s head flickered before being extinguished, and the Skeleton General collapsed into a pile of bones. Only then did Zhao Fu put down his bow, a cold look in his eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Fu slowly walked over and picked up its double-handed sword. Normal Skeletons already had good items, so what would the Skeleton General\u2019s weapon be like?[Star Slashing Sword]: Grade: Gold, Stats: Strength +8, Constitution +4, Agility +2, Description: A Half-Legendary grade weapon that has become rusty due to the passage of time, becoming an ordinary Gold grade weapon.Zhao Fu was not let down \u2013 it was actually a Gold grade weapon. Zhao Fu handed the Star Slashing Sword to Bai Qi.Not only did a hint of joy appear on Bai Qi\u2019s cold and handsome face, but he also cupped his hands respectfully as he said, \u201cThank you, Your Majesty!\u201dZhao Fu nodded and looked over at the Skeleton General\u2019s armor.[White Soldier Armor]: Grade: Silver, Stats: Strength +2, Constitution +4, Description: An exquisite Gold grade armor that has become rusty due to the passage of time, becoming an ordinary Silver grade armor.Zhao Fu decided to give the armor to Bai Qi as well. Now that Bai Qi had suddenly received 2 pieces of powerful equipment, his stats were given a big boost, increasing his strength. After all, each time one increased a Step in cultivation, all of their stats would only increase by one, while the Star Slashing Sword gave the user 8 points of Strength.Zhao Fu continued looking through the items. There was something that looked like a Soldier Soul, and it seemed to have the figure of a General within it.[General Soul]: Description: A powerful soul left behind by a general that can be fused into a City Heart, becoming a guardian spirit. It can also be fused into a weapon to strengthen it (Note: 10 General Souls can fuse into a General Armament).It seemed that a single General Soul was worth 10 Soldier Souls \u2013 not bad! Zhao Fu felt quite happy because he was one big step closer to obtaining a General Armament. Who knew what sort of effects a General Armament would have?The fourth item was a grey-white, smooth, rectangular stone.[Skeleton General \u2013 Profession Change Stone]: Description: Allows a soldier to change his or her profession to Skeleton General. Can be used by living people but will have side-effects.Zhao Fu felt quite uneasy about this. Normally, one would only be able to change profession to General after his or her Village became a Town. Normal grade Towns could only have one General, Blue grade Towns could have two Generals, and Legendary grade Towns could have five Generals.[General]: C- grade Military. Description: A General that can lead soldiers. Effect: Can hold 2 different military professions.A General was a C- grade Military unit because he or she could choose 2 military professions and receive the stat bonuses of both professions. There were no limits on the professions, so one could choose two F grade professions or even two SSS grade professions.As such, a General profession was quite valuable. However, the Skeleton General Profession Change Stone had side-effects, and it might even change the one who used it into a Skeleton.Zhao Fu considered changing his profession to Skeleton General because he did not care about his looks. Even if he became a Skeleton, he would get used to it. However, when Zhao Fu tried to use it, he was notified by a system announcement that Lords could not change their profession to General.In the end, Zhao Fu told Bai Qi and the others about the Profession Change Stone. Bai Qi was already a General, so Zhao Fu looked to Liu Mei \u2013 she was S grade and had good potential.Facing Zhao Fu\u2019s gaze, Liu Mei looked incredibly unwilling. However, if Zhao Fu ordered her to use it, she would not be able to refuse. As such, Liu Mei thought for a moment before going over to Zhao Fu, hugging his arm, and rubbing her large chest against him as she said coyly, \u201cYour Majesty! Look how pretty I am; you can use me as a bed-warmer.\u201dLiu Mei knew that Zhao Fu was not very interested in her and would not lay his hands on her, so she was able to act so daringly.When everyone saw her acting so coyly, everybody felt a disgusted chill \u2013 every single one of them knew how ferocious and savage she was deep down.Zhao Fu threw away the idea of getting Liu Mei to use the Profession Change Stone. It wasn\u2019t because he was moved by her actions but because he didn\u2019t want to force his subordinates to do things that they didn\u2019t want to do.Just as Zhao Fu was about to put the Profession Change Stone away, Li Wen, who had been in deep thought this entire time, suddenly said, \u201cYour Majesty! Let me use it.\u201dZhao Fu looked over in surprise and reminded him, \u201cThere will be side-effects, and you might even turn into a Skeleton.\u201dLi Wen had a serious look as he earnestly nodded and replied, \u201cI know, Your Majesty, but this subordinate\u2019s grade is limited and cannot compare to General Bai Qi\u2019s. In the future, I might not be able to help Your Majesty much, so I want to use the Profession Change Stone.\u201dWhen Zhao Fu saw how sincere Li Wen looked, he sighed and handed the Profession Change Stone to Li Wen.Li Wen took the Profession Change Stone and chose to use it. A grey aura came out from the Profession Change Stone and swept towards Li Wen\u2019s body. Li Wen\u2019s entire body was enwrapped by the grey aura, but the grey aura disappeared after a while.There were some obvious changes to Li Wen\u2019s body: he was much skinnier than before, and his skin lost its rosy glow, making him look incredibly pale. His pupils also became a grey-white color. Apart from those, however, there was not much change. After recovering for a few moments, he respectfully saluted Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu let out a sigh of relief \u2013 it seemed that the side-effects were not too great. He nodded and looked at Li Wen\u2019s stats.Name: Li WenGrade: ATitle: NoneProfession: Skeleton GeneralAchievement Points: Commoner (0/200)Race: Human (Half Undead)Age: 22 (100)Loyalty: 90Stats: Strength: 9, Intelligence: 7, Constitution: 8, Agility: 6Special Power: [Weak \u2013 Undead\u2019s Power]Cultivation: Stage 0-1Cultivation Technique: Great Qin MantraSkills: Fireball, Basic Sword Technique, Rock Crushing Arrow\u2026Equipment: Plate Armor, Iron Sword\u2026There were 2 changes to Li Wen\u2019s stats: the first was his race, which was now Half Undead, and the second was that he gained the Undead\u2019s Power.The Undead\u2019s Power was like Zhao Fu\u2019s Demon\u2019s Power, and it belonged to non-human powers. After Zhao Fu obtained the Demon\u2019s Power, not only did he receive stat increases, but the normal Fireballs he cast also had traces of blood-color in them and were more powerful than normal Fireballs.Following this, Zhao Fu looked at the last item that the Skeleton General had dropped. It was a bronze command medallion with traces of rust on it, and it had an icy feel to it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[Command Seal \u2013 Undead]: Description: A command seal that has been contaminated by Undead aura for a long period of time. Allows one to command 10 normal Skeleton soldiers, and the Skeleton soldiers can be stored within the command seal.A smile appeared on Zhao Fu\u2019s face. Even though it could only allow him to command 10 normal Skeletons, that was already quite good. As such, Zhao Fu decided to use it on some Skeleton Cavalry.After looking at the Goblin Warriors\u2019 shields, he decided that they could continue for a bit longer. They would go back after conquering 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen.Onwards!The passage gradually became wider, and tongues of blue fire lit up ahead of them. This time, there were 14 Skeletons, and 4 of them were Skeleton Cavalrymen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123The 4 Skeleton Cavalrymen rushed over on their tall Skeleton horses, and they were followed by Skeleton Infantry, who gave off a ferocious aura.Even though there were so many Skeletons rushing at him, Zhao Fu\u2019s expression did not change in the slightest. When he raised the bronze command seal, four grey lights shot into the four Skeleton Cavalrymen\u2019s heads. The Skeleton Cavalrymen stopped as the blue tongue of fire in their heads suddenly flickered before they turned and started to attack the other Skeletons.The other Skeletons seemed to be quite confused \u2013 why did the Skeletons, who had been their allies just seconds ago, suddenly turn into their enemies? Very soon, Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers dealt with all of the remaining Skeleton soldiers.After continuing onwards, they encountered another three waves of Skeleton soldiers, and Zhao Fu was able to bring 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen under his command. He had been preparing to return when he suddenly saw a trace of light ahead, which seemed quite piercing in the dark passage.Zhao Fu could not suppress his curiosity, and he led his people onwards. The passage gradually became brighter and brighter, and it came to the point that the light became quite blinding. Everyone shielded his or her eyes as they continued. At the end of the passage, they arrived in a massive space.The space seemed to be 1,000 meters high and have an area of 30 square kilometers. What was terrifying was that the 30 square kilometer area seemed to be completely covered with bones, forming a sea of bones. There were all sorts of bones from a countless number of different tribes: Humans, Elves, Angels, Orcs, Demons\u2026There were bones from countless races here, and there was even a dragon skeleton that seemed to be around 1,000 meters long. It was not a western-dragon that had wings but a lizard-like dragon like those seen in the east. However, it was a dragon that could fly without wings. It had antlers like a deer and scales like a fish.\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Everyone looked around in shock and felt incredibly stunned and curious.At this moment, Zhao Fu saw a massive altar that seemed to be 300 meters tall and 10 kilometers wide. Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but start walking towards it.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Bai Qi called out to Zhao Fu with a serious expression.Zhao Fu nodded when he heard Bai Qi. He knew that this place was not simple, but he still wanted to have a look. He was not worried that the bones here would become Undead \u2013 if they could, the Forest of Horrors wouldn\u2019t even exist anymore because it would have been destroyed by the Undead.Zhao Fu stepped into the space, and the white bones beneath his feet cracked. He walked forwards as everyone looked around warily and slowly followed behind him.Finally, everyone reached the bottom of the altar without any mishaps.At this moment, they all finally saw the true appearance of the altar. The altar seemed to be made of a jade-like rock, and it was a light azure color. There seemed to be mystical runes flowing within each jade brick, and the entire altar gave off a mysterious and ancient aura.Zhao Fu stepped onto the jade stairs of the altar. When nothing happened, Zhao Fu was able to confirm that it wasn\u2019t a legacy altar, and everyone else followed behind him. Soon, they were at the top of the altar.There was a massive magic formation at the top of the altar, and there were also many jade channels around it. There were crystal-like energy stones in the jade channels, and there seemed to be over 1,000 in total.Zhao Fu knew that these energy stones contained massive amounts of energy, and they currently cost around 20 gold coins each. The energy in most of these energy stones had already been used up, and there were perhaps only 100 or so that had any energy remaining within them.Zhao Fu pressed his hand against the altar and received some information about it.[Heaven and Earth Refining Formation]: Description: One of the Six Great Heaven-Defying Magic Formations. It can refine anything and extract its source energy.Zhao Fu was completely dumbfounded when he saw this information. The Six Great Heaven-Defying Magic Formations \u2013 just this name alone told him how mighty this formation was. It could refine anything and extract its source energy, and Zhao Fu immediately looked over at the bones in this space. He thought of something but was not completely certain of its feasibility.Zhao Fu then looked around from the top of the altar. He found that there wasn\u2019t just one passage leading to this space; rather, there seemed to be over 1,000 passages that were the same as the one Zhao Fu had come through.Zhao Fu said with a serious expression, \u201cWe\u2019ll stop here for today; let\u2019s go back. Don\u2019t tell anyone about what we\u2019ve seen here.\u201dThey knew how important this matter was by how serious Zhao Fu looked, so they all nodded and replied, \u201cYes!\u201dFollowing this, they all returned aboveground.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Just as they returned, Li Si walked over with a look of joy on his face.Zhao Fu felt a bit surprised and asked, \u201cWhat is it, Li Si?\u201dLi Si cupped his hands respectfully and replied, \u201cYour Majesty, a group of Outlanders has come to pledge their loyalty.\u201dZhao Fu was quite confused when he heard this. Why would Outlanders take the initiative to pledge their loyalty? Zhao Fu went with Li Si to a vacant area in the village and saw 30 or so people there. They were about 1.3 meters tall, and their skin was slightly grey. They had powerful-looking limbs and looked a lot like humans \u2013 they were the lowest caste of Dwarves, Grey Dwarves.There were 20 or so males and 10 or so females. There were a few children, but there were no elderly Grey Dwarves. They all looked quite downcast and seemed to have traveled a long way. Their clothes were covered with mud and grass, and many of them seemed to be injured.When the Grey Dwarves saw Li Si bring a young man over, they understood that the young man was the Lord here, and a middle-aged Grey Dwarf walked over and said, \u201cGuha Doloka!\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! Solon has surrendered to you. Would you like to accept?\u201dZhao Fu couldn\u2019t understand the Dwarven language at all, so he immediately accepted the system announcement.Solon was the middle-aged Grey Dwarf, and after Zhao Fu accepted, a look of delight appeared on his face. He knelt on one knee, and the other Grey Dwarves did the same. They said, \u201cWe thank the esteemed Lord for accepting us!\u201d\u201cYou can all rise!\u201d Zhao Fu said, and the Grey Dwarves all got up.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSolon, what happened to all of you? Why are you all like this?\u201d When Zhao Fu saw their pitiful appearance, he couldn\u2019t help but ask them about it.Solon replied with a furious and sorrowful expression, \u201cLord, we were the villagers of Kaki Village, which is about 100 kilometers away from here. We numbered around 600, but we were attacked by a village of 5,000 or so Orcs. Most of us died, and we were the only ones able to escape!\u201d\u201cOrcs?\u201dZhao Fu felt quite surprised. Orcs were an incredibly aggressive race, and they were incredibly strong. They were quite violent, and normal Humans would find it impossible to win against an Orc one on one. What\u2019s more, there were 5,000 Orcs in that village \u2013 this was especially dangerous.However, Zhao Fu was not too worried because the Orc Village was 100 kilometers away, so the Orcs would not discover the Great Qin Village anytime soon. However, he could not simply hope that the Orcs would not find them. As such, Zhao Fu took Bai Qi and the others to discuss the Orcs while Li Si started to make arrangements for the new Grey Dwarves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After discussing with Bai Qi and the others, Zhao Fu decided that it would be best to avoid them for now. As such, he decided not to explore northwards temporarily to avoid encountering the Orcs. At the same time, he also ordered everyone in the village to strengthen defenses and to be careful.The Dwarf race naturally knew how to forge and was gifted at forging. Even though they were Grey Dwarves, they had Forging skills, and their help greatly relieved the burden on Wang Dawu. Now, Zhao Fu would be able to mass-produce equipment.Zhao Fu first arranged for the 10 Goblin Warriors\u2019 shields to be repaired, after which he took out the command seal and released the 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen. This caused quite a few cries of shock and fear, but Zhao Fu quickly explained that the Skeleton Cavalry was part of the village. Zhao Fu planned to make a new set of armor for the Skeleton Cavalry to increase their defense. Skeleton Cavalry was already quite powerful, and if the Skeleton Cavalrymen Fu had a set of complete armor, even Zhao Fu would not be able to kill them easily.At this moment, one of the villagers apart of the scouting team reported, \u201cYour Majesty! We\u2019ve discovered a Goblin Village 12 kilometers west from here!\u201dZhao Fu wanted to test out the idea he had at the bottom of the crack. As such, he took 300 soldiers and headed west of the Great Qin Village. The Goblin Village was like Logue Village, and there were around 300 Goblins. Out of the 300 Goblins, 200 of them were able to fight. The defenses around the village were quite weak as well.By now, the sun was starting to set, which was when the Goblins were returning from hunting. Zhao Fu immediately split his soldiers into 4 teams and set an ambush for the Goblins. They killed all 4 teams, causing the Goblin Village to lose 160 of its villagers.The Goblin villagers hadn\u2019t detected any danger yet. It was getting dark, and they were currently waiting for the hunting teams to bring back food.However, they were disappointed \u2013 not only did no Goblins return, but fire arrows also started to shoot into the village, killing many Goblins and setting many of their buildings on fire.After a while, the Goblins finally realized that it was an enemy attack, and they gathered their forces and rushed out of the village.When Zhao Fu saw that there were less than 100 Goblins rushing at them, he summoned 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen and took the rest of his soldiers to meet the attack.The Skeleton Cavalry spurred their Skeleton horses forth.The Skeleton horses galloped towards the Goblins, and after the Goblins saw how terrifying the 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen looked, they became completely scared. However, they mustered up all of their courage and continued charging for their village.Chi! Chi! Chi\u2026The Skeleton Soldiers stabbed the Goblins and pierced through their chests chests, causing blood to spray into the air.The 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen were like a sharp blade that stabbed into the Goblin forces. They rushed through the entire group, completely unstoppable, and split the Goblins into two groups \u2013 this was the might of Cavalry.Following this, Zhao Fu\u2019s Shieldbearers and Infantry rushed up and started to fight at close quarters with the Goblins. The Goblins had no chance at all \u2013 they had been completely outnumbered from the beginning and been scared witless by the Skeleton Cavalry, greatly reducing their morale.Zhao Fu decided that it was enough and told Old Logue to convince the Goblins to surrender. Unsurprisingly, the Goblin Village chose to surrender.By now, there were only 80 or so Goblins remaining. Most of them were elderly, pregnant females, or children, and there were only 10 or so of them that could fight. They had no choice but to surrender.Zhao Fu looked over at the 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen. After the battle had concluded, they stayed beside the Goblins\u2019 corpses, and streams of grey aura flowed out from the corpses into the Skeleton Cavalrymen. Following this, the soul fire within the Skeleton Cavalrymen\u2019s heads became stronger.\u201cThey can evolve through killing?\u201d Zhao Fu muttered to himself in surprise.Zhao Fu didn\u2019t mind this \u2013 after all, being able to evolve through killing was quite convenient for him. Afterwards, he went to the Village Hall to conquer the village and [Relocate] it. He received a system announcement that told him him that he had obtained 50 Achievement Points and that the Great Qin Village had obtained 201 EXP. Following this, he brought a few of the Goblin corpses back to the Great Qin Village.Zhao Fu then took some people to the altar where the bones were to test out his idea. He put one of the Goblin corpses within the formation before activating it.When the formation was activated, light shot out from it as a formless energy lifted the Goblin corpse into the air. The Goblin\u2019s blood and flesh seemed to melt, but they did not fall onto the altar. Instead, they flew towards its head.Following this, the Goblin corpse became a skeleton as a blood-red orb of light floated at the center of its forehead. The magic formation stopped, and the skeleton landed on the ground as the blood-colored orb of light floated in the air.Zhao Fu walked up and looked at its information. Even with his personality, he could help but laugh out loud, \u201cLet\u2019s see who can stop the rise of the Great Qin Empire.\u201d[F Grade Orb]: Description: A soul\u2019s source energy taken from a living or once-living being. After using the orb, one\u2019s grade can be upgraded to F grade.Even though he knew that the magic formation was for refining corpses, Zhao Fu had never thought that such an orb of light would be produced \u2013 it could actually change a person\u2019s grade.Of course, it didn\u2019t matter that the orb was only F grade. If he could obtain high grade corpses of S, SS, or SSS grade beings, the orbs of light refined from them would be able to greatly improve his people\u2019s grades.Right now, Cultivation did not matter too much. However, the future would be decided by soldiers with high Cultivation Stages, and the higher the grade of his soldiers, the faster they would be able to cultivate.\u201cWhat is it, Your Majesty?\u201d Bai Qi asked curiously. He almost never saw Zhao Fu act like this, and this was strange for him.Zhao Fu handed him the Grade Orb, and after looking at it, Bai Qi said in shock, \u201cThere are such heaven-defying things in the world?\u201dZhao Fu nodded. After thinking back to the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation\u2019s description, which said that it was one of the Six Great Heaven-Defying Magic Formations, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what the other 5 were.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYour Majesty, obtaining such a heaven-defying formation is Great Qin\u2019s great fortune!\u201d Thinking about Great Qin\u2019s future, Bai Qi congratulated Zhao Fu as he cupped his hands.\u201cAlright,\u201d Zhao Fu said, \u201cright now, this place is our most important place, so we should take steps to protect it.\u201dAfterwards, Bai Qi took 400 people to block each of the other passages.Zhao Fu did not know where those other passages led to or what could come out of them, so he could only block them for now before slowly exploring each one.That was the main job for the next few days. After arranging all of this, Zhao Fu came out of the Heaven Awaken World and read on the forum that the whole world was starting to descend into chaos. Nations, beliefs, and races started to violently clash together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Above was the Tsarist Empire, who glared at China like a tiger watching its prey, and below were various forces from Vietnam. To China\u2019s left were as many as 23 Indian nations and empires, and to its right was Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla\u2019s provocations. There was also Oda Nobunaga\u2019s descendant, Oda Kamiya from Japan.The Ancient Roman Empire had also been revived, and the Holy See started to create an army of Crusaders for religious purposes. In the west, it was said that King Arthur Pendragon\u2019s descendant, Tina Pendragon, had already obtained Excalibur.At the same time, the descendants of the ancient Pharaohs had also started to rise in power, and there were also many barbaric tribes starting to develop.The entire Heaven Awaken World seemed to descend into chaos, and less and less restraint was being shown. Because nations, faiths, and cultures were different, various factions started to wage war on each other. The most intense fighting was in cities that bordered counties, and blood started to dye the earth red in those places. Of course, the most chaotic place was China.China had always been the overlord of the east, and it had offended many nations over the course of history. It had been spied on by countless people, and its land shared borders with many other countries, making conflict inevitable.Zhao Fu read a few threads, and most of them were about how Chinese people living near the borders had been humiliated in various ways. Many people in the real world created threads mocking how powerless China was, making tensions in the real world quite high as well.This completely infuriated many of China\u2019s Legatees. The state of Zhao\u2019s Legatee, Zhao Yang, was situated near a border. He gathered all of the Chinese people in the area and slaughtered 10 enemy villages, gaining a lot of reputation and fame.That was the situation at the borders: either one faction would attack or the other one would. The land was filled with killing and darkness, and before anything had officially started, the world had descended into chaos.If it was already like this now, what would it be like in the future?Zhao Fu returned to the Heaven Awaken World and used a few days to block off all the other passages at the bone-filled space. However, he left a few open to start exploring them. At the same time, Zhao Fu ordered his soldiers to continue patrolling the area around the Great Qin Village. If they could find any villages, Zhao Fu would absorb them to increase the number of people he had.This was something that he had to do: the threat of the 5,000 Orcs was simply too great, and if they were unlucky enough to be discovered, they would not stand a chance.Zhao Fu went to the Research Workshop. He had not heard anything about the teleportation channels yet, so he planned to put that on pause to ask his Scholars to start researching skills that could allow him to see the grades of corpses. Lords could only look at the grades of their subordinates, so such a skill was incredibly important to him now that he had the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation.Just as he entered the Research Workshop, Bai Shan came up to him with a look of delight as he reported, \u201cYour Majesty! We\u2019ve successfully researched teleportation channels!\u201dThis was quite a pleasant surprise to Zhao Fu. Following this, he immediately ordered some people to build a teleportation channel in the Great Qin Village.What they built was a Primary Teleportation Channel, and it could only transport 2-3 people each time. In order to create more advanced teleportation channels, the Scholars would have to do more research, and since this teleportation channel was sufficient, Zhao Fu asked the Scholars to start researching skills that would allow him to see the grades of corpses.Now that they had teleportation channels, Zhao Fu changed his mind and decided to go have a look at a main city. After the teleportation channel was completed, it could connect to a main city\u2019s teleportation channel and take him there directly.Zhao Fu called Bai Qi over and brought along the 236 silver coins they had accumulated and a few Blue grade weapons. He took the Blue grade weapons to make sure that he would be able to buy what he wanted.Zhao Fu and Bai Qi stood on the teleportation channel, and when Zhao Fu stretched out his hand, he saw the names \u2018Holy Light City,\u2019 \u2018Soldier Forest,\u2019 and \u2018Demon Tree City\u2019.Zhao Fu thought for a moment, and Bai Qi and he both put on black cloaks to cover their appearances \u2013 he didn\u2019t want their appearances and identities to be revealed. As for where they were going to go, Zhao Fu thought about the Undead in the passage, so he chose Holy Light City. After a dizzying feeling swept over them, Zhao Fu and Bai Qi arrived at a very large stage. There was a heavy crossbow set up nearby, and there were many soldiers standing guard. Whenever something happened, they would immediately turn off the teleportation channel and kill any enemies that had entered.Zhao Fu casually looked around before they went to a large street. The street was quite wide, and it was filled with shops. There were many people on the street, and it was bustling with activity.Something interesting was that all sorts of players had their own stands to sell equipment and skills, and most of them were quite ordinary.Zhao Fu looked around with interest. Because he didn\u2019t have anything planned, he just wanted to have a look around the city.As he walked along the street, Zhao Fu realized just how massive Holy Light City was. It was able to rival the grand, ancient cities of the past, and it could easily accommodate more than 1 million people. It would take at least a few days to walk around the entire city by foot.Soon, Zhao Fu and Bai Qi arrived at the Quest Centre.There were 5 stone steles that were 4 meters tall and 2 meters wide. From left to right, they displayed different levels of quests, which were split into Easy, Normal, Difficult, Nightmare, and Hell.Easy quests usually required the person to help people with fairly simple tasks such as finding ordinary materials.The first stone stele was surrounded by people who were waiting for quests. Right now, 1 copper coin was worth $10, and completing just a few of these was already better than their normal wages. As such, many people were drawn to spending most of their time in the Heaven Awaken World.The second stone stele was the Normal Quest Stone Stele, and there were also many people there, making it impossible for Zhao Fu to squeeze in.The third stone stele was the Difficult Quest Stone Stele. There were much fewer people here because the quests usually entailed killing the leader of an Outlander tribe or finding a rare material.Zhao Fu went to the fifth stone stele, the Hell Quest Stone Stele, and looked at the quests to satisfy his curiosity.1. Kill [Six Eyed Demon Flood Dragon]: Quest Description: The Six-Eyed Demon Flood Dragon is a Lord grade being that lives in the deepest part of the Forest of Horrors. Its strength is so terrifying that it can cause one to fall into the pit of despair. Rewards: 100,000 Merit Points and 1 piece of Legendary grade equipment.2. Kill [Orc Kaki]: Quest Description: The Lord of a small Orc city situated north of the Forest of Horrors who commands 40,000 or so Orcs. Rewards: 50,000 Merit Points and 1 piece of Legendary grade equipment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu3. Search for [Saint Origin Fruit]: Description: Saint Origin Fruit, a Grade 7 Medicinal Grass that can heal all wounds and change one\u2019s grade. Reward: 20,000 Merit Points and 1 piece of Gold grade equipment.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After looking through these quests, Zhao Fu realized that the Six-Eyed Demon Flood Dragon was the biggest Boss in the Forest of Horrors, and it was most likely an existence that even main cities did not dare to offend. Who could complete such a quest?The second quest required one to kill an Orc called Kaki, and it also seemed quite impossible \u2013 the 40,000 Orcs would not just sit by and do nothing. At the same time, Zhao Fu understood that there were no main cities north of the Forest of Horrors because there were powerful Outlanders there.The third quest completely depended on one\u2019s luck. Someone might be incredibly lucky and fall into some sort of cave that had the Saint Origin Fruit. However, Zhao Fu was not attracted by the third quest\u2019s rewards because Bai Qi already had a Gold grade weapon, so Gold grade weapons were no longer as alluring to Zhao Fu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Suddenly, someone cried out behind him.Zhao Fu turned around and saw a beautiful woman with delicate and exquisite facial features and a graceful and charming bearing. She was wearing a light green dress and gave off a gentle and weak aura, making those who saw her want to protect her.Her status seemed to be quite extraordinary as well. She was followed by 10 or so people, some of whom seemed to be in charge of protecting her while the others seemed to be a part of the same family, and they all gave off extraordinary auras. Right now, the Heaven Awaken World was a world for powerful families, and normal people simply could not compare to those from powerful families.Nearby, a pompous young man saw the young woman and a look of delight appeared on his face as he loudly called out, \u201cRou\u2019Er!\u201dFollowing this, he took a group of thugs over and passed by Zhao Fu and Bai Qi.The young woman addressed as Rou\u2019Er slightly frowned when she saw the pompous young man.The thugs saw two people wearing cloaks, and they felt quite displeased that the cloaked men had the audacity to stand in their way. They were used to acting without regard for others, and one of them said, \u201cPiss off! You peasants saw the young master coming, yet you\u2019re not getting out of the way? You\u2019re seeking death!\u201dBai Qi coldly harrumphed. He could endure humiliation, but how could he let someone humiliate Zhao Fu, the future Emperor of Great Qin? When the thugs were about to grab Zhao Fu, Bai Qi immediately acted. He sent one of the thugs flying 7 or 8 meters with one punch before quickly beating the others to the brink of death.The pompous young man looked at Bai Qi with fear and said in a threatening tone, \u201cI\u2019m the Zhou family\u2019s second young master; if you dare to touch me, you\u2019ll die a pitiful death.\u201dIn response, Bai Qi sent the pompous young man flying with a kick.The onlookers were incredibly shocked when they saw the pompous young man sent flying, but they also felt quite happy. Most of them had been bullied or offended by him at some point, and they couldn\u2019t help but wonder who the cloaked men were to dare to hit the Zhao family\u2019s young master.Nearby, Bai Qi\u2019s ferocious actions made Zhao Fu feel quite awkward. Zhao Fu knew that Bai Qi was more suited to leading troops in battle, but Zhao Fu didn\u2019t have many capable people by his side, and Bai Qi\u2019s stats were already quite good. As such, Zhao Fu could only use him as a bodyguard for now. After the Great Qin Village became stronger, Bai Qi would definitely be the Grand General.From the pompous young man\u2019s words, he was most likely a member of one of the powerful families around Holy Light City. Moreover, because fighting was not allowed in main cities, Guards would soon come. Guards began as Stage 1 soldiers, and they could cultivate, making them stronger and stronger as time went on.Zhao Fu didn\u2019t want to bring himself any unnecessary trouble, so he said, \u201cYou can stop now!\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty!\u201d Bai Qi replied as he cupped his fists together.The normal people nearby did not notice anything, but the young woman and the people from her family paused in surprise. They knew what this title meant: only someone with an Empire legacy deserved to be called Your Majesty, while those from ordinary families could only be called Young Master.No wonder they dared to openly hit the member of the Zhou family \u2013 they did not place the Zhou family in their eyes at all, and in fact, the Zhou family might even have to send people to apologize.Just as Zhao Fu was about to take Bai Qi and leave, a soft voice said from behind him, \u201cSir, can you wait a moment?\u201dZhao Fu turned around to look at the young woman addressed as \u2018Rou\u2019Er\u2019 and softly asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe young woman smiled and stepped up, saying, \u201cThis little woman is the Jiang family\u2019s Jiang Rou; I wonder if I can make friends with sir.\u201dSince the person in front of her was the Legatee of an empire legacy, his status was incredibly distinguished, and he would be the future leader of a powerful family. Any family would want to befriend such a person.Zhao Fu turned and looked at Jiang Rou and thought for a moment before replying, \u201cPerhaps in the future if we have the chance. I have some things to do, so I\u2019ll be leaving now!\u201dEven though Zhao Fu didn\u2019t like the descendants of large families, since she had treated him with respect, he would also respond with respect.\u201cCan you tell me your name then?\u201dJiang Rou was disappointed by Zhao Fu\u2019s refusal, but she still wanted to learn more about him and find out which empire\u2019s Legatee he was.Now, no matter if it was Holy Light City, Demon Tree City, or Soldier Forest, all of them were occupied by powerful families. Now that an empire\u2019s Legatee had suddenly appeared, the situation in the Forest of Horrors would once again change.Zhao Fu thought about it and chose not to tell her his full name. Instead, he only told her that his surname was Zhao before quickly leaving.Soon, the news that an empire\u2019s Legatee had appeared in Holy Light City spread throughout the Forest of Horrors. Even though the main cities were not connected, teleportation channels from player villages could be connected to any of the 3 main cities. As such, the players in Demon Tree City and Soldier Forest quickly heard about this as well.Zhao Fu and Bai Qi arrived at a shop, and Zhao Fu asked, \u201cHello! Do you have any Holy Light type skills here?\u201dThe shop owner was delighted that some customers had come in, and he took out three skills for Zhao Fu to choose from.The first was [Holy Light Technique], an F- grade skill, the lowest type of Holy Light skill. If it was used against a Human, he or she would only feel a powerful light shining on them, while Demons and Undead would be burned and banished. This skill cost 20 silver coins.Zhao Fu thought that the price was quite steep. Normal F- grade Physical skills only cost 10 or so copper coins, but this skill cost 20 silver coins, which was equivalent to 2,000 copper coins. However, when Zhao Fu saw that Fireball, an F grade skill, cost one gold coin, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t have anything to say.Th second Holy Light skill was [Holy Light Bullet], and F grade skill, which was similar to Fireball. It had explosive effects and was slightly less powerful than Fireball, but it dealt extra damage to Demons and Undead. This skill cost 70 silver coins.The third skill was [Holy Hall Magic Seal], a C- grade skill. After using it, a sun-like imprint would appear on one\u2019s palm, allowing one to deal massive amounts of damage to enemies. The price for this skill was 30 gold coins.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the third skill\u2019s price. Even the powerful families that used money from the real world to trade for copper coins would only be able to make a few thousand copper coins in a day. This skill cost 30 gold coins, which was 300,000 copper coins. Even the powerful families wouldn\u2019t be able to afford such a thing.As such, Zhao Fu gave up on it and looked towards the first and second skill.In the end, Zhao Fu bought 20 Holy Light Techniques and 5 Holy Light Bullets, costing him 750 silver coins in total. Luckily, Zhao Fu had brought the Blue grade weapons to sell, or he would not have had enough money. After buying so many of the skills, the shop had barely any left.Afterwards, Zhao Fu went to Holy Light City\u2019s teleportation channel with Bai Qi, and he stretched out his hand, only the Great Qin Village\u2019s name appearing. This was because other villages had chosen to hide their teleportation channels \u2013 if one opened his or her teleportation channel to the public, anyone could be sent to his or her village, so Zhao Fu also chose for his teleportation channel to be hidden.Moreover, entering main cities through teleportation channels did not cost money, but leaving cost 20 copper coins. The money was automatically deducted by the system, and it was impossible to use the teleportation channel without enough money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were both males and females, and their Intelligence stats were relatively high. Now, there were 35 soldiers in total.Zhao Fu first gave the 10 Goblin Warriors and 10 Infantrymen the Holy Light Techniques. Since they were at the front, they could hide behind the shields while casting the Holy Light Technique.Because Archers were usually quite far away from the fighting, Zhao Fu did not give them any of the skills. After the Archers received Refined Martial Souls, their archery became incredibly sharp and precise. If the Skeletons were unprepared, the Archers could pierce through their heads each time with almost complete certainty.As for the 5 new people, Zhao Fu gave them the Holy Light Bullet to learn.Now, it was time to test the effectiveness of these skills. They went to a passage that had not been sealed and slowly advanced in the darkness. Soon, 10 or so Skeletons came to life and raised their weapons as they rushed over.The Goblin Warriors and Infantrymen did not panic. The Goblin Warriors raised their shields and then cast the Holy Light Technique. Rays of blinding white light fell on the Skeleton soldiers, and white smoke started to rise from their bodies as they howled and retreated.The rays of white light continued to land on their bodies, instantly reducing their fighting strength by a third. As the rays of white light appeared, the incredibly dark passage seemed to be as bright as day, and it was even slightly blinding.At this moment, 5 orbs of white light flew from behind the shield wall, falling within the group of retreating Skeletons.Bang! Bang! Bang\u2026The orbs of light exploded with blinding white light. More than half of the Skeletons howled before collapsing into a pile of bones, and the remaining Skeletons were barely still alive. The surviving Skeletons were easily killed by the Infantrymen with their iron hammers.Now, the Skeleton soldiers didn\u2019t pose a threat to Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers, and they suppressed whatever Skeletons they came across. As they continued onwards, they easily killed a few more waves. Even when they encountered Skeleton Captains, they were only slightly troublesome to deal with. Zhao Fu and his strongest subordinates did not even have to do anything.Zhao Fu thought about it for a moment before leaving matters here to Li Wen. Zhao Fu told him to continue exploring and to notify him if he encountered any Skeleton Generals. Following this, Zhao Fu took Bai Qi and his other main subordinates aboveground to take care of other matters.Zhao Fu now had an abundance of Refined Martial Souls, and he was not stingy with them. He gave them to his soldiers to use \u2013 after all, with the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation, he didn\u2019t have to worry about their grades.After returning to the surface, Zhao Fu took Little Grey and some others to patrol around the area in the hopes of finding a village that he could annex. Right now, Zhao Fu\u2019s forces numbered less than 500, and he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat the Orc Village.Zhao Fu left behind some soldiers to stand guard while he took 300 soldiers with him to patrol about. Now, with Little Grey, as long as there was even a hint of a human\u2019s smell, Little Grey would be able to follow it to a village.Right now, Little Grey was pressed against the ground and sniffing around. Despite being a Wolf King, doing this showed that it was completely loyal to Zhao Fu. As it did this, Zhao Fu followed by its side.\u201cAwooo\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Little Grey seemed to detect something and howled before looking up at Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu nodded. In response, Little Grey rushed off, and Zhao Fu called out for everyone to follow closely.Zhao Fu and his soldiers started to run behind Little Grey until they came to a hill. Beneath them was a Human Village.The village seemed to be an Intermediate Village, and it had 600 or so people. However, the defenses were quite weak, and the management was quite poor. The houses were not built uniformly, and there were very few plots of farmland. It was evident that the Lord had very poor management skills.How should he conquer this village? Zhao Fu frowned. The only weakness of this village was its weak defense. This was an ordinary village, so poison wouldn\u2019t work because the villagers most likely cooked their own meals. The village also had some farmland, so not many villagers would go out to hunt. As such, it seemed that the only method available to them was to attack directly, but this would result in many casualties.In the end, they could only wait for an opportunity. The sun was setting, and it was getting darker. Zhao Fu decided to find a hidden place to make camp, and he wanted to see what they could discover the next day.Even though the moon did not come out, the sky was lit with countless stars, which was quite a beautiful sight.However, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t have the heart right now to marvel at the beautiful stars. Instead, he frowned as he asked, \u201cBai Qi, what are your thoughts about this situation?\u201dBai Qi thought for a moment before replying, \u201cIf we simply can\u2019t find any openings, we\u2019ll have to wait until 3 to 4 AM when people are deep asleep or weary from standing guard. The village\u2019s defenses are quite weak, so the chance of success is quite high.\u201dZhao Fu nodded. If there was nothing else, they would have to make a direct attack.It was early in the morning, and the sun rose slowly from the east. Zhao Fu got up early and looked down at the village.After a while, a big, muscular, coarse-looking man, who held a saber and had a bow on his back, led 10 or so men with similar equipment out of the village. It seemed that they were going out to hunt.After thinking about it, Zhao Fu immediately went to gather his forces.\u201cBig brother Hu! We definitely have to catch a big wild boar today so that everyone can have some meat!\u201d One of the youths said excitedly to the big man.The big man candidly smiled as he replied, \u201cAlright, let alone one wild boar, your big brother Hu will catch three wild boars for you.\u201dThe youth looked at the man with respect as he said, \u201cOkay! I believe in big brother Hu. Since you\u2019re the strongest person in our village, if you can\u2019t do it, then no one can.\u201dThe big man laughed cheerfully. However, in the next second, his smile died as he looked around with a serious expression.When the youth saw the sudden change in the big man, the youth asked curiously, \u201cWhat is it, big brother Hu?\u201dThe big man looked around and said in a low voice, \u201cEnemies!\u201dEveryone else also heard what he said and became alert. The hunters grouped together and looked around them, but they could not spot anything. Everyone felt that the big man was wrong and looked towards him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSirs, there\u2019s no need to hide. I\u2019ve already detected you!\u201d The big man suddenly yelled.Even though they had not been fully surrounded, Zhao Fu knew that it was impossible for them to escape, so he revealed himself with the rest of his soldiers.The big man and the other people in his group saw the long grass in front of them shake as Infantry, Archers, and Gnome Crossbowmen rose up, causing their faces to pale.\u201cWho are you, sir? Why do you want to kill the Great Tiger Village\u2019s people?\u201dThe big man\u2019s face was quite pale \u2013 even though he had sensed danger, he did not expect there to be so many people. When he saw the arrows and crossbows pointed at them, he knew that there was no chance of escaping.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Zhao Fu still answered him, \u201cFor your village!\u201dZhao Fu then looked over and ordered, \u201cLeave a few of them alive!\u201dThe Archers and Crossbowmen were about to fire when the big man quickly called out, \u201cI\u2019m the Village Chief of the Great Tiger Village, Zhang Dahu!\u201dZhao Fu was quite surprised when he heard this. He hadn\u2019t expected the big man in front of him to be the Village Chief, so he immediately called out, \u201cStop!\u201dZhang Dahu let out a sigh of relief. He knew from listening to Zhao Fu and seeing how well-equipped and ferocious his soldiers were that the Great Tiger Village would face disaster if Zhao Fu attacked it.At this moment, Zhao Fu was looking at Zhang Dahu and wondering what to do. How he could use this big chess piece to take the Great Tiger Village.\u201cWhy do you want our village?\u201d Zhang Dahu suddenly asked while looking at Zhao Fu earnestly.Zhao Fu did not plan to hide anything and simply replied, \u201cTo stop the 5,000 Orcs that are 100 kilometers away!\u201d\u201cWhat? 5,000 Orcs?\u201dZhang Dahu and his people were incredibly shocked. As residents of the Heaven Awaken World, they knew how terrifying the Outlanders were.Orcs normally never left Humans alive. If 5,000 Orcs came over and discovered the Great Tiger Village, not a single one of them would survive.Since Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers were well-equipped, perhaps they could stop the Orcs. In that case, joining Zhao Fu would not be too bad because Zhang Dahu was not skilled at management. However, if they joined just like that, the Great Tiger Village would seem much too weak. Furthermore, they didn\u2019t have to join \u2013 they just had to work together.Because of this, Zhang Dahu decided to test Zhao Fu\u2019s strength as well as show his own power, so he pointed at Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers and said, \u201cThe Great Tiger Village will not easily submit to anyone. I see that the pretty boy next to you seems to be a decent fighter. If he can beat me, I\u2019ll join your village; if I win, we\u2019ll only work together to stop the Orcs, and you\u2019ll need to supply us with equipment.\u201d\u201cPretty boy?\u201d Zhao Fu felt quite confused. He looked over and saw that Zhang Dahu was pointing at Bai Qi, and Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but smile, thinking, \u201cThis fellow dares to call Bai Qi a pretty boy and wants to challenge him? He\u2019s simply seeking death.\u201dZhao Fu thought about it, and since he benefited whether Bai Qi lost or won, Zhao Fu decided to agree. Plus, he was quite confident that Bai Qi would win.Zhang Dahu took off his bow and pulled out his large saber. When Bai Qi started walking forwards, Zhang Dahu said, \u201cWatch out, pretty boy, don\u2019t blame me if you get hurt.\u201dThose who knew Bai Qi\u2019s strength said some prayers for Zhang Dahu.The battle began!Zhang Dahu raised his large saber and chopped down at Bai Qi ferociously. Bai Qi\u2019s expression was incredibly calm, and he did not move at all. Just as the large saber was about to hit him, a ray of sword light flashed.Clang!A metallic clanging sound rang out as Zhang Dahu felt a massive impact against his saber, almost causing it to fly out from his grasp.In the next second, a cold light flashed as Zhang Dahu saw Bai Qi thrust his sword towards his neck. He quickly used his large saber to block Bai Qi\u2019s sword when Bai Qi spun, lashing out with a side kick and sending him flying.Zhang Dahu fell to the ground and looked unconvinced as he got up. He rushed over at Bai Qi and was beaten down again in a few bouts. Zhang Dahu was dumbfounded. He was quite confident in his strength because the Great Tiger Village would have been destroyed by Outlanders long ago if it wasn\u2019t for him. How could this pretty boy be so strong?\u201cWait, I admit defeat.\u201dBy now, Zhang Dahu\u2019s saber had long since been sent flying away, and Bai Qi didn\u2019t bother using his sword either. He smashed his fist into the big man\u2019s face repeatedly, making him feel immense pain.Zhang Dahu knew that he should have surrendered long ago, so after taking a few blows to the face, he decided to finally surrender.Bai Qi stopped attacking and returned to Zhao Fu\u2019s side when he heard Zhang Dahu surrender.Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but smile. Zhang Dahu had dug himself a hole and had even jumped into it. He had even called Bai Qi a pretty boy \u2013 now, he had been taught a good lesson.\u201cYou\u2019ve lost. Do you still remember what we agreed on before?\u201d Zhao Fu said to Zhang Dahu as he suppressed his smile and walked over.Zhang Dahu sighed and knelt on one knee as he cupped his fists, saying, \u201cThose who are prepared to bet must be prepared to lose. I respectfully greet Sir!\u201dZhao Fu received a system announcement that asked him if he wanted to accept Zhang Dahu\u2019s surrender. Zhao Fu accepted and received 100 Achievement Points.Following this, Zhao Fu looked at Zhang Dahu\u2019s stats with interest.Name: Zhang DahuGrade: SSTitle: NoneProfession: MilitiaAchievement Points: Citizen (24/500)Race: HumanAge: 31 (100)Loyalty: 60Stats: Strength: 10, Intelligence: 6, Constitution: 10, Agility: 8Cultivation: Stage 0Cultivation Technique: NoneSkills: Basic Saber TechniqueEquipment: Coarse Cloth Clothes, Cloth Shoes, Coarse Cloth PantsZhao Fu was quite shocked when he saw Zhang Dahu\u2019s stats. Zhang Dahu was SS grade, but he did not have a cultivation technique and his profession was only Militia, giving him only a basic skill. And yet, he did not look too weak. After joining the Great Qin Village and receiving all sorts of benefits, Zhang Dahu would become vastly more powerful, and he would become a valiant general.Nearby, everyone in the peaceful Great Tiger Village suddenly heard a system announcement, sending the village into chaos.Luckily, Zhang Dahu quickly returned and calmed everyone down. However, they still looked quite fearful when they saw Zhao Fu and his soldiers. It was because there were not only soldiers in plate armor but also Goblins and Gnomes among his 300 soldiers. After all, most Humans were quite afraid of Outlanders.Zhao Fu went to the Village Hall and looked at the Great Tiger Village\u2019s stats. However, he felt slightly disappointed when he saw them. It was only a Normal grade Village, and it had only recently risen to Intermediate level.The Great Tiger Village was about 15 kilometers away from the Great Qin Village, so Zhao Fu planned to take all of the villagers to the Great Qin Village to fill in the gaps he had.After choosing to [Relocate] the Great Tiger Village, a system announcement sounded out, telling Zhao Fu that the Great Qin Village had received 540 EXP.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was the most EXP he had obtained from Relocating a village, but because it was an Intermediate Village, it would go back down to a Primary Village. However, there was nothing Zhao Fu could do about this \u2013 the Great Tiger Village was simply too far away from the Great Qin Village, and if something happened, Zhao Fu would not be able to respond in time, so he had no choice but to relocate it.A few hours later, Zhao Fu took the villagers to the Great Qin Village. When the Great Tiger Village\u2019s villagers saw how powerful the Great Qin Village was, they secretly felt delighted and safe. After seeing how well-organized and managed everything in the Great Qin Village was, Zhang Dahu felt quite embarrassed. He felt that his own village had been like a doghouse compared to the Great Qin Village.Now that 600 or so people had joined the Great Qin Village, the Great Qin Village had 1,340 villagers. Considering the Orcs, Zhao Fu arranged for 300 of them to change professions, boosting his military to 600 soldiers.As for Zhang Dahu, Zhao Fu did not mistreat him at all. He first allowed him to change professions before giving him a Refined Martial Soul, a Silver grade saber, and Blue grade armor.After receiving so many benefits so suddenly, Zhang Dahu couldn\u2019t help but feel ecstatic, and his loyalty greatly increased.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In total, Zhao Fu\u2019s overall forces numbered around 720. However, even though their numbers had been greatly boosted, it was still far from enough to deal with 5,000 Orcs.Zhao Fu gave the 300 new soldiers to Bai Qi to be trained for a few days, while he took some soldiers to continue exploring the Forest of Horrors.Over the past few days, Zhao Fu explored 20 kilometers around the Great Qin Village and did not find any villages. However, he did find some small iron mines but no other resources. This made Zhao Fu feel somewhat disappointed. After regrouping at the Great Qin Village, he took his 600 soldiers and started to head outside of the 20-kilometer radius around the Great Qin Village.Little Grey followed along and sniffed the ground. It had not found anything over the past few days, and the pressure on it was quite heavy.\u201cAwoo\u2026\u201dLittle Grey suddenly detected something and howled, waiting for Zhao Fu\u2019s command. After Zhao Fu gave the signal, it immediately rushed towards the smell.Zhao Fu and his people followed behind it.After running for a while, Zhao Fu felt quite pleased because he started to see horse tracks on the ground. From the very beginning, Zhao Fu had been looking for horses, and he had finally found some traces of them.Zhao Fu excitedly ran behind Little Grey, and he finally found 10 or so horses on a grassy plain. The horses were tall and powerfully-built, and their hair was completely black. However, their eyes were slightly green, making them look quite strange.After observing them, Zhao Fu received some information about the horses.[Black Forest Horse]: Description: A type of horse that lives in forests and has good physical power. It is skilled at passing over obstacles.After reading the Black Forest Horse\u2019s description, Zhao Fu felt that they were well suited to become warhorses. He thought about the method he had used to capture the Azure Oxen but realized that it wouldn\u2019t work.First of all, these 10 or so horses were treasures. Moreover, their legs were not as strong as the oxen\u2019s legs, and if they were frightened, they would run incredibly quickly. As such, if they used the same method, it was possible that the horses would be crippled.After thinking for a long time, Zhao Fu decided to go with the traditional method. He made lassos out of rope to throw around the horses\u2019 necks. This was often done in the real world and would not cause much harm to the horses.However, catching horses through this method required great skill. Since the 10 or so Black Forest Horses hadn\u2019t discovered them yet, Zhao Fu chose 10 or so of his soldiers to practice for a bit.Right now, they could only rely on these 10 or so people. If too many people went, it was likely that they would be discovered. Animals were not to be looked down upon.After 10 minutes of practice, the soldiers gripped their ropes and slowly crawled towards the horses. The plan went quite smoothly, but when it came to throwing the lassos, things did not go too well. The Black Forest Horses were too alert, and they were only able to capture 8 of them while they missed 7.Now that the horses had been frightened, they immediately started running incredibly quickly. Even the lassoed horses started to run, and because of how strong they were, they started to drag the soldiers along. Luckily, the soldiers who hadn\u2019t lassoed horses helped them. However, it still took two soldiers to slow down a Black Forest Horse, and they were still being dragged along.Zhao Fu immediately ordered more soldiers to go and help. He rode on Little Grey, who was now about as big as a tiger and could carry Zhao Fu on its back as it ran.Now that he had finally encountered horses, Zhao Fu did not want to let any get away.Zhao Fu sat on Little Grey\u2019s back and hugged its body. Little Grey was very fast and had a sensitive nose, so it quickly chased after the Black Forest Horses.After a while, Zhao Fu told Little Grey to stop because he heard many horses ahead. This gave Zhao Fu a pleasant surprise, and he silently crept up to have a look.There was a grassy plain around 6 kilometers in diameter that had around 300 or so Black Forest Horses within it. What Zhao Fu was interested in was a stage made of brick that had a horse-shaped statue. Clearly, it was a Den.Zhao Fu immediately rode Little Grey back and brought all his soldiers here. When Bai Qi saw so many Black Forest Horses, he cheerfully exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Great Qin to have Cavalry!\u201dZhang Dahu also laughed cheerfully, \u201cI want to have my own warhorse!\u201dHowever, Zhang Dahu\u2019s voice was quite loud, and he almost scared the horses. Everyone glared at him and he awkwardly scratched his head, gesturing that he would be careful in the future.Liu Mei also excitedly came over and said, \u201cI also want my own horse!\u201dAfter discovering so many Black Forest Horses, everyone felt extremely excited. The question they now faced was how to catch the Black Forest Horses. Even though Zhao Fu had many soldiers, they couldn\u2019t just charge over.If they charged, the Black Forest Horses would attack as a group, and Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers would be forced to fight back. Zhao Fu did not want to kill any of the Black Forest Horses.Moreover, 300 Black Forest Horses were not the same as 300 Grey Wolves. If such a massive group of horses rushed at them, it would be quite dangerous, and there would be many injuries and casualties on Zhao Fu\u2019s side.Zhao Fu looked around and saw a Black Forest Horse that was twice as big as the normal Black Forest Horses. It was jet-black and looked incredibly powerful, and it had a small horn that was a few centimeters long on its head. It was the Black Forest Horse King.For most herd-type animals, as long as one could control the leader, it would be equivalent to controlling the entire herd. However, since the Black Forest Horse King was among the other horses, Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t do anything to it.Perhaps they could find a way to lure it out. Zhao Fu thought about it and finally looked over at Little Grey. He stroked its head, and Little Grey naively did not sense what Zhao Fu was thinking and comfortably rubbed its head against his hand.Zhao Fu smiled as he said, \u201cLittle Grey! How about you go and challenge the Black Forest Horse King to provoke into fighting you King against King. After that, lure it out.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLittle Grey immediately took a few steps away from Zhao Fu and looked quite reluctant. As the Grey Wolf King, Little Grey was quite powerful, but there was no way that it could face 300 Black Forest Horses. That was simply suicidal, and it wasn\u2019t willing to do such a thing.Zhao Fu lightly smiled, took out a small medicine bottle, and drew out two Little Spirit Pills. Zhao Fu walked over and fed them to Little Grey, and he stroked its head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry; if it\u2019s dangerous, you can just retreat. I won\u2019t let you get injured.\u201dAfter consuming the two Little Spirit Pills and hearing Zhao Fu\u2019s words, Little Grey thought for a moment before reluctantly agreeing. It leapt up and ran towards the horses from another direction.\u201cAwoooo!!\u201dLittle Grey\u2019s howl could be heard from over one kilometer away, and Little Grey gave off the domineering airs of a king as it walked towards the horses.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It whinnied, and just as Zhao Fu thought that his plan had succeeded, the 300 or so horses started to run at Little Grey instead of the Black Forest Horse King. The ground started to shake as if there was an earthquake, and the horses gave off a fearsome aura.Little Grey was scared and quickly ran away. Luckily, Little Grey was completely prepared and ran quite quickly, or it would have been stomped into a meat paste.After returning to Zhao Fu\u2019s side, Little Grey looked incredibly wronged as it howled pitifully. Zhao Fu awkwardly smiled and took out another Little Spirit Pill to comfort it. That plan had failed.Now, he could only think of a new plan. Zhao Fu sank into deep thought, and after a while, Zhao Fu once again looked at Little Grey. Facing Zhao Fu\u2019s gaze, Little Grey was already quite wary, and it prepared to run.Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but laugh, and he grabbed its tail and said, \u201cLittle Grey, what are you running for? Don\u2019t worry; you won\u2019t have to do anything this time but give commands.\u201dFollowing this, Zhao Fu told his plan to Little Grey. After hearing the plan, Little Grey reassuringly howled, signaling that it agreed.Apart from Little Grey, Zhao Fu also brought 6 normal Grey Wolves. This time, Zhao Fu ordered Little Grey to command the Grey Wolves to pretend to attack the Black Forest Horses in order to lure them out slowly.Everyone else also made preparations and formed an encirclement. Once this was completed, the plan began.\u201cAwoo! Awoo! Awoo!\u201dThe 6 Grey Wolves rushed out from within the forest and acted like they were going to attack. The Black Forest Horses did not take the Grey Wolves seriously. The Black Forest Horses obviously wouldn\u2019t attack with all 300 horses, and instead, only 20 or so horses started to gallop towards the Grey Wolves.The Grey Wolves immediately turned and ran, and the 20 or so Black Forest Horses chased after them. Since the Grey Wolves immediately fled, the Black Forest Horses decided to return to the herd.\u201cAwoo! Awoo! Awoo!\u201dThe Grey Wolves stopped and roared at them with a ferocious look, and they charged towards the 20 horses as if they were going to devour them. Facing the Grey Wolves\u2019 provocation, the 20 Black Forest Horses once again rushed towards them, vowing to stomp them into the ground.The Grey Wolves once again turned and ran, and they looked incredibly devious.These Black Forest Horses were very fast and filled with anger, causing them to run at their fastest speed. Soon, they started to catch up to the Grey Wolves.At this moment, lassos flew out from the grass nearby, falling on the Black Forest Horses\u2019 heads. After being lassoed so suddenly, the Black Forest Horses panicked and turned back to escape.However, the soldiers that threw the lassos quickly tied the other end of the rope to large trees.Three of the horses that had not been lassoed tried to run, but in the next second, countless lassos flew at them and captured them as well.Zhao Fu was quite happy to catch 20 or so Black Forest Horses in one go. When the horses tired themselves out, Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers started taming them.After this successful run, he continued using this method.The 6 Grey Wolves howled as they rushed out from the forest. The Black Forest Horses were not too intelligent, and they did not wonder where the previous Black Forest Horses had gone. Another 20 or so horses went to chase the Grey Wolves.After repeating this method many times, it gradually lost its effectiveness. Now, there were 100 or so Black Forest Horses remaining, and they all became alert. After so many horses had disappeared, they would have to be idiots not to realize that there was something wrong.\u201cAwooooo!\u201d Little Grey howled again as it walked out from the forest. This time, it did not look as wretched as when it was running away, and its mouth was instead curved like a human\u2019s smile, making it look quite pleased.The Black Forest Horse King looked at Little Grey furiously and understood that Little Grey was somehow involved in all of this.The Black Forest Horse King whinnied as it led the charge towards Little Grey to crush the despicable wolf.When Little Grey saw the Black Forest Horse King personally rush over with 100 or so Black Forest Horses behind it, Little Grey immediately ran away.In the next second, a lasso flew towards the Black Forest Horse King and fell around its neck. Now that the Black Forest Horse King had been caught, the rest of the Black Forest Horses panicked.The Black Forest Horse King whinnied furiously and leaping high into the air as it ran. The 5 soldiers gripping the rope lost their balance and were dragged behind it.Another lasso fell around the Black Forest Horse King\u2019s neck. This time, Bai Qi also acted, yet they were still dragged away by the Black Forest Horse King.\u201cThis Black Forest Horse King is so strong!\u201dLassos continuously fell around the Black Forest Horse King\u2019s neck. In the end, it took 30 soldiers, Bai Qi, and Zhang Dahu to finally stop the Black Forest Horse King.After being caught by the lassos, the Black Forest Horse King continued to struggle, and they used all their strength to hold the ropes in place.Zhao Fu moved his attention from the Black Forest Horse King for now and made sure that the other horses were caught as well before turning back to the Black Forest Horse King.Even now, the Black Forest Horse King was still vigorously resisting. Zhao Fu was not in a hurry, and after waiting for a few hours, the Black Forest Horse King was tired to the point that it was lying on the ground and breathing heavily.Only then did Zhao Fu walk up and try to use Taming. However, the effects were the same as when he had tried to initially use it on Little Grey, and the Black Forest Horse King stubbornly resisted.At this moment, Little Grey rubbed against Zhao Fu as if it had an idea. Zhao Fu was quite surprised, but he allowed Little Grey to try.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLittle Grey ran over and quietly howled at the Black Forest Horse King, and Zhao Fu had no idea what Little Grey said. In response, the Black Forest Horse King turned its head away, completely ignoring Little Grey.Little Grey ran over and used its claws to hit the Black Forest Horse King\u2019s head a few times, infuriating it and causing it to want to stand up and teach Little Grey a lesson.However, it was already completely exhausted, and there were also many lassos binding it. As such, countless scratches appeared on its face, and there were many bites on its body.Zhao Fu could tell that this was Little Grey\u2019s revenge against the Black Forest Horse King for chasing Little Grey for so long. Zhao Fu smiled and called Little Grey to stop before going to the Black Forest Horse King\u2019s side and looking at it. He stretched out his hand and said, \u201cThis is your last chance. If you don\u2019t submit to me, I\u2019ll have to kill you!\u201dFollowing this, Zhao Fu used Taming, and the light from his palm covered the Black Forest Horse King\u2019s body. The Black Forest Horse King\u2019s green eyes looked at Zhao Fu as if it was considering something.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You have obtained the loyalty of a Chief class creature, the Black Forest Horse King.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! You have obtained 50 Achievement Points for subduing a Chief class creature.\u201dFinally, the Black Forest Horse King chose to give in, and Zhao Fu was able to successfully tame it. He felt quite happy as he opened the Black Forest Horse King\u2019s stats:[Black Forest Horse King] (Chief)Level: Stage 0-4Grade: SStats: Strength:10, Intelligence: 9, Agility: 21, Constitution: 14Skills: Horse King\u2019s Might (makes ordinary horses feel fear, making them submit), Nightmare Dash (runs at a very fast speed)After looking at its stats, Zhao Fu felt that the Black Forest Horse King was quite similar to Little Grey, and the only difference was in some stats. He told his soldiers to remove the lassos, and after everyone heard that the Black Forest Horse King had been conquered, they were quite delighted and went off to pick their own horses.After Zhao Fu went to the Den and touched the horse statue floating in the air, some information appeared in his mind.[Den \u2013 Black Forest Horse]: (Primary 1400/5000), Grade: White, Description: The Den of Black Forest Horses, spawns 2-5 Black Forest Horses per day.After seeing this information, Zhao Fu decided that if everything went smoothly, the Black Forest Horses would be the Great Qin\u2019s main warhorses, and they would conquer everything under the heavens with him.After Zhao Fu chose to conquer the Den and [Relocate] it, the Great Qin Village received 140 EXP and he received 50 Achievement Points. Now, Zhao Fu already had 463 Achievement Points, and he was 37 away from being promoted to Esquire.He had perfectly resolved the situation with the Black Forest Horses. At the end of it all, they had tamed 324 Black Forest Horses. Out of his 600 soldiers, Zhao Fu chose 200 to change their profession to Cavalry. Right now, the Great Qin Village was an Intermediate Village and would summon 24-29 new villagers per day. For now, Zhao Fu planned to increase the number of the other 3 professions before adding more Cavalry to keep a certain ratio of each type of soldier.Just like before, after taking care of matters in the Heaven Awaken World, Zhao Fu returned to the real world. Just as he was thinking of boiling some water to eat some instant noodles, someone knocked on his door, and he opened it in surprise.There were four men and one woman standing outside. The woman was wearing a suit and a short dress and wore a pair of sunglasses. She was holding a document folder and had good looks. The other 4 men wore suits as well and gave off deep auras. From that, Zhao Fu knew that they were not ordinary people.Just as Zhao Fu opened the door, he became quite wary, and he asked, \u201cDo you have any business with me?\u201dThe woman slightly smiled and introduced herself, \u201cHello! My name is Ji Qin, an employee at the Ying Family Collective. Are you Zhao Meiling\u2019s son, Zhao Fu?\u201dZhao Fu felt that this matter was not simple at all. He realized that there was no way of hiding since they had found him, so he nodded in response.Ji Qin continued, \u201cMr. Zhao, you have the Ying family\u2019s blood flowing in your veins. According to the Ying Family Collective\u2019s orders, we are here to invite you to come with us to the Ying family. Don\u2019t worry; we won\u2019t hurt you, and this is a great opportunity for you. In the Ying family, you won\u2019t have to do anything, and the Ying family will give you a good life.\u201dZhao Fu instantly realized what this was all about. The powerful families were gathering everyone who had their bloodlines. After all, they were part of the same family, and these people could be beneficial to helping them grow and consolidate in the future.The Ying Family Collective had most likely come to find him because his mother\u2019s relatives had gone and returned to the main family. The descendants of his maternal grandpa and grandma most likely had the Ying family\u2019s blood.After entering the Heaven Awaken World, they would be notified of their bloodlines, and with the Ying family giving them such good treatment, why wouldn\u2019t they return to the main family? This was most likely how they had found out about Zhao Fu.By now, Zhao Fu had more or less worked everything out, and his expression became calm as he replied, \u201cNo need, I prefer being by myself.\u201dJi Qin once again smiled, but her tone changed and became more assertive, saying, \u201cApologies, Mr. Zhao, but this is an order from the Ying Family Collective. All descendants of the Ying family must return to the family.\u201dZhao Fu frowned \u2013 it was a bit too domineering to force him to go with them. However, he realized that it was because the Ying family had not found the Legatee of Great Qin after such a long time and was probably going mad over it, which was why the Ying family decided to do such a thing.Now, Zhao Fu had 2 choices: to return with them to the Ying family or to escape.The second option simply wasn\u2019t feasible. If he escaped, he would be a person of suspicion, and he would not be able to hide forever from a big family. He would be caught sooner or later, and if that was the case, it would be better to simply go with them now.As such, Zhao Fu cooperatively nodded as he said, \u201cAlright, please wait for a moment. I\u2019ll get my things.\u201dJi Qin smiled in a friendly way and nodded.After going into his room, Zhao Fu looked around and felt that there wasn\u2019t much worth taking. He picked up a bag and put in a few sets of clothes and the important Heaven Awaken Stone before leaving with Ji Qin.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.In the Li family\u2019s villa, the butler had been monitoring Zhao Fu the entire time. As such, when Zhao Fu was taken away by the Ying family, the butler immediately heard about it and told the Li family\u2019s leader, Li Feng.Li Feng was quite angry, but he heavily sighed as he said, \u201cWho would have thought that he also possessed the Great Qin\u2019s bloodline. If we knew about this, allowing Zhe\u2019Er to marry her wouldn\u2019t have been a bad thing. In fact, it might have given our families an opportunity to work together.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, Li Feng\u2019s gaze became cold. That bastard child will definitely attain a good position in the Ying family considering his personality and abilities.Now, Zhao Fu was able to slightly threaten the Li family, and it was possible that he would obstruct the Li family\u2019s growth and harm his darling grandson and the Great Tang Empire\u2019s future. The best thing to do right now was to kill him.Of course, if they killed Zhao Fu, they might offend the Ying family, so Li Feng said with a serious expression to the butler, \u201cFind someone else to take care of him, and make sure that the Li family is not connected to the death. Otherwise, the consequences will be terrible \u2013 even though the Ying family hasn\u2019t found its Legatee yet, none of the Five Great Families can be easily angered!\u201dThe butler nodded with a serious expression and left the room to find an assassin to dispose of Zhao Fu.On the other hand, Zhao Fu had no idea about any of this. Instead, he was completely shocked by the Ying family\u2019s resources. He was put on a private jet with some other people who had the Ying family\u2019s blood, and they flew to the Ying Family\u2019s headquarters in Nankou City.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123A few hours later, Zhao Fu arrived at Nankou City in the private jet. There was then a private car to take Zhao Fu and the others to a high-class district.The high-class district that Zhao Fu was taken to was one of the Ying family\u2019s assets. Not only was the scenery around it quite good, but the security was also quite high as well. There were a couple thousand people living here, and all of them had the Ying family\u2019s bloodline. Of course, these people were not from the main branch of the Ying family \u2013 those who were from the main branch lived in an even better place.Here, Zhao Fu met his maternal grandparents. After they hugged him and cried for a while, they asked him why he hadn\u2019t returned to live with them.Zhao Fu was grateful that he was able to see his maternal grandparents. As for why he hadn\u2019t returned to live with them, it was because he didn\u2019t want to be a burden to anyone. They were getting to be quite old, and Zhao Fu was unfamiliar with his other relatives on that side of the family. His maternal relatives were quite cold towards him, so he was not very interested in staying in contact with them.Afterwards, Zhao Fu was given his own house. It was about 100 square meters in area and luxuriously decorated. There were all sorts of electronic appliances, and it was clear just how wealthy the Ying family was.After turning on his brand-new computer, Zhao Fu went onto the Heaven Awaken World forum out of habit to see if there was any news. Right now, the other powers were developing slowly because creating a massive enterprise was something that took many months and years and could not be done in an instant.Because the regions were all separated, many of the powerful families were fragmented and separated into different places. As such, they established guilds to recruit normal people. Of course, these normal people could not be disciplined and controlled like in the military because who would want to do such a thing after living in comfort in the real world?Moreover, after players died, the penalties were incredibly onerous. Players lost all of their levels and equipment upon death, and they would not be able to enter the Heaven Awaken World for 10 days. Those who were not Lords would also randomly spawn in another place. Essentially, the players that guilds recruited were not very reliable and very few became elites that were nurtured by the large families.Apart from the large and powerful families, there were also ordinary people who were doing quite well. After all, it was not just the large families that had great ambitions \u2013 chaotic times often produced heroes, and every person, regardless of birth, could become someone great. Even ordinary people who were not from large families were able to rise above the masses.\u201cGu Jun led hundreds of players to take down a mountain stronghold with 1,000 people!\u201d\u201cLiu Xiuming took hundreds of people to destroy 3 Outlander Villages!\u201d\u201cJiang Changshui received the recognition of a village and became the Village Chief of Sanjiang Village, obtaining 600 villagers!\u201dAfter looking through these threads, Zhao Fu once again returned to the Heaven Awaken World. Compared to the real world, Zhao Fu felt a greater sense of belonging in the Heaven Awaken World.After returning to the Heaven Awaken World and thinking about everything he had read on the forum, Zhao Fu felt a sense of pressure. He realized he could not be careless and started to carry out a census.Right now, the Great Qin Village had 1,340 people, and there were 4 other Human Villages, 3 Goblin Villages, and 1 Gnome Village.After these few days, those villages had gradually recovered. The 4 other Human Villages collectively had 524 people, the 3 Goblin Villages had 410 Goblins, and the Gnome Village had 189 Gnomes.Zhao Fu went to the different villages and chose some more people to become Great Qin Soldiers. Now, there were 930 Great Qin soldiers, 150 Goblin soldiers, and 100 Gnome soldiers for a total of 1,180 soldiers.However, Outlanders could also change their professions into Great Qin Soldier. There was no limit to how many Great Qin Soldiers there could be, nor were there any race requirements. It was just that each village had a military limit, and any additional soldier would not receive that village\u2019s stats.As such, all 1,180 soldiers were Great Qin Soldiers, and they received the stat bonuses from their professions. 35 of them were responsible for exploring the passages, 245 were responsible for protecting the village, and Zhao Fu led the other 900.Zhao Fu led these 900 Soldiers and explored the region outside of the surrounding 20-kilometer radius. Things were much more convenient now with horses, but only a minority of them knew how to ride. As such, most of the soldiers still walked \u2013 after all, there were only 200 Cavalrymen.Right now, Zhao Fu was riding Little Black, the Black Forest Horse King, at the front of the army while Little Grey walked beside them and sniffed around.Suddenly, Little Grey discovered something. It howled before running forwards, and Zhao Fu followed behind it on Little Black.After a while, they discovered an Intermediate Village on a plain. It was an Outlander Village, and the beings that lived there had the head of a dog and the body of a human, looking quite like Kobolds.It was a Kobold Village and had roughly 1,000 Kobolds. There were 700 Kobold soldiers and the remaining 300 were all elderly, women, or children.The Kobold soldiers either held sabers or spears. Zhao Fu did not dare to get too close to observe because it was possible that their noses would be as sensitive as a normal dog\u2019s.1,000 Kobolds was quite a large force. If there were only 500 or 600 Kobolds, they could wait until night time to ambush the village.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201dZhao Fu suddenly thought of something and looked over at Little Grey. Little Grey, who had completed its task and was lying down to rest, suddenly felt a chill and turned to see Zhao Fu looking at it with an evil look. Immediately, Little Grey felt like running away.This time, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t have to do anything. Little Black bit Little Grey\u2019s tail as revenge for the bullying from before. How could it give up a chance to take revenge?Little Grey turned around and howled to tell Little Black to let go. Little Grey knew from his shameless owner\u2019s look that he was having wicked thoughts.Little Black also whinnied as it held on and seemed to smile as it revealed its white teeth. It seemed to be saying, \u201c _Heheh, the one who\u2019s going to suffer is you, not me; I\u2019m just being a good and obedient boy!\u201d_Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLittle Grey was incredibly furious and turned to bite Little Black, that shameless horse. However, Little Black held on and constantly dodged.Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but lightly laugh and said, \u201cAlright, you can both stop!\u201dIn actuality, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t want to make Little Grey do anything like last time. Rather, it was because he remembered how much of an advantage Little Grey\u2019s sensitive nose was!However, an advantage could be turned into a disadvantage if abused. The Kobolds most likely had sensitive noses too, so Zhao Fu thought about how to make use of this. Zhao Fu took his soldiers back to the Great Qin Village so that they wouldn\u2019t inadvertently alert the Kobold Village.After returning to the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu gave the order for everyone to work on one thing: to collect chilis and then dry them over a stove before crushing them into powder. Zhao Fu and his soldiers prepared a few hundred kilograms of chili powder before confidently going back to the Kobold Village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone covered their noses and mouths with pieces of cloth to prevent themselves from being affected.In order to convince them to submit, Zhao Fu ordered his people to catch a Kobold. After forcing him to submit, he obtained the Kobold\u2019s language skills.Following this, the soldiers got into formation and marched towards the Kobold Village.Before they had even revealed themselves, the entire Kobold Village became alert because the Kobolds had already detected many enemies through their noses.A while later, Zhao Fu and his 900 soldiers reached the front of the Kobold Village, while all of the Kobolds were standing at the entrance with their weapons. The two sides faced off against each other.Zhao Fu did not do anything, and the Kobolds were too scared to make the first move. Zhao Fu had 900 soldiers while they barely had 1,000 Kobolds in total, so if Zhao Fu did attack, the Kobold Village would suffer countless casualties.\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill any of you. It is in your best interest to surrender; I will treat you as I treat my own people!\u201d Zhao Fu shouted while on top of Little Black.After shouting, Zhao Fu gestured for the Kobold by his side to translate.\u201cjicha owolo gulo\u2026\u201dThe Kobold loudly translated, after which what seemed to be the leader of the Kobolds stepped out and spoke for a long time. Zhao Fu could not understand him, so he looked at the Kobold beside him.The Kobold immediately translated, \u201cHe says, \u2018Humans, go back. We will not easily submit to anyone.\u2019\u201dZhao Fu\u2019s expression remained calm because he had expected this. He did not hold back anymore and gave the order to use the secret weapons as the Shieldbearers raised their shields and the Archers nocked their arrows.There was a small cloth pouch tied to each arrow. Of course, they were filled with chili powder, and the friction against the air would cause the chili powder to spill out.Swish, swish, swish\u2026Arrows flew through the air and left behind red trails behind them as they flew towards the Kobolds. The arrows did not hit any Kobolds, and they instead flew high above their heads, causing the red powder to descend on them.The leader of the Kobolds was about to order the Kobold Spearwielders to attack, but in the next second, he breathed in some chili powder, causing a fiery pain to erupt in his nose. All of the Kobolds desperately coughed as tears began to flow out of their eyes.Even normal people would have been completely overwhelmed if they had breathed in so much chili powder, so Zhao Fu had ordered all of his soldiers to cover their noses and mouths. In fact, Zhao Fu did not even bring Little Grey this time. One could only imagine how much pain the Kobolds were feeling.Zhao Fu did not stop, and he once again gave the order for the chili powder arrows to be fired towards the Kobold Village. The chili powder once again descended from the air, making it seem as if there was a red mist around the Kobolds.Within the Kobold Village, no one could remain standing. They all covered their noses and howled on the ground, tears streaming down their faces as if they had been affected by a biological weapon. Then again, chili powder was like a biological weapon to the Kobolds.A trace of a smile appeared on Zhao Fu\u2019s face as he gave the order to capture the Kobolds, who couldn\u2019t resist him at all now.In the end, Bai Qi and Zhang Dahu brought the Kobold leader to Zhao Fu. After pouring a few buckets of cold water on his head, he was able to somewhat recover, and he hatefully glared at Zhao Fu as he rapidly barked in his language.Zhao Fu was currently riding on Little Black and was looking down at the Kobold leader. He couldn\u2019t understand what the Kobold leader was saying, so he looked at the Kobold beside him.The Kobold translated somewhat fearfully, \u201cLord! The leader says that you\u2019re too despicable and that you don\u2019t dare to fight with them directly, which was why you used such a shameless tactic. He feels embarrassed for you.\u201dZhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but smile.Even though no one else could understand what the Kobold leader was saying, everyone could tell that it was cursing at Zhao Fu. Liu Mei, who enjoyed abusing others, rode her horse over and said to Zhao Fu, \u201cYour Majesty! I\u2019ll teach him a lesson for you.\u201dIn response, Zhao Fu nodded before riding Little Black towards the Kobold Village.Liu Mei grinned and slowly took out her whip as she looked at the Kobold leader.[Kobold Warrior]: F grade Military. Description: Warriors among the Kobolds. Effect: Receives [Kobold Saber Technique].[Kobold Spearwielder]: F+ grade Military. Description: Spearwielders among the Kobolds. Effect: Receives [Spear Throw].What surprised Zhao Fu was that the Spearwielder profession wasn\u2019t a special military profession, and there was no limit to how many people who could have this profession.After looking at the Barracks, Zhao Fu went to have a look at the other places and did not find much. However, the Kobold leader could not take Liu Mei\u2019s abuse anymore and chose to surrender to Zhao Fu.\u201cSystem announcement! Doke Village has surrendered to you. Would you like to accept?\u201dZhao Fu chose to accept before walking to the Village Hall. He chose to conquer the village and received 100 Achievement Points. Now, Zhao Fu had risen from Citizen to Esquire. He needed 1,000 Achievement Points to go from Esquire to Third-Ranked Baron.Zhao Fu then looked at the Kobold Village\u2019s stats:Village Name: Doke Village (Blue)Level: Intermediate (400/30,000)Village Area: 3 square kilometers.Village Territory: 15 square kilometers.Residents: 1002/2040Military: 618/618Popular Support: 78Village Special Stats: Territory Crop Output +8%, Territory Crop Growing Time -8%, Population Limit +2%, Military Limit +2%.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSubsidiary Village Limit: 2In terms of stats, it was much better than a Normal Village\u2019s, but it could not compare to the Great Qin Village. Zhao Fu decided to [Relocate] it and received 540 EXP (Because it took 5,000 EXP to level up from Primary to Intermediate level village, Zhao Fu received 540 EXP as opposed to 40 EXP).This time, he obtained more than 1,000 pieces of Normal equipment and 8,000 or so copper coins. The most important thing, however, was the 1,000 or so villagers that he had gained.Now that these 1,000 Kobolds had joined him, the Great Qin Village had the strength to start protecting itself against the 5,000 Orcs \u2013 that was the key thing. Out of the 1,000 Kobolds, Zhao Fu picked 500 Kobolds for his army: 300 Kobold Warriors and 200 Kobold Spearwielders.Now, the Great Qin Village\u2019s military numbered 1,400, and it had once again become much more powerful. This was Zhao Fu\u2019s new strategy. Even if it took more time, he wanted to gain as many villagers as possible. What every power always lacked was people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Fu looked at his stats and found that he was S grade and used sabers. Zhao Fu greatly lacked those who used sabers, so he directly gave Doke one of the Silver grade sabers.Because Doke had been severely abused by Liu Mei, he was a little traumatized. Every time he met Liu Mei, he actively avoided her. Zhao Fu had no idea what Liu Mei had done, but when he returned, he saw Doke covered with wounds and on his final breath.Now, the Great Qin Village\u2019s main task was to continue exploring!Bringing along Little Grey was something that was now essential to Zhao Fu. With its nose, he could find other Outlanders and animals much faster.Little Grey led the way as it sniffed around, and Zhao Fu followed behind it while riding on Little Black. Suddenly, Little Grey discovered something. It raised its head with a serious expression on its face as it looked ahead before turning around and calling out a few times to Zhao Fu. This meant that there was some sort of powerful creature ahead.Zhao Fu nodded and told everyone to be careful.Roar!!!!As everyone advanced, a massive tiger roared. A ferocious tiger the size of a cow walked out. The tiger\u2019s fur was snow-white without any blemishes, and it gave off a cold aura.[Iceborn Tiger]: Ice-type Chief class creature.Zhao Fu immediately gave the order to attack when he saw the tiger. Arrows started to fly towards it, but in the next second, an ice wall appeared in front of the Iceborn Tiger, blocking most of the arrows. However, a few of the arrows from the soldiers with Refined Martial Souls were able to pierce through the ice wall, though the Iceborn Tiger was able to easily evade them by the time they arrived on the other side.When the Iceborn Tiger saw so many people, even though it wasn\u2019t weak, it wasn\u2019t stupid and knew that it would lose, so it chose to run.Zhao Fu immediately gave the order for the Kobold Spearwielders to attack.In order to increase the strength of the Spearwielders, Zhao Fu prepared 10 iron javelins for each Spearwielder and gave them a bag to carry them on their backs. This was so that they would still have a weapon if they threw their weapon and was not able to retrieve it in time.The might of 200 javelins at once was simply terrifying. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The air was torn as the javelins rained down towards the Iceborn Tiger.Facing so many javelins, the Iceborn Tiger immediately summoned another ice wall. However, the ice wall simply could not stand up against so many javelins, and the Iceborn Tiger was still hit by 7 or 8 javelins.Because the Iceborn Tiger was a Chief class creature, it had powerful defenses and only the heads of the javelins pierced into its body, and they were not able to deal fatal damage to it.In its immense pain, the Iceborn Tiger lost its rationality and leapt at Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers, opening its massive mouth.Roar!!!!!The Iceborn Tiger roared as washbowl-sized ice bullets shot towards Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers. The Shieldbearers immediately raised their shields and stepped forwards.Bang!Massive explosions sounded out as the ice bullets smashed onto the shields and exploded, sending the Shieldbearers back by one step. Frost also started to cover their shields.Zhao Fu\u2019s expression did not change as he ordered his Archers to attack. The Iceborn Tiger rapidly dodged the arrows, but it was still hit by quite a few of them. Currently, the Iceborn Tiger\u2019s body was covered with arrows, but it still angrily charged over.Bai Qi, Zhang Dahu, Doke, Old Logue, and Liu Mei went forwards to meet it, launching their various skills.First was Old Logue\u2019s two blood-colored fireballs, which flew towards the Iceborn Tiger.The Iceborn Tiger dodged to the left, avoiding Old Logue\u2019s attack. However, in the next second, Liu Mei\u2019s Wind Blade flew at it from the direction that it had dodged in, hitting it and leaving a wound on its body.Roar!!!!!The Iceborn Tiger roared in pain.Following this, Zhang Dahu and Doke attacked from its right and left, and the Iceborn Tiger raised its paws to swipe at the two people. However, the two of them instead ran past it, not only dodging its paws but also leaving cuts on its sides.The Iceborn Tiger furiously turned to bite Doke when a ray of sword light suddenly flashed and massive amounts of blood spurted out \u2013 Bai Qi had slashed its throat with a single strike.Zhao Fu did not do anything the entire time as he sat on Little Black, and he did not take a single step. He calmly watched his subordinates attack the Iceborn Tiger. After all, that was the role of a Lord: to sit at the back and look calm while watching his or her subordinates get rid of enemies.\u201cSystem announcement! Your General has killed a Chief class magic beast, Iceborn Tiger, and has gained 27 Achievement Points.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! You have gained 23 Achievement Points.\u201dAfter the Iceborn Tiger died, it dropped 100 or so silver coins and 3 items.The first item was a cube that shined with blue light \u2013 Zhao Fu knew that this could be used to create a village. In actuality, Elite magic beasts could drop White grade City Creation Stones; Chief class magic beasts could drop Blue grade City Creation Stones; and Lord grade magic beasts had a chance of dropping Silver grade City Creation Stones.The City Creation Stones obtained from killing magic beasts were not restricted to any race. The race of the villagers that spawned from it was determined by the user\u2019s race.Zhao Fu put the City Creation Stone away and looked at the orb of light in front of him that gave off a chilling aura \u2013 this was similar to something Zhao Fu had seen before.[Innate Elemental Orb]: Description: After using the orb, one will obtain the D grade skill Ice Explosion Bullet.Ice Explosion Bullet was most likely the skill that the Iceborn Tiger had used just then. Zhao Fu thought about it, and his main subordinates who did not have Magic skills were Bai Qi, Zhang Dahu, and Doke. Because Bai Qi solely focused on using his sword, Zhao Fu decided to give the Innate Elemental Orb to Zhang Dahu.After receiving the orb, Zhang Dahu happily thanked Zhao Fu deeply and used it, making Doke, who had just joined Zhao Fu, to feel quite a bit of admiration.The third item was something that Zhao Fu did not recognize. It was an unevenly-shaped stone that gave off traces of chilling aura.[Ice Strengthening Stone]: Description: An Ice-type Strengthening Stone that can strengthen all equipment and give Ice-type damage bonuses or Ice-type defense bonuses.After looking at this information, Zhao Fu said, \u201cBai Qi! Give me your sword for a minute.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBai Qi did not hesitate at all when giving his Gold grade Star Slashing Sword to Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu took the Star Slashing Sword and placed the Strengthening Stone against it and chose to use it. The Strengthening Stone turned into a cold mist that surrounded the Star Slashing Sword before slowly merging into it.The Star Slashing Sword now seemed to have a layer of frost on it, and it had an icy feeling when held in one\u2019s hand.Zhao Fu looked at the Star Slashing Sword\u2019s stats:[Ice \u2013 Star Slashing Sword]: Grade: Half-Legendary (Incomplete), Stats: Strength +10, Constitution +6, Agility +4. Description: A Half-Legendary grade weapon that has become rusty due to the passage of time, becoming an ordinary Gold grade weapon.

The Strengthening Stone increased each of the three stats by two points and added bonus Ice damage. What\u2019s more, it brought the Star Slashing Sword back to its original grade.Strengthening Stones had excellent effects, but they were quite rare. It reminded Zhao Fu of the Soldier Souls, which also strengthened equipment. He did not know what sorts of effects they had, and just thinking about it made Zhao Fu quite excited.However, after remembering that General Armaments required 100 Soldier Souls, Zhao Fu could only forget about it for now. If Soldier Souls had similar effects to Strengthening Stones, then 100 Soldier Souls combined together would have monstrous effects. Even though it seemed quite far away, Zhao Fu was greatly looking forwards to having a General Armament someday.Right now, Li Wen was exploring the passages with some other soldiers and had collected 47 Soldier Souls over the past few days, so the day that Zhao Fu would obtain a General Armament was quickly approaching.After giving the Star Slashing Sword back to Bai Qi, Bai Qi looked at its new stats and felt quite ecstatic.The Iceborn Tiger\u2019s body had all sorts of valuable materials, so Zhao Fu ordered his soldiers to take care of its corpse. After all, most of these materials could be used to create Silver grade equipment. By looking at the position of the sun, Zhao Fu was able to determine that it was lunch time, so he decided that it would be best to eat the Iceborn Tiger\u2019s meat.They rested and prepared the Iceborn Tiger\u2019s meat by splitting it into chunks and roasting it. Zhao Fu ate a piece of the meat and felt that it was quite tasty and chewy, and he even obtained a system announcement telling him that he had received +1% Ice Resistance.Who would have thought that the meat would be so good? It was a pity that there was only enough of it for 100 or so people, so many people couldn\u2019t taste it.Afterwards, they continued exploring. After eating a few pieces of the Iceborn Tiger\u2019s meat, Little Grey worked harder and led the way as it sniffed around. Little Black liked to eat grass, so it was not given any of the Iceborn Tiger\u2019s meat, making it feel slightly unhappy. However, after being appeased by a Little Spirit Pill, its mood became better and it lightly walked behind Little Grey.\u201cAwoo\u2026\u201dLittle Grey seemed to smell something and howled before running and stopping near a Gnome Village.The village was a Primary Village and only had 300 or so Gnomes. There were 2 types of military units: Gnome Crossbowmen and Gnome Warriors, who used scimitars. The Gnome Warriors had fairly weak fighting power, and they were much weaker than the Goblin Warriors.Zhao Fu didn\u2019t bother with special tactics when facing the 300 Gnomes. He now had 1,400 soldiers, and they could completely suppress the other side. As such, he took his soldiers and tightly surrounded the Gnome Village before telling his Gnomes to ask the Gnome Village to surrender.What surprised Zhao Fu was that the Gnome Village wasn\u2019t willing to surrender and wanted to fight to the death despite seeing Zhao Fu\u2019s numbers. Zhao Fu was not in a hurry, and he prioritized gaining as many villagers as possible. As such, he ordered his soldiers to cut down trees and to build a simple barrier around the Gnome Village like they were creating a dumpling.When the Gnomes saw that Zhao Fu was building a barrier outside, they understood what Zhao Fu was doing and started to panic. There seemed to be quite a lot of chaos and dissension as a result.Zhao Fu observed everything in the village and understood that the Gnome Village had split into factions. One faction wanted to surrender because it understood that it was impossible to fight against Zhao Fu\u2019s forces. Moreover, they saw that there were many Gnomes in Zhao Fu\u2019s army, making it unlikely that they would be killed after surrendering, so they wisely wanted to surrender.However, the other side was stubborn and refused to surrender because those Gnomes wanted to die with the village.At this moment, Zhao Fu gave another order. He told the Archers to light up fire arrows. By now, the Gnomes knew that they would be burnt to death if they didn\u2019t make a decision.A large group of Gnomes walked out from the village and knelt on the ground, indicating their surrender.Zhao Fu nodded to show that he accepted and looked at the 50 or so Gnomes who were still in the village that refused to surrender. Zhao Fu changed his mind and ordered the Archers to aim for the Gnomes who refused to surrender instead of the buildings.Of course, Zhao Fu would not kill all of them \u2013 he just wanted to send a warning that he would not act softly against their stubbornness. He didn\u2019t believe that those Gnomes truly did not fear death and wanted to die with their village.\u201cFire!\u201dZhao Fu gave the order and the arrows flew towards the Gnomes. The Gnomes desperately fought back by shooting with their crossbows, but the crossbow bolts were completely blocked by the Shieldbearers. Zhao Fu\u2019s Archers\u2019 arrows contained immense strength, and they instantly pierced 10 or so of the Gnomes.After seeing those that they had just been speaking to suddenly shot to death, the aura of death quickly spread around the other Gnomes. Facing true death, the remaining Gnomes became terrified, and when Zhao Fu was about to order the second wave of Archers to fire, the remaining Gnomes cried as they ran out of the village and knelt on the ground, choosing to surrender.Zhao Fu accepted their surrender \u2013 this time, he had gained 301 Gnomes. Following this, Zhao Fu went to the Barracks and had a look at the Profession Change Stone Stele for Gnome Warriors.[Gnome Warrior]: F grade Military. Description: Warriors among Gnomes. Effect: Receives [Scimitar Control].It was an ordinary trash profession, and Zhao Fu did not take much interest in it. He went to the Village Hall and chose to conquer and [Relocate] the Village, earning him 50 Achievement Points and the Great Qin Village 169 EXP.After conquering this Village, Zhao Fu wanted to take everyone back to the Great Qin Village. However, they soon found a bandit villageRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe bandit village had roughly 400 bandits, and after the bandit leader left the village to hunt, Zhao Fu took advantage of the situation by attacking the village. After receiving a notification that the village was under attack, the bandit leader hurried back, but he was ambushed and killed by the soldiers that Zhao Fu had waiting for him.This time, Zhao Fu obtained 340 bandits, all of whom he placed in the army. However, because of a thread he had read on the forum, he decided to closely monitor them.Most of the villagers that spawned in bandit villages were men, and all of them had decent fighting strength, as opposed to ordinary villages which also spawned elderly, women, and children.Someone had wanted to use bandit villages to quickly spawn men for his or her army, so the person took over two bandit villages. He or she did not turn the bandit villages into ordinary villages afterwards, allowing the bandit villages to continue spawning bandits. However, once more than half of the person\u2019s army comprised of bandits, they immediately rebelled.Even though ordinary villages would spawn all sorts of villagers, they would be absolutely loyal to their Lord. As long as one did not oppress them or force them into dire straits, they would always remain loyal. However, bandits were different. If one did not manage them rigorously and keep their collective Loyalty above 60, it was possible for them to rebel. If someone had more bandits than loyal soldiers, it would be extremely dangerous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After returning to the Great Qin Village, he re-established the Gnome Village and the bandit village.He then went west of the Great Qin Village, took out a blue cube, and pressed it against the ground. Following this, blue light rippled out as a system announcement sounded, \u201cSystem announcement! Would you like to use this City Creation Stone?\u201dZhao Fu replied, \u201cYes!\u201dThe hazy images of a few structures appeared and gradually solidified as another system announcement sounded out, \u201cPlease give this village a name!\u201dZhao Fu thought about it and decided that since this village was established west of the Great Qin Village, it would be called Westwood Village.After naming the village, four figures slowly appeared. One was a white-bearded elder and the other three people were the Blacksmith, Apothecary, and Tailor. The white-bearded elder was B grade while the other 3 were C grade. Following this, Zhao Fu brought over 10 or so people from the Great Qin Village to build some basic buildings for the Westwood Village.Zhao Fu then went to the space of bones and placed the bandit leader\u2019s corpse on the altar. He activated the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation and obtained an S grade Orb. By now, they had used around 1% of the remaining energy stored in the energy stones and would be able to refine about another 100 corpses or so.As for who Zhao Fu would give this S grade Orb to, he had long since made the decision: Li Wen. Zhao Fu felt guilty towards him because he had voluntarily taken the Skeleton General profession and had been sent into the darkness every day to explore the passages.\u201cLi Wen, here!\u201dZhao Fu called Li Wen over and personally handed him the orb.Li Wen knelt on one knee and looking incredibly excited and moved that Zhao Fu would think of him first. He thanked Zhao Fu profusely before choosing to use the orb.The Grade Orb shined with a slightly blood-colored light and floated to Li Wen\u2019s head. It slowly enlarged until it became a bubble that surrounded Li Wen\u2019s entire body. Within the bubble, Li Wen tightly closed his eyes as if there were intense changes happening, and after a while, the bubble disappeared and Li Wen\u2019s grade rose to S grade.After he saw Li Wen\u2019s grade rise, Zhao Fu went back to the surface.Now, Zhao Fu had conquered 11 villages. There were 6 Human Villages, 3 Goblin Villages, and 2 Gnome Villages, and he now had 1,800 soldiers in total.Now that he had such a large army, Zhao Fu thought about launching some attacks against the Orc Village 100 kilometers away. Of course, Zhao Fu would not be so stupid as to reveal his own villages; rather, he wanted to see the Orc Village\u2019s true strength. Compared to living in fear of a possible Orc attacking every day, it was better for them to take an active role.Zhao Fu once again gathered his army when a Gnome Mechanics Scholar ran over and said something to him. A look of delight appeared on Zhao Fu\u2019s face and he decided not to set out for now. Instead, he decided to remain in the Great Qin Village for another few days. During this time, he gave the soldiers to Bai Qi to do some training.A few days later, Zhao Fu once again gathered his forces and brought some food, preparing to move out.Suddenly, Zhao Fu\u2019s body trembled as a system announcement sounded out in his mind.\u201cYou have received an oracle message!\u201dA strange look appeared on Zhao Fu\u2019s face; he had almost forgotten about his Demon Priest profession. The so-called oracle message was most likely from the \u2018god Kerr\u2019.Zhao Fu looked at the oracle message and saw that it wanted him to develop the number of believers and make a sacrifice.After looking at the oracle message\u2019s contents, Zhao Fu slightly frowned. He could make a sacrifice, but he wasn\u2019t willing to make his villagers believe in a god to increase Kerr\u2019s believers. After all, Zhao Fu did not believe in any gods \u2013 he believed that man could conquer nature.Suddenly, he remembered that the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation\u2019s description said that it could \u2018refine anything.\u2019 Zhao Fu mumbled to himself, \u201cThen\u2026 can it refine godly spirits?\u201dAfter this thought appeared in his mind, Zhao Fu started to feel quite excited. Plans rapidly formed in his mind and he had a feeling that it was possible for them to succeed.The god Kerr didn\u2019t know that Zhao Fu was starting to have wicked thoughts about it, and of course, Zhao Fu wouldn\u2019t directly go and kill a god. First off, he did not have the power to cross the plane of existence, and even if he could, he and his soldiers would be instantly killed. Even though that god Kerr was a weak godly spirit, it was still a godly spirit, and it definitely wasn\u2019t something that Zhao Fu could fight against.Zhao Fu understood all of this clearly, but he had a crazy idea. However, he wouldn\u2019t think about it for now \u2013 it was best to deal with the Orc Village first.Finally, Zhao Fu and his soldiers set off.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The sky was overcast, making the lighting quite dim, and the wind that blew through the trees was quite chilling. Zhao Fu and his soldiers had traveled for a few days and had traveled 100 kilometers away from the Great Qin Village. Because there were a few Grey Dwarves leading the way, Zhao Fu and his soldiers found the Orc Village quite quickly.The Orc Village was situated at the bottom of a mountain, and there were definitely more than 5,000 Orcs. There were 1,000 or so elderly, women, and children, and the remaining 4,000 were Orc warriors. The Orcs were all incredibly tall and muscular, and they had grey-white skin. Their faces were terrifying, wore beast skins, and normally held hatchets or maces.Zhao Fu knew that his side would definitely not be able to win if he launched a direct attack when facing so many Orcs. The Orcs had incredibly powerful bodies, and ordinary people would have a hard time fighting against them. However, Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers had various professions and profession bonuses, so things would be slightly better for them.If it was just Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers, it would be quite difficult for them to defeat the Orc Village, so Zhao Fu fell into deep thought.Bai Qi said, \u201cYour Majesty! You should look to see if there are any other factions around here. After all, we\u2019re from over 100 kilometers away, so we should gain some information before creating battle tactics.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu nodded in response and understood that he was being too hurried. As such, he asked the Grey Dwarves to introduce him to the surrounding powers.After listening to the Grey Dwarves, Zhao Fu learned that there were three big factions in the surrounding 50-kilometer radius. One was 18 kilometers to the south, a Goblin Village with around 5,000 Goblins; another was 21 kilometers to the west, a Kobold Village with around 4,000 Kobolds; and the final one was 20 kilometers to the east, an Elf Village with around 3,000 Elves.After receiving this information, Zhao Fu\u2019s mind felt much clearer.In his mind, he had two choices. One was to ally with the three villages to defeat the Orc Village. With the Orcs\u2019 brutal and barbaric tendencies, the surrounding villages must have suffered at their hands, so it was quite possible that the alliance would succeed.The second method was to pit the three villages and the Orc Village against each other. That way, not only would he be able to destroy the Orc Village, but he would also be able to devour the other 3 villages without wasting his own forces.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123In order to accomplish the first method, Zhao Fu had to ally with the other three villages. He would have to make some sacrifices in order to convince the other three villages, and he would also have to bear the brunt of the Orc attacks. Otherwise, he would not be able to fully gain the support of the other three villages. In the end, he would bear the greatest losses.In fact, it was possible that they would betray him and stab him in the back if they did not believe that he could defeat the Orcs.The second method presented his own side with the greatest benefits and the smallest losses.Zhao Fu thought about it and decided to take the second option because it clearly had the greatest benefits. If the three villages were his allies, he would not be able to do such a thing, but right now, it was unclear if they would be his allies or enemies. As such, Zhao Fu did not hold back.Now, the question was how to go about executing this plan. The Orc Village was most likely not willing to attack the three villages because it knew that it would cost too much to take down the three villages. As such, Zhao Fu had to make them go crazy and attack the other 3 villages at all costs.What was key was how to make them do something completely crazy. Zhao Fu had Kobolds and Goblins. They could pretend to attack the Orcs and make them think that it was the Kobold Village and Goblin Village that had done it.However, they were too weak, and they could not cause the Orcs to go mad. Instead, it might even cause them to have doubts. The Orcs might even suspect why these villages had dared to attack them despite being so much weaker than them.Zhao Fu never looked down on anyone or anything, so he naturally did not look down on the Orcs. As such, he would not use such a method.He decided to hide for now and catch an Orc during the night to get some information out of it so that he could make a more precise plan.As the sky darkened, torches started to be lit in the Orc Village below, and it also started to drizzle.Bai Qi, Zhang Dahu, and a few others took this opportunity to catch one of the weaker Orcs.Within a large hole in a tree, Zhao Fu looked at the bound up Orc. After Zhao Fu ordered his soldiers to whip it a few times, it quickly surrendered.This Orc was weak and clearly nutritionally deficient, and it seemed to have lived a tough life in the Orc Village. It was most likely looked down upon and bullied most of the time.This often happened in Human Villages as well. Those who were strong would often bully those who were weaker than them. The law that the strong preyed on the weak existed in all cultures, and even humans, with their \u2018superior intellect,\u2019 acted in this way.Because its status was quite poor in the Orc Village, its Loyalty towards the village was quite low, so it gave in quite easily. If Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers had caught Orcs that were quite well-off, they might not have given in even if their skin was turned into a bloody pulp.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Zhao Fu asked the Orc.The weak Orc replied fearfully, \u201cSir, my name is Anlun.\u201dZhao Fu nodded in satisfaction and asked, \u201cI want to know everything about the Orc Village. If you know what\u2019s best for you, you will tell me.\u201dFollowing this, Orc Anlun obediently told Zhao Fu everything about the Orc Village.The Orc Village was called Odeis Village, and it was an Advanced Village. Its Chief was called Odeis, who was the most powerful Orc in the village. Odeis also had a little brother called Oka, who was also quite strong, and Oka was the second in command in the village.Zhao Fu quickly asked, \u201cHow is the relationship between the Chief and the second in command?\u201dAnlun replied, \u201cIt\u2019s quite good; the Chief cares about the second in command greatly.\u201dZhao Fu smiled \u2013 he now had a target. He continued to get information from Anlun about the Orc military and found out that there were two Orc military units:[Orc Warrior]: E- grade Military. Description: Powerful warriors among the Orcs. Effect: Receives [Barbaric Battle].[Strong Orc]: D grade Military. Description: Powerful warriors among the Orcs. Effect: Receives [Ancestor\u2019s Might].The second type was a special military profession, and because the village was an Advanced Village, the limit was 30 Orcs. Both of the Orc Chiefs were Strong Orcs.Zhao Fu asked about some other matters, and after receiving some satisfactory answers, he left the Orc under guard before discussing with Bai Qi and the others his strategy.The next day, Zhao Fu and his soldiers continued to observe the village from far away.At this moment, a 2-meter tall Orc with totems tattooed all over his body walked out with 100 or so Orcs. From the information he had obtained from Anlun, Zhao Fu knew that this Orc was the second in command, Oka.Zhao Fu was quite surprised that he only took 100 Orcs with him. However, since the Orcs were the overlords here and everyone would try to avoid them, they were most likely used to going around unhindered. How could they expect Zhao Fu, who should have been 100 kilometers away, to be right in front of them?Zhao Fu told his soldiers to lay an ambush and began the plan!\u201cSecond Chief, where are we going to hunt today?\u201dOka was leading his team forwards, and just as he was about to respond to the question\u2026Swish, swish, swish\u2026The sound of the air being torn sounded out as Oka looked over in surprise and roared, \u201cAmbush!!\u201dHowever, it was too late. Zhao Fu had 300 Archers, 200 Crossbowmen, and 200 Kobolds with javelins. How could the 100 or so Orcs evade these attacks?The Orcs were either shot to death by countless arrows and crossbow bolts or pierced by javelins and nailed to the ground. Blood spurted everywhere, and it was a total massacre.Oka was hit by many arrows, but he slashed away the javelins flying towards him with 2 saber strikes. Looking at the dead Orcs around him, he furiously roared, \u201cWho is it? Get out here!\u201dZhao Fu slowly brought his soldiers over and looked at the Orc Village\u2019s Second Chief, Oka.Oka was quite surprised when he saw that it was a human \u2013 when were there humans around here?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, Oka understood his situation and yelled, \u201cI\u2019m Odeis Village\u2019s Second Chief. Human, do you know just who you\u2019re going against?\u201dZhao Fu couldn\u2019t understand him, but after Anlun interpreted what he said, Zhao Fu lightly laughed.Suddenly, Oka turned into a black blur and rushed towards Zhao Fu. He was covered with arrows and heavily injured.He knew that his only hope was in capturing Zhao Fu, so he rushed over and tried to catch him unprepared.However, Oka had underestimated Zhao Fu. The instant he moved, countless arrows flew towards him, forcing him to quickly defend with his saber.Suddenly, a spear flew at him like a bolt of lightning, piercing Oka\u2019s chest. The Kobold Chief, Doke, had ended Oka\u2019s life with a single strike.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then told his soldiers to use spears or sabers to make it look like all of the wounds were caused by Kobolds.The most powerful of the 3 other villages was the Kobold Village, which had 4,000 Kobolds. Next was the Goblin Village. Even though it had 5,000 Goblins, its overall battle strength was far weaker. The weakest faction was most likely the Elf Village, which had 3,000 Elves.Since the Kobolds were the most powerful, Zhao Fu would bring disaster to them first.They continued executing the plan, and Doke took all of the Kobolds under Zhao Fu\u2019s command to drag the Orc corpses near the Orc Village before leaving a trail of Orc corpses towards the Kobold Village.Within the Orc Village.\u201cUrgent! I saw a lot of Kobolds dragging away Orc corpses west!!\u201d Some of the Orcs standing guard at the village entrance suddenly yelled as they ran into the village.Many of the Orcs who heard this did not initially believe it \u2013 why would the Kobolds dare to attack them? However, when some Orcs dragged back a few bloodied Orc corpses, all of the Orcs became completely enraged. When they saw the injuries on the corpses, they could only imagine how much they had suffered before dying.Countless Orcs ran to the Village Hall and loudly shouted that they wanted permission to destroy the Kobold Village.Within the Village Hall, an Orc that was more than 2 meters tall with totem tattoos also looked completely enraged. This was Chief Odeis. Right now, he had a terrible feeling because these corpses were all those who went with his little brother.Worried that something had happened to Oka, Odeis gathered most of the Orc warriors, leaving very few of them behind to defend the village, and headed west.They saw many wretched Orc corpses on the way, and all of the Orcs suppressed the flames of fury in their hearts as they quickly made their way to the Kobold Village.On the other side, the Kobold Village was the same as usual, and everyone went about their normal business. Everything seemed quite peaceful.At this moment, the Kobolds standing guard saw a few unfamiliar Kobolds dragging what looked like corpses to a large tree about 300 meters in front of the village.Because the approaching Kobolds swaggered forwards like they were completely confident in what they were doing, the guards thought that they were new Kobolds who had recently spawned, which was why they did not recognize them. They felt that their actions were quite strange, so they asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dDoke and his soldiers were about to hang up a body, and when he heard the Kobold guard\u2019s question, he cheerfully responded like they were friends, \u201cNothing much! We\u2019re just hanging something here.\u201dFollowing this, Doke changed the subject by loudly declaring, \u201cThe Kobold Village is the strongest one here; let\u2019s all be proud of our village!\u201dThe guards were quite confused by what Doke initially said, but after hearing him continue, they started to feel quite pleased. Who wouldn\u2019t feel happy when someone glorified their race?The guards shouted back, \u201cThat\u2019s right! The Kobold Village is the strongest! Orcs? Elves? Goblins? They\u2019re all trash! The Kobold Village will get rid of them sooner or later!\u201dBy now, Doke and his soldiers had hung up the Orc corpse, and when he heard what the guard said, he laughed and raised his hand as he shouted back, \u201cShout your praises to the Kobold Village! We\u2019ll definitely become the most powerful race and conquer all the other races. Kobolds forever!\u201dDoke lived up to his reputation as a former Chief of a Kobold Village. He was able to instantly make the atmosphere incredibly joyful and lively, and the Kobold guards\u2019 blood boiled as they raised their hands and shouted back, \u201cKobolds forever!\u201dAfter completing his task, Doke looked at the Kobold guards and cheerfully laughed as he said, \u201cThe Chief has given us other orders, so we\u2019ll be off now.\u201dThe guards enthusiastically yelled back, \u201cBrothers, we\u2019ll treat you to some wild boar meat when you come back!\u201dDoke and his Kobolds suppressed their laughter when they heard the Kobold guards call them brothers. These guards had no idea they had been played by Doke, and they called him their brother and wanted to treat him to wild boar meat.A while after Doke and his Kobolds had left, a faint breeze blew over and a guard wondered, \u201cWhy do I smell Orcs?\u201dThe other Kobolds also smelled it and looked ahead of them, almost forgetting something. They had thought that the Chief had ordered this corpse to be hung up, and no one paid much attention to it. However, they couldn\u2019t stop themselves from going over and having a look at the bloodied corpse, and when they saw it closer, they became so scared that their legs weakened. They recognized this Orc \u2013 it was the incredibly ferocious and evil Second Chief of the Orc Village.By now, Odeis and his Orc warriors had reached the Kobold Village. Even though he had hoped that his little brother would be fine, he felt as if his eyes were going to burst when he saw his brother\u2019s corpse hanging off the tree, and he shrieked, \u201cKill them all!!\u201dThe fury that the Orcs had suppressed this entire time suddenly exploded out. 4,000 or so Orc warriors rushed at the Kobold Village like a flood, causing the earth to tremble and birds to fly away in fear. The Kobolds quickly came out to defend against the Orc attack. Spears flew through the air, and because the Orcs knew exactly what they were going to be dealing with, they had come prepared.They all had wooden shields \u2013 or rather, wooden blocks \u2013 that they held in front of themselves.Bang! Bang! Bang!The spears contained immense force, and while some of them were stopped by the wooden shields, others pierced through the wooden shields, killing the Orcs behind them.However, the spears only killed a few Orcs, and the Orcs continued to charge forwards. The Orcs were incredibly ferocious as they rushed over, and when they brandished their hatchets and maces, the Orcs gave off an aura that made it seem as if they would destroy everything.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe 2 sides quickly clashed, and facing the Orcs\u2019 attacks, the Kobolds desperately defended.Zhao Fu coldly watched the battle in front of him. Lives disappeared in an instant, and blood stained the ground as the aura of death spread.\u201cPrepare to release the fire arrows,\u201d Zhao Fu ordered as his soldiers lit their arrows and shot them from behind the Kobold Village, lighting many buildings on fire and killing many Kobolds.Right now, Zhao Fu had to help the Orcs destroy the Kobold Village. He still needed the Orcs to destroy the other 2 villages, so he had to preserve at least a portion of the Orcs\u2019 strength.The Kobolds were facing the Orcs\u2019 savage attacks from the front, and they were now attacked by Zhao Fu\u2019s forces from the back. After being pincered, the situation quickly became ugly for them. When he heard that Orcs were attacking from the front and that Humans were attacking from behind, the Kobold Chief became incredibly furious and thought that the Orcs and Humans were shamelessly working together to destroy the Kobold Village. The Kobold Chief knew that they would definitely lose, so he went to the Village Hall and chose to [Relocate] the village before giving the City Heart and 100 warriors to a trusted aide. The aide was to escape with 200 elderly and children, while the Chief would fight to the death to buy some more time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He ordered his people to retreat, surprising the Kobold Chief. Now that they only had to defend against the Orcs, with most of the Kobolds defending, they were able to give the ones that were escaping some time to run away.Now, the Kobold Chief drew his large saber and personally went to fight with the Orc Chief, Odeis.\u201cWhy did you ally with humans and attack the Kobold Village?\u201d The Kobold Chief furiously roared as he slashed Odeis.\u201cWhy did you kill my little brother?\u201d Odeis roared as he hatefully glared at the Kobold Chief.It was a pity that they could only speak their respective languages. Neither of them could understand each other, and the only thing they saw was an enemy that they had to kill. The thought that someone had orchestrated all of this never came to their minds.Zhao Fu also noticed the escaping Kobolds and turned to look at the Kobold Chief, who was fighting a bloody battle. He was willing to sacrifice himself so that some of the other Kobolds could escape.All the escaping Kobolds watched their Chief desperately fight on the battlefield as tears streamed down their faces. His body seemed to be glowing with light, making him look incredibly heroic.Zhao Fu saw that the Kobold Chief had been injured many times by Odeis\u2019s hatchet and was covered in blood. And yet, he was still fighting valiantly, though his movements were growing sluggish. It was clear how this would end.\u201cAi!\u201d Zhao Fu sighed. In these disturbed, chaotic, war-filled times, if Zhao Fu did not become powerful, his result would be like that of the Kobold Chief\u2019s or even worse. If he did not become powerful, his forces would be devoured by someone else\u2019s.Zhao Fu turned to look at the 300 or so escaping Kobolds and gave the order to capture them.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cHumans! Why will you not spare us?\u201dBy now, 900 of Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers had surrounded the 300 Kobolds, and the Kobold leading them angrily yelled at Zhao Fu.\u201cI want you to surrender to me. As long as you surrender, I promise that I won\u2019t harm any of you,\u201d Zhao Fu said as Doke interpreted.\u201cHaha! You and the Orcs attacked our village together and killed so many of our people, yet you want us to surrender to you?\u201d The Kobold mocked as he coldly laughed.Zhao Fu remained expressionless as he coldly replied, \u201cFirst, I didn\u2019t collaborate with the Orcs. Second, if I didn\u2019t reduce you to this state, would you have agreed to surrender to me? Third, I\u2019m not negotiating with you; if you want to die, I\u2019ll fulfill your wish!\u201dAll of the Archers and Crossbowmen raised their weapons. As soon as Zhao Fu gave the order, they would fire at the Kobolds.The expression of the leading Kobold became ugly. He thought back to how the Chief had entrusted everyone\u2019s lives to him, and he hesitated before choosing to surrender.Now, the main battlefield was split into 3!Since the escaping Kobolds were taken care of, Zhao Fu went back to the Kobold Village. There was only a small team of Kobolds desperately fighting back, and in the end, all of them were killed. This, of course, included the Kobold Chief. The Orcs had come to seek vengeance, and they normally didn\u2019t take prisoners anyways.All the Kobolds, except for the ones that had surrendered to Zhao Fu, had died. Around 1,000 of the 4,000 Orcs had died, and most of the surviving Orcs had been wounded.Odeis wanted to chase down the 300 Kobolds that escaped, but after massacring the entire village, he decided that he had taken revenge for his little brother. When he saw how exhausted his subordinates were and thought about how far the Kobolds would have run away by now, he decided to give up.Suddenly, a few Orcs reported that they had seen humans, although there were very few of them.Even though Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers had been stealthy, there were still seen by a few Orcs. Luckily, Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers had split up, so the Orcs had only seen 10 or so humans.After listening to their reports, Odeis did not give much mind to those 10 or so humans. It was possible that a Human Village nearby had been attacked by the Kobolds, and they could be slaves that the Kobolds had captured\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.While all of this was happening, Bai Qi took 900 soldiers to attack the Orc Village while most of the Orcs were attacking the Kobold Village.Old Logue and his Goblins attacked from the front while Bai Qi and his soldiers stealthily killed some elderly and young Orcs.Zhao Fu had to admit that these methods were quite vicious, but if he had to choose between the elderly and young Orcs and his people, he would choose the Orcs to die.Bai Qi\u2019s job was to make it look like the Goblin Village had attacked the Orc Village, and since many elderly and young Orcs were killed, it was as if the village had become hell. In order to infuriate the Orcs even more, he even torched some of the buildings.After doing all of this, Bai Qi ordered the Goblins to leave clues that this was done by the Goblin Village to the south.After the 3,000 Orcs returned from destroying the Kobold Village, even though they had taken revenge, their hearts still felt quite heavy. After all, they had lost nearly 1,000 Orcs.However, what they never expected was that they would see many elderly and young Orcs lying in pools of blood when they returned. Their fury shot to the sky when they saw their family and friends\u2019 corpses on the ground.The remaining Orcs sorrowfully cried out that this was done by the Goblins from the south. Because only the Goblins had shown themselves while everyone else hid and killed Orcs, most of the remaining Orcs only saw Goblins attacking them, and the remaining Orcs saw them leaving southwards. Naturally, they would think that they were from the Goblin Village in the south.All the Orc warriors once again picked up their weapons, disregarding their weariness. They marched towards the Goblin Village in the south filled with killing intent.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNearby, Zhao Fu and Bai Qi had regrouped, and they started leading their forces towards the Elf Village in the east.A while later, Zhao Fu, riding on Little Black, went to the front of the Elf Village with 500 soldiers. Because his goal was to lure the Elves out, he did not bring many soldiers with him.When Zhao Fu saw the Elves, he found that they were just as the stories had said. No matter if it was a male or a female, all the elves were incredibly good-looking and had pointed ears, snow-white skin, and delicate features.Zhao Fu lead his soldiers over to the Elf Village in an aggressive manner, and this caused the Elf Village to become quite wary. The Elf Village\u2019s defenses were decent, and apart from wooden barriers, they also had a few sentry towers.What Zhao Fu did not expect, however, was that the Elf Village\u2019s Chief would be an extremely beautiful female Elf. She looked like she was in her early thirties, and her golden hair reached her waist. She also wore a set of leather armor that revealed her mature curves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Fu was not easily allured by beauty, and of course, he would not have his soldiers actually attack the Elf Village with their full might. Rather, he ordered his Archers to attack in order to act as if he wanted to take down the Elf Village.Facing Zhao Fu\u2019s provocation, since he only had a few hundred soldiers, the Elf Village quickly responded. 2,000 Elves rushed out of the village, and when Zhao Fu saw this, he immediately chose to run.The Elves didn\u2019t want to chase after him. After all, the Elves were not a race that loved to fight, but when they started to retreat to their village, Zhao Fu once again came to provoke them. By the third time this happened, no matter how well-tempered the Elves were, they couldn\u2019t stop themselves from becoming furious, and they started to angrily chase Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers.However, after chasing for a while, though Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers had disappeared, the Elves heard fighting from nearby. They looked over and saw that the Orcs were fighting with the Goblins.The Elf Chief immediately realized something, and a look of shock appeared on her beautiful face as she yelled, \u201cHurry and leave!\u201dHowever, it was too late. When the Orcs saw so many Elves rush over in such a bloodthirsty manner, they thought that the Elves were here to help the Goblins, so some of the Orcs started to rush towards the Elves.The Goblins, on the other hand, thought that the Elves were here to help the Orcs destroy them, so they also started to attack the Elves.By now, it was too late for the Elves to run away even if they wanted to. They could only retaliate at the Orcs and Goblins rushing at them, and a chaotic three-way battle ensued.Zhao Fu and his subordinates coldly watched the battle unfold, waiting to be the fisherman that caught the sandpiper and clam after they fought.Each side steadily lost people, and blood and corpses covered the ground. After the massive, chaotic battle, there were only 300 out of the 3,000 Orcs left, 400 out of the 2,000 Elves left, and 700 out of the 5,000 Goblins left.Zhao Fu saw that the time was ripe. He and his forces revealed themselves and formed a massive encirclement that surrounded the 3 factions.Right now, Zhao Fu did not fear them at all. Combined, they had less than 1,400 soldiers, and all of them were wounded and exhausted from the taxing battle. The Orcs were in the worst state after going through two big battles.When they saw that the enemy surrounding them included Goblins, Gnomes, Kobolds, and Humans, the surrounded Elves, Orcs, and Goblins were stunned. They all stopped fighting and warily looked at the people surrounding them.Of course, the Elves were the clearest about what was going on because they knew it was Zhao Fu who had lured them into this massive battle, resulting in the present situation. The Elf Chief furiously looked at Zhao Fu and called out, \u201cYou shameless humans!\u201dThe Goblins were the most confused. Why did the Orcs suddenly madly attack them? Why did the Elves suddenly join in? Why were they now surrounded by Humans for no reason?The Orcs, on the other hand, were the most furious. When they saw Zhao Fu\u2019s appearance, they understood everything: why the Kobolds had dared to kill the Second Chief and why the Goblins would attack their village \u2013 the one behind all of this was the human in front of them.All of the Orcs roared and furiously charged at Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu calmly watched the Orcs rush at him and turned to signal at Bai Qi. Bai Qi loudly shouted, and 20 ballistae, which gave off terrifying auras, were wheeled out.Back then, when Zhao Fu was about to set off, the Gnome Mechanics Scholars came to inform Zhao Fu that they had successfully researched the ballista. Zhao Fu ordered the Gnomes to start researching the ballista the day he had conquered his first Gnome Village, and they had finally succeeded. That was why Zhao Fu waited a few days before leaving the village.Ballistae were quite difficult to create, so even though Zhao Fu had poured all his resources during those days into creating ballistae, they were only able to create 20 of them.Now, it was time to test the might of the ballistae. Each one of them could shoot 3 bolts at a time, and each bolt was 1 finger-length wide and 1.4 meters long. When the 300 Orcs rushed at them, the soldiers readied the ballistae and took aim.\u201cFire!\u201dAs Bai Qi gave the order, the soldiers operating the ballistae started to release the bolts.Swish, swish, swish\u2026The bolts tore through the air, and they traveled incredibly quickly, making them look like dark rays of light that could only be seen for an instant.Chi, chi, chi\u2026The Orcs were already completely exhausted, and they were using the last of their strength to charge towards Zhao Fu\u2019s forces. The bolts pierced through Orc after Orc, and some even stabbed into the Orcs behind them, turning them into skewers as blood erupted from their chests.In just an instant, 70 or so Orcs had suddenly died. The might of the ballistae caused the Orcs that were running and shouting to stop in their tracks.Odeis, who was leading the charge, was hit in the abdomen by a bolt, and the massive impact almost destroyed all his organs. He half-knelt on the ground and vomited up blood as he hatefully glared at Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu calmly took out a bow and slowly drew it, aiming at Odeis\u2019s chest. Zhao Fu did not want to do this \u2013 if possible, he wanted to live in a peaceful world where he didn\u2019t have to fight, kill, plot, or do things that he didn\u2019t want to do.However, right now, the world was extremely chaotic. If he did not become powerful, his end would be like Odeis\u2019s \u2013 after all, this world was one that belonged to the strong; the weak simply could not survive.Facing Odeis\u2019s hateful eyes, Zhao Fu completely understood how he felt, and Zhao Fu did not feel angry at all. However, Zhao Fu still had to kill him.Zhao Fu released the arrow. Just like that, Odeis, the orc Chief who had dominated the surrounding 50 kilometers, died at his hands.Zhao Fu looked around and yelled, \u201cPut down your weapons and surrender or die!\u201dAs Zhao Fu yelled, Old Logue and Orc Anlun interpreted what Zhao Fu said.Those within the encirclement became completely frightened by the ballistae\u2019s might. After considering how many soldiers Zhao Fu had and the fact that they were completely surrounded, they knew that they simply could not win. As such, the Goblins were the first to surrender.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs for the remaining Orcs, a few of them were stubborn and willing to die rather than submit to Zhao Fu. They raised their weapons and charged at Zhao Fu, and they were quickly killed. As for the other Orcs, when they looked at their dead Chief again, they decided to surrender.Finally, after the Elf Chief looked at Odeis\u2019s half-kneeling corpse, a complicated look appeared in her eyes. The Orc Chief that had dominated this region and caused countless villages to tremble in fear had died at the hands of this human.The Elf Chief looked at Zhao Fu and thought about the elderly and young Elves in the village. She sighed and half-knelt on the ground with the other Elves.\u201cSystem Announcement! Daisy Village has surrendered to you. Would you like to accept?\u201dHearing this system announcement, Zhao Fu looked at the beautiful Elf Chief and chose to accept.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Fu stepped over corpse after corpse and went to the Goblin Village\u2019s Village Hall. Unsurprisingly, the Goblin Village was an Advanced Village and Blue grade.Zhao Fu chose to conquer it and [Relocate] it, and he received a system announcement telling him that he had obtained 200 Achievement Points and 4,340 EXP.Zhao Fu was quite happy that he had obtained so many Achievement Points and so much EXP all of a sudden \u2013 these were the benefits of conquering an Advanced Village. Right now, the Great Qin Village was only an Intermediate Village and required 30,000 EXP to level up to an Advanced Village. After receiving so much EXP, it was quite close to leveling up again.Because the Elf Village was quite close, Zhao Fu took his soldiers to the Elf Village. The Elves inside the village received system announcements that their Chief had surrendered, but they were still surprised to see so many Outlanders walk in: there were Kobolds, Goblins, Gnomes, and even the terrifying Orcs.As such, most of the Elves did not dare to approach, and they stood far away as they looked at them fearfully.Daisy brought Zhao Fu into the Elf Village and walked towards the Village Hall. At this moment, a 15 or 16-year-old Elf girl ran over and tugged at Daisy\u2019s arm before burying her head into Daisy\u2019s embrace. She asked nervously, \u201cMother, what\u2019s going on?\u201dDaisy looked at her daughter lovingly and stroked her head as she said softly, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later!\u201d Daisy then turned to Zhao Fu and introduced them, \u201cYour Majesty, this is my daughter, Asani.\u201dZhao Fu looked at Asani. She was also quite beautiful and had delicate features. She looked a lot like her mother, but she had an air of tenderness about her.Zhao Fu nodded, indicating that he understood.Following this, Daisy brought Zhao Fu into the Village Hall. Zhao Fu looked at the Elf Village\u2019s stats and found that it was also a Blue grade Advanced Village. Just as he was about to conquer and [Relocate] it, he suddenly thought of something and went to the Elf Barracks.[Elven Archer]: E- grade Military. Description: All Elves are proficient at archery and using swords. Effect: Receives [Bow and Sword Control].[Elven Priest]: D- grade Military. Description: A Priest among Elves. Effect: Receives [Power of Life].Zhao Fu was quite surprised when he saw a Profession Change Stone Stele for Elven Priest. After all, a Priest was a special profession, and one could only obtain that profession through a godly spirit. That was why Zhao Fu felt that this was quite strange.Afterwards, Zhao Fu asked Daisy about it. She explained that every Elf was a child of the great Goddess of Life, so all Elves could become a Priest through such means.Zhao Fu remembered that the most eye-catching profession in the chaotic three-way battle was the Strong Orc. When the Strong Orcs started to fight, their eyes became blood-shot and their muscles became incredibly taut. They became incredibly valiant and fearless, making anyone feel terrified when seeing them fight. Next were the Goblin Warriors, who brandished their short sabers as they took life after life.After them were the Elves holding wooden staffs. They could release a green light to heal the injured and could also use offensive magic \u2013 wooden spikes that were 1 meter long and would pierce the enemies.Those were most likely the Elven Priests. Just like Zhao Fu\u2019s Demon Priest profession, it was also a D- grade profession. However, Zhao Fu felt that the Elven Priest profession was better. After all, there could only be 100 Demon Priests at any point in time, while any Elf could use this Profession Change Stone Stele to be an Elven Priest. Moreover, the Demon Priest profession had a weak godly spirit while the Elven Priest profession had the great Goddess of Life as its godly spirit.After looking at this information, Zhao Fu went back to the Village Hall and chose to [Relocate] the village, resulting in him obtaining 200 Achievement Points and 3,650 EXP for the Great Qin Village.Finally, Zhao Fu went to the Orc Village. By now, there were less than 50 Orc warriors and 200 or so elderly and young Orcs left in the Orc Village.The Orcs wisely chose to surrender when they saw Zhao Fu\u2019s massive army, and Zhao Fu went straight to the Village Hall and looked at the village\u2019s stats. He was surprised to find that the Orc Village was a Silver grade Village.After choosing to conquer and [Relocate] the village, Zhao Fu received 200 Achievement Points and the Great Qin Village received more than 7,000 EXP. After conquering 3 Advanced Villages, Zhao Fu\u2019s total Achievement Points were now over 800, and the Great Qin Village had more than 26,000 EXP. Zhao Fu\u2019s status and the Great Qin Village\u2019s level were both close to increasing.Their greatest gains this time, however, was the population increase. There were 300 or so Kobolds, 700 or so Goblins, 400 or so Orcs, and 1,400 Elves. Because the Elves were the weakest faction and Zhao Fu had involved them last, they had the most people remaining.After taking care of all of this, Zhao Fu\u2019s 100-kilometer expedition came to a perfect conclusion. Not only did they rid themselves of the Orc threat, but they also gained 2,800 villagers, 1 Silver grade City Heart, and 3 Blue grade City Hearts.After a few days, Zhao Fu and his soldiers returned to the Great Qin Village. After settling in the new villagers, he took three rotting corpses to the altar at the region of bones. These three corpses belonged to the Kobold Chief and the two Orc Chiefs.Zhao Fu selected the option to refine them, and he obtained 3 Grade Orbs. He received 1 SS grade Orb, which had most likely come from Odeis, and 2 S grade Orbs.Zhao Fu was ecstatic when he saw that Odeis had been refined into an SS grade Orb. Zhao Fu remembered seeing a quest to kill Odeis at Holy Light City, and the rewards were quite good: an abundance of Merit Points and a Silver grade weapon. However, the requirement to complete the quest was to surrender Odeis\u2019s corpse or head.The Merit Points and Silver grade weapon simply could not compare to an SS grade Orb. Zhao Fu didn\u2019t try to be greedy by cutting off Odeis\u2019s head \u2013 he was worried that the corpse wouldn\u2019t be refined into a Grade Orb or that the Grade Orb would be incomplete if it was lacking anything important. If that were the case, it simply wouldn\u2019t be worth it for Zhao Fu.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs for the three Grade Orbs, Zhao Fu quickly decided who to give them to. After returning to the surface, Zhao Fu called Bai Shan to the Village Hall. Bai Shan was the Great Qin Village\u2019s first B grade villager and Scholar, and he was around 60 years old. At the same time, he was also the Captain of the Research Team, and now that the Great Qin Village was at Intermediate Level, the maximum number of Scholars had risen to 20.When Bai Shan heard that Zhao Fu had summoned him, Bai Shan thought that Zhao Fu was angry that he had not been able to research a skill that determined the grade of a corpse even after such a long period of time. As such, as soon as he arrived, he knelt on the ground, his face pale, and said, \u201cYour Majesty, please punish this subordinate for not being able to successfully research the skill after so long!\u201dZhao Fu was sitting on a chair and just about to raise his teacup. Zhao Fu paused in surprise when he heard what Bai Shan said, but Zhao Fu realized that it had indeed been quite a while since they had discovered the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation. However, this was not something that could be rushed, so Zhao Fu did not blame Bai Shan.\u201cYou may rise, Elder Bai,\u201d Zhao Fu said after sipping his tea.From Zhao Fu\u2019s tone, Bai Shan felt that Zhao Fu wasn\u2019t angry, and he quickly got to his feet. Following this, Zhao Fu handed him a blood-red orb.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had no idea what it was because the Grade Orbs were the Great Qin Village\u2019s greatest secret. Zhao Fu had strictly ordered everyone who knew about them not to divulge any information, so most people did not know about them.After Bai Shan took it, Zhao Fu explained to him what the Grade Orb did.Bai Shan looked completely stunned, and after recovering, tears started to stream down his face. He ran over and hugged Zhao Fu\u2019s legs as he emotionally cried out, \u201cYour Majesty! Your grace towards me is something I can never repay in this lifetime or in the next!\u201dThis was because Zhao Fu had given him an SS grade Orb. There were only 2 SS grade villagers in the entirety of the Great Qin Village: one was Li Si and the other was Zhang Dahu. Both were important subordinates to Zhao Fu \u2013 this was especially so for Li Si, who managed everything, great or small, in the Great Qin Village. It could be said that he was above 10,000 people and only below a single person.Now that Zhao Fu had given Bai Shan an SS grade Orb, Zhao Fu had essentially elevated Bai Shan to the same level as the others. How could Bai Shan not feel shocked or emotional after being raised from a normal citizen to an important minister?Zhao Fu helplessly looked at the old man hugging his legs, who had tears and snot all over his face, and said, \u201cAlright, please get up!\u201dZhao Fu gave Bai Shan the SS grade Orb after a lot of thinking. After all, anyone would want to be SS grade. People like Liu Mei, Old Logue, and Doke were all S grade, so Zhao Fu wanted to give them SSS grade Orbs in the future. As such, giving them an SS grade Orb right now was a bit of a waste, and S grade was not too bad. This was why Zhao Fu didn\u2019t choose them.Of course, Zhao Fu could have given the SS grade Orb to anyone and nurtured him or her into a great general, but Zhao Fu was not lacking subordinates and he still had the two S grade Orbs. As such, he put that thought aside.Moreover, when Zhao Fu thought of research, no matter if it were the teleportation channels or the Taming skill, he realized that Scholars were incredibly important. After all, science could greatly increase their productivity.Zhao Fu needed to develop both his military and villages. If he only focused on his military, he would only temporarily seem powerful, and he would soon start to lack resources. If he only focused on his villages, without a sufficient army, he would simply be fattening up his villages for someone else to take them.There were also the Gnome Mechanics Scholars. Zhao Fu decided that he would also give them Grade Orbs in the future. The ballistae that they had created were the Great Qin Village\u2019s most powerful weapons at the moment. However, ballistae were only effective against those who were at Stage 1 or below in their cultivation. They would not be as effective against those above Stage 1, so Zhao Fu ordered the Gnome Mechanics Scholars to research Stage 1 ballistae. These ballistae would be able to threaten those at Stage 1, and they would still be effective against those above Stage 1.Raising one\u2019s Grade meant that his or her comprehension and abilities would be enhanced. Through the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation, Zhao Fu\u2019s people were able to steal other people\u2019s fortune.Right now, ordinary ballistae were good enough, so Zhao Fu held off from giving the Gnome Mechanics Scholars the Grade Orbs for now.Zhao Fu told Bai Shan to go back and continue researching a skill that could let them see the grades of corpses \u2013 this was incredibly important to Great Qin.Bai Shan wiped away his tears and snot and promised Zhao Fu that this would be done soon. Afterwards, he hopped and skipped away like a little child.A few people who walked past him asked, \u201cOld man Bai, what\u2019s got you so happy\u201d?Bai Shan grinned and continuously praised Zhao Fu. Bai Shan said that Zhao Fu was an enlightened liege that was good at using talented people and that it was their blessing to be able to serve under such a lord.Even Wang Ergou, who flattered Zhao Fu every day, felt awed. He had never seen such shameless flattering before.Following this, Zhao Fu arranged the Great Qin Village\u2019s first Martial Arts Competition. Anyone could participate, and the top two people would be given important positions. Everyone else who did well would receive monetary prizes.The competition caused the Great Qin Village to become incredibly lively. All the races participated, including the Elves, Grey Dwarves, and Goblins. Zhao Fu had two main reasons for holding this competition. The first was to see if he had overlooked any talents. The second was to make the different races get along with each other better. After all, they were all living creatures and had their own emotions; they were not just numbers. As such, Zhao Fu took their feelings into consideration \u2013 after all, people could support a regime or completely overthrow it.The first emperors who laid China\u2019s foundations all understood this, but it was a pity that those who came after them only wanted to enjoy themselves. This was why there were so many dynasties in China.The Martial Arts Competition lasted for an entire day, and out of the final two victors, one of them was a Strong Orc called Saar. He was incredibly strong and liked direct fights, meeting force with force. He had beaten many Goblin Warriors to the ground, and his body was covered with firm muscles. Whenever a challenger saw his fearsome Orc appearance, he or she couldn\u2019t help but take a few steps back.The other victor took everyone by surprise: it was Wang Ergou. With his tiny frame, even a Goblin Warrior should have been able to beat him to death, but in the end, he was one of the victors. This was because he used all kinds of shameless tactics; crotch shots and nostril hits were nothing to him. One time, he continuously provoked his opponent, causing the opponent to feel incredibly infuriated. Following this, he had even mooned his opponent and let loose a thundering fart. His opponent had been completely enraged and charged towards Wang Ergou to beat him to death. However, he had slipped on a banana peel prepared by Wang Ergou, causing him to fall off the stage and lose the fight.Even though Wang Ergou was one of the final two victors, his reputation became terrible. However, many people still admired him because he would be greatly nurtured by Zhao Fu.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter the Martial Arts Competition concluded, Zhao Fu called Saar and Wang Ergou into the Village Hall. Zhao Fu was sitting in a chair with Bai Qi and his other main subordinates standing beside him. After walking in, Saar and Wang Ergou half-knelt on the ground and waited for Zhao Fu to speak.Zhao Fu slightly smiled and said, \u201cBoth of you have surprised me \u2013 especially you, Wang Ergou.\u201dAn awkward look appeared on Wang Ergou\u2019s face, but he smiled and said, \u201cThis is because of Your Majesty\u2019s blessings.\u201dAfter lightly laughing, Zhao Fu handed the two S grade Orbs to them. After using them and seeing their new Grades, they were completely stunned and quickly kowtowed to express their thanks towards Zhao Fu.Seeing that matters here had been taken care of, Zhao Fu returned to the real world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123After returning to the real world, Zhao Fu left his room and prepared to go down to the restaurant that was for members of the collateral family. The collateral family has lower status than even the branch families because the branch families have pure Ying family blood.Even though the treatment of the collateral family was not as good as the main family or branch families\u2019, it was still not bad. Members of the collateral family could eat whatever they wanted and however much they wanted, and it would be paid for by the Ying family.It was a clear day today, and there were very few clouds in the sky. The sun was high in the sky, and its rays were quite hot.Within a building, a slightly-skinny middle-aged man watched Zhao Fu walk through his sniper scope. A trace of a smile appeared on his face as he slowly aimed the sniper rifle towards Zhao Fu\u2019s head and slowly pressed down on the trigger. He acted as if he had already seen Zhao Fu\u2019s head explode as his brain and blood splattered everywhere.Zhao Fu was walking down the path when he saw that someone had dropped a $1 coin. That person must have been quite rich and satisfied to not bother picking up a $1 coin, and Zhao Fu bent over to pick it up.Bang!Zhao Fu\u2019s hairs stood on end when he heard the gunshot. He felt something shoot over his head, causing his mind to go blank. His heart rapidly thumped, and he felt as if time had slowed down as he breathed heavily.In the next second, Zhao Fu dove into the shrubbery beside him, and after crawling through, he started to run for his life.Bang!Another gunshot rang out by the time the nearby people also reacted and started to chaotically run around. Zhao Fu took this opportunity to run back into his room and slam the door shut. He leaned against the door, his body slightly trembling. He never expected death to be so close to him; if he hadn\u2019t bent down, his head would have been hit by that bullet.The middle-aged man silently cursed as an ugly expression appeared on his face when he saw Zhao Fu run back into the building. The man threw away his sniper rifle and chose to escape because he knew what he was doing.This man was called Zhou Qian, and he was part of an assassin organization. When he first received this request, he was quite hesitant because he knew how terrifying the Five Great Families were. Even a top-tier assassin organization wouldn\u2019t dare to easily offend them.However, the request this time was a member of the collateral family who did not look too important. He wasn\u2019t part of the main family and killing him wouldn\u2019t draw too much attention. The reward for this request was $60 million, and $30 million had been transferred to him already. Moreover, the client would provide a way for him to escape overseas, which was why Zhou Qian dared to take such a great risk.In the beginning, he had tried to infiltrate the district, but this was no ordinary district. Even though only members of the collateral family were living here, the security was still top notch, so Zhou Qian could only try to snipe Zhao Fu.However, now that he had failed, he had to escape. The Ying family would soon come here to investigate.In his room, Zhao Fu gradually calmed down. Without needing to think about it, Zhao Fu already knew who was behind this. Apart from the Li family, who saw him as a threat and wanted to get rid of him, who would do such a thing? They must have found out that he possessed the Ying family\u2019s bloodline and were worried that he would establish himself and make trouble for the Li family, so they tried to kill him quickly.\u201cLi family! One day, I\u2019ll destroy your entire family,\u201d Zhao Fu said icily.In her last words, Zhao Fu\u2019s mother had told him not to seek revenge against the Li family. Even after he obtained the Great Qin\u2019s legacy, he had gone about his own matters and did not think about his past with the Li family, nor did he consider harming the Li family.However, the Li family had crossed Zhao Fu\u2019s bottom line time and time again, and he had nearly died just then. Zhao Fu\u2019s hatred towards the Li family reached its peak, and he clenched his fists and gritted his teeth.However, after Zhao Fu came back to his senses, he realized that he was nothing in the real world. He had no money or power, so how could he escape from such a powerful family?Today they had sent a sniper, but tomorrow they could send people to kill him directly, and the day after they might choose to use poison. Since he had become a thorn in their hearts, they would do everything they could to kill him.Perhaps he could reveal that he was Great Qin\u2019s Legatee and receive the full support of the Ying family. After all, the Ying family was one of the Five Great Families and was much more powerful than the Li family.Even though the Great Tang Empire was a \u2018Celestial Empire\u2019 and was much more powerful than the Sui Dynasty\u2019s Yang family, the Qin Dynasty\u2019s Ying family had gathered its strength for hundreds of years more than the Li family. As such, he could use the Ying family to destroy the Li family.If Zhao Fu could wipe out the Li family and make Li Zhe kneel in front of his mother\u2019s grave and repent before killing him, it would simply be perfect!\u201cHahahahaha\u2026\u201d Zhao Fu suddenly started to laugh at his own naivety. \u201cDo you think that the Ying family will passionately welcome you and treat you as the master of the Ying family if you stand up and yell that you\u2019re the Great Qin\u2019s Legatee? Do you really think that\u2019s possible?\u201dZhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but mock himself. He was merely an outsider that had a bit of the Ying family\u2019s blood, so how could they give him the Ying family? Who would accept the Ying family being given to an outsider?The main family members looked down greatly on those who were even worse than the branch families. If the Ying family built an empire in the Heaven Awaken World, the collateral family members would be at the lowest rank of the hierarchy, and they would only be used to consolidate the Ying family\u2019s rule.Once he announced his identity, the Ying family would announce him to be the master of Great Qin on the surface. However, the Ying family would secretly use many methods to control him. If the main family could take the Great Qin Legacy away from him, he would lose his value and most likely be killed by them.\u201cIn this world, brothers can kill brothers and fathers can kill their sons for their own gain. Anyone would do anything for his or her own benefit, so how could they not lay their hands on you, who they see as an outsider?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs such, even if Zhao Fu announced his identity, he would not necessarily be safe. He would be in a precarious situation with the Li family threatening him openly and the Ying family threatening him secretly. It would be almost impossible for him to protect himself.Right now, anyone could easily crush him to death \u2013 that was how weak he was.That was the problem: the Li family and the Ying family were both incredibly dangerous, and he could escape from neither of them. What should he do? Zhao Fu lapsed into deep thought.Suddenly, someone knocked on his door, surprising him. Zhao Fu turned to look at the door.\u201cIs Mr. Zhao available?\u201d A woman said. Zhao Fu was familiar with this voice, and when he looked through the peephole, he saw a woman standing outside with a few security guards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Fu thought about it before opening the door and asking, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dJi Qin slightly smiled and said, \u201cMr. Zhao, Big Miss Xi has invited you to meet with her.\u201dZhao Fu stared at her in surprise for a split-second. He knew who Big Miss Xi was. She was called Ying Xi and the successor of one of the Ying family\u2019s 6 main bloodlines. Why did she want to meet him? It wasn\u2019t because his identity as the Great Qin Legatee had been exposed because no one could possibly know about that.\u201cWhy does Ying Xi want to see me?\u201d Zhao Fu realized that she might have heard about what had just happened and thought that there was value in using him.Zhao Fu thought about it before nodding and leaving with Ji Qin and the security guards. They came to a beautiful garden where there was a beautiful young woman who looked around 23 or 24 years old. She was wearing a white dress and looked like a celestial goddess among the flowers.\u201cBig Miss Xi, I\u2019ve brought him here,\u201d Ji Qin respectfully said as she slightly bowed.Ying Xi had just picked a small flower and charmingly smiled before looking at Zhao Fu and nodding.When Ying Xi looked at him, he remained expressionless and calmly stood still.\u201cCome with me!\u201d Ying Xi said before turning and walking away.Zhao Fu followed behind her, and soon, they reached a pavilion within the garden. Ying Xi sat on an exquisitely-made bamboo chair and signaled for Zhao Fu to also sit. Zhao Fu nodded and sat down facing her.\u201cDo you know why I asked to meet you?\u201d Ying Xi asked as she slightly smiled.Zhao Fu thought about it, and even though he could guess why, he pretended not to know and shook his head.Seeing this, Ying Xi asked in satisfaction, \u201cThen do you hate the Li family?\u201dJust as expected, through what had happened, the Ying family\u2019s higher-ups had found out about his identity. Zhao Fu did not hide anything and truthfully replied, \u201cI do!\u201d\u201cIf I help you take revenge, would you be willing to join my faction? Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll make sure you stay safe, and no one will be able to threaten your wellbeing.\u201dYing Xi did not beat around the bush and directly made her intentions clear after seeing the hatred in Zhao Fu\u2019s eyes.\u201cHelp me take revenge?\u201dZhao Fu knew that Ying Xi would not actually help him take revenge. Rather, she wanted to use him as a pawn to control the Li family in the future.In the chaotic times to come, the world would be filled with war. Each of the large families started to make preparations, and the Ying family was no exception. If the Ying family wanted to deal with the Li family, Zhao Fu would be an important piece.This was because Zhao Fu also had the Li family\u2019s bloodline. Even though he was not much right now, if the Ying family supported him, he would be able to divide the Li family and control it while remaining as one of the Ying family\u2019s pieces.The Ying family had many collateral family members, so why would it choose to nurture Zhao Fu? It was because the pawn could not be too stupid, or the Ying family would be unable to control the Li family, and the pawn also couldn\u2019t be too intelligent because he or she could turn against the Ying family.Moreover, Zhao Fu\u2019s identity was also quite attractive. Controlling someone with the Ying family\u2019s bloodline was much better than controlling a member of the Li family\u2019s collateral family.Zhao Fu had long since guessed Ying Xi\u2019s goal, and everything she said was within his expectations. As such, Zhao Fu did not act too stupidly, nor did he reveal too much of his shrewdness.Before coming here, Zhao Fu had wanted to expose his status as Great Qin\u2019s Legatee. Even though the Ying family and Li family were both quite dangerous, he had no choice. If he did not reveal his status, he might be killed by the Li family, so he had to reveal himself to stay alive and hope to slowly deal with the Ying family in the future.Zhao Fu\u2019s current schemes were enough to make even some of the old foxes terrified and the strategists to be in awe. Zhao Fu had experienced many hardships since he was young and seen much of the world. His experiences let him understand the nature of this cruel world.Zhao Fu had been by himself most of his life, and loneliness was indeed something that could bring someone pain and drive a person to madness. However, it could also cause a person to mature and see through other people\u2019s hearts, which was why Zhao Fu\u2019s personality and intellect were like this.Zhao Fu nodded and agreed to Ying Xi\u2019s request. Since she would treat him as a pawn, he would use her to guarantee his safety for now. They were both merely using each other, and agreeing was in Zhao Fu\u2019s best interests right now.For now, Ying Xi could control him completely, so he would act as she wished. As for the Li family, he didn\u2019t need anyone to help him take revenge \u2013 only by staining one\u2019s hands with the blood of those who one hated could one be satisfied.Ying Xi was delighted when Zhao Fu agreed. Zhao Fu was an important pawn in her plans, so she immediately ordered for Zhao Fu to be treated well and moved to an even safer place.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Bang!Within a room in the Li family\u2019s residence, Li Feng furiously slammed his palm on the table and yelled, \u201cThe Ying family has gone too far!\u201dLi Feng was this furious because the Ying family had sent a message, \u201cIf Zhao Fu dies, we will slaughter 100 people from the main family.\u201dThe Ying family did not put the Li family in its eyes at all. The Li family was still quite a large family and had its own pride, so how could Li Feng accept such a thing?\u201cHmph!\u201d Li Feng coldly harrumphed as he said, \u201cThe Ying family is too arrogant. Do they think that the Li family has no talents and would fear the Ying family?\u201dWhen the butler saw that Li Feng was so furious that it looked like he wanted to start a war with the Ying family, the butler, who was beside him, quickly said, \u201cSir, please calm down. Acting against the Ying family right now simply isn\u2019t rational. They haven\u2019t found the Great Qin\u2019s Legatee yet, so we should lay low for now. In the future, the Li family will definitely grow to be much more powerful than the Ying family, and it won\u2019t be too late to deal with them then.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLi Feng nodded, his anger receding slightly as he asked, \u201cHave you disposed of the assassin? We can\u2019t give the Ying family an opportunity to grasp onto us.\u201dThe butler respectfully replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sir, he has already been dealt with.\u201dLi Feng let out a sigh of relief. If the assassin had fallen into the Ying family\u2019s hands, there would have been great trouble for the Li family. It would have been possible for the Ying family to say that the Li family had tried to kill an illegitimate child but failed, causing the Li family\u2019s reputation to take a hit.However, Li Feng felt that he had overlooked something. After that bastard joined the Ying family, he had sent an assassin after him. No matter how well he took care of that matter, the Ying family definitely knew that the assassin was sent by the Li family. However, if the Li family did not act now and allowed Zhao Fu to grow, dealing with him would become more and more troublesome in the future. If he had known that this would happen, he would have killed both the mother and the son back then.Li Feng couldn\u2019t help but hate Zhao Fu even more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A surprised smile appeared on his face as he said, \u201cWho would have thought that I would have a big brother from a different mother!\u201dAs Great Tang\u2019s Legatee, Li Baiqing received the full support of the Li family. They poured all of their resources into him, which he had used to create an intelligence network. That was how he had found out that his grandpa had sent an assassin after Zhao Fu.After thinking about it, Li Baiqing thought to himself, \u201c _Zhao Fu, the Li family has wronged you. If you don\u2019t do anything to harm the Li family, I\u2019ll definitely spare you in the future and make it up to you. However, if you become the Ying family\u2019s pawn and try to harm the Li family, don\u2019t blame me for being merciless.\u201d_\u201cYour Majesty, what should we do now?\u201d A formidable-looking young man asked as he lowered his head and cupped his fist.This young man had an extraordinary background. He was the descendant of a famed general of Great Tang and was called Li Guangye. Even though he was part of his own family, after meeting Li Baiqing, he was awed by his talent and saw Li Baiqing as a wise liege. As such, he decided to do as his ancestor did by giving his loyalty to Great Tang.Great Tang also spawned 2 historical figures. One was Xue Rengui, a peerless general who fought and won countless battles and made many heroic contributions to Great Tang. The other was Wei Zheng, a great Prime Minister who dared to speak forthrightly and remonstrate the Emperor.Li Baiqing replied to Li Guangye, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it for now. Conflict between the Li family and the Ying family isn\u2019t good for either of us, and it will only serve to benefit others. We\u2019ll let everything proceed naturally.\u201dLi Guangye nodded and retreated to one side to serve Li Baiqing.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..As for Zhao Fu, he had been moved to where the main family members lived, and Ying Xi had even given him a bodyguard to protect him.That was all they could do for now. Zhao Fu was much safer now, and when he went to his new room, he took out the Heaven Awaken Stone and chose to enter the Heaven Awaken World.Zhao Fu discarded his unpleasant thoughts of the real world and completely focused on the Great Qin Village. Right now, the Great Qin Village was the only thing that Zhao Fu could rely on.Because the Orc threat had been eliminated, Zhao Fu started to scheme about godly spirits. However, he first had to consider whether he could use them for the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation, and he also needed energy stones. With the limited amount of energy left, how could it refine a godly spirit?Energy stones would definitely be an important resource, whether it was now or in the future. After all, without them, he would not be able to use the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation. However, energy stones were simply too expensive, and they were worth 10 gold coins each. That was 100,000 copper coins!Zhao Fu did not have that much money, but he could use the equipment he obtained from the region of bones to exchange for energy stones. However, equipment was something that Zhao Fu desperately lacked at the moment.After conquering so many Outlanders, Zhao Fu took 100 Kobolds from the 300 he had conquered, 300 Goblins from the 700 he had conquered, 100 Orcs from the 400 he had conquered, and 600 Elves from the 1,400 he had conquered to add to his army. Now, Zhao Fu had 2,900 soldiers, but he only had 1,000 or so pieces of Blue grade armor. How could he sell any when he was greatly lacking equipment?Energy stones were incredibly difficult to obtain, and unless he found a way to earn massive amounts of money, it would be impossible for him to buy any. Zhao Fu started to wonder if he could find any mines for them in the Forest of Horrors.As such, he could only put his plan of refining a godly spirit on hold. Of course, his plans now were to continue exploring the Forest of Horrors. Right now, Zhao Fu had only explored the 30-kilometer radius around the Great Qin Village, so he wanted to see what other gains he could obtain from outside that area.Now, he had 2,900 soldiers in total and bringing along so many soldiers was a bit too much. Zhao Fu decided to split them into two teams \u2013 one would be led by himself and the other by Bai Qi. They would explore the region around them from different directions.A few days later, the two teams finished exploring the 50-kilometer radius outside of the Great Qin Village. They did not find anything significant, but they did conquer another four Basic Villages. There was an ordinary Human Village, an ordinary Bandit Village, an ordinary Gnome Village, and an ordinary Goblin Village.These four villages were able to greatly increase the Great Qin Village\u2019s population because Zhao Fu employed tactics that kept as many people alive as possible. The four villages supplied him with an extra 1,300 people, and he moved 500 of them into his military, increasing it to 3,400 soldiers. Now, the Great Qin Village was definitely the most powerful village in the 100-kilometer radius around the village.Moreover, after conquering 4 Basic Villages, Zhao Fu obtained 200 Achievement Points, causing him to rank up to Third-Ranked Baron. Even though he was only Third-Ranked, it was still a baronage, which meant that he had the right to upgrade the Great Qin Village into a Town. Apart from this, Third-Ranked Barons also had other special privileges, such as more respect from the guards in main cities, 10% discounts at stores, the ability to buy houses within main cities, and the ability to become a resident of a main city without spending Merit Points.Zhao Fu was attracted by the ability to buy a house. In some virtual gaming novels, the characters would buy massive amounts of land and then develop and sell it for an astronomical profit.However, the houses in main cities could only be rented for now. Most people had to earn Merit Points and become a resident before they could buy land. However, they were limited to buying land in the Residential District and could not buy any land in the business or luxury areas, and there was a limit on how much land they could buy.Zhao Fu knew that he would be able to directly buy houses with his Third-Ranked Baron status, but there might be similar limits. However, he still decided to go to some main cities to have a look. He desperately lacked money, so he wanted to see if there were any good ways to earn large amounts of money quickly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu used the transportation channel and once again went to Holy Light City. There were not many changes there, and there were still just as many people. After arriving, Zhao Fu headed directly towards the real estate office in the Residential District.When Zhao Fu arrived, he found that there were only a few people there. Zhao Fu saw a few people he knew: there was Jiang Rou and a few of the Jiang family\u2019s people and the pompous young man from the Zhou family and a few of his followers hanging around.However, the pompous young man did not dare to go too far. The real estate office was managed by Holy Light City, so even though the Zhou family could act big around players, the Zhou family was nothing in the eyes of the residents of the main cities. If the Zhou family dared to offend the main city, no one from the Zhou family would dare to enter Holy Light City again. The might of a main city could not be defied by just anyone.Zhao Fu didn\u2019t bother dealing with the scene before him. First, it had nothing to do with him, and second, there was definitely a reason why the pompous young man dared to continuously harass the Jiang family\u2019s people without suffering any consequences.It could be because the Zhou family was simply too powerful, causing the Jiang family to lower their heads. After all, Zhao Fu could tell that the Jiang family was not weak at all. Alternatively, it could be because their families\u2019 elders supported them developing a relationship or at least permitted it, so no one intervened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Fu ignored them and walked into the real estate office to ask what benefits and restrictions Barons had.At this moment, Jiang Rou saw Zhao Fu and Bai Qi. Even though they were wearing cloaks, Jiang Rou recognized them immediately. She couldn\u2019t help but call out, \u201cExcuse me, are you Mr. Zhao?\u201dZhao Fu paused in surprise, not expecting to be recognized instantly. He nodded, indicating that he was.The pompous young man\u2019s expression became cold when he realized who those 2 people were. They were the ones who had beaten him up back then. When he had heard that the young man was a Legatee, Zhou Jie had thought that he had caused great trouble. However, after investigating, he found that there were no Legatees surnamed Zhao in the Forest of Horrors, and there were no powerful families in the Forest of Horrors either.After all, if a Legatee was in the Forest of Horrors, his or her family would also move to the Forest of Horrors to help him or her gather resources and develop. However, there were no such signs.Moreover, they had only thought that Zhao Fu was a Legatee because his followers addressed him as \u2018Your Majesty.\u2019 As such, there was no solid evidence that he was actually a Legatee.Zhou Jie believed Zhao Fu to be a commoner who liked acting cool by ordering his subordinates to address him as \u2018Your Majesty.\u2019 Goddamit, what a shameless person \u2013 even his family didn\u2019t dare to do such a thing.Zhou Jie coldly laughed. He believed that the people he had brought last time were too weak, and he had learned his lesson. From then onwards, he always had people who were fairly strong around in hopes of taking revenge on Zhao Fu someday.\u201cBoy, step outside with your elder if you dare,\u201d Zhou Jie said with a cold smile. He knew he definitely couldn\u2019t do anything in here, so he planned to call Zhao Fu outside to deal with him.Jiang Rou\u2019s expression became ugly, and she realized that she had inadvertently caused trouble for Zhao Fu. She had reported that there was a Legatee in the Forest of Horrors to her family. However, after they did some investigating, they completely disregarded her words and took them as a joke, causing her to be sternly reprimanded.Despite this, Jiang Rou still felt that Zhao Fu was extraordinary and believed that he was a Legatee, and a powerful one at that. In fact, she had a feeling that his name would one day resound across the world. Even if everyone took what she said to be a joke, she still believed it.\u201cZhou Jie, don\u2019t cause trouble; this won\u2019t be good for the Zhou family!\u201dJiang Rou tried to stop Zhou Jie, but he was too furious to listen to reason. After all, their families had acted as matchmakers for them, and Zhou Jie had long since started to see Jiang Rou as his fianc\u00e9e. Now that his fianc\u00e9e was trying to help another man, how could he not be angry?Zhao Fu was quite surprised that Jiang Rou would try to help him out. Regardless, he didn\u2019t have the time or energy to bother with Zhou Jie\u2019s provocations.When Zhou Jie saw that Zhao Fu was ignoring him, Zhou Jie ran up and tried to slap Zhao Fu while yelling, \u201cYou little bastard, didn\u2019t you hear your elder talking to you?\u201dZhao Fu\u2019s gaze became cold, but he didn\u2019t even bother moving. Beside him, Bai Qi coldly harrumphed, caught Zhou Jie\u2019s hand, and twisted. A crisp crack sounded out when Bai Qi broke Zhou Jie\u2019s arm.\u201cArghhh!\u201d Zhou Jie screamed pitifully. Zhou Jie\u2019s people rushed at Bai Qi to help Zhou Jie. Even though they could be considered strong among normal people, trying to fight against Bai Qi was simply seeking death.By now, Bai Qi\u2019s cultivation was already at Stage 0-7. Adding on the bonus stats from his equipment, how could they defeat him? In just a few hits, he had beaten all of them to the ground and injured them so badly that they couldn\u2019t even crawl.When Zhou Jie saw the thugs that he had paid so much money for defeated so easily, he immediately shouted fearfully at the manager of the real estate office, \u201cLook, he\u2019s attacking people! Hurry up and arrest him!\u201dHowever, something shocking happened. The manager, who normally acted indifferently towards players, respectfully walked over to Zhao Fu and said, \u201cEsteemed Baron!\u201dZhao Fu calmly nodded \u2013 evidently, this was one of the perks of his rise to Baronage. He turned to look at Zhou Jie, who was nursing his broken arm while staring at him with a look of disbelief, and asked the manager, \u201cWhat are you going to do about this?\u201dThe manager smiled and said, \u201cI personally saw this troublemaker attack Esteemed Baron first, and Esteemed Baron rightfully defended himself. This lowly one will immediately send for some people to throw them out.\u201dFollowing this, the manager called the guards to throw Zhou Jie and his thugs onto the street.Jiang Rou and everyone else watching had never expected things to take such a turn. No one had expected that Zhao Fu would already be a Baron \u2013 after all, even Jiang Rou, someone from a large family, had only just become a Citizen, and she was far away from becoming a Baroness.Most of the normal families had established their villages near main cities, so it was relatively safe there. However, that also meant that they didn\u2019t have many opportunities, so within the entire Forest of Horrors, only Zhao Fu had risen to the status of Baron.\u201cMr. Zhao, we meet again. I\u2019m terribly sorry for bringing trouble to you!\u201d Jiang Rou came to apologize for calling out to him, resulting in the present situation.Zhao Fu thought for a moment before replying, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, Miss Jiang. There\u2019s no need to apologize.\u201dJiang Rou still felt quite apologetic and said, \u201cThis matter was my fault, and I\u2019m truly sorry. Also, there\u2019s no need to call me Miss Jiang; you can just call me by my name.\u201dIn response, Zhao Fu nodded.At this moment, Jiang Rou couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cMr. Zhao, would it be alright for us to become friends?\u201dEveryone watching felt incredibly jealous; there were very few people who could make Miss Jiang take the initative.Zhao Fu hesitated before replying, \u201cAlright, but don\u2019t call me Mr. Zhao anymore \u2013 just call me Zhao Xin.\u201d Zhao Fu did not want to give out his real name, so he made up a name for himself.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe couldn\u2019t help but feel incredibly happy when she heard Zhao Fu agree and tell her his name. She lightly smiled, making her seem incredibly gentle and beautiful. Anyone looking at her couldn\u2019t help but space out.Zhao Fu was quite resistant to her charms though, and after chatting for a bit, he found out why Jiang Rou had come here. The Jiang family had made Holy Light City its main place of development and wanted to buy some land here.No one wanted ordinary residential land \u2013 the Jiang family wanted to buy land along a main street, but that land was restricted to residents, so the Jiang family could not buy it.Zhao Fu thought about it and realized that he could buy this land and then sell it for a high price to these families to make a massive sum of money.Zhao Fu thoughts raced, and he felt incredibly excited. However, when he heard what Jiang Rou said next, he became quite disappointed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123Zhao Fu was disappointed because Jiang Rou said that her family was only willing to pay up to 40 gold coins, which was 400,000 copper coins. However, he could only buy 4 energy stones with that amount of money. If Zhao Fu wanted to buy large amounts of energy stones, he would need a massive amount of money.First, there were 1,000 or so channels in the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation, so he needed at least 1,000 energy stones. Zhao Fu had asked Old Logue before how to get a godly spirit to descend, to which Old Logue had told him that a godly spirit\u2019s main body could not descend, but it could send a clone. Only through many sacrifices could such a thing happen.Zhao Fu had no idea how strong a godly spirit\u2019s clone would be, but even if it was only a weak godly spirit, it would still be quite powerful, so he definitely needed at least 1,000 energy stones. Energy stones were roughly worth 10 gold coins each, which meant that 1,000 energy stones would cost 10,000 gold coins or 100 million copper coins.Zhao Fu started to suspect whether he had gone mad by considering to spend so much money on something that might not even necessarily work. However, whenever he thought about refining a godly spirit that could determine the lives and deaths of tens of thousands of beings, he knew that he would definitely obtain something heaven-defying from it.Given that he needed 100 million copper coins, Zhao Fu scorned Jiang Rou\u2019s 40,000 copper coins. However, after thinking about it, he realized that a family paying 40,000 copper coins at this stage was not bad at all.Zhao Fu first asked the manager what special privileges Barons had, and he learned that he could hire 10 Stage 1 soldiers in Holy Light City and could buy 10 lots of land in Holy Light City apart from the Mayor\u2019s Residence.Zhao Fu\u2019s plan of becoming rich through real estate crumbled when he heard this. He could only buy 10 lots of land, and he would not have anyone to sell to. Currently, all of the large families were too poor.He could sell a lot of land to Jiang Rou as a gesture of friendship and accept her 40 gold coins. Normal places in the Residential District cost tens of thousands of copper coins, while those on main streets cost hundreds of thousands of copper coins. The place that Jiang Rou wanted to buy was on the luxurious Nanda Street, and it cost 310,000 copper coins.Zhao Fu helped her buy this plot of land and returned the remaining amount of money to Jiang Rou.When Zhao Fu easily dealt with the problem that had been troubling her this entire time, she felt even more in awe of him, and she said gratefully, \u201cThank you, Zhao Xin!\u201dZhao Fu did not pay this much mind. It seemed that he would not be able to profit that much from real estate, so he did not plan to invest much into it. After hearing about the privileges Barons received, he felt slightly disappointed.The ability to hire 10 Stage 1 soldiers wasn\u2019t too bad. If Zhao Fu had a Normal grade Village, he might have hired them already, but he had a Legendary grade Village and a special legacy, while even the main cities were only Gold grade.He could hire 10 soldiers, but he would not be able to guarantee the absolute loyalty of those 10 soldiers. If news about the Legendary grade Village was leaked, even the powers within the main cities wouldn\u2019t be able to help themselves from wanting to take it away from him.After saying goodbye to Jiang Rou, Zhao Fu returned to the Great Qin Village in disappointment. Suddenly, someone ran over to report, \u201cYour Majesty! We\u2019ve found a massive bronze concentrate mine 53 kilometers to the west!\u201dZhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but feel delighted. Bronze concentrate was like normal bronze ore, but it could be used to create Blue grade equipment. Just how big was this \u2018massive\u2019 bronze concentrate mine?Zhao Fu called Saar over \u2013 he was that expedition\u2019s captain \u2013 and asked him for more details. The bronze concentrate mine was an open-pit mine, and it was roughly 2 square kilometers in area. It was likely that there was even more under the ground, and after hearing all of this, Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but feel excited.Saar continued, \u201cYour Majesty, there are roughly 1,000 or so Grey Dwarves settled around there as well.\u201dZhao Fu nodded. Following this, he gathered his entire army and headed towards the bronze concentrate mine.After arriving, a look of shock appeared on Zhao Fu\u2019s face. There was not a single tree in front of him. At a glance, all he could see was bronze concentrate, and it covered the ground.Even though Saar had told him how big the open-pit mine was, he was still in awe when he saw it for himself.By now, the Grey Dwarves who were mining had discovered Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers. They immediately threw down their tools in fear and ran back to their village. Soon, the entire village was on high alert ,and Grey Dwarves wearing bronze concentrate armor and holding bronze concentrate axes and hammers walked out.Zhao Fu took his soldiers and surrounded the Grey Dwarf Village. Zhao Fu was quite envious when he saw that the 1,000 or so Grey Dwarves all had brand-new, excellent Blue grade equipment. There were so many good pieces of equipment.Zhao Fu looked towards the Grey Dwarf Village, but he did not plan to attack. The Grey Dwarves were all forging masters, and if Zhao Fu took over this mine, he would have to rely on these Grey Dwarves to do most of the forging for him.As such, he called one of his Grey Dwarf subordinates over to interpret what he said. He then said in a loud voice, \u201cI don\u2019t want to harm any of you, and all of you should know how valuable this bronze concentrate mine is. Even if I don\u2019t take it today, others will come in the future to take it. As long as you surrender to me, I can promise that your lives will not change, and I will send people to protect you.\u201dAfter loudly declaring these things to them, the Grey Dwarves did not respond for a while. Zhao Fu looked at Bai Qi, and Bai Qi immediately ordered to bring out the 60 ballistae. The Gnome Mechanics Scholars had created quite a few ballistae over the past few days, and all of them were aimed towards the Grey Dwarf Village.\u201cI\u2019ll say it again \u2013 I don\u2019t want to harm any of you, but don\u2019t force me to do it!\u201d Zhao Fu once again called out.However, when he saw that there was still no response, he gave the order to fire the ballistae. 180 bolts shot out from the ballistae, and they gave off a terrifying aura. Of course, Zhao Fu did not have them aimed towards the Grey Dwarves but towards the houses. The bolts flew over the Grey Dwarves\u2019 heads and pierced through their wooden houses.After seeing the ballistae\u2019s might, the Grey Dwarf Village finally responded. A Grey Dwarf with a massive beard walked out and said in a loud voice, \u201cLord, will you really abide by your promise? If we surrender to you, will our lives really stay the same, and will you send people to protect us?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu obviously wouldn\u2019t send them to fight \u2013 their value lay in their forging skills, and with such a big bronze concentrate mine, it would take these 1,000 Dwarves 10 or so years to finish using it. Zhao Fu nodded and said, \u201cAs the Legatee of Great Qin, I swear this to you!\u201dFollowing this, the Grey Dwarf with the massive beard led the other Grey Dwarves and knelt down to Zhao Fu, signaling their surrender.Even though the Dwarves could be ill-tempered at times, they were normally sincere, loyal, frank, and straightforward. They were not the scheming type, and when they saw that it would be impossible for them to resist Zhao Fu, they decided to surrender.Zhao Fu was quite happy and took his soldiers in. This time, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t relocate the village and only conquered it. The Grey Dwarf Village was called Rhode Village, and it was a Normal grade Village. The big-bearded Grey Dwarf was the Village Chief, Rhode.After entering the Grey Dwarf Village, Rhode gave Zhao Fu a big surprise, making Zhao Fu feel as if he had won the lottery.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123The massive surprise Rhode gave Zhao Fu was that apart from the armor and equipment that the Grey Dwarves were already holding, they also had another 4,000 pieces of equipment.Hearing this, Zhao Fu quickly asked Rhode to take him there.Soon, Rhode brought Zhao Fu to a very large storehouse. It was filled with bronze armor and weapons, and they all shined with a metallic light. Zhao Fu felt as if he had walked into a massive treasure trove, and he quickly went over to take a look.[Bronze Concentrate Armour]: Grade: Blue, Stats: Strength +1, Constitution +1, Description: Superior quality armor forged from bronze concentrate.[Bronze Concentrate Sword]: Grade: Blue, Stats: Strength +1, Agility +1, Description: Superior quality sword forged from bronze concentrate.All of them were quality goods and gave at least 2 points of stats. They were worth around 600 or so silver coins each, and obtaining them meant that everyone in Zhao Fu\u2019s army would be able to have new equipment, boosting their strength greatly. Moreover, with this super-big bronze concentrate mine, they would not have to rely on obtaining the rusty equipment from the region of bones anymore.Suddenly, Zhao Fu\u2019s eyes flashed as he thought of a good way to make money. Since he no longer needed the rusty Blue grade equipment from the region of bones, he could sell all of them now.Li Wen obtained 100 or so pieces of equipment every day, but because they lacked people with forging skills, repairing them took quite a long time. Now that they had an extra 1,000 Grey Dwarves, they could quickly repair them. The 1,000 or so pieces of equipment that Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers were currently using could also be sold.Of course, Zhao Fu did not plan to sell them to a shop; rather, he wanted to open his own shop. He would only be able to sell the rusty equipment for 300 silver coins a piece to a shop, but if he sold them himself, he would be able to sell them for 400 silver coins each.Zhao Fu felt quite excited \u2013 he had come another step closer to refining a godly spirit. Afterwards, Zhao Fu went over to the Grey Dwarf Barracks.[Dwarven Warrior]: F+ grade Military. Description: Powerful warriors among the Dwarves. Effect: Receives [Brandish].[Dwarven Blacksmith]: D- grade Military. Description: A Dwarf who has raised his or her Dwarven talents to its limit. Effect: Receives [Enhanced Forging].After looking through these professions, Zhao Fu found that the Grey Dwarves had a special military profession, Dwarven Blacksmith. It was D- grade, which was quite powerful. After all, Zhao Fu\u2019s Demon Priest profession was also D- grade. However, Zhao Fu\u2019s profession was a battle profession, while this was a trade profession. Adding on the Dwarves\u2019 latent talent in forging, this profession was quite incredible.Rhode Village was currently an Intermediate Village, and the limit of the number of Dwarven Blacksmiths was 10.After going through Rhode Village, Zhao Fu started to make plans for the mine. The gigantic bronze concentrate mine was simply priceless, and it was enough to make anyone go mad over it. Even main cities would want to take it for themselves if they discovered it.As such, Zhao Fu stationed 2,000 of his soldiers there and ordered them to strictly keep any creatures from coming within 10 kilometers of the mine. This place would determine Great Qin\u2019s future.Following this, Zhao Fu also instructed his people to construct a teleportation channel here to make it convenient to move to and from the Great Qin Village.Zhao Fu then split his remaining 1,400 soldiers into two teams and placed them under the command of Zhang Dahu, Saar, and his other capable generals. They were to continue exploring the Forest of Horrors and attack any Basic Villages.Now, Basic Villages were like bits of meat hanging around Zhao Fu\u2019s mouth, waiting for him to devour them. If they discovered any Intermediate Villages, they could merge the two teams and attack it. If they discovered any Advanced Villages, Zhao Fu would personally take command.As such, Zhao Fu did not bother with Basic and Intermediate Villages, and he left them to his subordinates.By now, Zhao Fu already had 20 villages: eight of them were Human Villages, four were Goblin Villages, three were Gnome Villages, two were Kobold Villages, one was an Orc Village, one was an Elf Village, and one was a Grey Dwarf Village.Including the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu\u2019s villages spawned at least 130 villagers every day. In three days, he would be able spawn more villagers than what a Basic Village could have. After reaching this point, Zhao Fu finally started to slow down the population growth.After returning to the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu took the teleportation channel to Holy Light City and bought a spatial ring. Zhao Fu had long since wanted to buy one, but he had forgotten about it every time. Spatial rings were quite expensive, and a spatial ring that had 10 square meters of storage cost 10 gold coins.After buying a spatial ring, Zhao Fu returned to the Great Qin Village. He gathered the money that he had collected after all this time and many pieces of equipment before going off to start his shop in Holy Light City.Just as he was about to leave, Liu Mei rushed over and blocked Zhao Fu\u2019s way. Behind her was Asani, the 15-year-old Elf, and Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but wonder why they were together.At this moment, Liu Mei unhappily said to Zhao Fu, \u201cYour Majesty, I also want to go to a main city. Why don\u2019t you ever bring me?\u201d\u201cWhy would I bring you? I have serious matters to take care of there,\u201d Zhao Fu responded, feeling strange.\u201cThen take me as well. I\u2019m quite pretty, so I\u2019ll be able to make you look better,\u201d Liu Mei said arrogantly in a confident manner.Zhao Fu was not sure what to say. Liu Mei was indeed quite beautiful, and she was the seductive type. However, rather than making him look better, she would most likely bring him trouble.As such, Zhao Fu resolutely refused.Liu Mei went over and hugged Zhao Fu\u2019s arm, rubbing her large chest against him as she said coquettishly, \u201cYour Majesty, I want to go, and so does little sister Asani.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe was using this ploy again. Zhao Fu got goosebumps all over his body, and when he heard what Liu Mei said, he looked towards Asani.There was still a trace of fear on Asani\u2019s face when she looked at Zhao Fu, but she still managed to nod as she looked at Zhao Fu with hopeful eyes.Zhao Fu thought about it and couldn\u2019t help but agree. However, he told them that he would only take them after sorting out the matter of opening the shop.Liu Mei cheerfully laughed and let go of Zhao Fu. She pulled Asani\u2019s arm as they ran off.Zhao Fu lightly smiled and shook his head before using the teleportation channel and going to Holy Light City.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were pandas, dolphins, penguins, and all sorts of other animals, and these novel wooden sculptures attracted many of the residents over.Zhao Fu suddenly had an idea \u2013 opening a restaurant here would be quite good. He could bring over many cuisines from the real world, such as hotpot, teppanyaki, and the like. As the saying went, \u2018Food is the god of people,\u2019 so this venture could earn him quite a bit of money because the residents here did not lack money at all.Zhao Fu arranged his thoughts and walked into the real estate office. He had brought all of the money he had, which was 103 gold coins. Of those 103 gold coins, he had obtained 45 of them from the Advanced Orc Village.Zhao Fu bought two lots of land at two bustling streets: one was 100 or so square meters and cost 25 gold coins, while the other one was 400 or so square meters and cost 65 gold coins. In total, he spent 90 gold coins.This was almost all of the money that Zhao Fu had. Zhao Fu knew that most players were currently quite poor, but in the future, they would gradually become richer as their economies of scale became greater.Adding on the lot of land he had bought for Jiang Rou, Zhao Fu had now bought three lots of land. He could still buy another seven, as Third-Ranked Barons could buy 10 lots of land.It was likely that he would be able to buy even more land if his status increased again. He could also go to Soldier Forest and Demon Tree City to buy more land.For now, Zhao Fu would establish his restaurant and equipment shop. Perhaps there were other people who also had the idea of opening a restaurant, but they were unable to buy any land. As such, Zhao Fu took this opportunity to open the first restaurant.He knew that Jiang Rou was planning to open a clothing store with the land he had helped her buy. She told him that she had obtained the Seven Arts Weaving Technique, which allowed her to create clothing. Even though the clothes she could make were only Normal grade, they were exceptionally beautiful and would draw many female customers.Of course, Zhao Fu did not help Jiang Rou too much. Even though he knew that Jiang Rou would most likely not act against him, that did not necessarily apply to the Jiang family. After all, a family always placed profits first.As such, Zhao Fu left a way out for himself. Even though the Jiang family had bought the property, it was still under his own name.Within the Jiang family, the highest status that anyone had was Citizen, so they could not buy land for themselves. As such, Zhao Fu was completely justified in leaving this way out for himself. If they dared to try to do anything to him, he would mercilessly take the land back. He didn\u2019t want to be someone who kindly helped someone else but was trampled on in the end.Zhao Fu was going to use the 100 square meter space as the equipment shop after doing some simple renovations to the building. However, the restaurant\u2019s decorations needed to be exquisitely furnished. He could fit 90 or so tables in the hall on the first floor, 12 private rooms on the second floor, and 4 VIP rooms on the third floor.Zhao Fu then contracted for the renovations to be done for 30 gold coins. He also needed to hire chefs and waiters for the restaurant, while his own people could manage the equipment shop. All they would have to do was write out the prices and receive money.However, running a place like a restaurant was fairly risky because others could easily gossip about it and make trouble for it. As such, apart from the manager, Zhao Fu decided to hire players.He hung a sign outside the restaurant, seeking to hire 15 waitresses \u2013 the only requirement was that they were hardworking and diligent. Their monthly wage would be 3,000 copper coins. He also wanted to hire 5 chefs, and their genders did not matter. However, they had to be able to cook all sorts of cuisines from the real world. Their monthly wage would be 8,000 copper coins per month.As soon as Zhao Fu hung up the sign, it immediately attracted quite a few people over. Even though the wages were only 3,000 copper coins per month for a waitress, in the real world, that would be $30,000. That sort of rate for a waitress was amazing, and it was even more so for the chefs.Many people started to apply, and the waitresses were quite easy to select: Zhao Fu generally chose those who had good looks and were used to working in such environments. However, it was much more difficult to choose the chefs.Even though they all said that they could make all sorts of cuisines and seemed quite professional, how could he know just how good they were without trying their food? As such, Zhao Fu took the applicants into the kitchen and asked them to cook some dishes for him to try.The applicants all started by picking out ingredients, all of which were fairly basic, such as radishes, cucumbers, potatoes, etc.After washing the ingredients, they started to cut them.Zhao Fu watched on the side as the applicants quickly chopped the ingredients on the cutting boards, turning the ingredients into slices or cubes. Everyone looked like a proper chef, and at least from their skills with a knife, it seemed that there were not any scammers among them.Zhao Fu even saw a skinny youth who had knife skills that were close to a godly level. He pressed a chunk of radish against the chopping board, and without even looking at it, his knife seemed to dance with a mind of its own\u2026 as chopping sounds rapidly sounded out, he looked as if he was a master pianist elegantly playing the piano.Zhao Fu anticipated what his food would taste like. The youth had introduced himself as Huo Qing, and he was only slightly older than him.Zhao Fu had been wearing a cloak this entire time, so none of them were able to see what Zhao Fu looked like. They only knew that he was a man, and all of them were quite curious towards their mysterious boss.This was the first restaurant opened by a player, and just this alone was able to attract many people. With Zhao Fu\u2019s black cloak, he seemed even more profound and mysterious.Afterwards, everyone started to cook their food. Huo Qing once again caused Zhao Fu\u2019s eyes to light up \u2013 Huo Qing flicked his pan, sending his ingredients high into the air before falling back into the pan perfectly. He lightly sprinkled some condiments into the pan, and every one of his movements seemed as graceful and flowing as water and clouds.The most anticipated moment came. Everyone had cooked a dish and placed it in front of Zhao Fu. The 15 waitresses that Zhao Fu had chosen also stood by the side and looked on curiously. Zhao Fu was quite excited to try the dish made by the youth called Huo Qing \u2013 after seeing his skills in chopping and cooking, he was certain that his skills were master level.Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but grab his chopsticks and try the julienned radish dish made by Huo Qing.Every strand of radish was the same size and looked incredibly well-presented. They were as white as snow and did not look like they had been cooked at all. There was a bit of spring onion sprinkled on top, giving the dish a faint but delicious aroma.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu picked some up with his chopsticks and gently placed them into his mouth. He slowly chewed and savored the taste when his face suddenly froze as he spat out a mouthful of radish. He completely took back what he had thought before \u2013 a professional scammer had mixed his way in here!How could this dish look so good but be so appalling? It was neither salty nor sweet, and it was simply indescribably horrible.When Zhao Fu split out his mouthful of food, everyone was quite surprised.Huo Qing awkwardly smiled and asked, \u201cBoss, why did you spit it out? Is it not to your liking? That\u2019s a special dish that I created.\u201dAs he spoke, he took the dish to the waitresses to try. Zhao Fu did not stop him \u2013 he wanted to see if it was just him who thought that it was disgusting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The plate of julienned radishes looked incredibly delicious, yet Zhao Fu had spat out a mouthful after trying it.Some of the waitresses walked over and also tried a mouthful each before they all spat out the radishes. Huo Qing felt awkward to the point of death, and he could only stand there and sigh to himself.Afterwards, Zhao Fu tried the other dishes. Most of them were quite good, and the final dish he tried was also a plate of julienned radishes. They looked quite similar to Huo Qing\u2019s and were presented quite well as well. After his last horrible experience, Zhao Fu felt quite wary, but in order to be fair, he still tried it.Zhao Fu immediately tasted a flavor that was not something that a normal person could come up with. The radishes were sweet and crisp without a trace of spiciness or zest. After trying a mouthful, it made Zhao Fu immediately want to eat another mouthful.\u201cWho made this?\u201d Zhao Fu looked up towards the chefs.At this moment, a tall and slim young woman wearing an old-fashioned long skirt and a veil stepped out. Even though no one could see her facial features, everyone knew that she was definitely a beauty.A beauty like this with such astonishing culinary skills definitely wasn\u2019t here for the high wages. Zhao Fu\u2019s expression became serious and said to the others, \u201cGo outside for a while and wait for me to announce the results!\u201dThe others felt that something was strange and all left.After seeing Zhao Fu\u2019s expression when eating those julienned radishes, Huo Qing looked as if he had seen a true master. He ran over with a big smile and said enthusiastically to the mysterious woman, \u201cBeauty, I\u2019ll come to learn from under you as my master in the future!\u201dAfter saying this, Huo Qing happily raced off.\u201cWho are you? A great goddess like you isn\u2019t fitting for my little restaurant,\u201d Zhao Fu said as he looked at the mysterious woman.The mysterious woman slightly smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m not a great goddess; I\u2019m just a little commoner who thinks that food is the first necessity of man.\u201dZhao Fu frowned in surprise before his expression became even more serious. He never thought that he would meet someone from the Hundred Schools of Thought so early on \u2013 \u2018Food is the first necessity of man,\u2019 was definitely something only someone from the School of Gourmet would say.\u201cPeople from the Hundred Schools of Thought all have prestigious statuses; this little restaurant is not suitable for such a grand figure like yourself. It\u2019s better for you to seek employment elsewhere!\u201dEveryone from the Hundred Schools of Thought was quite dangerous, so how could Zhao Fu dare to keep someone like this woman around without knowing her intentions? Anyone who underestimated the Hundred School of Thoughts would die a horrible death.The woman heard the wariness in Zhao Fu\u2019s voice and did not seem angry at all. Her countenance did not change at all, and a faint smile appeared on her face as she said elegantly, \u201cSir, there\u2019s no need to be so wary of the School of Gourmet; we\u2019re just a small group of people and don\u2019t have any wild ambitions. We\u2019re not at all interested in conquering the world or establishing an everlasting kingdom; we just want to peacefully make food and see satisfied smiles on the faces of our customers.\u201dThe wariness in Zhao Fu\u2019s heart receded slightly. However, he still asked, \u201cHow do you know I can create that peace for you?\u201d\u201cSir, even though everyone from the Hundred School of Thoughts belongs to a School, we all still have their own overriding interests and masters. Some have our own faith, others want to realize their grand ambitions, and others simply want peace in the world. This lowly one cannot represent the entire School of Gourmet, but I can say on behalf of myself that all I want is for you to give me peace and security, \u2018Your Majesty!\u2019\u201dZhao Fu felt incredibly stunned, and his gaze became cold as he asked the woman, \u201cHow did you know my identity?\u201dThe mysterious woman lightly laughed as she replied, \u201cEven though this lowly one is part of the School of Gourmet, my little sister is a Lesser Arbiter of Fate of the School of Yin Yang\u2019s Five Elements Branch. As such, I also understand some of the School of Yin Yang\u2019s Yin Yang Techniques.\u201d\u201cYin Yang Techniques?\u201d Zhao Fu frowned. What this woman was talking about seemed quite fantasy-like, but after seeing god Kerr himself, he realized that supernatural forces did indeed exist here.Even though Zhao Fu was quite doubtful of the supernatural, China\u2019s history was quite mysterious and profound, so perhaps such things really existed.At this moment, the mysterious woman started to explain, \u201cYour Majesty, this lowly one can see that the fate above your head is a Dark Gold Dragon Light. It\u2019s a fate that only those with a Legacy have, which was how this lowly one was able to guess your identity.\u201dZhao Fu let out a sigh of relief. She only knew that he was a Legatee, and his personal identity had not been somehow leaked.\u201cYour Majesty, since you want to hide your identity, this item can help you mask your fate here, though it won\u2019t be able to hide it in the real world. Even though one cannot bring things from the Heaven Awaken World into the real world, your fate is something that remains with you. However, you don\u2019t need to worry about meeting someone from the School of Yin Yang or the School of Taoism \u2013 it\u2019s rare for them to see the fate of a Son of Heaven.\u201dAs she spoke, the mysterious woman handed Zhao Fu a normal-looking and slightly crude jade pendant. Zhao Fu looked at it curiously.[Jade Pendant \u2013 Concealment]: Description: A normal jade pendant that has been affected by Yin Yang Techniques, and it can hide one\u2019s fate.Zhao Fu felt quite surprised when he saw the description. It seemed that the system recognized the existence of Yin Yang Techniques, so those supernatural things really did exist in this world. The Hundred Schools of Thoughts truly had mysterious and wonderful abilities.Zhao Fu decided that he would believe this mysterious woman\u2019s words for now. Of course, he would only give her a position as a chef, and he would not reveal anything important to her. He looked at her and said, \u201cI can hire you, but I hope what you said is true. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being merciless.\u201dThe mysterious woman lightly nodded. From her self-introduction at the beginning of the session, Zhao Fu knew that her name was He Xianru.Zhao Fu left the matter at that and let out a breath. When he thought about everyone else still waiting outside, he went out to announce the results. He Xianru gave a smile that could topple cities and followed Zhao Fu out.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter walking out and seeing the group of people waiting for the results, Zhao Fu announced the five people who he had chosen, including He Xianru. Of course, he did not hire Huo Qing, that scammer.The other people who were rejected left dispiritedly, but Huo Qing ran over to He Xianru and said, \u201cBeauty, can you please take me as your disciple? I promise that I won\u2019t cause you to lose face!\u201d\u201cSure!\u201dEveryone, including Huo Qing, was quite surprised when He Xianru immediately agreed. After thinking about it, Zhao Fu decided that keeping him around to chop some of the ingredients and do some of the odd-jobs wouldn\u2019t be too bad.After tying up some loose ends, Zhao Fu spent some more money and made two signs. Both of these signs were made from Blue grade wood, and their color was quite pleasing to the eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Following this, he took 100 gold coins to a large building.The building was the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Zhao Fu took off his cloak and put on a big smile as he handed a few silver coins to the guards. Adding on Zhao Fu\u2019s status as a Third-Ranked Baron, the guards quickly reported to the Minister, and soon, Zhao Fu was invited in.After arriving at the guest hall, Zhao Fu saw a white and chubby middle-aged man sitting on a chair. Zhao Fu walked up and slightly bowed, saying, \u201cI greet lord Minister of Internal Affairs.\u201dEven though Zhao Fu was a Third-Ranked Baron, which could make ordinary residents respect him, to the Minister of Internal Affairs, who wielded a lot of power, he was nothing.Seeing this, a trace of a smile appeared on the Minister\u2019s chubby face as he motioned with his hand and said, \u201cSir, please sit. What matters would you like to discuss with this official?\u201dZhao Fu sat down on the chair beside him and lightly smiled before saying, \u201cThis lowly one has opened two shops in Holy Light City. I\u2019ve long since heard of Minister\u2019s illustrious name, so I came to pay my respects.\u201dFollowing this, Zhao Fu took out a small sack containing 100 gold coins and presented it to the Minister, saying, \u201cThis is merely a small token of my admiration; I hope your lordship will accept it.\u201dThe Minister saw golden glimmers through the neck of the sack, and when he received it and felt it, he knew that it most likely contained around 100 gold coins. His smile instantly became sincere and warm, saying, \u201cSir can come and visit me whenever sir wants, and I will always welcome sir here. In the future, there\u2019s no need to bring any gifts.\u201dAs he spoke, the Minister stuffed the sack of gold coins into his own pocket with great deftness.Of course, Zhao Fu would not believe his courteous words. He had already gathered information about this Minister; otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have come to meet him. Seeing that the Minister had accepted his money, he quickly replied, \u201cYes, yes, this lowly one understands. My little shops will have to rely on your lordship\u2019s care in the future.\u201dThe Minister smiled and nodded as he replied, \u201cBut of course. That\u2019s right, does sir know you can hire 10 soldiers?\u201dZhao Fu understood that the Minister was going to provide him with some benefits now, so he pretended to look confused and shook his head.Seeing this, the Minister said, \u201cRecently, some scoundrels have been making trouble, and Holy Light City has been in a bit of chaos. How about I send 20 soldiers to serve as guards for sir?\u201dZhao Fu was delighted. He knew that hiring a Stage 1 soldier for a month cost at least 10 gold coins. Hiring 10 Stage 1 soldiers would have cost him 100 gold coins per month, and now, the Minister had gifted him 20 Stage 1 soldiers to serve as guards. This already completely eclipsed the 100 gold coins that he had given to the Minister.However, this also meant that he might have to send gifts to the Minister now and then. Zhao Fu had no other choice though \u2013 if one wanted to do well, one had to get along with officials or even become friends with them.\u201cI\u2019ll have to thank your lordship then,\u201d Zhao Fu said. After chatting for a bit longer, he put on his cloak and took the 20 soldiers to his restaurant.By the time they arrived, Zhao Fu\u2019s employees had already covered a few tables with dishes, and Zhao Fu said to the soldiers, \u201cDon\u2019t hold back, all of this is on the house. In the future, I\u2019ll have to rely on all of you to work hard.\u201dThe soldiers all revealed looks of hesitation. They were ordered to come here to serve as guards, and they weren\u2019t here to eat, drink, and enjoy themselves.Seeing this, Zhao Fu smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry; just take this as an order from me. There\u2019s no need for you all to worry needlessly.\u201dThe soldiers looked at the delicacies on the tables and said with an embarrassed expression, \u201cThank you, boss.\u201dThe soldiers gathered around the tables and started to heartily eat and drink. They did not frequent restaurants because most restaurants around here were fairly expensive.After the soldiers started to eat, Zhao Fu told his chefs to prepare more food. After a while, he opened the doors and loudly called out, \u201cToday is the restaurant\u2019s grand opening; everything will be free of charge for residents of Holy Light City. Please come and eat however much you want! Do note that players, however, will have to pay.\u201dRight now, most players were incredibly poor and there were many of them. If Zhao Fu did not limit them, everyone coming in would be players, and the residents would not even be able to squeeze in.In order for one\u2019s business to do well, one had to let people know how good one\u2019s products were. The residents were quite curious of the strange and wonderful food on the tables. Since it was all free, they did not hold back.Zhao Fu left 10 soldiers there to maintain order before returning to his equipment store. He loudly called out that today was the equipment shop\u2019s grand opening and everything would be 20% off. He then left 10 soldiers there in order to prevent anyone from making any trouble.Zhao Fu was especially on his guard against the Zhou family. If the Zhou family was not amenable to reason and tried to make trouble for him, he would have to find an opportunity to get rid of them.Just like that, the first day passed. The restaurant did not make any money, and it instead lost a lot of money. However, business on the second day was better than the first\u2019s. Those who had come to eat on the first day had told everyone they knew about the restaurant, and many people, who were filled with curiosity, came to try the new food.The equipment store sold 400 pieces of equipment on the first day, generating a terrifying revenue of 1,600 gold coins. After selling so many just on the first day alone, Zhao Fu was worried that he would not have any more to sell in the future. Because of this, Zhao Fu started to sell some of the White grade equipment as well.In order to attract people, Zhao Fu also brought out a few Silver grade weapons. Normal shops owned by the main cities usually did not have Silver grade equipment, so those weapons drew quite a bit of attention. Apart from equipment, Zhao Fu also brought out a few of his Refined Martial Souls.Refined Martial Souls all gave different grade skills. Some people even sold F grade skills, but most of them were worth 1-2 gold coins. The lowest grade skill that Zhao Fu sold was C grade, but because they were all physical skills, they were worth around 20 gold coins.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNo matter if it were the Silver grade weapons or Refined Martial Skills, Zhao Fu did not want to sell any of them. As such, Zhao Fu priced them at ridiculous prices. Blue grade weapons were sold for 4,000 silver coins, while Zhao Fu priced the Silver grade weapons at 40,000 silver coins. The Refined Martial Skills, which were worth around 20 gold coins, were priced at 200 gold coins.In order to increase the popularity of his equipment, the signs introducing them described them as weapons from tremendous ancient battles. The signs claimed that all of them possessed powerful ancient energy that ordinary people could not detect and that these weapons were waiting for someone connected to them by fate who saw their value and would bring them to divine glory again.As for the Refined Martial Souls, the signs said that they had been left behind by ancient spirits and contained great powers. The signs claimed that it was possible for them to unlock godly SSS grade skills, but ordinary bumpkins would not be able to comprehend their profoundness.\u201cHaha!\u201d Zhao Fu was quite delighted. By doing this, no one would dare to say that these goods were fake because that would be tantamount to admitting that they were \u2018ordinary bumpkins\u2019 who did not have good taste.After making these signs, Zhao Fu\u2019s equipment store became much more famous than those opened by residents around him. Rumors about ancient godly weapons and skills left behind by sacred spirits started to be spread around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Fu was naturally quite happy to see money flow into his pockets like water flowing through a river.At the same time, he caught the attention of a few large families and factions. There were 6 large families in the Forest of Horrors, and they all wanted to make the Forest of Horrors the base for their development.Because everyone was sent to random places in the Heaven Awaken World, the large families could only gather small groups of people in the Forest of Horrors, while their remaining forces would settle wherever they had been spawned, with the family\u2019s main development being in the Forest of Horrors. They all chose this place for different reasons: some thought that the competition would be weaker here, others thought that it would be a good place to develop, and others were here because the successors of their families had been spawned here.These 6 large families were the Jiang family, Zhang family, Cao family, Yan family, Hua family, and Zhou family.There were also 3 large factions created by players: the Holy Light Group, Soldier Alliance, and Demon Tree Gang. Based on their names, they seemed to be the largest factions in each of the 3 main cities. There were also some smaller factions that weren\u2019t worth mentioning.Some of these factions were created by large financial groups working together in the real world, while others were formed purely by friends meeting in the Heaven Awaken World. Others were formed by a group of thugs led by an ambitious boss.Before, they had taken the rumor hinting that Zhao Fu was a Legatee as a joke, but they now started to have suspicions. Putting aside whether Zhao Fu really was a Legatee or not, it was clear how powerful he was by the fact that he had such an abundance of Blue grade equipment that he would sell them, and he even possessed Silver grade equipment and Refined Martial Souls.Even though opening 2 shops seemed quite simple, Zhao Fu had become a great threat.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.In the real world, Zhou Jie was kicked to the ground by his father. \u201cYou unfilial son, all you do is make trouble for me. Look at what you\u2019ve done \u2013 we can\u2019t tell how powerful the man you angered is!\u201dNearby was a young man who was a few years older than Zhou Jie. He was the Zhou family\u2019s Eldest Young Master Zhou Ming.Zhou Ming watched his little brother be kicked a few times before walking over and pleading on his behalf, \u201cFather, that should be enough. Little Jie has learned his lesson, and the situation is not as bad as you think. We have not developed irreconcilable hatred with that person, and now is the time for us to be developing our forces. The Jiang family has already obtained a shop, and they have been earning at least 20 gold coins per day just from selling clothes.\u201dZhou Shizhi coldly harrumphed and stopped kicking his son. Following this, he started to discuss some matters with Zhou Ming. Zhou Jie\u2019s face was ashen as he slowly raised his head and looked at his father and elder brother with a trace of hatred in his heart.Elsewhere, Zhao Fu was standing in front of the equipment store and hanging up a sign that requested for materials of Silver grade or above. Anyone who provided such materials would be able to trade them for items from within the shop. Right now, Zhao Fu did not lack Blue grade equipment at all, but he didn\u2019t have many pieces of Silver grade equipment.Right now, there were five Grey Dwarves in Rhode Village who could forge Silver grade equipment. Because Wang Dawu, the Great Qin Village\u2019s Blacksmith, had not forged for as long as them, he was only at the boundary of being able to forge Silver grade equipment.After taking care of matters here, Zhao Fu took some money and went to see what other properties he could buy for his remaining 7 lots of land. He took the money with him back to the Great Qin Village and then headed to Soldier Forest.This was the first time that Zhao Fu had come to Soldier Forest, and after arriving, he found that it was similar to Holy Light City. It had large streets crammed with people, and the only difference was that Soldier Forest was much more military-like.Zhao Fu went to the real estate office and bought another lot of land. Zhao Fu planned to build another Westfall Restaurant here and started to recruit people. However, he decided not to open an equipment shop here because he was barely able to meet the demand of the market in Holy Light City.Zhao Fu did not want to sell any of the bronze concentrate equipment because he did not want to make his opponents too strong. Only when he had many pieces of Silver grade equipment would he sell them.After \u2018befriending\u2019 Soldier Forest\u2019s Minister of Internal Affairs, Zhao Fu obtained another 10 guards, and he prepared to open a restaurant. Afterwards, he also went to Demon Tree City and did the same thing.Right now, he had 3 Westfall Restaurants, and after a few days, they began to bring in a steady revenue of 500 gold coins per day. Adding on an average 600 gold coins per day from the equipment shop, Zhao Fu now earned more than 1,000 gold coins per day. What\u2019s more, this was with a shortage of equipment \u2013 if he could maintain a stock of equipment, he would be able to continuously earn this much money.Since the profits were so great, Zhao Fu decided to create a second team to explore the passages in the region of bones. The team composition and skills of the team were the same as the first team: there were Goblin Warriors, Infantry, and Archers, and Zhao Fu supplied them with Holy Light type skills.What was strange was that Li Wen and his team had not finished exploring even a single passage after such a long time. It was not because Li Wen was incompetent but because the passage was simply too long. Zhao Fu had only found the original passage due to the ground caving in, and part of the passage had been buried. As such, he had no idea just how long the passage was or where it led to.Now that Zhao Fu had so much money, there were many things for him to consider. The first thing was the matter with the energy stones. It was a pity that he could not find a mine; each of the 3 main cities controlled a small energy stone mine each, and they were able to produce 300-400 energy stones per day.Just these energy stones alone would cost a massive amount of money. 1,000 energy stones cost 10,000 gold coins, and who knew how many he would need in the future?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn order to achieve his God-Refining Plan, Zhao Fu decided to go all out. He took with him Snow Fox fur from the Snow Fox that one of his teams had killed in the Forest of Horrors not long ago and headed out.The Snow Fox was an Elite grade creature. Its fur was as white as snow and incredibly soft, and it did not have any foul smells. It was Blue grade, and if one was to turn it into equipment, it would be worth perhaps 500 or 600 silver coins. However, if it was turned into a luxury item, it would be worth many times more, and it could perhaps be worth thousands of silver coins \u2013 such things were liked by rich women.Zhao Fu took the Snow Fox fur to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Because the largest providers of energy stones were main cities, Zhao Fu directly went to talk to the Minister of Internal Affairs.The Minister had been paying attention to Zhao Fu\u2019s matters over the past few days. Zhao Fu was now quite famous within Holy Light City, and many upper-class members of society mentioned his name. Of course, they weren\u2019t interested in his equipment shop because most of them had Gold grade equipment. Rather, they were very much interested in his restaurant. The food there was incredibly eye-catching and mouth-watering, and these upper-class members of society were also humans and had to eat. The Westfall Restaurant\u2019s 12 private rooms and 4 VIP rooms were all usually booked out.As such, the Minister\u2019s attitude towards Zhao Fu had greatly changed over the past few days. Now, he no longer acted all high and mighty, and he instead started addressing Zhao Fu as \u2018brother.\u2019 Zhao Fu found out that the Minister\u2019s name was Qin Nan, and despite looking very chubby, he was actually a Stage 1 expert.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This little brother has come to visit you again,\u201d Zhao Fu said as he grinned and looked at Qin Nan.Qin Nan was also quite excited because Zhao Fu would bring gifts every time he came. Qin Nan laughed as he replied, \u201cBrother Zhao, quickly come in!\u201dQin Nan enthusiastically received Zhao Fu before asking, \u201cBrother Zhao, what have you come to find me for this time?\u201dZhao Fu started off by handing Qin Nan the Snow Fox fur. After accepting it, Qin Nan gently stroked it, and based on how soft it was, he could tell that it was of exquisite quality, making him feel delighted.Seeing the look on Qin Nan\u2019s face, Zhao Fu said, \u201cBig brother Qin, I\u2019d like to buy some energy stones.\u201dQin Nan lovingly stroked the Snow Fox fur and nodded, asking, \u201cHow many would you like to buy?\u201d\u201c1,000!\u201d Zhao Fu replied.Qin Nan was given a big fright by the large figure. 1,000 energy stones 10,000 gold coins, so how could Zhao Fu have so much money? However, after thinking about it, he realized that just a few days of revenue from all of his shops would cover that amount of money. Even though Zhao Fu most likely had enough money, Qin Nan still felt quite troubled because it was not easy to obtain such things.Energy stones were one of the most important and precious items, and many people wanted to buy them. Normally, the main cities only kept a portion of what they mined and sold the rest, which was why there were not that many energy stones in shops.Qin Nan sank into deep thought before replying, \u201cBrother Zhao, I can sell you 50 energy stones at most each day. Because it isn\u2019t much, I\u2019ll give you a discount and only charge you 8 gold coins for each of them.\u201dZhao Fu nodded. If he was able to buy 50 energy stones per day, it would take him 20 days to gather the amount he needed. He was not in a rush to carry out the God-Refining Plan because there were many other things that he needed to prepare and spend his money on.Seeing Zhao Fu agree, Qin Nan felt quite relieved.\u201cBig brother Qin, I have some matters to take care of, so I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d After concluding the matter, Zhao Fu decided to leave.Qin Nan smiled and said, \u201cBrother Zhao, feel free to come over whenever you\u2019re free!\u201d\u201cOf course, of course!\u201d Zhao Fu replied before leaving.Right now, Zhao Fu still had 4,680 gold coins. He started to go through the large shops, and even though there were many things that he needed to buy, there were very few things that caught his eye. He bought a pill recipe for Spring Return Pills, which could quickly heal injuries, and a few Silver grade materials. Apart from those things, there was not much else that he was interested in.After returning to the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu gave the materials and pill recipe to his subordinates. After taking care of most of the things that required his attention, he thought about his promise to Liu Mei and Asani. As such, he called them over and handed them a large cloak each.\u201cLiu Mei, you\u2019d better not make any trouble for me. If you do, I won\u2019t agree to any of your requests in the future,\u201d Zhao Fu said to Liu Mei.\u201cOkay, okay, I understand,\u201d Liu Mei said slightly unhappily. She dragged Zhao Fu off towards the teleportation channel and Asani excitedly ran behind them.Following this, the 3 of them were sent to Holy Light City. Liu Mei couldn\u2019t help but laugh in excitement when she saw so many people and all sorts of interesting and pretty goods on display, causing many people to look over at her. Zhao Fu nudged her, indicating for her to restrain herself.This was also the first time that Asani had encountered such a scene, and she couldn\u2019t help but feel excited. However, facing so many people, she couldn\u2019t help but feel scared, and she pulled at Zhao Fu\u2019s cloak.At this moment, Liu Mei saw a candymaker and excitedly pulled Asani over. Seeing them in such high spirits, Zhao Fu slightly smiled and followed them.\u201cHow much are these?\u201dLiu Mei asked the player making the candy as she held a mouse made out of candy.The player was a middle-aged man and also a candymaker in real life. However, his business in the real world was quite mediocre, so he had the idea of bringing his trade into the Heaven Awaken World. Unexpectedly, it was extremely popular, and he earned quite a lot from it.\u201cThat one\u2019s only 3 copper coins,\u201d the candymaker replied.Liu Mei didn\u2019t have any money on her, so she looked back at Zhao Fu. Zhao Fu understood, and he took out a few copper coins and handed it to the candymaker before telling Asani to choose one as well.Asani chose a tabby cat shaped candy, and when Asani saw Liu Mei lick her candy, she also extended her little pink tongue and lightly licked the candy. It was quite sweet, making her quite excited. As a result, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh, and her clear and pure laughter made everyone around her feel quite happy as well.At this moment, Liu Mei discovered something else and pulled Asani over, and Zhao Fu slowly followed behind them.Afterwards, they bought quite a few things. Liu Mei was then attracted over by a clothing store, and she dragged Asani and Zhao Fu over.Jiang Rou was in the store, and when she saw three cloaked figures walk in, one of whom she was quite familiar with, she called out, \u201cZhao Xin!\u201dIndeed, this clothing shop was the one opened by the Jiang family. Hearing Jiang Rou\u2019s voice, Zhao Fu nodded in response.Jiang Rou walked over and said happily, \u201cWho would have thought that such a busy person like you would have time to come to my shop!\u201d\u201cSorry, there have been many things to take care of, so I haven\u2019t had the chance to visit,\u201d Zhao Fu said apologetically. In actuality, he had never planned to come visit.At this moment, Jiang Rou noticed that the hand holding onto Zhao Fu\u2019s was clearly not a man\u2019s hand, and she asked curiously, \u201cThey are\u2026?\u201dIn response, Zhao Fu decided to reply, \u201cThey\u2019re my friends!\u201d\u201cHello!\u201d Liu Mei laughed as she greeted Jiang Rou before dragging Asani over to pick out clothes for them.\u201cThank you, Zhao Xin, for helping me buy this shop. This has finally given me the opportunity to take a breath and decide my own fate,\u201d Jiang Rou said with sincere gratitude as she gently looked at Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu knew that even though Jiang Rou was part of the main family, she was the third in her family and would not be able to inherit the Jiang family. As such, her only use was to be a tool to ally the Jiang and Zhou families through marriage.She clearly did not want to be married to Zhou Jie, but from her family\u2019s pressure and Zhou Jie clinging onto her every day, she truly felt as if she could not breathe. Now that she had this shop, she became very valuable to the Jiang family and had more power.Zhao Fu sympathized with her and lightly shook his head, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The main thing is your Seven Arts Weaving Technique, which has made your business possible.\u201d\u201cI still need to thank you though!\u201d Jiang Rou said determinedly.Seeing Jiang Rou insist so persistently, he did not say anything. At this moment, Liu Mei pulled him to the side and asked him which outfit looked better. As such, Zhao Fu could only apologize to Jiang Rou and allow himself to be dragged over by Liu Mei.Following this, with Zhao Fu\u2019s help, Liu Mei and Asani chose a few pieces of clothing. Zhao Fu wanted to pay, but Jiang Rou adamantly refused, so Zhao Fu did not insist on it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFinally, Zhao Fu, Liu Mei, and Asani returned to the Great Qin Village. Liu Mei and Asani were incredibly happy from their outing and felt quite satisfied. Suddenly, a chain of system announcements sounded out in Zhao Fu\u2019s mind.\u201cSystem announcement! Congratulations, your village has levelled up to an Advanced Village.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! Congratulations, you have received the acknowledgment of the heavens and the earth, and the special structure [Heaven Prayer Platform] has been unlocked.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! The Great Qin\u2019s Nation Fate has awakened, and your people\u2019s fates have been blessed.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement!

Even the sky seemed to be pierced by it.BOOM!!!!As the black light stabbed into the sky, another shocking explosion sounded out. The black light turned into a black pillar of light, and in that instant, the wind and clouds froze; the sun dimmed; and the black pillar of light gave off a terrifying aura.The blue sky was dyed black, and black wisps of air started to rise from the ground.The black wisps of air looked like long dragons and shined with a crystalline light. After rising from the ground, they ascended towards the sky. All of Great Qin\u2019s villagers seemed to be drawn innately to this spectacle, and they started to kneel on the ground. Bai Qi and Li Si were no exception, and they too kneeled on the ground with an emotional look in their eyes.Black clouds started to slowly form in the sky, forming a cloud layer that covered the surrounding 1,000-kilometer radius area. Those black clouds were not the same as normal thunderclouds. They were a pure black color and gave off a black light that seemed to want to devour everything.From a distance, it seemed as if the entire sky was covered by those black clouds. One couldn\u2019t help but feel as if apocalyptic lightning was about to descend, making one\u2019s hairs stand on end and fear to take root in one\u2019s heart.All living creatures under the sky felt an aura of suppression, and it was as if their hearts were grasped by a pair of large hands, making it difficult for them to breathe.\u201cROARRRRR!\u201d Suddenly, the powerful cry of a dragon sounded out, shaking the heavens and the earth. A berserk and domineering black dragon appeared amidst the black grounds, giving off the airs of an emperor.A pure-looking woman in white in Holy Light City, a man donned in armor in Soldier Forest, an elder in a green robe in Demon Tree City, and a 1,000-metre-long flood dragon with dark scales and 6 blood-red eyes in the depths of the Forest of Horrors all stared into the distance with surprise at where Zhao Fu was.At other places, Great Xia\u2019s Legatee, Si Ji; Great Shang\u2019s Legatee, Di Wutian; Great Zhou\u2019s Legatee, Ji Shenming; and Great Han\u2019s Legatee, Liu Ye, also stared in Zhao Fu\u2019s direction with surprise.At this moment, above the Great Qin Village, a massive, savage dragonhead within the black clouds slowly emerged, and it gave off an overbearing and domineering intent as it looked down at Zhao Fu.Everything had happened incredibly quickly, and Zhao Fu was at a loss as to what was going on. However, he realized that this was the Great Qin\u2019s true Legacy \u2013 this was Great Qin receiving the acknowledgment of the heavens and the earth.Zhao Fu lightly breathed out and closed his eyes, slowly spreading out his hands. A dark-gold robe with dragons embroidered on it slowly descended from the sky and lightly fell on his body. A dark-gold dragon crown also appeared and descended onto his head.As all of this happened, bricks started to appear beneath his feet, slowly raising him up until a stone platform that was 18 meters tall and 9 meters wide appeared beneath him.Zhao Fu was in the center of the platform with his eyes slightly closed. With his arms spread out and the black-gold dragon robe and the black-gold dragon crown on him, he gave off the airs of an Emperor.Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!The sound of 12 swords clanging together suddenly sounded out, and it seemed to tear through the clouds, giving off a shocking aura. A tempest started brewing from this aura, and it spread out from the Great Qin Village. It seemed as if a disaster was about to occur, and sand and stones were blown into the air, destroying countless trees.At this moment, 12 gigantic bronze men appeared in the sky, and each of them was around 100 meters tall. Their gazes were cold and all of them held a sword that pointed towards the sky, giving off boundless killing intent. The air in the surrounding 100-kilometer radius area seemed to freeze, and countless living creatures started to tremble.At this moment, a multicolored light shined as the savage black dragon flew downwards and entered Zhao Fu\u2019s body.Immediately, a powerful aura exploded out from Zhao Fu\u2019s body. This aura was filled with dignity, might, and a domineering sense that he controlled everything under the heavens.Under this mighty aura, Liu Mei and Asani, who were next to the stone platform, kneeled down, pressing their foreheads against the ground. Their faces were incredibly pale, and their bodies trembled \u2013 they had never felt such fear before, and it was as if they had been pushed to the boundary between life and death. As the saying went, \u2018A commoner\u2019s fury results in blood splattering five feet; the Son of Heaven\u2019s fury results in corpses for a hundred miles.\u2019 This was the majesty of an Emperor.Luckily, this aura gradually disappeared and the abnormal sign in the sky also vanished. Only then were Liu Mei and Asani able to relax, their bodies covered with sweat as they powerlessly lay on the ground. The 12 bronze giants turned into 12 bronze lights before flying over to Zhao Fu and reappearing as 12 small bronze figures that floated around him.On the stone platform, Zhao Fu slowly opened his eyes. A dark light flashed within them, and Zhao Fu\u2019s appearance slightly changed. Now, there was a hint of majesty in his youthful looks.In Holy Light City, Soldier Forest, and Demon Tree City, the three people\u2019s gazes became serious, and they stared into the distance silently for a while. The 1,000-metre-long flood dragon also looked away and lay on the ground again. However, it felt quite uncomfortable and slightly shifted, moving away from where the Great Qin Village was.Si Ji, Di Wutian, Ji Shenming, and Liu Ye\u2019s blood became restless, and a sense of fear assaulted their hearts. All of them understood that a powerful competitor had appeared. They had upgraded their villages to Advanced Villages not too long ago and received their true legacies. Even though they did not have as many subordinates who were native to the Heaven Awaken World as Zhao Fu, they still had many players supporting them.Other Legatees had raised their villages to Advanced Villages and obtained their true legacies, but they hadn\u2019t made the four of them feel such fear before. All four of them realized that the only person who could bring them such fear and pressure was the Great Qin\u2019s Legatee, who had remained hidden this entire time.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNeedless to say, Great Qin was one of the most powerful and warlike empires. It destroyed the other States and concluded 500 or so years of war, unifying all of China.From the Fates of the empires, Great Xia represented the first Chinese dynasty, so its Fate was represented as a Golden Divine Dragon Light; Great Shang was famous for its divine sacrifices, so its Fate was represented by an Azure Dragon Emperor Light; Great Zhou divided and conferred different parts of China, so its Fate was represented by a Nine-Headed Dragon Light; and Great Han governed by Confucian principles, so its Fate was represented by an auspicious and gentle Yellow Dragon Light. On the other hand, Great Qin was warlike and domineering, so its Fate was represented by a Black Gold Dragon Light.Perhaps someone in later times also had a Black Gold Dragon Light and achieved great things in chaotic times, but that person\u2019s simply couldn\u2019t be compared to Great Qin\u2019s Black Gold Dragon Light.Regarding Nation Armaments, they were items created through massive Nation Fates and enormous populations. The Great Xia Dynasty had the [Nine Province Cauldrons], which could suppress Fates under the heavens; the Great Shang Dynasty had the [Star Plucking Tower], which could allow it to observe the stars; the Great Zhou Dynasty had the [Investiture of the Gods], which could be used to manage and bestow titles on subordinates; and the Great Han Dynasty had the [White Emperor Sword], which could slay divine dragons.Only Great Qin\u2019s [Twelve Metal Colossi] were armaments forged from the gathering of soldiers and soldiers\u2019 killing intent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Before, they had been somewhat happy that Great Qin\u2019s Legatee had not received the support of Great Qin because they thought that his or her development had been far slower than theirs. However, it seemed that they had been wrong: Great Qin had already started to bare its fangs at them, making them feel an incredible sense of pressure.The four Legatees stared off into the distance, unable to calm down for a long time.Within Holy Light City, He Xianru stood on the third floor of the Westfall Restaurant and looked into the distance. A violet light flashed in her eyes momentarily before she lowered her head. She saw that there was a trace of an aura around her that was invisible to the naked eye \u2013 the aura was black and looked like a dragon. He Xianru understood what this meant, and a faint smile appeared on her face.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Zhao Fu opened his eyes and opened his stats page because he seemed to have received a title.[Great Qin Emperor]: The Legatee of the Great Qin Empire and has the blessing of the Nation Fate.After looking at the description, Zhao Fu still felt quite confused about \u2018Fate\u2019. He looked himself over and saw the black gold dragon robe and black gold dragon crown. It seemed that they were not pieces of equipment because the system announcement had said that they were created from his Fate.[Great Qin \u2013 Black Gold Dragon Embroidered Robe]: Can only be worn by the Great Qin\u2019s Legatee, and it is the symbol of sovereignty.[Great Qin \u2013 Black Gold Dragon Crown]: Can only be worn by the Great Qin\u2019s Legatee, and it is the symbol of sovereignty.The items only had descriptions, and they didn\u2019t have stats. Afterwards, Zhao Fu looked at the little bronze men floating around him. He stretched out his hand, and they all flew towards him by themselves.[Twelve Metal Colossi] (White grade): An armament forged by countless soldiers that can suppress a Nation\u2019s Fate. (Note: Do not use it easily, as using the Twelve Metal Colossi consumes a great amount of Fate each time. However, it can be upgraded through obtaining a great amount of Fate).It was Fate again. It seemed that Zhao Fu needed to increase his understanding of Fate in the future. Zhao Fu thought for a moment before looking at the stone platform beneath him.[Heaven Prayer Platform]: A special structure of an Empire Legacy Village. It can level up with a village. Special Stats: Resistance to natural disasters +30%, Chances of spawning S grade or above villagers +15%.The Heaven Prayer Platform was most likely something that would only appear in villages with an empire\u2019s Legacy. It would be impossible for villages with the Legacies of normal families to have such a thing. It gave two important stats: resistance to natural disasters and better spawn rates.There were many natural disasters. In the real world, there were droughts, floods, snowstorms, famines, and more. Right now, everything seemed quite calm, but it was difficult to say what could happen in the future. As such, the resistance to natural disasters would help greatly.The second stat increased the spawn rate of S grade and above villagers. This was a stat that Zhao Fu greatly lacked. After all, the Great Qin Village had not spawned a single S grade villager yet. It was evident just how rare S grade villagers were.After looking at these stats, Zhao Fu slowly walked down the Heaven Prayer Platform. Since it was his first time wearing the Dragon Robe and Dragon Crown, he was not very used to it.After walking down the steps and seeing Liu Mei and Asani on the ground, he quickly went to help them up and gently asked them, \u201cAre you hurt?\u201dLiu Mei and Asani shook their heads, but their faces were still pale. They still had not recovered from experiencing the terrifying might of an Emperor.\u201cCongratulations, Your Majesty! Felicitations, Your Majesty! You\u2019ve obtained a Fate Legacy!\u201d Li Si and a group of people came out with big smiles on their faces. They paid their respects to Zhao Fu before he could even speak.Zhao Fu also slightly smiled and nodded before instructing them to take Liu Mei and Asani to rest. He went to the Village Hall and looked at the City Heart. After stretching out his hand, the Twelve Metal Colossi automatically flew to the City Heart\u2019s side.Seeing this, Zhao Fu returned to the real world and searched up \u2018Fate.\u2019 He found that it was linked to one\u2019s destiny and life.The ancient text \u2018Curtailing Excursions Essay\u2019 noted, \u201cI feel blessed by the harmony of Fate; I delight in the outcome of the work of time. Fate is luck, and luck is Fate.\u201d The author of the \u2018Dream Pool Essays\u2019 stated, \u201cIn smaller matters, like a person\u2019s health and lifespan, he or she will become stronger or weaker according to his or her Fate.\u201dThese ancient texts were expressing that one\u2019s circumstances, whether it was someone of noble birth or a commoner or if it was a single person or an entire nation, was dependent on his or her Fate. This profound and mysterious concept decided the destiny of a person or a country. When one\u2019s Fate was strong, everything would go smoothly for him or her; when it was weak, even simple matters would become near-impossible.After coming to this understanding, Zhao Fu realised how important Fate was. Even though Fate may have been quantified in the Heaven Awaken World, it was still something that truly existed \u2013 it was something that was always close to him but could not be touched.After reading up on Fate, Zhao Fu went onto the Heaven Awaken World forum to see if there was any news. He found that a power that had remained silent this entire time, which had been watched by countless factions, had finally started moving. It was modern China.In terms of Legacies, the Legacy of modern China could not be compared to even that of a large family\u2019s. After all, those from large families could at least obtain a blue cube from their ancestor\u2019s Legacy. However, modern countries were unable to obtain any legacies.Things were not too bad for modern China because there were others in worse states. For example, the United States had only been around for 200 or so years and was a relatively newer country. As such, it did not have any Legacies within the Heaven Awaken World. Most countries had long histories, so they could inherit some ancient Legacies.In terms of Legacies, the United States, which was a modern superpower, suddenly became one of the weakest factions. In the real world, the United States madly used money to buy anything it could use to barely keep themselves afloat in the Heaven Awaken World.Among the modern countries, the one that was doing the best was modern China. After all, much of the world\u2019s development during ancient times was due to China, and it was only during recent times that China had gradually fallen behind. As such, it could be said that China was the strongest battle region in the Heaven Awaken World.In actuality, China had been split by countless large families, but China\u2019s backbone still existed. In terms of Legacies, it could not compare to a large family\u2019s, but in terms of resources, there was no family that could compare to it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChina did not care about what happened in the Heaven Awaken World, but it required everyone to maintain order in the real world. All the various factions did their best to comply with this because it was not in anyone\u2019s interests for the real world to descend into chaos as well.As such, China seemed to ignore the Heaven Awaken World, but this was not necessarily the case. There seemed to be signs of China\u2019s military appearing here and there \u2013 this was clearly China developing in the Heaven Awaken World in secret, and its might was shocking.China had wanted to develop in secret, allowing the large families to fight each other to the death before destroying them all and establishing modern China in the Heaven Awaken World. However, China had never expected that it would be discovered so quickly.One of the higher-ranked generals made a statement about patriotism, supporting one\u2019s country, and creating a peaceful future.\u201cA peaceful future?\u201d Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Such a thing was impossible in the Heaven Awaken World. The future would only be filled with chaotic fighting, death, rivers of blood, and mountains of corpses.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now that he was Ying Xi\u2019s pawn, he had gained many benefits. In order to ensure his safety, he did not even have to go outside, nor did he have to worry about poison because there were strict systems in place to prevent food from being poisoned.After eating, Zhao Fu returned to the Heaven Awaken World.He was just in time to see today\u2019s villagers spawn. At the Origin, a golden light flashed as a system announcement congratulated him for spawning an SS grade villager. Zhao Fu was delighted and quickly went to look at that villager.The Great Qin Village was now an Advanced Village, and it spawned between 45-50 people per day. The SS grade villager was a fair-skinned youth.Name: Xia MingGrade: SSTitle: NoneProfession: [Merchant]Achievement Points: Commoner (0/200)Race: HumanAge: 22 (100)Loyalty: 80Stats: Strength: 6, Intelligence: 10, Constitution: 8, Agility: 7Cultivation: Stage 0Cultivation Technique:Skills: [Management]Equipment: Coarse Cloth Clothes, Cloth Shoes, Coarse Cloth PantsAfter looking through his stats, Zhao Fu chatted with the new villager for a while. Even though Xia Ming\u2019s stats weren\u2019t suited for the army, he was skilled at business management. At the same time, he was also a Merchant and had the [Management] skill, so he would be able to manage Zhao Fu\u2019s businesses for him in the future.Business was booming for all of Zhao Fu\u2019s businesses in the main cities, but he was incredibly busy and lacked managerial experience, so it had become quite a mess for him. He decided to hand these businesses to Xia Ming to manage; he should be able to take good care of them.The first high-grade villager that the Great Qin Village had spawned was SS grade, not S grade. Perhaps it was because the Great Qin Village had not spawned an S grade or above villager this entire time, and now that he had unlocked the Nation Fate and the Heaven Prayer Platform, the Great Qin Village had finally spawned an SS grade villager.Following this, Bai Shan came over with an excited look on his face to report that they had finished researching the Corpse Examination skill._\u201cIs this the benefit of \u2018Fate?\u2019 So many lucky things have happened in such a short period of time_.\u201d Zhao Fu was overjoyed and followed Bai Shan to the Research Workshop, and when he arrived, he saw that there was a new stone stele.Zhao Fu put his hand on it and obtained the F grade skill [Corpse Examination].After learning the skill, Zhao Fu used it on a dead chicken nearby.\u201cSystem announcement! You have successfully used Corpse Examination. The grade of this corpse is F grade.\u201dThis proved that the Corpse Examination skill truly worked. Because of this, the Great Qin Village\u2019s development would be greatly enhanced in the future. Zhao Fu planned to nurture many high-grade soldiers for the future. Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but lightly laugh when he thought about his soldiers sweeping across battlefields completely unhindered.Seeing how happy Zhao Fu looked, Bai Shan also felt quite ecstatic. He then asked, \u201cYour Majesty, what would you like us to research next?\u201dZhao Fu thought about it and decided to have them research languages. He currently had subordinates of many different races, and there would be more joining him in the future. Because they all spoke different languages, communication was quite a hassle, so Zhao Fu wanted them to research languages to help with communication between races.Bai Shan obeyed and went to start working.Zhao Fu did not stick around and left the Research Workshop. He suddenly realized that he had not yet looked at the Great Qin Village\u2019s stats after it became an Advanced Village, so he went to the Village Hall.Village Name: Great Qin Village (Legendary)Level: Advanced (340/150,000)Village Area: 15 square kilometers.Village Territory: 750 square kilometers.Residents: 8,950/36,000Military: 4,340/12,000Popular Support: 80Village Special Stats: Territory Crop Output +50%, Territory Crop Growing Time -50%, Population Limit +30%, Residents\u2019 stats can randomly +3, Soldiers\u2019 stats +3%, Population Attraction +40%, chances of attracting higher grade population +40%Subsidiary Village Limit: 24Subordinate Villages: Logue Village, Jean Village, Dorun Village, Li Family Village, Wolf Village, Ferocious Tiger Village\u2026Its stats had once again risen like how they had after the Great Qin Village became an Intermediate Village, but the number of Subsidiary Villages increased by 3 times to a total of 24 villages.Zhao Fu already had 20 villages, and over the past few days, his two teams had continued exploring the Forest of Horrors and had conquered another four Basic Villages, so he had exactly 24 villages now.However, the EXP required to level up an Advanced Village to a Town was simply terrifying. It required 150,000 EXP.Zhao Fu rose to Third-Ranked Baron a while ago and had the right to control a Town. Now, it seemed that it would still be a long before he would have a Town. Moreover, leveling up from Third-Ranked Baron to Second-Ranked Baron required 3,000 Achievement Points.Zhao Fu temporarily called back his two exploration teams. He reorganized them and expanded them to have 2,000 members each. He gave them the Corpse Examination skill, and he also gave each of the generals a spatial ring to bring back many corpses.Of course, they would not bring back corpses with ordinary grades. Since S grade and above corpses were quite rare, Zhao Fu decided that the minimum would be grade A.Today was also the day for harvesting Little Spirit Grass. Because they had obtained more and more people, the rate at which they had planted Little Spirit Grass had also greatly increased.After harvesting all of the Little Spirit Grass, they refined more than 90,000 Little Spirit Pills. Each of the 4,000 or so soldiers received 20 or so Little Spirit Pills for the month. Since the area devoted to Little Spirit Grass was rapidly increasing, it seemed that everyone would be able to obtain at least 20 Little Spirit Pills every month.Now, Zhao Fu truly understood the importance of Fate \u2013 everything went incredibly smoothly, and he had never felt so lucky before.After dealing with all of the matters in the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu took Xia Ming to Holy Light City and gave him the authority to manage all of his businesses.\u201cYour Majesty, congratulations on obtaining the Fate of Heaven and Earth,\u201d a voice said to Zhao Fu while he was walking around to see what he could find.Zhao Fu frowned and turned around to look at He Xianru, who still gave off a mysterious aura, and asked, \u201cHow did you know about this?\u201dHe Xianru lightly smiled as she replied, \u201cYour Majesty, have you forgotten already that this lowly one is skilled at Yin Yang Techniques? Of course, I would know of such a thing.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu realized that she had most likely seen the Fate about him and nodded before saying, \u201cIn the future, don\u2019t call me \u2018Your Majesty\u2019 in public \u2013 call me \u2018boss\u2019 or by my name!\u201dHe Xianru did not mind Zhao Fu\u2019s wariness and smiled as she replied, \u201cI\u2019ll just call you \u2018Zhao\u2019 then. Also, if there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand about \u2018Fate,\u2019 you can ask this lowly one to explain it to you.\u201dZhao Fu thought about it for a moment. Since He Xianru seemed to understand some Yin Yang Techniques, he could ask her about it in the future. As such, he nodded and said happily, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll have to trouble you in the future then.\u201dSeeing Zhao Fu start to warm up towards her, He Xianru inwardly felt delighted. She smiled before hurrying back to the kitchen and getting to work.Zhao Fu went out to the street and walked around. From this, he obtained some important news. There was a large Merchant Alliance in the Forest of Horrors, and it was going to hold an auction tomorrow. It was said that there were many valuable goods, and it was rumored that there would even be Gold grade equipment \u2013 just those things were able to attract countless gazes. After all, this was the first time that a piece of Gold grade equipment would be displayed to so many people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had a massive amount of money but had nowhere to spend it, and there were many things that he wanted to buy. However, Zhao Fu was not interested in anything sold in shops, so he would definitely participate in this auction. As such, he also started to make preparations.The day passed quite quickly, and soon, Zhao Fu brought Bai Qi and went to a massive building. This was the Auction House of the Red Flower Merchant Alliance.The Red Flower Merchant Alliance was undoubtedly the largest Merchant Alliance in the Forest of Horrors, and it had countless assets in the three main cities. In fact, its reach spread to even beyond the Forest of Horrors, and its background was quite profound. Even Qin Nan warned Zhao Fu not to offend it.The outside of the Auction House was crowded with people, and after hearing the 8 guards say that the entrance fee was 1 gold coin, countless players felt an ache in their hearts. 1 gold coin was equivalent to 10,000 copper coins, which was equivalent to $100,000 in the real world. This caused many of the ordinary players to dispel any thoughts of going in and even taking a look.The Auction House was big enough to accommodate thousands of people, so it had already earned thousands of gold coins just by holding this auction.Zhao Fu brought along Bai Qi and paid 2 gold coins before walking in, attracting the admiration of many people in the crowd. The Auction House was about 1,500 square meters in area. Apart from the main hall on the first floor, there were private rooms on the second floor, VIP rooms on the third floor, and Sovereign rooms on the fourth floor.There were 24 white, glowing gemstones embedded into the ceiling so that it was not dark at all inside the Auction House; instead, it seemed as bright as day.The first, second, and third floors were open to everyone, but the fourth floor was only available to the truly powerful and influential figures, so most players didn\u2019t even think about going there. Zhao Fu did not have any dealings with the Red Flower Merchant Alliance, so he, of course, did not have a VIP card. However, he could at least pay some money to buy a private room.The Auction Hall was currently packed with people. There were players and fairly well-off residents. It was chaotic with so many people in an enclosed space, and with everyone talking amongst themselves, it was quite noisy. Zhao Fu wanted to spend some money to hire a private room, but it was a pity that they were all full. As such, he could only ask if there were any VIP rooms, but they were also full. Zhao Fu was dumbfounded \u2013 there were that many powerful and rich people here? He felt the feeling of having money but no place to go, and he could only resign himself to pushing through the crowd. When he saw the iron-wall like crowd, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh and start to squeeze through.\u201cFudge! What are you squeezing in for, you poor sod?\u201d the player in front of him cursed just as Zhao Fu started pushing through.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Zhao Fu was speechless. He most likely had more money than everyone in this crowd combined, but he had been taken to be someone who had no money and had just come to watch a good show.Bai Qi\u2019s expression became cold. Even though he wasn\u2019t sure what that player meant, he could tell that he was insulting Zhao Fu. Just as he was planning to teach him a lesson, Zhao Fu grabbed Bai Qi \u2013 Zhao Fu didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble, so he and Bai Qi went to a corner at the edge of the crowd.Following this, a beautiful, alluring woman in a red dress walked onto the stage and announced that the auction had officially begun.The first item was an Exquisite Blue grade weapon. It was a large saber that gave three stat points and had a reserve price of 800 silver coins.As soon as the beautiful woman announced the reserve price, someone immediately shouted, \u201c900 silver coins!\u201dIn the next second, someone outbid him, and was, in turn, immediately outbid by someone else. The price of this Exquisite Blue grade weapon continued to climb until it was finally sold for 3,800 silver coins.In the end, it was sold for more than what ordinary Silver grade weapons would have sold for. This high price caused the atmosphere within the Auction Hall to become more intense, and everyone started to feel more excited.Of course, Zhao Fu was disinterested in this item, so he did not participate. Everyone who shouted out bids was on the first floor, and there was no noise at all from the second, third, and fourth floors.Following this, a bottle was brought up, and it contained some kind of medicinal pill. The beautiful woman\u2019s hips swayed as she walked, and she took this item to the center of the stage. Her mature curves were barely hidden by her red dress, and the large patch of white flesh on her chest caused many people to cry out and whistle. After everyone settled down, she said, \u201cThis is a bottle of Little Spirit Pills, which can increase cultivation speed by 200%. There are 50 pills in this bottle, and the reserve price is 2,500 silver coins.\u201d\u201c3,000 silver coins!\u201d someone yelled.Zhao Fu\u2019s people had already refined over 90,000 Little Spirit Pills, so, of course, he was not interested in that either. Seeing everyone shouting out prices, there started to be some interest from the second floor. In the end, the bottle of Little Spirit Pills was sold for 6,000 silver coins.Following this, the third item was brought up \u2013 it was a blueprint.\u201cThis is a blueprint for forging Everlight Armour, a Blue grade armor. Reserve price is 4,000 silver coins!\u201d the beautiful woman announced.Zhao Fu had long since obtained something similar for free. After conquering Rhode Village, his people had been able to forge Blue grade armor.Many people started to fight over the blueprint. There were many people on the second floor who were interested in this blueprint, and those on the first floor could only stand by and watch. In the end, it was mainly those from the second floor who were bidding, and the price soon reached 10,000 silver coins.Zhao Fu could tell that most of the people bidding from the second floor were players \u2013 residents did not value the blueprint at all. Zhao Fu could have easily bought the blueprint to deny others from obtaining it, but after seeing how intense the scene became, he realized that he would draw too much hatred.As such, Zhao Fu did not participate \u2013 first, this was not something he lacked, and second, since he did not have the strength to destroy others, he could not afford to be hated. If he was viewed with enmity and seen as a threat by everyone else, he would be doomed. After all, many heroes throughout history had died from a pack of wolves. There were no benefits to making enemies.Zhao Fu did not dare to think that he was the main character of the world simply because he had run into some good luck. There were countless \u2018main characters\u2019 in the world, and although a strong person could take on 2 or 3 people, how could someone defeat 30 or so people? Zhao Fu was not like an overpowered main character from a novel who could mock everyone he met and still be fine.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn reality, if someone did such a thing, that person would have long since been buried in his or her grave, and that person\u2019s enemies would come and trample on his or her grave, mocking him or her for his or her stupidity.Of course, Zhao Fu did not fear anyone; however, it was not the right time to burn bridges yet. Sometimes, revealing one\u2019s strength too early was detrimental.Back then, the State of Qin had been incredibly powerful, and it didn\u2019t retreat when facing the Alliance of the Six States. In the end, it had to let go of its pride and keep its enemies close, destroying the alliance. Since ancient times, those who laughed at the end were not necessarily the strongest.This blueprint would definitely benefit whoever obtained it, but it was only a Blue grade blueprint and was not very rare. Even if he denied someone from obtaining this blueprint, there would still be many other people who would still be able to obtain blueprints, and he would not be able to stop them.Moreover, if a faction became too powerful, Zhao Fu could pretend to be weak and ally with others to attack that faction. In the end, development was the true priority, not showing off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One of them was Jiang Rou, and there was also a young man a few years older than her sitting next to her. The man was Jiang Feng, her eldest brother and the successor of the Jiang family.\u201cThe Jiang family must obtain this blueprint. Luckily, Rou\u2019Er has her clothing store; otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t dare to make such a high bid,\u201d Jiang Feng said as he grinned at Jiang Rou.Jiang Rou lightly nodded her head and did not say anything in response. Even though they were brother and sister, their relationship was quite distant, and within the entire family, the only person who she was on good terms with was her second brother.When Jiang Rou was told to marry Zhou Jie, her second brother had opposed it \u2013 he knew what sort of person that Zhou Jie was and knew that Jiang Rou would live a miserable life if she married him. However, the eldest brother had not only not opposed it, but he had also tried to persuade Jiang Ruo to marry Zhou Jie. He tried to do this by telling her to sacrifice a bit and to think of the family.This was because Jiang Feng was the successor of the Jiang family, and if his little sister married into the Zhou family, their families would come together through a marriage alliance. This would be of great benefit to him in the future \u2013 after all, he was quite ambitious, and he did not just want to be a member of a large family. Rather, he wanted to one day become a king, and he was willing to sacrifice his little sister to do it.The bidding was completely dominated by the Jiang family, causing the other factions to feel quite glum.Within a private room, the Zhou family\u2019s successor, Zhou Ming, coldly said, \u201cThe Jiang family isn\u2019t giving the Zhou family any face at all.\u201dIf it was in the real world and these factions were competing so intensely over something, they may have yelled something at each other. However, they were nothing in front of the system\u2019s factions \u2013 yelling at each other would make them look like clowns in front of those factions.As such, they suppressed the fury in their hearts and did not say anything.In the end, the blueprint\u2019s price rose to 32,000 silver coins. Within a private room, there were two men sitting with their backs incredibly straight against their chairs, and they gave off the airs of military men. Both of them looked incredibly serious and were part of one of the two mysterious factions. One of the two men, a young man, looked at the other man and asked, \u201cCaptain, should we continue to bid?\u201dThe \u2018captain\u2019 let out a long sigh and said, \u201cThis price is too high; let\u2019s forget about it. We won\u2019t be able to compete against the Jiang family.\u201dThe young man nodded and did not continue to bid.In another room, a middle-aged man with a small beard and a youth playing with all kinds of wooden objects were sitting together. They were the second of the mysterious factions, and when the middle-aged man heard the price, he also decided to give up.The other factions were of the same mind. In the end, the Jiang family obtained the blueprint, and Jiang Feng let out a breath of relief. He was not just worried about the pressure from the other large families \u2013 he had been praying that a certain person would not act. Even though the Jiang family now had more money than all of the other families, what they had was nothing compared to that person\u2019s wealth.Jiang Feng had been filled with anxiousness from the beginning to the end, and he had been praying that the person would not be interested in the blueprint. Only when the blueprint had been sold to him was he able to finally relax.The other factions were quite displeased that the Jiang family had been able to obtain the blueprint, but they were also quite curious as to why that person had not participated in the bidding. He had definitely come to such a large auction, and he was most likely sitting in a VIP room.Who would have thought that Zhao Fu was not in a VIP room or even a private room? He was within the crowd on the first floor being squashed to death.All of the factions wondered why Zhao Fu had not bid on the blueprint. With his wealth, he should have been able to easily outbid all of them and suppress them, yet he had not made a single bid. Some of the factions decided that Zhao Fu was trying to be friendly with them, and their enmity towards Zhao Fu slightly lessened.The fourth item up for auction was a skill book, which Zhao Fu was not interested in. The skill book was sold for 6,000 silver coins in the end.Zhao Fu was not interested in the fifth, sixth, or seventh items either, so he did not participate. The eighth item was a Superior quality Silver grade material and had a reserve price of 3,000 silver coins.Everyone started to bid for it, and Zhao Fu had a slight interest in it. Just as he was about to make a bid, a girl next to him, who looked around 17 years old, made a bid, saying, \u201c8,000 silver coins!\u201dThe young girl was quite short, but she was cute-looking and had a sweet voice. Zhao Fu looked over at her and decided to give up on the material. The Silver grade material was not worth that much \u2013 after all, normal Silver grade materials cost around 5,000 or 6,000 silver coins, and only Exquisite quality Silver grade materials were worth 8,000 silver coins. Moreover, even if he had made a bid, with how that girl had just outbid the previous person by 5,000 silver coins, the price might go up to 20,000 or 30,000 silver coins in the end.Zhao Fu was a rational person, so he decided to give up on the material. In the end, the Silver grade material was sold to the girl.The next few items did not attract Zhao Fu\u2019s interest at all. However, some people from the VIP rooms started to make bids, and they were abnormally intense with their bidding.The twentieth item was 6 wooden sticks that were all 2 meters long. The wooden sticks were slightly white, and both ends were quite sharp. There were many runes carved onto the wooden sticks, making them look quite extraordinary.The beautiful woman started to introduce them, saying, \u201cSix Wood Absolute Barrier, an advanced barrier formation that can seal all spatial equipment and skills, including teleportation channels.\u201dZhao Fu became quite excited. He had been thinking about the God-Refining Plan, and he had considered the possibility of the clone of the godly spirit escaping. As such, he wanted to prepare a barrier.Right now, normal barrier formations were useless to most people, but they would be useful in city battles in the future. They could make it so that one\u2019s enemies would not be able to use their teleportation channels, and although they were fairly cheap to him, around 20,000 silver coins, Zhao Fu was not interested in ordinary barrier formations. However, the Six Wood Absolute Barrier caused his eyes to light up.The reserve price for the Six Wood Absolute Barrier was 180,000 silver coins. It was useless to most people right now, and for most of them, even if they sold everything, they would not be able to afford it. Even the system\u2019s factions weren\u2019t very interested in the item.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs such, the appearance of this item caused the atmosphere to die down, and seeing this, the beautiful woman inwardly sighed, \u201c _This item hasn\u2019t been auctioned off even after several auctions. The reserve price of 300,000 silver coins has already been reduced to 180,000 silver coins, and from their reactions, it looks like this price will continue to go down, or we\u2019ll be forced to just keep it in the Storehouse.\u201d_\u201cWould anyone like to make a bid?\u201dThe beautiful woman asked this twice, but she was met with silence. Just as she was about to disappointedly call people up to take the wooden sticks away, someone finally spoke.\u201c180,500 silver coins!\u201dThe speaker\u2019s soft voice was extremely loud in the silent auction house, causing discussions to break out. Everyone looked over to see who was willing to spend so much money for something so useless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123Everyone looked at the corner on the first floor, where a cloaked figure was standing. It was Zhao Fu who had made the bid of 180,500 silver coins.The cute young girl by Zhao Fu\u2019s side also stared at Zhao Fu with wide eyes filled with curiosity.After becoming the center of attention, Zhao Fu continued to stand there calmly. After receiving the Fate Legacy, his mental state had greatly changed as well.When many people heard his voice and saw his attire, they were able to guess his identity. They couldn\u2019t help but sigh \u2013 he was indeed quite a wealthy man. At the same time, they felt quite confused \u2013 why was such a grand figure squeezing in with everyone down on the first floor? They could only inwardly think, \u201c _The way rich people think is quite different._ \u201dThere were also quite a lot of people who did not know who this cloaked figure was, so they asked the people around them to sate their curiosity.Many of the player factions started to feel nervous when they saw that Zhao Fu had finally started bidding. No player faction had the resources to bid over 180,000 silver coins on a single item.Jiang Rou revealed a trace of a smile and left the private room when she heard Zhao Fu\u2019s voice. Jiang Feng did not stop her, and he also smiled. Zhao Fu was definitely more powerful than the Zhou family.The beautiful woman couldn\u2019t help but charmingly smile and say, \u201cThis sir has made a bid of 180,500 silver coins. Would anyone else like to make a bid? If not, the Six Wood Absolute Barrier will go to this sir.\u201dNo one else made a bid \u2013 who else could afford 180,000 silver coins? The system\u2019s factions were not very interested in this item either, so Zhao Fu obtained it easily.\u201cZhao Xin!\u201d Jiang Rou walked to the first floor and smiled as she called out his name.Zhao Fu turned to look at Jiang Rou and nodded. She walked over to his side and started to chat with him.In a private room, Zhou Ming\u2019s gaze became cold upon seeing this. The marriage between Zhou Jie and Jiang Rou wasn\u2019t something that had been formally settled by their families, and it had been something privately agreed on. Seeing Jiang Rou act so warmly to another person, wasn\u2019t this simply slapping the Zhou family on the face?Moreover, Zhou Ming understood what the Jiang family was trying to convey when Jiang Feng had not given them any face when obtaining the blueprint. Even though he was furious, he endured it because he understood the situation. Right now, his side was the weaker side, so if their families started to fight, with many wolves watching from the sidelines, it would only be detrimental to the Zhou family.Following this, another item was brought up. It was another bottle, and the beautiful woman introduced it, saying, \u201cThese are [Explosive Spirit Pills], a Stage 3 medicinal pill that can cause all of one\u2019s power to explode out. However, the side effect is that the user will feel weak for the next few days. There are 20 Explosive Spirit Pills in this bottle, and the reserve price is 80,000 silver coins.\u201dMany people were quite interested because those pills could be used as a last-resort to save their lives. However, they were not things that could be bought by ordinary players, and it was mostly the system\u2019s factions bidding over it. In the end, it was bought by Zhao Fu for 120,000 silver coins.In just a few minutes, Zhao Fu had spent 300,000 silver coins. Seeing how relaxed Zhao Fu seemed, the players around him were incredibly shocked.Following this, an A- grade skill, Holy Ring Light, was brought up. It could summon 7 angelic rings of light to attack, and it had a reserve price of 200,000 silver coins.This skill drew many people\u2019s attention. Just from its A- grade alone, it was not something that ordinary people could possess, and the \u20187 angelic rings of light\u2019 sounded quite powerful.The main people competing over it were those from the VIP rooms. The people in the private rooms and on the first floor could not join in at all, and they could only excitedly watch those grand figures fight over it.The price of the Holy Ring Light continued to climb, and soon, it reached 320,000 silver coins. People started to gradually drop out from the competition, but there were still 5 people vigorously fighting over it. By now, it had reached 400,000 silver coins.Hearing this price, everyone present gulped.\u201cZhao Xin! Who do you think will obtain this skill?\u201d Jiang Rou asked Zhao Fu in curiosity and excitement.Zhao Fu smiled and said, \u201c450,000 silver coins!\u201dJiang Rou stared in shock, and it took her a few seconds to realize that Zhao Fu was making a bid, and he had outbid the previous person by 50,000 silver coins.As Zhao Fu made this bid, countless people on the first floor looked towards him again, silently thinking, \u201c _This person is far too rich. He already spent 300,000 silver coins before, and now he\u2019s bidding 450,000 silver coins. What a godly tycoon! It\u2019s possible that even all of the player factions combined aren\u2019t as rich as him._ \u201dWithin the private rooms, the various large families and factions stared at Zhao Fu on the first floor and felt incredibly powerless.Jiang Feng\u2019s smile became brighter. By now, he had already given up on the Zhou family and had put all of his attention on Zhao Fu. Now, he was hoping that Jiang Rou could win Zhao Fu\u2019s heart \u2013 that would simply be perfect.Zhou Ming\u2019s expression became incredibly ugly. Back then, his hedonistic little brother had offended this fellow. If he became stronger, he would definitely take revenge on the Zhou family. Now, Zhou Ming felt a deep sense of danger from Zhao Fu.In another private room, the young man said, \u201cCaptain, that man called Zhao Xin has so much money, and it\u2019s said that he might be a Legatee. I wonder where his Legacy is from \u2013 China had so many empires, nations, and states, and if it\u2019s one of the lesser-known ones, it\u2019ll be quite difficult to find out if he doesn\u2019t reveal the information.\u201dThe captain nodded and stared at Zhao Fu as he said, \u201cHe\u2019s quite useful to the country. We must make him join us and work for the country.\u201dHearing this, the young man\u2019s expression became serious and saluted as he replied, \u201cYes!\u201dIn another room, a middle-aged man pointed at Zhao Fu through the window and said to the youth in the room, \u201cHun\u2019Er, have a look at that person.\u201d\u201cOkay, Uncle Lin,\u201d the youth replied as he went to the window. His eyes widened as a formless energy spread out from his eyes. In that instant, the youth\u2019s eyes turned pure-black, and there seemed to be countless gears turning within them.\u201cUncle Lin, I can\u2019t see anything!\u201d The youth looked at Zhao Fu with his pure-black eyes, but he felt that he could only see darkness.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cReally?\u201dThe man that the youth had called \u2018Uncle Lin\u2019 thought for a moment before saying, \u201cHun\u2019Er, since even your Heavencraft Ink Eyes can\u2019t see anything, there must be an expert interfering. This matter isn\u2019t simple at all, and we should definitely report it.\u201dThe youth nodded and returned to playing with the wooden objects on the table.Because of Zhao Fu\u2019s bid of 450,000 silver coins, the auction house once again became silent, and even those in the VIP rooms started to hesitate.On the stage, the beautiful woman lightly laughed before asking, \u201cIs there anyone else who would like to make a bid? Otherwise, such an excellent skill will be going to this sir!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the end, the A- grade Holy Ring Light was sold to Zhao Fu.Everyone looked at Zhao Fu with envy and admiration before looking at the next item.Zhao Fu did not make any bids for the next few items, and the system\u2019s factions started to display their might. Several items that attracted the players were bought by the system\u2019s factions at high prices.Just like that, Zhao Fu did not participate for another 20 items, and he silently stood in his corner. Everyone\u2019s attention had long since been turned to the system\u2019s factions.The auction was starting to reach its end, and the last few items were slowly brought out.The first of these items was an ore-like rock that was about as big as a fist and gave off a faint yellow light. Even though it was only as big as a fist, it required four large men to carry it up \u2013 this showed just how heavy it was.The beautiful woman started to introduce it, saying, \u201cThis is a Hardearth Rock, a Gold grade material that can be used to forge Gold grade equipment. The reserve price is 300,000 silver coins.\u201dA Gold grade item had finally appeared. Everyone stared at the Hardearth Rock with excitement and discussed among themselves, causing the auction hall to become quite raucous.The first bid was a bid for 320,000 silver coins, and it was immediately outbid by other people. Soon, the Hardearth Rock\u2019s price reached 400,000 silver coins, and those who were fighting over it showed no signs of stopping.Suddenly, a man\u2019s voice came from a Sovereign room, saying, \u201c500,000 silver coins!\u201dAfter this voice sounded out, the auction hall once again fell silent. This was the first time that someone from a Sovereign room had spoken, and everyone knew that he was a truly grand character. Those who had been fighting over the Hardearth Rock also fell silent.The cute-looking girl beside Zhao Fu stared at the Hardearth Rock, her eyes brimming with light. However, it was a pity that she did not have much money, so she could only hang her head down and sigh.Zhao Fu was also tempted when he looked at the Hardearth Rock. Even though his villagers were unable to forge Gold grade equipment yet, he could store it until they were able to.However, even though Zhao Fu wanted to buy it, considering the status and power of the person in the Sovereign room, Zhao Fu knew that he couldn\u2019t afford to offend such a person. Offending such a person over a Gold grade material simply wasn\u2019t worth it because he relied on his businesses in Holy Light City. If the grand figure could shut down his businesses, it simply wouldn\u2019t be worth it.Many people understood this, so the auction hall settled down, and not a single person was willing to make a bid.The lively auction hall suddenly fell silent, and the atmosphere became somewhat awkward.\u201cOld Wu! You\u2019re using your power to oppress others again. With your status, do you really lack Gold grade ore?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice called out from another Sovereign room.Hearing this, the man addressed as \u2018Old Wu\u2019 realized how cold the atmosphere had become and clearly and brightly laughed, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting here for so long and just wanted to have some fun. Don\u2019t worry about my status; I promise I won\u2019t take revenge if you outbid me.\u201dUpon hearing the man\u2019s words, everyone was speechless. Even though \u2018Old Wu\u2019 said not to mind his status and that he wouldn\u2019t take revenge, who would risk such a thing?Seeing how quiet the scene had become, the beautiful woman on the stage awkwardly asked, \u201cIs there anyone else who would like to make a bid?\u201dZhao Fu sighed and decided to give up on the Gold grade ore. Ruining his future earnings for an ore was simply not worth it.The cute-looking girl looked over at Zhao Fu and tilted her head as she seemed to think of something. She jumped over towards Zhao Fu.\u201c550,000 silver coins!\u201dA sweet and tender voice sounded out, and everyone breathed in a cold breath of air. Who was the suicidal fool who dared to offend such a grand figure?Everyone once again looked at the familiar corner and saw a cute-looking girl tightly hugging onto a cloaked figure like she was an octopus.At that moment, the cute-looking girl added, saying, \u201cI\u2019m his friend; he\u2019ll be paying for me!\u201d\u201c _What the hell?!_ \u201d Zhao Fu silently cursed. When the girl leapt at him, he stared at her with a surprised expression on his face, and when he heard what she said, he realized that he had been screwed over by her. He wanted to push her away because he didn\u2019t even know her, but she stuck onto him like gum. No matter how hard he pushed, he couldn\u2019t extricate himself from her.\u201cVery well! If no one else wants to make a bid, this ore will be sold to this sir,\u201d the beautiful woman on the stage said with an amused expression on her face. She was satisfied with Zhao Fu\u2019s price.Moreover, she knew Old Wu\u2019s status. To him, Gold grade material was truly nothing, and he really was playing around. Even though he was only trying to have a bit of fun, when someone of his status spoke, it always caused the atmosphere in the auction hall to die down. Now, someone had finally outbid him and increased the bid by 50,000 silver coins. She was very happy with this.Just as Zhao Fu opened his mouth in protest, a small and tender hand covered his mouth, and immediately after, another item was brought up, destroying Zhao Fu\u2019s chances of rectifying the situation. All of the factions and powers looked at Zhao Fu with a hint of schadenfreude.The girl finally let go of Zhao Fu, stood by his side, and grinned at him dumbly. For some reason, she had drool coming out of her mouth.Zhao Fu sighed and turned to look at her, asking, \u201cWho are you?\u201dThe cute-looking girl smiled at Zhao Fu and replied, \u201cI\u2019m called Gongsun Lin. You don\u2019t need to be courteous. Just call me by my name.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Fu was speechless. This little girl did not seem to feel any guilt at all, and he said, \u201cYou know you just screwed me over, right?\u201dGongsun Lin grinned and did not seem to mind, and she said, \u201cI think that uncle was really just playing around; you\u2019ll be fine. Plus, I won\u2019t take your Hardearth Rock, and I\u2019ll even forge Gold grade equipment for you. You\u2019ve made a big profit, but you don\u2019t need to thank me \u2013 it\u2019s my own fault for being such a good person!\u201dZhao Fu was even less sure of what to say. Who would believe that a girl like her could forge Gold grade equipment? None of Zhao Fu\u2019s subordinates could forge Gold grade equipment, so how could a player like her?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSensing Zhao Fu\u2019s doubt, Gongsun Lin angrily pouted, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t look down on this girl\u2019s abilities; my family is the Gongsun family, the one that forged the Scarlet Firmament Sword.\u201d\u201cScarlet Firmament Sword?\u201dZhao Fu felt that the name sounded familiar, but he couldn\u2019t place it.At this moment, Jiang Rou smiled and explained, \u201cThe Scarlet Firmament Sword is ranked third out of the Ten Great Ancient Swords. It\u2019s ranked below the Regulus Sword and the Clear Sable Sword. Legends say that Emperor Gaozu of Han, Liu Bang, obtained the Scarlet Firmament Sword and slayed a white dragon, which drew him onto the path of an Emperor. That\u2019s why the sword is also called the Sword of Sovereignty, and it was forged by the Gongsun family.\u201dZhao Fu realized why that name sounded so familiar now. It seemed that this girl had quite a background, and perhaps she really would be able to forge Gold grade equipment. No wonder she seemed so infatuated with high-grade materials.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a long spear that was a silver color. There were many delicate and fine decorations carved onto it, and the sharp spearhead gave off a cold glint, making everyone feel a chill within his or her heart. That sort of sensation made them want to stay away from the spear, which was clearly a Gold grade weapon.The beautiful woman started to introduce the spear. It was called the Hundred Flower Silver Spear, and it was a Gold grade weapon forged from Superior quality Mysterious Silver. The reserve price was 800,000 silver coins.Because the spear\u2019s stats were revealed to everyone, Zhao Fu was able to take a look. It was slightly inferior to Bai Qi\u2019s Star Slashing Sword, which had been enhanced. If the Star Slashing Sword hadn\u2019t been enhanced, its stats would have been inferior to this spear\u2019s stats \u2013 after all, it hadn\u2019t been taken care of and became rusty after a long period of timeNow, the truly exceptional figures started to make bids. Everyone could only stand by and watch, and this was the same for Zhao Fu. After buying the Hardearth Rock, he had spent all of the money that he had prepared to spend.In the end, the Hundred Flower Silver Spear was sold for 4.1 million silver coins \u2013 this was an astronomical price, and everyone in the crowd could only sigh in amazement.Following this, the next items were brought up. They were eight rocks of uneven appearance that gave off traces of fire aura \u2013 they were Fire Strengthening Stones.The beautiful woman introduced these items, saying, \u201cEveryone knows that Strengthening Stones are difficult to come by, and the Red Flower Merchant Alliance was only able to gather these eight Fire Strengthening Stones with great difficulty. They can be said to be extremely rare, and they can help equipment go through the fourth strengthening. Their reserve price is 1.2 million silver coins.\u201d\u201cFourth strengthening?\u201d Zhao Fu realized that equipment could be strengthened many times, but the number of Strengthening Stones required for each subsequent strengthening was different.With how rare Strengthening Stones were, gathering eight Strengthening Stones of the same attribute must have been incredibly difficult. No wonder their reserve price was much higher than that of a Gold grade equipment\u2019s.After an intense bidding war among the people in the Sovereign rooms, the eight Fire Strengthening Stones were sold for 5.8 million silver coins.This sort of figure made countless people look up to those in the Sovereign rooms, and they simply could not even imagine possessing so much money. However, watching those grand figures engage in bidding wars was quite exciting to watch.The final item was carefully carried up by six big men. It was a giant egg that was 1 meter long. The eggshell was a faint azure color, and it gave off a faint sense of might. Those who saw it realized that it was definitely not an ordinary egg. It was definitely an egg from an extremely powerful creature.The beautiful woman on the stage faintly smiled and said mysteriously, \u201cDoes everyone know about dragons? Even a single one of those terrifying creatures is able to cause a massive disaster. Their names are synonymous with nightmares, and perhaps some of you have already made guessed the answer \u2013 that\u2019s right, this is a Wind Dragon egg!\u201cDo you want to possess an incomparably powerful dragon? Do you want to ride it and soar through the sky? Do you want to reign above a nightmare? If you do, please bid for this Wind Dragon egg. The reserve price is 8 million silver coins.\u201d After the beautiful woman finished with her introduction, countless people were stunned into silence because they hadn\u2019t expected the egg in front of them to be a dragon egg.Zhao Fu was also quite shocked. Even drakes, which did not have pure dragon bloodlines, were Stage 4 creatures. Some purebred flying dragons were Stage 5 creatures, and purebred dragons like Stone Dragons, Earth Dragons, and Poison Dragons were Stage 6 creatures. Wind Dragons, Fire Dragons, and Ice Dragons were Stage 7 creatures, while Light God Dragons, Dark God Dragons, Fairy Dragons, and Crystal Dragons were Stage 8 creatures. Finally, Chaos Dragons were terrifying Stage 9 creatures.The above dragons were all western dragons, and Chinese Spiritual Dragons were at least Stage 8. However, they were quite rare, and there were more western dragons than Chinese Spiritual Dragons.No matter what faction it was, every faction was like a speck of dust before a dragon. Let alone a Stage 9 dragon, even an Earth Dragon would be able to cause a catastrophe for a faction.No one could have imagined that the Red Flower Merchant Alliance would have been able to obtain a Wind Dragon Egg. Putting aside how they obtained it, to be able to obtain one at all was already a miracle at this point in time.When Zhao Fu saw the dragon egg, he felt an extreme desire for it, but it was a pity that he did not have that much money. Even if he did, he would not be able to protect the Wind Dragon Egg.Dragons had extremely long lifespans, and it would most likely take this dragon egg at least 2-3 years to hatch. It would also take many more years to raise and train it.\u201c10 million silver coins!\u201dAs Zhao Fu thought to himself, someone in a Sovereign room had already made a bid, instantly raising the price to 10 million silver coins. However, that person was immediately outbid.Slowly, the Wind Dragon egg\u2019s price reached a level that caused normal people to feel despair.\u201c42 million silver coins!\u201d a hoarse voice said from one of the Sovereign rooms and then shouted, \u201cEveryone, please give Demon Tree City some face and allow me to purchase this Wind Dragon egg.\u201dThe Wind Dragon egg had already reached an astronomical price, and even the grand figures couldn\u2019t help but start to hesitate. This person had to let go of his pride and ask the people from the other two main cities to step down.A deep sounding voice said from another Sovereign room, \u201cApologies, 45 million silver coins.\u201dThis Wind Dragon egg would be important to any main city, so how could they allow someone else to take it? As such, the person from Soldier Forest made a bid regardless of Demon Tree City\u2019s plea.\u201dThe person from Holy Light City, the one referred to as \u2018Old Wu,\u2019 clearly and brightly laughed as he said, \u201cI apologize too; 50 million silver coins!\u201dWhen the person from Demon Tree City saw that the other two main cities were not giving Demon Tree City any face, the person sighed. Even though he felt quite angry, he understood just how important this Wind Dragon egg was, so he yelled, \u201c52 million silver coins!\u201dThe three factions continued to furiously fight over the dragon egg, and everyone else watched in awe. The auction hall fell silent except for those three voices.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the end, because this Auction House was within Holy Light City, Holy Light City had a big advantage over the others and bought the dragon egg for 72 million silver coins.Following this, the auction ended, and countless people left with excited expressions. Even though most of these people had not bought anything, after seeing so many valuable items and intense bidding wars, they felt quite satisfied. After going back, they could proudly say that they had seen a Wind Dragon egg with their own eyes!Zhao Fu and Gonsun Lin went to the back of the Auction House and received their items after paying for them.After returning to the Westfall restaurant, Gongsun Lin lay on a table and looked at the Hardearth Rock on the table, giggling in a silly manner to herself. She looked just like a child who had obtained a toy that she wanted.After a while, Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t resist anymore and said, \u201cYou can make a piece of Gold grade equipment now, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, my forging speed is quite slow, so you\u2019ll have to be prepared to wait for a while.\u201dZhao Fu nodded. He understood that it would be quite difficult for a player to forge Gold grade equipment, so he was prepared to wait. Following this, he prepared to find a Smithy for her.\u201cBy the way, what equipment do you want? Hardearth Rock is suited for making heavy weapons or shields,\u201d Gongsun Lin said.Zhao Fu stopped and thought for a moment. Hardearth Rock was suited for making heavy weapons or shields? None of his subordinates used heavy weapons, so it would be better to make a shield. They might have to fight with the godly spirit\u2019s clone, and having a Gold grade shield would make the fight much safer for them.Upon making his decision, Zhao Fu told Gongsun Lin to make a shield before hiring a Smithy for her. At the same time, he bought some other materials that were necessary to make the Gold grade equipment. That was all he needed to do to forge the Gold grade equipment.Afterwards, Zhao Fu returned to the Great Qin Village and gave the A- grade skill, Holy Ring Light, to Daisy. She was an Elven Priest and had high Intelligence, so she might be able to use Holy Light skills.Zhao Fu and Old Logue were both Demon Priests, so they definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to use Holy Light skills. Therefore, the next best choice was Daisy.Zhao Fu called Daisy over and handed the Holy Ring Light skill to her to see if she could use it. After he saw the skill being absorbed into her body, he let out a breath \u2013 it seemed that she could use it.Zhao Fu wanted to see how strong the skill was. Liu Mei and Wang Ergou were also quite curious, and the 4 of them went to a cliff face for Daisy to try out the Holy Ring Light.Daisy stood about 10 or so meters away from the cliff face and lightly breathed out. She closed her eyes in preparation \u2013 A grade skills were not as easy to cast as fireballs, and they required much more concentration.As Daisy closed her eyes and stood there, a faint white light glowed around her body, and her aura seemed to change, making her look incredibly holy and pure. She slowly raised her hand and pointed at the cliff face.A white light shot out from her finger soundlessly and incredibly quickly. It reached the cliff face in an instant, but at that moment, something strange happened.The white light split into two, then three, then four, and it kept splitting until there were seven rays of light, which became seven rings of light of different sizes. These rings of light were layered on top of each other and smashed into the cliff face.BOOM!!!A massive explosion sounded out as fragments of rock and sand flew into the air. Seven differently-sized rings had appeared on the cliff face: the outermost one was 10 meters wide and the innermost one was 1 meter wide. The seven rings penetrated about one meter deep into the cliff face, and in front of this skill, normal weapons were like trash.In actuality, Daisy had not been able to release the full might of the Holy Ring Light because she was only at Stage 0-5. In the future, when Daisy\u2019s cultivation was higher and she could fully grasp the skill, its might would be hundreds of times more powerful.However, Zhao Fu was quite satisfied with this already. After all, his Hell Fireballs were only able to create shallow, 1-meter wide craters on the cliff face.After returning to the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu resolved some internal affairs. The two exploration teams had now explored the 70-kilometer radius area around the Great Qin Village and conquered another two Basic Villages and an Intermediate Village. Now, Zhao Fu had 27 villages under his command.At this moment, a soldier came to report that he had found a brigand stronghold about 74 kilometers east of the Great Qin Village that had roughly 5,000 people.Zhao Fu nodded. During these past few days, he had been taking care of business matters, and now that an Advanced Village had been found, he would personally lead his soldiers to attack it.Now, the surrounding 70-kilometer radius area was under Zhao Fu\u2019s control. The bronze concentrate mine was about 50 kilometers away, so it was relatively safe. Zhao Fu brought along an additional 1,000 soldiers and took his 3,000 soldiers towards the brigand stronghold.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.A day later, Zhao Fu and his soldiers reached the brigand stronghold on a bright morning.Standing from a position above the stronghold, Zhao Fu looked down at it. The stronghold had 5,000 or so people and the terrain was quite complex. There was only one entrance to the stronghold. The walls were made of stone, and there were two big doors made of firm, tough wood. There were people patrolling both on and below the walls, making security quite tight. Adding on the terrain, the stronghold was easy to defend and difficult to attack.Zhao Fu noticed that there was a strange stone platform in the stronghold, which was about 8 meters tall. It was unlikely that the people in the stronghold had built it out of boredom, so Zhao Fu kept it in mind.Next, they started to discuss tactics on how to take down the stronghold. Zhao Fu and his close subordinates gathered around and discussed possible ideas. The stronghold only had a single entrance, so Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers would not be able to infiltrate the stronghold, ruling poison out.Moreover, it seemed that the stronghold had a lot of food stored up, so not many people went hunting. They only sent out small teams to bring back meat, so they could not rely on that either.It seemed that Zhao Fu had to think of a way to lure most of the brigands out. After thinking about it, Zhao Fu decided to send all 350 of his Goblins to pretend to attack the stronghold. Of course, they would not actually go too close because Advanced Villages all had Shieldbearers and Archers. If his Goblins attacked the stronghold, his casualties would be quite great.However, just as they were about to carry out the plan, some soldiers came to report that they had caught a few suspicious people. Hearing this, Zhao Fu went to have a look.Following this, a few youths in tattered clothing were brought over, and Zhao Fu looked at them as he asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201dMost of these people seemed quite frightened, but there was one who remained calm and looked at Zhao Fu while asking, \u201cSir, are you thinking about attacking this brigand stronghold?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu nodded. Seeing this, the others looked quite delighted.At this moment, the calm youth respectfully saluted Zhao Fu and said with eyes full of hatred, \u201cThis lowly one is called Xiao Jian, and I am the son of the Hundred Flower Village\u2019s Village Chief. Our village was an Intermediate Village not too far away from here. However, three days ago, we were attacked by these evil brigands, and many of us were killed. The women were either raped and killed or taken to the stronghold to serve as tools. Sir, please help us take revenge.\u201dThe youth and the others knelt on the ground and heavily kowtowed on the ground.After listening to the youth, Daisy and Liu Mei were completely furious, and even Bai Qi\u2019s expression became cold.Zhao Fu\u2019s expression remained calm. He knew from the beginning that this world would be split into the strong and the weak, and the strong would be able to do whatever they wanted. As such, one should not expect one\u2019s enemies to be merciful towards one; if Zhao Fu wanted to avoid this, he would have to become strong himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he asked, \u201cWas it just you guys who were able to escape?\u201d\u201cNo sir, there were 30 more of us who were able to escape,\u201d Xiao Jian respectfully replied. When Zhao Fu didn\u2019t immediately agree, Xiao Jian\u2019s heart sank.\u201cHow many men are there?\u201d Zhao Fu asked.\u201cThere are another 21 men,\u201d Xiao Jian quickly replied.Zhao Fu thought for a while before saying, \u201cI can help you take revenge, but it will depend on you. Bring the rest of the men to me!\u201dXiao Jian was delighted and knelt on the ground to kowtow again. He then ran off and brought back 21 men who were quite skinny and had sallow skin. It seemed that they had gone through some rough times after their village had been destroyed.In the Heaven Awaken World, people spawned at the Origin of villages. However, without a village, the original villagers would become refugees and would have to look for another village by themselves.\u201cDo you want to take revenge?\u201d Zhao Fu asked the men.Even though these people had sallow skin and were in a pitiful state, they could not mask their hatred and said together, \u201cYes!\u201dZhao Fu nodded and said, \u201cGive each of them an iron sword.\u201dThe soldiers nearby obeyed and handed each of the men an iron sword. Xiao Jian and the others understood what was to happen \u2013 they would follow this sir and attack the stronghold together to take revenge.However, what came next left them completely speechless. The soldiers actually took off all of their good quality equipment and rolled around on the ground. The heroic-looking soldiers now looked like refugees, and they picked up wooden sticks to use as weapons and wooden planks to serve as shields.\u201cZhang Dahu, you lead this team and act according to the plan!\u201d Zhao Fu ordered.Zhang Dahu loudly yelled, \u201cRoger!\u201d After seeing how stunned Xiao Jian and the others looked, he loudly laughed before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dXiao Jian still did not know what was going on. Why didn\u2019t they take their equipment? Why were they instead going like this? Moreover, there were only 700 or so of them, so how could they defeat 5,000 brigands in a place that was easy to defend and difficult to attack? As such, Xiao Jian couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cSir, are we really going to attack the stronghold like this?\u201dZhang Dahu grinned and was about to explain the plan when Zhao Fu stopped him. He lightly smiled and said to Xiao Jian, \u201cSince you want to take revenge, bring out all of your courage and fury and stain your hands with the blood of your enemies. Isn\u2019t that what brings the most joy?\u201dXiao Jian thought back to the tragedy that had happened to the Hundred Flower Village and felt a white-hot fury within his heart. He once again kowtowed to Zhao Fu and said, \u201cIf we die, please take care of our elderly, women, and children. We will repay sir in the next life!\u201dAfter saying this, Xiao Jian took the other 20 or so men and left with Zhang Dahu and his 700 soldiers.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Within the stronghold.\u201cEmergency! Emergency! There are enemies attacking our stronghold!\u201d someone cried, shocking everyone.Three big men walked out from the main hall. These men were the three leaders of the stronghold, and they took many brigands to the entrance of the stronghold. They saw less than 800 people holding what seemed to be wooden sticks, yet they wanted to attack their stronghold. As such, they couldn\u2019t help but coldly laugh.\u201cWang Xiong, Wang Long, and Wang Bao, I want you to pay for the Hundred Flower Village\u2019s 800 residents lives with your own!\u201d Xiao Jian rushed to the front and hatefully stared at the three big men on the walls as he screamed.Seeing Xiao Jian, one of the three men said, \u201cIt\u2019s that boy from the Hundred Flower Village. He was able to escape last time, and he gathered quite a lot of refugees to attack our stronghold. We tried to get his big sister to serve big brother, but she wasn\u2019t willing to and committed suicide. What a waste.\u201d\u201cThird brother is right. However, we brought back many women from the Hundred Flower Village, and they\u2019re all quite good,\u201d another man said as he laughed.Only the \u2018big brother\u2019 maintained a calm expression and ordered, \u201cFire the arrows!\u201dArrows flew through the air at Xiao Jian, but most of them were blocked by the wooden shields. Some people were injured, and many of the refugees seemed to run away in fear.Roughly 500 or so people continued to rush onwards. Another wave of arrows descended and a few more people were injured, causing more people to run away.After the third wave of arrows descended, less than 200 people were left.On the wall, the \u2018third brother\u2019 mockingly said, \u201cWhat a disorderly mob; we didn\u2019t even do much and most of them have already run away.\u201dThe \u2018second brother\u2019 agreed, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s right! That boy from the Hundred Flower Village must have done something to gather so many people, but after seeing how powerful our stronghold is, they\u2019ve been scared witless.\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201d the \u2018third brother\u2019 loudly laughed before saying, \u201cBig brother, we can\u2019t let that boy off this time. I\u2019ll take 3,000 brothers to chase after them!\u201dThe big brother thought for a moment and nodded, but he felt that something was off. However, considering that their stronghold had offended quite a few different factions, it wasn\u2019t too strange for people to come looking for revenge. Just to be safe, he turned and said, \u201cThird brother, take 4,000 people, and make sure you\u2019re careful!\u201dThe third brother smiled and said, \u201cThanks for your worries, big brother.\u201d Following this, 4,000 brigands flooded out from the main entrance and chased after Xiao Jian.Xiao Jian and the others started to run towards the pre-determined place. Before, Xiao Jian had thought that Zhao Fu was making them launch a suicide attack, but after finally hearing the plan from Zhang Dahu, he realized what was happeningRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn the way, Xiao Jian asked Zhang Dahu, \u201cWhat sort of person is that sir?\u201dZhang Dahu thought for a moment and wasn\u2019t sure what to say before finally replying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to describe him. However, His Majesty treats us all very well, and he is a very powerful person. He always thinks up great tactics to defeat our enemies. His Majesty possesses great charisma, and I\u2019m sure that he\u2019s someone who can create a safe place for us in this chaotic world.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty?\u201d Xiao Jian realized that the youth, who looked slightly younger than him, had an extraordinary background.Zhang Dahu did not mind revealing too much because Xiao Jian\u2019s people had nowhere to go. His Majesty would definitely accept them in the end, so he already started to treat him as an ally.Xiao Jian and the others quickly ran while the third brother led 4,000 brigands and furiously chased after them. Just as Zhao Fu had planned, they were able to lure the brigands into an encirclement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just as he was about to order his Archers to fire\u2026Swish, swish, swish\u2026The sound of bolts tearing through the air with great force sounded out. Zhao Fu brought 20 ballistae this time because he now had a spatial ring and did not have to worry about how to transport them. As such, he had brought all of the ballistae he had.600 bolts shot out from the 200 ballistae and descended on the 4,000 brigands like rain.Chi, chi, chi\u2026The bolts descended, nailing the brigands to the ground. Blood flowed down the bolts, killing almost 600 brigands instantly.The scene became incredibly bloody, and the brigands were given a great fright, causing them to panic.Swish, swish, swish\u2026At this moment, countless arrows and crossbow bolts shot out from ahead and from both sides. Zhang Dahu\u2019s people, who had been pretending to escape, brought out their hidden bows and started to shoot.Countless brigands had died in less than a minute, staining the ground red.By now, the brigands were finally able to react, and the third brother roared, \u201cShield formation!\u201dThe Shieldbearer brigands raised their Ironwood shields and formed a massive circular shield wall, blocking the arrows.Xiao Jian was ecstatic when he saw the massive number of casualties that the brigands had suffered. The time for his revenge had finally come. The third brother looked over at Xiao Jian and finally realized what was happening, and a savage expression appeared on his face as he said, \u201cBrat, I never thought you\u2019d ambush me! Your elder\u2019s going to cut you into a thousand pieces!!\u201d\u201cHaha, you reap what you sow, you evil brigands. It\u2019s time for you to pay for your crimes!\u201d Xiao Jian loudly laughed.The third brother was incredibly furious, but after thinking about something, he started to laugh loudly, \u201cYou probably don\u2019t know that your big sister was killed by me, and I was able to taste her. She wasn\u2019t bad at all!\u201dWhen Xiao Jian heard that his big sister had been killed by him, his memories of his big sister flashed in his mind. His expression froze as he powerlessly fell to the ground, tears flowing out of his eyes as his felt as if it had been torn apart.Zhao Fu frowned and ordered, \u201cSpearwielders and ballistae, prepare to fire. Destroy that shield wall!\u201dSwish, swish, swish\u2026As Zhao Fu gave the order, bolts containing immense power shot towards the shield wall.Bang, bang, bang\u2026The bolts from the ballistae were unable to pierce through the shields, but they made the brigand Shieldbearers feel as if they had been hit by a cow. As a result, both their shields and bodies were sent flying.The shield wall formed by the brigands was completely destroyed by the ballistae, and following this, the Spearwielders threw their javelins, hitting many brigands.After the shield wall was destroyed, countless arrows descended on the brigands, and many of them were shot to death.The \u2018third brother\u2019 took two arrows but was not hit in his vitals. He watched as his brigands fell one after another, and he became incredibly frantic and livid. He was determined to catch Xiao Jian and torture him to death. Who knew where he had found such a powerful force? It seemed that he would have to run.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201dXiao Jian\u2019s eyes were completely red, and his handsome-looking face twisted in anger as he roared. He gripped his iron sword and rushed at the third brother like he was mad. Beside him, Zhang Dahu tried to stop him, but Xiao Jian struggled out of his grip. As such, Zhang Dahu could only sigh.Now that around 1,500 brigands had died, Zhao Fu gave the order to stop firing arrows. The third brother started to relax when he saw that Zhau Fu\u2019s soldiers had stopped shooting arrows at him, and he started to think of a way to break out of the encirclement.Rumble\u2026Suddenly, the sound of countless hoofbeats could be heard, and the third brother turned around with a look of terror on his face. Ten terrifying Skeleton Cavalrymen led 300 Cavalrymen, who wore bronze armor and held bronze spears, as they charged towards the brigands. They gave off a fearsome aura that seemed like that of a massive beast\u2019s. As they rushed over, the third brother felt a trace of terror, and he completely disregarded Xiao Jian.Chi, chi, chi\u2026The Cavalrymen were incredibly fast and stabbed into the group of brigands like a sharp spear. They thrust their spears into the enemies in front of them, who were powerless to retaliate, and the brigands couldn\u2019t help but retreat to the sides in fear.Cavalry was said to be the most powerful type of military unit in ancient times, and it could only be countered by Cavalry or heavy Shieldbearers. Only those soldiers could stop the onslaught that Cavalry brought. The 300 Cavalrymen swept through the group of brigands like a chopstick piercing through tofu. The brigands suffered at least 500 casualties, and they were sent into chaos. Now, all the brigands wanted to do was escape from this terrifying place.At this moment, Xiao Jian and the other 20 or so men from the Hundred Flower Village ran into the group of brigands and started to slash them with their swords.\u201cWang Bao, I won\u2019t forgive you!!\u201d Xiao Jian stared at the third brother, Wang Bao, with blood-red eyes. Wang Bao\u2019s expression became savage, and because he knew that he couldn\u2019t escape, he decided that he might as well take the brat down with him. As such, he raised his large saber to meet Xiao Jian\u2019s sword.Zhao Fu rode on Little Black, a tall and majestic horse, and coldly looked down from a hill. Little Grey was lying down next to Little Black, and it was also looking down at the battle.\u201cOrder the Cavalry to continue charging and use arrows to kill the brigands on the outside of the group. Split off Xiao Jian and his people and a small group of brigands; give them the revenge they want. As for their own lives, they\u2019ll be in their own hands.\u201dBai Qi nodded and immediately gave out more detailed orders.Two hours later, the battle finally concluded. It was now the afternoon, and the sky was cloudless. The red glow of the sunset fell on the corpses on the ground, bringing about a sense of beauty amongst the death and chaos.Zhao Fu rode on Little Black, and he stepped over the corpses and came next to a body that was not confirmed to be alive or dead. The body was covered with wounds and had many deep cuts on his face. His body was covered in blood, and he lay within a pool of blood as he stared up into the sky.When Zhao Fu rode Little Black over, he weakly said, \u201cYour Majesty!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu lightly nodded as he looked down at Xiao Jian within the pool of blood and asked, \u201cIs your heart feeling better now?\u201dXiao Jian nodded with great difficulty, but he then shook his head, saying in a weak and hoarse voice, \u201cEven though I\u2019ve taken revenge, what I\u2019ve lost cannot be regained. Now, I only feel emptiness within my heart.\u201d\u201cWith how big the world is, you\u2019ll once again have something that can fill the emptiness in your heart. However, the question is, will you be able to protect it? Right now, you\u2019re still too weak. You will only be able to protect those who are important to you by becoming powerful,\u201d Zhao Fu softly said to Xiao Jian.Xiao Jian looked at Zhao Fu, who had a golden-red glow from the sunset illuminating his body. In that moment, he seemed incredibly majestic and holy, making one want to submit to him.Xiao Jian coughed up a mouthful of blood and said weakly, \u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019m certain that you\u2019ll one day be able to unify the world and create a world that is both prosperous and peaceful.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, I\u2019ll definitely make sure that my people will have peace and security.\u201dXiao Jian smiled and coughed up another mouthful of blood and grunted.Zhao Fu came down from Little Black and propped Xiao Jian up. He fed him a super-effective healing pill before ordering some soldiers to take him away and treat his wounds.Zhao Fu hadn\u2019t thought that Xiao Jian would be able to kill Wang Bao, the third brother. In terms of strength, it should have been impossible for Xiao Jian to take down Wang Bao. However, with his blow-for-blow fighting style, he was incredibly ferocious, making Wang Bao feel a trace of fear. In the end, Xiao Jian barely defeated Wang Bao, but he was left with incredibly serious injuries.This battle could be considered to be Zhao Fu\u2019s complete victory. His side had killed 3,700 brigands and taken 300 captives. Apart from the few people who had been injured in the initial charge to lure out the brigands, they barely suffered any casualties or injuries. Four people from the Hundred Flower Village had died, and the rest received quite a few injuries.The reason the battle had been so successful was because of Xiao Jian and his people. If it wasn\u2019t for them, Zhao Fu\u2019s plan to lure out the brigands would not have worked so well. Perhaps sending Goblins may have worked, but it would have raised suspicion, and the effects would not have been as good as using Xiao Jian and his people.Most of the brigands only had weapons, and apart from shields, they had barely any defensive equipment. As such, Zhao Fu did not gain any equipment.However, what was important was that there were one S grade and 213 A grade corpses. Including those who had joined him through conquest or soldiers who had been given Grade Orbs, Zhao Fu now had 724 A grade soldiers, and he had given two S grade Orbs to the Gnomes who were researching ballistae.Zhao Fu was not interested in any corpses below A grade. The 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen stood over the corpses and devoured the deathly aura, causing their spirit flames to continue growing.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Within the stronghold, the second brother mused, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Old Third has been gone for a while and still hasn\u2019t come back yet. Could it be that he\u2019s determined to chase that Hundred Flower Village brat down and won\u2019t come back until he kills him?\u201dThe big brother also frowned and felt that something was off, but he said, \u201cOld Third took 4,000 brothers with him, and he can dominate any force within the 50-kilometer radius area. There\u2019s no one who can destroy his forces, and not a single person has returned yet. Perhaps we\u2019re just thinking too much.\u201dThe big brother was quite confident in his third brother, and it never even crossed his mind that his third brother and the 4,000 other brothers would be reduced to just 300 captives by Zhao Fu and that his third brother would be killed by Xiao Jian.\u201cBig brother, I\u2019ll take a team to go find him. Old Third always acts rashly, and he hasn\u2019t even sent anyone back to report to us,\u201d the second brother said.The big brother nodded and replied, \u201cBe careful, and come back immediately if you encounter any danger!\u201dThe second brother nodded and left the stronghold with 100 brigands.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Zhao Fu ordered his soldiers to bury the corpses that he didn\u2019t want. As for their weapons, there were 3,000 Normal grade weapons, 10 or so Blue grade weapons, and one Silver grade weapon. Apart from the Silver grade weapon, all of the other weapons could be sold at Holy Light City, which would replenish the Storehouse.\u201cYour Majesty, there are 100 or so brigands coming this way,\u201d a soldier reported.Zhao Fu thought for a moment before taking many of his soldiers to surround those 100 brigands.\u201cWho are you, sir? Why have you surrounded us?\u201d the second brother said as he looked at the people surrounding his party warily.Zhao Fu lightly laughed and said, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dWhen the second brother saw Zhao Fu\u2019s smile, he realized that the situation was quite dangerous for them and quickly said, \u201cWe\u2019re from the Three Flood Dragon Stronghold, and I\u2019m the Second Master. We have 5,000 brothers, so I hope sir will spare us. Let\u2019s all just mind our own businesses.\u201dThe second brother felt quite suspicious when he saw so many elite soldiers, but he still tossed out his title and faction in the hopes that he would be able to escape and report this to his big brother.\u201c5,000 brothers? I\u2019m afraid you only have 1,000 left!\u201d Zhao Fu calmly replied.Hearing this, the second brother was incredibly shocked. When he thought of his third brother, who had not returned, and the 4,000 brigands he had taken with him, he instantly became incredibly furious. However, he suppressed that fury due to his current predicament, and he could only force a smile as he asked, \u201cSir, could there be some misunderstanding here?\u201dZhao Fu lightly shook his head.The last trace of hope within the second brother\u2019s heart was destroyed, and he yelled, \u201cBrothers, let\u2019s break out!\u201dHowever, in the next second, at least 100 arrows descended on the second brother. He was unable to dodge them at all, and he was hit by tens of arrows, turning him into a pin cushion. In the end, he died a terrible death.Thirty other brigands were also killed on the spot, and seeing this, the remaining brigands did not even dare to run. They quickly kneeled and cried out, \u201cSir, please spare us!\u201dZhao Fu smiled and an idea came to his mind as he said, \u201cI can spare you, but you have to do as I say. Bai Qi, give them each a Three Poison Pill.\u201dBai Qi took out a bottle of normal healing pills and made each brigand swallow one. Wang Ergou, who was beside Zhao Fu, held back a smile as he watched the brigands swallow the pills with bitter expressions.\u201cYou all should have realized by now that your stronghold will definitely lose and won\u2019t be able to stop us. We already slaughtered those 4,000 brothers of yours \u2013 if you don\u2019t believe me, you can take a look for yourself.\u201dAfter saying this, Zhao Fu and his soldiers took the brigands to the bloody battlefield. The ground was still stained with blood, and corpses were strewn across the ground. Some were shot to death by arrows, some were nailed to the ground by ballistae bolts, and others had been stabbed to death or trampled by the Cavalry. Before they died, they had all revealed expressions of fear and pain.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSir, please spare us, please spare us!\u201d the brigands were scared out of their wits, and they fell to their knees as they begged for mercy.A trace of a smile appeared on Zhao Fu\u2019s face and he started to tell them his plan, saying, \u201cSince you understand that it\u2019s impossible for you to win, you should know what to do after returning to the stronghold. I\u2019ll give you this bottle of poison; if you don\u2019t want to die, do as I tell you, and not only will you be allowed to live, but you\u2019ll also be greatly rewarded.\u201dThe remaining 70 or so brigands shivered and nodded. They then returned to the stronghold, and Zhao Fu took his soldiers to stealthily surround it.The outcome had more or less already been decided, and if everything went according to plan, Zhao Fu would definitely succeed. He did not have to worry about the 70 or so brigands changing their minds \u2013 after all, bandits and brigands did not have very high Loyalty, and they were susceptible to the idea of betrayal. Moreover, now that they had been scared witless and given \u2018poison,\u2019 there was little to no chance that they would betray Zhao Fu.Even if they did betray Zhao Fu, his soldiers would just have to kill a few more people. Some might have thought that they would report about what had happened, resulting in the defenses being tightened. However, the stronghold had already sent out two teams, and now that not a single team had returned intact, even an idiot could guess what had happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Where\u2019s the Second Master?\u201dThe brigands, who had been instigated into rebellion by Zhao Fu, understood that this moment would decide their futures, so they did not dare to make a mistake. One of the brigands at the front smiled and said, \u201cThe Second Master told us to come back first to report the situation!\u201dOne of the guards nodded and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go and let the First Master know.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d One of the brigands quickly grabbed the guard before signaling to the other brigands to go in and carry out the plan.\u201cWhat is it, brother?\u201d the guard asked with a confused look on his face.The brigand smiled, put his arm around the guard, whispered into the guard\u2019s ear, \u201cThe Second Master, the Third Master, and the 4,000 brothers who went out have already died. A powerful sir has surrounded our stronghold; if you want to live, do as I say.\u201dThe guard was terrified and immediately nodded to show that he understood.This news started to spread throughout the stronghold, causing a strange atmosphere to descend. Every one of them feared death, but some of them were loyal to the First Master to the death. Most of them were killed by the brigands who turned to Zhao Fu\u2019s side.At this moment, the First Master was pacing around within the main hall, feeling deeply unsettled. He couldn\u2019t help but feel that something was off.\u201cTransmit my orders! Send some people to see if Old Second has come back yet!\u201d the big brother yelled, and a turned brigand pretended to heed the orders and walked out.If this was a normal village, one would be able to tell if there was a rebellion about to take place if one looked at the Popular Support. However, the Popular Support of bandit or brigand villages were already in the negatives, so it was impossible to tell.At this moment, a brigand walked in with a few dishes of food and a pot of wine. After walking into the main hall, he looked at the unsettled First Master and said caringly, \u201cFirst Master, please don\u2019t be worried; perhaps the Second Master and Third Master will return together soon. You didn\u2019t eat anything for lunch, so this lowly one especially made a few dishes for First Master. Please eat some and don\u2019t tire yourself out, or we\u2019ll all be incredibly worried.\u201dThe First Master originally had no appetite and didn\u2019t want to eat, but when he heard how considerate the brigand was, he felt a trace of warmth in his heard and nodded, saying, \u201cAlright, put them down!\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d the brigand quickly replied as he set the dishes down in front of the big brother before saying, \u201cFirst Master, this lowly one will pour the wine for you.\u201dFollowing this, the brigand poured out a cup of wine and held the cup with both hands as he passed it to the First Master.The First Master received the cup, and without even thinking about it, he drained the cup in one gulp. Immediately, the brigand\u2019s caring smile turned into a cold one.The First Master saw the change in the brigand\u2019s expression and felt a deep sense of shock. He instantly realized what had happened, but he coughed up a mouthful of blood in the next moment. He stared hatefully at the brigand and fell to the ground, dead.The brigand coldly smiled and kicked the First Master of the Three Flood Dragon Stronghold, who had reigned above 5,000 brigands, off his seat onto the ground.With the First Master\u2019s strength and temperament, it was possible that he would have become a formidable and ruthless tyrant in the future. However, he had met Zhao Fu quite early on, and he had fallen into such a situation.There was no lack of talented people in this world, whether they were heroes, champions, tyrants, or good-doers. There were billions of creatures, and only their blood could forge the sovereign throne. The path of a sovereign was something that was created by the corpses of countless extraordinary people.It had gotten quite dark, and torches started to be lit within the stronghold. After Zhao Fu and his soldiers arrived at the entrance of the stronghold, all of the brigands put down their weapons and knelt on the ground. Zhao Fu brought in his subordinates and accepted their surrender.When the brigands saw the powerful army that Zhao Fu led, they felt a sense of immense pressure, and they did not even dare to raise their heads. Afterwards, matters were taken care of quite smoothly, and a total of 800 brigands had surrendered. Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers then killed 20 or so brigands who had unpardonable crimes and rescued 100 or so women who were from the Hundred Flower Village.After taking care of these matters, Zhao Fu went to the strange stone platform in the stronghold and looked at it.[General Platform]: Can raise soldiers\u2019 morale. Special stats: Can allow three people to change their professions to General, and soldiers\u2019 stats can randomly +1.This special structure was quite good. It could allow Zhao Fu to have an extra three Generals, and it also randomly gave +1 to soldiers\u2019 stats. Zhao Fu ordered his soldiers to demolish it, which gave him the blueprint for the General Platform, and he planned to rebuild it in the Great Qin Village.Zhao Fu then went to the Barracks and took a look at the single Profession Change Stone Stele there:[Brigand]: F grade Military. Description: One of the military units that commits evil everywhere. Effect: Receives the skill [Slash].Following this, Zhao Fu went to the Storehouse. He was only planning to take a quick look, but he unexpectedly found some pleasant surprises. Within the Storehouse, he found a dark ore.[Black Iron Ore]: Grade: Gold, Description: Can be used to forge Gold grade equipment.Zhao Fu smiled and put the Black Iron Ore, the money, and the equipment into his spatial ring.Now that he had quite a bit of money, he was no longer using the spatial ring that only had 10 square meters of space. His current spatial ring had a storage of 300 square meters, and it was the largest spatial ring that could be bought in shops. It was Silver grade and cost 400 or so gold coins.Finally, Zhao Fu went to the stronghold\u2019s main hall. He was surprised to find that it was a Silver grade village, and he chose to conquer it and [Relocate] it, netting him 100 Achievement Points and 6,200 EXP for the Great Qin Village.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe gained a lot from attacking the Three Flood Dragon Stronghold, and after resting there for the night, they returned to the Great Qin Village the next day. Zhao Fu ordered some people to rebuild the General Platform, and of the 1,100 subdued brigands, he chose 1,000 of them to join the army and split the remaining 100 or so to help out around the village.Zhao Fu and his subordinates once again brought a large number of corpses to the region of bones and used the Heaven and Earth Refining Formation to refine them into Grade Orbs. Luckily, they were mostly A grade corpses, so they did not consume too much energy \u2013 otherwise, there may not have been enough energy to refine them all. The energy stones in the jade channels from before had already been completely emptied, and Zhao Fu was already using the ones that he had bought from Qin Nan.After refining the A grade corpses into Grade Orbs, Zhao Fu took out the corpses of the three Masters. They were refined into one SS grade Orb and two S grade Orbs. The SS grade Orb belonged to the First Master, and the other two orbs belonged to the Second and Third Masters.After returning to the surface, Zhao Fu gave the A grade Orbs to the soldiers who had done well in the battle. As for the S grade Orbs, Zhao Fu once again conducted a competition. This time, the competitors were not only tested in their fighting prowess but also their overall abilities, such as adaptability and tactics.The victors of the competition were a male Elf called Yassi and a Grey Dwarf called Shandi, and Zhao Fu gave them an S grade Orb each. As for the SS grade Orb, Zhao Fu had long since decided who to give it to.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, his body was still quite weak, and there were a few scars on his face, making his decent-looking face seem quite terrifying.Zhao Fu offered to give him some medicinal pills to help with the scarring, but Xiao Jian refused, saying, \u201cI want to keep these scars to remember everything that happened and to motivate myself to become stronger.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201cThis is for you, Xiao Jian!\u201d Zhao Fu handed Xiao Jian the SS grade Orb.Xiao Jian received it with some hesitation, but after looking at it, he felt incredibly emotional. He knelt down on one knee and said, \u201cThank you for your great favor, Your Majesty!\u201dZhao Fu lightly nodded and replied, \u201cI value you greatly, so don\u2019t let me down.\u201dXiao Jian quickly nodded and promised that he wouldn\u2019t. He then thought of something and quickly took out a blueprint before saying, \u201cYour Majesty, this is a wine brewing recipe from our village; perhaps it will be of use to Your Majesty.\u201dZhao Fu took it and looked at it.[Hundred Flower Wine Recipe]: Can create fragrant and enchanting wine from flowers.After looking at the recipe, Zhao Fu decided that it could be the signature wine of the Westfall Restaurants. Right now, they were using normal wine that any village could create, so the Hundred Flower Wine would attract quite a few customers.Zhao Fu accepted the recipe and chatted with Xiao Jian for a while before a soldier came in to report that the General Platform had been completed. Zhao Fu went over to the General Platform and thought about who he would make Generals. In the end, he decided on the three people who had been with him since the beginning: Old Logue, Zhang Dahu, and Liu Mei.After taking care of these matters, Zhao Fu took the teleportation channel to Holy Light City and went to a Smithy. The guard outside respectfully saluted him, and Zhao Fu nodded before walking to the door and knocking.Gongsun Lin said from within with an annoyed voice, \u201cWho is it? Go away and don\u2019t bother me!\u201dAn awkward expression appeared on Zhao Fu\u2019s face as he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201dHearing Zhao Fu\u2019s voice, Gongsun Lin quickly ran over to open the door. When she saw Zhao Fu, she asked, \u201cZhao Xin, why are you here?\u201dZhao Fu looked at Gongsun Lin, whose face and clothes were covered with soot, and she was no longer as cute as she had been at the auction. Now, she looked like a real blacksmith.Zhao Fu smiled before taking out the Black Iron Ore and giving it to her. Gongsun Lin immediately exclaimed happily, \u201cZhao Xin! You obtained yet another Gold grade material!\u201dZhao Fu nodded and replied, \u201cI want to use this to make a large saber.\u201dGongsun Lin happily nodded and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll forge it after I\u2019m done with the shield!\u201dZhao Fu asked, \u201cHow long will it be until the shield is completed?\u201d\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d Gongsun Lin tilted her head in deep contemplation before saying, \u201cMaybe another five or six days!\u201dZhao Fu talked with Gongsun Lin a bit more, and when he saw just how crazy she was about forging, he reminded her not to overwork herself because he wasn\u2019t in a rush for the shield.When she heard Zhao Fu\u2019s caring words, her face became red, and she nodded, indicating that she understood, before running back in to work on the shield.After that, Zhao Fu left the Smithy. Some people may have been curious as to why Zhao Fu trusted Gongsun Lin so much as to even give her such precious materials.In actuality, he believed that she was someone from the Gongsun family from the very beginning because the aura she gave off was not one that anyone could have. Moreover, every large family had pride \u2013 for example, ancient forging families have forged many exceptional and famous swords, but none of them had ever used them for themselves. As such, it was unlikely that Gongsun Lin would be blinded by greed and betray him.Moreover, Zhao Fu was now a massive force among players. If anyone dared to steal his materials, that person would not be able to live in the Forest of Horrors anymore. Right now, players could only develop where they had spawned, and it was almost impossible for them to run away.Just as Zhao Fu arrived at the Westfall Restaurant, someone came to report, \u201cThere are two people here to see you!\u201dZhao Fu nodded and went to the guest hall. He saw that both people were military men with deep auras. Zhao Fu understood what was happening and a slight smile appeared on his face as he asked, \u201cHello, what matters would you like to discuss with me?\u201dThe leading middle-aged man did not try to hide anything and said forthrightly, \u201cMy name is Tang Zhan and this is my subordinate Qiu Wenjie. We\u2019re from the military faction in the Forest of Horrors. We would like you to join our military faction and work for our country. The country will definitely greatly reward you in the future.\u201dZhao Fu\u2019s smile did not change as he immediately refused, \u201cSorry, but I\u2019m not interested in joining the army.\u201dWhat a joke \u2013 which large family would join the military faction? It would be better to be a king of robbers than to be restricted by so many rules and regulations. And the rewards? Zhao Fu was the Legatee of the Great Qin Empire, so why would he want rewards from the country? Moreover, who could guarantee that the military faction would be able to unify the world? Who didn\u2019t have their own ambitions?Qiu Wenjie said with displeasure, \u201cWhat sort of attitude is that? Serving the country is a very glorious matter.\u201dZhao Fu lightly chuckled \u2013 taking glory in serving one\u2019s country was indeed an attitude people would have taken in the past, but times had long since changed. After a long time of peace and enjoyment, people\u2019s hearts had changed. Those words couldn\u2019t move anyone now, and they were instead taken as a joke.However, Zhao Fu felt some respect towards the soldiers who were loyal to their country. He respected them for being willing to sacrifice their lives for their country, and he also respected them for the effort they put in and the price they paid to be soldiers. However, if they became enemies, he would not show any mercy when destroying them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven though Zhao Fu didn\u2019t want to do such a thing, if it really came to it, he would not hold back. In the Heaven Awaken World, it was currently a very chaotic and violent period of time.Qiu Wenjie was quite angry when he saw Zhao Fu\u2019s expression, but just as he was about to say something, Tang Zhan stopped him and said, \u201cMr. Zhao, we hope that you will think about this some more. The military faction will welcome you at any time; we have some other matters to attend to, so we\u2019ll be taking our leave now.\u201dZhao Fu nodded and replied, \u201cTake care, I won\u2019t be seeing you out.\u201dAfter leaving the Westfall Restaurant, Qiu Wenjie said unhappily, \u201cCaptain, what was with Zhao Xin\u2019s attitude? The military faction put down its pride to invite him, but he didn\u2019t even think about it before refusing.\u201dTang Zhao sighed and replied, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough. Times have changed, as have people\u2019s hearts. What you said just then won\u2019t be able to win anyone over, and in such a chaotic world, I don\u2019t even know if what we\u2019re holding on to is the right thing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As such, Zhao Fu quickly went to take a look.\u201cLi Wen! What\u2019s going on?\u201d Within the medicine shop, Zhao Fu looked at Li Wen, who was being bandaged up.When Li Wen saw Zhao Fu arrive, Li Wen said with an ashamed expression, \u201cYour Majesty, this subordinate deserves to die. I didn\u2019t lead the team well, resulting in casualties this time.\u201dZhao Fu knew that Li Wen had been following his battle tactics this entire time, and he had done quite well. To have suffered casualties this time, something unexpected must have happened. Zhao Fu did not blame him and said, \u201cAlright, tell me what happened.\u201dLi Wen nodded and started to explain. His team had been exploring a passage when they arrived in a large open area that was 100 meters high and 500 meters wide. There was nothing in that area apart from a strange Skeleton. The Skeleton looked just like a normal Skeleton, and it even had similar equipment. The only difference was that it had a sword-like shard that gave off a golden light in its chest.They acted carefully and wanted to report to Zhao Fu, but they were discovered by the Skeleton. Moreover, the Skeleton was unexpectedly powerful, and normal Holy Light skills did not seem to have any effect on it. What\u2019s more, it shattered one of the Goblin Warrior\u2019s shields, and they were barely able to escape.After hearing Li Wen\u2019s account, Zhao Fu nodded \u2013 indeed, it was not Li Wen\u2019s fault. However, just what was that Skeleton? After thinking about it, Zhao Fu went to Rhode Village and ordered for some thick shields to be created out of bronze concentrate.Before, the shields that the Goblin Warriors had been using had bronze concentrate on the outside, but the inside was Ironwood. This was because lifting a shield made completely made of bronze concentrate was quite difficult for even the Goblin Warriors, so they were not suited for long explorations. However, they needed such shields to deal with the mysterious Skeleton.Following this, Zhao Fu returned to Holy Light City. Since ordinary Holy Light skills didn\u2019t work, it seemed that they needed more powerful skills. As such, Zhao Fu bought 10 Holy Hall Magic Seal skills.After making these preparations, Zhao Fu took Bai Qi, Zhang Dahu, Daisy, Saar, Old Logue, 20 Goblin Warriors, 20 iron hammer Infantrymen, 20 Archers, and 10 Elven Priests towards the place that Li Wen had told him about.The passage was incredibly dark, and walking through it took quite a long time. After a while, they finally arrived at the area that Li Wen had spoken about. It was exactly as big as Li Wen had said, and there was a Skeleton sitting cross-legged in the center.This Skeleton was quite special: the spirit flame in its head was a golden color, its body gave off a faint golden light, and it did not give off the eerie and gloomy feeling that normal Skeletons gave off.As Zhao Fu\u2019s people appeared at the entrance of the area, the mysterious Skeleton slowly stood up. Zhao Fu did not show any courtesy and immediately ordered the Archers to attack.Swish, swish, swish\u2026Arrows covered with strands of yellow aura flew towards the mysterious Skeleton. Right from the beginning, Zhao Fu had ordered his Archers to use their strongest skill, the Rock Crushing Arrow.The mysterious Skeleton seemed incredibly calm when facing so many arrows shooting towards it so quickly. It remained where it stood, pulled out a rusty sword, and lightly flicked with its wrist. A formless sword qi swept out and knocked all of the arrows away, so the mysterious Skeleton was not harmed at all.Zhao Fu was not too surprised \u2013 after all, he had been prepared for the mysterious Skeleton to be quite strong. Following this, the 20 Infantrymen launched 20 Holy Light Bullets towards the mysterious Skeleton.The Skeleton continued to calmly stand there. Only when the Holy Light Bullets drew near did it raise its sword and point it towards the Holy Light Bullets. A formless sword qi stabbed out, its powerful force causing the air to tremble. The Holy Light Bullets were completely destroyed and scattered into motes of light.Zhao Fu\u2019s expression became serious. Long-range attacks were essentially useless against the mysterious Skeleton, and at that moment, it started to walk towards them. It did not seem as savage as the normal Skeletons when seeing living beings; rather, it was as if it looked down on Zhao Fu\u2019s party.Bai Qi, Zhang Dahu, and Saar, the Great Qin Village\u2019s 3 strongest fighters, stepped out from within the shield wall.The mysterious Skeleton looked at the three people who walked out, and its body blurred as it instantly appeared in front of them.Clang!The mysterious Skeleton slashed at the three of them, its sword covered with massive sword qi. Facing this terrifying strength, the three of them didn\u2019t dare to be careless, and Bai Qi gripped the Star Slashing Sword with both hands, barely stopping the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s strike.Bai Qi could be said to be the strongest person in the Great Qin Village, and even he found it difficult to block the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s attack. From this, anyone could see how powerful the Skeleton was.The mysterious Skeleton pushed down on its sword, and Bai Qi was forced to take a step back, and he was clearly weaker than the Skeleton.Luckily, Zhang Dahu and Saar raised their sabers and attacked the mysterious Skeleton from both sides, relieving the pressure on Bai Qi.However, Zhang Dahu and Saar clearly weren\u2019t a match for the mysterious Skeleton either. They used all of their might to slash at the mysterious Skeleton, their sabers giving off harrowing saber lights. However, the mysterious Skeleton casually flicked its sword, and an arc of light appeared and knocked Zhang Dahu and Saar back by many steps.At that moment, Bai Qi used all of his strength to release a Qi Slash. His sword erupted with sword light and he leaped into the air, attacking the mysterious Skeleton from mid-air.Th mysterious Skeleton raised its sword and easily blocked Bai Qi\u2019s full-strength strike. However, at that moment, Bai Qi\u2019s body suddenly spun to the side as an arrow pierced through where he had just been. The arrowhead glinted in the light and shot straight for the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s head.Zhao Fu nocked another arrow on his bowstring. The arrow just then had been shot by Zhao Fu, and if it wasn\u2019t for Zhao Fu and Bai Qi being familiar with each other after fighting together so many times, he wouldn\u2019t have done such a thing. After all, he had used all of his strength in that attack, and if Bai Qi had not been able to evade it, he definitely would have been injured.Facing this sudden and unexpected attack, the mysterious Skeleton tilted its head, causing the arrow to narrowly pass by. However, this resulted in an opening, and Bai Qi once again used his full strength as his sword erupted with sword light, sweeping towards the mysterious Skeleton and sending it flying.\u201cHurry!\u201d Zhao Fu loudly yelled.The 20 Infantrymen, 20 Archers, 10 Elven Priests, and Old Logue unleashed their skills, resulting in countless skills landing on the mysterious Skeleton while it was still in the air.Bang, bang, bang\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA chain of explosions sounded out as the mysterious Skeleton wretchedly fell down from the air. At that moment, a white light silently shot towards the mysterious Skeleton. As it flew through the air, the light split into 2, then 3, then 4, and then finally 7 differently-sized rings of lights before landing on the mysterious Skeleton.Daisy had also appeared outside of the shield wall and had unleashed Holy Ring Light.BOOM!!!The mysterious Skeleton was once again sent flying, and it smashed into a wall 100 meters away. 7 ring-shaped craters also appeared on the wall, and the Skeleton was in even worse shape than before, looking as if it was going to collapse as it fell from the wall.Seeing this, everyone let out a breath of relief. However, in the next moment, the Skeleton once again stood up with its sword held by both hands. It lifted its sword to its chest with the blade pointing upwards, and its body gave off a brilliant golden light as it started to chant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In my king\u2019s name, I will sweep everything away!\u201dThe mysterious Skeleton seemed both holy and dignified as it recited its oath, and the golden light around it became more intense.At the same time, the aura it was giving off became stronger to the point that ripples of energy started to emanate out from its body. The light coming from its body illuminated the 5-meter radius area around it, and there was not a trace of Undead aura coming from it; instead, it seemed like a paladin reciting a king\u2019s oath.Boom!!As it finished speaking, an explosion sounded out as the mysterious Skeleton released an incredibly powerful aura, which swept towards its surroundings like a berserk wind. The entire area was covered with the golden light, and the sound of steel interweaving could be heard. A suit of golden armor started to form on the Skeleton, and a hazy body started to form around the Skeleton. Even though it wasn\u2019t very clear, they could see its face clearly.Even if Zhao Fu wanted to stop what the Skeleton was doing, it was too late. By now, the mysterious Skeleton had completely changed, and the powerful aura coming from its body seemed to cause the air to freeze. Zhao Fu called Bai Qi, Zhang Dahu, and Saar back, and then he took out five Explosive Spirit Pills and gave them to Bai Qi, Zhang Dahu, Saar, Old Logue, and Daisy.The Explosive Spirit Pills deserved their status as Stage 3 Pills. Normally, people who were not even at Stage 1 would not be able to use such powerful pills; it was usually only after they reached Stage 3 that they would obtain such pills. However, now that they had used such a powerful pill before even reaching Stage 1, the powerful effects of the pill could be clearly seen.Their eyes became blood-red, and strands of blood-red aura rose up from their bodies. Their auras rapidly became stronger, and combined, they did not seem any weaker than the mysterious Skeleton.The auras from the two sides clashed, causing the atmosphere to become incredibly heavy, making it difficult for others to breathe.The mysterious Skeleton did not look down on them, and it raised its golden, glowing sword and rushed towards the five of them. Bai Qi, Zhang Dahu, and Saar rushed forwards to meet it.Clang! Clang! Clang!Massive metallic collisions rang out, and the mysterious Skeleton seemed to be on equal footing with Bai Qi and the others.Old Logue raised his wooden staff and chanted in a low voice. The energy around him gathered towards him and turned into a small tornado, raising a lot of sand and dust. Blood-red fireballs started to form until there were 10 Hell Fireballs about the size of washbowls. As they appeared, an extremely powerful aura of destruction swept out.Old Logue\u2019s blood-red eyes stared intently at the mysterious Skeleton. It was completely caught up in its battle against Bai Qi, Zhang Dahu, and Saar, and Old Logue waved his staff, causing the 10 Hell Fireballs to shoot towards the mysterious Skeleton.The mysterious Skeleton coldly harrumphed and slashed out with its sword, causing a 10 or so meter long golden arc of light to fly out and tear through the air.Bang, bang, bang\u2026Old Logue\u2019s 10 Hell Fireballs were all destroyed, and they exploded into blood-red patches of fire, forming a sea of flames.Suddenly, countless 1 meter long wooden spikes rained down on the mysterious Skeleton \u2013 this was the joint attack of Daisy and 10 or so Elven Priests.Facing the wooden spikes, the mysterious Skeleton gripped its sword and rapidly spun around, forming an extremely powerful tornado of sword qi. When the wooden spikes descended and hit the sword qi tornado, they were reduced to splinters and sent flying.After all of the wooden spikes were gone, the mysterious Skeleton stopped spinning. At that moment, the 10 soldiers with the Holy Hall Magic Seal skills stretched out their hands. A sun-like rune shined on their hands as 10 rays of burning, golden light shot out.The Skeleton seemed to be shocked when it saw those 10 golden lights flash towards it, but it was unable to evade them and could only try to block with them with its sword.Bang!The 10 golden rays simultaneously landed on the mysterious Skeleton, causing an explosion to sound out. The Skeleton was knocked backwards and only stopped after sliding back 10 or so meters. White smoke rose up from its body as if water had been poured on red-hot iron.Even though the mysterious Skeleton no longer looked like a normal Skeleton, it was still a Skeleton-type Undead, and Holy Light skills dealt extra damage to it.The mysterious Skeleton seemed to be enraged, and it stared at Zhao Fu, who was behind the shield wall giving orders this entire time. In the next second, it shot towards Zhao Fu, but Bai Qi, Zhang Dahu, and Saar refused to let it get past them, and they once again kept it occupied.However, a powerful sword light erupted from the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s sword, forcing Bai Qi and the others back. Following this, the mysterious Skeleton once again rushed at Zhao Fu.However, in the next instant, 10 massive Hell Fireballs once again appeared above the mysterious Skeleton like 10 blood-colored suns.The mysterious Skeleton\u2019s expression became savage, and it tried to evade each of the descending Hell Fireballs. Despite this, it was unable to avoid the shockwaves from each of the explosions, and the golden armor on its body dimmed.Right after it rushed out of the sea of flames formed by the Hell Fireballs, the mysterious Skeleton was shocked to see countless ballistae bolts coming towards it.Zhao Fu saw that the Infantrymen were unable to do much, so he took out 10 ballistae from his spatial ring for them to use.Facing so many powerful ballista bolts, the mysterious Skeleton did not dare to be careless. It quickly brandished the sword in its hands and released countless sword lights, barely blocking the ballista bolts.At that moment, Daisy\u2019s eyes lightly closed, and she raised her head as a holy light descended on her body. Her surroundings were also illuminated by that light, and white motes of light drifted down from above, painting a beautiful and pure scene.Daisy slowly opened her blood-red eyes and looked at the mysterious Skeleton, who had just blocked all of the ballista bolts. When she lightly raised her jade-like hand and pointed at the Skeleton, a white light shot out from her index finger. It soundlessly reached the mysterious Skeleton in an instant, confusing it.BOOM!!!A massive explosion sounded out as the mysterious Skeleton was once again sent flying into the wall. This time, the largest of the 7 rings was 30 meters wide, and the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s golden armor shattered as it lay on the ground with its dying breath.Just as Zhao Fu was about to order his subordinates to finish it off, the mysterious Skeleton shakily stood up and raised its sword high in the air as it said, \u201cGlory\u2026 to the king!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFollowing this, the mysterious Skeleton howled. The entire world became quiet, and time seemed to stop.Boom!!!!A shocking explosion sounded out as a pillar of golden light erupted from the Skeleton, making it seem as if it was daytime in this dark area.Within the golden light, the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s expression was sacred and dignified, and an aura that could cause one to feel despair and terror emanated from its body. The aura formed a windstorm; the ground started to crack; and a terrifying aura swept into everyone\u2019s hearts.By now, the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s bones had been dyed completely gold, and a golden aura started to rise from its body like a flame. It stood with its sword raised high, and it looked like it could destroy the heavens.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the mysterious Skeleton did not even bother to look at them.It casually slashed as a massive wave of sword qi engulfed the three of them. Bai Qi and the others desperately tried to defend but were sent flying.The three of them crashed onto the ground and coughed up blood, causing their bodies to be stained red. They lay powerlessly on the ground and did not even have the strength to stand up. What\u2019s more, this was only a casual attack from the mysterious Skeleton, yet it had dealt such heavy injuries to Bai Qi and the others. They were the three most powerful fighters in the Great Qin Village, yet they seemed so weak in front of the mysterious Skeleton.Swish, swish, swish\u2026Ballista bolts containing massive force shot towards it, but the mysterious Skeleton coldly harrumphed and slashed with its sword. A crescent-shaped sword qi reduced the countless ballista bolts into dust, and the boundless sword qi did not stop, continuing on towards the ballistae.BOOM!!The sword qi landed on the 10 ballistae, and a massive explosion rang out as the ballistae exploded into fragments. A 20-meter wide crater appeared on the ground, and two of the Infantrymen who had not been able to escape in time were turned into a bloody mist.At that moment, a white light soundlessly arrived before the mysterious Skeleton again. Daisy had once again attacked, and the light split into 2, then 3, then 4, then 7 rings of different sizes.Just as the rings were about to fully take shape, the mysterious Skeleton stabbed them, destroying the 7 rings of light and causing them to dissipate as white motes of light.Powerful beyond belief. Terror, fear, despair, and helplessness assaulted everyone\u2019s hearts. The mysterious Skeleton was not something that they could stop.The mysterious Skeleton\u2019s cold gaze once again fell on Zhao Fu, who was behind the shield wall and many other soldiers. It slowly leaned forwards as its sword hummed and gave off a blinding, golden light.Bang!The mysterious Skeleton lightly pushed against the ground, causing the ground to crack. It flew towards Zhao Fu like a golden ray of light, and all of the soldiers blocked its path to Zhao Fu. However, they were all sent flying, and the mysterious Skeleton came before Zhao Fu. It raised its sword high into the air, preparing to slay Zhao Fu.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dMany of the soldiers coughed up blood and lay paralyzed on the ground. All they could do was watch in terror and cry out at the scene before them.BOOM!!!A shocking explosion sounded out as two bursts of absolute power collided together, resulting in a massive energy shockwave. The ground cracked and collapsed, resulting in a 10-meter wide crater.Zhao Fu\u2019s body gave off a dark, ink-like aura that looked like demonic flames. Zhao Fu\u2019s expression was one of dignity and might, and his eyes were completely cold as if he was a different person. The bronze sword in his stand stopped the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s attack, and his entire person radiated killing intent.Zhao Fu had used up a massive amount of Fate to activate the power of the Nation Armament, the Twelve Metal Colossi. He had even used the bronze sword of the Twelve Metal Colossi.The mysterious Skeleton seemed to be quite shocked because it hadn\u2019t expected Zhao Fu to be able to block its killing blow. Sensing dense killing intent from Zhao Fu, the mysterious Skeleton also became serious and retreated 10 meters away.\u201cHurry and go!\u201d Zhao Fu looked at his soldiers struggling to their feet, who were preparing to enter the fray. He immediately ordered them to retreat because this was no longer a battle that they could participate in.They understood how weak they were and that they were no help at all when they heard Zhao Fu\u2019s unquestionable tone. As such, they all obeyed and retreated out of the area.At this moment, the mysterious Skeleton once again attacked Zhao Fu. Its body disappeared and reappeared at Zhao Fu\u2019s side, and its sword seemed to contain enough force to shatter mountains as it sliced towards Zhao Fu\u2019s waist. In response, Zhao Fu spun and used his sword to block it.Clang!The two swords collided, resulting in a massive metallic collision. Just as Zhao Fu blocked the attack, the mysterious Skeleton suddenly raised its leg and kicked at Zhao Fu, and Zhao Fu used his free hand to punch at the mysterious Skeleton.Bang!!The leg and fist smashed together, resulting in another massive explosion. Both sides were knocked 10 or so meters away, but Zhao Fu\u2019s fist was bleeding, and his blood was dripping to the ground. On the other hand, the mysterious Skeleton seemed completely fine \u2013 that was the advantage of not having a fleshly body.Suddenly, the mysterious Skeleton once again rushed at him, and Zhao Fu no longer remained as passive. He raised his bronze sword and pointed it up as a black aura spiraled around it, and a blood-red spark appeared at the tip of the sword. It rapidly grew bigger and bigger until it formed a gigantic, 10-meter wide fireball, which looked like a blood-red sun, and its destructive aura covered the entire area.Even the mysterious Skeleton was shocked by this and quickly dodged. Zhao Fu slashed down with his sword, causing the massive fireball to shoot towards the mysterious Skeleton as a blur of red light.Bang!!The fireball exploded, and just as it was about to cover the mysterious Skeleton, it turned into 10 or so illusory blurs and avoided the massive fireball.Boom!!!However, Zhao Fu appeared right before the mysterious Skeleton in the next second, his sword unleashing large amounts of dark sword light. With a full-powered strike, the mysterious Skeleton was sent flying 100 meters away, and it smashed into a wall and caused that section to crack and collapse.Also immediately, a blur shot out from within the rubble, reaching Zhao Fu in an instant. Zhao Fu was caught off guard, and he quickly used his sword to defend himself.Bang!!!Zhao Fu felt as if he had been hit by a massive beast, and he was also sent flying 100 meters and hit a wall. Zhao Fu coughed up a mouthful of blood and wiped his mouth before standing up and looking at the mysterious Skeleton.At this moment, the mysterious Skeleton was giving off an aura that was 10 times as powerful as before, and it was to the point that its power was becoming corporeal. The air twisted and turned, and the ground slowly sank down. The mysterious Skeleton dragged its golden sword across the ground, which was now almost four meters long. The ground was like tofu, and it was easily split apart by the golden sword.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUnder the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s monstrous aura of despair, Zhao Fu\u2019s body instinctively started to tremble, but he resolutely bit his tongue. Immediately, pain traveled through his body, stopping his trembling. Zhao Fu then gripped the bronze sword and gathered all of his strength.By now, the mysterious Skeleton had reached Zhao Fu, and it slowly raised its near 4-meter long golden sword and slashed down at Zhao Fu.Boom!!!The air seemed to be cleaved in two, and the sword qi was like a river that slashed at Zhao Fu. Even though Zhao Fu used all of his strength to defend against the attack, he still seemed incredibly weak and small, and the sword qi slammed him against a wall. Even then, the sword qi continued to blast at him until a crater that was 30 meters deep, which was filled with cuts from the sword qi, was left within the wall.Within the depths of the crater, Zhao Fu\u2019s body was covered with both large and small cuts, and his blood covered his entire body. At this moment, he looked incredibly wretched.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then consumed the remaining Explosive Spirit Pills.The instant he swallowed all of these medicinal pills, Zhao Fu felt as if his heart had been gripped by a pair of large hands, causing it to thump with a low sound, and his entire body was wracked with pain by the powerful medicinal energy.\u201cArghhhhh!!!\u201d Zhao Fu tilted his head back and screamed in pain, and his body doubled in size as his veins bulged. His entire body became red, and his skin seemed to be on the verge of tearing \u2013 indeed, Zhao Fu\u2019s body was almost at the point of exploding.Zhao Fu stopped screaming as large amounts of blood-colored aura streamed out from his body. Over in the Great Qin Village\u2019s Village Hall, the Twelve Metal Colossi clanged noisily as a massive amount of killing energy flooded into Zhao Fu\u2019s body.BOOM!!!An explosion sounded out as an aura that was extremely powerful burst forth from Zhao Fu\u2019s body.At the mouth of the crater, the mysterious Skeleton coldly gazed at the black and blood-red aura streaming out.Bang!!Suddenly, a figure flashed out like a blur, and the mysterious Skeleton quickly used its sword to defend. However, it was still forced back by 10 or so meters.There was now a figure where the mysterious Skeleton had originally been standing. Zhao Fu\u2019s appearance had completely changed: is muscles bulged, his expression was savage, and his eyes started to leak blood. Massive amounts of black and blood-red aura streamed out of his body, making him seem like a demonic god.Zhao Fu gripped a bronze sword with each hand, and four bronze swords floated behind him. The six swords gave off a bronze light, making it seem as if Zhao Fu was dressed in bronze clothing.Right after forcing the mysterious Skeleton back, Zhao Fu rushed towards it and appeared above it in an instant. The two swords in his hand were filled with terrifying power as they hacked down at the mysterious Skeleton.The mysterious Skeleton coldly harrumphed, and its 4-meter long golden sword lightly hummed as it also released a powerful slash.BOOM!!!The three swords collided, resulting in a massive explosion. The air seemed to be blasted apart, and even the ground beneath them cracked and sank down to form what looked like the inverse of a tortoise\u2019s shell.In that instant, a 500-meter wide, 50-meter deep crater was formed.Under a pile of dirt, a golden sword light flashed, sending dirt and rocks flying, and the mysterious Skeleton crawled out, looking wretched.It looked at Zhao Fu, who was in front of it, and dragged its 4-meter long golden sword as it roared and charged at Zhao Fu.The 4-meter long golden sword gave off clear hums as traces of golden aura arose from it. The sword gave off a terrifying destructive aura, and even the ground was unable to withstand its power. As the mysterious Skeleton rushed up, the ground sank down wherever the sword passed over.Zhao Fu raised the swords in his hands, and adding on the four swords behind him, the six swords hummed as bronze sword light covered the surrounding 100-meter radius area. An extremely powerful sword aura was formed, and under this aura, the ground started to disappear.The mysterious Skeleton rushed up to Zhao Fu and brandished its massive, golden sword, sweeping it towards Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu raised the 2 bronze swords in his hand and slashed towards the mysterious Skeleton with an extremely powerful sword aura.BOOM!!!A shocking explosion sounded out as Zhao Fu\u2019s swords crossed with the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s golden sword, annihilating everything around them. It was as if time and space had both disappeared.Far away, Bai Qi and the others heard the continuous explosions and realized how terrifying the battle was. It was on a level that could destroy the heavens and the earth, and they were as powerless as a group of ants. All they could do was tremble when facing such power. Back on the battlefield, Zhao Fu and the mysterious Skeleton both flew backwards and crashed onto the ground. Zhao Fu cried out and coughed up a large mouthful of blood, but the mysterious Skeleton did not fare so well this time either \u2013 its golden bones had started to crack.Zhao Fu gritted his teeth and once again stood up before quickly going towards the mysterious Skeleton. The mysterious Skeleton also got to its feet and dragged its sword as it rushed towards Zhao Fu.Explosions rang out as the two sides faced off in this decisive battle, and everything around them was reduced to nothing.\u201cEight Direction Sword Cry!\u201d The mysterious Skeleton used the skill that the Skeleton General had used before \u2013 eight massive rays of golden sword qi suddenly shot towards Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu raised one of the bronze swords as countless black and blood-red auras spiraled around the sword, making this ordinary-looking sword look like a demonic blade. Above the tip, 30 gigantic fireballs instantly appeared, which looked like 30 small suns, and covered the entire area with a destructive aura.Zhao Fu pointed his sword at the mysterious Skeleton as the 30 massive fireballs flew towards it.BOOM!!The eight massive rays of golden sword qi and the 30 gigantic fireballs collided. Both contained incredible power, and after slamming into each other, an even more terrifying might was unleashed, resulting in an incredibly destructive shockwave.Everything around them either collapsed or was reduced to dust, and the shockwaves instantly covered the mysterious Skeleton and Zhao Fu as well.After the dust settled, a 1,000-meter wide, 100-meter deep hole had appeared. Because of their battle, the area had been expanded.Zhao Fu, covered in blood, climbed out of a heap of rock shards, while the mysterious Skeleton, covered with fractures, also climbed out of a pile of rubble.By now, both sides had more or less run out of strength, and even their life forces were flickering. However, this was the moment that would determine victory or defeat.\u201cHeaven! Exterminating! Sword!\u201d the mysterious Skeleton howled as it stood up and raised its 4-meter long golden sword upwards. A golden pillar of light shot up, forming a cloud layer of sword qi.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euClang! Clang! Clang!Sword qi collided in the air, releasing golden lightning. The golden cloud layer seemed to give off an aura that could exterminate the heavens, the earth, and all creatures.Zhao Fu also stood up and roared, releasing a black pillar of light that rushed upwards.Clang! Clang! Clang!Twelve ancient-looking bronze swords appeared above Zhao Fu\u2019s head, and they released black lightning. An aura that seemed as if it could slaughter the heavens and the earth and cause all creatures to tremble in fear slowly emanated outwards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Countless creatures reacted as if they had sensed a natural disaster, and the birds quickly flew away as the beasts started to run away.In the underground area, the two sides started to release their destructive might.The mysterious Skeleton tightly gripped its golden sword and roared as it sent all of its power into the golden sword, causing golden lightning to start encircling it.BOOM!!The mysterious Skeleton\u2019s strike towards Zhao Fu was simply indescribably powerful, and it seemed as if its sword could split the heavens and earth and destroy all life.\u201cArghhhh!!!\u201d Zhao Fu spread out his arms as he roared, and he was completely dyed in blood. The twelve bronze swords above his head released shocking black sword lights and let out a torrential amount of killing intent.Zhao Fu brought his hands together with great difficulty, and the twelve bronze swords fused into an incredibly terrifying black sword light that shot towards the mysterious Skeleton.This black sword light was also powerful beyond description, and it seemed as if it could destroy all natural laws and kill even gods.Very soon, the golden sword light and black sword light collided.BOOM!!An apocalyptic explosion sounded out as everything collapsed and turned into nothing. The golden pillar of light and black pillar of light rushed up through to the surface and into the clouds, causing the blue sky to suddenly darken.Everyone in the Forest of Horrors heard this sound, and it was extremely terrifying. The Flood dragon in the Forest of Horrors, the pure-looking young woman in Holy Light City, the man in armor in Soldier Forest, and the elder in green robes in Demon Tree City were all frightened by the sound, and they all looked in the direction of the Great Qin Village.The ordinary people quickly recovered after receiving a small fright. They were quite curious about the sound and started to discuss it among themselves.The Flood dragon quickly moved its nest as far away from the Great Qin Village as possible. It was deathly silent around where the pillars of light had come from \u2013 all of the birds and beasts had long since run away, and even the remnant power made it so that living creatures did not dare to go near. Soon, the two pillars disappeared by themselves.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Five days later, Zhao Fu weakly opened his eyes and looked at Asani, who was carefully feeding him medicine.Asani was carefully holding a bowl and using a spoon to feed Zhao Fu medicine. She was about to finish feeding him the medicine, and she was going to start healing him, as she was an Elven Priest. Even though her combat strength was not very strong, because she was still a young girl, her healing skills were abnormally powerful. As such, Li Si asked her to stay by Zhao Fu\u2019s side and take care of his injuries.When Asani saw that Zhao Fu had woken up, she excitedly ran out and yelled, \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s alive!\u201dFollowing this, everyone ran over to Zhao Fu\u2019s side. When they saw that he was awake, they all let out sighs of relief, and Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but smile and say, \u201cWhat are you all worried about? As a player, I won\u2019t really die. At most, I won\u2019t be able to enter the Heaven Awaken World for 10 days.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying, Your Majesty? Even though you won\u2019t really die, you\u2019re our esteemed Majesty, so how could we not feel worried about you?\u201d Li Si said as he cupped his fists together.Zhao Fu felt a warmth within his heart.At this moment, Bai Qi handed a sword-shaped shard that was glowing with a golden light to Zhao Fu and said, \u201cYour Majesty, this was the only thing that dropped after you killed the mysterious Skeleton.\u201dZhao Fu received the shard. It was the shard that had been embedded in the mysterious Skeleton\u2019s chest. Zhao Fu hadn\u2019t expected to survive the battle, nor did he expect that he would have been able to kill the mysterious Skeleton. All he wanted to do was use all of his strength to land a final blow on it.The shard was 10 centimeters long, and one side was a part of the edge of a sword, while the other side was fragmented. However, it still gave off a brilliant, golden light, and Zhao Fu looked at its description with a curious expression on his face.[King Armament Shard]: A shard of what used to be a King Armament. It contains Ancient King Power, and it is an extremely dangerous item.\u201c _So this is a fragment of a King Armament, which can only be obtained after possessing 24 General Armaments. And what\u2019s Ancient King Power?_ \u201d Zhao Fu suddenly thought of the golden light around the mysterious Skeleton \u2013 could that have been Ancient King Power? Could it be that the mysterious Skeleton had been so powerful because of this shard?It was probably possible to fuse this shard with other things. Right now, the highest grade item that Zhao Fu had was the Star Slashing Sword, but this shard was supposed to be fused with General Armaments. Right now, he had 89 Soldier Souls, so he might be able to use it quite soon. There were also two other pieces of Gold grade equipment. Since five days had passed, Gongsun Lin had most likely finished forging the Gold grade shield, and she should be working on the saber now.Those 2 pieces of Gold grade equipment were not for Zhao Fu to use, nor did he want to use them. An idea suddenly flashed in his mind as ordered for Rhode to be summoned.Bai Qi immediately used the teleportation channel to go to Rhode Village and brought Rhode to where Zhao Fu was. The big-bearded Grey Dwarf came to Zhao Fu\u2019s bed and asked respectfully, \u201cWhat have you summoned me for, Your Majesty?\u201dZhao Fu took out a rusty bronze command medallion \u2013 it was the Undead Command Seal that he had obtained from before. Zhao Fu then took off his Silver grade spatial ring and handed them to Rhode before asking, \u201cIs it possible to fuse these two items together?\u201dRhode looked at the command seal and the spatial ring closely before answering, \u201cI can indeed fuse them, but it will take a few days, Your Majesty.\u201dZhao Fu nodded and said, \u201cPlease fuse them then!\u201dFollowing this, Rhode took the two items and left.Zhao Fu turned his mind to more serious matters and asked, \u201cDid anything happen during the few days that I was asleep for?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLi Si thought for a moment before replying, \u201cThere are no big internal matters to speak of. General Bai Qi created four teams to continue exploring the Forest of Horrors, and he created a team for exploring the passages in the region of bones.\u201dHearing that last matter, Zhao Fu said with a serious expression, \u201cThe region of bones isn\u2019t simple at all, and we don\u2019t know how it was formed. Tell the exploration team to be extremely careful. If they encounter any danger, they must retreat at once.\u201dLi Si nodded.There was nothing much apart from that, and Zhao Fu focused on getting better. A few days passed in the blink of an eye, and because Asani stayed by his side to take care of him, they became much closer. Now, Asani was no longer as shy and scared around Zhao Fu.Rhode soon returned to the Great Qin Village and brought the new ring to Zhao Fu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Back then, Zhao Fu decided that it would be better to fuse the King Armament Shard with special equipment instead of normal equipment.Zhao Fu took out the sword-shaped shard, which glowed with golden light, and fused it with the grey-white ring. Zhao Fu watched as the sword-shaped sword slowly fused into the ring, and the appearance of the ring started to change \u2013 after the shard completely fused into it, the grey-white ring became a pure golden color.Following this, a system announcement sounded out in Zhao Fu\u2019s mind.\u201cSystem announcement! The 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen within your ring have completely fused with your ring and have become ring spirits. As long as the ring is not damaged, the 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen cannot be killed.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! Your 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen have received buffs from the ancient King\u2019s Power, and they have evolved into Chief grade Undead.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! Your 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen have received buffs from the ancient King\u2019s Power, and their professions have become King\u2019s Undead Cavalry.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! Your 10 King\u2019s Undead Cavalrymen\u2019s equipment has also been affected by the ancient King\u2019s Power and has evolved along with the King\u2019s Undead Cavalry.\u201dAfter hearing these system announcements, Zhao Fu quickly summoned the 10 Skeleton Cavalrymen \u2013 no, the 10 King\u2019s Undead Cavalrymen.As soon as they appeared, the 10 King\u2019s Undead Cavalrymen dismounted from their skeleton horses and knelt on one knee. They placed one fist over their hearts and lowered their heads as they said respectfully, \u201cKing!\u201dZhao Fu was quite surprised to hear the 10 King\u2019s Undead Cavalrymen speak. Moreover, they seemed to have some basic intelligence \u2013 after all, normal Skeletons had no intelligence and acted off of their instincts.Their appearance had also greatly changed. Their spirit flames had become a golden color, and their bronze concentrate armor had become a faint golden color. Their Skeleton horses were now also a faint golden color, and they did not give off the eeriness of a Skeleton anymore.Zhao Fu opened the King\u2019s Undead Cavalry\u2019s profession page and looked at it with great interest.[King\u2019s Undead Cavalry]: SS+ grade Military. Description: Skeleton Cavalry that has been transformed by the ancient King\u2019s Power. Effect: Receives [King\u2019s Power], [Death\u2019s Power].After looking at their new professions, Zhao Fu looked at the King\u2019s Undead Cavalry\u2019s stats, which were also abnormally powerful. Their stats were many times higher than before, and they now had 4 powerful skills.[Undead Cavalry\u2019s Body]: Grade: SS+ grade, Description: Reduces damage taken from skills by 50% and gives immunity to F grade skills.[Undead Cavalry\u2019s Charge]: Grade: SS+ grade, Description: Explosively releases a massive amount of power and rushes at all enemies.[Undead Cavalry\u2019s Slash]: Grade: SS+ grade, Description: Uses Death\u2019s Power to release an incredibly terrifying slash attack.[Undead Summon]: Grade: SS+ grade, Description: Can use corpses to summon large numbers of Undead who will listen to your commands.Out of these 4 powerful skills, Zhao Fu was most interested in the fourth one, Undead Summon, because normal corpses were useless to Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu had seen on the forum that other people had obtained similar skills, but those skills were quite limited. One had to grasp Death\u2019s Power, and the Undead they could summon were quite weak, only being 10% as powerful as they were at most.Moreover, one had to use one\u2019s mind to control them. If the Undead were not controlled, they would either disappear or go out of control. Ordinary people could only control a few Undead at most, and they were not very strong.Zhao Fu wondered how many Undead the King\u2019s Undead Cavalry could control. Luckily, they had basic intelligence, so he could conduct simple communications with them.After talking with the King\u2019s Undead Cavalry, Zhao Fu found that the Undead that they could summon retained 80% of their strength, but they had to be weaker than the King\u2019s Undead Cavalry. In other words, this skill could not be used on corpses that were more powerful than the King\u2019s Undead Cavalry.However, since the King\u2019s Undead Cavalry were already Chief grade Undead, they could control 300 Undead each, and with 10 of them, they could control a total of 3,000 Undead. As they became stronger, they would be able to control more Undead, and Zhao Fu would one day have an Undead army.This made Zhao Fu quite happy \u2013 Undead consumed essentially no resources, and they were already dead. If he used his own soldiers, they would die a true death if they were killed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter looking through all of the information about the King\u2019s Undead Cavalry, Zhao Fu did not put them back into the ring. Instead, he planned for them to join the teams exploring the Forest of Horrors. They would be able to become stronger by absorbing deathly auras, and they could start building up the Undead army, which could total 3,000 Undead.After that, Zhao Fu looked at the ring\u2019s stats.[King\u2019s Ring \u2013 Undead]: Grade: Legendary, Stats: All stats +5, Description: A ring that has fused with an ancient King Armament Shard and has been strengthened by it. Increases EXP gained by 400%, Achievement Points gained by 200%, chances of spawning S grade or above villagers by 200%, the maximum number of special professions by 200%, and stats of all villages by 10%.After looking at these stats, Zhao Fu was stunned, and he wondered if it was a mistake. Putting aside the stats that it gave him, the ring also increased the amount of experience the Great Qin Village received by four times, the amount of Achievement Points he received by two times, the chances of spawning S grade or above villagers by two times, the maximum number of people for special professions by two times, and all of his villages\u2019 stats by 10%.How could such powerful stats exist? Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but laugh loudly, and he slowly put the King\u2019s Ring on the index finger of his right hand. What Zhao Fu didn\u2019t expect was that another chain of system announcements would sound out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You have equipped the King\u2019s Ring, and the ancient King\u2019s Power has entered your body.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! Unknown changes are happening to your body.\u201dAfter Zhao Fu put on the ring, it gave off a golden light, and the light covered Zhao Fu\u2019s entire body. He felt a wave of energy entering his body, and he could feel that something was changing in his body.\u201cSystem announcement! The ancient King\u2019s Power has made unknown changes to your body.\u201d\u201cSystem announcement! Because the ancient King\u2019s Power has entered your body and you have the Legacy of an empire and the Nation Fate Legacy, you have unlocked the King profession before creating a country, and you have received your own King\u2019s Power.\u201dAfter hearing the final system announcement, Zhao Fu was quite confused, so he opened his stats page and had a look at the King profession.[King]: King grade. Description: A profession unlocked after creating a country, and it can be passed down to the next generation. It surpasses grades given to Military professions and represents the sovereignty of a King. Effect: Receives [King\u2019s Power].After reading this, Zhao Fu looked at his stats but saw that there were no changes. He opened his hand and an orb of weak golden light appeared in his hand \u2013 this was not the ancient King\u2019s Power from the ring, but the King\u2019s Power that belonged to himself.The King profession was quite different compared to normal soldier professions. The King profession did not have any skills or stat bonuses because one needed to develop one\u2019s own King profession. It was a profession that became stronger as one advanced. As such, it was not very strong in the beginning, but in later stages, it may not be weaker than even godly spirits.Zhao Fu had felt a lot of anguish after using up so much Fate, but it seemed that it was all worth it. The sword-shaped shard was worth much more than the Fate that he had used up. As long as he did not overuse his Fate, it would slowly recover.In the future, there would definitely be battles between Nation Armaments, and those battles would not be any smaller than battles between godly spirits. After all, those battles would be intense battles between entire nations.Of course, Nation Armaments were not things that ordinary nations would have. Only after establishing a dynasty would a Nation Armament be formed, so no country would have more Nation Armaments than China.China was at the center of the ancient world, and it could be said that China was where most of the Fate was gathered. That was why there were so many dynasties and Nation Armaments.Now that Zhao Fu had obtained the King\u2019s Ring and received many buffs, there were many things that he needed to take care of. For example, now that the limit of people who could have special professions had doubled, Zhao Fu could choose some more people to choose those professions. Moreover, now that the chance of summoning S grade or above villagers had doubled, the Great Qin Village would spawn around four S grade villagers every month.After taking care of these matters, a simple and straightforward-looking middle-aged man walked over to Zhao Fu with three wine bottles and said respectfully, \u201cYour Majesty, we\u2019ve finished brewing the Hundred Flower Wine.\u201dThis man was called Sun Yi, and he used to be a farmer who liked to brew wine in his free time. He had somehow raised his wine brewing skills to the Advanced level, and he was promoted to the manager of the winery. He was in charge of the wine brewing process, and the wine in his hand was the Hundred Flower Wine that he brewed from the recipe that Zhao Fu had given him.Zhao Fu looked at the three bottles of wine curiously and Sun Yi quickly explained, \u201cYour Majesty, these wines were made with different types of flowers. The first batch used 8 types of flowers; the second batch used 16 types of flowers; and the third batch used 32 types of flowers. All of them have different fragrances and tastes; please try them, Your Majesty.\u201dZhao Fu did not know much about wine. He opened the three bottles, causing the wine fragrances to come out. The fragrance of the third bottle was the strongest, and rather than wine, it seemed more like an expensive perfume.Zhao Fu took the cup that Sun Yi offered him and poured some out from the third bottle before tasting a little. The wine was very light and smooth, and he felt as if his entire body was giving off a faint fragrance.Following this, Zhao Fu tried the other two wines and found that the taste was not as good as the third type, but they were still high-class wines. Zhao Fu named the first batch Flower Fragrance Wine, the second one Moon Flower Wine, and the third one Drunken Flower Wine.These three types of wine would be the Westfall Restaurant\u2019s signature wines in the future. Many of the system\u2019s restaurants saw how successful the Westfall Restaurant was, and they also started to hire player chefs, which resulted in them taking some of Zhao Fu\u2019s business.Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t allow this to go on. After players were able to start buying land and start their own businesses, the competition would be even more intense. If he wanted to rise above them, he had to have something that others didn\u2019t. Zhao Fu asked Sun Yi how much of those wines had been brewed, and when he heard that quite a few bottles had already been made, Zhao Fu took them to the Westfall Restaurant. He would first ask others to taste them and give their opinions on them!Everyone ran over with curious looks on their faces. The fragrance that the wine gave off would definitely be liked by the women. When Zhao Fu saw the looks of pleasure and enjoyment on everyone\u2019s faces after tasting the wine, he understood the value of it.At this moment, He Xianru, who wore her veil and gave off the aura of a beauty, walked over. However, just as her eyes fell on Zhao Fu\u2019s body, two golden rays shot towards her and pierced into her eyes. The pain caused her to subconsciously retreat.Zhao Fu noticed this and curiously asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dHe Xianru lightly shook her head and gradually recovered. She looked at Zhao Fu with her bloodshot eyes and said, \u201cZhao! I need to talk to you.\u201dZhao Fu felt this was quite strange, but he still nodded and agreed.They went to a private room and He Xianru paid her respects to Zhao Fu before saying, \u201cCongratulations Your Majesty for receiving King\u2019s Power!\u201dZhao Fu was quite shocked, but when he remembered her reaction from when she first came over, he inwardly sighed, \u201c _People from the Hundred Schools of Thought are indeed quite extraordinary!_ \u201dZhao Fu nodded, acknowledging what He Xianru had just said.He Xianru once again spoke, saying, \u201cYour Majesty, would you like to hear some suggestions from this lowly one?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu thought about it before replying, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, your King\u2019s Power has not fused with your Fate. King\u2019s Power is incredibly powerful. It has the power to unite a nation and cause one to not even fear godly spirits, but one needs to fuse the King\u2019s Power with the Fates of all creatures on heaven and earth.\u201dZhao Fu was quite confused because he knew little to nothing about these matters. However, it seemed that she understood quite a bit of this power and knew how to use it.Following this, Zhao Fu and He Xianru started to discuss this matter in detail. Zhao Fu asked about everything he was not sure about, and He Xianru answered all of them in great depth.After a few hours, Zhao Fu felt that he had made great gains in his understanding, and his attitude towards He Xianru greatly changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He quickly ran over and said, \u201cBeautiful teacher, I\u2019ve been looking for you for a while. What were you doing with the boss in that room? Don\u2019t tell me that the boss did something to my teacher in that room?\u201dZhao Fu was speechless and stared at Huo Qing. After monitoring him for a while, Zhao Fu found out that Huo Qing might have some sort of special background, but he did not mention it. Zhao Fu did not know why He Xianru had accepted him as a student either.He Xianru glared at Huo Qing and said, \u201cYou impudent student, go cut a hundred radishes!\u201dA bitter expression appeared on Huo Qing\u2019s face as he replied, \u201cPlease, no! Beautiful teacher, I was wrong; I just want you to teach me how to cook.\u201dHe Xianru and Huo Qing returned to the kitchen, while Zhao Fu went to the entrance of the Westfall Restaurant. He poured out 3 bowls of flower wine and placed them on a table at the front of the Westfall Restaurant, causing the intoxicating fragrance to spread into the street.Countless people crowded around and asked, \u201cBoss Zhao, what sort of wine is this? It\u2019s so fragrant!\u201dZhao Fu smiled and replied, \u201cThese are three types of flower wine that Westfall Restaurant has developed. Right now, they\u2019re all 50% off, but this will only be for three days!\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, Boss Zhao, please sell me one pot!\u201d Countless people swarmed into the Westfall Restaurant to try the three types of flower wine.Zhao Fu set the price of the Flower Fragrance Wine at 8 silver coins, the Moon Flower Wine at 30 silver coins, and the Drunken Flower Wine at 500 silver coins.In actuality, brewing the Hundred Flower Wine only cost 20 copper coins per bottle, and the returns were incredibly high. This was especially so for the Drunken Flower Wine, which cost the equivalent of 50,000 copper coins. That was more than 2,000 times the original cost. One could even say that Zhao Fu was committing daylight robbery.However, it was not Zhao Fu\u2019s fault for setting prices so high. People oftentimes didn\u2019t eat food for its taste but as a show of their status and wealth. If the price was not high, the value of the wine couldn\u2019t be shown. The third type of wine, Drunken Flower Wine, was for upper-class society, and to them, 500 silver coins weren\u2019t much.News of the Westfall Restaurant\u2019s flower wine quickly spread, and many people came just to try the wine. Business became many times better, making many people feel both admiration and envy.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Following this, Zhao Fu went to a Smithy and knocked on the door before walking in. Gongsun Lin was preparing something, and when she saw Zhao Fu walk in, she smiled and said, \u201cZhao Xin! I\u2019ve finished forging both pieces of Gold grade equipment. Have a look!\u201dZhao Fu looked over and saw a large, golden shield. It was about half as tall as a person and was rhombus-shaped. There was also a saber that was long and thin, and it had a groove in the middle. The blade was also exceptionally sharp.Just as Zhao Fu was about to look at the stats, he curiously asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t they have names?\u201dGongsun Lin took out a small book and ran over while saying, \u201cI haven\u2019t thought of names for them yet; Zhao Xin, what do you think they should be called?\u201dZhao Fu thought about it before replying, \u201cHeroic Shield and Nine Mystic Sabre?\u201dGongsun Lin happily nodded as she smiled and replied, \u201cZhao Xin, your naming sense is much better than mine. I thought about it for a long time, but I still wasn\u2019t able to think of anything.\u201d After saying this, Gongsun Lin took out a pen and started to write in the book.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Zhao Fu asked with a curious expression on his face.Gongsun Lin replied while she wrote, \u201cThis is a tradition held by forging families. Every time we forge an item that we\u2019re satisfied with, we record it in detail. This is our \u2018Godly Armament List,\u2019 and everyone has his or her own. It records everything that we\u2019ve forged in our lifetimes.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Zhao Fu said as Gongsun Lin waved her hand, causing rays of light to shoot into the two pieces of equipment. Now, they both had names.[Heroic Shield]: Grade: Gold, Stats: Strength +10, Constitution +12, Description: A large shield forged from Hardearth Rock. It has an extremely strong defense.[Nine Mystic Sabre]: Grade: Gold, Stats: Strength +8, Constitution +8, Agility +6, Description: A saber forged from Black Iron Ore. It is incredibly sharp.\u201cI\u2019m going now, Zhao Xin. Let\u2019s meet again in the future if we have the opportunity!\u201dAs Zhao Fu was looking at the equipment, Gongsun Lin finished writing in her book. She put it away as she spoke to Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu felt a strange sense of disappointment in his heart when he heard that Gongsun Lin was going to go. However, he understood that she was only making equipment for him, and now that she had finished them, it was time for her to leave.Zhao Fu thought about it \u2013 since players couldn\u2019t leave the Forest of Horrors for now, with Gongsun Lin\u2019s ability to forge Gold grade equipment, Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but ask her to join him.However, Gongsun Lin lightly shook her head and refused, saying, \u201cThank you, Zhao Xin, but I\u2019m from a forging family. We wander here and there and spend our lives finding exquisite materials and forging godly armaments. As such, we won\u2019t stay at the same place for a long time. Plus, there are other places that I want to see.\u201dZhao Fu understood that she wanted to leave the main cities and the Forest of Horrors and journey to other places. However, considering her age, could she really survive in the wilderness? The Great Qin Village was in the wilderness, and Zhao Fu understood just how dangerous it was, so he couldn\u2019t help but remind her, \u201cIt\u2019ll be quite dangerous!\u201d\u201cMm, I know,\u201d Gongsun Lin replied as she lightly smiled.Seeing how fearless and resolute she was, Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t resist but ask, \u201cIs forging really that important to you?\u201d\u201cMhmm!\u201dGongsun Lin looked mature beyond her years as she said, \u201cWe live to forge and die for forging. Perhaps that\u2019s the fate of everyone from the forging families!\u201dZhao Fu fell silent, and Gongsun Lin did not say anything else. She packed her things and looked at Zhao Fu before squeezing out a smile and saying, \u201cLet\u2019s meet again, Zhao Xin!\u201dZhao Fu sighed and said, \u201cWait a moment!\u201dGongsun Lin nodded with a curious expression on his face.Zhao Fu left the Smithy and came back after a while, and he placed a ring in her hand.This ring could store living things, and it was worth 10 times more than a normal spatial ring. It was also smaller than a normal spatial ring because it only had around six square meters of space. Within it was a good quality Black Forest Horse.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe main cities still did not sell horses, and normal people used ordinary brown horses. Anyone who saw Zhao Fu\u2019s Black Forest Horses would be incredibly shocked. Zhao Fu gave this Black Forest Horse to Gongsun Lin in the hopes that she would be able to escape if she met any danger. Black Forest Horses were incredibly adept at going over obstacles, and it could outrun almost anything.\u201cThank you, Zhao Xin!\u201d Gongsun Lin said happily to Zhao Fu.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing; I wasn\u2019t even able to properly thank you for forging those two pieces of Gold grade equipment for me.\u201d\u201cNot at all, we were helping each other \u2013 I need high-quality materials to develop my abilities.\u201dAfterwards, the two of them said their goodbyes. Zhao Fu watched Gongsun Lin\u2019s figure slowly disappear into the distance and sighed before returning to the Great Qin Village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As for the Heroic Shield, Zhao Fu gave it to a Goblin Warrior with unrivaled strength. If he obtained an S grade Orb in the future, he would give it to him as well and greatly nurture him.After taking care of these matters, Zhao Fu went to the Heaven Prayer Platform. Right now, he needed to fuse his King\u2019s Power with his Fate. Zhao Fu sat cross-legged on the Heaven Prayer Platform and quietened his mind. He followed the method that He Xianru had taught him, and Fate from all over the Great Qin Village spiraled towards him.Within his body, a savage black dragon and a brilliant golden orb of light slowly fused together.Following this, Zhao Fu opened his eyes. He stretched out his hand, and a black orb of light appeared. This orb of light looked exactly like the golden orb of light except for the color, and there seemed to be some faint dragon-like inscriptions moving around in the black orb of light.Zhao Fu pressed the black orb of light down on the Heaven Prayer Platform, and a black semicircle expanded outwards. The black area also seemed to have dragon-like inscriptions moving around within it \u2013 this was Zhao Fu\u2019s King\u2019s Domain. It could be viewed as a barrier or a protective shield.This Domain could negate all damage and all skills. However, because Zhao Fu\u2019s current King\u2019s Power was still quite weak, it could not negate everything. In the later stages, it would become much more powerful, and battles between Kings relied on their Domains.Zhao Fu changed his thinking from before and decided to start participating in battles instead of hiding in the back. In the future, after obtaining some good materials, he would forge his own King\u2019s Sword.After fusing his King\u2019s Power with his Fate, Zhao Fu realized that he had not left the Heaven Awaken World in a long time. He returned to the real world and had some food before looking at the Heaven Awaken World forum as he normally did.Quite a few things had happened. Relations were tense between China and its neighbouring countries. Now that China was no longer dominated by Confucianism and did not value peace as much, China was instead filled with the clamoring of large families and the influence of the Hundred Schools of Thoughts, and it started to engage in conflicts with other countries. After all, in the end, this world was one where the powerful devoured the weak.Some of the weaker countries had immediately been scared, and some of their officials even made speeches in the real world about how hope and peace were extremely valuable and that it was better to live in peace than to fight.Right now, China was like a dormant dragon that was slowly awakening and revealing its terrifying might. It had already taken the number one spot in the world, and it also became the country with the most attention on it.Great Xia, Great Shang, Great Zhou, and Great Han\u2019s Legatees also made declarations that they wished to meet with Great Qin\u2019s Legatee.Countless factions were interested in this because Great Qin was not just some small nation but one of China\u2019s Five Great Empires. Putting aside how dangerous it was, Great Qin\u2019s mysterious Legatee had not appeared even once this entire time. Now that the other four Legatees had all said such things, just what was going on?Now that so many factions were paying such close attention to this matter, the Ying family started to go mad with desperation as well. They still had not found their Legatee despite looking for so long because the bloodlines were quite complicated. One person could have hundreds of descendants, resulting in tens of thousands of descendants over the ages. Now that thousands of years had passed, it was impossible for the Ying family to gather everyone who possessed their bloodline.Even though this matter was being watched by so many people, Great Qin\u2019s mysterious Legatee still had not appeared. This Legatee was like a thorn in many faction\u2019s hearts, making it so that they could not rest easy at night. As long as the Legatee appeared, no matter how powerful he was, they would at least know something about him. However, because they had no feel for his strength, they were absolutely terrified of him.Zhao Fu did not plan on revealing himself anytime soon. There wasn\u2019t a benefit to revealing himself, while there were many disadvantages. Zhao Fu wasn\u2019t an idiot.He ignored all of those discussions about himself and looked at other threads. Suddenly, he found a method to gain unlimited Achievement Points.\u201cUnlimited Achievement Points\u2026 is that possible?\u201dZhao Fu curiously looked at the thread, which said: _I\u2019m going to teach you all a great method on how to gain unlimited Achievement Points in the Heaven Awaken World. If you don\u2019t have many Achievement Points, have a look!__There are two main ways to get Achievement Points: attacking and conquering villages and killing powerful magic beasts.__What I\u2019m going to teach you all is how to use attacking and conquering villages to gain many Achievement Points. You\u2019ll need a City Creation Stone and a person to work with.__First, you use a City Creation Stone to build a village and then let the other person attack and conquer it. Afterwards, you attack the village that he conquered, and after repeating that a few times, your Achievement Points will shoot up.__However, that method can only be used a few times. What I\u2019m trying to teach everyone is how to obtain unlimited Achievement Points, so listen carefully to the next part. After farming Achievement Points a few times using that first method, choose to [Relocate] the village and continue doing the steps from before, then rinse and repeat. Trust me, it might not work if you only try it one or two times, but if you do it again and again, it\u2019ll definitely work! I promise I\u2019m not lying!_Zhao Fu thought that the thread made some sense, but he still felt that something was off. \u201c _If someone had really discovered such a massive secret, the benefits he would have received from selling that secret to a large family would have been infinitely great. Would he really give such a secret for free?_ \u201dZhao Fu looked through the replies, and the first reply was from a person called East Sun Wind, who said, \u201c _It\u2019s true! This boss is right; I got so many Achievement Points!\u201d_The second person to reply, a Lil Girly, said, \u201c _OP, I love you so much! Thanks for teaching us such a good method!\u201d_The third person to reply, Fifth Brother, posted, \u201c _Boss, you\u2019re such a good person! You\u2019re a living buddha!_ \u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026There were about 10 replies on the first page, all of which said that the method worked. However, the thread already had tens of thousands of replies, so Zhao Fu looked at a few at the end.Wolf Fang: \u201c _Goddamit, you stupid troll! Re-conquering the same village doesn\u2019t give any Achievement Points, and after continuously relocating the village, the City Creation Stone was damaged!!!\u201d_Loner: \u201c _OP, I\u2019m gonna screw your ass! I can\u2019t believe that I trusted you! Compensate me for my City Creation Stone!!\u201d_Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euProdigal Son: \u201c _You frickin troll!!! I\u2019ll screw your ancestors!!! Your elder was going to dominate this world, but now that\u2019s all been ruined!! Tell us your address if you dare, you goddamn asshole!!\u201d_\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Zhao Fu looked through 10 or so pages, and apart from the people on the first page, everyone was cursing at the poster of the thread. This thread wasn\u2019t one that taught how to gain unlimited Achievement Points but one that trolled and screwed people over.This \u2018do-gooder\u2019 had probably thought of this method to earn unlimited Achievement Points but had destroyed his City Heart trying to do so, so he decided to take some others down with him. The first few people were most likely accounts made by him to trick others.Anyone who understood the Heaven Awaken World and had a little bit of common sense would not believe such a thing. Some people who were curious might try once or twice, but after not receiving Achievement Points, they would stop. Of course, there were those who were silly enough to blindly trust that person, and they followed his instructions until they damaged their City Hearts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was no such thing as a free lunch, nor could someone rise to success in a single step. It was impossible to reap rewards without putting in effort, and those people had paid the price for thinking otherwise.Zhao Fu continued reading through the forum and looked at some other news.After this, Zhao Fu looked at the 10 Great Ancient Swords: the first was the Regulus Sword, the Sword of Holiness; the second was the Clear Sable Sword, the Sword of Mercy; the third was the Scarlet Firmament Sword, the Sword of Sovereignty; the fourth was the Taia Sword, the Sword of Might; the fifth was the Seven Star Dragon Abyss Sword, the Sword of Integrity; the sixth and seventh were a pair of swords, Ganjiang and Moxie, the Swords of True Love; the eighth was the Fish Intestine Sword, the Sword of Bravery; the ninth was the True Excellence Sword, the Sword of Matchless Honour; and the tenth was the Vague Shadow Sword, the Sword of Exquisite Elegance.[TLN: For those who are interested, these are all real swords in China\u2019s history]These were only the top 10 famed swords, and there were many other famed swords. For example, the founder of sword-forging, Ou Yezi, many of whose swords were in the top 10, forged many other swords as well: the Gongbu Sword, Evil-Suppressing Sword, Great Ravager Sword, Panying Sword, and Haocao Sword. There were also famed swords forged during the Spring and Autumn period: Sun-Shrouding Sword, Water-Ending Sword, Soul-Turning Sword, Leviathan Sword, Spirit-Destroying Sword, Evil-Repelling Sword, and Truesteel Sword. There were also other famed swords forged during the Tang Dynasty: Ninecrow Sword, Azure Frost Sword, Infirmity Sword, Azure Dragon Sword, etc\u2026There were also many other swords that had not been mentioned. Swords symbolized the Path of Kings, and blades were the symbol of the Path of Overlords. As such, most kings used swords. Who knew how many of the ancient swords still existed; all of them were incredibly powerful weapons.In terms of weapons, Zhao Fu quite liked swords. Perhaps in the future he would gather some rare materials and have people forge for him a few famed swords that would become legends as well.After looking through this information, just as Zhao Fu was about to turn off his computer and enter the Heaven Awaken World again, someone knocked on his door. Following this, a voice sounded out, \u201cMr. Zhao, Big Miss Xi would like to invite you over.\u201dIt was the bodyguard who was responsible for looking after him, so Zhao Fu decided it was best to go and meet Ying Xi.Zhao Fu followed the bodyguard to where Ying Xi was, and she was sitting elegantly beside a lake. There were a few attendants beside her, which indicated to Zhao Fu her status in the family. When he saw her, he asked, \u201cBig Miss Xi, what would you like to talk about?\u201dYing Xi replied somewhat unhappily, \u201cZhao Fu, I said that you don\u2019t need to be so courteous. You\u2019re part of the Ying family, so you can just call me by my name!\u201dSince she was the dominant party, what she said was law. Zhao Fu could only apologize and say, \u201cAlright, Ying Xi.\u201dYing Xi lightly smiled and said, \u201cThere\u2019ll be a gathering later, so prepare to come with me.\u201d\u201cGathering?\u201d Zhao Fu didn\u2019t want to go to the gathering. First, he didn\u2019t like lively and raucous atmospheres, and second, he was worried about his identity being exposed. He was especially worried about running into someone who was familiar with Fate, so he did not leave the house much. Now that Ying Xi wanted him to go to this gathering, he quickly refused, \u201cYing Xi! I don\u2019t really like those sorts of things, so I must apologi-\u201dBefore Zhao Fu could finish his sentence, Ying Xi cut him off, \u201cMm, that\u2019s fine! I just want to take you to meet someone; you can leave right after you\u2019ve met that person.\u201dSince there was no way for him to refuse, Zhao Fu could only agree. He followed a person who seemed to be a butler and was given a suit to put on.Following this, Zhao Fu waited in a room. When he saw Ying Xi again, she was wearing a beautiful white dress.She looked incredibly beautiful with her delicately-shaped face and tender skin. With the snow-white dress and the crystal necklace around her neck, she looked like a real princess. However, right now, Zhao Fu was not in a mood to appreciate her beauty, and he had countless thoughts running through his head.\u201cZhao Fu, let\u2019s go!\u201d Ying Xi said to Zhao Fu when she saw him with his head lowered.Zhao Fu came back to his senses and nodded before silently following behind her. They soon arrived in a large hall, where the banquet had already begun. There were many handsome men and beautiful women, and each of them possessed extraordinary bearings. They were all most likely a part of the Ying family\u2019s main family.Seeing Ying Xi, they all smiled and greeted her. Ying Xi smiled back and responded to their greetings, while Zhao Fu was completely ignored.\u201cZhao Fu, wait for me here. There are some matters I need to take care of,\u201d Ying Xi suddenly said.Zhao Fu nodded to show that he understood. Ying Xi walked to the front of the hall, where a few elders and a few young men and women were standing \u2013 they were most likely the other successors of the Ying family. Zhao Fu stood in the center of the hall, and no one paid any attention to him. In the end, Zhao Fu decided to stand in a reclusive corner to avoid drawing any attention to himself.\u201cAre you Zhao Fu?\u201d a voice suddenly said from behind him. Zhao Fu turned around and curiously looked over, and he saw a woman who was 1 or 2 years older than him. She was wearing a red dress and her hair was in a bob. She had a pretty-looking face and had red lipstick on, but she also gave off a sense of heroism and a slightly domineering air.Zhao Fu recognized this woman: she was the Student President of the university he studied at before, and she was called Wu Qingniang. They had met a few times in the past, and he had never expected to see her here.Zhao Fu nodded and replied, \u201cStudent President!\u201dWu Qingniang smiled, walked over, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t call me that here; just call me by my name. I was quite surprised when I heard that you dropped out, and I didn\u2019t think that I would meet you here!\u201dZhao Fu was also quite surprised. However, more so than meeting her here, he was surprised that she remembered him. After all, they had only met a few times in the past.\u201cDo you have the Ying family\u2019s bloodline?\u201d Wu Qingniang asked as she went to Zhao Fu\u2019s side and looked at him with a surprised expression and lightly smiled.It wasn\u2019t a secret, so Zhao Fu nodded and curiously asked, \u201cDo you also have the Ying family\u2019s bloodline?\u201dWu Qingniang lightly shook her head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have the Ying family\u2019s bloodline; I have the Wu family\u2019s bloodline!\u201d\u201cWu family?\u201dZhao Fu had no idea which historical family the Wu family was.\u201cQingniang!\u201d at this moment, Ying Xi finally finished her matters and called out to Wu Qingniang when she saw her by Zhao Fu\u2019s side.Wu Qingniang looked at Ying Xi, smiled, and said, \u201cLil Xi!\u201dZhao Fu saw that they seemed quite familiar with each other, so he stood there without saying anything.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYing Xi walked over and looked at Wu Qingniang and Zhao Fu, and Ying Xi smiled as she said, \u201cI wanted to introduce you two, but who would have thought that you already knew each other?\u201d\u201cLil Xi, the person you were talking about before was Zhao Fu?\u201d Wu Qingniang asked as she looked at Zhao Fu with a surprised expression.Ying Xi smiled and nodded.Wu Qingniang thought for a moment and seemed to realize something, causing her to smile.Zhao Fu had not spoken this entire time, and he watched them as they started chatting. Since it was getting late, he said his farewells and left first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was something small, but I was able to see his potential. He\u2019s too big for this small pond, and he has the potential to become a dragon. I have a feeling the whole world will know his name in the future,\u201d Wu Qingniang replied as she calmly smiled.\u201cReally? Why don\u2019t I feel that sort of feeling from him?\u201d Ying Xi asked with a curious expression on her face.Wu Qingniang replied, \u201cIt\u2019s because you haven\u2019t been able to completely see through him. My instincts have always been correct, so let\u2019s wait for that day!\u201dYing Xi lightly nodded.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Zhao Fu had no idea that those two women were still talking about him. Right now, he just wanted to be an unnoticed minor figure so that he could properly develop the Great Qin Village.After returning to his room, Zhao Fu took out the Heaven Awaken Stone and entered the Heaven Awaken World.By now, the four exploration teams had returned and brought with them large amounts of money and equipment, and they also brought two S grade corpses and 100 or so A grade corpses. There were also 900 or so villagers, two Normal grade City Creation Stones, and 1 Silver grade City Creation Stone. All of this caused Zhao Fu to feel incredibly happy.The 10 King\u2019s Undead Cavalry had gained 1,000 or so Skeleton soldiers. Of course, they were not as powerful as the Skeleton soldiers within the passage, but they were definitely stronger than normal Skeletons. The weapons they used were those that they wielded while they were still alive.Now, Zhao Fu controlled 30 villages, and the total population was more than 18,000 villagers. Despite having so many villagers, he did not have to worry about food because the crops only took around one month or so to grow with the Great Qin Village\u2019s bonus stats, and the output was much greater than normal.The Great Qin Village\u2019s territory was 300 square kilometers, and everything within that area benefited from the Great Qin Village\u2019s bonus stats. As such, to most major factions, food was the resource that they lacked the least.Zhao Fu did not continue to expand his army because 5,000 soldiers were already enough. Adding on the King\u2019s Undead Cavalry and the army of 3,000 Undead that they would have, his military would definitely be sufficient.Because Zhao Fu had only just obtained the King\u2019s Ring, the Great Qin Village only had a little more than 20,000 EXP and Zhao Fu only had 400 or so Achievement Points towards the next rank up, Second-Ranked Baron. However, leveling up would be much faster this time with 4x EXP and 2x Achievement Points.Finally, regarding the God-Refining Plan, because Zhao Fu was continuously using the energy from the energy stones to refine corpses and he needed to prepare some other things, it kept being pushed back.At this moment, Bai Shan came to report that they had successfully researched the language skill, and Zhao Fu went over to take a look with great interest.[Language Stone Stele]: Can learn: Chinese, Elvish, Orcish, Dwarvish, Kobold language, Goblin language, and Gnome language.Zhao Fu nodded with satisfaction when he saw the stone stele. Now that he had this stone stele, he could directly learn the languages recorded on there and wouldn\u2019t need interpreters anymore. Anyone who used this stone stele would be able to learn those languages.Zhao Fu learned all of the languages on there apart from Chinese and then ordered Bai Shan to start researching Intermediate teleportation channels because he wanted to leave the Forest of Horrors. One could only rely on one\u2019s own strength to break through from one region to another.Basic teleportation channels could only transport one to a main city, one\u2019s own teleportation channels, or a random place up to 500 kilometers away. Without Intermediate or Advanced teleportation channels, it would be impossible for one to leave the region one was spawned in.After taking care of matters in the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu went to Holy Light City and was surprised to see that all of Holy Light City seemed to be in a festive mood. There were many flowery banners in the streets, and all of the residents were in public places with big smiles on their faces.\u201c _What\u2019s going on? Is Holy Light City having some sort of festival?_ \u201d Zhao Fu went to the Westfall Restaurant and asked his employees what was going on.It turned out that today was a festival of the Heaven Awaken World called the Ten Thousand Flower Festival. The festival went on for 7 days, and during those 7 days, all of the flowers bloomed together in the Heaven Awaken World and released something called a Flower Tear. By collecting Flower Tears, one would be able to exchange them for countless things at the special stone steles in main cities.The residents said that this was a blessing from the heavens, but Zhao Fu felt like it was like an event in a game. He went to Holy Light City\u2019s Central Plaza and saw that there was indeed a new stone stele. It was completely crowded with people, and after taking a look, Zhao Fu was incredibly shocked.There was almost every type of reward possible: Legendary grade equipment, S grade skills, Gold grade City Creation Stones, extremely high-grade medicinal pills, special items\u2026Zhao Fu became incredibly excited when he saw those things. However, this event was one that the whole world would participate in, so indigenous residents of the Heaven Awaken World would also participate. The competition would be quite intense, and although the rewards were amazing, whether or not he could obtain them was another matter.The Ten Thousand Flower Festival would officially begin at 12 AM the next morning, so Zhao Fu returned to the Great Qin Village and started to make preparations. The other factions all did the same thing and started to wait for the festival to begin.12 AM the next morning, a large, round moon hung high in the sky. The pure moonlight made it so that it was not dark at all despite it being midnight. Under the beautiful moonlight, flowers started to slowly bloom \u2013 there were truly ten thousand flowers blooming together, giving off a dream-like feeling.Only a small percentage of flowers had a bean-sized, transparent orb at the center. Under the moonlight, they looked quite beautiful \u2013 these were most likely the Flower Tears.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Fu had already ordered all of his subordinates to collect these Flower Tears, including the four exploration teams.Because the Great Qin Village brewed Hundred Flower Wine, the villagers knew where the large patches of flowers were. Moreover, because the surrounding 200-kilometer radius area was under Zhao Fu\u2019s control, there was very little competition, and barely anyone dared to fight over the Flower Tears with Zhao Fu. This gave Zhao Fu an incredibly big advantage, and it also gave him the confidence that no one in the Forest of Horrors would be able to obtain more Flower Tears than him.However, this was not necessarily the case for the system\u2019s factions. There were roughly 300,000 residents and 100,000 soldiers in each of the main cities, adding up to 400,000 people per city. As for players, there were around 1 million per main city.The next day, when Zhao Fu went to Holy Light City, there were not only player factions buying Flower Tears for incredibly high prices, but the system\u2019s factions were also desperately buying Flower Tears. In fact, even the system\u2019s main cities started to send large numbers of soldiers and guards into the Forest of Horrors to collect Flower Tears.All of this made Zhao Fu\u2019s forces seem extremely weak. Zhao Fu knew that he would not be able to compete against the system\u2019s factions if he didn\u2019t think of anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hurry and contact me!\u201dThere were others yelling, \u201cSelling equipment for Flower Tears, super good deal! Don\u2019t miss this opportunity!\u201dThere was also a group shouting, \u201cAnyone who sells Flower Tears to White Tiger Gang will become one of our brothers. We\u2019ll protect him or her and make sure he or she eats and drinks well!\u201dThere were even pretty-looking women calling out, \u201cAnyone who gives me 100 Flower Tears can have me as his girlfriend for one day and can do anything he wants to me!\u201dThe outskirts of the main cities were filled with people, and the scene was in complete disorder. The outskirts of the main cities had been cleared of Flower Tears by players and residents in an instant, and there wasn\u2019t even a single drop remaining. With 1 million or so people scanning every inch of land, how could there be any left?As the areas near the main cities were cleared, people started to venture further and further away from the main cities. However, this also increased the danger for them.They not only had to be wary of Outlanders but also of other people who would steal their Flower Tears. One could not assume that the Flower Tears was one\u2019s after collecting them. In the face of such great profits, most people would not hold back. If anyone was robbed, no one would seek justice for him or her. Only by converting the Flower Tears into rewards would they truly belong to that person.Now, almost everyone knew the value of Flower Tears, and no one wanted to sell them. Occasionally, when someone announced that they were selling Flower Tears, they would instantly be surrounded by people and an auction would ensue. It would usually be the system\u2019s factions that obtained the Flower Tears \u2013 in terms of strength, the players simply could not compete.Zhao Fu also planned to use some money to buy Flower Tears. Even though the Great Qin Village was quite far away and was able to obtain Flower Tears without any competition, allowing him to collect more Flower Tears than normal system factions, he would not be able to beat the system\u2019s governmental factions.Normal people wanted to use Flower Tears to buy things that could not be bought with money, such as City Creation Stones. However, what the system\u2019s governmental factions were crazy about were the 37 pieces of Legendary grade equipment.Even the system\u2019s main cities\u2019 Legendary grade equipment could be counted on a single hand, and they were even more attractive to players who did not even have Gold grade equipment. This was even more so for the top three of the 37 pieces of Legendary grade equipment, which were Half-Epic grade. Some people had even created a Legendary Ranking based on their stats:Number 1, [Sky Demon]: Sword-type Weapon (Half-Epic), a weapon forged from a Sky Demon\u2019s corpse, and it contains [Sky Demon\u2019s Power].Number 2, [Dragon Soul]: Sabre-type Weapon (Half-Epic), a weapon forged from a divine dragon\u2019s dragon soul, and it contains [Divine Dragon\u2019s Power].Number 3, [Demigod]: Hammer-type Weapon (Half-Epic), an ordinary Legendary grade weapon that came into contact with great quantities of Demigod blood, and it contains [Demigod\u2019s Power].Number 4, [Vast Sun]: Bow-type Weapon (Legendary), a weapon forged from an Extreme Sun Stone and Extreme Sun Flames, and it contains [Sun\u2019s Power].Number 5, [Eighth Mountain]: Shield-type Defensive Item (Legendary), a defensive item forged from the Heart of the Eighth Mountain, and it contains [Eighth Mountain\u2019s Power].Number 6, [Djinn]: Stick-type Weapon (Legendary), a weapon that a Djinn was born with, and it contains [Djinn\u2019s Power].Number 7, [Sacred Heaven]: Armor-type Defensive Item (Legendary), an armor that can only be worn by high-tier Angels, and it contains [Holy Light\u2019s Power].Number 8, [Lightning Fang]: Hatchet-type Weapon (Legendary), a weapon forged from a massive Lightning Beast\u2019s fang, and it contains [Tribulation Lightning\u2019s Power].Number 9, [Frozen Soul]: Sword-type Weapon (Legendary), a weapon formed from the combination of thousands of chilling-ice souls, and it contains [Extreme Cold\u2019s Power].Number 10, [Spirit Tree]: Staff-type Weapon (Legendary), a weapon forged from a White Pagoda Spirit Tree that was over 1,000 years old, and it contains [Dryad\u2019s Power].Those were the top 10 pieces of equipment on the Legendary Rankings.They were enough to make everyone burn with desire and go crazy. Zhao Fu also desired them greatly, but people from all over the world were competing for them, so Zhao Fu felt quite a bit of pressure. As such, he started to plan what he would do next.Suddenly, Zhao Fu had an idea and he returned to the Great Qin Village. Right now, teleportation channels had three main functions. The first was to allow the user to travel between one teleportation channel and another. This sort of transportation was extremely accurate. The second was to send the user to a random place, which was quite risky.The third function was to send the user in a particular direction. If one chose to be sent east, one would appear somewhere to the east of where one had been before.Zhao Fu ordered all of his people to continue collecting Flower Tears. He took Bai Shan and another Scholar to the teleportation channel and used the third function, sending northward.Because Basic teleportation channels could only send the user a maximum of 500 kilometers when traveling without a set destination, Zhao Fu appeared at a mountainous region that seemed to be about 500 kilometers away from the Great Qin Village. He found a hidden place and asked Bai Shan and the other Scholar to quickly set up another teleportation channel here.About half an hour later, Bai Shan and the other Scholar quickly finished setting up the teleportation channel. Following this, Zhao Fu, Bai Shan, and the other Scholar used the third function northward again, sending them another 500 kilometers.This time, Zhao Fu appeared near a waterfall. He didn\u2019t waste any time and quickly found a cave. He then asked Bai Shan and the other Scholar to set up another teleportation channel here.After this teleportation channel was completed, the three of them once again traveled northward again.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter doing this 20 or so times, Zhao Fu and the two others arrived at a forest. Just as they were transported here, they heard a few wild beasts screaming pitifully. Following this, they saw 30 or so Orcs carrying a few wild boars walking towards them.When the Orcs saw them, they looked at each other before throwing down the wild boars, taking out their weapons, and rushing at Zhao Fu and his subordinates. This was the relationship between Humans and Outlanders: they were like water and fire.However, by the time the group of Orcs arrived at where Zhao Fu and his subordinates were, they saw that Zhao Fu showed no fear at all. Zhao Fu made a few strange sounds, causing the Orcs to immediately stop in their tracks. They looked at each other in shock \u2013 this human could speak Orcish.What Zhao Fu had just said was, \u201cWait, Orc warriors, I need to talk to you.\u201dEven though Zhao Fu had spoken to them in Orcish, the Orcs still surrounded him to stop him from escaping. At this moment, the leader of these Orcs said, \u201cHuman, hurry and spit out what you have to say.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This matter is extremely important, and I\u2019m sure that your great Lord Kaki will be very willing to meet with me!\u201dThe Orc leader asked with a shocked expression, \u201cHow did you know that we were great Lord Kaki\u2019s people?\u201dInwardly, Zhao Fu thought about the quest that required him to kill Kaki. It had given him the rough location, and after continuously teleporting northward, he had arrived in Kaki\u2019s territory. Now that he had met these Orcs, Zhao Fu had deduced that this was most likely Kaki\u2019s territory. Now that these Orcs had admitted it, Zhao Fu was even more certain.Of course, he couldn\u2019t say such a thing to these Orcs. Zhao Fu said, \u201cI\u2019ve long since heard of Lord Kaki\u2019s great name, and I\u2019ve brought some generous gifts to present to him. I hope you can take me to meet him or at least report this matter.\u201dAfter hearing that Zhao Fu had brought gifts, with the Orcs\u2019 personalities, how could they do as Zhao Fu asked? They savagely laughed and prepared to rush up and take the items by force.Zhao Fu\u2019s expression did not change in the slightest when he saw this because he was no longer the same person as before. Now, he had not only gained the King profession, but he had also gained King\u2019s Power. Zhao Fu slowly drew the Silver grade sword at his side when he saw the Orcs rush at him and casually slashed them with it.Bang!A massive wave of sword qi rushed out, knocking back the 10 or so Orcs at the front by 10 meters. The aura around Zhao Fu also became abnormally powerful, and the black cloak he wore gave off an incredibly deep and mysterious feeling, causing the other Orcs to retreat.\u201cWill you report this to your Lord now?\u201d Zhao Fu calmly asked.The Orcs did not have any principles, and they only understood that strength was supreme. The 10 or so Orcs on the ground quickly got to their feet \u2013 of course, Zhao Fu had restrained himself so as to not kill them. Following this, the Orcs\u2019 gazes towards them changed from viewing them as prey to viewing them as powerful enemies.Some of the Orcs departed to report this, while the rest continued to surround Zhao Fu and the two Scholars.Soon, a group of Orc Cavalry riding on Grey Wolves arrived. This was the first time Zhao Fu had seen Orc Cavalry, surprising him.\u201cHuman, come with us,\u201d the muscular Orc in the lead said as he looked at Zhao Fu.Hearing this, Zhao Fu nodded. He was glad that Kaki wasn\u2019t an idiot and hadn\u2019t sent an army to kill him. Anyone who was able to build a city of Orcs was definitely intelligent, and he probably had abilities that greatly surpassed those of ordinary Orcs.Afterwards, Zhao Fu and his two Scholars followed the Orc Cavalry to a city. The city looked quite crude, and its walls were built from large rocks. There were many Orc Archers stationed on the walls, and the city gave off a mighty feeling. This was truly an Orc City.After entering the city, the Orcs on the streets curiously looked at Zhao Fu and the two Scholars.Zhao Fu silently observed the Orc City\u2019s strength as he walked along. Apart from Orcs, he saw other races kept as slaves, such as Goblins and Gnomes. However, there were no Humans because Humans were usually immediately killed by Orcs.Furthermore, the Orc City had a great variety of military professions. Apart from Wolf Cavalry and Archers, they also had Heavy Shieldbearers. However, the Orcs did not have much armor because they could only forge simple equipment. At the same time, they were not a farming race and primarily obtained their food from hunting. As such, the food and equipment that Zhao Fu had offered were quite tempting to the Orcs.After continuing onwards, Zhao Fu saw a few Orc Shamans waving bone staffs on top of an altar, and a green light shot out. He had no idea what sort of ceremony they were performing.Finally, the Wolf Cavalry took the three of them to a large tent. The leader of the group spoke to the guards before bringing Zhao Fu and the two Scholars in.After entering, Zhao Fu saw an elderly Orc sitting within. Zhao Fu felt that he was not the Lord because he did not give off the unique aura of a Lord. However, he definitely had an important status.The elderly Orc\u2019s eyes were filled with intelligence, and he smiled as he stretched out his hand towards them and said, \u201cPlease sit, esteemed guests!\u201dZhao Fu nodded and sat on a chair covered with bear fur.\u201cMy name is Gunador, Kaki City\u2019s Vice-Lord! You can tell me what you have to say; I make decisions about things in Kaki City,\u201d Gunador, the elderly Orc, said.Zhao Fu did not beat around the bush because he could sense that Gunador was quite a wise Orc, so he got to the point and said, \u201cRespected Vice-Lord, I\u2019m sure you know about the Ten Thousand Flower Festival. Today, I have brought large amounts of food and equipment to exchange for Flower Tears, which are useless to you.\u201dOnly the system\u2019s main cities had stone steles that could be used to exchange Flower Tears for rewards, so Flower Tears were useless to Outlanders. Zhao Fu had realized this, and he had daringly come all this way to Kaki City.Gunador smiled and nodded. Orcs were not a farming race, and they relied on hunting. Because Orcs all had large appetites, they sometimes lacked food if hunting did not go well. Moreover, they were not skilled at forging, so they could only forge simple, crude equipment.Since Flower Tears were useless to Outlanders, it would be better to trade them for things that they actually needed \u2013 this was something that Gunador knew very well. He had long since guessed that this was the purpose for Zhao Fu\u2019s visit, so he had personally received him.After a lot of negotiating and bargaining, Zhao Fu and Gunador settled on a price for the food and equipment. Zhao Fu was incredibly happy \u2013 dealing with intelligent people was quite pleasant.Zhao Fu took out thousands of kilograms of food and hundreds of pieces of equipment from within the King\u2019s Ring. These pieces of equipment were ones that were no longer used by the Great Qin Village, and some of them were from the passage. Only a small portion of them was bronze concentrate equipment.After Zhao Fu fused the ring with the King Armament Shard, the storage increased from 300 square meters to 10,000 square meters, which was why he was able to bring so many things.After taking these things out, Zhao Fu smiled and cupped his hands as he said, \u201cThese are just a small gift to Vice-Lord; I hope that we\u2019ll be able to work together more in the future!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAh, yes, yes!\u201dGunador laughed and agreed. Indeed, there were many more opportunities for them to work together in the future. Gunador also gave Zhao Fu a command medallion \u2013 with this command medallion, Zhao Fu would be able to come and see Gunador anytime, so Zhao Fu accepted it.Afterwards, Zhao Fu ordered Bai Shan and the other Scholar to construct another teleportation channel that connected to the teleportation channel at the Great Qin Village. Zhao Fu set this teleportation channel to be only usable by the Great Qin Village\u2019s villagers and hid it in an extremely concealed place.Now that there were over 200,000 Orcs collecting Flower Tears for him, Zhao Fu was ecstatic. Moreover, Zhao Fu did not have to worry about the Orc City becoming more powerful \u2013 that was something for the system\u2019s three main cities to worry about. It would perhaps be difficult for a single main city to deal with the Orc City, but it would be no problem for the three main cities working together to defeat the Orc City.Right now, the Great Qin Village could not keep up with the Orc City\u2019s demand for food. Zhao Fu planned to go to the main cities to buy some food, and he did not have to worry about the price \u2013 after all, food was one of the cheapest resources right now!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123Of course, to avoid unnecessary trouble, Zhao Fu did not personally go to buy food. He arranged for some of his subordinates to do this. He also stationed 50 or so people in each of the three main cities to find out any secrets, to monitor the other factions, and to cover up some things that Zhao Fu could not do openly.The person in charge of this was called Guo Binglin. Last time, when Zhao Fu had obtained two S grade Orbs, he had given one to a Goblin Warrior and one to this man. Zhao Fu ordered him to never expose his identity \u2013 after all, this matter related to the Orc City, which the governmental factions were quite sensitive about.Guo Binglin acknowledged his instructions and left. Following this, news of a mysterious faction buying large amounts of food spread throughout the three main cities.All of the other factions were quite surprised about this, but because they all needed massive amounts of money to purchase Flower Tears and had too much food for their own forces anyway, they were quite delighted to hear that someone was buying so much food.As such, all of the factions brought large amounts of food to the main cities, and Zhao Fu bought all of it. Because food was quite cheap, he did not spend much money.Right now, all of the factions were quickly gathering Flower Tears, and Zhao Fu was no exception because he also wanted the Legendary grade equipment.Late at night, Zhao Fu asked Li Si to calculate their gains today.After going through the calculations, Li Si reported, \u201cYour Majesty, the Great Qin Village obtained 100,000 Flower Tears.\u201dHearing this, Zhao Fu sighed. If it was any other faction, it would have been delirious with joy, but Zhao Fu could only sigh. The Great Qin Village had obtained 100,000 Flower Tears through its massive advantages, but it was still far from enough.One Flower Tear could be exchanged for 10 Flower Tear Points, so 100,000 Flower Tears could be exchanged for 1 million Flower Tear Points. However, the equipment on the Legendary Rankings required at least 30 million Flower Tear Points. The Ten Thousand Flower Festival only lasted for 7 days, so if he only gained 100,000 Flower Tears every day, he would only have 7 million Flower Tear Points at the end of the festival. That was definitely not enough, which was why Zhao Fu had sighed.Right now, Zhao Fu could only place his hopes in the Orc City. During the day, the Great Qin Village had also collected five special Flower Tears. Instead of being transparent, they were pink-colored.The pink Flower Tears could be exchanged for 1,000 Flower Tear Points, so it was worth 100 Flower Tears. Moreover, he would be able to obtain a Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing if he collected 10 pink Flower Tears.[Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing: Effectiveness: Three years, Description: The Flower Fairy\u2019s wonderful blessing. It increases the speed at which flowers within your territory grow by 100% and the time it takes for flowers to wilt by 100%. Has a small chance to attract Flower Spirits.On the surface, this blessing did not seem to be very useful apart from beautifying the environment. However, it was quite useful to the Great Qin Village for brewing Hundred Flower Wine.Zhao Fu felt that the best part of the blessing was the final effect, \u2018Has a small chance of attracting Flower Spirits.\u2019\u201cWhat are Flower Spirits?\u201d Zhao Fu did not know much about them, but he could guess that they were useful creatures.At this moment, a soldier came to report that He Xianru wanted to see him. Zhao Fu was quite surprised, but he still went to Holy Light City.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zhao Fu said as he arrived at the third floor of the Westfall Restaurant and saw He Xianru sitting under the moonlight. There were some dishes on the table and a pot of wine.He Xianru slightly smiled and replied, \u201cPlease sit, Your Majesty. Let\u2019s talk as we eat.\u201dZhao Fu nodded and sat down.At this moment, He Xianru stood up and poured a cup of wine for Zhao Fu before saying, \u201cYour Majesty, are you feeling frustrated about the Flower Tears?\u201dZhao Fu smiled and said, \u201cLooks like there\u2019s nothing that I can keep from you. I was just feeling annoyed about them. At the rate that I\u2019m collecting them, it will be impossible for me to obtain a Legendary grade equipment.\u201d\u201cI have an idea, Your Majesty,\u201d He Xianru said softly.Zhao Fu asked, shocked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cHas Your Majesty read the description of the Heaven Prayer Platform?\u201d He Xianru asked.Zhao Fu nodded.He Xianru continued, \u201cThe Heaven Prayer Platform is not just for giving stat bonuses; its true use is to allow one to communicate with the Heavens and Earth.\u201dUpon hearing this, Zhao Fu suddenly realized something and asked, \u201cHow do we do this?\u201dFollowing this, He Xianru gave Zhao Fu a comprehensive explanation. After listening to her explanation, Zhao Fu immediately got up and ordered his people to make some preparations.\u201cYour Majesty, you\u2019ll only be able to carry this out after the sun rises tomorrow. There\u2019s no need to be so hurried; try some of my dishes first,\u201d He Xianru said as she lightly laughed.Zhao Fu understood that he was in too much of a hurry and smiled apologetically. He sat back down and drank all of the wine in his cup, and He Xianru helped him pour another cup.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Elsewhere, a handsome, pale-skinned young man with an extraordinary aura was standing on his Heaven Prayer Platform. He was Great Xia\u2019s Legatee, Si Ji.Beside Si Ji, there was a youth who gave off a mysterious aura and was fiddling around with an Eight Trigram Tablet. This youth\u2019s background was quite extraordinary as well \u2013 it was said that he was a descendant of Fuxi, and the youth was proficient at the Eight Trigrams Divination.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In another place, a well-built, muscular young man with a pointed face stood on the balcony of a building completely naked, and he gave off a cold and overbearing aura.At this moment, a few incredibly enchanting women who only wore light muslin and had incredibly seductive bodies came out and coyly laughed as they pulled Di Wutian into the room, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Majesty, just leave this to us sisters. Just enjoy yourself.\u201dThese women were also of incredible origins, and it was said that they were of the Nine-tailed Fox bloodline.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSomewhere else, a handsome young man smiled and chatted with a sagely and wise-looking elder.

In the blue sky, the moon had not fully disappeared yet.The Great Qin Village\u2019s residents all came to the Heaven Prayer Platform, which had a few flags inserted in it. A red carpet was rolled down the steps, and rows of valiant soldiers stood on both sides of it.\u201cHis Majesty has arrived!\u201dA loud and clear shout sounded out as the residents and soldiers all kneeled down. Zhao Fu was wearing his Dark Gold Dragon Crown and Dark Gold Dragon Robe, and he gave off the might of an Emperor as he walked out. Zhao Fu was followed by Li Si and his other main subordinates.Zhao Fu slowly started to walk up the steps, while Li Si and his other subordinates kneeled.Zhao Fu walked up one step at a time, his heart feeling incredibly clear. There was a table on the Heaven Prayer Platform, on which there were candles, an incense-burner, and offerings.Just as Zhao Fu reached the top of the Heaven Prayer Platform, the golden sun slowly rose from the east, piercing through all darkness. As golden sunlight fell on Zhao Fu\u2019s body, he seemed to glow with light, and he seemed to not only be majestic but also divine.Zhao Fu walked over to the table and lit three sticks of incense before bowing. He then held the three sticks of incense as he said, \u201cToday, this one comes as the Legatee of the Great Qin Empire to hold the first Heaven-Sacrifice Ceremony. I come with my subjects to offer our sacrifices to the heavens. We hope the heavens can see our sincerity.\u201dAfter saying this, Zhao Fu placed the three sticks of incense in the incense-burner, closed his eyes, slightly raised his face, and calmed down his heart, sensing the heavens and the earth.BOOM!!!A massive explosion seemed to ring out within Zhao Fu\u2019s mind. A boundless, ancient, mysterious aura descended, and Zhao Fu opened his eyes to see countless spots of light descending like snow. The scene was indescribably beautiful, and after these spots of light descended on flowers, they became translucent Flower Tears.Zhao Fu was overjoyed. The method He Xianru had told him about had indeed worked, and after concluding the Heaven-Sacrifice Ceremony, Zhao Fu sent orders for his people to collect these Flower Tears. Afterwards, they found that there were 1 million Flower Tears in total, which was worth 10 million Flower Tear Points. Naturally, Zhao Fu was incredibly happy.However, he could only carry out another Heaven-Sacrifice Ceremony after waiting for a long period of time, but he was already quite content. After all, 10 million Flower Tear Points was an astronomical amount of Flower Tear Points.Within the 1 million Flower Tears, Zhao Fu\u2019s people also found 10 pink Flower Tears and azure Flower Tears, which were even rarer. By combining 10 azure Flower Tears, he would be able to obtain a Level 2 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing.[Level 2 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing]: Effectiveness: Three years, Description: The Flower Fairy\u2019s wonderful blessing. It increases the speed at which flowers within your territory grow by 200% and the time it takes for flowers to wilt by 200%. Has a chance to attracting Flower Spirits.The Level 2 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing decreased the growing time by another 100% and increased the wilting time by another 100%. The small chance of attracting Flower Spirits also became \u2018a chance.\u2019Zhao Fu only had three azure Flower Tears, but he was not in a rush to collect all 10. He combined 10 of the pink Flower Tears, which turned into a pink orb the size of a pearl, and took it to the center of the Village before choosing to use it.The pink orb slowly rose from Zhao Fu\u2019s hand and flew into the sky, turning into the image of a beautiful young girl. The young girl looked to be only 15 or 16 years old, and she wore clothes that were made of flower petals. This was most likely the Flower Fairy!After the image of the Flower Fairy appeared, she lightly laughed before spreading out her hands, causing countless flower petals to descend. A pink wave of light spread out, and following this, the Flower Fairy\u2019s image slowly disappeared. At this moment, Zhao Fu received a system announcement that said that the Great Qin Village had received the Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing.After taking care of this matter, Zhao Fu took a large amount of food to the Orc City and took out Gunador\u2019s command medallion, gaining him access to Gunador\u2019s tent.\u201cRespected Vice-Lord, I\u2019ve brought a large amount of food. How many Flower Tears have your people collected?\u201d Zhao Fu said from under his black cloak.Gunador confidently smiled and took out 10 normal spatial rings. Zhao Fu took them and found that each of them contained 100,000 Flower Tears, meaning that the 10 rings contained 1 million Flower Tears in total. This was the result of 200,000 Orcs collecting Flower Tears.Zhao Fu was incredibly happy when he saw so many Flower Tears, and they exchanged the goods based on the rate that they had negotiated. Just like that, Zhao Fu had obtained another 1 million Flower Tears.\u201cLet us continue our partnership! I hope that respected Vice-Lord can continue gathering Flower Tears.\u201d Zhao Fu put the Flower Tears into his King\u2019s Ring as he cupped his hands and smiled.After obtaining so much food without losing a single soldier, Gunador was also ecstatic and quickly nodded as he smiled. Gunador was also happy because he was using something that was useless, Flower Tears, for something that he needed, food.After both sides obtained what they wanted, the transaction was perfectly concluded.Not long after Zhao Fu left, a well-built Orc, who gave off a sense of pressure, walked in and said unhappily, \u201cGunador, who do you trust this human and even trade with him?\u201dThe smile on Gunador\u2019s face did not fade at all as he replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t trust him; we\u2019re merely engaging in deals that benefit both of us!\u201d\u201cBut if he has so much food, why don\u2019t you just take it by force?\u201d the Orc retorted loudly.Gunador smiled as he shook his head and said, \u201cBodili, can you think before speaking? You should learn from humans in that regard. Violence isn\u2019t always the best solution. Do you want a bit of food or a lot of food?\u201dBodili, the well-built Orc, dumbly replied, \u201cOf course it\u2019s a lot of food!\u201d\u201cThen it should be clear to you!\u201d Gunador replied.However, after listening to Gunador, Bodili asked with a hazy look, \u201cGunador, what do you mean?\u201dHearing his words, Gunador, the most intelligent Orc in Kaki City, felt incredibly helpless.\u201cWhat is it? Explain!\u201d Bodili seemed to become interested and once again asked Gunador.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGunador shook his head with annoyance and felt that Bodili was quite an oddity. Even though Orcs sought strength, that did not mean they were stupid \u2013 Bodili was just exceptionally stupid. If Gunador answered his question, he would be swept into a whirlpool of questions and wouldn\u2019t be left alone for days.However, Bodili was a mighty fighter \u2013 apart from Lord Kaki, there was not a single Orc among the 200,000 or so Orcs who could defeat him.In order to make Bodili quickly leave so that he could make arrangements for the food that he had received, Gunador quickly said, \u201cLord Kaki seems to want to see you; go and pay him a visit!\u201dBodili nodded and believed that Kaki really wanted to see him, so he left. It was evident how easy it was to trick this fellow.Back at Holy Light City, Zhao Fu converted his 2 million Flower Tears into 20 million Flower Tear points. Following this, Zhao Fu looked at the top three pieces of equipment on the Legendary Rankings. However, a purple light suddenly flashed as one of the 37 pieces of Legendary grade equipment suddenly disappeared, shocking Zhao Fu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even though it was one of the lowest ranked ones, this was enough to shock countless factions, making them understand how intense the competition was. All of the factions started to madly buy Flower Tears, aiming to constantly buy them.The disappearance of one of the pieces of Legendary grade equipment somewhat shook Zhao Fu\u2019s heart, reducing his confidence in obtaining one of the top 10 pieces of Legendary grade equipment. As the saying went, there are mountains beyond mountains and heavens beyond heavens.Zhao Fu did not waste any time and returned to the Great Qin Village, and he instructed his people to quickly collect Flower Tears.Time always went by faster when one was busy. Soon, night fell, and Zhao Fu watched Li Si do his calculations before he reported, \u201cYour Majesty, we collected 150,000 Flower Tears this time!\u201dZhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but sigh again. Right now, they only had 2.27 million Flower Tears, which was still not enough. After returning to Holy Light City to convert the Flower Tears into Flower Tear Points, he saw that two more of the 37 pieces of Legendary grade equipment had disappeared. Now, three pieces of equipment had already been claimed.After looking at this, Zhao Fu was about to leave when he suddenly heard someone call out to him. He turned and saw that it was Jiang Rou.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zhao Fu softly asked Jiang Rou.Jiang Rou looked around before pulling Zhao Fu to an alley where no one was around, making Zhao Fu quite curious.\u201cThis is for you!\u201d At this moment, Jiang Rou handed him a normal spatial ring. Zhao Fu took it and looked inside, and he found about 6,000 Flower Tears within it. When Zhao Fu saw this, he immediately returned it to Jiang Rou.Jiang Rou asked curiously, \u201cZhao Xin, could it be that you don\u2019t need them? Don\u2019t worry, these Flower Tears belong to me, not the Jiang family.\u201dZhao Fu knew that he definitely couldn\u2019t accept them. Right now, all of the large families were desperately gathering Flower Tears. If her family found out that she had given him Flower Tears, she would be strictly reprimanded, and her life would become quite difficult.Zhao Fu was somewhat moved by her actions. Since Jiang Rou had treated him as a friend by taking such a risk to help him, how could he let her potentially suffer?Zhao Fu lightly laughed and shook his head, and he didn\u2019t give any reasons. Instead, he only said, \u201cThanks, but I can\u2019t accept it!\u201dJiang Rou took back the spatial ring. Each of them talked about his or her own situation, and they were able to gradually relax. Zhao Fu no longer felt as worried and anxious as before, and Jiang Rou did not feel as much pressure and nervousness.Afterwards, both of them smiled before leaving.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..The next day, Zhao Fu once again brought a large amount of food to Gunador\u2019s tent. He found that apart from Gunador, there was also an exceptionally strong Orc. He gave Zhao Fu a powerful sense of suppression, and he was more than 10 times stronger than the main cities\u2019 Stage 1 guards.This Orc caused Zhao Fu\u2019s pupils to contract because he could feel that this Orc had definitely reached at least Stage 3 in terms of cultivation.However, Zhao Fu\u2019s expression did not change because he had a powerful Nation Armament to rely on.\u201cRespected Vice-Lord, I\u2019ve once again brought a large amount of food. Have you prepared the Flower Tears?\u201d Zhao Fu cupped his hands as he smiled.Gunador also smiled as he replied, \u201cEsteemed guest, I\u2019ve already prepared them!\u201dAs he spoke, Gunador brought out 12 spatial rings. Zhao Fu was incredibly delighted, and after looking through them, he found that they collectively held 1.2 million Flower Tears. He then reciprocated by taking out the corresponding amount of food.After completing this transaction, Zhao Fu felt quite strange. From the beginning until now, the powerful Orc by Gunador\u2019s side had not said anything. He just sat there with his mouth closed and dumbly looked at him. Zhao Fu started to feel that this Orc had some sort of mental illness.Following this, Zhao Fu decided to quickly leave. He was not afraid of normal dogs, but he was afraid of the type that would suddenly start madly biting him.After Zhao Fu left, Bodili finally let out the breath he was holding and said, \u201cI feel that this human is not simple at all!\u201dUpon hearing this, Gunador was quite shocked and asked, \u201cHow did you know?\u201dBodili immediately replied, \u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t afraid of me glaring at him!\u201dGunador was speechless and ignored Bodili as he started to make arrangements for the food.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..After returning to the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu mounted Little Black and brought Little Grey along as he personally went out to search for Flower Tears.This time, he mainly relied on Little Grey\u2019s nose to find where large amounts of flowers were. However, there definitely weren\u2019t any nearby because this area had long since been searched by normal Grey Wolves, so Zhao Fu planned to go further.Zhao Fu rode on Little Black and followed behind Little Grey as it ran along. What surprised Zhao Fu was that he actually made a great discovery. They discovered a concealed valley, where there were all sorts of flowers growing. Zhao Fu was delighted to find a violet Flower Tear, which was even rarer than azure Flower Tears.The violet Flower Tear was as big as a marble, and it hovered above a red rose as it gave off a mysterious and majestic violet light.If one combined 10 violet Flower Tears, one would be able to receive a Level 3 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing.[Level 3 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing]: Effectiveness: 3 years, Description: The Flower Fairy\u2019s wonderful blessing. It increases the speed at which flowers within your territory grow by 400% and the time it takes for flowers to wilt by 400%. Has a high chance of attracting Flower Spirits.Surprisingly, the Level 3 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing did not increase the stat bonuses by another 100%. Instead, the stat bonuses were double that of the Level 2 Blessings, increasing the stat bonuses by 200%. There was also a high chance of attracting Flower Spirits. However, it was a pity that the violet Flower Tears were incredibly rare, as until now, he had only discovered a single one, while the Orc City had not found even one. At the same time, a single violet Flower Tear was worth 10,000 normal Flower Tears.By now, Zhao Fu had collected seven azure Flower Tears, and soon, he would be able to obtain a Level 2 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing.Afterwards, Zhao Fu returned to the Great Qin Village and took some people to the concealed valley to collect Flower Tears.At night, there was no moon in the sky. There were only a few dim stars in the sky, making the night seem quite dark.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis time, they had collected another 830,000 Flower Tears, and another eight pieces of Legendary grade equipment had disappeared. This time, one of them was the seventh-ranked equipment, [Sacred Heaven].This information made countless factions nervous and tense to the extreme, and Zhao Fu also started to feel worried. Early in the morning the next day, Zhao Fu headed to the Orc City to trade with Gunador again. This time, the Orcs had collected 1.3 million Flower Tears, allowing Zhao Fu to finally rest at ease.Now, Zhao Fu had a total of 5.6 million Flower Tears, which were worth 56 million Flower Tear Points. It was just enough to exchange for the first-ranked piece of legendary equipment, [Sky Demon].After traveling to Holy Light City, Zhao Fu felt somewhat nervous. After choosing the option to buy [Sky Demon] with his Flower Tear Points, it immediately entered his King\u2019s Ring.Suddenly, a half-orange and half-violet light shined from the stone stele as something that caused almost all of the factions to collapse with shock and terror happened: the top-ranked piece of legendary equipment, [Sky Demon], disappeared from the list.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now that even the top-ranked equipment had been claimed, what about the second and third? Would they still be able to obtain one of the top 10 pieces of Legendary grade equipment?\u201cHurry and get those Flower Tears as quickly as possible! Get them at any cost! I don\u2019t care if you have to buy them or take them by force; just get them!\u201d countless leaders yelled as their eyes became bloodshot.Now that the top-ranked piece of equipment, Sky Demon, had disappeared, they had all suffered a massive blow to their hearts. The shock was much greater than the seventh-ranked equipment, Sacred Heaven, being claimed.When Sacred Heaven had disappeared, all of the factions had felt incredibly tense. This told them that the top 10 pieces of equipment were no longer safe, and anyone could claim them at any moment.Now that the top-ranked piece of equipment, Sky Demon, had disappeared, what this meant was that all of the remaining pieces of Legendary grade equipment could be claimed at any second. This made all of the leaders feel as if their hearts were on fire.Most of the player factions guessed that a super-powerful system governmental faction had acted. However, all of the Lords of the main cities were incredibly shocked. They all wanted one of the three Half-Epic grade weapons, and none of them had thought that the top-ranked piece of equipment, Sky Demon, would suddenly disappear. As such, they all quickly acted.Si Ji, Di Wutian, Ji Shenming, and Liu Ye all wanted to possess Sky Demon because swords were the symbol of a king. China\u2019s 5,000-year-old history was filled with swords, and the top-ranked piece of equipment was not only a sword but also a Half-Epic grade piece of equipment.They had all envisioned themselves wielding this sword, and it would have opened the Path of Kings for them, helping them establish their empires.However, now, Sky Demon had been claimed by someone else, and they all been given a massive blow. Their confident expressions disappeared, and their faces became incredibly pale. However, they were soon dealt even bigger blows.Because of what Zhao Fu had done, the system governmental factions had all quickly acted. Dragon Soul, Demigod, Vast Sun, Eighth Mountain, and Djinn, which were all in the top 6, quickly disappeared.This not only made the 4 Legatees\u2019 faces become even paler, but all of the leaders of the player factions felt horrified as well.Right now, only the eighth-ranked piece of equipment, Lightning Fang; the ninth-ranked piece of equipment, Frozen Soul; and the tenth-ranked piece of equipment, Spirit Tree, remained out of the top 10 pieces of Legendary grade equipment.An even more intense competition erupted over the last three Legendary grade weapons.Of course, Zhao Fu did not know about any of this. After obtaining Sky Demon, he was incredibly excited and happy, and he immediately returned to the Great Qin Village.When Zhao Fu\u2019s subordinates heard that Zhao Fu had obtained Sky Demon, they all felt ecstatic.Zhao Fu took out Sky Demon. It was a pure-black sword, and it was about 1 meter in length. The edge of the blade seemed to give off a demonic light that wanted to devour people, and there was a picture of a savage demon on the sword hilt and blade. The hilt seemed to be covered with black scales, and it felt icy cold when held in one\u2019s hand. The entire sword had a demonic feeling, giving off an evil, cold, murderous aura.Suddenly, Sky Demon started to hum as it violently trembled. In the next moment, it broke free from Zhao Fu\u2019s hand and stabbed into the ground. Following this, large amounts of demonic qi streamed into the ground, and the ground started to turn black as if it was stained by ink. The darkness quickly spread until it covered the surrounding 10-meter radius area.A figure slowly appeared and stood on the hilt of the sword. She slowly opened her large, black wings, revealing her appearance.She was a female demon and was quite tall. Her jet-black hair fell to her waist, and she had the horns of a sheep on her head. Her face was quite beautiful, and it was to the point that it made one feel suffocated when looking at her. She had a pair of fangs, and her blood-red eyes gave off a cold air as she looked at Zhao Fu. Her voice contained a trace of arrogance as she said, \u201cHuman, you think you\u2019re good enough to wield me?\u201dWhen Zhao Fu saw this demon, he remembered Sky Demon\u2019s description. It had been forged from a Sky Demon\u2019s corpse, which was most likely the demon in front of him. More accurately speaking, the being in front of him was the sword spirit. She used to be a Sky Demon, but she was killed by some entity. Not only was her corpse forged into a weapon, but her soul was also sealed into the weapon, turning her into a sword spirit.Zhao Fu did not like her arrogant tone and the fact that she was standing so high up and was looking down at him while she spoke. Zhao Fu remained expressionless and coldly harrumphed as he stepped forwards, and a black domain filled with dragon inscriptions burst forth from his body.Zhao Fu released his King\u2019s Domain, which covered 30 meters, completely suppressing the Sky Demon Domain that the Sky Demon had released.This caused the Sky Demon to become quite shocked, and just as she wanted to retaliate, Zhao Fu once again coldly harrumphed. He released all of his might, and the domain expanded from 30 meters to 50 meters. The Sky Demon\u2019s domain completely collapsed, and it turned into wisps of demonic aura as it dissipated.The Sky Demon\u2019s face was quite pale, and her blood-red eyes stared at Zhao Fu as if she wanted to say something.Zhao Fu stretched out his hand towards the sword and closed it into a fist. The Sky Demon turned into a ray of black light and shot back into the sword, and a formless energy pulled the Sky Demon Sword into Zhao Fu\u2019s hand.Suddenly, a voice sounded in Zhao Fu\u2019s mind, \u201cHmph, human, I never thought you would have obtained King\u2019s Power. However, when I\u2019m at the peak of my strength, I won\u2019t fear you.\u201dZhao Fu sent his King\u2019s Power into the sword until the Sky Demon became subdued. Now, Zhao Fu finally had the chance to look at its stats.[Sky Demon \u2013 Sword]: Grade: Half-Epic, Stats: Strength +20, Intelligence +15, Constitution +10, Agility +10, Description: An extremely powerful demonic sword forged from a Sky Demon\u2019s corpse.The sword\u2019s stats were incredibly close to Epic grade, and it was only lacking an opportunity. Zhao Fu\u2019s heart leapt when he thought of the General Soul.The General Soul was equivalent to 10 Soldier Souls, and fusing 10 General Souls could create a General Armament. However, in terms of energy, a General Soul could not compare to 10 Soldier Souls.Zhao Fu decided that he would use his General Soul to raise the Sky Demon Sword to Epic grade. After making the decision, he took out the General Soul and chose to fuse it with the Sky Demon Sword.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs the General Soul slowly fused with the Sky Demon Sword, the Sky Demon Sword started to float in the air and flash with violet and orange light. As the light covered the sword, it seemed to go through some sort of change.Suddenly, wind and clouds swirled as golden clouds appeared in the sky. The violet light coming from the Sky Demon Sword dimmed before completely disappearing, and it was replaced by an ancient orange light. The golden clouds in the sky seemed to extend for hundreds of kilometers, and rainbow light streamed down from the heavens, which was accompanied by heavenly music. The scene was truly beautiful and awe-inspiring.The Sky Demon Sword in the air finished its evolution and slowly floated down. Creating Legendary grade equipment resulted in abnormal signs, and this abnormal sign was caused by the Sky Demon Sword rising to Epic grade.Zhao Fu caught the Sky Demon Sword as it floated down. Its aura seemed a bit more murderous, and it now felt better in Zhao Fu\u2019s grip.Suddenly, a voice sounded out in his mind, \u201cOwner! I still want more!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he still refused, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have any more!\u201d\u201cHmph! What a stingy human.\u201dThis Sky Demon\u2019s attitude changed incredibly quickly and Zhao Fu was left speechless. After saying this, the Sky Demon fell silent, and Zhao Fu looked at its stats again.[Sky Demon Sword]: Grade: Epic, Stats: Strength +30, Intelligence +25, Constitution +20, Agility +20, Description: An extremely powerful demonic sword forged from a Sky Demon\u2019s corpse.Each of the four stats had been increased by 10 points, and there seemed to be some special power within it that could not be displayed by the system\u2019s numbers. For equipment with equipment spirits, one had to rely on the equipment spirit to release the special power.Some equipment, such as the Sky Demon Sword, allowed the user to wield high-tier powers. Zhao Fu tightly gripped the Sky Demon Sword, and large amounts of demonic qi flowed out from it as he flicked his hand.Whoosh!A ray of black sword light flashed, and a 5-meter long gash appeared in the ground, with traces of demonic qi rising up from it. This was [Sky Demon\u2019s Power], which was many times more powerful than a normal demon\u2019s power.After looking at the Sky Demon Sword\u2019s stats, Zhao Fu put it away within his King\u2019s Ring. He felt quite content after obtaining the Sky Demon Sword, and it solved the problem of him lacking a suitable weapon.Moreover, after the latest transaction with the Orcs, Zhao Fu now had 10 azure Flower Tears. He combined them to form an azure orb, which he used to obtain the Level 2 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing.As for the violet Flower Tears, Zhao Fu now had three drops. Because of how rare they were, Zhao Fu was not sure if he would be able to collect 10 before the end of the Ten Thousand Flower Festival \u2013 once the Ten Thousand Flower Festival ended, all of the Flower Tears would disappear.Now that he had obtained the weapon that he wanted, Zhao Fu started looking at the other items. It was already the fourth day, and the Ten Thousand Flower Festival would end in another three days. As such, he could most likely obtain a few more items.Zhao Fu went to Holy Light City and looked at the Exchange Stone Stele. He was surprised to find that the top 10 pieces of Legendary ranked equipment had all suddenly disappeared \u2013 just what had happened? Of course, Zhao Fu did not know about the panic that he had caused after purchasing the Sky Demon Sword.Zhao Fu started looking at the other items. There were almost no City Creation Stones left because there were not many to begin with. As such, he started to look through the skills, medicinal pills, and special items.In the end, he found a few useful things. However, it was a pity that he had already used up all of the Flower Tears he had, and he could only look at the items for now.After going through the remaining items, Zhao Fu was about to leave when he saw a youth wearing a set of armor leading a large group of players to the Exchange Stone Stele. The players all made way for him and started to discuss in low voices, saying, \u201cI wonder how the Holy Light Group\u2019s harvest has been this time. I heard Liu Nanmi took them into the inner regions of the Forest of Horrors!\u201d\u201cHoly Light Group?\u201d It was the largest player faction in Holy Light City. Zhao Fu glanced over and felt that the youth in the lead was quite interesting. He was giving off faint ripples of Holy Light energy, but Zhao Fu understood that everyone had their own fortuitous encounters, so he did not take it to heart. In the end, Zhao Fu decided to remain in the crowd and spectate.When Zhao Fu was wearing his cloak, apart from those who knew him well, it was very difficult to recognize him. After all, Zhao Fu wasn\u2019t the only one wearing a cloak \u2013 in the Heaven Awaken World, one\u2019s appearance and voice did not change. If someone offended a person in the Heaven Awaken World, the offended party could easily find the offender in the real world from his or her appearance and voice. As such, many people wanted to avoid trouble by wearing cloaks.Liu Nanmi walked to the Exchange Stone Stele to exchange Flower Tears for Flower Tear Points, while the Holy Light Group stood behind him. At this moment, a spectating player curiously asked someone from the Holy Light Group, \u201cBro, I heard that the Holy Light Group went into the inner regions of the Forest of Horrors, and I respect you all a lot. Can I ask how many Flower Tears you guys collected?\u201dThe person who was asked had a pleased smile on his face and replied, \u201cBut of course \u2013 the Holy Light Group is the strongest faction in Holy Light City. This is how many Flower Tears we\u2019ve obtained.\u201dAfter saying this, the person smiled and raised one finger.Seeing this, the player who had asked was quite surprised and asked in shock, \u201c10,000 Flower Tears?!\u201dHearing this, the person from the Holy Light Group laughed and replied, \u201cNo, 100,000 Flower Tears!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe people around them were greatly dismayed and revealed expressions of shock as the person who had originally asked said, \u201cThe Holy Light Group obtained that many Flower Tears?! I\u2019d already be overjoyed if I had 100 Flower Tears.\u201dHearing the discussions around them, a look of pride appeared on the Holy Light Group\u2019s members\u2019 faces. Everyone else looked at them with admiration, and someone immediately asked, \u201cCaptain Liu, is the Holy Light Group still accepting people?\u201dBy now, Liu Nanmi had finished at the Exchange Stone Stele and smiled as he replied, \u201cThe Holy Light Group will always be accepting anyone who can pass our test.\u201d\u201cI want to join!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cPlease take me, Holy Light Group!\u201dCountless people shouted out, and the scene became quite lively and raucous. Zhao Fu smiled \u2013 to him, who had already spent more than 5 million Flower Tears, 100,000 Flower Tears was nothing. However, to normal people, it was already an astronomical figure.Those who heard that the Holy Light Group had obtained 100,000 Flower Tears were given a big fright, but if they heard that Zhao Fu had obtained more than 5 million Flower Tears, they would have been shocked to death.Currently, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t plan to establish a player faction because it was quite difficult to manage. No one wished to be bound by rigorous rules, and loyalty would be quite low. No one would be willing to be completely loyal and make great sacrifices for him, and when danger came, they would be the first to turn tail and run.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhat\u2019s more, if players died, they would respawn at another place. If Zhao Fu spent a lot of time and resources nurturing an elite and he or she died, all of that would have been a waste.As such, the large family\u2019s factions very rarely recruited players. Rather, they nurtured people who were completely loyal to them \u2013 it was much better to spend resources on those who they could count on rather than those who were there to leech resources.Even though the large families did not have many people, in terms of battle strength, player factions might not be able to win against the large family\u2019s factions. As such, the player factions with foresight would not accept just anyone. The resource consumption would be too great, and nurturing those without loyalty or ability would simply be a waste of their time.As such, only by developing a strict test, allowing only those with value to join, and then slowly developing their sense of belonging would they be truly loyal.Zhao Fu knew this very well, and because he had many things to take care of, he didn\u2019t plan, at least for now, to establish a player faction. Perhaps in the future would consider it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was the fifth day of the Ten Thousand Flower Festival, and he once again went to the Orc City to carry out a transaction. After obtaining 1.1 million Flower Tears from the Orc and combining them with the 100,000 or so Flower Tears that his own people had collected, Zhao Fu went to the Exchange Stone Stele and converted them all into Flower Tear Points before using them to purchase something Zhao Fu had previously had his eye on.[Hundred Origin Pill \u2013 Pill Recipe]: Grade: Blue grade (Stage 2), Required Ingredients: Hundred Origin Grass, Dried Five Root, and Bear Zoysia. Effects: Can increase cultivation speed by 400%.The Hundred Origin Pill Recipe cost 12 million Flower Tear Points, and Zhao Fu once again spent all of the Flower Tear Points he had. However, this was worth it because the Hundred Origin Pills were twice as effective as the Little Spirit Pills.At the same time, the Hundred Origin Pill\u2019s main ingredient was the Hundred Origin Grass, a Stage 2 medicinal grass. It would be more difficult to find than the Little Spirit Grass, so finding it would require some luck.Zhao Fu also obtained another two violet Flower Tears, increasing the total to five so far. There were only two days until the Ten Thousand Flower Festival ended, and Zhao Fu started to worry that he would not be able to collect enough violet Flower Tears in time.Time gradually passed, and soon, it was the sixth day of the Ten Thousand Flower Festival. Now, all of the weapons on the Legendary Rankings had been claimed. Countless factions had gone mad over the 37 pieces of Legendary grade equipment, and those who had obtained one were naturally quite happy, while those who had not felt incredibly depressed.Most of the Legendary grade equipment had most likely been obtained by the system\u2019s factions, and only a couple of them were purchased by player factions. To be able to obtain the top-ranked piece of equipment, Zhao Fu was definitely the biggest winner.On the sixth day, Zhao Fu obtained another 1.2 million Flower Tears from the Orcs, and he decided to use these Flower Tears to buy three items.Two of them were medicinal pills, while the other was a material.[Clearsky Gold]: Grade: Gold, Description: A type of ordinary Gold grade material that can be used to forge Gold grade equipment.Compared to directly exchanging for Gold grade equipment, exchanging Flower Tear Points for materials was far more cost-effective. Rhode was about to make a breakthrough and would be able to forge Gold grade equipment soon, so Zhao Fu was not worried.When Zhao Fu thought about Gold grade equipment, Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but think of Gongsun Lin and wonder how she was doing.The two medicinal pills were:[Bloodraising Pill]: Grade: Gold (Stage 4), Description: A medicinal pill that can upgrade a beast\u2019s bloodline [Note: Humans or Humanoid creatures cannot use this pill].Of course, these two medicinal pills were for the Grey Wolf King, Little Grey, and the Black Forest Horse King, Little Black. The Gold grade material cost 500,000 Flower Tear Points and the Bloodraising Pills cost 350,000 Flower Tear Points each, resulting in Zhao Fu once again spending all of the Flower Tear Points he had.As for the violet Flower Tears, Zhao Fu had only received one today, bringing him to a total of six. With only one day remaining, it seemed that he would need some extraordinary luck on the last day if he wanted to collect 10 of them.After returning to the Great Qin Village, Zhao Fu called Little Grey and Little Black over. Zhao Fu had promised them that he would help them become more powerful, and as a King, he couldn\u2019t break his word.After they came over, he gave them each a Bloodraising Pill. Little Grey and Little Black definitely had bloodlines because they were not just Chief class creatures. Just from the differences between them and ordinary Grey Wolves and Black Forest Horses, Zhao Fu could tell that there was something special about them.After Little Grey and Little Black devoured their Bloodraising Pills, changes started to happen within their bodies.\u201cNeigh!!!!\u201dLittle Black became quite frantic, and it began galloping about as green fire started to rise up from its body. The green fire continuously increased until it completely covered Little Black, and it continued to whinny in pain within the flames.\u201cAwoooooo!!!!!\u201dAfter Little Grey devoured the Bloodraising Pill, it terrifyingly howled as silver light started to stream out from its body. It raised its head and howled in pain as the grey on its body slowly receded.Their voices seemed as if they could cause rocks to shatter, and as they screamed in pain, all of the Grey Wolves and Black Forest Horses in the surrounding 10-kilometer radius area started to howl and scream along with their kings.The Great Qin Village suddenly became filled with howls and whinnies, giving Li Si a big fright. He quickly ran out to where Little Grey and Little Black were, and he saw the astonishing changes that they were going through. Li Si was just about to say something to Zhao Fu when Zhao Fu raised a hand. Li Si understood and respectfully retreated to one side.Zhao Fu stood with a calm expression as he watched the changes that Little Grey and Little Black were going through. Even though Zhao Fu knew that they were going through a lot of pain, this transformation was something that they had desired.Within the green flames, Little Black gave off a terrifying surge of power. Its body did not change much, but the short, black horn on its head rapidly grew until it was about 30 centimeters long, and it gave off a cold light.A while later, the green flames around Little Black\u2019s body slowly died down, and Little Black\u2019s transformation finished. Now, there were some more changes to its appearance.Apart from its black horn, its green eyes now looked like two balls of green flames, and they gave off an eerie feeling. Its body was even darker than before, and there were four small balls of flames around its four hooves. The aura around Little Black\u2019s body was also many times more powerful and dangerous.Following this, Little Grey\u2019s body gave off large amounts of silver light until it covered the 10-meter radius area around Little Grey. Silver motes of light filled the area, making the scene look quite beautiful. The tuft of silver fur on Little Grey\u2019s head suddenly shined like a flame, and the greyness in Little Grey\u2019s fur disappeared before being replaced by a white-silver color.Finally, Little Grey also finished its transformation.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIts body was now three times bigger than before, and it was now as big as a cart. All of its fur was now silver-colored and felt quite soft. Its eyes had also become silver, and its aura became more powerful and mysterious.After Little Grey and Little Black completed their transformations, the normal Grey Wolves and Black Forest Horses calmed down. Little Grey and Little Black rushed over to Zhao Fu and started to lick him to express how excited and happy they were.Zhao Fu laughed and stroked their heads as he looked at their stats. Apart from their stats greatly increasing, he found that Little Black had awakened a bloodline called [Underworld Nightmare] and had obtained [Underworld Nightmare\u2019s Power]. Little Grey had awakened a bloodline called [Star Moon] and had obtained [Star Moon\u2019s Power].\u201cCongratulations, Your Majesty!\u201d Seeing the shocking changes to Little Grey and Little Black, Li Si walked over and smiled as he congratulated Zhao Fu.Zhao Fu smiled and nodded. Little Grey and Little Black continued to affectionately rub their heads against Zhao Fu, and Zhao Fu patted them on the head before telling them to go and play. Zhao Fu went to take care of other matters, and soon, it reached the seventh day: the final day of the Ten Thousand Flower Festival.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His people had found two violet Flower Tears in the morning, bringing him to eight drops in total. Also, because the festival ended at 12 AM the next day, Zhao Fu did not go to the Orc City in the morning, and he instead decided to at 9 PM.Now that he had eight violet Flower Tears, just to be safe, Zhao Fu decided to see if anyone was selling violet Flower Tears to safeguard against not finding any more by the end of the day.He walked around Holy Light City but didn\u2019t find anything, so he went to Soldier Forest. After wandering around, he saw many people surrounding a street stall that had its goods laid out on the ground.The stall piqued Zhao Fu\u2019s curiosity, so he walked over. He was delighted to find that the owner of the stall was selling a violet Flower Tear. Of course, countless people wanted violet Flower Tears because a single one was worth 10,000 normal Flower Tears.The reason it hadn\u2019t been sold yet was because it cost too much. The owner wanted 3 million silver coins for it, which was 300 million copper coins or $3 billion in the real world.This was simply a ridiculous price \u2013 after all, normal Flower Tears were worth, at most, 20 silver coins, so a violet Flower Tear should only be worth 200,000 silver coins. However, even if the rarity of the violet Flower Tear made it worth much more than 200,000 silver coins, it should not be worth 3 million silver coins. Because this was the final day of the festival, if he could not collect 10 violet Flower Tears, he would only be able to use the violet Flower Tears as 10,000 normal Flower Tears.If this violet Flower Tear was sold on the first day, it might have been sold for 500,000 silver coins because it may have been possible to collect 10. However, now that the festival was drawing to a close and many people had given up, it was only worth around 300,000 silver coins.The owner of this stall had been extraordinarily lucky. He went with a large team to collect Flower Tears, but instead of finding any Flower Tears, he was chased by someone who tried to kill him. In the end, he fell down a mountain slope and found this violet Flower Tear.After making some inquiries, he heard that most large factions only had pink Flower Tears and hadn\u2019t even seen azure Flower Tears, much less violet Flower Tears, which were even rarer. He realized how rare violet Flower Tears were, which was why he dared to ask for such a high price.Zhao Fu went up and asked if the person was willing to sell it for 300,000 silver coins, but he was immediately rejected. He then offered 500,000 silver coins, but the owner of the stall adamantly refused to accept anything below 3 million silver coins.Zhao Fu continued to try to bargain with the owner of the stall, causing everyone around him to be shocked. Even a normal faction would not be able to spend so much money, and if it wasn\u2019t for his tone, they would have thought that he was from a powerful system faction.Since the owner of the stall was so stubborn, Zhao Fu didn\u2019t try to continue negotiating. Zhao Fu had already made great concessions, and he was not willing to spend 3 million silver coins. After all, even though he made a lot of money, he also had great expenditures. It would take him at least half a month to save up 3 million silver coins.Many of the people nearby excitedly went over to Zhao Fu and said that they were offering high rates for converting Heaven Awaken World currency to real-world currency. However, Zhao Fu had no interest in real-world currency because money in the real world would become completely worthless when the Heaven Awaken World devoured the real world.Now that Zhao Fu had eight violet Flower Tears and was only missing two more, he planned to go to the Orc City to see if they had collected any. If all else failed, he would have to accept being screwed over by the high price because it would be too much of a pity to give up after collecting so many.Following this, Zhao Fu went to the Orc City. Gunador was felt quite surprised when Zhao Fu had not come to trade in the morning, but when he remembered that the Ten Thousand Flower Festival ended at the end of the day, he realized that Zhao Fu would most likely come at night. Seeing Zhao Fu come now, he was quite surprised.\u201cEsteemed guest, have you come to trade?\u201d Gunador asked as he welcomed Zhao Fu into the tent.Zhao Fu lightly shook his head as he replied, \u201cRespected Vice-Lord, not right now. Because the Ten Thousand Flower Festival is ending at the end of the day, I will come at 9 PM. I\u2019m here now to ask if your people have collected any violet Flower Tears.\u201dGunador realized what this was about. The Orcs were not interested in the Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing because they did not like flowers, so they did not care about the differences between the Flower Tears.After listening to Zhao Fu, Gunador took out a spatial ring, retrieved a violet Flower Tear, and handed it to Zhao Fu as he said, \u201cEsteemed guest, these are very rare, so we\u2019ve only found one so far!\u201dZhao Fu was quite delighted and accepted the violet Flower Tear. Now, he had nine violet Flower Tears and only needed one more. Zhao Fu thought about it and thanked Gunador before arranging a time at night and going back to Soldier Forest.Now that he only required one more violet Flower Tear, he had to take the loss. Even though Zhao Fu really didn\u2019t want to go through with it, he had no other choice. It had been incredibly difficult to gather these nine violet Flower Tears, and without a tenth, he would not be able to obtain the Level 3 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing. This caused Zhao Fu\u2019s heart to feel quite uncomfortable.However, after returning to Soldier Forest, the only thing Zhao fu found was the stall owner\u2019s corpse. The stall owner had died quite pitifully: he had been hacked to death by many swords and sabres. Players\u2019 bodies would only disappear after one day in the Heaven Awaken World, so Zhao Fu was able to see the corpse when he returned.Only after asking around did Zhao Fu find out that not long after he had left, a group of people had come over right after the patrolling guards went by and risked their lives to kill the stall owner. In the Heaven Awaken World, anyone who killed someone else would obtain everything that the victim had on him.Following this, even though the group of people was chased down by the guards, a few of them were able to escape with the violet Flower Tear.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHearing this, Zhao Fu sighed. As long as the benefit was great enough, there were no such things as safety and security to those who possessed valuables. This sort of thing was not unexpected. After all, even if the violet Flower Tear was worth only 200,000 silver coins, that would be $200 million in the real world, which was why some people would risk everything to take it.Of course, normal shops had their own guards, who could massacre a group of players instantly. However, this sort of street stall was not as safe.Now that the only violet Flower Tear he had found for sale had been stolen, Zhao Fu started to worry about the final violet Flower Tear, and time continued to gradually pass.At 9 PM, Zhao Fu\u2019s own people had collected 160,000 Flower Tears, but there were no violet Flower Tears. Following this, Zhao Fu went to the Orc City, which was his last hope. This time, the Orc City had collected 1.7 million Flower Tears, but the Orcs had not collected any violet Flower Tears. This caused Zhao Fu\u2019s heart to plummeted \u2013 now, there were only three hours left until the end of the festival.Zhao Fu quickly went to Holy Light City and walked around. He was called over to the Westfall Restaurant by He Xianru, and upon seeing him, He Xianru smiled and stretched out her hand. Within it was a violet Flower Tear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He put the violet Flower Tear into his King\u2019s Ring and said sincerely, \u201cThank you!\u201dHe Xianru looked quite surprised as she replied, \u201cYour Majesty, there\u2019s no need to be so courteous. Everything I\u2019ve done is my duty as a subject.\u201dZhao Fu lightly shook his head as he replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not the Path of Emperors that I believe in. I understand that my own power is limited and that an empire cannot lack people like you.\u201dHearing Zhao Fu\u2019s words, He Xianru respectfully bowed and did not say anything. Zhao Fu quickly returned to the Great Qin Village, combined the 10 violet Flower Tears, and chose to combine them.Just like before, the violet orb slowly rose from Zhao Fu\u2019s hands and floated into the sky. It turned into the image of a beautiful girl, but the difference was that the girl no longer looked illusory. Instead, it looked quite real. What\u2019s more, there seemed to be intelligence in her eyes, and they did not look dead like before.Just like last time, the girl lightly laughed and spread out her hands, causing countless flower petals to descend from the sky, creating an incredibly beautiful scene. Following this, a violet light spread out.However, this time, the girl\u2019s body did not disappear. It instead slowly floated down from the air and came in front of Zhao Fu before softly hugging him.This caused Zhao Fu to feel quite stunned. However, he could feel that this girl seemed to be alive. He could feel her breath and smell a faint flowery fragrance from her.Zhao Fu did not do anything, and in the next second, the girl\u2019s body turned into motes of light before dispersing.System announcements sounded out within Zhao Fu\u2019s mind, telling him that he had obtained the Level 3 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing and a \u2018Flower\u2019s Embrace.\u2019[Flower\u2019s Embrace]: Effectiveness: Permanent, Description: The Flower Fairy\u2019s embrace is the most wonderful blessing. This blessing will increase your charm towards females, and it will make it easier for spirits to like you.Zhao Fu never expected to receive such a blessing after using the violet Flower Tears. However, it did not seem very useful to him \u2013 if a playboy had obtained it, it would have been like \u2018giving wings to a tiger,\u2019 but it seemed like a waste for Zhao Fu to have it.After obtaining the Level 3 Flower Fairy\u2019s Blessing, Zhao Fu traveled to Holy Light City, as he still had 1.8 million Flower Tears to spend.It was now 11 PM, and there was only one hour left until the Ten Thousand Flower Festival finished. However, the streets were still quite lively, and there were still lights everywhere.Zhao Fu went to the Exchange Stone Stele and looked at the remaining items. He first exchanged for three Gold grade materials, spending 1.5 million Flower Tears. He continued looking and found a detailed map of the Heaven Awaken World.The map was quite large, and it had roughly every region. It was definitely quite useful, but it was also expensive \u2013 it cost 2.5 million Flower Tear Points, which was 250,000 Flower Tears.\u201cAlright!\u201d Zhao Fu understood the value of the map, so he chose to buy it.His eyes continued to pass over item after item until they fell on a dress. The dress was violet-colored, simple, and unadorned, but it still looked quite beautiful and gave off a mysterious feeling.[Dreamwoven Palace Dress]: Grade: Silver, Stats: Intelligence +3, Agility +2, Constitution +1, Description: A dress woven from Fantasy Spider Silk. The dress also has some illusion and recovery properties.No wonder this dress seemed so beautiful \u2013 it was made from Fantasy Spider Silk. Fantasy-type materials were quite rare, and after he looked at his remaining 50,000 Flower Tears, Zhao Fu decided to buy it since there was not much else that he could spend those Flower Tears on.Zhao Fu bought it with his remaining points, and he decided to give it to He Xianru. After all, she had helped him quite a lot this time.He headed to the Westfall Restaurant and presented the Dreamwoven Palace Dress to her, making her surprised. Because of Zhao Fu\u2019s personality, she had never thought that he would buy her a dress. However, she quickly accepted it and thanked him for it.Following this, Zhao Fu went out of the Heaven Awaken World. Because he did not have his own intelligence network, he could only collect information about the various factions through the Heaven Awaken World forum. Only then would he be able to gauge their strength and not be a frog at the bottom of the well.Zhao Fu opened up the Heaven Awaken World forum and started to look through it. The top thread right now was about the owners of the 37 pieces of Legendary grade equipment. This greatly piqued Zhao Fu\u2019s interest, so he clicked on it and started reading.Number 1, [Sky Demon]: Obtained by an unknown faction (My guess: It was probably one of the most powerful system factions. Even though we don\u2019t know who it belongs to, it will definitely become a great obstacle for players, so please be careful!)Number 2, [Dragon Soul]: Obtained by an unknown faction (My guess: It definitely belongs to one of the most powerful system factions because it disappeared only a few minutes after Sky Demon disappeared.)Number 3, [Demigod]: Obtained by an unknown faction (My guess: It definitely belongs to one of the most powerful system factions, but the faction should be weaker than the above two factions. It\u2019s still an existence that player factions can only look up at.)The top five pieces of equipment were all obtained by unknown factions, but the sixth-ranked piece of equipment, Djinn, was confirmed to have been obtained by one of the system\u2019s factions, Moongazing City.After reading the guess on Sky Demon, Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but laugh at \u2018it will become a great obstacle for players, so please be careful!\u2019Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe knew his own strength very well, and he had only obtained Sky Demon through much luck and fortune. If he had been a few minutes late, the Sky Demon Sword definitely would have been taken by the second-ranked faction.It seemed that apart from Zhao Fu, none of the factions that had obtained one of the top six pieces equipment were player factions. However, the seventh-ranked piece of equipment, Sacred Heaven, which was the first equipment to be claimed, was actually taken by a player.The player was the descendant of the famous King Arthur of the western world\u2026 Tina Pendragon.This sent alarm bells to countless factions, especially to China, which was supposedly the most powerful country so far. A powerful force apart from China had already appeared.The following three pieces of equipment, [Lightning Fang], [Frozen Soul], and [Spirit Tree], were respectively claimed by Great Xia, Great Zhou, and Great Shang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123The eleventh-ranked piece of equipment was obtained by the Roman Empire\u2019s Legatee, the descendant of Augustus Caesar; the twelfth-ranked piece of equipment was obtained by Great Han; and the thirteenth-ranked piece of equipment was obtained by Pharaoh Akhenaten\u2019s descendant.The next seven pieces of equipment on the rankings were all obtained by system factions, while the twenty first-ranked piece of equipment was obtained by Great Tang.All of this information caused Zhao Fu to be quite surprised and intrigued. The twenty second-ranked piece of equipment was obtained by Oda Nobunaga\u2019s descendant; the twenty third-ranked piece of equipment was obtained by the Tsarist Empire; and the twenty fourth-ranked piece of equipment was obtained by ancient India.The remaining pieces of equipment were all obtained by the system\u2019s factions. It was clear how lucky Zhao Fu had been to obtain the top-ranked piece of equipment, Sky Demon, and it was also clear how intense the competition was.Moreover, Legendary grade equipment contained massive amounts of power, and they were the symbols of the powerful. Even if one had 100,000 pieces of Gold grade equipment, one might not have a single piece of Legendary grade equipment. It was evident just how rare Legendary grade equipment was, and it could not be viewed as merely a step up from Gold grade equipment.After looking through this information, apart from the Chinese factions, the one that Zhao Fu paid the most attention to was King Arthur\u2019s descendant. It was completely unexpected that she would obtain Sacred Heaven so quickly, and Zhao Fu had a premonition that she would become one of his greatest enemies.Sitting on his chair, Zhao Fu sank into deep thought before slowly breathing out looking at the Heaven Awaken World forum again to see if there was anything else. Soon, Zhao Fu found a grave matter, which was that some of the Ancient Fallen Clans had been revived.Ancient Fallen Clans referred to clans that had died out. Even though they still had some descendants here and there, the clan or family itself had perished and no longer existed in the real world.For example, in China, there were the Nine Li Clan led by Chiyou, who fought against the Yellow Emperor; the Spring and Autumn Period\u2019s Yi Clan in the east, Man Clan in the south, Rong Clan in the west, and Di Clan in the north; the Han Dynasty\u2019s Xiongnu Clan, Tokhara Clan, Xianbei Clan, etc\u2026These clans did not have players entering the Heaven Awaken World, but they were instead revived within the Heaven Awaken World as indigenous resident villages of the Heaven Awaken World. They were also different compared to normal indigenous resident villages. Not only did they have a bloodline, but they also had their own history, culture, and traditions.Their appearance was not very favorable to the Chinese players, and there were often reports of places being attacked by the Xiongnu Clan, Liao People, or Jin People.After looking at that forum thread, Zhao Fu felt a headache coming on. This world was simply too chaotic, and based on the current situation, the future would be filled with rivers of blood, mountains of corpses, and the death of countless heroes.The Ancient Fallen Clans had the same starting points as players, so they did not have anything above Towns, though this might change in the future. However, while players could come back to life after they died, the Ancient Fallen Clans\u2019 people would die a true death. In other words, once the entire clan fell, it would be exterminated forever.The Heaven Awaken World was most likely giving these clans a final chance \u2013 if they grasped this chance, they would be able to continue existing, and if they couldn\u2019t, then they would be completely exterminated.After looking through these things, Zhao Fu headed back into the Heaven Awaken World with some worries on his mind. Now that the Ten Thousand Flower Festival had ended, everything returned to normal.Zhao Fu reorganized the four exploration teams and sent them off in different directions to explore. At the same time, he ordered them to keep an eye out for any Ancient Fallen Clans around the Great Qin Village. Even though the Heaven Awaken World was quite chaotic, there were many opportunities within it. Now, the Great Qin Village could attack Human indigenous resident villages, Outlander Villages, and the Ancient Fallen Clan Villages.Holy Light City\u2019s business had returned to normal. Before, because of the Ten Thousand Flower Festival, there were a countless number of people heading outside of the city to look for Flower Tears, so all businesses had taken a big hit. After the festival had concluded, business started to return to normal.Zhao Fu felt that there was not much else for him to do because there was nothing else that required his personal attention. Everyone had their own things to do, so Zhao Fu was quite bored. Thus, he decided to do some town planning for the Great Qin Village.In actuality, Zhao Fu had left this to Li Si, and he had done quite well: the Great Qin Village was split into four regions: North, South, East, and West, just like the system main cities, and they were further divided into the Residential District, Business District, etc. Everything was orderly and well-planned.The planning and building of the Great Qin Village did not require Zhao Fu to personally act, as his people had already done a good job. They might be able to sell some special products after Intermediate teleportation channels have been researched and the road to the outside world was opened up.Zhao Fu thought of a unique fruit in the Forest of Horrors, which was the Black Forest Fruit. They were about as big as plums, and they had black skin and red flesh. The taste was quite good, and since his territory was so large, it would be a waste not to grow any.Black Forest Fruits could be sold to the outside world as special products and would earn them a decent amount of money, so Zhao Fu started to order some people to plant many Black Forest Trees.Time continued to pass, and soon, a few days had passed. On this day, Bai Qi came to report that his cultivation had formally broken through to Stage 1.This delighted Zhao Fu, as the Great Qin Village finally had someone who was at Stage 1. At the same time, Zhao Fu opened up Bai Qi\u2019s stats page with a curious expression on his face and had a look.Name: Bai QiGrade: SSSTitle: [God of Killing]Profession: [Stage 1 General]Achievement Points: Commoner (68/200)Race: HumanAge: 24 (110)Loyalty: 100Stats: Strength: 38, Intelligence: 22, Constitution:29, Agility: 25Cultivation: Stage 1-0Cultivation Technique: Great Qin MantraSkills: Qi Slash, Basic Sword Technique\u2026Equipment: Ice \u2013 Star Slashing Sword\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter looking through Bai Qi\u2019s stats, Zhao Fu found that apart from the changes in his stats, his profession had become \u2018Stage 1 General\u2019 and his lifespan had increased by 10 years from 100 years to 110 years.Zhao Fu did not pay attention to all of this \u2013 he first looked at the difference between the Stage 1 General profession and the original General profession.[Stage 1 General]: C+ grade Military, Description: A profession obtained through a General leveling up, Effect: Can train the General\u2019s [Unique Military Profession].[Unique Military Profession \u2013 Unnamed]: D- grade Military, Description: Soldiers personally trained by a Stage 1 General. They can be a historical military profession or a new military profession. Current limit: 100 people. Effect: Receives a skill based on the profession.Zhao Fu was quite delighted, as any of his Generals who reached Stage 1 would be able to train their own military profession. What\u2019s more, the Unique Military Profession was D-grade, which meant that it was not weaker than the Outlanders\u2019 Special Professions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0MrVoltaire\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Modlawls123Even though Stage 1 Generals could only have 100 people with their Unique Military Profession, as they became stronger, they would be able to train more people with that profession.There were two types of Unique Military Professions: one was creating a new profession, while the other was choosing a historical profession, such as Great Qin\u2019s famed Iron Eagle Elite Soldiers.Developing a new profession or choosing a historical profession had their own advantages. Developing a new profession meant that one could adapt to one\u2019s circumstances and focus on one\u2019s advantages. In other words, developing a new profession meant that one would have a profession that was most suited to one\u2019s current situation.On the other hand, historical professions have been tempered by history and refined through bloody battles, so they would be quite powerful.Zhao Fu decided not to make this decision by himself, and he asked, \u201cBai Qi, what do you think?\u201dBai Qi was not in a hurry to reply. He thought to himself for a while before replying, \u201cYour Majesty, I think that it\u2019s best to go with a military profession that I\u2019m familiar with, rather than creating a new profession.\u201dZhao Fu nodded and asked him about the Unique Military Profession.[Iron Eagle Elite Soldier]: D- grade Military, Description: Great Qin\u2019s most elite soldiers, who not only possess extraordinary swordsmanship but are also proficient in cavalry and infantry battles. Effect: Receives skills [Stage 2 Sword Technique] and [Horsemanship].Since Stage 1 Generals could train soldiers with Unique Military Professions, the number of Generals became quite important. No wonder the General profession could only be unlocked upon raising one\u2019s Village to a Town.Moreover, after reaching Stage 1, every Step that increased Bai Qi\u2019s cultivation would increase all of his stats by +2.Zhao Fu\u2019s cultivation was only at Stage 0-7, and it was still quite far away from Stage 1. His talent at cultivation was quite lacking, but after obtaining King\u2019s Power and Fate\u2019s power, his cultivation speed had already greatly increased.If it wasn\u2019t for the King\u2019s Power and Fate\u2019s power, Zhao Fu was sure that his cultivation would still only be at Stage 0-5. Of course, the strength of a faction did not depend on the Lord\u2019s personal strength but the faction\u2019s overall strength. Apart from Bai Qi, the person with the highest cultivation was Old Logue.Back when Zhao Fu had attacked Logue Village, Old Logue was already at Stage 0-6, and now, he was at the peak of Stage 0-9, only a single step away from Stage 1. He was slightly faster than Zhang Dahu, who was SS grade and joined later than him.Zhao Fu wondered what sort of military profession Old Logue would unlock in the future, and he hoped that it would be a Magic-type profession. Currently, low-grade Magic skills were becoming more and more useless, so Zhao Fu didn\u2019t waste money buying low-grade skills like Fireball. After all, they could be easily blocked by the shields that people used now. The main cities sold high-grade Magic skills, but there were not many of them, making them not as useful.Zhao Fu allowed Bai Qi to pick all of the people who he wanted to train for the Iron Eagle Elite Soldiers, and soon, the exploration teams, who had been out for a few days, returned as well. They brought with them two Normal grade City Creation Stones, and Zhao Fu now had 32 villages under his control. They also reported that they had found an Advanced Outlander Village.This Outlander Village was different to the ones Zhao Fu had found before: the Outlanders this time looked like rats.Zhao Fu was quite interested and gathered his army. After traveling for a little more than a day, he arrived at the Outlander Village.These Outlanders were indeed different. They were about 1.6 meters tall and had humanoid bodies; however, they had rat heads, rat fur, and rat tails.What made Zhao Fu especially surprised was that the Outlander Village seemed to be built next to a historical remnant. The historical remnant looked like a palace, and it was built against a mountain. The stone materials used were a white color, and the structure had mostly collapsed, with only a few sections remaining. The historical remnant looked quite ancient and seemed to be from a long time ago.Zhao Fu was quite delighted, as historical remnants often contained massive benefits.For example, the underground passage and the region of bones could be said to be historical remnants, and now that they had found another one, Zhao Fu couldn\u2019t help but feel excited.However, even without doing anything, the rat people, the Ratfolk, had discovered Zhao Fu\u2019s forces. This was because the Ratfolk were incredibly sensitive to changes in their environment. After all, when rats felt the wind blow or the grass move, they would immediately run.The Ratfolk in the village, who were originally laughing and chatting, suddenly looked serious, and the Ratfolk outside quickly rushed into the village.When Zhao Fu saw that they had been discovered, he smiled and rode Little Black forwards, leading the 10 King\u2019s Undead Cavalrymen behind him and a large number of soldiers and Skeletons.Seeing so many enemies, the Ratfolk within the village immediately started to panic, and they started to speak in their language, worry etched onto their faces.There were roughly 6,000 Ratfolk in the village, and there seemed to be two types of military units: Ratfolk with machetes and Ratfolk with bows and arrows.The village was built right next to the massive historical remnant, and just the walls alone were around 10 meters tall. What\u2019s more, there did not seem to be any doors, only a 2-meter wide hole. It had been completely filled up, making it quite difficult for Zhao Fu to attack.\u201cYour Majesty, what should we do?\u201d Zhang Dahu asked as he cupped his fists respectfully.This time, because Bai Qi was training his Iron Eagle Elite Soldiers, he had remained in the Great Qin Village and had not come with them.Zhao Fu ordered to surround them \u2013 after all, even if Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers attacked, they would not be able to enter. As such, they could only surround them for now. Since the Ratfolk didn\u2019t seem to be a farming race, they would run out of food sooner or later. However, Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers might have to wait a while.Hearing this, Zhang Dahu surrounded the Ratfolk Village with 4,000 soldiers. The Skeletons did not do anything because they did not possess intelligence, while the 10 King\u2019s Undead Cavalrymen only accepted orders from Zhao Fu and no one else.Seeing that they had been surrounded, the Ratfolk chittered to themselves as they looked around warily, seeming to make plans.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, Zhao Fu thought of something and called Zhang Dahu back. He said something to Zhang Dahu and told Little Grey to go along with Zhang Dahu.Within the Ratfolk Village, a few elderly Ratfolk who had white whiskers chittered to each other, and one of them said in their language, \u201cWe\u2019ve been surrounded by humans; what should we do?\u201dAnother elderly Ratfolk replied in a raspy voice, \u201cEven though we\u2019ve stocked up on food, if these humans continue their encirclement, we\u2019ll run out of food sooner or later.\u201d\u201cRight now, we can only fight with those humans and show them how powerful we are,\u201d another elderly Ratfolk said resolutely.\u201cAbsolutely not! That human commands many different races, including Orcs, and he has many types of professions within his army. They have sufficient food, and that human can even command those damned Undead.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We\u2019ll definitely lose,\u201d the elderly Ratfolk who had spoken first rebutted.\u201cWhat do you think we should do then?\u201d asked the one who had wanted to fight.Suddenly, one of the elderly Ratfolk who had not spoken yet finally said, \u201cIn the beginning, didn\u2019t we dig three tunnels to use as contingencies? Right now, we have two options: use those tunnels to slip away\u2026\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, he was cut off by the others. One of them said, \u201cIf we have to escape, we have to take the City Creation Stone with us. However, choosing to relocate will cause too great of a change, and that human will definitely notice. We also can\u2019t leave the City Creation Stone behind. Although we\u2019ve guarded this historical remnant for so long, we\u2019ve only unlocked a small part of it. Do you really want to give all of it away?\u201d\u201cAi!\u201d the Ratfolk who had suggested escaping through the tunnels sighed as he said, \u201cLooks like we\u2019ll have to use the tunnels at night and use our special forces to deal a heavy blow to the Human army.\u201dAll of the other Ratfolk nodded. Right now, there was nothing else that they could do.The sun gradually dipped below the horizon, and a red sunset glow covered the land. Soon, the stars started to shine in the sky.As night completely fell, sparkling stars appeared in the sky, but there was no moon. However, because of the stars, it did not seem too dark.Zhao Fu\u2019s soldiers started to light torches and cook dinner. There didn\u2019t seem to be any wariness within the army, and it was if they didn\u2019t take the Ratfolk seriously at all. In fact, some soldiers even took out wine and started to drink.This caused the Ratfolk sentries on the walls to become quite furious, and they thought to themselves, \u201c _We\u2019ll show these Humans our might soon!_ \u201dThe night deepened, and soon, it was 12 AM. On the face of things, it looked that there were only a few teams patrolling around Zhao Fu\u2019s camp, while everyone else had gone into their tents to sleep.The Ratfolk felt that their opportunity had arrived, and they started to execute their plan.A team of rats passed through the three tunnels and arrived outside the village, with Zhao Fu\u2019s army between them and the village. There were roughly 2,000 Ratfolk in this team, while the Ratfolk on the walls silently lowered ropes.Following this, the Ratfolk on the walls descended from the ropes and positioned themselves on the other side of Zhao Fu\u2019s army. This pincer attack was perfect, and there were no flaws with the plan. If Zhao Fu\u2019s forces were attacked on two sides, they would fall into great danger and would most likely be sent running.The 2,000 Ratfolk behind Zhao Fu\u2019s forces crept out of the tunnels and rushed towards Zhao Fu\u2019s camp, when suddenly\u2026Swish, swish, swish\u2026The sound of the air being torn sounded out, causing the Ratfolk to yell, \u201cAmbush!!\u201dThe Ratfolk immediately scattered, but most of them were still covered by the rain of arrows. A countless number of Ratfolk was shot to death by the chaotically falling arrows.Zhang Dahu came out of hiding and laughed, \u201cHis Majesty was indeed right; the Ratfolk are just like rats and like to dig holes. Luckily, Little Grey\u2019s nose is better than a dog\u2019s, and it discovered these three secret tunnels.\u201d\u201cAwoo!!!\u201dLittle Grey happily howled at Zhang Dahu and bared its teeth, looking as if it was going to bite him. Zhang Dahu looked quite awkward and quickly said, \u201cAlright, alright, I won\u2019t compare your nose to a dog\u2019s nose anymore!\u201d\u201cAwoo!!!\u201d Little Grey continued to howl with displeasure.Zhang Dahu thought about it and realized something, and he said helplessly, \u201cI won\u2019t call you Little Grey either; I\u2019ll call you Grey Wolf King.\u201dTo Little Grey, the name \u2018Little Grey\u2019 could only be used by Zhao Fu, and everyone else could only call it Grey Wolf King.Only then did Little Grey lie on the ground with a satisfied look on its face, and Zhang Dahu turned his gaze back to the battlefield. He saw tens of abnormally agile figures dodge past the dense rain of arrows and escape. Their attire was quite strange, and it looked like they were wearing hoods.Since most of the Ratfolk had been killed, he didn\u2019t order his subordinates to continue shooting arrows. Instead, he took some soldiers to chase after those 10 Ratfolk who had escaped.One hour later, the Ratfolk in front of the walls were still anxiously waiting, wondering what was going on. It was already an hour past the planned time, and it seemed like the group of 2,000 Ratfolk had not made even a single move.Within the Ratfolk Village, the Ratfolk elders paced about anxiously within the Village Hall, wondering what had happened to the team of Ratfolk soldiers. Within their hearts, they felt a trace of uneasiness.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhao Fu\u2019s expression darkened as he looked at Zhang Dahu\u2019s kneeling figure and Little Grey, who looked quite innocent, lying down next to him.After a while, Zhao Fu let out a breath and asked, \u201cSpeak! With 1,500 men, how did you fail to catch some Ratfolk, with even 50 people being injured?\u201dZhang Dahu breathed out before reporting, \u201cYour Majesty, I carried out the ambush as you ordered, and everything went quite smoothly. However, there were tens of Ratfolk who were abnormally agile, and they were able to dodge all of the arrows. They escaped, and of course, I gave the order to chase them down. However, after running into the forest, they were like fish that had returned to the sea, and they disappeared without a trace.\u201cHowever, relying on the Grey Wolf King\u2019s nose, we were able to follow them. However, we didn\u2019t expect them to set an ambush. Of course, we used Your Majesty\u2019s tactics, but unexpectedly, 50 of our brothers were still injured. Despite this, we were able to kill 20 or so of the Ratfolk, but we were unable to find any of the other ones. I\u2019ve already ordered people to hide near the tunnels; as soon as they appear, we\u2019ll kill them immediately.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh? The Ratfolk are that strong?\u201d Zhao Fu said in surprise. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t believe Zhang Dahu, but he simply didn\u2019t expect a few tens of Ratfolk to be so powerful.\u201cYour Majesty, I brought back a few corpses, and you can take a look yourself,\u201d Zhang Dahu said.Zhao Fu nodded, and a few soldiers brought in a few Ratfolk corpses.Zhao Fu had a look and found that they were indeed different compared to normal Ratfolk. They wore black cloaks with hoods, which were large enough to cover their appearances. Underneath the cloaks were tight-fitting clothes that did not restrict their movements, and there was a short sword tied to each of their hands. There were also mechanisms on their arms that could extend and retract the short swords.Zhao Fu used the Corpse Examination skill to look at the corpses, but he found that their grades were all quite average. However, he could not tell what profession they had.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
