Of course, even the outfits were pink, and most of them were mainly dresses.It was evident from the furniture throughout the room that the owner of the room was very spoiled.The room was gorgeous and dreamy, but Su Yunluo didn\u2019t like it too much.Even though she came here on a mission, her mood was important too.So to keep her in a cheerful mood, she had to change the room.Su Yunluo went inside the bathroom. Watching her face reflected in the mirror, she sighed with relief.Su Yunluo believed that her face was already beautiful, but it was still far from the original character.The young girl in the mirror had a palm-sized and pointed melon face, delicate facial features, curved willowy eyebrows, large and watery eyes, a small and beautiful nose, and a red and full cherry mouth that made you want to take a bite.When smiling, her eyes turned crescent-shaped. They were adorable.But the eyes that should have been bright and large were swollen like nuts.Her eyes were still red, and tears remained in the corners.As for something to cry about, it was the female lead\u2019s fianc\u00e9.The woman, Su Yunluo, went to the male lead\u2019s company yesterday for a date but ended up running into him and his woman doing something unspeakable.The female lead asked the male leader angrily, but he fled furiously from her.The heartbroken wife cried all night.The transmigration of Su Yunluo happened the following day.The following story was that the male lead came to ask the female lead for divorce.But this time, it was Su Yunluo. She would never allow that to happen.The male lead was still with his woman despite having a marriage contract, and Su Yunluo felt that behavior inexcusable.So even if she wanted to leave the marriage, she still had to be the one talking about it.Su Yunluo used a warm towel to compress her eyes for some time, making them look less swollen.She opened her wardrobe and chose something not so pink.Then, when she opened the door, she saw a woman\u2019s hand in the air, as if she were about to knock on her door.The lady was stunned for a moment.\u201cHow are you doing?\u201dHer eyes were full of worry.\u201cMommy, I\u2019m all right.\u201d\u00a0 Su Yunluo smiled.The lady was Su Yunluo\u2019s mother, and she adored Su Yunluo a lot.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Let\u2019s go and have breakfast.\u201dHer mother, Su Mu, breathed a sigh of relief.Su Yunluo and Su Mu went downstairs and saw a tall man seated at the dining table.He was reading the newspaper, so his face couldn\u2019t be seen.When the man heard the sound, he put away the paper. He saw the mother and daughter downstairs and smiled.\u201cCome here and eat something.\u201dThe man was about fifty years old, neatly combed black hair, and fine lines crept up at the corners of his eyes, making him more attractive.His eyes were filled with wisdom, involuntarily revealing the sharpness which people dare not underestimate.However, when he looked at his wife and daughter, his eyes were gentle and full of love.That someone was Su Yunluo\u2019s father, Su Su.Su Yunluo greeted her father and sat across from him.Father Su\u2019s curious gaze moved towards Mother Su, who shook her head slightly.After they had their breakfast, Su Yunluo said something that surprised the couple. \u201cMommy and Daddy, let\u2019s go see the Qi family later for a divorce!\u201d\u201cLuoluo, can you tell Mommy what happened to make this decision?\u201d Mother Su worriedly looked at her.Su Yunluo quietly recounted to her parents what happened yesterday. The husband and wife were outraged.\u201cOutrageous! The Qi family is a beast.\u201dFather Su\u2019s face filled with anger.\u201cBut Luoluo, have you considered this carefully?\u201d Mother Su spoke cautiously.Her daughter was fascinated with Qi\u2019s son, while the man had no intention of falling in love with Luoluo.She and Father Su had wanted to break off the marriage contract with the Qi family several times, but Luoluo refused and was determined to think that she would one day move him.Now that she had taken the initiative to break up the marriage, she seemed to have suffered.It was easy to dissolve the marriage contract, but Su Mu was concerned that Su Yunluo would not let him leave.Mommy and Daddy, I\u2019ve already made up my mind. Brother Yunxuan has another woman. He\u2019s not interested in me. That means he doesn\u2019t care about me. He\u2019s not interested in me at all, so I don\u2019t need to force myself on him. I don\u2019t owe him anything. There are plenty of good men out there. I shall always find someone better than him and more worthy of my love and affection.\u201dSu Yunluo seemed calm; there was no teardrop left.However, to them, she was acting strong and was even more distressed for her.\u201cMommy and Daddy, when you go to withdraw the marriage later, don\u2019t talk about what happened yesterday. I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with him after today.\u201d Su Yunluo pleaded.She was also doing that just in case. He had nothing to blame but himself if something came up in the future.After today, she was going to draw a clear line with that trash.It would be none of her business if he and his woman did what they wanted afterward.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom and Dad have a sense of propriety and will never give the Qi family a chance to disturb you again.\u201d Mother Su spoke firmly.\u201cThank you, Mommy and Daddy.\u201d Su Yunluo thanked.\u201cSilly girl, you\u2019re our daughter.

I mistakenly considered the feelings of brothers and sisters to be the feelings of men and women, which caused your misunderstanding and a lot of trouble for brother Yunxuan. I feel terrible about this. Now I\u2019ve thought it over. I\u2019m not in love with brother Yunxuan, so I can\u2019t hold him up. I\u2019m also asking uncle and auntie to agree to cancel our marriage contract.\u201dSu Yunluo sounded like she meant it.Mother Qi turned to the silent Qi Yunxuan who stood at the side.\u201cYunxuan, what\u2019s your opinion?\u201dEveryone looked at him in unison.\u201cDad, mom, I don\u2019t love Miss Su at all.\u201d Qi Yunxuan said slowly.Mother Qi sighed. \u201cSince both children have no such intentions, I think we should cancel the marriage contract.\u201dFather Qi was also very disappointed. \u201cHow unfortunate because Luoluo is so good. Our family is out of luck.\u201d\u201cChildren have their ideas. We can\u2019t do anything.

I wish you a happy life. I\u2019ll leave first if that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201dAfter saying that, Su Yunluo never waited for him to say anything. She turned around and walked out.Qi Yunxuan was in the same spot, somewhat complicated. He found that he never seemed to understand her.At the end of the day, Su Yunluo went to bed, tired. After breaking off the engagement with the male lead, all the resentment in her chest that belonged to the original character had dissipated quite a bit.From an onlooker\u2019s perspective, the male lead, Qi Yunxuan, could be impeccable with good family background and rich and capable.It came as no surprise that the female lead loved him. He was also one of the three young men of the capital; the other two, Su Yunche, the female lead\u2019s brother, a demon who spoiled his sister, and Wen Nan Jin, the world\u2019s affectionate man who loved the female lead with all his heart.These three were all giants that could be the golden tortoise\u2019s son-in-law. They had wealth and power. They were never in a scandal. You could say that they represent good men. No one knew how many women were waiting for marriage.Even though Qi Yunxuan had her as his fianc\u00e9e, those women were still eager for him. They all knew that Qi Yunxuan didn\u2019t love his fianc\u00e9e, so they always stood a chance.Now that she and Qi Yunxuan had broken off their engagement, no one knew how many women\u2019s wishes came true. Sadly, in the original storyline, Qi Yunxuan was taken by the lovely and unpretentious mistress, Mu Yuqing.And she, the female lead, was unfortunate. The male lead had taken the initiative to break off the engagement, and the female lead still had to run between the male lead and the female antagonist\u2019s relationship to be the demon.As a result, the male lead got angry and brought down the Su family. The female lead naturally did not get a good end.\u2018But now I\u2019m not afraid. I have nothing to do with him.\u2019She didn\u2019t have to worry about the Su family collapsing as long as she stayed away from him. In other words, she had made the will of the original character come true.The original character had two more wishes: one was to become a famous fashion designer, and the other was to be with her male counterpart.The man had yet to appear so that she could put a hold on this wish. As for becoming a fashion designer, this was simple.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe original character studied fashion designing and had profound attainments. In the end, she gave up her love of fashion designing for Qi Yunxuan and forced herself to learn all that business knowledge just to help him after marriage.That woman was out of her mind. She had a great future, but she gave it up for a man who didn\u2019t love her. And she changed even the clothing style to suit the male lead, which she didn\u2019t like herself.If she wanted to be a well-known fashion designer, she had to prepare to make a name for herself. The first thing she had to do was change the way she dressed. If a fashion designer couldn\u2019t even wear the right clothes, how could she even start?Tomorrow, she would change all the clothes from her wardrobe. Then she would set up her studio and brand.

The name and brand of the studio were \u201cChlo\u00e9,\u201d which means young and beautiful.The clothes were mainly light and trendy, so the prices were not high, and each piece of clothing was designed by Su Yunluo herself and was limited in quantity.There were also personalized patterns. Su Yunluo would measure the size and design it based on the client\u2019s needs, but the price would be higher.On the day of the opening of the studio, numerous people came to celebrate.

How come I haven\u2019t seen her come over?\u201d Su Yunluo was a bit curious.\u201cShe\u2019s here now,\u201d said Wen Nanjin.\u201cWhere has she gone? I haven\u2019t seen anyone.\u201d Su Yunluo looked around curiously.\u201cRight here in front of me.\u201d Wen Nanjin smiled as she stared at her.Su Yunluo looked surprised, \u201cYou mean me?\u201d\u201cYes, would you do me the honor of attending this charity event?\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d Su Yunluo playfully retorted.\u201cThen I can only go there by myself and then look at others in pairs.\u201d Wen Nanjin joked.\u201cDon\u2019t make yourself look too pathetic.\u201dI can\u2019t promise you that?\u201d Su Yunluo chuckled.\u201cI knew Luoluo cared about me.\u201d\u201cWell, brother Nanjin, wait for me. I\u2019m going to change.\u201dSu Yunluo took another box and went toward the dressing room. Five minutes later, Su Yunluo walked out of the dressing room.Wen Nanjin was in awe of her.

The glasses were staggered, the men held champagne and talked with others, and the ladies met with acquaintances to discuss gossip from the higher classes.Su Yunluo entered the banquet hall holding hands with Wen Nanjin and witnessed such a scene. The people at the banquet also looked at them every once in a while.Su Yunluo could overhear them secretly talking. Even though it was some time ago, the issue of her broken engagement with the Qi family was always a hot topic for them.Su Yunluo didn\u2019t mind, but Wen Nanjin on the side looked at her with concern.\u201cLuoluo, are you alright?\u201dSu Yunluo smiled sweetly, \u201cBrother Nanjin, I\u2019m fine. They can say anything they want. It\u2019s not going to affect me at all.\u201dWen Nanjin saw that there was nothing wrong with her. He felt relief and brought her to the people she knew well.The friends\u2019 Wen Nanjin made were all representatives of the clean upper-class circles, so Su Yunluo was pleased to meet them.She saw her good friend, and after talking to Wen Nanjin, she went looking for her.\u201cZhenzhen,\u201d Su Yunluo smiled and greeted a sweet-looking girl.Ye Zhenzhen was equally happy to see her, \u201cLuoluo, how did you get here?\u201d\u201cBrother Nanjin invited me, so I came over,\u201d Su Yunluo explained with a smile.Ye Zhenzhen was one of her good sisters. Her social circle was not large, just five or six sisters, but they really treated Su Yunluo sincerely.When they broke off the engagement, every one of them called or went to her place to comfort her, making Su Yunluo very touched.\u201cAre all of them here?\u201d Su Yunluo was talking about the other sisters.\u201cThey\u2019re over there. I\u2019m going to take you there.\u201d Ye Zhenzhen led Su Yunluo towards them.Some people chatted enthusiastically, and the laughter kept on. At that point, there was a commotion across the door.Su Yunluo looked over, and it was Qi Yunxuan who had brought his partner, Mu Yuqing.Mu Yuqing\u2019s appearance was of a delicate style, giving a fragile feeling, the kind that men liked a lot. She wore a little lake green dress with very light make-up on her face.Standing alongside the great Qi Yunxuan, she seemed very small. She looked as if she was at the banquet for the first time.Her expression was a little uneasy. The girl bit her lips unconsciously.

What\u2019s the point of pretending to be weak,\u201d Ye Zhenzhen\u2019s tone was somewhat contemptuous.Su Yunluo felt a bit funny, \u201cZhenzhen, don\u2019t talk about people like that even if you don\u2019t like them.\u201d\u201cBut people really think she is really good,\u201d Ye Zhenzhen pouted.She didn\u2019t really like that kind of girl who was very weak and would do nothing and needed to be looked after. She rather appreciated independent girls.Su Yunluo shook her head and had to allow her to do so. She didn\u2019t feel like it, but the other 1,000 girls in attendance and Ye Zhenzhen felt the same way.Hearing them, they seemed not to like Mu Yuqing\u2019s weak appearance. Mu Yuqing appeared to be very unpopular.After a moment, Su Yunluo\u2019s eyes fell on Qi Yunxuan walking toward them with Mu Yuqing.\u201cMiss Su,\u201d Qi Yunxuan stood three steps away from her and greeted lightly.\u201cYoung Master Qi,\u201d Su Yunluo was very cold as well.\u201cMiss Su, she\u2019s my partner, Mu Yuqing.\u201dQi Yunxuan didn\u2019t care about Su Yunluo\u2019s cold attitude and introduced Mu Yuqing to her.\u201cQingqing, this is Miss Su Yunluo.\u201dWhen Qi Yunxuan introduced Su Yunluo to Mu Yuqing, she actually heard a little gentleness.

Aren\u2019t you angry, Luoluo?\u201d Ye Zhenzhen was confused.Although Luoluo already said that she didn\u2019t like Qi Yunxuan, but after all, it was once her fianc\u00e9. Even though she wouldn\u2019t get mad, Ye Zhenzhen would.\u201cWhy be angry? These people have nothing to do with me. They\u2019re none of my business.\u201dSu Yunluo smiled.

That was when Qi Yunxuan started a conversation with her, \u201cMiss Su, thank you for helping Qing Qing last time.\u201dSu Yunluo was stunned, \u201cYou are welcome, but Master Qi is not very competent. You just left Miss Mu there. Next time, watch out. After all, not everyone is as kind as me.\u201d Su Yunluo joked.Qi Yunxuan did not answer her.After sitting for a while longer, she felt a bit hot and thought that the air-conditioning temperature wasn\u2019t low enough, so she turned it down a bit.Therefore, the longer she sat, the hotter she got.It was as though her face was burning, with a rapid heartbeat.Realizing that something was wrong, Su Yunluo left the room in a hurry.[System, what\u2019s wrong with me?]Su Yunluo was hot as hell.

Your points are not enough.] The System spoke weakly.Su Yunluo was about to freak out. \u2018This system is too unreliable.\u2019She suppressed her anger, [Then tell me, what should I do?][Host, you can get a man to de-medicate you.][That\u2019s an excellent suggestion.] Su Yunluo gritted her teeth.She no longer knew what to do.Subconsciously, she had Wen Nanjin in mind.Her body was getting hotter and hotter.

Her eyes regained a little clarity and saw that it was Qi Yunxuan standing before her.She must have been hallucinating and saw a hint of worry in this man\u2019s eyes.Earlier, Qi Yunxuan had already noticed that something was wrong with her and felt that it was better to follow her and take a look.Now that she looked like that, it was apparent she was spiked.\u201cYou\u2026 \u201d Qi Yunxuan wanted to come closer, but she stopped by him.\u201cDon\u2019t come over\u2026 The voice was sweet and not at all daunting.Su Yunluo withstood desperately the urge to jump at him.

That person was finally fired, and no company dared to hire him. He could only leave the city in disgrace to earn a living elsewhere.Su Yunluo was busy in the studio as usual.

So she asked Wen Nanjin to order. Wen Nanjin asked Su Yunluo what to avoid and then ordered the unique dishes there.In less than 20 minutes, the dishes were served. Steamed scallops with garlic vermicelli, baby vegetables in soup, boiled shrimp, plum cabbage with pork, and two unique Cantonese dishes.Wen Nanjin was very happy to know that she was satisfied with her meal.

Mother Qi had never heard of Mu Yuqing before, and suddenly she heard that he wanted to marry her.Mu Yuqing was not worthy of him, no matter what! Mother Qi, in her heart, decided that it was all Mu Yuqing who had encouraged Qi Yunxuan to climb up to their family.Luoluo heard that the mother and son were at loggerheads over this, and Qi Yunxuan hadn\u2019t been home for many days.But Su Yunluo just listened and left it at that.

Usually, both of them were pretty busy with work.He made time always to meet up with her. Little surprises, small gifts, and such were even more readily available. Everything about her, he was very attentive.As long as she said that a certain thing was pretty, that thing would appear in front of her the next day.Under the man\u2019s pampering, Su Yunluo felt very happy every day, loving him more and more each day.She sometimes wondered what kind of virtue and ability she had to be favored by him.

It didn\u2019t look too monotonous.There was a large floor-to-ceiling window in the living room there that led to a large balcony. Many green pot plants were planted, and all of them were growing well. It was clear that the owner of the house had taken good care of them.Su Yunluo went to the kitchen again.

Unlike me, I can\u2019t do it.\u201d Su Yunluo was a bit envious.Although she could also cook, what she made was only enough to fill her stomach.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.

The two each ordered a cup of something, then the waiter retired.\u201cI wonder what Miss Mu is looking for me here.\u201dSu Yunluo felt a bit strange. She was working in the studio today, and suddenly she received a call from Mu Yuqing, saying that she had something to say to her. She had no idea where Mu Yuqing got her contact information.\u201cMiss Su, I\u2019m sorry to bother you. I got your contact information from Yunxuan\u2019s phone because I\u2019ve been feeling very distressed lately. It is hard to find someone to talk to. I thought maybe Miss Su could help me out.\u201d Mu Yuqing was quite embarrassed.\u201cMay I hear more about it.\u201d Su Yunluo calmly looked at her.Mu Yuqing slowly spoke, \u201cMiss Su, I was born in a very ordinary family. Both my parents are ordinary employees of a small company. Although life is poor, our family is happy. I was lucky enough to join the Qi Corporation after graduating from college. I worked in the administration department as a little assistant. I thought I was just going to wait until I was old enough to find a man to fall in love with and then get married, have kids, and live a normal life.

The president fell in love with me. First, I also found it strange. I did not want to have anything to do with him. I was aware that the president was beyond my reach. Even though I thought so, I still wasn\u2019t invincible to the president\u2019s pursuit and fell in love with him regardless.\u201d\u201cMiss Su, you may not believe it, but I really didn\u2019t know originally that you were the president\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. It was you who came to the president\u2019s office that time and you ran into the president and me\u2026\u201d Mu Yuqing blushed.\u201cWhen I found out, I was so mad at being cheated on and broke up with him, but the president wouldn\u2019t. He even came to my house to stop me. After that, he broke off his engagement with you. I struggled for a long time but got back together with him.\u201dMu Yuqing\u2019s voice gradually became bitter. \u201cThe president later proposed to me and took me to meet Aunt Qi. Aunt Qi disapproved of our marriage, so the president moved out in anger and lived with me. Then I got pregnant. She suspected that the child in my belly was of another man. Aunt Qi only reluctantly agreed. She insisted on waiting until I gave birth and had a paternity test before allowing us to have the wedding.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For the sake of the child in my belly, I can endure anything. But for what did my parents do wrong? They came to see a glimpse of me, but they were all ruthlessly thrown out by her. Originally I was unwed and pregnant. I had already made my parents unable to hold their heads up. Now I have to drag them into being taunted.

The president and I are in two different worlds. Even if I marry him smoothly now, there will still be conflicts in the future. I\u2019m tired. I don\u2019t want to live like this. Aunt Qi is right. Miss Su is the one who can match the president.\u201d\u201cMiss Mu, how nosy of me to ask, but what about the child in your belly after you and Qi Yunxuan broke up?\u201d Su Yunluo asked her calmly.\u201cI will raise the child myself.

Who are you to make decisions for us?\u201d Su Yunluo spoke.She seemed to have not expected Su Yunluo to say something like that. Mu Yuqing was a bit at a loss as to how to reply.\u201cAlso, have you thought seriously about the child? Even if I\u2019m with Qi Yunxuan, but you have his child. Do you think he\u2019ll let you guys go? Will Aunt Qi ignore it? Besides, now that everyone out there knows about you, do you think it\u2019s okay to just hide away? What will you do when you\u2019re found? Will you continue to hide with your child? What will your child think of all this?\u201d Su Yunluo continued to speak.Mu Yuqing really didn\u2019t think so much about it.

The woman\u2019s moans were more than a scream. A cry that drove the man mad with desire.He turned her head around and sealed her lips on where those seductive moans came out. His tongue wantonly stuck into her mouth, and the action of thrusting underneath became increasingly violent.\u201cUmmm,\u201d Su Yunluo\u2019s mouth was blocked and could only make this sound.Her two legs were trembling, and she could hardly stand, solely relying on Wen Nanjin to support her waist.Their bodies were so tightly united that the crimson shaft as thick as a baby\u2019s arm was vaguely visible pumping through the pink slit.The two pink labia were now red and were relentlessly pushed to the sides by the man\u2019s penis that her p*ssy struggling to swallow!Each time the man\u2019s huge c*ck was pushed in, her flat belly was bulging.

He poured some hot water into the bottle, then scooped up the milk powder and shook it well. Then he tested the temperature before giving it to little Muhan.Little Muhan held the bottle. His little red mouth bit and sucked on the nipple, feeding on his food.A small cry sounded again in the nursery. Wen Nanjin was about to walk over, but Su Yunluo took one step ahead of him, picking up Wen Muya. She coaxed, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry\u2026 Mommy is here\u2026\u201dWhereas little Muhan had finished his milk and was closing his eyes to go back to sleep. Wen Nanjin lulled him to sleep and carried him back to his crib.\u201cMuya is hungry. I\u2019ll go make milk for her.\u201dShe nodded. Not long after, Wen Nanjin returned.He slipped the milk bottle into little Muya\u2019s arms. She was so hungry that she held the bottle and gulped down the milk. Soon, that bottle of milk saw the end.Su Yunluo patted her gently and waited for her to fall asleep before putting her back in the crib.Looking at the sleeping babies in each of the two cribs, the couple\u2019s faces were all smiles of happiness. The couple went to wash up for breakfast, then went back to their room to change clothes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wen Nanjin and Su Yunluo each had a baby carrier on their backs and went out.The hospital was overcrowded, so Wen Nanjin went to the front desk to register in the pediatric department.She frowned slightly when she looked at the number plate in her hand. There were more than a dozen people in front of her. It took half an hour of waiting in the pediatric department before it was the couple\u2019s turn.Su Yunluo carried Wen Muya inside first. The doctor checked the baby\u2019s health and gave her a prophylactic injection.After the vaccination, little Muya cried loudly. Su Yunluo was heartbroken and hugged her to coax her.\u201cIs Muya okay?\u201d Wen Nanjin looked worried.\u201cJust scared by the injection. I\u2019ll coax Muya, and she\u2019ll be fine. You can carry Muhan in.\u201d Su Yunluo said.Wen Nanjin nodded. It was hard to coax little Muya to stop crying.A woman\u2019s sharp voice could be heard not far away.\u201cHow do you take care of a child? You take care of him to the point where he\u2019s sick!\u201dThe other woman\u2019s voice desperately said she was sorry. She didn\u2019t mean to do it. A child\u2019s cry mixed in the background.Little Muya was frightened. Her mouth compressed to cry.Su Yunluo hurriedly patted her back to coax her, subconsciously raising her head to see who it was. The result was that she saw Mother Qi, Mu Yuqing, and her son.The three people on the other side also saw her.Mother Qi came over to greet her first, \u201cSo it\u2019s Luoluo, long time no see.\u201d\u201cAunt Qi\u2026 \u201cSu Yunluo softly greeted.\u201cI heard that you gave birth to a pair of dragon and phoenix babies. What a blessing. Is this a girl or the other baby?\u201d Mother Qi looked at the child in her arms and asked.\u201cThis one is a girl, and the other one is at Nanjin\u2019s. He is getting vaccinated in the pediatric department.\u201d Su Yunluo smiled.Looking at the blushing Wen Muya, Mother Qi was not without envy.\u201cYou\u2019ve done such a good job with the baby. Look how healthy she looks, unlike my grandson. He was brought up sickly by his mother.\u201dMu Yuqing, who was behind Mother Qi, remained quiet upon hearing the remark and only held the child in her arms tightly.Qi Yunxuan and Mu Yuqing\u2019s son was one and a half years old and was born prematurely.According to the rumor, Mu Yuqing had a big fight with Qi Yunxuan over something. As a result, she had a premature delivery.The child was held in the stomach for a bit too long during the delivery. Thus the child had birth defects and spent his days running at the hospital.Su Yunluo glanced at the child in Mu Yuqing\u2019s arms. The little boy was skinny and small. His face was sickly, and he looked terrified of people. He shrank timidly into Mu Yuqing\u2019s arms all the time.Su Yunluo only glanced and withdrew her gaze.\u201cLuoluo.\u201dWen Muhan was done with his vaccination, Wen Nanjin carried him out. Su Yunluo turned back, and Wen Nanjin brought Wen Muhan towards her.\u201cI met Aunt Qi at the hospital and chatted for a while.\u201d Su Yunluo said.Wen Nanjin politely greeted.\u201cAuntie Qi, we\u2019ll be leaving first.\u201d Su Yunluo bid goodbye to Mother Qi.Afterward, Su Yunluo once again heard about the Qi family\u2019s recent developments. The two were getting a divorce.The divorce was proposed by Mu Yuqing, but Qi Yunxuan refused. The couple was having a lot of drama about it.After a month of stalemate, the two still divorced, and the child went to Mu Yuqing\u2019s custody. It was heard that Mother Qi was planning to file a lawsuit against Mu Yuqing for the child\u2019s custody.When Su Yunluo heard this, she just smiled faintly and didn\u2019t make any comments. After all, that was someone else\u2019s family matter and had nothing to do with her.Looking at the baby who was teething beside her, Su Yunluo softly smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not long after his 80th birthday, Wen Nanjin passed away due to illness. Immediately after he left, Su Yunluo also left the mission world.\u201cHost, don\u2019t be sad.\u201dLooking at Su Yunluo\u2019s silent expression, the system was a little worried.Su Yunluo didn\u2019t respond to it. The little bits and pieces of her and Wen Nanjin\u2019s past constantly surfacing in her head.Wen Nanjin spoiled her to the extreme. After so many years of their marriage, Wen Nanjin had never lost his temper with Su Yunluo.Although it was only a mission world, Su Yunluo was indeed in love and spent a lifetime with him. With such a bone-deep affection, how could she forget?\u201cSystem, is there a way to seal my memories of this life?\u201d Only after a long time did Su Yunluo speak.Leaving her to capture others with her feelings for Wen Nanjin, Su Yunluo couldn\u2019t do it. It wasn\u2019t fair to anyone else. Thinking about it, she could only let the system seal her memories away.Although she was very reluctant, Su Yunluo believed they would meet again when she returned to the real world!\u201cHost, this is a potion to seal your memories. After you drink it, you will forget your feelings for your partner.\u201dThe system took out the potion. Su Yunluo picked it up and slowly swallowed the blue liquid from the glass bottle into her mouth.After swallowing it, Su Yunluo\u2019s memory of past sweetness with Wen Nanjin gradually faded away. Wen Nanjin was now a captured character to her.\u201cSystem, drop me to the next world,\u201d Su Yunluo\u2019s eyes were clear now.After a short while, she was sent to the next mission world.The alarm went off at eight in the morning, and Su Yunluo opened her eyes on time. She sat up from her bed and moved her gaze to the nightstand at the side. There was a white note lying quietly there.She picked it up and looked at the man\u2019s powerful handwriting.Luoluo, I\u2019m off on a business trip. I\u2019ll be back in a week. Breakfast is ready on the table. Make sure you eat it!Su Yunluo, in pajamas, shuffled along with a pair of slippers in the direction of the bathroom.There was already toothpaste squeezed on the pink toothbrush at the sink. The mouthwash cup was filled with water, and the towel was ready on the side.Su Yunluo just needed to brush her teeth and wash her face. After washing up, Su Yunluo looked at herself in the mirror.Delicate and appealing features, a standard melon face, curved willowy eyebrows, big bright eyes, beautiful nose, red cherry lips, and a pair of shallow pear edges cheeks: A classic beauty.Su Yunluo sat in front of the dining table. On it were soft glutinous rice porridge, a set of tiny steamed buns, and a cup of still-hot soybean milk.After having the soft rice porridge and a bite of the small dumpling, Su Yunluo squinted her eyes in pleasure.Soon, she finished her delicious breakfast.Today was the weekend. Su Yunluo didn\u2019t have to work, so she walked around the house. A three-room, two-bedroom layout and decorated in a continental style.The kitchen was open and fully stocked with cooking utensils. The refrigerator was divided and filled with fresh food, so you could tell that the house owner cooked a lot.The living room had large floor-to-ceiling windows that opened onto a brightly spacious balcony with lovely tiny potted plants. The walls were beautifully framed with abstract images. It also had some excellent knick-knacks on the coffee table, which was very much in the mood of life.Inside the master bedroom, a huge-sized dark blue bed with matching bedding was in sight.Next to the king-size bed was a dresser with a few cosmetics and skincare products on it. The drawers were empty.There was also a dressing room in the master bedroom, with all kinds of clothes neatly placed in different categories.After touring the house, Su Yunluo concluded that the house owner paid a lot of attention to the quality of life.The apartment belonged to a man named Gu Yiyin. The woman who owned it was none other than Su Yunluo, the original character. The latter had been his girlfriend for three years.The original character Su Yunluo was from H city, studied in B city and stayed in B city to work after graduation.Gu Yiyin was a local of B City, graduated from the same university as Su Yunluo, and was one year older than her.Gu Yiyin studied architecture. In his second year of college, he and his roommate founded an architectural firm together.He excelled in architecture. In just three years, the company developed and was listed as successful.When Su Yunluo graduated from college, Gu Yiyin as the representative of an outstanding senior brother, was invited to the school to confer a position to his junior brothers and sisters.Gu Yiyin fell in love with Su Yunluo at first sight and then aggressively moved to woo her. After chasing her for half a year, Su Yunluo agreed to be Gu Yiyin\u2019s girlfriend, making him overjoyed.The two moved in together as a matter of course. Gu Yiyin spoiled Su Yunluo to the skies. Gu Yiyin drove to and from work, rain, or shine. Every now and then, she\u2019d get a little romantic surprise.When he saw a pretty thing that suited her, he would buy it without blinking his eyes, no matter how expensive it was.There was no need for Su Yunluo to do anything, even at home. He alone handled almost all the household chores.Such a handsome and wealthy boyfriend who loved her dearly. If it were any other woman, she would have been laughing long ago.Unfortunately, Su Yunluo didn\u2019t love him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That person was her brother, Su Yunting, who was three years older and shared the same biological father as her.Su Yunluo always liked to stick behind Su Yunting since she was young and was often laughed at by her parents, who called her brother\u2019s \u201cfollower.\u201dHowever, Su Yunting was cold by nature. He was also insensitive to Su Yunluo, his only sister.However, Su Yunluo didn\u2019t care and still followed him. Somewhere along the line, Su Yunluo found herself falling in love with Su Yunting.Su Yunluo was initially alarmed at the fact that she was in love with her brother. She tried to not love him, yet she found that she couldn\u2019t.In the end, she decided to confess her love for Su Yunting. Expectedly, Su Yunting rejected her to the point of absolute indifference.Su Yunluo was heartbroken and chose to go to college in the next city, B, to escape this sad place for a while.During college, countless boys were chasing after her, but she didn\u2019t accept any of them. Later after she graduated, Gu Yiyin pursued her for half a year.Su Yunluo saw that Gu Yiyin was excellent, plus she also wanted to forget Su Yunting, so she agreed.However, despite how good Gu Yiyin was to her, Su Yunluo found that she still couldn\u2019t forget Su Yunting.In the original plot, Gu Yiyin and Su Yunluo dated for three years. When Gu Yiyin returned from his business trip, Su Yunluo was going to break up with him.When she heard this, Su Yunluo had to curse the original character for being \u201cstupid.\u201d She would let such a good boyfriend go and had to fall in love with her brother. It would be fine if Su Yunting liked her, but he didn\u2019t like her.Not only did the original character\u2019s actions hurt Gu Yiyin, but she also wronged her parents, the Su family.\u201cWhat will the host do next?\u201d The System asked in a childlike voice.\u201cWhat else can I do? He is such a great guy. I definitely can\u2019t break up with him! It is best to be with him.\u201dBut after looking around the house once more, Su Yunluo sighed helplessly. It seemed the original character really didn\u2019t like Gu Yiyin at all.There were very few things in the entire house that belonged to her, unlike where the young lovers lived together.Also, it had been a three-year relationship, but the original character, Su Yunluo, didn\u2019t even know Gu Yiyin\u2019s birthday.Neither did she know what Gu Yiyin liked or didn\u2019t like, and she didn\u2019t buy him anything. It was always Gu Yiyin who was paying.As Gu Yiyin\u2019s girlfriend, this was too much of a dereliction of duty even if she didn\u2019t like him. With nothing else to do, Su Yunluo cleaned the house.Just like that, a morning passed. Su Yunluo showered, changed into a skirt, picked up her bag, and left the house.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The moment he stepped into the house, he was stunned for a moment. For no other reason, he saw Su Yunluo cooking in the kitchen.The two had been dating for so long, yet Su Yunluo had never done any hands-on cooking. He had always been the one cooking at home. Therefore, seeing her cooking in the kitchen, Gu Yiyin was surprised.Su Yunluo hadn\u2019t noticed Gu Yiyin\u2019s return. She was wearing a pink bear apron, happily chopping carrots and humming an unknown song softly. She was skilled with her knife and quickly sliced a carrot into beautiful shreds.At that moment, she finally sensed someone was looking at her. When Su Yunluo raised her head, she saw a man standing a short distance away with a suitcase beside him. The man saw her raise her head and smiled at her; it was Gu Yiyin.Gu Yiyin\u2019s figure was tall and straight. The kind of refined type handsome man. His eyes were as deep and charming as the sea; his high nose, thin lips, and face were firm but soft. Especially when he smiled at you with his eyes full of affection, it was really something.Gu Yiyin slowly walked towards her.Su Yunluo finally came back to her senses and adjusted her mood. Raising her head, she smiled lightly, \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d\u201cWell, I was going to take you out to dinner, but I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d cook. Looks like I\u2019m in luck tonight.\u201d Gu Yiyin teased.Su Yunluo blushed slightly, \u201cGo put your luggage away first. I\u2019ll fry up two more dishes, and you can eat them soon.\u201dWhen Gu Yiyin returned to the bedroom, Su Yunluo was relieved. She almost dropped her cover. Fortunately, the original Su Yunluo knew how to cook, or else she would have been exposed.When Gu Yiyin came out of the bedroom, Su Yunluo was untying her apron. Seeing him, Su Yunluo smiled and spoke, \u201cYou can eat now.\u201dThe two sat down at the dining table. Su Yunluo manually scooped him a bowl of rice, \u201cHurry up and eat.\u201dSu Yunluo made four dishes and one soup. Those were very common home-cooked dishes.Gu Yiyin put a piece of ribs in his mouth. It was sweet and sour, and the meat was tender and delicious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Next time you want to eat something, let me know. I\u2019ll make it for you.\u201dSu Yunluo was confident. Gu Yiyin smiled and nodded. The two of them had an enjoyable dinner. After dinner, Su Yunluo got up to clean up the dishes.Gu Yiyin stopped her, \u201cYou sit down, I\u2019ll clean up.\u201dSo, Su Yunluo ran to the living room to watch TV. He put away the dishes into the kitchen. After washing the dishes, he cut a plate of fruit out.Su Yunluo watched TV seriously and didn\u2019t notice that Gu Yiyin had already come out of the kitchen.\u201cHave a piece of apple.\u201d Gu Yiyin forked over a piece of apple to her.Only then did Su Yunluo realize that Gu Yiyin was sitting next to her.She took the apple, said \u201cthank you\u201d in passing, and turned around to continue watching TV.The TV played an idol drama, an old-fashioned love story between a poor girl and a CEO. Although the plot was clich\u00e9d, the main characters\u2019 face value was high, so the ratings increased.The general audience watched these dogged romance dramas. While some spat at it, Su Yunluo was the same. As she watched, she talked to Gu Yiyin and then guessed the following plot.When other men watched these idol dramas with their girlfriends, they usually felt childish and bored. They would leave to do other things after sitting for less than a few minutes.Gu Yiyin was different, though, and was able to discuss the plot with Su Yunluo. He commented on the characters\u2019 lines and made a lot of sense, which Su Yunluo admired.After watching two episodes of the idol drama, it was almost ten o\u2019clock. The two went to the bathroom to shower one after another.When Su Yunluo came out of the bathroom, Gu Yiyin handed her a beautiful box, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Su Yunluo curiously took it.\u201cA gift for you. Open it, and see if you like it.\u201d Gu Yiyin smiled.Su Yunluo opened the box, and there was a very ancient necklace lying quietly inside, looking very timeless. On the back of the necklace\u2019s pendant was written a string of unreadable words.Su Yunluo raised her head and asked Gu Yiyin, \u201cWhat does the text behind this mean?\u201dGu Yiyin explained, \u201cIt\u2019s a very ancient script. It means I love three things in this world, the sun and the moon. The sun is the morning, the moon in the evening, and you are the morning and the evening. The original version of this phrase was originally in English, but later it was translated into this ancient script.\u201d\u201cSo romantic.\u201d Su Yunluo\u2019s tone was filled with envy.\u201cThis necklace is a couple\u2019s pair. I also have one,\u201d finished saying; Gu Yiyin quietly observed her reaction.\u201cSo it\u2019s a lovers\u2019 necklace. I like it. Thank you for bringing me a gift.\u201d Su Yunluo smiled sweetly.Seeing that Su Yunluo did indeed like the necklace, Gu Yiyin breathed a sigh of relief and looked at her with even more tenderness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those things where they dated, the little gifts he prepared for her, little surprises, and so on.She couldn\u2019t even mention her interest. Her expression turned bland.The two had been dating for three years. Although they lived together, Gu Yiyin always felt more like sharing a room than boyfriend and girlfriend.But now, it was different. Su Yunluo would take the initiative to care about him. She would also start to put in the effort to decorate the house.The things in the house that belonged to them were becoming increasingly numerous. Although he didn\u2019t know why she had changed, Gu Yiyin was happy about it.This weekend, Gu Yiyin was going to a party at a friend\u2019s house. Few other friends of his would be there as well. They had agreed to bring their families.He asked Su Yunluo\u2019s opinion, and she agreed. By Saturday evening, Su Yunluo changed her clothes and followed Gu Yiyin out.In the car, the two chatted with each other.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be too bad if we go empty-handed like this?\u201dSu Yunluo raised her head and asked him.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re all friends. We don\u2019t care about that.\u201dGu Yiyin smiled at her.\u201cHow is your friend? Do you get along well?\u201dSu Yunluo was a bit nervous. It felt like she was going to meet her boyfriend\u2019s parents. When Gu Yiyin saw how nervous she was, he was a little amused and warmed up.\u2018She must be concerned about me to want to leave a good impression.\u2019He comforted her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they are very nice people and won\u2019t do anything to you. If they dare to bully you, then I\u2019ll help you bully back.\u201dSpeaking of which, he made a fierce face. Su Yunluo was amused by him and relaxed a lot. They laughed and chatted about other topics.By the time Gu Yiyin and Su Yunluo arrived, everyone else was already there. They were the last two to come.A man walked up first to greet Gu Yiyin, \u201cYiyin, long time no see.\u201d\u201cLong time no see.\u201dGu Yiyin smiled and greeted.The others also came up to greet her.Su Yunluo looked at them curiously as Gu Yiyin introduced her in a low voice, \u201cThey\u2019re all my friends from childhood. This is Zhang Hua, Li Haoyang, this is\u2026\u201dHe introduced them from left to right and then introduced Su Yunluo to the group, \u201cThis is my girlfriend, Su Yunluo.\u201d\u201cHello, I\u2019m Su Yunluo,\u201d she smiled lightly at them.\u201cHello, sis.\u201d\u201cSo sister-in-law is so beautiful. Yiyin is truly blessed.\u201dThe people were poking fun at each other in various ways, causing Su Yunluo to feel a little embarrassed.\u201cWhere are the sisters-in-law?\u201dGu Yiyin asked again about the group\u2019s family members.\u201cThey\u2019re all working in the kitchen.\u201dOne of them pointed in the direction of the kitchen. Gu Yiyin took Su Yunluo over to the kitchen to greet them. These women had all met Gu Yiyin at previous gatherings, so they weren\u2019t strangers to him.However, Su Yunluo and the others met her for the first time and felt curious about her. After a few greetings, Su Yunluo offered to come help in the kitchen.\u201cYiyin, go out. I\u2019ll be here to help my sisters-in-law.\u201d\u201cCan you do that?\u201dGu Yiyin was a little uneasy. Su Yunluo nodded. One of the women laughed and poked fun at Gu Yiyin.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep an eye on my younger sister-in-law for you. I\u2019ll never let her get eaten.\u201dThe other women laughed at the statement. Su Yunluo blushed and pushed Gu Yiyin out of the kitchen.Women\u2019s friendships were easy to establish, and they became familiar with each other in a few words.Su Yunluo was the youngest and very talkative. She was not the trying-hard-kind. As a result, it was easy to gain these women\u2019s favorability.A group of women worked together in the kitchen. They were laughing and working together to create a feast.The group of men sat down at the table. Zhang Hua let out an exaggerated exclamation, \u201cWow, what a sumptuous dinner. We can have a full meal tonight.\u201d\u201cMost of these dishes are made by Luoluo. You guys have to eat them well.\u201dZhang Hua\u2019s girlfriend smiled.\u201cYeah? Yiyin is the only one who can cook, so I guess my sister-in-law is a good cook too. Then, by all means\u2026\u201dThe group of people moved their chopsticks and began to eat.From the first bite, they couldn\u2019t stop. They exclaimed as they ate, praising Su Yunluo\u2019s cooking skills even more than a five-star chef.As a result, Su Yunluo left a good impression in the hearts of these men with her exquisite cooking skills.Tonight\u2019s dishes were all seafood. Such an excellent cook. Su Yunluo was a fan of seafood, especially crabs, except she was a little helpless in shelling crabs.Gu Yiyin saw this and silently peeled the crab shells, putting the crab meat into her bowl.Not only that, but all other seafood that needs to be peeled, Gu Yiyin did it for her. She only had to eat whatever she wanted.It was a sight that other women envied. They looked at their man, who was only concerned with eating only by themselves.Each one of them stared angrily at their man, leaving a group of men confused.

Several women discussed the game and finally settled that the loser of each round should be punished with lemon juice.There happened to be lemons in the fridge. The women grabbed their lemons out, sliced them up, and put them in the blender. The yellow color looked sour at first glance.The first round started. The cards that Su Yunluo got were not bad.

She drank two or three glasses and smiled like a little fox.The women were very \u201cunconvinced.\u201d Just as the lemon juice ran out, they switched to another form of punishment: drawing on their faces with a brush.Su Yunluo probably ran out of luck. She lost several games in a row later. Now the other women will have their revenge. They all picked up their brushes and drew on her face.When Gu Yiyin came over, she just happened to lose again and had to accept the punishment obediently.When Gu Yiyin saw this, he wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dSu Yunluo turned around and looked at him with an aggrieved face.On her small and delicate face were two big panda eyes, three whiskers on each side of her cheeks, and the word \u201cking\u201d written on her forehead. Several animals also appeared on her face, making her look ridiculous.When Gu Yiyin saw it, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh out, \u201cHow did you become like this?\u201dHe said, \u201cI\u2019m going to help you wipe it off.\u201dWhen the women saw this, they all spoke out to stop.\u201cNo, oh! It\u2019s a punishment for losing. You can\u2019t erase it.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, wait until you get home to erase it.\u201dThe men chimed in.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take it easy on her? Look at what you\u2019ve painted on our sister-in-law\u2019s face.\u201d\u201cYeah, Yiyin must be heartbroken.\u201dAggrieved, Su Yunluo looked at Gu Yiyin.\u201cTell the truth.\u201d\u201cThey \u2018bullied\u2019 me. You have to help me.\u201dGu Yiyin smiled dotingly while stroking the top of her head, \u201cOkay.\u201dSo the women all withdrew, and the men joined the fray. The one who lost had to be painted with patterns on the faces of the respective women.Gu Yiyin was very competitive and didn\u2019t lose a single hand. Seeing the women looking dejected, Su Yunluo was happy.Turning into a little fangirl, she adoringly looked at Gu Yiyin. It was as if she had stars in her eyes.\u201cHow awesome.\u201dGu Yiyin smiled and remained silent. When he looked at Su Yunluo, his eyes were so gentle that they could drip water.Su Yunluo gleefully painted the women\u2019s faces. The party ended with a group photo.She was probably tired from playing and fell asleep in the car on the way back. Gu Yiyin gripped the steering wheel steadily with one hand and let her head rest on his shoulder with the other. Su Yunluo slightly adjusted her posture and fell asleep at ease.Back home, Gu Yiyin placed Su Yunluo against the couch.He went to the bathroom to get some warm water. He soaked a clean towel in water, then wrung it out and wiped the ink off Su Yunluo\u2019s face.The whole process was done carefully, for fear of waking her up. At last, the cleanliness and fairness of Su Yunluo\u2019s face were back.She had smooth and tender skin, similar to that of a shelled egg. The slightest bit of pressure would leave a mark.Gu Yiyin\u2019s fingertips gently traced Su Yunluo\u2019s delicate face. They lingered a moment longer when he touched the soft red lips.Unable to resist the inner urge to kiss her, little by little, he got closer. Then, his thin lips kissed her red lips. He kissed very lightly and with restraint. He was careful not to wake her up.But her soft lips made it difficult for him to restrain himself. He couldn\u2019t help but use some force.At that point, Su Yunluo opened her eyes and looked at the handsome face zooming before her. There was no reaction to what was happening for a moment.Seeing that she was awake, Gu Yiyin then let go of her.\u201cSorry to wake you up.\u201dStill a little confused, the bewilderment in her eyes not yet receding.\u201cAre we home?\u201dThere was a softness in her voice, paired with a face that appeared to have just woken up. So adorable that Gu Yiyin couldn\u2019t help but kiss her again. Seeing that she accepted his closeness, Gu Yiyin was happy.\u201cHmm. Shower quickly and then rest.\u201dSu Yunluo nodded and good-naturedly. She took her clothes and went into the bathroom to shower.When Gu Yiyin finished his shower and came out of the bathroom, Su Yunluo was sleeping sweetly.Gu Yiyin turned off the light and then went to bed and lay beside Su Yunluo. As if feeling something, Su Yunluo rolled into his arms and reached out to hug his waist. Gu Yiyin froze for a moment and then hugged her tightly.His laughter sounded in the silence of the night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The cat cage was presented, and inside was an orange kitten.\u201cWow. So cute.\u201dSu Yunluo was adorably charmed by the kitten. She carefully opened the cat cage and held it out.Gu Yiyin spoke softly, \u201cA friend of mine\u2019s female cat just recently gave birth to some kittens. He didn\u2019t need so many cats in his house, so he wanted to share some of them away. I took this one when I saw it and brought it back. Do you like it?\u201d\u201cLove it so much.\u201dSu Yunluo\u2019s eyes were shining brightly.She was already fond of pets like cats. She had thought of proposing to Gu Yiyin to keep a cat, but then she forgot about it.Now that she had seen this kitten, it was no doubt that she was more than happy.The kitten was a bit bigger than her hand. It was lying asleep atop hers. She gently smoothed down its fur.She looked up to ask Gu Yiyin softly, \u201cHow old is this kitten? Is this a male or a female?\u201d\u201cIt came out a little over a month ago, and it\u2019s a male,\u201d replied Gu Yiyin.\u201cShould we feed him when he wakes up later? Did you buy cat food?\u201d Su Yunluo asked.Gu Yiyin was troubled upon hearing her.\u201cI brought him back just now that I forgot to buy him cat food.\u201d\u201cThen after dinner, on the way to the supermarket, let\u2019s go to the pet shop.\u201d Suggested Su Yunluo.The couple headed out after dinner. When they arrived at the pet store to buy cat food, they also purchased various cat items such as mats, bowls, shelter, cleaning supplies, and toys.The two left the pet shop and drove to a nearby supermarket to buy daily necessities. Together, they pushed a cart and chatted as they walked.\u201cShampoo, shower gel, paper towels .\u201dSu Yunluo took a shopping list and crossed off one item for each one she took. Once everything was bought, the two went to check out.Su Yunluo took a few more glances when they passed by the snack section. Gu Yiyin saw that she looked like she wanted to buy but was a little hesitant.Amused, he spoke, \u201cGo ahead and pick out what you want to eat.\u201dSu Yunluo cheered and went to pick out snacks, \u201cChips, chocolate, cookies, jelly.\u201dUnconsciously she took a whole bunch that Su Yunluo felt a little embarrassed.\u201cWill it be too much? I\u2019ll put some back.\u201dGu Yiyin dotingly looked at her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m still here, right? I\u2019ll see to it that you don\u2019t overeat.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They had finished paying the bill and were leaving with their things when a cold voice came behind them.\u201cLuoluo.\u201dShe froze, then turned around and spoke, \u201cBrother, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here on business.\u201d Su Yunting walked towards them.\u201cIs this your boyfriend?\u201dShe looked at Gu Yiyin. \u201cOh yes, this is my boyfriend, Gu Yiyin.\u201d Su Yunluo began to introduce Su Yunting.She then turned to look at Gu Yiyin. \u201cYiyin, this is my brother, Su Yunting.\u201d\u201cHi, I\u2019m Gu Yiyin, Luoluo\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d Gu Yiyin smiled and extended his hand.Su Yunting extended his hand back to shake, \u201cI\u2019m Su Yunting.\u201d His voice was cold.\u201cI wonder if Mr. Su is free? Let\u2019s go get a cup of coffee together.\u201d Gu Yiyin proposed.Su Yunting nodded.A particular coffee shop.Sitting across from Su Yunluo and Gu Yiyin, Su Yunting sipped his coffee.\u201cWhere is Mr. Gu successful?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t talk about my work at a high level, but I started a construction company with some friends.\u201d Gu Yiyin smiled.Su Yunting pondered for a moment. \u201cIs it Yiyang Construction?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201dGu Yiyin smiled slightly. Initially, Gu Yiyin founded this company with a few friends, and the company took its name from them. He and one of his friends funded the most and thus held the most shares.Su Yunting nodded approvingly.\u201cGreat company. It is already ranked in the top five in the industry. Mr. Gu is truly a talented young man. You have a good eye.\u201dSu Yunting faintly looked at Su Yunluo. She pursed her lips and did not speak anymore.Objectively speaking, Su Yunting was a very successful man. He graduated from an elite school, worked for Shengguang Group, and sat in the position of General Manager in just a few years.Men who were handsome and capable were in high demand everywhere they went. Many famous ladies were interested in Su Yunting, including the daughter of Shengguang Group.The CEO of Shengguang Group was called Yang Mulin, and he only had one daughter, Yang Peishan.Yang Peishan\u2019s mother passed away early, plus she wasn\u2019t in good health since she was young. Therefore Yang Mulin pampered her and gave her whatever she wanted.In recent years, Yang Mulin began to look for a suitable successor as he aged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once he retired to his old age, no one would take over the business. Yang Peishan would be easy to use by people who wanted to take advantage of her simple nature.Due to various considerations, Yang Mulin searched for a suitable successor, and Su Yunting was the best candidate. Su Yunting had a strong ability and was the one that Yang Peishan liked. If he was chosen as the successor, Shengguang Group would definitely go to the next level, and his daughter would be well fed and clothed for the rest of her life. Therefore, Yang Mulin had already trained Su Yunting in the direction of a successor.They chatted for a while, and Su Yunting left first, saying he had something to do.In the car, perhaps affected by the lingering consciousness of the original owner, Su Yunluo looked very emotionally drained. \u201cLuoluo, you and your brother\u2019s relationship\u2026?\u201d Gu Yiyin asked her cautiously.The situation just now was obvious to see. Su Yunluo and Su Yunting\u2019s relationship was really cold. It was not like brother and sister, but more like ordinary friends or perhaps not even ordinary friends.Su Yunluo tugged out a smile, \u201cMy brother grew up like that. He is so indifferent to everything, me, and even my parents. He is cold and distant as if we are not a family. At first, I thought it was because he could not express it, but now I think he is probably such an emotionless person.\u201dSu Yunluo sighed. The original owner really wanted to get along well with her brother. Still, some people were really only destined to be familiar strangers.Gu Yiyin didn\u2019t know how to comfort her but could only grab her hand and show her that he would be by her side no matter what.Today, Su Yunluo\u2019s company department had a dinner party. An entire team went to eat hot pot and then moved to KTV.Inside the luxury room of KTV, the head of the department was singing, and a group of men was applauding him below. When he was happy, he sang several songs one after another.\u201cSinging all those old songs, no wonder they call him Old Fogey,\u201d a woman sitting next to Su Yunluo rolled her eyes.The head of Su Yunluo\u2019s department was a middle-aged man in his forties. He treated his subordinates well, but he had too many rules and was not adaptable, so he was privately nicknamed \u201cOld Fogey.\u201dSu Yunluo looked at her amusingly, \u201cOkay, you keep your voice down. If he hears you, you\u2019ll have to bear it.\u201d The woman spat out her tongue.At this time, Su Yunluo\u2019s cell phone rang, and she stood up and went outside to answer the phone.\u201cYiyin,\u201d Su Yunluo shouted.\u201cLuoluo, where are you?\u201d Gu Yiyin\u2019s voice sounded muffled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

By the time she got to the back, the wine was on her head, making her dizzy. She leaned her back against the sofa to rest.\u201cLuoluo, are you okay?\u201d A female colleague looked at her worriedly.Su Yunluo shook her head, \u201cFine, just a little dizzy.\u201d\u201cHow about I get you a car and send you back first?\u201d The female colleague spoke.Su Yunluo smiled, \u201cNo, thank you. My boyfriend will come to pick me up later.\u201d Her colleague smiled, nodded, and seated aside to watch her.Not long after, the door was pushed open. A tall man dressed casually came in, none other than Gu Yiyin.The crowd looked at him suspiciously. Among them, a man spoke up and asked him, \u201cThis gentleman, may I ask who you are here to see?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to find Su Yunluo,\u201d he said as his eyes searched the room.At this time, he saw Su Yunluo with her eyes closed in the corner. He walked over with big steps, \u201cLuoluo? Luoluo? Wake up.\u201dSu Yunluo dazedly opened her eyes and saw Gu Yiyin in front of her. She smiled stupidly at him, \u201cYiyin.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me. How come you\u2019re so drunk?\u201d Gu Yiyin was helpless and upset.\u201cI drank a few shots to not get drunk.\u201d Su Yunluo muttered.At this time, the female colleague sitting next to Su Yunluo spoke up, \u201cThis gentleman, you are Luoluo\u2019s boyfriend, right? She\u2019s a bit drunk, so I\u2019ll trouble you to take her back.\u201d\u201cThanks for taking care of her. I\u2019ll take her back.\u201d Gu Yiyin thanked the female colleague and then patted Su Yunluo. \u201cLuoluo, be good. Wake up, I\u2019ll take you back.\u201dSu Yunluo was so drunk that she was too lazy to move and reached out to Gu Yiyin, \u201cYou hold me.\u201d Gu Yiyin smiled dotingly, picked up Su Yunluo, and after talking to the people in the room, he carried her away.Driving home, he passed by a pharmacy to buy a box of sobering pills.Gu Yiyin gently put Su Yunluo on the bed when he arrived home. He then poured a cup of warm water and gave her the sober medicine, \u201cLuoluo, be good and drink the medicine. You will not feel so bad.\u201d Su Yunluo cooperated and obediently opened her mouth to swallow the medicine.After a while, she opened her eyes, \u201cSo hot, I want to take a shower.\u201d She said and was about to get up from the bed.Gu Yiyin hurriedly held her up, \u201cCan you?\u201dSu Yunluo nodded and then walked into the bathroom. After taking a shower, Su Yunluo realized she hadn\u2019t brought any clothes in. She grabbed a large bath towel from the side, wrapped it around her body, and went out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gu Yiyin saw this and shook his head helplessly. When he came out of the bathroom, the drunk was already asleep, and her face was still flushed.Gu Yiyin got into bed and leaned down to give her a kiss on the lips. Who knew that the person who should have been sleeping suddenly opened her eyes. \u201cLuoluo, you\u2019re awake?\u201d Gu Yiyin moved away from her lips.Su Yunluo pushed him away with one hand and complained, \u201cYou stole a kiss from me.\u201dGu Yiyin froze for a moment. How could it still be like this when he had already given her the medicine to sober up?\u201cNo, I also want to kiss back.\u201d After saying that, Su Yunluo cupped his face and kissed him.Only when his thin lips were repeatedly \u201cravaged\u201d that Gu Yiyin react. He never expected a drunk Su Yunluo to be so passionate.She was only wearing a bath towel, but she unconsciously moved around in his arms. Gu Yiyin couldn\u2019t help himself and pressed her underneath him. His thin lips wrapped around her red lips and sucked hard. When she opened her mouth because she couldn\u2019t breathe well, his long and flexible tongue dug into her mouth and stirred, tasting the taste of wine in her mouth.His thin lips moved to a different spot, imprinting several red hickeys on her neck. Yet just as he was about to rip off her bath towel and take the next step, he realized that Su Yunluo was asleep again. Gu Yiyin was helpless. How could this little demon, who had aroused the fire in him, fall asleep like this? He could not do anything to a drunk person.So, Gu Yiyin could only calm down the fire of desire in his body and then hold her tightly to sleep.The drunk Su Yunluo slept very restlessly that night, always wriggling around in his arms. Gu Yiyin had a high desire to take a cold shower all night, but Su Yunluo was firmly on him, so he could not move. There was nothing he could do but hold back and just stay awake until dawn.When Su Yunluo woke up, her body still felt weak the next day. Fortunately, Gu Yiyin had already asked for leave from work for her. She got up from the bed like a wandering soul and went to the bathroom to wash up.Halfway through brushing her teeth, the doorbell rang. Thinking it was Gu Yiyin, Su Yunluo didn\u2019t bother to clean up her image and opened the door with her mouth full of foam and in bare feet.It turned out that the person standing outside the door was not Gu Yiyin, but his mother! Mother Gu was also frozen when she saw her. Both of them just stood at the door and stared at each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then she poured her a glass of water, \u201cAuntie, have a seat for a while. I\u2019ll go clean up myself.\u201d She looked a little embarrassed.\u201cYou go ahead,\u201d Mother Gu nodded.So, Su Yunluo hurriedly washed up in the bathroom. When she looked in the mirror, she realized her neck was covered with \u201cstrawberries\u201d that had been planted by a man. She almost couldn\u2019t help squealing in disbelief. Was Gu Yiyin a dog? Her neck was like this, and she was definitely seen for sure by his mother. She lost a lot of face now.She changed into a high-necked dress and made some mental preparations to get out of the bedroom. Just then, Gu Yiyin also came back.Gu Yiyin was afraid that Su Yunluo would be uncomfortable when she woke up this morning. He returned from a meeting at the company. When his mother called him and said she wanted to come over, Gu Yiyin agreed. But he didn\u2019t expect his mother to be here so soon, which caught Su Yunluo off guard.\u201cMom, you\u2019ve arrived so early?\u201d Gu Yiyin changed his slippers at the entrance and then walked to Su Yunluo. \u201cDid you get enough sleep? Is there any discomfort?\u201d He dotingly stroked her head.\u201cDon\u2019t be like this. Auntie is watching.\u201d In front of Mother Gu, Su Yunluo was a little embarrassed.\u201cMom, this is your future daughter-in-law, Su Yunluo,\u201d Gu Yiyin introduced her to Mother Gu.Mother Gu nodded, \u201cFinally, I\u2019ve met you. What a good child.\u201d Mother Gu had a loving expression as she looked at Su Yunluo.They sat down on the sofa in the living room. Su Yunluo was a bit formal when she faced Mother Gu, but Mother Gu was always very kind. This helped Su Yunluo to relax and chat pleasantly with Mother Gu.After communicating for a while, Mother Gu was even more satisfied with Su Yunluo. She had clear eyes and a generous demeanor. Also, looking at her son, he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off the girl. She was shy, but her eyes were full of happiness.

Unexpectedly, she came to see her son\u2019s girlfriend this time. A long time ago, Gu Yiyin said he had a girlfriend, but there had been no opportunity to meet her. Now that she had seen the girl, she was a perfect kid. She looked a little thin, so she had to be given a good supplement.Thinking of this, Mother Gu showed a smile, \u201cCome, Luoluo. Auntie boiled this soup. You drink it.\u201d She unscrewed the thermos lid, and immediately the rich fragrance of soup wafted out.\u201cThis,\u201d Su Yunluo hesitated a little. This soup was made for Gu Yiyin. Would it be too good for her to drink?Seeing that she was a bit hesitant, Mother Gu then spoke, \u201cLuoluo, drink it while it\u2019s warm, or it will get cold. Moreover, you look so thin, you need to make up for it.\u201d\u201cYou can drink it. Don\u2019t waste mom\u2019s good intentions.\u201d Gu Yiyin smiled at the side.So, Su Yunluo took small sips of the soup. When she finished drinking, Mother Gu asked her gently, \u201cIs Auntie\u2019s cooking okay?\u201d\u201cMmm, Auntie\u2019s cooking is delicious. Thank you, Auntie,\u201d Su Yunluo blushed a little.\u201cGood that you like it. Auntie will make more soups for you to drink in the future to ensure that you will be fat and white.\u201d Mother Gu looked at her lovingly.After sitting for a while, Mother Gu excused herself and left. It was then that Su Yunluo let out a sigh of relief, and mother Gu seemed to like her very much.Right then, Gu Yiyin wrapped his arm around her waist from behind and rested his head on her shoulder, \u201cMy mom likes you a lot.\u201dSu Yunluo turned around to face him, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that Auntie was coming over?

You do not even know how bad my face was when I opened the door to your mother this morning. Also, who told you to nibble my neck like this? Your mother must have seen them, and how embarrassing.\u201d Speaking of which, Su Yunluo looked grudgingly at him.Gu Yiyin chuckled lightly, \u201cOkay, okay, it\u2019s all my fault.

He picked it up and saw it, then wore a gentle smile, \u201cHello? Luloluo.\u201d\u201cYiyin, where are you?\u201d Su Yunluo\u2019s voice sounded incredibly soft.\u201cI\u2019m at the company. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Gu Yiyin spoke patiently.\u201cThen hurry home. I have a surprise for you,\u201d Su Yunluo spoke mysteriously.Gu Yiyin inquired about that when Su Yunluo ended the call. Gu Yiyin smiled helplessly. He packed up his things and left the office.When he returned home filled with anticipation, the dim light illuminated the quiet apartment.Then his gaze was drawn to the large box in the living room: was this the surprise that Luoluo had mentioned?He opened the box. Then Su Yunlou appeared. She was supposed to be at her best friend\u2019s wedding ceremony. She smiled at him, \u201cHappy Qixi Festival!\u201d Did I surprise you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I learned it from a very famous cake maker,\u201d she pulled his hand along and sat down in front of the coffee table.It was a heart-shaped cake with a man and a woman snuggling up to each other, which was Su Yunluo and Gu Yiyin.Gu Yiyin took a bite of the cake. The smooth cream quickly melted in his mouth, and it was sweet but not greasy and was very delicious.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d Su Yunluo looked at him expectantly, resembling a kid waiting for praise.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious,\u201d Gu Yiyin smiled dotingly.\u201cWell, do I have any reward?\u201d Su Yunluo looked at him with a grin.Gu Yiyin had taken out a square box from his pocket, then he opened it, which contained a ring lying inside.Gu Yiyin slowly put it on Su Yunluo\u2019s ring finger, \u201cThis is a couple\u2019s ring that I had someone custom-made. When we get married in the future, I\u2019ll give you a bigger one.\u201dSu Yunluo lovingly touched the ring, \u201cSo beautiful. I like it very much.\u201d Then, she felt distressed, \u201cBut I don\u2019t even have a gift for you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need a gift if I have you,\u201d Gu Yiyin spoke gently.Su Yunluo shook her head, \u201cNo. I want to give you a gift. I know. I\u2019ll give you myself .\u201dGu Yiyin didn\u2019t dare to believe it, and he almost thought he heard wrong. In front of him, he looked at the smiling woman and had some difficulty speaking, \u201cLuoluo, do you know what you are saying?\u201d\u201cI know! I said. I ~ will ~ give ~ myself ~ to ~ you!\u201d She leaned closer to him, speaking slowly and clearly, word by word.By the time he regained his senses, warm contact was on his lips. His beloved girl was kissing him. Gu Yiyin reached to embrace her tightly into his arms and held her red lips in his mouth.The girl\u2019s lips tasted delicious and soft, making him lick and kiss repeatedly with desire. Su Yunluo slightly opened her mouth, and Gu Yiyin\u2019s long tongue used the opportunity to get in. She had the taste of strawberry cake, but he couldn\u2019t tell whether the cake was sweet or she was sweeter.They moved with emotion as the tension in the air rose with each passing breath. Gu Yiyin gently picked her up horizontally and took a big step towards the bedroom. The two people\u2019s lips and tongues remained deeply intertwined and did not separate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The man\u2019s robust body covered her, and the burning warmth came overwhelmingly. Gu Yiyin took her red lips and eagerly sucked and kissed them. His hands were messily tugging at their clothes: suit jackets, ties, shirts, pants. Su Yunluo cooperated by raising her arms and letting him smoothly take off her clothes.Gu Yiyin\u2019s upper body was naked, and his lower body only had a pair of underwear covering his burgeoning desire. He held Su Yunluo and stripped down to her bra and lace panties.Su Yunluo\u2019s skin was soft and smooth and felt as good as the finest jade, so Gu Yiyin caressed it with love. A tingling sensation flooded the area touched by the man\u2019s large palm, and Su Yunluo\u2019s body couldn\u2019t help but tremble slightly.The man\u2019s flexible long tongue curled around the woman\u2019s soft tongue and sucked it, greedily devouring the sweet juices between the woman\u2019s lips and teeth. The woman let out a small moan, her white arms wrapped around the man\u2019s neck, her soft, boneless body clinging tightly to the man\u2019s, unable to be separated.The temperature inside was hot. After an unknown time, the man finally let go of the woman\u2019s lips that had been kissed red and swollen. Gu Yiyin looked at the woman beneath him, his gaze with indescribable fire: he saw Su Yunluo\u2019s face like a flower, her eyes carrying the trace of charm, her red lips were delicate and covered with a layer of glistening moisture, and her perfectly formed mounds wrapped in a black bra that rose and fell with her breathing, tempting the man\u2019s eyes.Gu Yiyin\u2019s hand explored the woman\u2019s back, fumbling to find the secret lock. \u201cSnap,\u201d the secret lock was unlocked, and the satiating mounds broke free from the bra\u2019s restraints and popped out.The snow-white breasts, dotted with a pink cherry on top, were exposed to the cool air and trembled slightly as if frightened. Gu Yiyin\u2019s hand shivered as his palm touched the woman\u2019s smoothness and bounciness, which the man kneaded and squeezed with his own knowledge.\u201cMmmmmm. So comfortable.\u201d The woman squinted her teary eyes and moaned softly. Her breasts were sent upward into the man\u2019s hands, wordlessly demanding heavier play from the man.The soft breasts changed into various shapes in the man\u2019s hands. The man\u2019s fingertips scraped over the tip of the breast from time to time, making them hard and erect. Gu Yiyin lowered his head and fascinatingly breathed in milk\u2019s faint scent from the soft bosom. He reached his tongue out and tentatively licked the woman\u2019s nipples. The woman seemed delighted; her body wriggled and issued an invitation.Gu Yiyin was encouraged and impolitely seized a nipple. His tongue slid around the tip of the nipple and licked it back and forth, biting and sucking heavily from time to time. Su Yunluo was so comfortable being licked by the man that her hands couldn\u2019t help but hold his head buried in her chest and press him towards herself. Her mouth kept panting with impatience.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her thin lace bottom had been soaked with love juices, and the moist fabric clung to her tender flower, making her rub it lightly with difficulty.The man\u2019s mouth kept moving, and his hands didn\u2019t stay on the sidelines. A big thick palm went down along the woman\u2019s waistline and touched the woman\u2019s inner thighs. The man\u2019s fingers went around the most tender piece and caressed it slightly ambiguously. When the woman was teased, the man\u2019s fingers hooked the edge of the panties. He gradually pulled them down, revealing the soft, forbidden area between the woman\u2019s legs.The big palm covered and gently stroked, and he soon felt the slippery fluid all over his palm. The man\u2019s finger explored the woman\u2019s garden. When he touched a bulging pearl and pressed it, he heard the woman let out an \u201cahh\u201d sound, and then the juices flowed even faster. So, his fingers circled around that spot, sliding up and down against the point and rubbing it. Sometimes he would reach out two fingers to hold it and gently pull it out.\u201cMmm ah. Ah.\u201d when the sensitive point was stimulated, Su Yunluo wriggled her slim waist. She kept panting with her red lips, one more charming than the other. Her lower body was like losing the inhibition, continuously flowing the burst of love fluid. The bedsheet underneath is drenched with large ambiguous watermarks.\u201cMmmmm. Aha.\u201d Su Yunluo opened her legs wide and panted urgently. Both her upper and lower sensitivities were fiercely played with by the man. Gu Yiyin used his hands and mouth, using all kinds of tactics to tease her and provoke her so that she could only moan and squirm helplessly under him.After Gu Yiyin squeezed the bulging pearl once again, Su Yunluo finally couldn\u2019t help but let out a scream. Her legs spread wide helplessly, and she released a large stream of water, climaxing under the man\u2019s hand.Gu Yiyin took his mouth out of the red-colored nipple. He kissed her hard on her luscious lips, then stood up straight and took off the last layer of coverings on his body, revealing the long-standing hard desire between his legs. The stick was thick and long, with veins twisting around its body and a few drops of viscous fluid spilling out of the small hole at the very front, which twitched slightly to show the man\u2019s impatience.Gu Yiyin took a handful of the woman\u2019s fluid between her legs and applied it to his stick. He pressed his tall body towards the woman again, with his burgeoning giant between his legs against the woman\u2019s sensitive core. He spoke deeply and said, \u201cLuo Luo, I\u2019m coming in.\u201d After that, his rod squeezed open the two pink flower lips and pushed towards the warm and tight hole.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She heard the man whisper in her ear, and a tearing pain immediately came from her lower body.\u201cIt hurts.\u201d Su Yunluo wrinkled her pretty eyebrows. The corners of her eyes could not help but shed a string of teardrops.Gu Yiyin did not dare to move. He leaned down and kissed Su Yunluo\u2019s tears away. His thin lips licked her red lips gently, and his warm palm held her softness, kneading and caressing them.When the woman\u2019s brow was loosened, Gu Yiyin lifted her thighs to wrap around his waist. He moved hard his waist and abdomen, one after another, towering.\u201cMmmm ah. Ah ha. So much. \u201d Su Yunluo gradually got the fun. Her red lips overflowed with sweet moans.The man\u2019s movements gradually increased, holding the woman\u2019s soft waist and thrusting wildly in and out. The sound of flesh slapping \u201cpop, pop, pop \u201d sounded constantly. Love juice mixed with wisps of virgin blood from the intersection of the two were squeezed out, dripping on the bed sheet rendering a smear of red.The woman\u2019s p*ssy was warm and tight, and when the rod was inserted, the flesh swarmed up from all sides to wrap it tightly. When it was withdrawn, it firmly clung to it and did not let it go.The sweat on Gu Yiyin\u2019s head came down in drops, falling along his rigid jaw line into the woman\u2019s snow-white breasts. The woman underneath him was deeply loved by his waist and abs, nine shallow and one deep. The thick, long meat stick was moistened with love juices and glistened with water, weaving back and forth between the narrow slit of the flower.\u201cMmmmmm. So deep. So heavy. Yiyin. \u201d Su Yunluo babbled and breathed out a confusing moan. The narrow flower path was stretched open again and again by the thick and long thing. The huge tip deeply jacked the tender flower center, which contracted tighter and tighter as it was stimulated.Gu Yiyin\u2019s burning eyes looked at the woman beneath him: He saw her charming body, such as seaweed-like long hair scattered on the pillow, delicate face with a strong expression of spring, the small red lips spitting moans, the snow-white breasts trembling slightly, and the delicate hole gulping his own male symbol, a living siren.This lascivious appearance made Gu Yiyin turn into a wolf. With red eyes, his waist and abdomen pounded furiously, eager to break her.He tightly wrapped his arms around the woman beneath him, and his c*ck was deeply rooted in her p*ssy. When he pulled out, only the large glans were left at the opening, then plunged in again, and so on.The sweet love juice from the two of them splashed out. The lower part of their belly was stained with a wet, love juice at the man\u2019s high speed in and out movements. It turned into white foam and stuck to the woman\u2019s p*ssy, and it was incredibly lascivious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The slippery flesh was tightly strangling the thick rod, like a small suction cup firmly holding on to it.However, the man did not have enough. He lifted the woman\u2019s legs, put them in his arm\u2019s crook, and leaned down to thrust them harder. \u201cMmmm. Baby. Open your eyes to see how I love you.\u201dSu Yunluo bowed her head slightly and saw the thick and hideous crimson flesh rod. It went in and out of her red flower hole with high intensity. The two pink flower lips were rubbed red, swollen, and engorged with blood. The taut round hole was like a greedy mouth greedily devouring the man\u2019s rod, and the love juices dripped outward without stopping.Watching this lascivious scene, the woman\u2019s body became more sensitive and emotional. Her p*ssy bit the man\u2019s rod so tight that the soft flesh stacked up to bind the thick meat stick inch by inch. She pulled it inward with force, bringing the man the ultimate experience.The two snow-white breasts swung along with the man\u2019s frenzied thrusting to make attractive waves. The man\u2019s eyes and hands were itching to grab the two balls and knead them slightly roughly. The white breast flesh spilled out from the man\u2019s fingers, and the two nipples were bright red like blood at the top.\u201cOoooo. Mmm ah. Yiyin. Ah ha. Mmm. \u201d Su Yunluo moaned unconsciously. All her senses were focused on the two people\u2019s tightly united lower bodies. The pleasure inside her body was so raging that Su Yunluo felt as if she was in heaven, drifting and not knowing what to do.The man f*cked the woman\u2019s p*ssy so hard that he wanted to stuff his two balls into it. The original pink p*ssy turned a bright red as the man thrust in and out. The two lips on the side of the hole flopped in and out as the man bangs her, clinging pathetically to the sinewy meat stick.The woman\u2019s p*ssy began to contract violently. The walls of the p*ssy squirmed and squeezed the man\u2019s rod, and Gu Yiyin knew she would come. The speed of the collisions of the lower body increased by a few points.On the verge of coming, Gu Yiyin sealed her red lips that exhaled a tempting moan. He buried his lower body deep into the woman\u2019s p*ssy, reaching the peak at the same time as she did.Su Yunluo arched her body. A great deal of thick white turbidity gushed into her flower. The burning sensation caused Su Yunluo\u2019s p*ssy to spurt out another stream of watery fluid uncontrollably, and her flat belly was filled with the body fluids of both of them.\u201cLuo Luo. I love you.\u201d Gu Yiyin gasped, whispering in the woman\u2019s ear.Su Yunluo was too tired and did not hear what the man said. She closed her eyes and slept after finding a comfortable position in the man\u2019s arms. The man beside her was still gleaming, kissing the woman in his arms with love and affection, feeling incomparably happy at this moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she looked in the mirror, she realized her neck was covered with \u201cstrawberries\u201d that had been planted by a man. She almost couldn\u2019t help squealing in disbelief. Was Gu Yiyin a dog? Her neck was like this, and she was definitely seen for sure by his mother. She lost a lot of face now.She changed into a high-necked dress and made some mental preparations to get out of the bedroom. Just then, Gu Yiyin also came back.Gu Yiyin was afraid that Su Yunluo would be uncomfortable when she woke up this morning. He returned from a meeting at the company. When his mother called him and said she wanted to come over, Gu Yiyin agreed.

Auntie boiled this soup. You drink it.\u201d She unscrewed the thermos lid, and immediately the rich fragrance of soup wafted out.\u201cThis,\u201d Su Yunluo hesitated a little.

I\u2019ll give you myself .\u201dGu Yiyin didn\u2019t dare to believe it, and he almost thought he heard wrong. In front of him, he looked at the smiling woman and had some difficulty speaking, \u201cLuoluo, do you know what you are saying?\u201d\u201cI know! I said. I ~ will ~ give ~ myself ~ to ~ you!\u201d She leaned closer to him, speaking slowly and clearly, word by word.By the time he regained his senses, warm contact was on his lips. His beloved girl was kissing him. Gu Yiyin reached to embrace her tightly into his arms and held her red lips in his mouth.The girl\u2019s lips tasted delicious and soft, making him lick and kiss repeatedly with desire. Su Yunluo slightly opened her mouth, and Gu Yiyin\u2019s long tongue used the opportunity to get in. She had the taste of strawberry cake, but he couldn\u2019t tell whether the cake was sweet or she was sweeter.They moved with emotion as the tension in the air rose with each passing breath. Gu Yiyin gently picked her up horizontally and took a big step towards the bedroom. The two people\u2019s lips and tongues remained deeply intertwined and did not separate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The man\u2019s robust body covered her, and the burning warmth came overwhelmingly. Gu Yiyin took her red lips and eagerly sucked and kissed them. His hands were messily tugging at their clothes: suit jackets, ties, shirts, pants. Su Yunluo cooperated by raising her arms and letting him smoothly take off her clothes.Gu Yiyin\u2019s upper body was naked, and his lower body only had a pair of underwear covering his burgeoning desire. He held Su Yunluo and stripped down to her bra and lace panties.Su Yunluo\u2019s skin was soft and smooth and felt as good as the finest jade, so Gu Yiyin caressed it with love. A tingling sensation flooded the area touched by the man\u2019s large palm, and Su Yunluo\u2019s body couldn\u2019t help but tremble slightly.The man\u2019s flexible long tongue curled around the woman\u2019s soft tongue and sucked it, greedily devouring the sweet juices between the woman\u2019s lips and teeth. The woman let out a small moan, her white arms wrapped around the man\u2019s neck, her soft, boneless body clinging tightly to the man\u2019s, unable to be separated.The temperature inside was hot. After an unknown time, the man finally let go of the woman\u2019s lips that had been kissed red and swollen. Gu Yiyin looked at the woman beneath him, his gaze with indescribable fire: he saw Su Yunluo\u2019s face like a flower, her eyes carrying the trace of charm, her red lips were delicate and covered with a layer of glistening moisture, and her perfectly formed mounds wrapped in a black bra that rose and fell with her breathing, tempting the man\u2019s eyes.Gu Yiyin\u2019s hand explored the woman\u2019s back, fumbling to find the secret lock. \u201cSnap,\u201d the secret lock was unlocked, and the satiating mounds broke free from the bra\u2019s restraints and popped out.The snow-white breasts, dotted with a pink cherry on top, were exposed to the cool air and trembled slightly as if frightened. Gu Yiyin\u2019s hand shivered as his palm touched the woman\u2019s smoothness and bounciness, which the man kneaded and squeezed with his own knowledge.\u201cMmmmmm. So comfortable.\u201d The woman squinted her teary eyes and moaned softly. Her breasts were sent upward into the man\u2019s hands, wordlessly demanding heavier play from the man.The soft breasts changed into various shapes in the man\u2019s hands. The man\u2019s fingertips scraped over the tip of the breast from time to time, making them hard and erect. Gu Yiyin lowered his head and fascinatingly breathed in milk\u2019s faint scent from the soft bosom. He reached his tongue out and tentatively licked the woman\u2019s nipples. The woman seemed delighted; her body wriggled and issued an invitation.Gu Yiyin was encouraged and impolitely seized a nipple. His tongue slid around the tip of the nipple and licked it back and forth, biting and sucking heavily from time to time. Su Yunluo was so comfortable being licked by the man that her hands couldn\u2019t help but hold his head buried in her chest and press him towards herself. Her mouth kept panting with impatience.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her thin lace bottom had been soaked with love juices, and the moist fabric clung to her tender flower, making her rub it lightly with difficulty.The man\u2019s mouth kept moving, and his hands didn\u2019t stay on the sidelines. A big thick palm went down along the woman\u2019s waistline and touched the woman\u2019s inner thighs. The man\u2019s fingers went around the most tender piece and caressed it slightly ambiguously. When the woman was teased, the man\u2019s fingers hooked the edge of the panties. He gradually pulled them down, revealing the soft, forbidden area between the woman\u2019s legs.The big palm covered and gently stroked, and he soon felt the slippery fluid all over his palm. The man\u2019s finger explored the woman\u2019s garden. When he touched a bulging pearl and pressed it, he heard the woman let out an \u201cahh\u201d sound, and then the juices flowed even faster. So, his fingers circled around that spot, sliding up and down against the point and rubbing it. Sometimes he would reach out two fingers to hold it and gently pull it out.\u201cMmm ah. Ah.\u201d when the sensitive point was stimulated, Su Yunluo wriggled her slim waist. She kept panting with her red lips, one more charming than the other. Her lower body was like losing the inhibition, continuously flowing the burst of love fluid. The bedsheet underneath is drenched with large ambiguous watermarks.\u201cMmmmm. Aha.\u201d Su Yunluo opened her legs wide and panted urgently. Both her upper and lower sensitivities were fiercely played with by the man. Gu Yiyin used his hands and mouth, using all kinds of tactics to tease her and provoke her so that she could only moan and squirm helplessly under him.After Gu Yiyin squeezed the bulging pearl once again, Su Yunluo finally couldn\u2019t help but let out a scream. Her legs spread wide helplessly, and she released a large stream of water, climaxing under the man\u2019s hand.Gu Yiyin took his mouth out of the red-colored nipple. He kissed her hard on her luscious lips, then stood up straight and took off the last layer of coverings on his body, revealing the long-standing hard desire between his legs. The stick was thick and long, with veins twisting around its body and a few drops of viscous fluid spilling out of the small hole at the very front, which twitched slightly to show the man\u2019s impatience.Gu Yiyin took a handful of the woman\u2019s fluid between her legs and applied it to his stick. He pressed his tall body towards the woman again, with his burgeoning giant between his legs against the woman\u2019s sensitive core. He spoke deeply and said, \u201cLuo Luo, I\u2019m coming in.\u201d After that, his rod squeezed open the two pink flower lips and pushed towards the warm and tight hole.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She heard the man whisper in her ear, and a tearing pain immediately came from her lower body.\u201cIt hurts.\u201d Su Yunluo wrinkled her pretty eyebrows. The corners of her eyes could not help but shed a string of teardrops.Gu Yiyin did not dare to move. He leaned down and kissed Su Yunluo\u2019s tears away. His thin lips licked her red lips gently, and his warm palm held her softness, kneading and caressing them.When the woman\u2019s brow was loosened, Gu Yiyin lifted her thighs to wrap around his waist. He moved hard his waist and abdomen, one after another, towering.\u201cMmmm ah. Ah ha. So much. \u201d Su Yunluo gradually got the fun. Her red lips overflowed with sweet moans.The man\u2019s movements gradually increased, holding the woman\u2019s soft waist and thrusting wildly in and out. The sound of flesh slapping \u201cpop, pop, pop \u201d sounded constantly. Love juice mixed with wisps of virgin blood from the intersection of the two were squeezed out, dripping on the bed sheet rendering a smear of red.The woman\u2019s p*ssy was warm and tight, and when the rod was inserted, the flesh swarmed up from all sides to wrap it tightly. When it was withdrawn, it firmly clung to it and did not let it go.The sweat on Gu Yiyin\u2019s head came down in drops, falling along his rigid jaw line into the woman\u2019s snow-white breasts. The woman underneath him was deeply loved by his waist and abs, nine shallow and one deep. The thick, long meat stick was moistened with love juices and glistened with water, weaving back and forth between the narrow slit of the flower.\u201cMmmmmm.\u00a0 So deep. So heavy.\u00a0 Yiyin. \u201d Su Yunluo babbled and breathed out a confusing moan. The narrow flower path was stretched open again and again by the thick and long thing. The huge tip deeply jacked the tender flower center, which contracted tighter and tighter as it was stimulated.Gu Yiyin\u2019s burning eyes looked at the woman beneath him: He saw her charming body, such as seaweed-like long hair scattered on the pillow, delicate face with a strong expression of spring, the small red lips spitting moans, the snow-white breasts trembling slightly, and the delicate hole gulping his own male symbol, a living siren.This lascivious appearance made Gu Yiyin turn into a wolf. With red eyes, his waist and abdomen pounded furiously, eager to break her.He tightly wrapped his arms around the woman beneath him, and his c*ck was deeply rooted in her p*ssy. When he pulled out, only the large glans were left at the opening, then plunged in again, and so on.The sweet love juice from the two of them splashed out. The lower part of their belly was stained with a wet, love juice at the man\u2019s high speed in and out movements. It turned into white foam and stuck to the woman\u2019s p*ssy, and it was incredibly lascivious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The slippery flesh was tightly strangling the thick rod, like a small suction cup firmly holding on to it.However, the man did not have enough. He lifted the woman\u2019s legs, put them in his arm\u2019s crook, and leaned down to thrust them harder. \u201cMmmm. Baby.\u00a0 Open your eyes to see how I love you.\u201dSu Yunluo bowed her head slightly and saw the thick and hideous crimson flesh rod. It went in and out of her red flower hole with high intensity. The two pink flower lips were rubbed red, swollen, and engorged with blood. The taut round hole was like a greedy mouth greedily devouring the man\u2019s rod, and the love juices dripped outward without stopping.Watching this lascivious scene, the woman\u2019s body became more sensitive and emotional. Her p*ssy bit the man\u2019s rod so tight that the soft flesh stacked up to bind the thick meat stick inch by inch. She pulled it inward with force, bringing the man the ultimate experience.The two snow-white breasts swung along with the man\u2019s frenzied thrusting to make attractive waves. The man\u2019s eyes and hands were itching to grab the two balls and knead them slightly roughly. The white breast flesh spilled out from the man\u2019s fingers, and the two nipples were bright red like blood at the top.\u201cOoooo. Mmm ah.\u00a0 Yiyin. Ah ha.\u00a0 Mmm. \u201d Su Yunluo moaned unconsciously. All her senses were focused on the two people\u2019s tightly united lower bodies. The pleasure inside her body was so raging that Su Yunluo felt as if she was in heaven, drifting and not knowing what to do.The man f*cked the woman\u2019s p*ssy so hard that he wanted to stuff his two balls into it. The original pink p*ssy turned a bright red as the man thrust in and out. The two lips on the side of the hole flopped in and out as the man bangs her, clinging pathetically to the sinewy meat stick.The woman\u2019s p*ssy began to contract violently. The walls of the p*ssy squirmed and squeezed the man\u2019s rod, and Gu Yiyin knew she would come. The speed of the collisions of the lower body increased by a few points.On the verge of coming, Gu Yiyin sealed her red lips that exhaled a tempting moan. He buried his lower body deep into the woman\u2019s p*ssy, reaching the peak at the same time as she did.Su Yunluo arched her body. A great deal of thick white turbidity gushed into her flower. The burning sensation caused Su Yunluo\u2019s p*ssy to spurt out another stream of watery fluid uncontrollably, and her flat belly was filled with the body fluids of both of them.\u201cLuo Luo.\u00a0 I love you.\u201d Gu Yiyin gasped, whispering in the woman\u2019s ear.Su Yunluo was too tired and did not hear what the man said. She closed her eyes and slept after finding a comfortable position in the man\u2019s arms. The man beside her was still gleaming, kissing the woman in his arms with love and affection, feeling incomparably happy at this moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The man looked at the sleeping woman in his arms in the dark blue bed with evident love.Su Yunluo was lying quietly in the crook of his arm, eyes closed, breathing lightly, with a hint of redness on her face. She was obviously in a deep sleep.It was late when it ended last night; Su Yunluo was extremely tired and fell asleep in his arms. Gu Yiyin looked at her sleeping face for a long time before falling asleep. However, early this morning, the powerful biological clock still made him open his eyes at seven o\u2019clock on time.Even though he didn\u2019t sleep much last night, Gu Yiyin was still in good spirits. The only thing was that Su Yunluo was done hard by him last night, and she was still asleep. One of Su Yunluo\u2019s arms was exposed outside the blanket, which was covered with traces of the man\u2019s love. Not to mention the sensitive body was hidden under the blanket.The man looked at her with fascination and felt he could not get enough of her. So a morning passed, and the woman in his arms finally stirred this time.Su Yunluo had woken up when she saw a pair of eyes as deep as the sea. She subconsciously rubbed herself in the man\u2019s arms, \u201cGood morning. Yiyin.\u201d\u201cGood morning. Baby.\u201d Gu Yiyin picked up her hand and placed it on his lips for a kiss.\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Su Yunluo lay under the covers and stretched out.\u201cTwelve o\u2019clock.\u201d Gu Yiyin picked up his phone and glanced at it. \u201cDo you want to go back to sleep?\u201dSu Yunluo shook her head, \u201cNo, I\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s get up and eat,\u201d said she, sitting up from the bed.After getting dressed and standing up at the edge of the bed, Su Yunluo felt her legs trembling and couldn\u2019t help but turn around and glare at Gu Yiyin.Gu Yiyin\u2019s eyes were gentle. Amid Su Yunluo\u2019s cry of surprise, he carried her to the bathroom and then put her down. Su Yunluo drove Gu Yiyin out of the bathroom and closed the door.Su Yunluo took off her clothes and stood in front of the mirror, looking at herself: the original snow-white flawless skin was covered with bruises and purple hickeys, the snow-white breast was covered with men\u2019s fingerprints and hickeys, and the nipples were still a little swollen and felt a slight tingle when touched gently.Looking at her lower body, after a night\u2019s rest basically recovered as before. However, the original tightly closed flower lips were slightly turned out. Also, a sticky liquid flowed out her legs again when she moved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Su Yunluo walked over and hugged his waist from behind. \u201cIt smells so good. What kind of delicious food are you cooking?\u201dGu Yiyin stopped the action in his hands and turned around. He smiled with his eyes, \u201cI\u2019m making your chicken curry.\u201dBefore Gu Yiyin took Su Yunluo to a famous Southeast Asian restaurant, Su Yunluo fell in love with the curry chicken there and never forgot it. To satisfy Su Yunluo\u2019s appetite for food, Gu Yiyin went to learn this dish.Su Yunluo smelled the rich curry fragrance and immediately blossomed, \u201cIt must be delicious.\u201dLooking at Su Yunluo\u2019s gluttonous face, Gu Yiyin pinched her straight nose, \u201cGo and sit down. You can eat soon .\u201dWhen the last dish was finished frying, Gu Yiyin turned off the fire and put the dish on the table. Three simple dishes and a soup with white rice were enough.Su Yunluo was hungry and took a big bite of rice with the chicken curry. Gu Yiyin smiled at her and kept putting vegetables in her bowl. The two of them chatted, and the atmosphere was warm.After lunch, the two were intimately nestled on the sofa watching a movie when Su Yunluo suddenly spoke up, \u201cYiyin, do you have any plans for the National Day holiday?\u201d\u201cNo, why? Is Luo Luo thinking of going somewhere to play?\u201d Gu Yiyin rubbed her hair.\u201cThen you come back with me to meet mom and dad.\u201d The two of them were getting better and better these days. Su Yunluo remembered that Gu Yiyin hadn\u2019t met her parents yet, so she took advantage of the National Day holiday to bring him home.Gu Yiyin was surprised, then happy, \u201cThen what do uncle and aunt like? I\u2019ll go prepare.\u201d\u201cMy parents do not have special favorite things. See to it that you prepared something, as long as the intention is there .\u201d Su Yunluo spoke.\u201cSo? Then let me think about it,\u201d Gu Yiyin was slightly distressed. Su Yunluo looked at his distressed face, smiling at the side.The day passed quietly, and soon it was night. Although Gu Yiyin wanted Su Yunluo very much, she experienced her first love affair last night, so it was not good to enjoy her again. The two hugged and kissed for a while, then embraced each other and went to sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My parents are very nice .\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Gu Yiyin took a deep breath and slowly spoke.Su Yunluo looked at him with amusement: This man tossed and turned last night and fell asleep very late, and he did not sleep for a few hours before getting up to prepare.Looking at his large bags of gifts, Su Yunluo\u2019s heart warmed.The elevator stopped at that floor. The elevator door opened, and the two stepped out and stopped at the apartment entrance diagonally opposite. Su Yunluo took out the key to open the door. At this time, the door of the apartment next door opened, and a middle-aged woman came out. \u201cYunluo is back,\u201d the middle-aged woman greeted with a smile.\u201cLong time no see, Auntie Li .\u201d Su Yunluo greeted her with a smile. As Su Yunluo called her, Auntie Li was an old resident and had moved here a year earlier than Su Yunluo\u2019s family. She was kind and had a good relationship with Su Yunluo\u2019s family.\u201cIs this your boyfriend?\u201d Auntie Li looked at Gu Yiyin curiously.\u201cYes, I took advantage of the holiday to bring him back to meet my parents.\u201d Su Yunluo slowly spoke.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.

It was not easy to have a short vacation, and Yang Peishan naturally would not let go of this opportunity to cultivate feelings with him. She sought the help of Father Yang. Under pressure from Father Yang, Su Yunting agreed. Yang Peishan planned to take advantage of this time to please Father, Mother Su, and Su Yunluo.Su Yunting returned with his friend, so his mother went to the kitchen and stir-fried two more dishes. Yang Peishan wanted to help, but she was a guest, and mother Su couldn\u2019t let her do it; Yang Peishan\u2019s cooking skills were not good, so she just paid lip service.At the dinner table, several people were talking and laughing. Yang Peishan was very good at keeping the mood, properly throwing out topics without making people unable to answer. So after the meal, Yang Peishan got a lot of good impressions from Father Su and Mother Su. Su Yunluo did not treat her warmly, which made Yang Peishan feel helpless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some say that 500 glances back in a previous life were exchanged for a brush with this one\u2026 I wonder if I have this honor to get you to stop and stay? At the end of the letter, the closing was written by Sui Qingfeng.Sui Qingfeng. Gu Yiyin pondered before remembering that he had given him the \u201cexcellent graduate\u201d trophy on the day of the award. When he thought that he had not only given his rival a position but also witnessed the growth of Su Yunluo\u2019s university, Gu Yiyin was a little less than happy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His face didn\u2019t look very good, so she walked over to him, confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dGu Yiyin did not answer her. Su Yunluo took the letter in his hand and looked at it. She looked a little embarrassed: Oh no, I let him read the love letter someone else wrote to me.Su Yunluo cautiously spoke, \u201cYiyin, are you angry?\u201d Seeing Gu Yiyin hesitant to speak, Su Yunluo was anxious and explained, \u201cYiyin, things are not what you think. I did not even know that the president liked me at first. And when he gave me this letter, he did not say anything. I thought it was just an ordinary letter and did not open it to see it. \u201c\u201cLuo Luo, I\u2019m not angry.\u201d Gu Yiyin spoke quietly, \u201cI\u2019m just jealous.\u201d\u201cHmm? Jealous?\u201d Su Yunluo almost thought she had heard wrong.\u201cYes, I\u2019m jealous. My Luo Luo is so beautiful. There must be many boys chasing you. They have all played some role in your growth in one way or another, while I didn\u2019t have that destiny to meet you. I missed your growth because I met you only after you graduated college.\u201d Gu Yiyin expressed that he was really jealous.Su Yunluo felt crying and laughed while listening to the man\u2019s words, but she was very touched. This man had probably really loved her to the core to be this way.Su Yunluo cupped his face and spoke petulantly, \u201cMr. Gu, it\u2019s them who should be jealous because they are only passing visitors in my past life, while you are my present and future. We are going to grow together for a long time.\u201dHearing the woman\u2019s words, Gu Yiyin was suddenly in a better mood. Yes, the past did not mean anything; what mattered was the present and the future, and he would live with Luo Luo for the rest of his life.When the evening came, Su Yunluo took Gu Yiyin out to eat the specialties of H City. Yang Peishan proposed to go together, so the two-person trip became a four-person trip.Yang Pei Shan\u2019s mood was low as she watched Gu Yiyin treat Su Yunluo with care at the dinner table, while Su Yunting beside her was indifferent to her.There was a cultural square in H city. Inside was a wishing pond, where coins were thrown, and wishes were made. The wishes would come true, so it became a must-see attraction for foreigners visiting the city.Su Yunluo dragged Gu Yiyin to the wishing pond, \u201cYiyin, let\u2019s throw a coin and make a wish. It\u2019s very special .\u201dSo, the two threw a coin into the wishing pond and then closed their eyes to make a wish. Yang Peishan liked to try, asking Su Yunting to take a coin, but he shook his head and said no. She was uncomfortable asking Gu Yiyin for a coin, so she had to regretfully give up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gu Yiyin sat beside her, accompanying her to flip through it.To compensate for Gu Yiyin\u2019s regret, Su Yunluo asked her mother to bring the photo album about her. Father and Mother Su began making albums belonging to the two siblings after they were born. One for each of them, which contained full of memories.\u201cLook, this is what I looked like when I was born.\u201d Su Yunluo pointed to one of them and spoke.In the photo, Su Yunluo was wrinkled and tiny. Her eyes were not open, and her little fists were clenched, so she could not see the beauty. Next to the photo were her birth data, including the date, weight, height, and so on.Seeing the weight column, Gu Yiyin couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow, \u201cSo Luo Luo was so heavy at birth, nearly 8 pounds.\u201d\u201cYes. Mother said that when she was pregnant with me, she was very good at eating. And I was very naughty in her belly and loved to move, often making her sleep poorly at night. It took some effort to give birth to me because of my large size.\u201d Su Yunluo spoke.The two turned over page by page. The first time she turned over, the first time she grew teeth, the first time she crawled. Many precious firsts were recorded by her parents.\u201cThis one was taken when you were a few years old?\u201d Gu Yiyin pointed to a photo of Su Yunluo in tears.\u201cThis one? Let\u2019s see.\u201d Su Yunluo pondered, then revealed a smile.\u201dThis was taken when I was six years old. At that time, a little boy was next door, one year older than me. He looked chubby and cute, and everyone called him \u201cLittle Fatty.\u201d Little Fatty was terrible when he was young. He loved to bully me. I was so angry once he stole my ice cream that I burst into tears, so I filmed it.\u201d\u201cSo, did you go home to tell your parents?\u201d Gu Yiyin looked curious.\u201cNo, but I complained to the auntie next door, and Little Fatty was scolded. The next day, the auntie brought Little Fatty to apologize and bought me a big container of ice cream.\u201d Su Yunluo smiled with a smug face.\u201cBut Little Fatty is not fat now. After high school, he went to the army and is now a handsome soldier brother. He found a beautiful girlfriend and will get married next month.\u201d Su Yunluo looked sentimental.Gu Yiyin listened to Su Yunluo recount the story behind each photo. It was as if he had witnessed her growth and felt indescribably wonderful.The next day, Su Yunluo took Gu Yiyin back to the countryside to visit her grandparents, and Su Yunting and Yang Peishan also went.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After moving away from the city, the road was a bit bumpy. Since Su Yunting and Gu Yiyin were men, they were physically fit, and this bumpy road was nothing; Su Yunluo went back to the countryside whenever she had time, so she was familiar with the road conditions here and was very energetic along the way; but Yang Peishan, who had grown up in the city, suffered from the bumpy road. She puked all the way back to the countryside. When she got off the bus, her face was pale.As soon as she got off the bus, Su Yunluo dragged Gu Yiyin to walk around. Not long after, she saw two plainly dressed old men watering strawberries in a strawberry garden not far away.Su Yunluo\u2019s eyes lit up and ran over, \u201cGrandparents.\u201dThe two old people heard a familiar voice. They looked up and saw Su Yunluo running their way, and a smile appeared on both of their faces.\u201cLuo Luo is on vacation.\u201d Grandma Su looked at her with a loving face.\u201cYes. This time, I came to introduce you to someone, and my brother also brought his friend over.\u201d Su Yunluo finished and turned her head to look at the three people walking behind her.The three people came closer. Su Yunluo took Gu Yiyin\u2019s arm and introduced him, \u201cGrandparents, this is my boyfriend, Gu Yiyin.\u201d\u201cGrandpa Su. Grandma Su. Hello. I\u2019m Gu Yiyin, Luo Luo\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d Gu Yiyin said respectfully.\u201cGood, good.\u201d the two old men of the Su family looked at the talented Gu Yiyin and couldn\u2019t stop nodding their heads.Su Yunting and Yang Peishan also greeted. Su Yunting\u2019s attitude was as cold as ever, but Yang Peishan was quite enthusiastic, and her mouth was full of grandpa and grandma.They walked towards the house. The two old people of the Su family had retired and had nothing to do. They opened a farmhouse in the countryside, and the ingredients were from their gardens, which were fresh and attracted many tourists. In addition, they also opened a bed and breakfast for travelers who came from far away to spend the night.After the guests settled down at the B&amp;B and took a short rest, Su Yunluo dragged Gu Yiyin to the garden to pick vegetables. Many vegetables were growing: winter squash, pumpkin, loofah, beetroot, and baby cabbage.Yang Peishan volunteered to help, but instead, she did a disservice by picking off the vegetables that were not yet ripe. When Su Yunluo saw this, she told her to stop, and Yang Peishan only smiled apologetically.Everyone was picking vegetables, and she was too embarrassed to stay idle, so she helped pass water and put the picked vegetables into the basket.Since they were in the countryside, they had to eat farmhouse food. In the evening, Grandma Su cooked a table of hearty farmhouse food. Although not as much as the city\u2019s fancy, the quality was better because of the freshness, with its own flavor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His tongue licked and rolled hard and sucked, leaving deep and shallow traces.The two of them had not done it for several days. It was torture for the man to hold the soft body every night that he could see but not touch.Ever since he tasted her, the man became addicted. Whenever possible, he was eager to kiss her, hold her, and love her. The so-called self-control was challenging to deal with in front of her.\u201cMmm.\u201d The woman spilled out a soft moan. The soft white fingertips roamed the man\u2019s back, provoking the man with a shuddering sensation.The woman\u2019s bathrobe was loosely tied, and the whole round puffy breasts were hidden. The man pulled open the woman\u2019s bathrobe, and the two mounds stood proudly. The tip of the nipple at the top was an attractive pink.Gu Yiyin opened his mouth and took one side in, caressing it with his lips and tongue. The tongue swept the pink cherry. The tip of his tongue twirled and sucked, making the tip of her chest as hard as a red bean.A large and thick palm crawled up to the other peak. He kneaded and played with it like a dough. That soft flesh changed into various shapes in the man\u2019s palm, which was very sexy.\u201cMmm.\u201d The woman\u2019s pink lips parted, panting. Her breast stood high for the man to play with, and her fine fingers thrust into the man\u2019s hair and fiddled with them, giving vent to the pleasure inside her.\u201cMmmm.\u201d The man\u2019s finger penetrated the woman\u2019s p*ssy at some point, and the woman contracted in shock, sucking it tightly.The man caressed and gouged the bulging nub with his thumb. The woman\u2019s sensitive spot was stimulated, and she oozed a sweet love juice, which facilitated the movement of the man\u2019s finger.With the much love juice, the man\u2019s finger in the woman\u2019s tight hole pumped back and forth. The knuckles bent to dig the sensitive points of the woman\u2019s spot. With each thrust, the rough finger cut against the sensitive and tender walls, stimulating, again and again, to contract powerfully.After confirming that the woman was wet enough, the man pulled out his finger. The woman was a little uncomfortable with the sudden departure of his finger. Her p*ssy opened and closed as if to say she was waiting.The man left the woman\u2019s body, removed his underwear with one hand, and unleashed his hard and swollen organ: a thick and long one surrounded by veins. The glans was the size of a goose egg, with a few drops of mucus oozing from the tip.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He sent himself in by sinking his waist, and the glans broke through the layers of flesh to reach the woman\u2019s center. The man didn\u2019t pause much, and his waist started moving one after the other.\u201cAh-ha! So deep.\u201d The woman moaned delicately. Her long legs were tightly coiled around the man\u2019s healthy waist, and she endured the man\u2019s rapid thrusts inside her.The woman\u2019s voice was charming and beautiful, like the strongest aphrodisiac that aroused the man\u2019s lust. Gu Yiyin pinched the woman\u2019s soft waist, and his lower body was like a jackhammer thrusting fast and hard into the woman\u2019s hole.The sound of flesh slapping resounded through the room. Their pubic bones collided, their lower bodies were wet, and the sweet-smelling love juices were squeezed out along their union. And with the high speed of the meat stick going in and out, they ground into a fine white foam clinging to the soft pubic hair.\u201cMmmm ah. Too fast. Ummmm. Ahhhh.\u201d The woman\u2019s fingers scratched at the man\u2019s back. The scratching made a red mark, and the painful tingling sensation in his back stimulated the man, even more, making his thrusts faster and heavier.The rod changed different angles and was forced to insert deeply into the woman\u2019s body. Each thrust brought a distinct pleasure to the woman. Her p*ssy contracted endlessly. The flesh of her hole was spontaneously wriggling and sucking as if it had an autonomous consciousness when the man penetrated. It wrapped tightly around the man\u2019s rod and licked every inch of the surface, bringing the man pleasure as if he had ascended to heaven.Gu Yiyin entered all in, all out, and continued to thrust. The two sacks hit the woman\u2019s p*ssy with a sweet red, and the two flower lips were rubbed red and swollen.\u201cAha. Mmm. Yiyin. Mmmmm. Can\u2019t.\u201d More and more pleasure piled up in the woman\u2019s body. Not long after, the woman screamed and was sent to climax.The warm juices poured over the man\u2019s glans, and the climaxing cavern was incredibly tight, frantically contracting and squeezing the man\u2019s rod. The man couldn\u2019t hold back any longer and gave a few hard thrusts. He released at the woman\u2019s womanhood the pent-up essence that had been building up for days.The man stroked the woman\u2019s naked back and, from time to time, bowed his head to give her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cBaby, comfortable?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was husky, a characteristic of the aftermath of a love affair.The woman was shy and annoyed and punched him in the chest. Her face was red, and she refused to answer his question. The man\u2019s chest vibrated, signaling his now incomparably pleasurable mood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since she was accustomed to eating fine food, she was not accustomed to eating the countryside farming food. She vomited and had diarrhea for two days, and half of her vacation was consumed.She hardly recovered, yet it happened that it rained. This time the weather was ever-changing. Yang Peishan\u2019s physique was weak, so she caught a cold. Initially, she wanted to take advantage of this holiday to cultivate a good relationship with Su Yunting, but her body did not have the strength. Yang Peishan was depressed.This morning, Su Yunluo felt some nausea and dry vomiting, and she did not think much about it. However, looking at the usual meals at noon, she again felt uncomfortable and could not resist going to the bathroom to throw up.When the experienced female colleague beside her saw this, she cautiously asked, \u201cLuo Luo, you\u2019re not pregnant, are you?\u201dSu Yunluo froze, then shook her head, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. My monthly period has already come and gone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better to go to the hospital to check it out,\u201d the female colleague spoke worriedly.Su Yunluo thought it was right, so she left work early this afternoon to go to the hospital. The doctor suggested that she go to the obstetrics and gynecology department to have a look. Su Yunluo half-heartedly registered with the obstetrics and gynecology department.The result of the gynecological and obstetrical examination was that she was pregnant. Su Yunluo looked puzzled, \u201cBut doctor, I already had my period this month, so how could I be pregnant?\u201dThe doctor smiled and answered her, \u201cMiss Su, due to individual differences, some women will still have their periods in the early stages of pregnancy. It\u2019s just that the amount of menstruation will be much less than usual.\u201dAfter listening to the doctor\u2019s answer, Su Yunluo suddenly realized: That no wonder this month\u2019s volume is indeed less than before. She thought it was due to an abnormal diet, and how could she not expect to be pregnant? However, considering she was pregnant, Su Yunluo could not stop rejoicing inside. He should also be delighted.When she returned home in the evening, Su Yunluo told Gu Yiyin about this. He was stunned at first, then ecstatic, \u201cThat\u2019s great. You\u2019re wonderful.\u201d He held Su Yunluo\u2019s face and gave her a fierce kiss.Gu Yiyin had planned to propose to Su Yunluo on her birthday next month.

Both parents were delighted, discussing and deliberating. Both sides decided to get a marriage license and then hold a wedding after the child\u2019s birth. For one thing, marriage was complicated, and Su Yunluo\u2019s pregnancy was unsuitable for overwork. For another, Su Yunluo\u2019s idea of being a beautiful bride was taken into account, and she did not want to walk down the aisle with a big belly.So, on a windy and sunny day, the two went to the Civil Affairs Bureau to get a marriage license and officially became husband and wife. Considering the child, Su Yunluo quit her job and stayed home to raise her baby.To take care of Su Yunluo, Mother Gu asked the couple to move in with them first, and then they could move back when the baby was born. So, the two lived at the old house where his parents lived.Su Yunluo\u2019s pregnancy was not too bad, except for the occasional morning sickness and drowsiness, but otherwise, it was average as expected. Under the attentive care of Mother Gu and Gu Yiyin, Su Yunluo was nourished to be white and fat. Her face was rosy, and she looked very good.Since she was pregnant, Su Yunluo became increasingly pampered and clingy. Each morning, looking at Su Yunluo holding her belly and looking at him with watery eyes, Gu Yiyin couldn\u2019t take a step: What should I do? Being pregnant makes her so cute.Late that night, Gu Yiyin returned home. Three days ago, there was a problem with a project in the field, and he had to go and solve it personally. Gu Yiyin had no choice but to leave Su Yunluo to his mother\u2019s care and hurriedly rush to the field.The good news was that the problem wasn\u2019t severe and was quickly solved. So, Gu Yiyin took the earliest flight back that night to see Su Yunluo earlier. Moreover, she had a maternity checkup early tomorrow morning, and he didn\u2019t want to miss it.Gu Yiyin turned on the light in the room and walked gently to the bedside. Su Yunluo was sleeping, and her face was calm and soft. Through the blanket, he could see her bulging belly, which was their child. Thinking of this, Gu Yiyin\u2019s expression was even softer.He took out his clothes and went into the bathroom to shower. He carefully lifted the blanket and got under the covers, embracing Su Yunluo in his arms. Feeling the familiar embrace, Su Yunluo squinted her eyes and spoke dazedly, \u201cYiyin?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Gu Yiyin gently stroked her belly. The baby also seemed to know that daddy was back and greeted him through her stomach. Feeling the movement under his palm, Gu Yiyin was delighted.A kiss was imprinted on her forehead. Gu Yiyin gently patted her back to lull her to sleep and closed his eyes to go to dreamland.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Su Yunluo was lying on the bed in the ultrasound room, and the physician moved the instrument to her belly.A short while later, the baby\u2019s four-dimensional ultrasound appeared on the monitor. \u201cCongratulations, it\u2019s a baby girl,\u201d the doctor smiled and spoke.At that, both of them were delighted. The couple didn\u2019t care about the gender of the baby, and as long as it was healthy, it was good. Nevertheless, it would be convenient for them to buy baby products if they knew the gender earlier.\u201cThe baby is 24 weeks old and is developing well. Her legs are long, and she will be a long-legged beauty in the future.\u201d The doctor carefully described the baby\u2019s current development, and both Gu Yiyin and Su Yunluo listened with serious faces.After the maternity examination, Gu Yiyin helped Su Yunluo out of the obstetrics and gynecology department. Unexpectedly, they ran into Yang Peishan here.Yang Peishan saw them and was a little embarrassed. But she still took the initiative to say hello, \u201cLuo Luo, Mr. Gu.\u201d\u201cMiss Yang,\u201d Su Yunluo spoke. She looked at the ultrasound film in Yang Peishan\u2019s hand, and her gaze was fixed: That\u2019s not?Yang Peishan noticed Su Yunluo\u2019s gaze and stuffed it casually into her bag, \u201cLuoluo, I still have something to do. I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d After that, Yang Peishan left in a hurry. How was it that it looked like she was running away?Su Yunluo felt strange: How did Yang Peishan appear in the obstetrics and gynecology department? Could she be pregnant too? That child might be my brother\u2019s? Unable to understand, Su Yunluo simply stopped thinking. Anyway, they would definitely know later.It didn\u2019t take long for the news to come that Su Yunting was getting married to Yang Peishan. Mother Su told her that Yang Peishan was pregnant with Su Yunting\u2019s child and was about three months old. Yang Peishan saw that she couldn\u2019t hide it and told President Yang, who wanted Su Yunting to be responsible for her, so things turned out this way.Su Yunting wanted to get married in a low-profile manner, but President Yang had only one daughter, Yang Peishan, so he had to make a big deal. So, the two families held a grand wedding at a hotel in B City.At the wedding, Yang Peishan smiled sweetly. Su Yunting was as cold as ever, and the marriage did not make him much happier.Time continued to pass, and gradually it was nearing Su Yunluo\u2019s due date. Gu Yiyin did not work and spent the whole day at Su Yunluo\u2019s side. He was very nervous as soon as there was any wind or movement.This night, Su Yunluo woke up in pain in the middle of the night. She felt her lower body was wet. Her water had broken, and her stomach was regularly hurting. She shook Gu Yiyin awake, \u201cYiyin, my water has broken.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hearing her say that her water had broken, he panicked and then calmed down. He dressed her neatly, took all the birth kits he had prepared, called Mother Gu, and then made their way to the hospital.Outside the operating room, listening to the high and low sound of pain inside, Gu Yiyin was anxious. \u201cMom, why is it taking so long to give birth?\u201dMother Gu on the side was calm, \u201cOnly an hour or so inside, and it\u2019s still early.\u201dAnd in the operating room, Su Yunluo was sweating profusely. Her lips were white from biting, and her lower body kept pushing, trying to give birth to the child.The nurse on the side encouraged her, \u201cMrs. Gu, push harder. We\u2019re about to see the baby\u2019s head.\u201dSu Yunluo followed the nurse\u2019s instructions. She took a deep breath and then worked hard on her lower body. Finally, she felt a lightness underneath her, and then a loud baby cry sounded.The surgical lights went out, and the nurse came out and spoke, \u201cWhich of you is a family member?\u201d\u201cMe!\u201d Mother Gu and Gu Yiyin spoke in unison.\u201cCongratulations, mother and daughter are safe,\u201d the nurse spoke with a smile.At that, the two of them breathed a sigh of relief. Gu Yiyin asked, \u201cWhat about my wife?\u201d\u201cMs. Su passed out from fatigue. She and the baby will be cleaned later and sent to the general ward,\u201d the nurse explained.When Su Yunluo woke up, it was late in the evening. She was cleaned, but there was some hidden pain in her lower body. Gu Yiyin was watching her without moving an inch. When she woke up, he looked concerned, \u201cLuo Luo, you\u2019re awake. Is there anything else uncomfortable?\u201dSu Yunluo shook her head. She made a gesture to sit up from the bed. Gu Yiyin hurriedly helped her up and stuffed a pillow behind her waist.\u201cWhere is the baby?\u201d Su Yunluo asked.\u201cThe baby is in the incubator, and she will be delivered later. Eat something first.\u201d Gu Yiyin spoke softly, and he opened the thermos beside her and fed her porridge.After drinking most of the bowl, Su Yunluo said she was full. At this time, the nurse was wheeled into the incubator.After asking the nurse, Gu Yiyin carefully took the baby out of the incubator. The baby was sleeping with her little fists clenched. Her features were wrinkled, and for the moment, they couldn\u2019t see who she looked like.\u201cShe\u2019s so small.\u201d Su Yunluo picked up the baby. It was a wonderful feeling to feel the tiny soft mass nestled in her arms.

Su Yunluo was well taken care of within the month. Her face was rosy, her figure was slender, and she did not look like she had given birth to a child. The baby also looked beautiful, white, and soft. She loved to laugh and was not afraid. She was so peaceful and cute that it made people feel good.The baby was still tiny, and she was not suitable for festive occasions. Therefore, they did not set up anything, but the two families sat together to eat.\u201cGrandpa\u2019s sweetheart.\u201d Father Gu teased the baby in the cradle on the side of the dining table.The baby\u2019s name was Gu Zihan, and her nickname was Mian Mian. As the youngest member of the family, Gu Zihan was spoiled. Especially the grandparents were cautious with her. The Gu family had not had a baby girl for three generations, so it was not easy to expect a granddaughter. She was so soft and cute, so they were delighted.Gu Zihan was extraordinarily trouble-free. In addition to crying once or twice when her tummy was hungry, or her diaper was wet, she rarely cried at any other time.At this time, Mian Mian\u2019s mouth flattened and looked like she was about to cry out. Father Gu was immediately distressed, \u201cLuo Luo, Mian Mian is hungry, right?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I fed her an hour ago, so I think she\u2019s peeing.\u201d Su Yunluo touched the wrapped diaper, and it was time to change it.Su Yunluo picked her up from the cradle and was about to return to her room, but Gu Yiyin took it from her, \u201cLet me do it.\u201d After saying that, Gu Yiyin carried Mian Mian back to her room, skillfully changed her diaper, and hugged her.After changing the diaper, Gu Mian Mian stayed in her father\u2019s arms with a well-behaved face and a particularly soft smile.\u201cBrother-in-law is so good at taking care of babies,\u201d said Yang Peishan, a little envious.\u201cBrother will also be a good father in the future,\u201d Su Yunluo spoke with a smile.Yang Peishan stroked her bulging belly and looked at Su Yunting sitting beside her, smiling with happiness.After sending off both sides of the family, the whole house was left with Gu Yiyin\u2019s family of three. After a long day, Mian Mian was also sleepy, so Su Yunluo fed her once and put her to sleep.When she returned to her room, Gu Yiyin leaned against the bed, reading a book. \u201cIs Mian Mian asleep?\u201d He asked in a soft voice.\u201cMmm,\u201d Su Yunluo answered him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gu Yiyin was a bit puzzled and saw Su Yunluo kissing his lips as she blushed. Ever since Su Yunluo was pregnant, Gu Yiyin hadn\u2019t touched her. Now that the baby was born and she was no longer in her first month, it was time to resume everyday married life.Gu Yiyin first froze, and then he slowly smiled and kissed the woman back tenderly.The man\u2019s gentle kisses made the woman gradually sink, and her body softened into a puddle of water in the man\u2019s arms. \u201cLuo Luo.\u201d The man made his way down, kissing, using his lips and tongue to worship the woman\u2019s soft snowy skin. Everywhere he went, he left behind vivid hickeys.\u201cMmmm.\u201d The woman unconsciously let out a delicate moan. At some point, the man\u2019s lips and tongue came to the base of her thighs and licked and kissed the piece of skin on her inner thighs. The tip of his tongue circled ambiguously around that tender skin, sipping it from time to time until the woman panted and panted before he let go.The woman\u2019s legs were opened to the sides, and the scenery between her legs was viewed: the petals were pink and tender, and the middle was a tightly closed slit. Occasionally a few drops of nectar oozed out, and a raised nucleus emerged from the top of the flower, which looked shy.The man\u2019s thin lips covered it, caressing it carefully. He took in the nub, licking and sucking with his tongue, nibbling and rubbing his teeth. The bullying made the spot red and swollen.\u201cMmmm. No. Yiyin.\u201d Su Yunluo squirmed impatiently, and waves of pleasure came from her lower body that felt like a tidal wave. She burst with warm nectar.The man greedily swallowed the woman\u2019s juices. His lips increased the force to tease a few points, and his tongue curled up and stabbed the woman\u2019s narrow canal, mimicking the movement of the s*x organ back and forth.\u201cMmmm ah. Don\u2019t. Too exciting.\u201d The woman\u2019s legs clamped the man\u2019s head in place, with her p*ssy contracting and squeezing the man\u2019s tongue, trying to push it out in vain.Soon, her sensitive body shivered and climbed to climax. The man looked up between her legs, and his thin lips were covered with the woman\u2019s nectar. He licked it and got up and wrapped Su Yunluo, kissing her panting mouth without saying a word.Su Yunluo tasted her private parts in his mouth, which was salty with a fishy sweetness, and the two kissed each other passionately.The man put himself between the woman\u2019s legs while she was in a state of ecstasy. The thick s*x organ kept grinding against the sensitive flower. With the lubrication of the nectar, the glans sank in, and then it was held tightly in place.Gu Yiyin left her lips a little, \u201cLuo Luo, relax a little. I can\u2019t get in,\u201d he said while rubbing and pressing her nub.The canal gushed another stream of nectar. Sensing that the woman had relaxed, the man could get a good shot and sink his waist. He inserted his rod entirely into the woman\u2019s body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At first, the speed was not very fast, and it was not until the woman\u2019s hole became wetter that the man gradually increased his movements.The \u201csnapping\u201d sound of flesh slapping in the room, accompanied by the ambiguous panting of the man and woman, makes people blush and pulsate.The man grabbed the woman\u2019s slim waist and kept thrusting in her tightness. The constant friction between the stick and the sensitized cavern walls brought a burst of intense pleasure.\u201cMmmm ah. So fast. Husband. Ah ha.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was charming and moving. Feeling the man\u2019s s*x organ pounding furiously inside her, her body was tingling.The snow-white plumpness jumped up and down on her chest, nearly making the man\u2019s eyes flash. Gu Yiyin covered one of the sides. His big palm gently kneaded and watched the smooth snow mass turn into various shapes according to his intention.The woman was still lactating, and her breasts were sensitive. When the man gently pinched her, a small stream of milk sprayed from her nipples. The man leaned over and licked it, and the sweet milk made the man very happy. He took one side of the nipple and sucked greedily like a baby drinking milk. The sweet milk entered his mouth in one gulp and was swallowed into his stomach.\u201cMmmm ah. So comfortable.\u201d The woman looked down and saw the man buried in her breast and sucking milk. Unlike when a baby sucked milk, the man would bite the nipple with his teeth and nibble and rub it, making the woman ache and comforted.At the same time, the man\u2019s lower body was racing. The meat stick stroked inside her tight, juicy canal almost without pause. The thick s*x organ was pushing open the incredibly tight hole, repeatedly bringing out warm nectar with each pull.\u201cMmmm. Husband. So deep. Mmmm.\u201d The woman chanted. Her insides squirmed and contracted when the man\u2019s rod was inserted. The flesh was like a small mouth clinging to the man\u2019s pole, sucking and squeezing inch by inch\u2026 as if to squeeze out the essence inside.The man\u2019s forehead had already gathered a layer of sweat beads. The woman was wet and tight, strangling and sucking his rod. It almost made him lose all his senses, only wanting to do so, never to part.\u201cBaby.\u201d The man lovingly and deeply kissed the woman\u2019s red lips, and his lower body ruthlessly pounded down the woman\u2019s wet and slippery cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Love juice was ground into a circle of white foam clinging at the entrance of her point, and the two flower lips got slightly turned outward by the insertion. The opening of her hole clenched tightly on the man\u2019s s*x organ with one contraction after another.Su Yunluo\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but shed physical tears. Her red lips were blocked by the man\u2019s thin lips repeatedly sucking and kissing. The fluid she failed to swallow hung at the corners of her mouth.The man fiercely impaled, all in, all out, deep into the woman\u2019s center. He pounded that spot, again and again, loosening and making it soft, bubbling the nectar out.After kissing the woman\u2019s red lips, the man turned to explore the rest of the woman\u2019s body. He had to leave his mark on his favorite toy like a child.The woman\u2019s body was covered with a bruise and purple hickeys. The man kissed meticulously and re-covered with a new layer.\u201cMmmm ah. Husband. Aha. Umm.\u201d Su Yunluo only felt the pleasure and comfort inside her body. The man\u2019s hot and swollen s*x organ was thrusting back and forth inside her as if she was in no man\u2019s land. She could even feel every inch of his vein rubbing against her flesh.The man stared intensely at his wife. Her face was full of passion, her watery eyes, her red lips constantly moaning seductively, and her lower body was as soft as a blossoming flower, withstanding his wild thrusts. The man could see how enchanting she was. Thinking of this, the man\u2019s s*x organ grew another size.\u201cMmmmmmm. No. Don\u2019t.\u201d Su Yunluo voiced a delicate and soft plea for mercy. The man\u2019s physical strength was good beyond words. She felt it had been long, but the man did not show any sign of coming, and she could only beg for mercy.However, her aggrieved little girl look would only make the man want to bully her even harder.Gu Yiyin\u2019s waist and hips raced. The meat stick squeezed through the two flower lips and rammed in hard, pulling out and even pulling out the red flesh. The cycle was repeated again and again.\u201cOoooo. Good no.\u201d Su Yunluo whimpered and begged for mercy. She contracted hard, trying to make the man finish.\u201cHiss. Don\u2019t squeeze.\u201d The man gritted his teeth to resist the urge to have an outburst. He coaxed, \u201cBe good. Hold back a little longer. Soon.\u201dThe man once again accelerated his thrusting tempo, ruthlessly hitting the bulging nub of flesh. After thrusting like this a few times, Su Yunluo shivered and released a massive stream of nectar. The man no longer held back, and the essence was released. He shot all the hot stuff inside the woman.After good s*x, Su Yunluo felt extremely tired. She closed her eyes and quickly fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a happy event, but Su Yunting\u2019s and his parents\u2019 faces were ugly.It turned out that the baby Yang Peishan delivered was defective, and the missing chromosomes in his body would cause the baby\u2019s intellectual development to be impaired, which is commonly known as \u201cmental retardation.\u201dFather Yang invited the country\u2019s most famous brain experts to come to the baby\u2019s diagnosis, but the results did not look too good once they came out.Through the examination, the brain specialist diagnosed that the baby\u2019s disease was hereditary and that one of the parents had a chromosomal abnormality, which caused the baby\u2019s condition.So, both Su Yunting and Yang Peishan went for a chromosome test, and the results were acceptable. If the baby was born by Yang Peishan, then it could only mean one fact: The baby was not Su Yunting\u2019s!As the truth was in front of her, Yang Peishan had to admit: The baby was indeed not Su Yunting\u2019s. She had exhausted all methods beforehand, all of which were not successful.Previously she used every method but could not move Su Yunting. In desperation, she drugged Su Yunting, then took off their clothes and lay on the bed together, creating the illusion that they were having s*x.She initially thought that \u201cthe rice was cooked,\u201d and Su Yunting would be responsible for her even if he did not like her. However, Su Yunting did not take the one-night stand seriously, and she had strong self-esteem and was unwilling to tell her father about it. As a last resort, she found a man to do artificial insemination. She waited until she was pregnant and pretended not to let her father find out. Her father was distressed. So, he forced Su Yunting to take responsibility.Su Yunting then also accepted. It did not matter to him who he married, but marrying Yang Peishan was helpful to his career. But he would never have imagined that the child was not his, which was a disgrace for a man!Yang Peishan also did not know that things would develop in this way. That man was found by an agent, who was greedy and cheap. In addition, Yang Peishan\u2019s side was pressing, so she took the man for a random physical examination, and the result was this.Yang Peishan was weak and hurt having a baby, so she couldn\u2019t get pregnant again. Su Yunting couldn\u2019t accept the two of them, and Yang Peishan refused to get a divorce, so things were a little difficult to resolve.Su Yunluo heard all this from Mother Su. She comforted her by speaking, \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry about this. Brother will work it out. You must believe that the boat will come to the bridge naturally.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Mother Su sighed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mother Su understood her daughter\u2019s meaning and stopped thinking about it, and she spoke to her about the details related to the wedding.Su Yunluo was sitting in the living room writing wedding invitations, and from time to time, she distracted herself by glancing at Gu Mian Mian beside her.Gu Mian Mian was eight months old and loved to laugh and crawl. Also, she crawled very fast and would go away if she didn\u2019t pay attention. So, Su Yunluo used a fence to enclose a large area in the living room, which was covered with soft cushions. Adults could sit inside and work, and the baby could play without crawling far away.Su Yunluo was writing well when suddenly the hem of her dress was tugged. She looked down and saw Gu Mian Mian tugging at her dress, her mouth speaking a language she didn\u2019t know and showing a few baby teeth.Su Yunluo held her in her arms and gave her a kiss. Little Gu Mian Mian only knew how to giggle, and her little hands were clapping straight.\u201cWhat is our little Mian Mian happy about? Are you happy because mommy and daddy are going to have a wedding?\u201d Su Yunluo smiled gently.\u201cWhen the time comes, little Mian Mian will be mommy and daddy\u2019s flower girl, okay?\u201d Su Yunluo shook Gu Mian Mian\u2019s little hand.\u201cAh. Oh,\u201d Gu Mian Mian made a single sound to express her thoughts.\u201cOur Mian Mian promised, didn\u2019t she? What a good baby. Let mommy give her a kiss.\u201d Su Yunluo picked her up and gave her a kiss. Gu Mian Mian then giggled.Gu Yiyin, who had just returned home, looked at this loving scene, and his face softened.In the end, Yang Peishan and Su Yunting got divorced. Yang Pei Shan took the child home, and her father helped take care of the child; Su Yunting resigned from the company of Mr. Yang\u2019s family and went abroad to explore. He did not even come back for Su Yunluo\u2019s wedding but sent her a wedding gift. Mother Su inevitably felt slightly disappointed, but the next day was Su Yunluo\u2019s wedding; she was still pleased.The following day, Su Yunluo was called up to do her makeup. Because of nervousness, she didn\u2019t sleep much the night before, but she still had a good spirit.The man and woman could not meet for three days before the wedding, so Su Yunluo went to live in the hotel three days ago.She put on her makeup, put on her wedding dress, and just sat on the bed quietly waiting. Mother Su sat to chat with her to ease her emotions, and there was her circle of sisters in the room discussing how to make things difficult for the groom.After a while, there was a commotion at the door, and the groom came over to pick her up. The bridesmaids made it difficult for Gu Yiyin, but they were easily defeated. Later, the groomsmen said all the right things and gave red envelopes, so they were let in.Su Yunluo just sat there, watching Gu Yiyin step towards her. The smile at the corner of his lips was gentle and intoxicating, \u201cLuo Luo, I came to pick you up.\u201dSu Yunluo looked at him with a happy smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t cry. Our daughter has become like this, and we can\u2019t crumble. Or else how can we take care of her?\u201d\u201cHusband, our daughter will definitely wake up, right?\u201d The woman\u2019s eyes were full of hope.\u201cYes. We have to trust the doctors,\u201d the man said, but he felt that there was little hope.The two people looked at the young woman lying in the hospital bed. The woman was about twenty-four or twenty-five, pale but could not hide her beautiful appearance. However, the woman who should be vibrant was lying here due to an accident, and it was unknown whether she would wake up.On the side, Su Yunluo looked at the scene before her and felt shocked. What shocked her the most was that the woman on the hospital bed looked exactly like her!Su Yunluo urgently called the system [System, what the hell is going on here?!][Uh. This. Host. The woman on the hospital bed is you in this world.] System stammered in reply.[Then this is my soul out of the body?] Su Yunluo continued to press the issue.[In a sense, it is. But host, you are different from those ordinary souls because you are a living soul.] The system spoke.What was a living soul? Su Yunluo was confused by its remarks.The system slowly said [The so-called living soul refers to the human body because of artificial or objective factors. The living soul is different from others and can walk freely in the sunlight like a person doing the same things. Will also feel pain the same as people, except that others can not see it.]Su Yunluo nodded in understanding, [when can I return to this body?]The system looked troubled [Host, your current state of soul is fragile. For a while, you can not return to your body.]Su Yunluo also sensed her state. She spoke, no longer making things difficult for it [Tell me briefly about the plot of this world.]So, the system transmitted the story of this world to her: The original Su Yunluo came from a scholarly family. Grandparents and parents were famous in education, whereas the male lead Xu Xiangchen and supporting male Jiang Hanfei were Father Su\u2019s students.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xu Xiangchen was gentle and elegant, a gentleman and soft-spoken, and very popular with girls; Jiang Hanfei was unruly, with a pair of peach blossom eyes that were very seductive, giving a philandering feeling.Su Yunluo liked Xu Xiangchen very much and confessed her love to him on one of his birthdays, and they became boyfriend and girlfriend. After graduating from college, the two were ready to get married, but at that time, Xu Xiangchen\u2019s ex-girlfriend returned. Xu Xiangchen had a girlfriend when he was a sophomore, called Bai Yunyun. The two were in love in a high-key way, but then Bai Yunyun left the country. The two broke up, for which Xu Xiangchen was sad for a long time.Now she came back when he was about to get married, asking to get back together. Xu Xiangchen remembered all the past with her, and he became indecisive. This also gave Bai Yunyun a chance to take advantage. The two had s*x after drinking, and Su Yunluo caught them in bed under Bai Yunyun\u2019s scheme.Su Yunluo was devastated and broke up and left in tears. She didn\u2019t tell her father and mother about the incident. Fearing that she would be exposed, she found an excuse to move out. Later, Jiang Hanfei learned about the incident and was uneasy about Su Yunluo being alone, so he lent her an apartment in his name to live in.Afterward, Xu Xiangchen found Su Yunluo and wanted to explain. Su Yunluo was accidentally hit by a passing car to avoid him, so she became like this.After receiving the plot, Su Yunluo just wanted to curse: What a scum!Just after cursing him in her heart, the scumbag came. Seeing him, both Father Su and Mother Su were furious. \u201cWho allowed you to come? Get the hell out of here!\u201d Mother Su spoke sternly.Xu Xiangchen had a guilty face, \u201cTeacher, Ma\u2019am, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201dFather Su still managed to remain calm, but his voice was full of disappointment, \u201cXiangchen, this is a hospital. I do not want to argue with you. But there is one thing I have to say. As a man, you are too indecisive. If it were not so, my daughter would not be lying here.\u201dXu Xiangchen looked at the unconscious Su Yunluo and was full of self-blame. At this time, Jiang Hanfei also hurriedly arrived. When Father Su saw him, his face became peaceful.\u201cTeacher, Ma\u2019am, how is Luo Luo\u2019s condition now?\u201dJiang Hanfei urgently spoke.\u201cThe doctor said that Luo Luo\u2019s injury is too serious.

[System, how will I approach Jiang Hanfei in this state now?][Don\u2019t worry. You have a golden finger in this world, and only Jiang Hanfei can see you.] The system spoke.[What conditions do I need to activate it?] Su Yunluo spoke.[This. Only needs a few of the host\u2019s points.] Under Su Yunluo\u2019s gaze, the system\u2019s heart weakened.There was no way. Su Yunluo could only bear the pain and agree for the sake of the mission.That evening, Jiang Hanfei returned to his apartment in Xinghe Bay. He had several properties under his name while he lived here in the country. When Su Yunluo moved out of the family house, he lent it to her. He moved to another apartment or stayed in a hotel.Jiang Hanfei did not live at home very often. He studied directing at university and directed several films during his time, all of which were well-received. Later, he had the honor of handling an international production with a famous director, which was a massive success at the box office, and he won the highest award in the film industry: Best Director at the International Film Festival.Hence, he was now an internationally famous director, and many stars were proud to be in his films. He spent almost every day on the set and was home for no more than two months a year. The month Su Yunluo lived in his apartment was the most frequent time he came home.Just as Su Yunluo liked Xu Xiangchen, Jiang Hanfei had also wanted her for a long time. He hid it well, did not let her know, and only dared to secretly look at her lovingly in places she could not see. During the month she lived in his house, that was the closest they had been. At that time, he could see her every time he went back, which taught him to be happy.However, looking at this empty house, Jiang Hanfei felt regretful. If he could have made more time to come back to see Luo Luo, perhaps she would not have been in trouble.He drank beer from bottle to bottle, and only when drunk could he feel less pain.

Let me hold you for a while.\u201d The girl saw she could not break free, so she had to let him.The man took advantage of his drunkenness to vent his long-hidden feelings. \u201cLuo Luo. I have liked you for a long time. That time you and I met. I was always bullying you. Actually just want you to pay more attention to me. Don\u2019t always look at A\u2019Chen.\u201d\u201cLater, you and A\u2019Chen got together. I feel heartbroken, but still, I wish you well. But A\u2019Chen betrayed you and caused you to be in a coma from a car accident. I really regret it, and I didn\u2019t protect you well. Sorry. I love you so much.\u201dSu Yunluo helped the drunken man to the bed. She was getting tired and sweaty. Looking at the man on the bed, Su Yunluo had an inexplicable sense of familiarity. [System, why do I feel that he is familiar? It\u2019s like we\u2019ve met before.]The system was startled and did not answer. It was good that the man in the bed moved, so Su Yunluo was too busy taking care of him to notice its silence.The next day, the man woke up from his hangover. His head was still aching a bit. He sat up from the bed and thought back to last night. He remembered being drunk, then seeing Luo Luo and saying many things to her. Then, Jiang Hanfei smiled: He must have been drunk last night. How could Luo Luo appear here when she was still lying unconscious in the hospital?Just. How did Jiang Hanfei hear movement coming from the kitchen? Jiang Hanfei was puzzled and walked towards the kitchen, only to see an incredible scene: Su Yunluo was happily humming in his kitchen, with a spoon in her hand stirring in the pot, and her body was still floating!Su Yunluo noticed and turned back to see Jiang Hanfei standing in the kitchen doorway. She was so scared that she dropped the spoon into the pot. \u201cHan. Brother Hanfei,\u201d Su Yunluo stumbled and called him.\u201cLuo Luo?\u201d Jiang Hanfei also spoke and called back to her testily.\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Su Yunluo put up a smile.Then, Su Yunluo described the matter to him. Surprisingly, Jiang Hanfei believed in such a bizarre situation without even thinking about it.\u201cBrother Hanfei, don\u2019t you even have any doubts? Just trust me like that?\u201d Su Yunluo spoke cautiously.\u201cI believe. As long as it\u2019s what you say.\u201d Jiang Hanfei did not hesitate, and his eyes were sincere.\u201cThank you for the willingness to believe me,\u201d Su Yunluo said, showing a genuine smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will help you find a way to go back.\u201dSu Yunluo just wanted to say something, but her face suddenly paled. Jiang Hanfei looked nervous, \u201cLuo Luo, what\u2019s wrong? Where are you not feeling well?\u201dSu Yunluo smiled weakly, \u201cBrother Hanfei, I\u2019m fine. Let me rest for a while.\u201dAfter a while, Su Yunluo\u2019s face finally returned to normal. Then she spoke with a troubled look, \u201cBrother Hanfei, you may not believe me, and the only person who can see me now is you. Besides, the state of my soul body is fragile now, but it will recover when I am near you. I have to follow you during this time.\u201dJiang Hanfei froze, then expressed his understanding, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can follow me during this time, and I will also care for the teacher and your mother\u2019s end.\u201d Su Yunluo looked at him with a grateful face.That night, Su Yunluo followed Jiang Hanfei to the hospital. Father Su and Mother Su were guarding the hospital bed, and when they saw him, they smiled, \u201cHanfei is here.\u201d\u201cTeacher and Ma\u2019am. I don\u2019t think you have eaten anything yet. Just now, I bought some food on the way, so let\u2019s have some.\u201d Jiang Hanfei took the rice to them.The parents wolfed a few bites and couldn\u2019t finish it. They looked at their daughter in the hospital bed, hoping she would open her eyes. Su Yunluo looked at the haggard appearance on the two old people\u2019s faces and felt heartbroken.When they returned to the apartment, the two had a difficult time with sleeping matter. Jiang Hanfei\u2019s apartment originally had three rooms: the main bedroom, the second bedroom, and the guest room. However, the second bedroom and the guest room had been converted into a study and a recreation room, leaving only one master bedroom.Jiang Hanfei originally wanted to give her the room to sleep and go to study by himself, but he saw Su Yunluo blurted out with a hesitant face, \u201cBrother Hanfei, if you don\u2019t mind, let\u2019s sleep together. The weather is also getting cooler now, and you can easily catch a cold while sleeping on the floor. I will sleep very peacefully and won\u2019t disturb you.\u201dAfter hesitating for a while, Jiang Hanfei nodded in agreement. Two people sleep in the same bed, separated by a blanket. Su Yunluo\u2019s soul body was weak, plus she was exhausted, and soon fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It turned out that there was such a thing as an out-of-body soul in this world, and it happened to the girl beside him. The only witness to this event was himself.It was a secret between them, making him somewhat secretly happy. This was the closest contact between the girl and him, and he didn\u2019t know how long this would last, but he would cherish this time.Jiang Hanfei had been back for a week. The crew was trying to catch up and kept pushing, so he had to leave. Naturally, Su Yunluo also followed him and left.After a short flight of two hours, the two arrived in X. City X was a well-known ancient capital with one of the country\u2019s most famous film and television cities, and countless classic movies and dramas were born here. This time, Jiang Hanfei was directing a large-scale costume movie here.Just as the two arrived at the shooting site, a woman in ancient costume greeted him, \u201cDirector, you are finally here.\u201d She was all smiles, and her eyes charmingly looked at him.The woman\u2019s delicate voice gave Su Yunluo goose bumps, and Jiang Hanfei frowned without a trace. \u201cHow come you\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cAigoo, director. I know you\u2019re back today, so I came here to wait for you and talk to the director about acting while I\u2019m here.\u201d The woman\u2019s words were full of suggestiveness.Jiang Hanfei looked disgusted. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for you. If you have anything to do, find the assistant director.\u201d After saying that, he took Su Yunluo and left without looking back.This woman was the fourth female in the film. The original investor insisted on shoving her in. The investor initially wanted her to be the second female, but Jiang Hanfei refused. The actress had no acting skills, and he would not let her ruin his film. If not for a few friendships with the investor, she wouldn\u2019t even get a turn as the fourth female.Jiang Hanfei took a short break at the hotel and went to the shooting site. It was Su Yunluo\u2019s first time in this kind of place. Looking at the magnificent set, she felt very shocked.This movie told the story of how a palace maid struggled to survive at the bottom, fighting and upgrading along the way and finally becoming the empress of her generation. This was a big feminist drama, and the male role was less covered. Even the male protagonist\u2019s part was small, and he could call it a day after a few scenes were shot.The movie\u2019s hero and heroine were the most well-known domestic powerhouse actors, the second and third actresses were famous stars, and the other supporting actors were selected through multiple rounds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But now that he saw her enjoying herself, he let her be and only watched the images inside the camera with single-mindedness.This scene filmed the heroine and another palace maid going to wash clothes, but they encountered something extraordinary. The female lead played the role of court lady Shen Qingyi, while the fourth female, who failed to seduce Jiang Hanfei, played another court lady, Shao Yao.(The following is the plot of the movie)\u201cPhew. Finally finished washing.\u201d Shen Qingyi rubbed her sore back and looked at the palace maid beside herself, \u201cShao Yao, let\u2019s go.\u201dThe two held a bucket of clothes and walked back to the garment station. At the sight of the palace not far away, the palace maid named Shao Yao spoke, \u201cQingyi, have you ever heard the story of this palace?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Shen Qingyi looked puzzled.Shao Yao spoke mysteriously, \u201cI heard that the owner of this palace is the late emperor\u2019s favorite Imperial Consort Hui. Imperial Consort Hui was the first beauty in the capital, proficient in qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting, and had the good fortune to see the face of heaven. The late emperor fell in love with her at first sight and immediately welcomed her into the palace.\u201d\u201cThe previous emperor doted on her very much, leaving behind the other three palaces and six courtyards, day after day, only to her palace. Later, Imperial Consort Hui became pregnant, and the previous emperor was overjoyed. Everything good was on her, which even the Empress could not compare. But unfortunately, the good times did not last long. The late Emperor suddenly fell ill and died not long after. The Crown Prince reigned, and the Empress became the Empress Dowager. The Empress Dowager hated Imperial Consort Hui and poisoned her. She ordered her abdomen cut open to get her son, and the child died.\u201cAfter that, this palace was sealed up. Only the cries of a woman were heard from time to time inside, and people in the palace said that it was the ghost of Imperial Consort Hui who was making mischief.\u201dShen Qingyi smiled helplessly, \u201cWell, this is all hearsay. Forget about it. How can there be a ghost?\u201d\u201cIt is impossible to tell. The people in the palace say so, proving that the matter is nine times out of ten. I think we should not come over here in the future.\u201d Shao Yao felt a sense of sympathy.\u201cDo not say so much. Let\u2019s go back quickly. If we are late, the housekeeper will scold us again.\u201d Shen Qingyi spoke.\u201cYes, yes, yes. Go quickly, go quickly.\u201d Shao Yao\u2019s footsteps quickened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s probably because the weather has become cooler recently.\u201d Shen Qingyi spoke.\u201cNo, there is really something wrong with this palace. Let\u2019s go.\u201d No sooner had the words left her lips when an eerie laugh came from nowhere.\u201cWhat to do? Qingyi, it must be the ghost of Imperial Consort Hui who is making a noise.\u201d Shao Yao was scared to death and got weak in the legs.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, calm down. Don\u2019t scare yourself.\u201d Shen Qingyi patted her hand to comfort her.The eerie laughter was getting louder and louder. At this time, the two saw a white shadow floating towards them not far away.Shen Qingyi was just about to say something when Shao Yao screamed: Ahhhhh!The sound was so deafening that Su Yunluo felt her eardrums tingling.Seeing that Su Yunluo was frightened, Jiang Hanfei\u2019s face immediately darkened, and the assistant director at the side also spoke angrily, \u201cStop, stop, stop! Xu Peipei, it\u2019s not your turn yet. Why are you so quick to scream? And ah, the bucket in your hand, did I tell you to put it down?\u201d\u201cSorry, director. I did not mean to, and I was just too nervous,\u201d Xu Peipei said with an innocent face.\u201cYou should apologize not only to me but also to Lu Ying Hou,\u201d the assistant director spoke.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lu Ying Hou,\u201d Xu Peipei smoothly spoke, but her expression was not so happy.The good thing about Lu was that she was known as a good-tempered person in the circle and didn\u2019t bother with her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Take your time.\u201dBut even the best temperament, in the face of Xu Pei Pei\u2019s forgetfulness and scene-stealing, all could not help but get angry.\u201cStop, stop, stop!

I won\u2019t make this mistake again.\u201dThe assistant director took a deep breath and opened his mouth, \u201cAct 8 for the fifth time, action!\u201dLu Ying Hou adjusted her state and re-entered the scene.

Su Yunluo followed Jiang Hanfei on the set for more than a month. The entire film and television studio city was visited during this period, and their feelings slowly warmed up.The night before leaving X City, the city held its Triennial Lantern Festival. So, Jiang Hanfei took Su Yunluo to see the lanterns.The location of the lantern festival was in Song Street in Film City. This old street was modeled after the life scenes of the people in the Song Dynasty, and the road was lined with various stores selling Chinese-style products. Today in this street, one look around was hung with multiple lanterns. All kinds of colorful styles were available, and they were beautiful.Su Yunluo followed Jiang Hanfei closely. She curiously looked at the spectacle in front of her. There were many people tonight, and most of them were dressed in ancient costumes. The vendors along the street were yelling loudly, and it felt like they were really in the Song Dynasty.Compared to the people here, Jiang Hanfei and herself looked a bit out of place. Wearing modern clothing and not being visible to others, Jiang Hanfei was a bit out of place.Su Yunluo looked left and right, and finally, she saw a clothing store. She pulled Jiang Hanfei, who looked puzzled and walked to the clothing store not far away.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Luo Luo?\u201d Jiang Hanfei was puzzled.\u201cBrother Hanfei, look at the people wearing ancient costumes here. You should go and change one too.\u201d Su Yunluo stood at the door and suggested.\u201cMe? I\u2019d rather not.\u201dJiang Hanfei shook his head with some resistance.\u201cBut, I really want to see you in ancient costume. Just do it for me. OK?\u201d Su Yunluo spoke in a tone that unconsciously brought a little childishness.\u201cOkay, okay. I will agree with you.\u201d Jiang Hanfei could not bear her disappointment and followed her into the store.The shopkeeper saw him, and her eyes lit up, \u201cThis gentleman, what do you need help with?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see for myself first. You go ahead and get busy.\u201d Jiang Hanfei spoke softly.The store was filled with ancient clothes of men, women, and children of different classes.Su Yunluo helped with the selection and found a set of green-colored precious brocade robes, \u201cBrother Hanfei, I think this set is quite good.\u201dJiang Hanfei\u2019s gaze looked at the collection of ancient clothes.

When Jiang Hanfei came out of the fitting room, Su Yunluo was amazed. \u201cBrother Hanfei, you look outstanding in ancient clothes there.\u201dHearing the woman\u2019s appreciation, Jiang Hanfei was very happy inside, but he didn\u2019t show it on the surface.After changing clothes, the two walked out of the store. Su Yunluo tugged on Jiang Hanfei\u2019s sleeve, and the two walked down the street, admiring all kinds of lanterns.When passing a particular place on the street, Jiang Hanfei was attracted by something on the stall and stopped in his tracks.\u201cSir, please feel free to take a look.\u201d The vendor showed a modest smile.The stall was full of things, primarily earrings, jade pearls, embroidered handkerchiefs, and other items commonly used by ancient women. Jiang Hanfei looked at a hairpin, \u201cThis hairpin.\u201dOn hearing that, the peddler told him, \u201cThis hairpin is handmade by my wife. The workmanship is fine, and the lotus flower is carved on it. It is very suitable to give to your girlfriend as a gift. Moreover, men gave it to women in ancient times as a token of love.\u201dThe more Jiang Hanfei looked at it, the more he liked it. He thought this hairpin was suitable for Su Yunluo and decided to buy it immediately. On the other hand, Su Yunluo was attracted by the stall next to her, so she ignored what Jiang Hanfei had accepted.The two continued to stroll when something seemed to happen ahead of them. Everyone surged forward, and Jiang Hanfei and Su Yunluo have accidentally swept apart.\u201cLuo Luo.\u201d Jiang Hanfei shouted loudly in anxiety.Su Yunluo was also anxious. She could see Jiang Hanfei in the crowd not far away, but there were too many people, so she was squeezed and squeezed farther and farther away. On top of that, she was stepped on several times, which hurt her. She could also feel the pain as a ghost, although only temporarily. For her, she was convinced.Su Yunluo waited for him at the door. After more than half an hour, Jiang Hanfei found her, \u201cLuo Luo. finally saw you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother Hanfei, for making you worry.\u201d Su Yunluo looked sorry.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.

This is a gift for you. You\u2019ve worked hard following me on set this time.\u201d Jiang Hanfei was afraid that Su Yunluo wouldn\u2019t accept it and made an excuse.\u201cI like it very much.

During this period, Xu Xiangchen came to see her once and did not appear again, which made Father Su and Mother Su furious.Her parents hired a caregiver to take better care of Su Yunluo, and her mother resigned from school to take turns taking care of her with the caregiver. As for Father Su, he went to work as usual. After all, he had to support the family, but when he was free, he ran to the hospital.Su Yunluo\u2019s vital signs tend to be stable, but there was no sign of waking up. So, Mother Su and the caregiver insisted on massaging her hands and feet and rubbing her body daily. Therefore, despite being thinner, Su Yunluo looked no different from an average person.\u201cMa\u2019am, how is Luo Luo\u2019s condition?\u201d As soon as Jiang Hanfei got off the plane, he rushed to the hospital.\u201cThe doctor said that Luo Luo\u2019s condition is generally stable now, but whether she can wake up or not is still an unknown.\u201d Mother Su looked a bit gloomy.\u201cMa\u2019am. You can relax. Luo Luo is so filial and knows that you and the teacher are worried about her, so she will definitely wake up.\u201d Jiang Hanfei spoke up to comfort.\u201cI hope so,\u201d Mother Su sighed.Su Yunluo looked at the haggard Mother Su and felt heartbroken. She hugged her tightly behind her back, even though Mother Su could not touch her.When the two walked to the hospital lobby, they saw Xu Xiangchen, whom they had not seen for a long time. He was in a hurry, his face looked a little impatient, and not far behind him, a woman called out to him urgently, \u201cXianchen, wait for me.\u201d That woman was none other than Bai Yunyun.Xu Xiangchen stopped, his face full of annoyance, \u201cI thought I told you not to look for me?\u201dAt that, Bai Yunyun looked aggrieved. \u201cBut, you have not come to see me for a long time, and I miss you very much. And the baby in my belly also wants to see its dad.\u201d She proudly stroked her flat belly.Bai Yunyun was pregnant? The emotions belonging to the protagonist made Su Yunluo\u2019s face a little pale. Jiang Hanfei watched, saddened, and became even angrier at the two people in front of him.Xu Xiangchen seemed to feel something and looked to his side and saw Jiang Hanfei, who had a mocking face. He walked over and opened his mouth somewhat awkwardly to say hello, \u201cHanfei.\u201dWhen Su Yunluo saw him coming, she hid behind Jiang Hanfei in disgust.

I just went to see Luo Luo,\u201d Jiang Hanfei smiled and laughed.At that word, guilt flashed across Xu Xiangchen\u2019s face. Then, Bai Yunyun, from behind, walked forward and held Xu Xiangchen\u2019s arm affectionately. \u201cLong time no see, Brother Jiang.\u201dThe first time Xu Xiangchen fell in love with her, he introduced her to his good buddies, including him.Jiang Hanfei smiled. \u201cLong time no see. I thought that sister would not come back. After all, that incident was a big deal.\u201dBai Yunyun\u2019s face stiffened for a moment. \u201cBrother is joking. I have no intention of leaving this time, and I am pregnant with Xianchen\u2019s child. Brother should come to drink our wedding wine when the time comes.\u201dNot long after leaving the country at the beginning, Bai Yunyun regretted it. She also made several boyfriends abroad. However, all those men only lusted after her beauty and did not like her. In this way, she missed Xu Xiangchen even more than she did.When she returned from her studies, she learned from an acquaintance about Xu Xiangchen\u2019s current situation and knew that he had a fianc\u00e9e and they were about to get married! Bai Yunyun was very unwilling. She secretly inquired about the fianc\u00e9e and learned it was Xu Xiangchen\u2019s teacher\u2019s daughter. Also, she had secretly observed Su Yunluo, a simple little girl and not her match. So, she was relieved.Bai Yunyun found an opportunity to appear before his eyes. She seized Xu Xiangchen\u2019s soft-heartedness and told him how hard it was for her to be abroad and that there wasn\u2019t a day she didn\u2019t miss him or something like that. As a matter of fact, Xu Xiangchen\u2019s original attitude of firmly refusing her became a little shaky. She took the opportunity to get him intoxicated, and the two of them had a sexual relationship.This scene \u201cjust happened\u201d to be seen by Su Yunluo. Su Yunluo angrily broke up with Xu Xiangchen. Bai Yunyun did not immediately force Xu Xiangchen to take responsibility but only said that she would not bother him again so that he could rest assured, and then she disappeared.Perhaps the heavens wanted to help her. Su Yunluo unexpectedly had a car accident, and she was pregnant with Xu Xiangchen\u2019s child because of that night. The person in the way could not wake up, and she had a child as a bargaining chip. It was only logical that Xu Xiangchen would choose her.Although Xu Xiangchen could not accept her for a while, she believed that with her sincerity, she would be able to impress him again. Bai Yunyun looked at Xu Xiangchen and smiled with a happy face.\u201cSure, sure, but sister should keep an eye on Xianchen.

I just didn\u2019t expect that Bai Yunyun was pregnant. It seems they are a natural pair.\u201d She spoke half-jokingly.\u201cLuo Luo, if you want to cry, don\u2019t hold it back. It will be better if you let it out.\u201d Jiang Hanfei was still a bit uneasy.Su Yunluo smiled helplessly. \u201cBrother Hanfei, I\u2019m really fine. I\u2019ve thought about it a lot during this time. Brother Xianchen has no feelings for me and treats me like a sister. It had always been my wishful thinking.\u201dJiang Hanfei saw Su Yunluo\u2019s eyebrows at peace. He finally felt relieved. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you were able to think about it.\u201dA month later, Jiang Hanfei\u2019s movie was officially released, and the name was set as \u201cThe Harem\u2019s Rise to Power.\u201d On the day the film was released, the box office exceeded 150 million, and many fans watched it because of Jiang Hanfei, an international director. The plot was intense, the special effects were full, and the actors\u2019 faces and acting skills were right on target, which was the evaluation given by most fans.After that, the box office rose all the way up, breaking 500 million yuan in three days, and breaking the 1 billion yuan mark in seven days. No other film in the same period could compete with it, and all the major social networking sites discussed the film. The fever was very high.The film\u2019s creators were invited by major TV stations to appear on the program, and the program\u2019s ratings were at an all-time high. When asked about the person they wanted to thank the most, everyone chose Jiang Hanfei.As we all know, Jiang Hanfei was very strict and had very high requirements for the actors\u2019 acting skills, and the slightest flaw was not allowed during the shooting. Even the simple act of serving tea and water could not be wrong. Therefore, after shooting Jiang Hanfei\u2019s scenes, the actors seem to have shed a layer of skin, but their acting skills have significantly improved.A particular talk show.\u201cDirector Jiang, all the actors who have appeared in your films, have become famous, and you have been called \u201cGolden Hand\u201d by the media. What do you think about this name?\u201d The host asked.\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t really approve of this name. Those actors became famous because of their hard work, and I just happened to discover them,\u201d Jiang Hanfei said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I heard that during the shooting of this drama, there was a haunting incident. What do you say about this matter?\u201d The host asked about the topic that everyone was interested in.The previous haunting incident was unintentionally told by one of the crew members. At that time, Xu Peipei sent out a statement on Weibo that she was scared with a photo of herself going to the hospital to see a psychiatrist. Therefore, it caused a wave of discussion. The media also picked up the dramatic pictures of Xu Peipei during the shooting, which confirmed the authenticity of the haunting.After that, the news of \u201cJiang Hanfei\u2019s crew is haunted\u201d became the headline for several days, and Xu Peipei became popular, but it didn\u2019t last long. Jiang Hanfei posted a lawyer\u2019s letter on Weibo, confirming that the incident was a \u201crumor\u201d and that Xu Peipei\u2019s agency was behind it. At the same time, he also posted photos of Xu Peipei\u2019s agent and media contacts.The netizens flocked to Xu Peipei\u2019s Weibo account to scold her and her agency. Xu Peipei apologized quickly, admitting that they did it for the sake of exposure and asking the public to forgive them.However, netizens did not buy it and later revealed all kinds of black information about Xu Peipei. These included stealing roles, blatantly slapping actresses on set, going to and from hotels with wealthy businessmen, etc. In no time, the image of the agency and Xu Peipei hit rock bottom, and the agency stopped the damage in time and hid Xu Peipei. So far, Xu Peipei\u2019s career was considered ruined.\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t know why there is this rumor. How can there be ghosts in this world? If there is a ghost, how come all the people present did not see it, only Miss Xu saw it? It doesn\u2019t make sense. But anyway, thanks to Miss Xu\u2019s wonderful performance in the movie.\u201d Jiang Hanfei was a bit helpless.In fact, Jiang Hanfei did not want to be so desperate. After all, Xu Peipei was initially frightened, and to compensate her, he promised to introduce her to a good role, a great opportunity many actors could not get. Unfortunately, she was greedy and even tried to use this incident to hype a wave of popularity. Jiang Hanfei hated the idea of someone using his movie to speculate, not to mention that it was about Su Yunluo, so he would not let this happen.But Xu Peipei was too arrogant and offended many people in the circle. He only made a slight movement behind the scenes, but all the black material about her was none of his business. It could only be said that people had to see the good and not get ahead of themselves. Otherwise, they would regret it.At the end of the talk show, the host asked one of the most concerning questions, \u201cMay I ask if Director Jiang has a girlfriend?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d His answer disappointed the audience, but soon he dropped a heavy bomb, \u201cbut I already have someone I like. I can\u2019t reveal it for now. I\u2019ll tell you when I have good news,\u201d he said, ending the interview.That evening, \u201cJiang has a sweetheart\u201d became the headlines of the entertainment industry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The light in the living room was on, and the TV was playing a variety show.The cold weather made Su Yunluo shrink a little in fear of getting out. Jiang Hanfei frowned and went over to pick her up. The weight in his hands was almost negligible, and the temperature was low, yet she was so tangible in his arms. The woman seemed uncomfortable, rubbing against his chest, looking for a more comfortable position. Her subconscious movements made the man\u2019s heart go soft.Jiang Hanfei had just put her on the bed when Su Yunluo woke up. \u201cMmm, you\u2019re back.\u201dThe woman\u2019s affectionate tone delighted the man. \u201cHmm, how did Luo Luo fall asleep in the living room?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go to bed early, and the TV was too boring, so I accidentally fell asleep.\u201d Su Yunluo\u2019s voice lowered as she closed her eyes and fell asleep again.Jiang Hanfei smiled dotingly and took his clothes to the bathroom to take a shower.The next day, when Su Yunluo woke up, it was already more than eight o\u2019clock. There was nothing around her, and Jiang Hanfei had gotten up long ago. When she got up and walked to the kitchen, she saw him making breakfast.Su Yunluo leaned against the kitchen door while rebuking her laziness. At the same time, she praised Jiang Hanfei in her heart: A good man in the new century who could go up to the hall and down to the kitchen.Jiang Hanfei looked back and saw Su Yunluo smiling at him. He smiled gently, \u201cAre you awake? Go sit at the dining table.\u201dSo, Su Yunluo obediently sat at the dining table. Jiang Hanfei made a Chinese breakfast, soft and delicious millet congee, delicious soup dumplings, and fragrant soy milk, packed with nutrition.Although he knew Su Yunluo couldn\u2019t eat, Jiang Hanfei still prepared a portion for two people.\u201cSo delicious,\u201d Su Yunluo \u2018tasted\u2019 one by one, speaking praise.The woman\u2019s face was bare, and her hair was messy, but Jiang Hanfei thought she looked cute and couldn\u2019t help but reach out and touch her head.Both of them froze. Jiang Hanfei reacted and coughed, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Brother Hanfei. I\u2019ll go clean up the dishes first.\u201d Su Yunluo was also a little embarrassed and stood up, but her footsteps were too fast, and she slipped. She was about to fall, but Jiang Hanfei hurriedly held her up, \u201cBe careful! \u201dSu Yunluo fell into his arms. The distance between the two was very close. Su Yunluo heard the man\u2019s violent heartbeat, breathed in the man\u2019s fresh breath, and was a little overwhelmed.Looking at the tempting red lips in front of him, Jiang Hanfei felt his mouth dry and kissed the ghost.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was only after a long time that Jiang Hanfei let her go.\u201cBrother Hanfei, what do you mean by this?\u201d Su Yunluo bit her lips and sat on his lap.Only when the tide of emotion in his body subsided did Jiang Hanfei speak, \u201cLuo Luo, I like you. Would you consider being with me?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was low and charming, and his eyes were focused on her, with apprehension written under them.The waiting time seemed to be as long as a century. Su Yunluo spoke with some hesitation, \u201cBut, don\u2019t you already have someone you like?\u201dJiang Hanfei was stunned, then reacted to what he said on the show and spoke softly, \u201cLuo Luo, the person I am talking about is you.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Su Yunluo was surprised, \u201cI thought?\u201d\u201cLuo Luo, don\u2019t doubt. I really like you. I know that Xiangchen hurt you badly, but isn\u2019t there a saying that the best way to forget someone is to start a new relationship.

Under such a high concentration of pampering, even icebergs would melt, not to mention that Su Yunluo was not an iceberg.So, Jiang Hanfei found that Su Yunluo\u2019s eyes had more and more of his shadow, and she blushed when she looked at him. This meant that Jiang Hanfei\u2019s weight in Su Yunluo\u2019s heart was getting heavier and heavier, and she would definitely fall in love with him entirely in time!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was happy because Su Yunluo was about to return to her body, and he was worried because if Su Yunluo couldn\u2019t return, how should he find her? So, Jiang Hanfei also did not go to work, and he stayed with Su Yunluo all day and was particularly nervous when the wind blew.One night, the two were sitting quietly on the sofa watching TV. Su Yunluo suddenly felt that her body was getting lighter and hurriedly spoke, \u201cBrother Hanfei, I may have to go back.\u201dJiang Hanfei looked at the person in his arms, only to see the color on her body getting lighter and lighter and finally disappearing completely from his arms!\u201cLuo Luo!\u201d He spoke in panic, yet Su Yunluo had already disappeared.Jiang Hanfei calmed down and immediately drove to the hospital.And at this moment, in the hospital ward.Mother Su was scrubbing Su Yunluo\u2019s body when she suddenly noticed that Su Yunluo\u2019s fingers moved!

When asked about the matter, Su Yunluo admitted frankly that the reason for the breakup was just that their personalities were not suitable. Moreover, she did not say anything terrible about Xu Xiangchen and finally asked the media not to bother him.Su Yunluo\u2019s attitude was very generous, and she was very clean in her private life except for this past relationship, so she won the goodwill of the people. She and Jiang Hanfei were in a relationship, and everyone could see that the two were very much in love. Plus, Jiang Hanfei\u2019s popularity was there, so no one dared to take this matter into trouble.On this day, Su Yunluo received a phone call from Xu Xiangchen.\u201cLuo Luo, it\u2019s me.\u201d Xu Xiang Chen\u2019s voice was a bit tired on the other end of the phone.During this period, the company had some problems. Xu Xiangchen was busy with business affairs, and only after watching the news did he learn that Su Yunluo and Jiang Hanfei were together.When he first learned this news, Xu Xiangchen\u2019s heart was vaguely lost. He did not expect Su Yunluo to get together with someone else so soon, and that person was also Jiang Hanfei. So, did she let go of him? Xu Xiangchen would like to ask her, but it was clear that he was no longer qualified. There was just something he still had to say to her.\u201cHmm, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Su Yunluo\u2019s voice was unspeakably cold.\u201cLuo Luo, I just want to apologize to you. I\u2019m sorry for hurting you,\u201d Xu Xianchen spoke with some difficulty.After a moment of silence, Su Yunluo spoke, \u201cBrother Xiangchen, I accept your apology, but I can\u2019t forgive you now.\u201dEven though he had prepared for this, when he really heard Su Yunluo say it, Xu Xiangchen\u2019s heart was indescribably bitter. \u201cI know. I didn\u2019t ask you to forgive me. Luo Luo, you should definitely be happy,\u201dSu Yunluo hung up the phone and sighed. Xu Xiangchen was very nice, but he wasn\u2019t a good match. It was good to make it clear like this, though.After work, Su Yunluo went to the supermarket to buy food. Jiang Hanfei found a job for Su Yunluo as an assistant in a studio, working from 9 to 5, which was very leisurely.The studio was close to Jiang Hanfei\u2019s apartment, so Su Yunluo moved in with Jiang Hanfei and lived with him. On weekends, Su Yunluo would go home.A week ago, Jiang Hanfei went away on a business trip, and today was the day he came back. So Su Yunluo decided to cook a meal to treat him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Quick Transmigration: All the Supporting Male Leads Are MineCH 60.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Jiang Hanfei returned home, it was just mealtime. Looking at Su Yunluo\u2019s back as she worked in the kitchen, the fatigue of many days of the business trip was gone. His eyes also unconsciously turned gentle.He gently walked over and hugged her from behind, \u201cLuo Luo.\u201d Jiang Hanfei bowed and printed a kiss on her cheek.\u201cYou\u2019re back. Go to your room and change your clothes. There is another dish to get before you can eat.\u201d Su Yunluo smiled and pushed him out of the kitchen.It was a simple three dishes and one soup, but it satisfied Jiang Hanfei. No matter how good he ate outside, Jiang Hanfei still preferred to eat at home.His parents divorced when he was young, and Jiang Hanfei followed his mother. Later, when his mother started a new family, he felt out of place and decided to move alone.The failure of his parents\u2019 marriage made him long for a family. But at that time, Su Yunluo and Xu Xiangchen were still together, so he thought his wish would not come true. But he never expected to get what he wanted.For him, with Su Yunluo, he could only call it home. Now that they were living together, he began to be insatiable. He hoped to use marriage to connect the two of them so that they would be regarded as complete.After dinner, the two sat in the living room watching TV. Recently, a traditional Chinese costume drama became very popular. The theme was a typical palace drama, but the plot was new and not clich\u00e9d. Plus, the actors\u2019 faces and acting skills were right where they should be, which sparked much discussion.Jiang Hanfei could look at the audience\u2019s mentality when he first looked at it. He just got into an occupational disease and unconsciously started to review the actors\u2019 performance with the director\u2019s eyes. \u201cThe male lead\u2019s emotions are not in place, not showing the kind of force.\u201dSu Yunluo laughed at him. \u201cHow can there be so many problems? I think the performance is quite good?\u201dJiang Hanfei seriously refuted her, \u201cNot good. This scene should show the emotion of sadness. The tears are there, but the hero\u2019s face does not appear sad.\u201dSu Yunluo quietly looked at him. She suddenly \u201cpfft \u201d a laugh. She found that the man would have such a childish side for the first time, arguing with her over a trivial matter.\u201cYou are making fun of me,\u201d Jiang Hanfei looked at her sullenly.\u201cNo, no, I just think you\u2019re cute.\u201d Su Yunluo was full of smiles.\u201cNo, I have to punish you for that.\u201d Jiang Hanfei jumped on her on the sofa and tickled her.\u201cGiggle, so itchy. I\u2019m wrong. You let me go,\u201d Su Yunluo blurted out, begging for mercy. Her hair became a bit messy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Quick Transmigration: All the Supporting Male Leads Are MineCH 60.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJiang Hanfei raised his hand and brushed the hair on her face to the side. He looked at the woman\u2019s cherry lips and then kissed her with a dark look in his eyes.Jiang Hanfei kissed her with a good lingering tongue kiss. When they parted, a strand of silver silk was still clinging to the corner of their mouths, which looked ambiguous.\u201cLuo Luo,\u201d the man licked the woman\u2019s slightly swollen red lips. His voice was hoarse as hell.The man\u2019s eyes were filled with a reflection of her. The fire had intensified deep in his eyes, and something in his crotch tended to raise its head. Sensing the change in his body, the woman pushed him away partly in panic. \u201cI, I\u2019m going to take a shower first.\u201dSu Yunluo lay on the bed, covered with a soft blanket. The man dropped an \u201cI\u2019ll be out soon\u201d before entering the bathroom. Now listening to the sound of water rushing in the bathroom, she panicked. Su Yunluo knew what would happen next but was inevitably a little nervous and apprehensive.The water in the bathroom stopped abruptly, then she heard footsteps slowly approaching this way. Su Yunluo turned her back to the man, pretending to be unaware of the man\u2019s movements, and closed her eyes.As usual, the man lifted the blanket and lay in, locking the woman\u2019s soft body in his arms. Then, he kissed the woman\u2019s nape. Noticing that the woman only shuddered slightly and did not refuse, the man\u2019s movements became more indulgent.The woman only felt shame as she listened to the licking and sucking sounds that were getting louder and louder behind her, and her face turned red with embarrassment like fire. The woman was wearing a silk nightgown, and through the thin fabric, she could feel the heat of the man\u2019s body. The heated palm rubbed against her waist and gradually climbed upward to grip her full roundness.\u201cMmm,\u201d Su Yunluo couldn\u2019t help but escape a sound.The man stiffened and pulled the woman\u2019s body over to face him. Su Yunluo was caught off guard, crashed into the man\u2019s fiery eyes, and somewhat shyly turned her head away.Su Yunluo bit her lips, a look that would let the gentleman Jiang Hanfei pick a way to transform into a wolf. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t bite yourself.\u201d The man freed her red lips, and his tongue covered her lips gently.At some point, the woman\u2019s clothes were removed, leaving only underwear as the last barrier.The woman\u2019s white neck was marked by him. The man held his breath as he admired the woman\u2019s chest: The two snow-white breasts were plump and upright. At the top were pink buds that trembled gently.His hands trembled as he covered the soft breasts, and their feeling gave him an incredible sensation. Jiang Hanfei gently kneaded, allowing the snow-white flesh to change into various shapes in his palm.\u201cMmmmm,\u201d the woman let an audible moan. Her nipple was licked carefully in his mouth, and her bottom couldn\u2019t help but spit out a stream of nectar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
