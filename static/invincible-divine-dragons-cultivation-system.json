The rain was so heavy that the raindrops could bounce off the floor.In the quiet school compound, one or two students were sprinting towards the dormitory under their umbrellas.Yet, a student was sitting outside of a pavilion at the side of the lake as rain fell on him without any mercy.Within seconds, he was all drenched from the rain.\u201cHeh, I\u2019m poor!\u201dThe young man stared at his reflection in the lake with a pale face. He felt a sense of bitterness when his reflection was distorted by the falling rain.\u201cWhy is God so unfair?\u201dA mocking expression surfaced on the young man\u2019s face.His name was Wang Xian. When school reopened, he would be a second-year student at the University of Rivertown. Since a young age, he stayed with his younger sister and grandmother.But his grandmother had passed away a few years ago. Wang Xian and his younger sister, Xiao Yu, were left to depend on one another.Both of them were smart students. Wang Xian had enrolled in the renowned university, University of Rivertown, with excellent grades, while his sister had gotten into the same school this year.Besides having an adorable younger sister, Wang Xian also had a like-minded female friend. Even though neither of them spelled out their relationship, they were as close as a couple.Hence, Wang Xian was satisfied with his life despite having to spend all his spare time working part-time just to earn a living for his younger sister and himself.The girl whom Wang Xian shared an intimate relationship with had been working part-time with him all along. However, she had left him for a man with a luxury car yesterday.In a cold voice, she said to him, \u201cI\u2019m sick of such a poor and miserable life. I want a brand new life now.\u201dWang Xian could still remember the scorning and disdainful sneer drawn at the lips of the luxury car guy when he left with the girl in his arms.\u201cReality and money. Heh.\u201d Wang Xian showed a scornful expression as he stared blankly at the lake in front of him. Getting drenched from the rain was nothing to him.Buzz!Wang Xian dug out his phone when he heard the buzzing sound. A faint smile surfaced on his face when he saw the message sent by his younger sister.\u201cHi everyone, I\u2019m Louis Koo. And I\u2019m Nick Cheung. Tanwan is a brand-new game that you have never tried before. Just three minutes, and you will love this game as much as I do.\u201dDrops of rain fell on the screen. As he unlocked his phone, a pop-out advertisement was playing loudly.\u201cLousy phone\u2026\u201d Wang Xian\u2019s expression was full of bitterness. The shoddy phone which he got as a gift for topping up his pre-paid card often had pop-out advertisements.He closed out of it.After he cleared the advertisement away, another one popped out again.\u201cStart the round as a dragon. At the later stages, you can roam the universe!\u201d\u201cAre you bullying me too?\u201d Wang Xian grasped his phone with force.Rumble!A clap of thunder was heard suddenly as his hands went numb.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Wang Xian felt pins and needles in his body as his expression turned apprehensive.Splash!A silvery-white thunderbolt landed in his hand without any warning. Wang Xian\u2019s body went stiff and plunged into the lake.\u201cStart the round as a dragon. At the later stages, you can roam the universe!\u201dThe advertisement continued to play on his worn-out phone. With a stiff body, Wang Xian realized that the screen was giving off lights.An image of a divine dragon appeared on his phone. It was letting out a silent bellow before it sprang out from the phone.Yes, the divine dragon sprang out unbelievably from the phone.Wang Xian saw the palm-sized divine dragon went right into his head.\u201cStart the round as a dragon.\u201dHe suddenly heard a voice in his mind. Soon after, he was shocked to see the image flashed out in his mind.Name: Wang XianRace: Human (with ability to transform into a dragon)Level: 1Dragon Energy: 1/1000Superpower: Dominate the marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animal that is lower than your own level)Devour any form of living (for extraction of dragon energy)Art of Cultivation: Divine Dragon Transformation\u201cWhat is happening? What are all these things in my head?\u201dJust as Wang Xian was astonished about what he saw in his mind, he realized he could actually breathe in the water.\u201cI can breathe and talk in the water. This\u2026\u201d With his wide-opened eyes, Wang Xian felt more comfortable in the water as compared to living on the land.\u201cWhat does \u201ctransform into a dragon\u201d means? Does that mean I can turn into a dragon?\u201d Wang Xian stared at the image in his head and murmured in shock.\u201cStart the round as a dragon. You can become a dragon.\u201d A voice suddenly echoed in his mind.Wang Xian was dumbfounded as he said unbelievably, \u201cI can become a dragon. A dragon.\u201d\u201cVoila!\u201dAt this moment, Wang Xian realized that his body seemed to undergo a massive transformation. He moved and shook his body slightly.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wang Xiang felt that he had turned into a long creature. He lowered his head and realized he had four claws. On each of the claws, there were nine toes.The claws were similar to eagle claws while the palms were like those of tigers. Fish scales were all over his body.\u201cI\u2019m really a dragon.\u201d Wang Xian stared with his eyes wide. He had horns that looked like a deer\u2019s, a head like a camel\u2019s and a pair of rabbit-like eyes. Besides that, his neck moved like a snake, and his stomach was like a clamshell. With fish-like scales, eagle claws, tiger palms and a pair of ox\u2019s ears, this is the Divine Dragon of the Chinese legends!Wang Xian slightly moved his body, and he could easily swim seven to eight meters away.\u201cA divine dragon.\u201d Wang Xian was excited. \u201cBut I\u2019m only baby size now.\u201dAs a fish swam past him, a message appeared in his head.Little Sharpbelly: Level 0Extractable Dragon Energy: 0.001Wang Xian hesitated before he moved and swam at a fast speed with his mouth open.\u201cDevour!\u201dBefore the little sharpbelly could react, it was swallowed by Wang Xian.\u201cDragon energy was increased by 0.001.\u201dA notification showed up in his head, bringing a halt to his movement.\u201cSince I can become a dragon, can I change back to my human-form again?\u201d asked Wang Xian.\u201cYes.\u201d The voice in his head sounded off.\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of dragon energy?\u201d\u201cDragon energy can be used to level up and cultivate your superpower. It can also be used to upgrade marine animals.\u201d\u201cCultivate superpower? What do you mean by upgrading the marine animals?\u201d asked Wang Xian immediately.\u201cThe divine dragons are one of the most formidable living beings in the universe. Their power comes from their dragon energy as the energy can enhance their bodies and cultivate their superpower. The Divine Dragon Transformation is all about the use of the dragon energy.\u201d\u201cDivine Dragon Transformation?\u201d Wang Xian thought of the skill that he possessed.\u201cDivine Dragon Transformation!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt this time, an imposing and mighty voice echoed in his mind.Soon after, divine dragons were circling around within his head.Among which, there was Inferno Divine Dragon with its red-hot body in flame, Frosty Divine Dragon that was covered with thick frost, and Azure Dragon which possessed unlimited vitality. There was also a dragon with a charcoal-like body that was burning in black flame, Black Dragon, and one that can sweep up a windstorm with its wings, Wind Dragon.A myriad of divine dragons circled and eventually formed three great and majestic words \u2013 Divine Dragon Transformation.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

So powerful!\u201dWang Xian was feeling the various types of divine dragon and their aura which seemed to be looking down on the rest of the world. His eyes were filled with astonishment.\u201cSo this is how Dragon Strength is used.\u201dAfter some time, Wang Xian exhaled gradually and a tinge of excitement flashed past his eyes.Art of Cultivation, Divine Dragon Transformation was the cultivation arts of the Divine Dragon. Moreover, it was also the strongest cultivation art.The methods of gathering and using Dragon Strength were within the Divine Dragon Transformation.Dragon Strength allowed him to possess Inferno Superpower, Frosty Superpower, Wind Superpower and various other types of superpowers.Based on what was explained in the Divine Dragon Transformation, Dragon Strength was the highest-tier energy. It could be transformed into lower-tier energy.Lower-tier energies referred to elements like Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and others. Dragon Strength could even strengthen one\u2019s body.Another strong ability of Dragon Strength was to upgrade marine animals.Every Divine dragon had their own Dragon Palace with crawfish soldiers and crab generals. Dragon Strength could gift ordinary marine animals the ability to evolve and gain great strength.\u201cHaha! I would never have imagined that I would have such an incredible encounter.\u201dWang Xian showed excitement on his face. After turning into the Divine dragon, the illness in his body was automatically eradicated.\u201cNow that I have become a divine dragon, I\u2019ll be able to gather the clouds and summon rain with a wave of my hand after I get stronger. I\u2019ll become the strongest existence in the entire world and build the strongest Dragon Palace.\u201dWang Xian wriggled his own body and was filled with lofty ambitions.\u201cOnce the divine dragon\u2019s body got stronger, my self-body would get stronger too. Let\u2019s start absorbing some Dragon Strength first.\u201dWang Xian thought in his heart. There are two methods to absorb Dragon Strength. One of them was to devour other living things to gather Dragon Strength. The other method would be to gather Dragon Strength based on the description of the Divine Dragon Transformation.\u201cLet\u2019s start by devouring the surrounding living things.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s eyes lit up. There was a significant amount of fish in the lake beside the pavilion. As the lake was only two to three meters deep, there weren\u2019t any large fish. Therefore, he wasn\u2019t afraid of encountering strong living things.Wang Xian wriggled his body and headed directly towards the lake.\u201cThere\u2019s a small grass carp over there.\u201dWang Xian saw a grass carp that was similar in size to him. Moving his body, he swam directly towards it.Grass Carp: Level 0Extractable Dragon Energy: 0.05\u201cDevour.\u201d Wang Xian swam over, opened his mouth and devoured the grass carp that was of similar size to him. He obtained 0.05 Dragon Energy.\u201cLet\u2019s continue.\u201dWang Zheng felt extremely excited as he moved around and started devouring the surrounding living things frantically.Grass carp, carp, lobsters and mudfish.These fish were all Level 0. Even carps that weighed three to four jin were Level 0. [1]Wang Xian\u2019s devour was extremely strong. Even if the fish was twice the size of him, the fish would shrink and directly enter his belly as he devoured one with each bite.Subsequently, he cornered all the fish to an area before devouring them in a frenzy.Heavy rain was pouring constantly and seven to eight hundred fish gathered in the middle of the lake in the school. A golden-colored body was devouring them rapidly.Growl!A weak and soft dragon roar propagated. The growl was very soft and was even softer than the sounds of the rain. However, this growl was filled with endless awe.\u201cI have gotten only twenty Dragon Energy after devouring all the fish in the lake! That\u2019s really little!\u201dAfter half an hour, the golden-colored Wang Xian swam to the edge of the lake.He looked around him and found that there was no one. Looking at his clothes at the edge of the lake, a naked Wang Xian surfaced without much thought. His eyes flashed nobleness as a dragon while his body beamed golden light.The naked body looked extremely strong and was full of muscles.\u201cI better put on my clothes quickly and get out of here.\u201d Wang Xian wasn\u2019t in the mood to admire the great changes to his body. He quickly scooped up his clothes from the lake and put them on rapidly.He also scooped up his phone at the same time and ran towards the dormitory.Bam!Wang Xian closed the door to his dormitory room with his body fully drenched. A tinge of a smile surfaced on his face.\u201cMy strength seems to be several times that of the past. My body also feels stronger than before.\u201dWang Xian clenched his fists tightly. Subsequently, he looked at his wet clothes, took them off and changed into a set of dry clothes. \u201cSo handsome!\u201dStanding in front of the mirror, Wang Xian looked at himself in an almost narcissistic way.It was the summer break and there weren\u2019t many people in the entire dormitory building and he was the only one in his dormitory room.\u201cMy level is still too low currently. I will have to practice diligently from now onwards to become a strong Divine dragon as quickly as possible.\u201dWang Xian clenched his fists tightly and took a look at his elemental attributes.Name: Wang XianRace: Human (Ability to transform into a Dragon)Level: 1Dragon Energy: 20/1000Superpower: Dominate the marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animals that are lower than your own level)Devour any form of living (For extraction of dragon energy)Art of Cultivation: Divine Dragon Transformation\u201cIt seems that 20 Dragon Energy isn\u2019t of much use, either. I\u2019ll have to reach level 2 as quickly as possible.\u201dWang Xian thought to himself.Buzz Buzz. At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly heard his phone ringing.\u201cWhat the\u2026 The phone is still working after falling into the lake?\u201dWang Xian was surprised. He walked over immediately, picked up his phone and saw a message from his sister.Unlocking the phone, there wasn\u2019t any rubbish advertisement this time.\u201cBrother, I\u2019m done with my work today and am accompanying Xiao Mi to go shopping. I earned two hundred today from tutoring! Brother, let me buy you a shirt.\u201d\u201cBrother, why aren\u2019t you replying to my message? And why aren\u2019t the calls getting through?\u201d\u2026\u201cBrother, what are you doing? Are you still working? Please reply to me immediately when you receive my messages.\u201dSeeing seven or eight messages from his own sister, a smile appeared on Wang Xian\u2019s face. He immediately replied, \u201cYour brother is busy now. Go shopping and buy whatever you want. Your brother has enough money for your school fees and you won\u2019t have to worry about the living expenses in the future.\u201d\u201cI still have a sister who will be attending the University of Rivertown with me. Let\u2019s see if I can give her a surprise before she arrives.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s heart softened at the thought of his adorable sister.\u201cNow that I can transform into a Divine dragon, what are some ways for me to earn money? Should I head to the ocean and catch some fish?\u201dWang Xian thought to himself and recalled about that girl. His eyes were filled with determination as he mumbled to himself, \u201cI must become a rich man in the future. Only when I have strength and money can I get what I want.\u201dHe had been working on temporary jobs before and could earn approximately a hundred dollars a day. For this summer vacation, he found a rather good job and earned four thousand dollars in twenty days.Currently, he had over eight thousand dollars in his hands. This was sufficient for his and his sister\u2019s school fees but wasn\u2019t enough to cover their living expenses.His sister was also sensible enough to start working during the summer vacation. She found a job as a home tutor back in their home village and could be considered as being well paidl.\u201cI will definitely not allow my sister to suffer after she enters university. I have to turn her into a little princess.\u201dWang Xian made up his mind to not allow his sister to become like him in the past where he had to work part-time while studying.Growl.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m so hungry. This is weird considering that I had devoured so many fish.\u201dAt this moment, Wang Xian felt pangs of hunger. He took his umbrella and headed out directly.Endnotes[1] 1 Jin = approximately 500 gramsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wang Xian would usually have his meals outside of school.The University of Rivertown, unlike other universities, was not situated in the desolate suburbs.The university was situated within Rivertown College Town which had three universities and three vocational schools in total.The area surrounding the University of Rivertown was extremely robust with an old street. Even though it was known as the old street, everything was new inside. It was a street that was full of buildings that were imitations from the ancient days.The old street was the most robust street within Rivertown as it gathered all the students from the six schools. With a few high-class residential areas surrounding it, many people were there even though it was summer break.However, there was not much of a crowd on the street as it was raining today.Wang Xian looked at the restaurants around him. \u201cLet\u2019s have something good today.\u201dPreviously, he was so thrifty that every meal would not cost him more than fifteen dollars. Most of the time, he would settle his meals with instant noodles.Even though Wang Xian was as broke as usual, he thought of ways to earn money with the golden opportunity he chanced upon today. So, he decided to splurge for once.Wang Xian observed the restaurants around him and fixed his gaze on a restaurant that was called First-grade Seafood Restaurant.First-grade Restaurant was the most expensive restaurant on the street. Wang Xian\u2019s roommate mentioned that two people could spend almost six to seven hundred dollars for a simple meal here.Average spending per person was about three to four hundred dollars, which was a price that he could not afford before.Yet, at the same time, this restaurant served the most delicious food on this street.\u201cThis is it.\u201d Wang Xian decided to have a sumptuous meal.\u201cWelcome.\u201d The two greeters at the door bowed welcomingly.\u201cSir, you can leave your umbrella here.\u201d The waitress on the right said to him with a crisp-clear voice.\u201cSure.\u201d Wang Xian nodded.\u201cEh?\u201d However, he revealed a surprised look on his face when he looked up to the girl.Seeing Wang Xian staring at her, the girl smiled at him politely.\u201cGuan Shuqing? She\u2019s Guan Shuqing, the hottest girl in our major.\u201d Wang Xian recovered from his state of shock. The girl who was greeting him was also a student from the same year as him.A pretty girl who was also among the top few beauties in the school \u2013 Guan Shuqing.However, they were not from the same class. Hence, she would not know a nobody like Wang Xian.Guan Shuqing had many admirers courting her in school. One of the most epic incidents was that a rich man\u2019s son drove a Ferrari with a full trunk of flowers to woo her, but was rejected.\u201cNever would I expect to see Guan Shuqing working as a part-timer during the summer break.\u201dWang Xian was thinking to himself. A pretty girl like her would gain easy access to money if she needed it, just like how she\u2026 but now\u2026\u201cBut probably, this was the reason why many people took a liking to Guan Shuqing.\u201dWang Xian shook his head. He did not care about the gossip in school, so he was unaware of her situation.\u201cSir, how many of you?\u201d A waiter walked over and asked.\u201cOne.\u201d\u201cSir, this way please.\u201dThe waiter led him into the restaurant. Wang Xian observed the crowd that was dining in the restaurant. The business here was extremely good.After getting himself seated, Wang Xian studied the dishes on the menu.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed the First-grade Restaurant. They even have twin abalones that are worth two hundred thousand dollars.\u201d Wang Xian stared at the price on the menu.Apart from the high-priced twin abalones, a portion of sashimi cost seven to eight hundred dollars and a portion of caviar cost a few thousand dollars.On top of that, an\u00a0Australia lobster of three to five jin cost two thousand dollars each.\u201cThat is simply expensive!\u201d Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He ordered a plate of oysters, two cheap dishes and a soup which cost him over two hundred dollars in total.\u201cSir, please wait for a moment. The dishes will be brought to you in no time.\u201d The good-looking waitress said with a sweet smile.\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Xian nodded. Good restaurants simply had better service. Even the waitresses are all young and beautiful.Soon, the dishes were served to him. Wang Xian began to tuck in his food excitedly. Previously, he had eaten all kinds of artificially flavored instant noodles including stew beef, tomato beef, Sichuan spicy beef, and pickled vegetables. He almost wanted to puke. Today, he could finally upgrade his meal.After a hearty meal, Wang Xian burped with satisfaction and took a few sips of tea.\u201cThe food here is really delicious. When I\u2019m rich in the future, I\u2019ll bring my sister here every day.\u201d Wang Xian told himself.\u201cExcuse me, can I have the bill?\u201dWang Xian called out and foot the bill of over two hundred dollars. A meal like this was equivalent to more than one week\u2019s worth of his meals.After footing the bill, he was about to leave with a smiling face.Bang!\u201cAh!\u201dWhen he got up, he heard something shatter and a fearful scream coming from the entrance.Wang Xian wondered for a while, but he was not bothered by it and continued on his way out.When he was at the door, he saw a fish tank that was about 1.8 meters long, three fish and some water lying on the floor.A middle-aged man was yelling anxiously, \u201cGet some water now. Hurry! It can\u2019t die. It can\u2019t die.\u201dAs he was yelling, he walked to the three fish. Two of them were fine while the remaining one was looking half-dead under the broken glass of the tank.\u201cBoss, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t see you just now.\u201d A greeter in her uniform who was standing to the side was apologizing to the boss with an ashen face.\u201cDon\u2019t apologize to me. You\u2019ll be lucky if the arowanas are fine. If anything happens to them, you can\u2019t even compensate me even if you sell yourself away.\u201d The middle-aged boss was howling at the girl with anger.The girl paled immediately with her eyes red.\u201cGosh, Mr. Li, how did this happen? Why are the three arowanas on the floor?\u201d At this time, an elder walked over with a surprised look.Mr. Li looked up at the elder and replied quickly, \u201cZhao, a young lady accidentally broke the tank when the workers were moving it.\u201d\u201cDo these three arowanas belong to Old Wang? They\u2019re worth five to six million dollars. Old Wang treated them like precious jewels. How did you borrow the fish from him?\u201d Zhao squatted down and examined the three arowanas.At the same time, the employees from the hotel fetched a huge basin of water.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao began to examine the condition of the three arowanas.The greeter at the side got even paler when she heard the old man.Wang Xian was stunned by the old man\u2019s words too. Three fish for five to six million?\u201cIf three fish are worth five to six million, each of them would have cost one to two million?\u201d Wang Xian was aghast in hearing the price. He looked towards the greeter and frowned immediately. \u201cGuan Shuqing!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He touched the body of the arowana and continued, \u201cThis red arowana probably had a worse fall when it dropped down. It probably would be\u2026\u201dZhao did not complete his sentence but it was clear what he was trying to say. This arowana might not survive for long.Mr. Li looked extremely unhappy when he heard the words of Zhao. With a heavy face, he said, \u201cI asked Old Wang to lend them to me for a few days to change the Fengshui of the shop. Who would have expected\u2026\u201dAs Mr. Li spoke, he stared at the female greeter.\u201cThese are arowanas that are worth several million. To cause their death by dropping them, you are really too careless.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The greeter probably wasn\u2019t paying attention and knocked into one of the few deliverymen who was shifting the goods. That\u2019s really careless on her part.\u201dAt this moment, the customers were gathering around the scene. They were pointing and commenting on that arowanas as they felt sorry for the incident. Some of them were even pointing at Guan Shuqing as they explained the incident to customers who had just joined the crowd.Guan Shuqing had her head lowered all along and tears were streaming down. She looked extremely pitiful at this moment.\u201cWhat are you crying for? I\u2019m the one who should be crying. A red arowana that costs one to two million is killed by you.\u201dMr. Li looked up angrily and walked in front of Guan Shuqing. His finger was pointing angrily at her head as he scolded.Guan Shuqing kept her head down and her body was shaking slightly. She raised her head slightly, revealed an expression that drew sympathy and said, \u201cMr. Li, I didn\u2019t do this on purpose. I really didn\u2019t do this on purpose.\u201d\u201cNot on purpose? Will it be fine if you just apologize after breaking something that costs one to two million? Huh? Can you afford to compensate me for it?\u201dThe angry Mr. Li grabbed and pulled Guan Shuqing\u2019s clothes. He looked rather hideous at this moment.\u201cHey hey. Mister!\u201dAt this moment, Wang Xian could no longer stand the sight of Mr. Li who seemed to be acting irrationally. \u201cThis lady didn\u2019t do this on purpose. Moreover, isn\u2019t this arowana still alive?\u201d\u201cWho is this brat? Mind your own business. If you want to interfere in this, compensate me on behalf of her!\u201dMr. Li turned around immediately and yelled at him after hearing what Wang Xian had said.Wang Xian heard Mr. Li\u2019s words and frowned slightly. He took a glance at Guan Shuqing before turning his vision towards the red arowana.Arowana: Level 0Extractable Dragon Energy: 1\u201cI could extract one Dragon Energy from it? No wonder this arowana is worth more than a million.\u201d Wang Xian thought to himself. At this moment, he recalled the applications of Dragon Energy. He looked towards Mr. Li and said, \u201cAs a man, don\u2019t make things difficult for a young lady. I\u2019m confident I can cure the arowana.\u201d\u201cYou are confident?\u201d Mr. Li looked at him in doubt.\u201cHey brother, this is a red arowana that is worth a million or two. Are you sure you could cure it?\u201d Old Zhao looked at him with suspicion.\u201cYou will know after you see it.\u201d Wang Xian didn\u2019t elaborate further and walked directly towards the red arowana. This was because he wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sure of it either.\u201cIf you are not sure, don\u2019t touch it.\u201d warned Mr. Li as he looked sternly at Wang Xian.\u201cHow would you know if you don\u2019t give it a try,\u201d replied Wang Xian without looking up. He extended his hand over and touched the fish.Mr. Li had a stern look on him but didn\u2019t try to stop him. This teenager in front of him was so confident and might be his only ray of hope.\u201cDragon Energy.\u201dWith just a thought, he injected Dragon Energy into the body of the arowana based on how he would upgrade other marine animals.Something magical happened. Wang Xian could fully sense the internal constitution of the arowana and he realized that he could make upgrades to the arowana through the Dragon Energy.\u201cTruly magical.\u201dA surprised look appeared on Wang Xian\u2019s face. He discovered that there was a little blood clot within the red arowana and it was exactly this blood clot that made it lethargic and on the brink of death.\u201cDragon Energy nourishment.\u201dGolden-colored Dragon Energy streamed passed and the blood clot within the body dissipated.He retracted the Dragon Energy and realized that he had only exhausted one point of Dragon Energy,Flap flap. At this moment, the previously half-dead red arowana was wriggling its body in the basin. It seemed to be extremely active.Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face as he swung his finger in front of the red arowana.The red arowana moved along with his finger excitedly.Wang Xian put on a front by squeezing the body of the red arowana.\u201cWow! So magical! It has recovered.\u201d\u201cFor real. The arowana looks fine and it seems to have really recovered.\u201dThe surrounding crowd looked towards Wang Xian with astonishment after seeing the red arowana swimming freely in the water.Old Zhao, who was beside him, made a detailed examination of the red arowana. He gasped with surprise and blurted, \u201cIt has really recovered!\u201d\u201cOf course there\u2019s no problem with it. It just had a little blood clot within its body previously. Just a small issue.\u201d Wang Xian stood up, cleared the dust off his hands and said to Mr. Li who was standing by the side, \u201cCome take a look. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it now.\u201dMr. Li was stunned for a moment before rushing over. He looked carefully at the red arowana.\u201cOld Zhao, is it really fine?\u201d He looked towards the old man beside him and asked with uncertainty.\u201cIt should be fine.\u201d Old Zhao nodded his head.\u201cGreat, great.\u201d Mr. Li finally heaved a sigh of relief and said, \u201cMy brother, I\u2019m really, really grateful for this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I just hope that Mr. Li will not make things difficult for the young lady.\u201d Wang Xian waved his hand.\u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t. Thank you young man. Come in. Have some food before you leave. This is my restaurant.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I just had my lunch. Your food are really delicious.\u201dWang Xian shook his head. He looked towards Guan Shuqing, who was standing on one side, and noticed that she was also looking at him.He smiled at her, bade goodbye to Mr. Li and left directly.Guan Shuqing looked at the back view of Wang Xian with gratitude. She hesitated about going up but was halted by the manager beside her.\u201cArowana, ornamental fish!\u201dWang Xian walked out of First-grade Restaurant. He opened his umbrella and sank into deep thought. The three arowana that were worth more than one, two million gave him some inspiration.\u201cPerhaps I have discovered a way to earn money quickly.\u201dThe edge of Wang Xian\u2019s mouth arched upwards as he carried his umbrella and walked forward.After walking for several hundred meters, his vision turned to a shop to his left.Aquarium shop.An aquarium shop was a place that sold fish bowls and ornamental fish.When Wang Xian walked into the shop, a middle-aged man and two young female attendants were standing in the shop. There were no other customers.\u201cHey handsome, are you looking to buy some ornamental fish?\u201d A female attendant smiled and asked this the moment he stepped in.\u201cJust browsing.\u201d Wang Xian smiled at her and replied.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright, feel free to do so.\u201d The female attendant didn\u2019t seem to be too concerned if he was interested in buying as she replied with a smile.\u201cGrass tank, sea tank and this is the ornamental fish section.\u201dThe entire aquarium shop was huge and separated into three sections of grass tank, sea tank and ornamental fish. The grass tank and sea tank sections were mainly about the background setting and had a few fish. As for the ornamental fish section, it was mainly a section that showcased various types of fishes.There were common goldfish, parrotfish and angelfish. Besides those, there were also the more expensive goldfish and koi carp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Upgrading with Dragon EnergyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5: Upgrading with Dragon EnergyLarbrestudio\u201cThe most expensive Koi carp is worth 150,000 dollars while the most expensive arowana will cost about 100,000 dollars.\u201dWang Xian was observing the ornamental fish in the aquarium store. The two most expensive fish cost only about a few hundred thousand in this shop.He looked at the fish and realized that most of them were at Level 0. Only the arowanas and the Koi carps possessed slightly more Dragon Energy.But those arowanas and the Koi carps in the fish tanks were indeed beautiful.The scales on the arowanas were glittering, and they had prominent foreheads with long whiskers.Bright and colorful patterns were all over the bodies of the Koi carps. As they swam in the tank, they looked as though they were living pieces of art.\u201cHey, pretty, your arowanas and Koi carps are quite expensive.\u201dWang Xian smiled to the salesgirl beside him as he struck up a conversation.\u201cDo you think this is expensive? You must have not seen those Koi carps and arowanas that cost millions of dollars. Our price is considered to be at the mid-range,\u201d said the salesgirl smilingly.Wang Xian listened to her reply and asked immediately, \u201cPretty, how do you differentiate a good Koi carp and arowana?\u201d\u201cRed arowanas are the most valuable breed among the arowanas while Chilli Red Arowanas are the most precious breed among red arowanas. Koi carps are more expensive, in particular, from the island countries. Those that are larger in size with bright colors are worth a few million dollars.\u201d The salesgirl explained to him smilingly.Wang Xian pondered as he nodded. He asked, \u201cIf I want to buy Koi carps and arowanas that cost a few million dollars, where can I get them in the Rivertown?\u201d\u201cKoi carps and arowanas that cost a few million dollars? You can check out the Flowers and Birds Market of the Oceantown. But a few million dollars of Koi carps and arowanas are not common. Moreover, not many people will purchase such expensive ornamental fish. Those that cost a few hundred thousand are for sale though.\u201d The pretty salesgirl continued.\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d Wang Xian nodded with a smile. He pulled out his phone and did a simple search.\u201cJust like what the salesgirl said, Koi carps and arowanas that cost a few million are uncommon and not easy to sell. But people would buy a few hundred thousand dollar ones.\u201dWang Xian ran through his thoughts. He smiled at the salesgirl and left.It\u2019s just noon. Let\u2019s check out the Flowers and Birds Market.After Wang Xian walked out of the aquarium store, he headed to the Flowers and Birds Market by cab.The Flowers and Birds Market was situated at the East Ocean district of the Rivertown, and it was not far for him.After a 20-minute drive, the car stopped at the entrance of the Flowers and Birds Market.The Flowers and Birds Market of Rivertown was a more substantial market since many wealthy people resided in Rivertown, because it was one of the top second-tier cities.Wang Xian went into the market. He followed the signs and strolled towards the fish viewing area.On the way, he saw a pet shop selling pet dogs for fifty thousand dollars.\u201cA pet dog can be kept for dozens of years, but a Koi carp or an arowana can be kept for one\u2019s entire life. There\u2019s a reason for the hefty price tag on the ornamental fish.\u201dThe Flowers and Birds Market was well-maintained with wide and clean pedestrian roads. There were stores on each side of the road.Due to the rain today, there was not much human traffic. Wang Xian went to the fish viewing area and began to skim through the individual aquarium stores.\u201cThere will be a two-day Goldfish Fair starting tomorrow. It will attract many local people and those from other cities. The exhibition will bring a large amount of human traffic. So, let\u2019s do a proper clean-up today.\u201d\u201cGoldfish Fair? Is it the exhibition jointly organized by the Jinhua Goldfish Farm, Longlian Goldfish Farm, and other large-scale goldfish farms?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The exhibition organized by these goldfish farms will attract many customers. After all, these goldfish farms are among the market\u2019s top list.\u201d\u201cI wonder what kind of goldfish they will be exhibiting tomorrow. Will there be rare goldfish like Redcap Brown Oranda?\u201d\u201cHard to say. But given the resources of those goldfish farms, there might be Redcap Brown Oranda.\u201dWhen Wang Xian walked into one of the aquarium stores, he overheard the conversation in the shop.He was stupefied for a moment. \u201cGoldfish?\u201dGoldfish was the most commonly seen ornamental fish breed. Even though they were common, rare breeds could fetch up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Redcap Brown Oranda they mentioned could sell for three to four hundred thousand dollars. It was known as the most expensive goldfish in the world.\u201cIf there is a Goldfish Fair tomorrow\u2026\u201d He raised his eyebrows and looked at some of the goldfish in the store with an idea. \u201cGive me some goldfish, Boss.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of goldfish do you want? The goldfish that I have are premier grades, incomparable to those goldfish stalls from the flea markets.\u201d The middle-aged storeowner chuckled as he spoke after hearing Wang Xian.\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Xian nodded and observed the goldfish in his store. He realized that the goldfish here were indeed costly. Some cost forty to fifty dollars each while others cost a few hundred dollars each.\u201cBoss, give me two of this, three of this and three of that.\u201d Wang Xian observed the colors on some of the goldfish as he spoke.\u201cSure. Four fifty, please. Pal, I\u2019ll give you a fishbowl for free.\u201d The store owner put up a smiling face while speaking to him.\u201cThank you.\u201d Wang Xiang smiled and handed the money to the store owner.\u201cIt\u2019s quite expensive, but I would reap profits thousandfold if I succeed.\u201dRadiance flickered in Wang Xian\u2019s eyes as he lugged eight goldfish out of the door.He took a cab and headed back to school. On the way, Wang Xian researched a lot of information on goldfish.After doing research for the entire afternoon, he realized that Koi carps had the highest value, followed by arowanas. Wang Xian wanted to improvise some arowanas for sale. But the Goldfish Fair spoiled his plan.Even though arowanas had a high value, it was more than ten times bigger in size than the goldfish. Hence, the consumption of the Dragon Energy would be high. His current level of Dragon Energy was still quite low. Besides, the value of the goldfish was not bad either.Tomorrow is the Goldfish Fair. There must be buyers. I can use my Dragon Energy to upgrade a few goldfish that are of high worth.Wang Xian thought to himself as he hugged the goldfish under the umbrella and headed towards the dormitory.The rain was still as heavy as before, and there were only a few students in the school compound.That\u2026seems to be him. As she entered the school gate, Guan Shuqing was holding onto an umbrella when she saw the figure who was pacing briskly pass her.She stared at his umbrella and the clothes he was wearing with radiance flickering in her eyes.Guan Shuqing hesitated, but she quickly caught up and called out, \u201cHey, you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Xian looked back in complete bewilderment when he heard a voice from behind.It\u2019s really him. Guan Shuqing recognized Wang Xian\u2019s face with an astonishing expression on her face.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s really you. Thank you for your help today,\u201d Guan Shuqing walked over and said gratefully.\u201cGuan Shuqing?\u201d Wang Xian was slightly stunned, but he nodded with a smile.\u201cDo you know me?\u201d asked Guan Shuqing, surprised when he called out her name.\u201cHow could I not know the renowned beauty of Class of 2020?\u201d Wang Xian looked at her and chuckled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Which department are you from?\u201dOn the small path in the school, Guan Shuqing looked at the boy with shimmering eyes.A height of 1.7 meters wasn\u2019t very tall. However, he had a unique aura around him. His determined face carried with it a tinge of stability that students didn\u2019t possess.She was full of gratitude towards the man who had helped her in the afternoon. If it wasn\u2019t for this man, she really couldn\u2019t imagine the consequences.\u201cI study Business Administration. You can call me Wang Xian,\u201d Wang Xian replied with a smile.\u201cBusiness Administration? Our classrooms are close to each other. You\u2019re not going home for the summer break either?\u201d Guan Shuqing continued, \u201cI\u2019m really thankful for your help with the incident today. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I really don\u2019t know what would have happened to me.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me for it. It was just a simple act.\u201d Wang Xian smiled before continuing, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going home this summer \u2013\u00a0found a summer job outside the school.\u201d\u201cOh really? What a coincidence! Sadly, I got fired by my boss.\u201d Guan Shuqing pouted slightly.\u201cHehe,\u201d Wang Xian looked at her and smiled, \u201cMy dormitory is right over there. Talk to you next time.\u201dWang Xian waved his hand as he spoke. All he was thinking about was the ornamental fish and making money. He didn\u2019t have the additional energy to think about chatting with a beautiful girl.Wang Xian walked away directly. This made Guan Shuqing a little shocked as she looked at his back. \u201cThen\u2026 Bye bye\u2026 You\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Wang Xian as he saw her stop suddenly despite having things to say.\u201cCan I add you on WeChat? It\u2019s all thanks to you that the incident in the day was settled. Let me buy you a meal some time,\u201d said Guan Shuqing.\u201cHmm. Alright.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head. However, he smiled bitterly after looking at the fishbowl and umbrella in his hand. \u201cMy phone is in my pocket. I\u2019ll give you my number and you can add me with that.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Guan Shuqing nodded her head. She took out her phone and added Wang Xian on WeChat.\u201cAlright, I shall not take up more time of yours. Goodbye.\u201d Guan Shuqing waved her hands at him after sending the friend request.\u201cGoodbye.\u201dWang Xian nodded his head before walking quickly in the direction of the dormitory.\u201cDid I lose my charm?\u201d Guan Shuqing touched her face as she looked at the back view of Wang Xian at a loss. \u201cIf it were any other man that had helped me, perhaps\u2026 What a unique man. Could it be that he already has a girlfriend?\u201dGuan Shuqing mumbled to herself. She hesitated for a moment before taking out her phone and sending a message to a classmate of hers that was also in Business Administration.\u201cXiao Ya, is there a guy called Wang Xian in your class?\u201d\u201cWang Xian? Yes. What\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s wooing you. That can\u2019t be. He\u2019s a pretty introverted man.\u201d After several tens of seconds, she received a reply from her classmate.\u201cIntroverted?\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at the reply messages from Xiao Ya and sank into deep thought. She replied, \u201cNo. It\u2019s just that this man really helped me out today and I would like to find out more about him. He is a little different from others.\u201d\u201cHuh? Really helped you out? Oh Goddess Shuqing, are you thinking of marrying him to show your gratitude? I know a little about Wang Xian as he is in the same dormitory as my boyfriend. From what my boyfriend told me, his family background\u2019s conditions are really bad and his sister is all he has as family. Not only has he got to work for his living expenses, he still has to raise his sister. He didn\u2019t join any group outing in his first year in school. In fact, he rarely joined his roommates in any gatherings. He\u2019s really poor.\u201d\u201cPoor?\u201d Guan Shuqing felt a little confused when she saw Xiao Ya\u2019s reply. But he went to First-grade Restaurant for lunch today!\u201cDid he have something to do at First-grade Restaurant?\u201dGuan Shuqing was confused but subsequently replied, \u201cAlright, I got it. From what you said, this man is pretty good.\u201d\u201cOh, my Goddess Shuqing, you can\u2019t be serious. You have to think thrice about it!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t read too much into it. I\u2019m focusing on my studies right now\u2026\u201dWang Xian had no clue that the it girl of the school was scooping around about him.At this moment, he was back in his dormitory. He locked the door of the room and stared excitedly at the eight goldfish in the fish tank.\u201cI wonder if the exhaustion would be huge.\u201dWang Xian scooped up one of the goldfish and thought to himself.With just a thought, he injected Dragon Energy into the body of the black and white goldfish. The breed of this goldfish was Ranchu and it had cost $120 for one. It could be considered rather expensive.He was preparing to upgrade the goldfish to the most valuable Redcap Brown Oranda. Therefore, all the goldfish that he had chosen were of similar colors to the Redcap Brown Oranda.As the Dragon Energy entered the body of the goldfish, a controlling force cruised within it.A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian\u2019s face. The Dragon race had absolute control over marine animals and Dragon Energy could even upgrade other marine animals.He picked up his phone and upgraded the goldfish according to the picture in the phone.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d Looking at the modified Redcap Brown Oranda, Wang Xian\u2019s face was filled with excitement.The Redcap Brown Oranda which was upgraded using Dragon Energy was much more beautiful than those in the picture.Moreover, it had a nobility aura around it as though the fish was from a noble race.Besides that, this Redcap Brown Oranda looked extremely lively. When compared with other Redcap Brown Oranda, this was definitely one of the highest tiers.\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful. However, upgrading one Redcap Brown Oranda would exhaust two points of Dragon Energy. This exhaustion is a but high. If I am to upgrade larger size fish like arowana and koi carps, it would probably take twenty to thirty Dragon Energy.\u201dWang Xian frowned slightly. He had only gained twenty points of Dragon Energy after devouring thousands of jin of fish in the entire lake of the school. After helping Guan Shuqing in the afternoon, he was only left with nineteen points.\u201cLet\u2019s make some money first. I can gather Dragon Energy by devouring fish in the lake or oceans. Besides that, I can also gather it through cultivation practice.\u201dWang Xian thought to himself. Money was still very important to him.He continued his upgrades using Dragon Energy. Soon, several Redcap Brown Orandas were created.Looking at the lively and nimble Redcap Brown Orandas in the fishbowl, excitement filled his face.\u201cEight goldfish! If we go by the current market price, these would be worth more than two million.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s eyes lit up. If he could really get two million, he wouldn\u2019t have to work part-time in the future. He would also be able to allow his sister to truly enjoy her university life.Name: Wang XianRace: Human (Ability to transform into a Dragon)Level: 1Dragon Energy: 3/1000Superpower: Dominate the marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animals that are lower than your own level)Devour any form of living (For extraction of dragon energy)Art of Cultivation: Divine Dragon Transformation\u201cI have exhausted 16 points of Dragon Energy and can clearly feel that I have been weakened.

After earning some money, I\u2019ll head out to the sea.\u201dAs Wang Xian wondered to himself, he washed himself up swiftly.\u201cI\u2019ll ride Dahai\u2019s scooter over.\u201d After some thought, he picked up the keys that Dahai had passed to him before the summer break.Wang Dahai was the best friend of Wang Xian. They were quite close, likely because they shared the same last name.Wang Dahai was a local. Knowing that Wang Xian was poor, he often took care of him. The funniest thing was that Wang Dahai offered to bring Wang Xian to one of those sauna cover brothels after knowing he was still a virgin.Eventually, Wang Xian turned him down speechlessly. Wang Dahai was slightly plump and lazy. Other students bought bicycles for themselves, but he said he was too lazy to paddle. So, he bought a scooter.Wang Xian hugged the fish bowl down the stairs.The rain had already stopped with the sun shining brightly. The summer air after the storm was refreshing.Wang Xian came to the carpark and started the engine of Wang Dahai\u2019s scooter.His scooter was slightly more massive as compared to the AIMA scooters. A stout person like Wang Dahai could ride this scooter comfortably.Wang Xian placed the fishbowl on the leg rest and drove to the Flowers and Birds Market.I hope I can sell all of them.Wang Xian grinned.Throughout the 30-minute journey from his school to the Flowers and Birds Market, his ride was smooth and steady as he was trying to prevent the fishbowl from toppling.Almost there. Wang Xian checked the location in front of him and noticed the massive crowd at the Flowers and Birds Market. He also spotted a lot of cars with non-local car plates driving in slowly.\u201cLooks like many people are coming for the Goldfish Fair.\u201dWang Xian sped up a little as he drove towards the carpark of the Flowers and Birds Market through a side lane.Vroom!Vroom!Suddenly, he heard a vroom coming from behind. Soon after, Wang Xian saw a few heavy-duty motorcycles dashing in from the junction at a speed not less than 80 km per hour.Wang Xian then noticed four heavy-duty motorcycles were charging towards him at a fast speed.Vroom!\u201cHaha. Sorry, I\u2019m first!\u201dAt this time, a heavy-duty motorcycle at the forefront braked swiftly, and the bike stopped steadily. The cyclist laughed out loud as he took off his helmet.The rest of the motorcycles behind braked and stopped quickly too.\u201cOh no.\u201dOne of the bikes did not manage to brake and skidded suddenly.The road was still wet after a day of rain. Hence, the bike hurtled in Wang Xian\u2019s direction.Wang Xian was slightly appalled. He quickly dodged to the side when the bike came crashing in.Bang!The scooter that he was sitting on was sent flying back for three to four meters. After the motorcycle hit the scooter, it stopped.\u201cDamm, the bike actually skidded!\u201dA young man on the bike took off his helmet and spoke embarrassed.He got down off his motorcycle and checked out the front of his bike. Upon seeing there was not much damage, he heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cLuckily, the bike is intact!\u201dWang Xian pulled a long face when the young man ignored the scooter that he hit and examined his own motorcycle the moment he got down from his bike.If Wang Xian was not strengthened by the Dragon Energy, he might not have dodged the hit in time.\u201cOh no, my goldfish.\u201dWang Xian hurried over, and his face was even longer when he saw the broken fish bowl.The fishbowl was shattered, and all eight of the Redcap Brown Orandas were struggling on the ground.Two of them were crushed under the wheels and had died immediately.Another four of them were half-dead. Seeing the shedding fish scales, the fish must have fallen and knocked themselves.Wang Xian sulked as he looked at the young man who behaved as if nothing had happened. With a darkened expression, he walked over, \u201cHow could you drive like that? And don\u2019t you have to check my scooter after knocking it down?\u201d\u201cHur?\u201d The young man turned to the scooter that was lying on the floor as soon as he heard Wang Xian.\u201cOkay, lad. I\u2019m sorry. How much is your scooter? Tell me. I\u2019ll compensate you,\u201d said the young man with a smile as he paid no serious attention to the scooter.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You didn\u2019t knock someone down, did you?\u201d At the same time, those juveniles who were also on motorcycles came from behind and checked on the young man.\u201cNothing. Just a scooter. Heh, seriously\u2026the quality of this custom-made Harley-Davidson was no joke.\u201d The young man replied laughingly as he turned around.Wang Xian stared coldly at the young man who did not care about anything. He went straight to the young man,\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you going to compensate me for the things you damaged?\u201d\u201cHur?\u201d The young man looked at Wang Xian and smiled, \u201cOf course, I will. It\u2019s just a scooter, isn\u2019t it? Tell me how much it is.\u201d\u201cHeh, not only the scooter. My goldfish, too.\u201d Wang Xian replied nonchalantly.\u201cGoldfish? Haha, there were goldfish, too? Just name the price.\u201dUpon hearing it, the young man laughed and took out about five to six bills from his wallet.As he spoke, he dug all his money out from it, \u201cHere\u2019s about six thousand dollars. This should be enough. Get going.\u201d\u201cSix thousand?\u201d Wang Xian looked at the money in his hands with a mocking expression, \u201cYou can\u2019t even buy a fishtail with that amount.\u201d\u201cLad, are you trying to extort?\u201d The young man asked coldly as he turned and glared at him.\u201cWhat? Are you trying to put the bite on us?\u201d The three juveniles walked over at this time as they glared at Wang Xian scornfully.Some of the people at the entrance of the Flowers and Birds Market crowded over with curiosity when they saw the accident.\u201cLad, you don\u2019t need to stare at me. Six thousand dollars is more than enough to cover that rundown scooter of yours and those pathetic goldfish,\u201d the young man said as he peered at Wang Xian who was staring at him. He pointed at him with much displeasure. \u201cTake the money while you can. Otherwise, you\u2019ll not get a single cent.\u201d\u201cSeems like the young man who rode the heavy-duty motorcycle accidentally knocked into the young lad on scooter.\u201d\u201cIs he alright? If he is alright, six thousand is not a small sum.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes, he\u2019s alright. But, that fellow seems discontented. Those few people who were riding the motorcycles were going too fast. The engines were roaring loudly just now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a Harley-Davidson. That motorcycle is so cool. It must have cost a bomb.\u201dAt this time, the surrounding spectators were whispering as they watched the group.\u201cTrying to send me off with a mere six thousand dollars?\u201d Wang Xian sneered at the young man. He turned to his scooter and picked up the Redcap Brown Orandas.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he had apologized the moment he alighted, Wang Xian might not have been too calculative with him. After all, all he had to do was to exhaust another sixteen points of Dragon Energy.However, he was so arrogant and Wang Xian naturally wouldn\u2019t just let it go. What he didn\u2019t know at this moment was that he was gradually gaining the imperious nature of a divine dragon. \u201cBrat, you must be trying to make a fuss out of this. How much could your thrashed motorcycle costs? How much do your petty goldfish cost? I\u2019ll compensate you for them. Don\u2019t try to get more out of this.\u201d The young man walked over and spoke coldly when he saw Wang Xian take out his mobile phone.\u201cHey brat, are you looking for trouble?\u201d Several young men behind him walked over and surrounded Wang Xian in all four directions.\u201cHey, don\u2019t be so rash guys. Let\u2019s talk this over.\u201d An old man at the side saw the commotion, walked over and shouted out of goodwill. \u201cSon, look at what you\u2019ve lost. These young men aren\u2019t being unreasonable. They would compensate you the right amount. Don\u2019t be greedy.\u201dWang Xian took a glance at the old man before turning his vision to the four young men around him.I don\u2019t need you guys to compensate me for the damaged motorcycle, but my goldfish\u2026\u201d Wang Xian paused, placing his eight Redcap Brown Orandas on the floor. He looked at them coldly before remarking, \u201cYou have to compensate me for my goldfish. There\u2019s a total of eight Redcap Brown Oranda. As for the value of each fish, you guys can look it up online yourself.\u201d\u201cWhat bullshit Redcap Brown Oranda are you saying? Hey arrogant brat, don\u2019t spout nonsense in front of me. Let me tell you this. Don\u2019t even dream of getting a cent today.\u201d The young man pointed and spoke coldly after seeing how Wang Xian had acted.\u201cWhat? Redcap Brown Oranda?\u201d However, the old man who was trying to play the mediator was shocked. He looked at the goldfish beside Wang Xian and ran over immediately.\u201cThese are really Redcap Brown Oranda. They are real!\u201d exclaimed the old man as he saw the goldfish in the broken fishbowl after running over. He squatted down, feeling a little heartache before shouting, \u201cThese are premium Redcap Brown Oranda! These two fish should be fine. Hey guys, hurry over and take care of them!\u201d\u201cRedcap Brown Oranda\u2026 Are those really Redcap Brown Oranda?\u201d Several old men standing behind the crowd exclaimed as they walked over in shock.\u201cThese are really Redcap Brown Oranda. They are the nobles among the goldfish. What a shame that two of them were crushed to death directly.\u201d\u201cLooking at the condition of these fish, they could even be considered to be among the best of the Redcap Brown Oranda. Each one of them would be worth at least $300k-400k.\u201dSome citizens exclaimed and shook their heads when they walked over and saw the goldfish on the ground.\u201c$300k-400k.\u201d The group of young men, who were standing at a side, heard what the old man and the others said. They were completely shocked as they looked at the goldfish on the floor with disbelief.\u201cThese\u2026 These goldfish are worth $300k-400k?\u201d they asked in shock.\u201cNot these.\u201d The old man lifted his head and said to the group of young men, \u201cEach of them is worth $300k-400k. Look at their appearances, they wouldn\u2019t be cheaper than $350k.\u201d\u201cThese two fish are crushed to death directly and the scales of these four are damaged. Six fish would cost no less than two million dollars,\u201d an old man replied. \u201cRedcap Brown Oranda are extremely hard to breed. Now that there are eight of them appearing at the same time\u2026 What a misfortune for them to\u2026\u201dAs the middle-aged man spoke, he shook his head constantly.More and more citizens were crowding over. They were all here for the goldfish fair today and were goldfish lovers. Naturally, they were able to recognize the nobles of the goldfish breed, Redcap Brown Oranda.As the young men heard the sigh of the crowd, their jaws dropped.Wang Xian looked at the young man and said coldly, \u201cI believe it would be best to let the police handle this incident.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t get away with less than two million dollars. There\u2019s a goldfish fair at the Flowers and Birds Market today. It would be easy to assess the losses once the professionals are here to do an assessment.\u201d The old man shook his head and continued, \u201cHey son, you should have been more careful when you were riding. What a shame that these goldfish were\u2026\u201dThe young man opened his mouth in disbelief. The other young men behind him were also standing there in shock.They would have never expected that the goldfish that they had killed would be worth two million dollars.When the young man saw Wang Xian took out his mobile phone, his face turned black.This incident was entirely his fault, and there would be no doubt that the final verdict would be that he had to compensate at least two million dollars.However, how was he going to take out that amount of money?If the Old Master in his house was to know of this incident, it would be an even greater disaster. [1]\u201cHey brother, please don\u2019t call the police.\u201d The expressions on the young man\u2019s face changed rapidly as he spoke to Wang Xian in a hurry.\u201cI\u2019m fine with not calling the police but you have to compensate me,\u201d Wang Xian replied, looking at him coldly.\u201cI\u2026\u201d The young man looked at the group of young men with embarrassment.\u201cShan He, the best we could do is forty, fifty hundred thousand dollars. You should also know that\u2026\u201d The group of young men behind him had helpless looks on them as they continued, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask your\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d The young man shook his head immediately. He definitely couldn\u2019t let his family know about it. He looked at Wang Xian, gritted his teeth and said, \u201cBrother, why don\u2019t I compensate you with my heavy-duty motorcycle?\u201d\u201cHeavy-duty motorcycle?\u201d Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and turned his sight to the imperious-looking motorcycle at the side.\u201cMy heavy-duty motorcycle was custom made recently and is worth $1.53 million,\u201d the young man said reluctantly.\u201cA heavy-duty motorcycle that costs $1.53 million?\u201d Wang Xian frowned and doubted his claim.\u201cYou can check it out on the official website. Moreover, I have records of my order here.\u201d The young man took out his mobile phone and opened up the record. \u201cThis heavy-duty motorcycle is an exclusive custom-made version of Electra Glide. The total cost of it was $1.53 million.\u201d\u201cEven if it is $1.53 million, it\u2019s still not enough. Moreover, this is a second-hand heavy-duty motorcycle.\u201d Wang Xian said sarcastically, \u201cIf we just take the value of 6 Redcap Brown Oranda, the value would at least be $2.2 \u2013 $2.3 million.\u201dThe young man was embarrassed at the words of Wang Xian. He walked over to the small trunk of the Harley heavy-duty motorcycle and retrieved a box.\u201cI\u2019ll include this pair of shoes.\u201d The young man opened the box and revealed a pair of shoes. \u201cNike MAG \u2013 Back to the Future 2. There\u2019s only a limited 81 pairs in the whole world, and each pair is worth approximately $70k.\u201dWang Xian was slightly shocked as he looked at this pair of shoes in disbelief.\u201cShan He had bought these shoes to show off to others. Now\u2026\u201d The other young men couldn\u2019t help but feel their mouths twitching. \u201cThis accident alone has pushed him back to the time before he became free.\u201dWang Xian frowned. No matter how great a $1.5 million heavy-duty motorcycle or a $700k pair of shoes were, they weren\u2019t as great as money.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou could sell the heavy-duty motorcycle away and there wouldn\u2019t be a lack of buyers for this pair of shoes.\u201d The young man said reluctantly. \u201cIf you want cash, I don\u2019t have it. Moreover, your goldfish were worth two million dollars,\u00a0just like the worth of my items added together.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head, but he was clearly not very pleased.Endnote[1] Old Master usually refers to the eldest or the one in charge of the family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - The Damm Motorcycle and the ShoesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9: The Damm Motorcycle and the ShoesLarbrestudio\u201cThis damn motorcycle and shoes.\u201dWang Xian came out from the vehicle administrative office with a darkened expression as he looked at the Harley motorcycle and the pair of shoes.The young man was acting like a scoundrel. He, too, took out two million dollars worth of goods as compensation since the goldfish were worth over two million. A Harley motorcycle and a pair of shoes made up the sum quite nicely.\u201cBut there is one good thing. Judging from the reactions from the Flowers and Birds Market, I should be able to sell away all my goldfish.\u201dWang Xian mumbled.The crowd began to multiply when the people around them found out about the Redcap Brown Orandas that were crushed under the wheels.At that time, someone expressed an interest in buying them, but he was afraid that the remaining fish would have implications after the accident. Hence, he did not dare to complete the purchase.Subsequently, Wang Xian followed the young man to the vehicle administrative office to transfer the ownership of the Harley motorcycle. At the same time, the young man got him a heavy-duty motorcycle license through some ties.\u201cThis motorcycle\u2026\u201dWang Xian gazed for a short while before he rode on it.He knew how to ride a motorcycle, but this motorcycle was too high-class for him. Wang Xian started the engine and headed back to school with much caution.\u201cThis is way too fast.\u201dWang Xian pressed gently on the accelerator, and the motorcycle simply dashed out.Just now, he tried to find out more about this Harley motorcycle.In general, most of the heavy-duty motorcycles were worth about a few hundred thousand. One of their unique features was the ability to get modified and custom-made.A custom-made Harley that cost 1.5 million dollars was possible.The most unique feature for Harley motorcycles was that they were cool and extremely flashy. Any men who rode on one would be full of charisma.Besides, Harley motorcycles made their appearances in many U.S blockbuster movies.Wang Xian could sense the curious gazes from the pedestrian when he rode the bike on the street.Gosh, this Harvey motorcycle is still far from a sports car.Wang Xian complained to himself. After all, sports cars could act as shields for the drivers and passengers whereas the heavy-duty motorcycles worked the other way around. If he were to be thrown off the bike, he would sustain serious injuries.For a first-timer in riding such a heavy-duty motorcycle, Wang Xian was riding it slowly as he valued his life very much.However, he was in a light-hearted mood today as he had found a way to earn money.\u201cShan He, you gave that lad your favorite vehicle you just bought and your flashy shoes. There goes almost everything you\u2019ve been saving up for when you were studying overseas,\u201d said a juvenile to Shan He, who had a gloomy look on his face at the entrance of the vehicle administrative office.\u201cWhat else could I do?\u201d the young man, Shan He, replied despondently.\u201cEh, that\u2019s true.\u201d The rest of the juveniles looked at him pitifully. Shan He\u2019s family was known to be strict in their discipline. His father could not tolerate any mistakes. Back then, Shan He got into some trouble, and his father kicked him out of the country for three years. Finally, he made it back. If he got into trouble again, he would be sent away again.\u201cI should call my sister and ask her to come, and she doesn\u2019t need to work part-time anymore.\u201d After Wang Xian parked his bike behind the dormitory, he brought his shoes back to his room cheerfully.With the ability to earn a living, his younger sister didn\u2019t need to work anymore.Wang Xian entered his room and hurled the pair of shoes onto his bed. He took out his phone and called his younger sister.\u201cXiao Yu.\u201d\u201cBrother, what\u2019s up? I\u2019m tutoring Nannan.\u201d Xiao Yu\u2019s voice came from the phone.\u201cLet me tell you this. You don\u2019t have to work part-time anymore. Come to me. I have earned some money that is enough for our living expenses.\u201d Wang Xian chuckled as he spoke.\u201cNo way, Brother. Nannan\u2019s parents just gave me my wage in advance today. Besides, tutoring Nannan is a relaxing task. On top of that, Xiao Mi and I had plans to go to Rivertown together.\u201d His younger sister, Xiao Yu, continued to speak on the phone.Wang Xian knit his eyebrow slightly. Xiao Mi was the best friend of Xiao Yu, and Xiao Yu was staying at Xiao Mi\u2019s place now. Both of them were enrolled at the University of Rivertown.\u201cAlright, I will send you some money, so you don\u2019t have to be frugal. I\u2019ll give you a surprise when you come to school,\u201d said Wang Xian after pondering.\u201cBrother, you don\u2019t have to. I still have $5,000 with me. I won\u2019t have a chance to use yours. Alright, I need to explain a question to Nannan now.\u201d\u201cDo-do!\u201d\u201cThis girl.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head and laughed, \u201cWhen you are here, I\u2019ll prepare a great present for you.\u201dWang Xian chuckled as he made up his mind.If it weren\u2019t for that young man, I could have earned another two million. Two million!Radiance flashed in Wang Xian\u2019s eyes as he gathered his thoughts. He decided to sell some Redcap Brown Oranda tomorrow again.At most, I can only sell the fish one more time tomorrow. Otherwise, someone will sense something amiss if it becomes too frequent.Wang Xian was thinking that it would be fine if he did it just once or twice. However, he would definitely attract unwanted attention if it continued. He would get into trouble if he lured the attention of some crooks.Wang Xian was still a meticulous man.\u201cContinue with the cultivation.\u201dWang Xian crossed his legs on his bed and began to practice his Divine Dragon Transformation.He could earn a few million dollars with just a dozen points of Dragon Energy. Because of Divine Dragon Transformation and the ability to turn into a Divine Dragon, Wang Xian was full of confidence for his future.In the future, he would not have to worry even for a little sum of money, and he could pursue a better life.Another night of cultivation passed. When he woke up, he read his profile.Name: Wang XianRace: Human (Ability to transform into a dragon)Level: 1Dragon Energy: 47/1000Superpower: Dominate the marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animals that are lower than your own level)Devour any form of living (For extraction of dragon energy)Art of Cultivation: Divine Dragon Transformation\u201cOver forty points of Dragon Energy. I feel my strength growing stronger.\u201dWang Xian sensed the change in his body and smiled. Given the past, his current condition could win a fight against seven or eight of himself.I shall go and get some goldfish first.Wang Xian gave a thought and looked at the pair of shoes on the bed. I better find some time to sell this away. A $700k worth pair of shoes is just too\u2026After he stepped out from the dormitory, he stood in front of the Harley motorcycle with the keys in his hand. The corner of the lips was slightly drawn.\u201cThis bike is just awesome. If I ride on this after the school reopens, it will be way too cool.\u201dWang Xiang grinned as he rode on the bike and headed towards the old street.I shall grab some breakfast first.He walked into a decent breakfast shop and made his way to the same aquarium shop after his breakfast.\u201cI\u2019ll get three goldfish and an Arowana.\u201dWang Xian thought of upgrading an Arowana to a premium Arowana to earn his last fortune.The Arowana cost three thousand dollars while the goldfish was only fifty dollars.Wang Xian went back to his dormitory again to upgrade the four ornamental fish he\u2019d just bought.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPremium Chilli Red Arowana. Mine would not lose out to that Chilli Red Arowana that was sold for three million online!\u201dWang Xian looked at the Chilli Red Arowana in the fish tank with brightness in his eyes. The bright redfish was giving off a classy radiance.If he could sell this fish away, he would not crack his brain for money anymore and could concentrate on cultivating his Dragon Energy.So that he could become the Divine Dragon that could roam the universe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had a styrofoam box tied around his body as he rode towards the location of the Flowers and Birds Market.To prevent the incident of yesterday from happening again, he had made the effort to find a solid styrofoam box for today and ensure that the five goldfish and the Arowana were well preserved.While cruising down the road with his helmet on, there was an indescribable extreme pleasure.However, Wang Xian didn\u2019t ride too fast and simply maintained a speed of approximately 60 km/hour.It was indeed more satisfying to ride on a heavy-duty motorcycle that cost over $1.5 million than Wang Dahai\u2019s motorcycle.\u201cOh poor Dahai. I dumped his motorcycle near the Flowers and Birds Market yesterday and it\u2019s probably gone by now. However, I\u2019ll let you ride my Harley when school reopens.\u201dWang Xian thought to himself. He could already imagine the exhilarated expression on Wang Dahai when he saw his Harley.The speed of the heavy-duty motorcycle was much faster than taking a taxi. After approximately ten minutes, Wang Xian had reached the entrance to the Flowers and Birds Market.Under the shocked looks of the security personnel, Wang Xian parked his Harley in the carpark before carrying the styrofoam box and walking into the market.\u201cThe number of people today is substantially less than yesterday.\u201dWang Xian looked at the people in the Flowers and Birds Market and saw the directional signboard prompting where the goldfish fair would be held. He immediately headed towards it.The goldfish fair was to be held in the center of the Flowers and Birds Market. After entering the place, Wang Xian noticed that there were several hundreds of people around.At that place, there were some advertisement signboards that gave introductions about the various goldfish farms and the goldfish on display.Wang Xian walked further in and saw a row of fishbowls placed neatly on the table. Within the fishbowls, there were all kinds of goldfish that were extremely beautiful.At the center of the table, there were two larger size fishbowls. Within these fishbowls, there were only 2-3 goldfish.Wang Xian saw that there were 2 Redcap Brown Oranda in them. He looked towards the price tag at the side which showed $430k.\u201cCalm down. Seems like I made a huge loss yesterday.\u201dWang Xian was clearly displeased after seeing the price. He looked around him and saw goldfish that ranged from $40k-$50k and also some that ranged between $10k-$20k.He looked around for a while before heading to the service counter of the organizer.At this moment, there were four, five people sitting in front of the reception. Among them, there were some middle-aged and old men and also a young beautiful attendant.\u201cHey, pretty, I would like to ask\u2026what should I do if I wish to display my goldfish for sale in this place?\u201d Wang Xian asked the service attendant.\u201cHuh? What? You would like to display and sell your goldfish?\u201d The service attendant looked at him with a little disbelief and noticed that he was carrying a styrofoam box in his arms.\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head.\u201cIf you would like to display your goldfish for the goldfish fair to sell them, you would need to provide the fish farm quality certification as proof. All the participating fish farms for our fair are successful goldfish breeding farms. Secondly, you need to have valuable goldfish. If you can meet the criteria, we would be happy to arrange a spot for you. However, we would be collecting some commission if you complete any transaction.\u201d The beautiful service attendant smiled at him and replied.Wang Xian frowned slightly upon hearing her explanation. \u201cI can provide great goldfish. However, with regard to the fish farm quality certification\u2026\u201d\u201cUnqualified goldfish breeding farms are not accepted in our goldfish fair.\u201dBefore Wang Xian could complete his sentence, a middle-aged man, who was lying on a chair, rejected him directly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d The service attendant smiled apologetically after hearing what the middle-aged man had said.Wang Xian frowned slightly, nodded his head and headed out.\u201cA young man carrying a styrofoam box here to ask for an exhibition spot\u2026 This is clearly the boss of a small goldfish shop wishing to attract some attention to sell his goldfish. You don\u2019t have to pay attention to people like him.\u201d\u201cAlright, Director Zhao.\u201dWang Xian vaguely heard the voice as he left the place. All he could do was to shake his head silently.\u201cForget it. Since Redcap Brown Oranda is so famous, I don\u2019t necessarily have to rely on your fair to sell them.\u201dWang Xian carried the large styrofoam box and headed out. He stopped at the entrance and looked around him.\u201cShould I just set up a stand here to sell?\u201dWang Xian thought about it. The human traffic flow of this place was great since anyone who wished to enter the fair would have to pass by this place.Moreover, he was just going to place a box right here. He wouldn\u2019t be obstructing anyone.Wang Xian smiled and placed the box down by the road. After which, he opened up the cover of the box.One blood-red colored Arowana and five Redcap Brown Oranda were revealed in the box.Six fish in one box was a little cramped but they were very lively and swam constantly.Through modification using Dragon Energy, their vitality was much stronger than ordinary fish.Wang Xian squatted at that spot while looking at the pedestrians who were walking around.\u201cHmm?\u201dPerhaps it was because Wang Xian looked a little rustic with a large styrofoam box beside him and the fact that the pedestrian couldn\u2019t see the Arowana and goldfish within it, there wasn\u2019t any pedestrian who walked over.\u201cCough cough.\u201dWang Xian coughed out loud and shouted towards the pedestrian, \u201cTop grade Arowana and goldfish for sale. Come and take a look.\u201dSome pedestrians were a little curious when they saw a teenager setting up a store by the roads. After seeing the huge styrofoam box beside him, they couldn\u2019t help but feel a little suspicious.\u201cLet\u2019s go and take a look at what kind of goldfish he has.\u201dAt this moment, a beautiful lady, who had her hands around a young man, looked over with curiosity as she said to the young man.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to see here? There couldn\u2019t possibly be any good goldfish here. Let\u2019s head over to the fish fair to buy.\u201d The young man replied impatiently.\u201cLet\u2019s just go and take a look.\u201d That beautiful girl said and pulled the arm of the young man flirtatiously.\u201cWhat a drag. What kind of good goldfish could a roadside stall have in an ugly styrofoam box?\u201d The young man remarked impatiently and had reluctance written all over his face as he walked over.\u201cWow, so beautiful. Is this an Arowana? And these goldfish are simply too beautiful!\u201d exclaimed that beautiful girl as she squatted down with exhilaration.\u201cNo need to make such a fuss,\u201d said the man without squatting down, nor did he care to shoot a look at inside the box. \u201cAll the goldfish at the fair will be beautiful and of valuable breeds. Ok, now, let\u2019s go. It\u2019s not graceful squatting on the street.\u201d\u201cBut I feel that the goldfish here are so beautiful!\u201d The beautiful girl was clearly not an expert in this field. She continued, \u201cAnd this Arowana is truly too beautiful. I really like it! I want to buy it, I want to buy it!\u201d\u201cIf you like them, just buy them.\u201d The young man took out his wallet directly and acted generously as he said, \u201cHey kid, how much do the fish in your styrofoam box cost? I\u2019ll take them all.\u201dWang Xian lifted his head and was a little shocked after seeing the wallet of that young man. There were approximately a few thousand dollars in it.This made him feel speechless.\u201cWhat? Say something, man. How much do they cost in total?\u201d The young man looked at Wang Xian and remarked impatiently.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wang Xian looked at him and replied, \u201cIf you have five million dollars on your card, we could go to a bank and do a transfer.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s words shocked the young man. He frowned, stared at Wang Xian angrily and said, \u201cHey kid, what kind of nonsense are you sputtering? I\u2019m asking you how much the fish in this broken styrofoam box cost.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sputtering nonsense. I\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u201dWang Xian revealed a smile when he noticed his conversation with the young man drew some curious customers over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did you just say that I can\u2019t afford it?\u201d The young man peered at him. Scornfully, he held up the car keys in his hand, \u201cDid you say that I can\u2019t afford it?\u201dWang Xian looked at the BMW car keys in his hand. Probably a 5 Series that was worth about five to six hundred thousand dollars.\u201cWhat kind of goldfish are they? Why are they in a styrofoam box?\u201d A middle-aged man came over with curiosity when he overheard their conversations.Another old man popped his head over from the side.Wang Xian grinned at the middle-aged man, \u201cA premium Chilli Red Arowana and five Redcap Brown Orandas\u201d\u201cWhat? Redcap Brown Orandas?\u201d The middle-aged man was slightly stunned as he squatted down hurriedly.\u201cThey are Redcap Brown Orandas! They are!\u201d The middle-aged man looked at the Redcap Brown Orandas in the styrofoam box dumbfoundedly.\u201cAre they very expensive?\u201d The pretty lady asked with doubt when she saw the astonished look of the middle-aged man.\u201cYes,\u201d he nodded, \u201cI did not expect there would be five. They look even more exquisite than those in the exhibition. They are beautiful. Just too beautiful. There were two Redcap Brown Orandas in the fair, priced at $430,000 each. I heard they sold two of them yesterday.\u201d\u201cWhat? Each of them cost $430,000?\u201d The pretty lady gasped with an unbelievable expression.The young man at the side had his eyes wide open as he looked at the goldfish in the styrofoam box again. He stuttered, \u201cHow\u2026how could this be possible?\u201d\u201cThe Redcap Brown Orandas are the most noble breed among all the goldfish breeds. I won\u2019t be exaggerating to say it\u2019s one of\u00a0hundreds and thousands or more,\u201d said the middle-aged man at a steady pace.\u201cThis arowana is a beautiful Chilli Red Arowana. It is so beautiful.\u201dThe old man who popped his head over was not paying attention to the Redcap Brown Orandas. Instead, he fixed his gaze upon the red arowana.\u201cHow is it, Sir? This is the premium Chilli Red Arowana.\u201d Wang Xian asked smilingly when he saw the old man staring at the Chilli Red Arowana. He knew he met someone who understood the value of the fish.\u201cHighest quality!\u201d the old man exclaimed. \u201cThis is the most beautiful Arowana I\u2019ve ever seen. Young chap, how can you contain it in a cheap styrofoam box? You are\u2026 you are\u2026\u201dThe old man kept shaking his head as he exclaimed.\u201cThis Arowana does look beautiful, but I don\u2019t really know much about Arowana. Sir, is this really a premium grade?\u201d asked the middle-aged man doubtfully.\u201cNot only is this a premium grade Arowana, I doubt the previous one from Town Wen that was worth three million was any better quality than this. The chilli-red scales give off a shiny glow, and the barbel at the mouth is prominent. This is simply beautiful. Young chap, how much are you selling this Arowana for?\u201d asked the old man as he exclaimed.Wang Xian went silent for a while when he heard the old man. He pondered before he answered, \u201cThree million. I\u2019ll sell this for three million. On the other hand, I\u2019ll sell these Redcap Brown Orandas at $350,000 each.\u201dBoth the old man and the middle-aged man were slightly stunned.\u201cThe Redcap Brown Orandas were sold at $430,000 each in the exhibition. You\u2019re selling them cheap.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, if you go to a first-tier city and auction this Arowana, I\u2019m sure the price will be more than three million,\u201d the old man suggested.\u201cNo, I\u2019ll stick to this pricing.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head. He wanted to sell them for cash as soon as possible. Hence, it did not matter even if he sold them at a lower price.Besides, these goldfish and Arowana only consumed forty points of Dragon Energy.The consumption was slightly higher for upgrading the Arowana. To upgrade one arowana, it would consume thirty points of Dragon Energy.The young man found their conversation hard to believe. He looked at his wallet and the BMW 5 series\u2019 car key on his hand. Without any word, he stuffed them back to his pocket and pulled the pretty lady who was squatting down beside him.The pretty lady stood up and gazed at the goldfish and the Arowana in the styrofoam box.She thought she had a rather wealthy boyfriend. Yet, it was still far-fetched for him judging by the current circumstances. A few fish that cost four to five million\u2026Wang Xian did not care about the young man and the pretty girl who left. At this time, a few more customers crowded around him, as they\u2019d overheard the conversation just now.\u201cAre they really the Redcap Brown Orandas?\u201d\u201cIs there a premium Chilli Red Arowana over here?\u201dA few customers walked over and asked curiously.\u201cYes, these are the premium Redcap Brown Orandas that are even more beautiful than those in the fair. Look, there is another rare Arowana.\u201d The middle-aged man pointed out for the three customers at the side.\u201cReally?\u201d the three customers came over. When they saw the goldfish and the arowana, they wore shocked faces immediately.\u201cYou\u2019re right. They are the Redcap Brown Orandas and a premium Arowana.\u201d\u201cGosh, five of them. Young chap, did you say one for $350,000?\u201d\u201cYes, one for $350,000. It\u2019s $80,000 cheaper than the ones they\u2019re selling in the fair. On top of this, this Arowana is selling for three million.\u201d Wang Xian answered.\u201c$80,000 cheaper than buying from the fair. This is quite a deal.\u201d A middle-aged man nodded.\u201cWhere is the Redcap Brown Oranda that is $80,000 cheaper than the ones in the fair?\u201d More passers-by popped over with curiosity.\u201cRedcap Brown Oranda that is cheaper by $80,000?\u201d A group of people who just walked out from the fair joined the crowd with dubiousness.When the crowd gathered, it was another round of commotion.As more people joined in, the number of bystanders who were watching it for fun grew. One after another, they walked over to check out the fish when they heard that the Redcap Brown Orandas were selling at $80,000 cheaper than the fair.Soon, dozens of people gathered around Wang Xian, and the crowd eventually grew to a size that jammed the road.\u201cYoung chap, did you say you are selling the Redcap Brown Oranda for $350,000? I\u2019ll get two.\u201d At this moment, a middle-aged man called out.\u201cFinally, business opens.\u201dWang Xian was thrilled as more potential buys surfaced after more than dozens of people gathered.\u201cOkay, $700,000 in total. You can check. I promise there isn\u2019t any problem with them,\u201d said Wang Xiang immediately.\u201cSure, can the person in front let me pass?\u201d A middle-aged man came to the front and looked at the goldfish in the styrofoam box. With satisfaction on his face, \u201cNo issue. They look just fine with strong vitality.\u201d\u201cCan I pay through bank transfer?\u201d asked the middle-aged man while looking at Wang Xian.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOf course.\u201d Wang Xian nodded immediately.\u201cOkay, I will get these two Redcap Brown Oranda. Here\u2026, wait. I think I\u2019d better buy a small fish tank.\u201d\u201cSir, I should be giving you the fish tank. I\u2019ll pay you some money to bring me a few tanks back too.\u201d Wang Xian handed two bills to the middle-aged man.\u201cHeh, young chap, you\u2019re honest. Hang on. I\u2019ll bring you a few more fish tanks. It\u2019s unsightly to put something so valuable in a styrofoam box.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please check your online banking account.\u201dA middle-aged man spoke to Wang Xian in front of the goldfish fair after completing the fund transfer.\u201cAlright, I have received it.\u201d Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face. After he noticed the crowd in front of him, he shouted loudly, \u201cThere are three more top-grade Redcap Brown Oranda selling for $350k each. No restock after these are sold. In addition, there\u2019s a top-grade Chilli Red Arowana selling for three million dollars. Feel free to come and take a look.\u201d\u201cGive me one.\u201d After seeing someone else had purchased it, more people in the crowd were tempted, considering the fact that the price was cheaper than those in the goldfish fair by eighty thousand dollars.At such a cheap price, they might even be able to earn several tens of thousands by flipping it.\u201cAlright.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile. He immediately placed the Redcap Brown Oranda into a fishbowl and handed it to that old man.With another $350k transferred into his account, Wang Xian was getting a little agitated. He had $1.05 million in his account now!\u201cThere are two more Redcap Brown Oranda and a Chilli Red Arowana.\u201d Wang Xian shouted towards the crowd that had grown to close to a hundred people.At this very moment, Director Zhao, who was at the service counter for the organizing party, looked at the exhibition hall in doubt.\u201cWhy are there so few people?\u201dSeveral middle-aged and old men at the side frowned slightly and seconded, \u201cYeah, where did everybody go?\u201d\u201cDirector Zhao, Director Lian,\u201d shouted an employee as he ran towards them.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Why are you so flustered?\u201d Director Zhao looked at the young man, frowned and asked.\u201cDirector Zhao, something bad has happened. There\u2019s a guy who set up a stall at the entrance selling Redcap Brown Oranda at the price of $350k each. He has already sold a total of three fish.\u201d The young man replied anxiously.\u201cWhat? There\u2019s someone selling Redcap Brown Oranda? At $350k each?\u201d Director Zhao looked at the young man with a face of disbelief.\u201cYes, Director Zhao. $350k each. There are over a hundred people who have gathered at that place currently.\u201d The young man nodded his head immediately.\u201c$350k each and he has already sold three.\u201d Director Zhao was a little displeased. He stood up immediately and headed out.When he was at the entrance, he saw a group of people crowding the entrance.\u201cI\u2019ll take the last two Redcap Brown Oranda.\u201dAt this moment, Director Zhao heard a guy beside him shout loudly.\u201cExcuse me.\u201d The middle-aged man said to the people in front of him as he tried to make his way forward.Director Zhao looked around and squeezed forward behind the man with displeasure.\u201cAlright, these are the last two Redcap Brown Oranda.\u201d After hearing the man, Wang Xian replied with a faint smile.\u201cBank transfer.\u201d The middle-aged man said and nodded his head in satisfaction after walking forward and seeing the two Redcap Brown Oranda.\u201cAlright.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head.Director Zhao, who was following behind, felt embarrassed instantly. He took a glance at the two Redcap Brown Oranda and the styrofoam box at the side. His mouth started twitching uncontrollably.\u201cDamn it. Did he keep the goldfish that are worth several million in a styrofoam box? Playing dumb to take advantage of others!\u201dDirector Zhao was clearly displeased. After this brat sold Redcap Brown Oranda at $350k each, it would be impossible for him to sell his Redcap Brown Oranda in the goldfish fair at $430k. In fact, he might not be able to sell them even if he reduced the price to $350k.Wang Xian noticed Director Zhao but didn\u2019t pay much attention to him. He continued, \u201cThere\u2019s one last top-grade Chilli Red Arowana left. You can take it for just three million.\u201d\u201cThis Arowana is really beautiful but the price is too high.\u201d\u201cThis top-grade chili red Arowana is definitely worth three million dollars. However, that\u2019s three million! Who could afford it?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. It\u2019s too expensive. However, if I had the money, I would definitely buy it. This chili red Arowana is simply too beautiful. \u201dThe surrounding crowd was discussing and commenting. An Arowana that cost three million dollars was indeed not easy to sell.Wang Xian heard the conversation of the people in the crowd and frowned slightly. Arowana that cost several million was indeed not so easy to sell. There weren\u2019t many people who could afford it.However, what made him the most disappointed was that there was no one who bought the chili red Arowana.The crowd of customers simply left after admiring it for some time.\u201cDamn it. If I had known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have upgraded such an expensive Arowana.\u201d Wang Xian looked at the time and it was already three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Yet, the Arowana was still not sold.Although there was always a huge crowd looking at it, there weren\u2019t many who could have afforded it.Just like what they had commented, it was too expensive.\u201cPhew!\u201dWang Xian waited all the way to five o\u2019clock and hadn\u2019t even had his lunch.\u201cForget it, I\u2019m not selling it anymore. I have $1.75 million in my hands now and it should be sufficient.\u201dWang Xian was a man who was easily contented. Although he couldn\u2019t sell this Arowana, it didn\u2019t really affect his mood.After all, he had still been working hard for several hundreds of dollars a few days ago.After placing the Arowana into the styrofoam box, Wang Xian rode his Harley towards the school.He put the Arowana in his dormitory room and headed directly for the First-grade Seafood Restaurant.With more than $1.7 million in his account, he wouldn\u2019t be lacking money in the short term.\u201cLet\u2019s head to the ocean tomorrow and see if I can raise my own level.\u201dWang Xian made the decision in his mind.Rivertown was a town that was beside the sea and in the vicinity of Bohai Sea.Bohai Sea was one of the four main seas in the country. At the same time, it was the only inland sea.The size of Bohai Sea was the smallest among the four seas. At the same time, it has the shallowest seabed.\u201cJust perfect for myself.\u201dThe next morning, Wang Xian rode his heavy-duty motorcycle and headed towards the sea.He took a look at his attributes.Name: Wang XianRace: Human (Ability to transform into a Dragon)Level: 1Dragon Energy: 25/1,000Superpower: Dominate the marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animals that are lower than your own level)Devour any form of marine animals (For extraction of dragon energy)Art of Cultivation: Divine Dragon TransformationI\u2019m still not powerful enough at the moment and can only move around in the shallows region of Bohai Sea. If I encounter marine animals like sharks, I\u2019ll probably be devoured by them. Luckily, sharks are few in the vicinity of the Bohai Sea.Wang Xian thought to himself and he soon arrived at the seaside.The areas of Rivertown along the sea had become tourist and vacation hotspots after the last few years of development.In this vicinity, the environment was great and it was a rather famous tourist beach.Wang Xian parked his heavy-duty motorcycle in a parking slot before heading to a rather deserted position.After ensuring that there wasn\u2019t anyone in the surrounding area, Wang Xian turned his vision to the sea in front of him.The sea was boundless and the waves came one after another. Looking at the sea, Wang Xian was suddenly filled with enthusiasm.\u201cDragon coasting through the seas!\u201dWang Xian removed his clothes and entered the sea gradually.The weather in August was extremely hot. The water didn\u2019t feel cold at all as he entered into the sea.Wang Xian was exhilarated. Leaping forward, he dived into the sea directly.\u201cTurn into a dragon.\u201dHe was ebullient!Swish!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWriggling his tail slightly, Wang Xian turned into a divine dragon the size of a human\u2019s palm.While in the seas, his speed was really fast. In just a move, he was able to cover four to five meters.\u201cHaha, this is where I truly belong. Oh the great seas, here I come.\u201dWang Xian wiggled his tail excitedly as he swam towards the sea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Given my strength, I can swallow fish that are of a few kilograms at once.\u201dWang Xian was dissatisfied as he looked at the increment of 0.08 in his Dragon Energy. Currently, he could easily swallow up fish that weighed more than dozens of kilograms.As a Divine Dragon of Level One, his level of strength was equivalent to a human form of Wang Xian.Even though he was only as big as a palm, Wang Xian was fearless even if he came across fish that weighed more than dozens of kilograms.With a jerk, Wang Xian swam towards the bed of the sea.The Bohai Sea was not as deep at all, as the sun could shine directly on the seabed.Wang Xian could see small fish and prawns swimming freely over there.On the floor of the ocean, there were rocks with aquatic plants growing on them and various odd-looking moving marine life.\u201cThe lake in the school was nothing compared to the marine animals in the sea.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s eyes brightened up. He swam over swiftly while fixing his eyes on the rather massive mackerel in front of him.The mackerel was approximately four kilograms and half a meter long.Mackerel: Level 0Extractable Dragon Energy: 0.8\u201c0.8 Dragon Energy.\u201dRadiance flashed in Wang Xian\u2019s eyes as he dashed towards the mackerel.When he was about five meters away, the half-meter mackerel spotted Wang Xian who was charging towards it.The mackerel was slightly stunned as it sensed the oppression of Wang Xian. Hurriedly, it tried to flee.\u201cCan you escape?\u201dThe mackerel shuddered and did not dare to swim away when Wang Xian emanated slight Dragon Power.He darted out and gulped the half-meter mackerel.\u201cThat\u2019s too cool. Given my current Dragon Power, I can dominate the marine animals within five meters. It will cause great oppression for those who are beyond five meters too.\u201dWang Xian rocked the body of the Divine Dragon and headed somewhere far again.\u201cDominate!\u201d\u201cDominate!\u2019Along the way, when he saw the various marine animals, he would swim over and dominate them.Pacific mackerel, Spanish mackerel, yellow drum fish, slender shad fish, herring and pomfret\u2026 The smaller ones were palm-sized, whereas the bigger fish were over a few kilograms. All of them were dominated by him.At the bottom, he also spotted pairs of prawns.After swimming for a thousand meters, thousands of fish types gathered within five meters around Wang Xian.\u201cIf I can sell these as seafood, I\u2019m sure they could fetch a few hundred thousand dollars.\u201dWang Xian observed the various marine animals around him. Among those, there were tiger prawns, which were larger than a palm. If such prawns were to be sold, each one of them could sell for over a hundred dollars.\u201cThis is simply too wasteful.\u201dWang Xian laughed out. To increase his strength, he could only gobble them up.Gulp!A golden Divine Dragon was gobbling up every single marine animal in the ocean frantically.Even a fish that was around a meter long was swallowed up by him.\u201cHaha, I added over 80 points of Dragon Energy. Indeed, gobbling up the marine animals is much faster for increasing energy!\u201dWang Xian swished his dragon tail excitingly and realized his body was growing to about twenty centimeters longer now.The dragon scales turned exquisite, and the dragon claws were full of mightiness even though they were small. The two dragon beards looked dominating too.Wang Xian overturned his body and was satisfied with his boosted-up power.He moved and swam out far again.At this point, he was 4,000 to 5,000 meters away from the shore.\u201cThe nearby marine animals are still too little. I have to head farther out.\u201dWith a jolt, Wang Xian swam out to a farther place.On the way, he dominated various types of marine animals and gobbled them up crazily. His Dragon Energy was also leveling up at an extremely fast speed.\u201cThe water is much deeper ahead.\u201dWang Xian realized the ocean ahead was about 13 to 14 meters deep after swimming for approximately eight kilometers. The region was much deeper as compared to before.He noticed the entire region ahead was covered with greenish seaweed and multi-colors reefs.\u201cEh, there\u2019s a school of ribbonfish ahead?\u201dJust then, Wang Xian spotted a school of ribbonfish swimming ahead with approximately over thousands of ribbonfish closely packed together.Each of them was long in size, and among them, a few were one meter long.The ribbonfish are at Level Zero. I have nothing to fear.Wang Xian thought to himself. Ribbonfish was a type of ferocious fish. However, they did not dare to resist when confronted by the Divine Dragon.Wang Xian stared at the school of ribbonfish while swimming at high speed.Boom!He acted like an ancient divine dragon which had just descended into the ocean. When Wang Xian charged over, some of the ribbonfish was shuddering their long bodies in fear.Some of them rattled and tried to flee.\u201cWhere are you going?!\u201dWang Xian was much faster than the ribbonfish in the water. He dashed into the school of ribbonfish like a golden flash of lightning.\u201cDominate!\u201dAs he emanated his Dragon Power, the ribbonfish within five meters looked at Wang Xian as though they were worshipping him. None of them dared to move a single inch.Wang Lian smiled and opened his mouth at one of the ribbonfish.Swoosh!After he swallowed the third ribbonfish, Wang Xian suddenly noticed a commotion in the ribbonfish around him as the ribbonfish on the left gradually gave way to form a path.\u201cEh? What\u2019s this?\u201d Wang Xian\u2019s body shook as his eyes were full of solemnness.Wang Xian saw a huge ribbonfish swimming towards him, and he was somehow a little nervous about it.The ribbonfish had a long body of at least two and a half meters long with approximately thirty centimeters at the broadest part of its body. The fins on its back looked sharp.King of Ribbonfish: Level 1Extractable Dragon Energy: 88\u201cLevel One. It\u2019s a level-one King of Ribbonfish.\u201dWang Xian was looking wary all over his face.Ribbonfish are massive fish in the ocean. An average ribbonfish was less than a meter, but there were many large ribbonfish.A fishmonger was reported on the internet for catching a two-meter ribbonfish, and the fish was known as the King of Ribbonfish.Apart from the King of Ribbonfish, there was another type of colossal ribbonfish known as the Giant Oarfish.The size of Giant Oarfish could hit more than a dozen meters.\u201cLuckily, this is not the ten-meters Giant Oarfish. It\u2019s just a King of Ribbonfish, but I shall not underestimate it since it is a level one fish.\u201dWang Xian looked at the sharp teeth of the King of Ribbonfish. Given its size, he guessed he could swallow it too.The King of Ribbonfish fixed its eyes on Wang Xian as if it was observing some delicious food.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThough it sensed the immense threat from the strange-looking being in front of it, it could evolve itself if it gobbled up the unknown creature. This was the instinct of a living being.I must gobble it up.Wang Xian moved his body cautiously as he looked at the King of Ribbonfish that was swimming towards him.Get ready to fight!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His attention was fully focused on the King of Ribbonfish right in front of him.The King of Ribbonfish had a huge head that was equivalent to the size of Wang Xian. It opened its mouth slightly and revealed the lingering flesh of a small octopus on its teeth as it stared at Wang Xian viciously and wriggled its huge body towards him.\u201cPre-emptive strike.\u201dWang Xian looked at the King of Ribbonfish. Wriggling his body, he shot out like a golden arrow at the King of Ribbonfish directly to attack it.Swish!The reaction of the King of Ribbonfish was a little beyond what Wang Xian had expected and its combat prowess was no weaker than a human when it was in the water. Its sharp teeth headed towards Wang Xian directly.\u201cI can\u2019t attack it head-on.\u201dWang Xian saw the huge teeth of the King of Ribbonfish. He extended his dragon claws and acted as though he was ready for a direct clash.Tssss.Wang Xian seemed to have heard the roar of the King of Ribbonfish. It opened its mouth widely and revealed rows of sharp teeth within it.A glimpse of craftiness flashed passed Wang Xian\u2019s eyes. Just before they collided, he shifted his body and headed upwards while slashing his dragon claws towards the eyes of the King of Ribbonfish.Wang Xian belonged to the \u201cNine Claws Divine Dragon\u201d breed which was the supreme leader among the divine dragons. Although his claws were very small, they were extremely sharp.The nine claws landed on the eyes of the King of Ribbonfish directly.Just like a stone colliding with an egg, Wang Xian easily ruptured the eyes of the King of Ribbonfish.\u201cThe intelligence of marine animals can\u2019t be compared with me at all. Their attacks are very primitive and based on instincts.\u201dSeeing the King of Ribbonfish wriggling its body violently, Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised. He dived towards it and bit onto the head of the King of Ribbonfish directly with his sharp jaws.Crack crack crack.Boom!Wang Xian\u2019s jaws sank into the head of the King of Ribbonfish and it struggled violently by wagging its tail towards Wang Xian\u2019s body.Wang Xian extended his claws and slashed ruthlessly on the body of the King of Ribbonfish. The sharp claws penetrated the body directly.\u201cDevour.\u201dThe vitality of the blinded King of Ribbonfish was getting weaker and weaker. Wang Xian opened his mouth and devoured the entire King of Ribbonfish directly.\u201cAn direct increase of eighty-eight points of Dragon Energy.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s eyes lit up as he felt his body getting substantially stronger once again.I\u2019m a divine dragon coupled with the intelligence of a human, slaying marine animals of the same level is an easy task. Even if I were to encounter level Two marine animals, I wouldn\u2019t be wary.Wang Xian thought to himself. Looking at the Ribbonfish that were scattering in all directions, he quickly gave chase.One, two, three\u2026Soon, he had devoured seven to eight hundred ribbonfish. However, several hundred ribbonfish managed to escape too.Wang Xian wasn\u2019t too concerned about it. Wriggling his body, he looked at his surroundings.There were a lot of seaweed and corals in this area and the sea resources in the vicinity were ample. It was especially so for octopuses, lobsters, sea cucumbers, jellyfish and swimming crabs.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely capture some lobsters and swimming crabs when I head back tonight.\u201dLooking at the lobsters and swimming crabs around him, he suddenly had a craving.If one would like to have some lobsters or swimming crabs, it would easily hit six hundred dollars. If he was to head to First-grade Seafood Restaurant, it would probably cost six to seven hundred dollars per person.Wang Xian licked his lips before continuing to devour marine animals in the vicinity at a frantic pace.\u201cEh? There\u2019s a small island ahead.\u201dWang Xian noticed an island when he looked ahead. However, the area of the island wasn\u2019t very big.He didn\u2019t pay much attention to it as he turned his attention towards a sea snake in front of him.Sea Snake: Level OneExtractable Dragon Energy: 44\u201cSea snake! I\u2019d better not mess with it.\u201dWang Xian took a few more glances at that sea snake before taking a detour around it to capture other marine animals.Sea snakes had lethal poison. Even though they weren\u2019t as strong as the King of Ribbonfish, they had lethal poison with them. If he was poisoned to death, it would be tragic.\u201cThat\u2019s a sea turtle.\u201dWang Xian noticed that a sea turtle that was approximately a meter long was swimming near the rocks below the island.Sea Turtle: Level ThreeExtractable Dragon Energy: 988\u201cThe sea turtle is level three.\u201dWang Xian was rather shocked by that greenish sea turtle. A sea turtle was a rather docile marine animal but one shouldn\u2019t underestimate the strength of a sea turtle.Although sea turtles don\u2019t have teeth, they have sharp edges inside their mouth that are sharper than teeth. These sharp edges could easily crush one\u2019s finger. Moreover, a sea turtle of the size of close to a meter would definitely be more vicious.\u201cIn mythical legends, Dragon Palace would have a Turtle as Prime Minister. When I upgrade marine animals in the future, I could also upgrade a turtle to be the Prime Minister.\u201dSea turtle gave off the impression of intelligence and longevity. In Journey to the West, Prime Minister Turtle was 9,000 years old and would handle various kinds of matters of the Dragon Palace. Its role was similar to the Prime Minister in an ancient kingdom. [1]Wang Xian had decided to get a strong Prime Minister Turtle for himself in the future.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that my level is still too low. If I wish to upgrade marine animals, I would have to at least wait till I have raised my level to level Three.\u201dWang Xian thought to himself. In the Divine Dragon Transformation, to upgrade marine animals would first involve manifesting the intelligence of marine animals before imparting upon them the cultivation arts.This would require a large amount of dragon energy and would at least be a thousand points of dragon energy.Currently, Wang Xian only possessed an overall four hundred points of dragon energy.\u201cI\u2019m going to level up quickly and get my own subordinates.\u201dWang Xian wiggled his body and devoured the marine animals around him rapidly.\u201cThere\u2019s a large humphead wrasse ahead.\u201dAt this moment, he saw a fish that weighed approximately a hundred jin. It was a humphead wrasse!Humphead wrasse: Level OneExtractable Dragon Energy: 44\u201cI can extract forty-four points of Dragon Energy. Haha.\u201dWang Xian got excited. Moving his body, he launched his attacks rapidly towards the humphead wrasse.The humphead wrasse sensed danger approaching and wiggled its tail to swim away.\u201cDo you think you can escape?\u201dA smile appeared on Wang Xian\u2019s face. He accelerated immediately and extended his dragon claws ahead. Although he wasn\u2019t big in size yet, he still emanated an aura of power and prestige.\u201cHehe, there\u2019s no place for you to escape to anymore.\u201dThe humphead wrasse that was close to a meter long escaped below the island. Wang Xian immediately accelerated.Crack!However, at this moment, something shocked Wang Xian. When the humphead wrasse swam to a position beside the rocks, the rock-like object closed immediately and devoured the humphead wrasse that was almost eighty centimeters long.Astonishment was written all over Wang Xian\u2019s face. He immediately stopped and looked ahead.\u201cThat is\u2026?\u201dWang Xian got closer and noticed that the \u201crock\u201d wasn\u2019t a real rock but the disguise of a type of living thing.\u201cThat\u2019s a sea clam. How is it possible that there\u2019s such a big sea clam?\u201dWang Zheng was shocked. It was a brownish-colored sea clam in the shape of a fan. The entire sea clam was extremely huge and spanned close to two meters. Looking at it, it looked simple and heavy.Sea clam: Level 6Extractable Dragon Energy: 9,987Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s level is level six. Moreover, I could get extract close to ten thousand points of Dragon Energy from it.\u201dWang Xian opened his eyes widely and stared fervently at that huge sea clam.Endnote:[1] Journey to the West is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Average clams are about the size of a thumb while some bigger ones are about the size of a palm.In this world, there was also a type of sea clams called the Giant Clam, also known as the Man-eating Clam. The biggest one was 1.8 meters.However, the sea clam before Wang Xian was definitely larger than what was recorded.Wang Xian could not help but feel stupefied as he looked at the enormous sea clam.\u201cLuckily, this sea clam is moving very slowly, so I don\u2019t have to be afraid of it. Besides, the sea clam will not be able to threaten me if I just stay behind it.\u201dWang Xian stared at the sea clam as he made up his mind.If he could devour the sea clam, he could advance to Level Three with the Dragon Energy he extracted from it.Wang Xian hesitated before creeping behind the sea clam.The sea clam remained unmoved when Wang Xian closed in. Wang Xian was unsure if it was because it had just eaten or was it trying to conceal itself, as it was not moving.Wang Shan got closer and grabbed the clamshell with his claw.Boom!Wang Xian sulked when the claw that was as strong as the metal did not leave any dents on the sea clam.\u201cIt\u2019s too solid. Simply impenetrable.\u201dWang Xian looked embarrassed. He tapped another two more times with his claws but discovered no traces on the clam. The sea clam did not have any reaction either.\u201cThe shell is just too hard. I have no means to deal with it.\u201dWang Xian was thinking hard as an idea flashed across his mind.\u201cTry it.\u201dWang Xian hesitated. He looked around him before he said, \u201cTransform into a human.\u201dInstantly, from a 20-centimeter golden Divine Dragon, Wang Xian returned to his human form.Wang Xian was naked in the sea and had no issue in the water that was more than ten meters deep.He looked at the sea clam before him. With a stretch, he lifted and carried it.With his current strength, Wang Xian could at least carry four hundred kilograms of weight. Hence, he was rather relaxed to carry a sea clam of 250 kilograms in the sea.The sea clam remained unmoved when it was being carried up.Wang Xiang was delighted as he carried it to the island beside the ocean.Wang Xian swam fast in the sea. After he surfaced from the water, he put the sea clam on the shore.Sensing no seawater around it, the sea clam opened its shell at this time.A clam flesh that was covered in sticky mucus wriggled out of the shell. The flesh stuck its body to the ground. It controlled its body and squirmed towards the ocean.\u201cHaha, thinking of escaping? Where can you escape to?\u201dWang Xian was looking thrilled. He immediately grabbed and pulled the clamshell back.Slap!Just then, a piece of clam meat slapped at his arm with fast and furious speed.The force was so powerful that Wang Xian let out a yelp.\u201cGosh, that was painful.\u201dHe touched his arm in a cold sweat and realized the arm was swelling up. The entire arm would have been broken if his physique was not strengthened by the Dragon Energy.\u201cIndeed, this is the Level Six Sea Clam. Even though it was not a fighter by nature, it could still hurt me.\u201dWang Xian was surprised.\u201cHowever, don\u2019t ever think of escaping since you\u2019re thrown onto the shore.\u201dWang Xian was feeling lucky that the sea clam did not notice what was happening when they were in the ocean. Otherwise, he would not be able to have carried it to the shore, given its mighty strength.Wang Xian spotted the sea clam as it exited hurriedly towards the sea. He quickly grabbed the clamshell and flung it towards the island.Subsequently, he took a few rocks on the side and hurled them at the flesh of the opened clamshell.Wang Xian possessed daunting strength now as each mighty rock he cast caused the flesh to huddle up. The clamshell quickly shut itself up.\u201cDon\u2019t kill me. Please!\u201dJust then, Wang Xian heard a unique voice which stunned him immediately.\u201cWho? Who is talking?\u201d Wang Xian observed his surroundings with shock. But there was no one on the desolate island.\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a human language spoken just now.\u201dWang Xian thought of the voice. Immediately, he cast his gaze upon the sea clam.\u201cWas it you?\u201d Wang Xian stared with his eyes wide open.All living beings with intelligence would have their own language just like the dolphins and killer whales.However, humans would not understand their language.Despite so, as a Divine Dragon, Wang Xian could understand any language of the marine animals.\u201cLet me go. Let me go.\u201d Another sound that was frail and weak was heard. The voice sounded like a little girl who had just learned how to talk.\u201cAre you a girl? No, are you a female clam?\u201d Wang Xian stared at the sea clam and asked.\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me. Let me go.\u201d The voice of the sea clam was heard again. But, she was repeating those simple words, like, \u201cDon\u2019t kill me\u2026 let me go.\u201dIt must be that her intelligence is not high enough for her to master more sophisticated expressions.Wang Xian pondered and frowned. He never expected that this sea clam would have intelligence. Moreover, it was a female clam.\u201cGiven my current ability, it will be difficult and troublesome to kill her off unless I wait for her to dry up.\u201d\u201cLet me go. Don\u2019t kill me.\u201dOnce again, the tender and innocent voice resounded in his head again.Wang Xian hesitated. He was thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t have to kill her. I can make her my subordinate \u2013 the first member of the Dragon Palace.\u201dWang Xian brightened up his eyes and stared at the sea clam. He was thinking of how a Divine Dragon could subdue the marine animals.With an idea, he slowly tempted the sea clam, \u201cLittle Sister, I will release you now if you swallow this thing.\u201dUpon seeing no reaction from the sea clam, he squeezed out a small amount of golden blood from his hand. It was the blood of Divine Dragon, and at the same time, a form of commitment.Divine Dragons dominated the marine animals not only with domineering strength but also with the power of pact.After absorbing the Blood of Divine Dragon, the other party would regard him as the King.\u201cTake this fresh blood, and I, as your Brother, will release you.\u201dWang Xian placed the drop of fresh Blood of Divine Dragon on the sea clam and guided her patiently.\u201cDeveloped Marine Animals: Clam Girl.\u201dAt this time, the system notification sounded off in his mind. The blood on the sea clam disappeared.\u201cHaha, it works.\u201dWang Xian was excited. He quickly routed to the front of the Clam Girl.\u201cBrother, I like you.\u201dThe Clam Girl opened her clamshell. Being a low-intelligent being, she did not understand what a King was. She only knew to obey his words when he wanted her to address him as Brother.This was the power of pact.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHaha, little sister, you must listen to me from now on.\u201dWang Xian spoke delightedly.\u201cGosh.\u201dHowever, the Clam Girl wrapped her flesh around Wang Xian\u2019s body at this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The flesh of the clam was abnormally soft and gave off an aroma.She had completely wrapped around him, and he felt extremely comfortable throughout his body.The clam girl listened to his command and released him immediately. Wang Xian looked at his body covered in sticky goo. He couldn\u2019t control his mouth as it twitched slightly.\u201cWhat the\u2026!\u201dWang Xian patted his own face and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get into the sea first. Let\u2019s get into the sea first.\u201dWhen he came to the seaside, he jumped into the sea directly. The clam girl followed closely behind him into the sea.Wang Xian looked at the clam girl beside him. With just a thought, he transformed into the appearance of a divine dragon immediately.\u201cDon\u2019t address me as the brother from now on. You shall call me the Dragon King.\u201dWang Xian looked at the clam girl and found having a sea clam calling him \u201cbrother\u201d extremely weird. Moreover, he didn\u2019t have a fad in other aspects.\u201cYes, Dragon King.\u201d The voice of the clam girl was directed into his mind directly.Wang Xian nodded his head in approval. Looking at the clam girl, he was extremely satisfied.This was his first subordinate and her level was level 6! Although her attacking prowess was rather weak, her defense capability was insane.\u201cUpgrading marine animals, pacts, and cultivate intelligence. Since the intelligence of clam girl has already been cultivated, I could save myself a lot of dragon energy. If I have to rely on dragon energy to upgrade, I can just forget about it. I don\u2019t have ample dragon energy but I could impart upon her cultivation arts for her to cultivate on her own.\u201dEstablishing the dragon palace and upgrading marine animals. If Wang Xian was sufficiently powerful, he could increase the strength of marine animals directly by using dragon energy. However, helping to raise their strength was just one aspect. The other aspect would be to let them cultivate on their own.There was cultivation art related to the water tribe within the Divine Dragon Transformation.The so-called cultivation arts were, in fact, the cultivation arts of the Dragon race. For the other marine animals, these cultivation arts could also be considered as \u201cLeaping Through The Dragon\u2019s Gate\u201d.There were many different types of cultivation arts to make the Leap Through The Dragon Gate, including the water dragon\u2019s cultivation arts, fire dragon\u2019s cultivation arts, frost dragon\u2019s cultivation arts and other kinds of cultivation arts.\u201cClam girl is more suited for the cultivation arts of the water dragon. I can impart it to her directly.\u201dWith just a thought, he imparted the cultivation art on clam girl immediately.\u201cThis is cultivation art. You must definitely cultivate diligently from today onwards.\u201dWang Xian spoke to the clam girl. When clam girl achieved mastery over the cultivation art, she would have a chance of transforming into human form. Moreover, by practicing the cultivation art of the water dragon, she wouldn\u2019t be weaker than ordinary water dragons when she grew up.\u201cYes, Dragon King,\u201d answered the clam girl.\u201cYeah.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head. \u201cYou shall practice in the vicinity of this island from here onward and be careful!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d replied the clam girl. She opened her clamshell and ejected the stone that Wang Xian had thrown in previously.\u201cEh? What are those?\u201dSuddenly, Wang Xian saw several shiny objects within the body of the clam girl.\u201cThese are\u2026? Pearls?\u201dWang Xian\u2019s eyes lit up. He extended his hand over and retrieved the objects from the clam girl\u2019s body.There were over 10 crystal clear pearls. There were white, black, pink and golden pearls with each one of them perfectly round without any flaws.Each pearl was at least twenty millimeters in diameter and looked extremely beautiful.\u201cSo beautiful. Such huge pearls.\u201dWang Xian looked at the sixteen pearls in his hand with awe. \u201cSuch big and exquisite pearls would definitely be very valuable. Haha, it should be worth a lot of money.\u201dPearls came from the body of sea clams and natural pearls had always been very valuable.Wang Xian held onto the sixteen pearls and looked at the clam girl. \u201cThese pearls\u2026 Can you get more of these?\u201d\u201cDragon King, these pearls are from the remains of what I consumed and are formed slowly over time.\u201d\u201cThey would appear after a certain period of time. I don\u2019t like them and would just throw them all out.\u201d\u201cWhat? They appeared once in a certain period of time and were all thrown out by you?\u201d Wang Xian\u2019s mouth was twitching after hearing what she said.\u201cHow long do they take to form?\u201d he immediately asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d answered clam girl.\u201cHmm\u2026 Forget it. Clam girl doesn\u2019t have a sense of time after all.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head helplessly before instructing her, \u201cIf there are pearls in the future, you have to keep them.\u201d\u201cYes, Dragon King.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll check out how much these are worth after I get back.\u201d Wang Xian took a look at the pearls in his hand before putting them in the sea clam.\u201cYou can cultivate here now.\u201dWang Xian instructed the clam girl. After which, he looked around him.Currently, he would just need a further four hundred more points of Dragon energy to level up. Seeing that it was about noon, Wang Xian decided to make the best use of his time and attempt to raise his level to Level Two by night time.Wang Xian looked towards a sturgeon. Moving his body, he headed towards it and attacked it.Devour! Frantic devouring!Dragon energy was increasing at a terrifying pace.\u201cThere\u2019s another school of ribbonfish right there.\u201dIt was afternoon time. When Wang Xian swam out another twenty kilometers, he encountered another school of ribbonfish.This school of ribbonfish was three to four times larger than the school he encountered in the morning. Three to four thousand fish were swimming together and it was a majestic scene to witness.\u201cIf I devoured all of them, I would be close to Level Two. When I\u2019m at Level Two, my strength will also be substantially greater.\u201dWang Xian was getting excited. His vision was locked onto the school of ribbonfish as he dashed towards it directly.The current Wang Xian was approximately thirty centimeters and was still relatively much smaller as compared to the ribbonfish.However, the aura that he was emitting was causing the ribbonfish to tremble in fear.Growl!A weak dragon roar erupted as Wang Xian started his devouring. Ribbonfish after ribbonfish was easily devoured and turned into dragon energy within Wang Xian.Three to four thousand ribbonfish were completely devoured by him in half an hour.These included three top-grade Kings of Ribbonfish. Despite facing against three of them at the same time, he still killed and devoured all three of the Kings of Ribbonfish.Name: Wang XianRace: Human (Able to transform into a Dragon)Level: 1Dragon Energy: 997/1,000Superpower: Dominate the marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animals that are lower than your own level)Devour any form of marine animals (For extraction of dragon energy)Art of Cultivation: Divine Dragon Transformation\u201cThree more points to make the breakthrough.\u201dWang Xian got excited and swam to his left. All he had to do was to devour another ten fish before his level could be raised to Level Two.\u201cThis is bad. That\u2019s a shark.\u201dJust as he swam a dozen meters ahead, he suddenly saw a shark swimming towards him.\u201cIt must have been drawn here because of the bloody scent I caused when devouring the ribbonfish.\u201dWang Xian had an idea while looking at the shark that was approximately three meters long.Horn shark: Level FourExtractable Dragon Energy: 443Run! I\u2019m definitely not a match for it.After seeing the level of the horn shark, Wang Xian immediately escaped towards the sea at the side.That horn shark seemed to have seen Wang Xian as it immediately wiggled its tail and chased after Wang Xian.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh damn. I\u2019m already escaping and yet you have to chase me.\u201dWhen Wang Xian felt the horn shark heading towards him at high speed, he accelerated towards the seaside.Luckily, his speed was faster. When he reached the area with seaweed all around him, the horn shark lost him.\u201cI still couldn\u2019t get too far as I\u2019m too weak currently. If I had encountered several vicious sharks, I\u2019d be finished.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instantly, Wang Xian felt his tremendous power surging from his body.Kakaka.The bones throughout his whole body let out crisp sounds. The 40-centimeter dragon body grew longer to approximately a meter long.By now, Wang Xian\u2019s entire body was giving off a golden glow. The tremendous power swirled in the seawater around him.\u201cI have advanced to Level Two.\u201dSensing the immense power from his body, Wang Xian could not hide his exhilarating expression.Every scale and bone in his entire body was greatly enhanced, in particular, the claws. He was full of mighty explosive force.Roar!The sea water around him rippled as the dragon roared.\u201cI have become stronger by at least tenfold.\u201dWang Xian felt the immense strength within his body. He clenched his claws and cast a glance to the boulder at the side.Ka!With a swing, Wang Xian shattered the sturdy boulder easily.\u201cI\u2019m already so powerful even when I have not acquired the Superpower. If I have enough Dragon Energy to cultivate my Superpower, I\u2019ll grow even more formidable.\u201dThe Divine Dragon was the same dragon when he just started to practice the Divine Dragon Transformation.Superpowers were things like infernos, water current, frost, and skeletons.He could grow his claw longer with Dragon Energy while Superpower would be required for enhancing his body\u2019s flexibility, acquiring techniques like spurting out fire and water, and generating electricity.All these required Dragon Energy for upgrading.The current Wang Xian only possessed the physical body of a Divine Dragon but its Superpower.However, just the physical body was daunting enough.\u201cI\u2019m just at Level Two now, and the power was incredibly strong even before I got to my First Transformation. When I attained the Nine Divine Dragon Transformations, does that mean I can roam the entire universe?\u201dWang Xian was feeling passionate. He swam to the sea clam not far from him and reminded the Clam Girl to cultivate diligently before he headed back to the shore.The sky gradually turned dark. His speed was considered fast since he had advanced one level within a day.But it would require 10,000 points of Dragon Energy to advance to Level Three. Subsequently, each level of advancement required ten times the Dragon Energy.Level advancement at the early stages would be speedy, but it would get harder as it progressed to the later stages.After two levels of advancement, his speed was so fast that he could swim fifteen meters per second. That was way faster than many types of fish.Dragon Race were born rulers.Wang Xian swam to the shore. On his way, he caught some lobsters and swimming crabs: two lobsters that were about 1.5 kilograms each, and six swimming crabs.\u201cWooh!\u201dWang Xian put on his clothes after he was out of the sea. He grinned as he looked at the pearls, lobsters and the swimming crabs in his hands.After putting on his clothes, he headed up. \u201cBoom!\u201d Wang Xian took a gentle leap to the shore. As he did, he was off the ground by four meters.Ka!He picked up a stone from the ground and crushed it.\u201cI\u2019m simply too powerful now.\u201dWang Xian was excited. He found a bag to pack the lobsters and the swimming crabs into before he walked towards the entrance of a resort not far from him.For safety concerns, he parked his Harley motorcycle there.Vroom!Wang Xian rode on his motorcycle after placing the lobsters and the swimming crabs at a safe location. Soon after, he stepped on his accelerator and headed back to school.\u201cMy reaction and eyesight have improved greatly after advancing to Level Two.\u201dWang Xian slightly narrowed his eyes as he glanced at the motorcycle that he was riding on.Based on the speed that he was riding now, it was a total waste for such a modified motorcycle.After millions of dollars\u2019 worth of modifications, the speed of this heavy-duty motorcycle could reach a terrifying level.The maximum speed for this Harley was 397 kilometers per hour. To make a comparison, the maximum car speed of a Bugatti Veyron with a starting price of over 20 million was only 405 kilometers per hour.This modified Harley was freaking fast.The acceleration capability was faster than a sports car.Given the performance of this Harley, sports cars that were worth a few million were incomparable with this.\u201cLet\u2019s test out the speed of this heavy-duty motorcycle.\u201dWang Xian was eager to try it out. In the past, the chance of endangering his life was high if he got into an accident with this motorcycle. Hence, he did not dare to drive too fast.But now, Wang Xian\u2019s strength was greatly enhanced. Even if he traveled at two hundred kilometers per hour, he could assure his own safety if there were any accidents.Besides, given his current speed of reaction, he would be quite safe.The region near the ocean was rather remote. Not many cars could be seen on the road.Wang Xian began to change gears and stepped hard on his accelerator.Vroom!The engine of the motorcycle exploded a loud and clear sound.The corner of Wang Xian\u2019s lips was slightly drawn when he looked at the speedometer. Within five seconds, the speed increased to a hundred kilometers per hour and soon, it would hit 180.Speeding at 180 kilometers per hour was already scary as the trees on each side were moving behind at a daunting speed.\u201cFeels great. No wonder many people seek thrills from the ultimate speed to the extent that it cost their lives. This really feels good.\u201dWith his helmet on, Wang Xian zoomed off on his motorcycle in his chirpy mood.Vroom!Just then, Wang Xian suddenly heard engines vrooming from behind.\u201cShoot!\u201dA couple of sports cars passed by his motorcycle like phantoms.\u201cEh? Their speed hit at least two hundred kilometers per hour.\u201dWang Xian was slightly stunned as he watched the sports cars overtaking him. Yet, he did not chase after them in spite of his pride.Wang Xian reduced his speed to around seventy kilometers per hour before making a turn ahead.When he made a turn, he saw three sports cars lining up in one straight and neat row. Looked like they were preparing for the new round of a competition.Wang Xian\u2019s presence immediately drew the attention from the three sports cars \u2013 a\u00a0Ferrari, a Lamborghini Aventador, and a Maserati.\u201cHey, Uncle, let\u2019s race!\u201dA young girl came out from the Maserati car. She slightly raised her chin and looked at Wang Xian in a provocative way.\u201cYes, bro. Your driving skill seemed to be good. Let\u2019s have some fun.\u201d After the young girl, the window was wound down on the Ferrari as someone called out at him.\u201cYes, bro, come.\u201d The window of the Lamborghini rolled down as well while the driver called out to him.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head as he was in no mood for car racing against these kids born with a silver spoon in their mouth.\u201cYou chicken.

Come on Uncle Knight!\u201dAs the young girl spoke, she stepped on the accelerator and revved the engine.Wang Xian looked at the young girl, feeling speechless. He revved his engine too as a reply.\u201cHah, come on. If you lose, you\u2019re going to call me mum.\u201dThe young girl laughed in a loud and boisterous manner before moving her car beside the other two sports cars, forming a neat row.Wang Xian\u2019s lips arched up slightly as he moved his heavy-duty motorcycle beside the three vehicles and lined up in a row.Vroom vroom vroom!The sports cars revved their engines and Wang Xian followed by throttling his engine.\u201cThree, two, one. Start.\u201dThe young girl shouted loudly. Three sports car burst out in a straight line.Wang Xian kept a brief smile but wasn\u2019t inferior at all. The performance of his heavy-duty motorcycle was much better than those sports cars.As the race started, the advantage of the heavy-duty motorcycle was translated to a huge lead. Wang Xian increased the speed of his car to approximately 180 km/hr.Bzz, bzz, bzz!However, those three sports cars all cost no less than three million dollars. Their performances were still very outstanding.Moreover, the three of them increased their speed greatly to at least 230 km/hr or even higher.Wang Xian frowned. He glanced at the Maserati beside him and saw a young girl showing a derogatory hand signal at him.\u201cIf you want to play, I\u2019ll play.\u201dWang Xian lowered his body slightly. When riding a heavy-duty motorcycle, one would typically lower his body and lean on the motorcycle when one was moving at extreme speed. This was to reduce air resistance and also to gain better control.\u201cThe moment I lowered my head, you guys lose.\u201dWang Xian was smiling in his helmet as he throttled the accelerator to the maximum. The needle of the speedometer was increasing at a frantic pace.200, 210, 220.In just a short span of ten seconds, he had increased the speed to 280 km/hour.Bzz Bzz!A thunderous sound erupted from the Harley heavy-duty motorcycle. Wang Xian lowered his head and overtook the three sports cars rapidly and accelerated away at an even greater speed.\u201cOh damn, he\u2019s fast. Mommy\u2019s coming for you.\u201dWithin the Maserati, the young girl stepped on the accelerator fully in anger as she saw Wang Xian\u2019s figure disappearing at a fast pace.\u201cXiao Wan, you are a crazy brat. Lower the speed immediately,\u201d the beautiful girl sitting in the car said with a pale face.\u201cSister Lingling, don\u2019t be afraid. Just look at how I\u2019m going to overtake him.\u201d The young girl didn\u2019t pay attention to her as she stared at the heavy-duty motorcycle in front of her.\u201cTrying to compete with me? Little brat!\u201d Seeing that he was almost at the road juncture, a faint smile appeared on his face.\u201cHuh? This is bad!\u201dAt this moment, Wang Xian saw a large truck turning in from the road juncture. His expression changed slightly.He immediately pressed the brakes as he focused all his intention attentively on the large truck while being ready to jump off the ride at any time.Screech! \u201dThe bike isn\u2019t stopping in time!\u201dWang Xian held his breath, squinted his eyes slightly and saw a two-meter opening on his left.TssssssssWang Xian got through the opening and avoided the largest by the slimmest margin before stopping.\u201cPhew!\u201dBang, bang, bang!Just as he heaved a sigh of relief, he heard three collisions.Wang Xian\u2019s expression changed slightly. He stopped his heavy-duty motorcycle immediately and looked ahead.Three sports cars had all collided with the large truck.\u201cOh damn. Please don\u2019t tell me anyone\u2019s dead.\u201dWang Xian frowned and ran towards the three sports cars immediately.There were a total of six people sitting in the three sports cars. Among them, the Maserati, which was at the forefront, had the worst collision. On the other hand, the collision of the Lamborghini and Ferrari weren\u2019t that serious.Nonetheless, the strong impact from the collision knocked everyone in the vehicles unconscious.Wang Xian immediately ran to the Maserati at the front position.The front of the Maserati had been turned into complete scrap. The airbags of the car had popped opened, but the young girl and the beautiful girl in the car were lying there and not moving at all.The Maserati was driving the fastest. The large truck turned all of a sudden and they couldn\u2019t stop their car in time.Seeing that the car door was damaged from the collision, he reached out and tried to pull the door open.Crack crack!Wang Xian\u2019s strength ripped the car door apart directly. He saw the beautiful girl on the seat beside the driver and carried her out carefully.Huh? The legs of the young girl are almost deformed.Wang Xian looked at the young girl in the driver seat. Her legs were hit by the metal plate in front of her seat and had been deformed. She probably had a few fractures.He immediately carried her out carefully.\u201cI shall call the police first.\u201dAfter placing the two girls on the floor, Wang Xian immediately called for the police and ambulance.After which, he ran to the other two sports cars. The people inside the other two sports cars didn\u2019t seem to have suffered serious injuries. Therefore, he didn\u2019t attempt to move them rashly.\u201cSo painful, so painful.\u201dAt this moment, Wang Xian heard a weak wail. He immediately walked over and saw the young girl wailing in pain with tears in her eyes.Wang Xian frowned at the sight of the girl\u2019s completely deformed legs.\u201cSave me, save me. I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d The young girl looked at Wang Xian and begged. She was no longer the same as the naughty girl from before.Wang Xian had a heavy look. \u201cLet\u2019s see if dragon energy could be used to treat them.\u201dWith just a thought, he placed his hand on the legs of the girl, regulated his dragon energy into the legs of the young girl and nourished her injuries.As the dragon energy entered her legs, he could sense the internal situation of the legs of the young girl.\u201cBone fractures that will require adjustment.\u201dHe hesitated for a while before holding the right leg of the young girl.This brat has a rather good figure. Wang Xian couldn\u2019t help but compliment in his heart after he looked at the girl\u2019s long legs and her well-endowed chest while adjusting the bones of her legs slightly.Hmm, it\u2019s indeed effective. Under the nourishment of dragon energy, the injuries on her legs should be able to recover quickly. However, I have just advanced to level Two and don\u2019t have additional dragon energy left remaining in my body. Therefore, I can only use this method to nourish.Wang Xian thought to himself.\u201cIt hurts. It hurts.\u201d The young girl wailed softly as tears streamed down constantly.\u201cHehe, little brat. If it wasn\u2019t for me, your legs would be crippled. How dare you to have asked me to call you \u2018mum\u2019 before?\u201dWang Xian looked at the young girl and raised his eyebrows. He wore a cunning smile on his face and continued, \u201cYour injuries are serious and I can save you now.\u201d\u201cSave me, save me.\u201d The young girl shouted in pain without consciousness.\u201cI can save you but you have to call me daddy. Otherwise, I won\u2019t save you.\u201d Wang Xian said to the young girl while staring at her teasingly.\u201cSave me. Waaa!\u201d When the young girl heard his words, she immediately broke down and cried out loud.\u201cCall me daddy.\u201d Wang Xian pinched her leg and the girl shuddered.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDaddy. Waaaa. Daddy save me. Waaaa~\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201dEndnote:Daddy could be considered an insultPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If I have sufficient Dragon Energy, I can inject it into her body, and her legs would recover immediately.Wang Xian thought to himself as he looked at the young lady who was in a coma after he had fixed her leg.Subsequently, he came to the pretty girl and examined her condition with the Dragon Energy.\u201cHer chest has some blood clotting due to the impact of the hit.\u201dWang Xian took a look at her injuries and proceeded to nourish her with his Dragon Energy. Soon after, he came to check on the rest of the four people in the other two sports cars.Apart from the juvenile with a broken rib bone which had been fixed by Wang Xian with his Dragon Energy, the rest were only suffering from light injuries.The young lady and the juvenile with his broken rib bone were the two most serious cases.Just then, the traffic police and the ambulance arrived, and Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cThree luxurious sports cars got into an accident!\u201dThe traffic police officers who rushed here sped up their pace as they came over.\u201cYoung chap, were you the one who called the police?\u201dA middle-aged traffic police officer asked this immediately when he saw Wang Xian.Wang nodded, \u201cYes, it was me. I examined those people, and there shouldn\u2019t be anything serious.\u201d\u201cChief, look at these sports cars. That car plate of the Maserati seemed like the one that was just applied by the granddaughter of Old Xue.\u201dThe young man who was following behind the middle-aged officer spoke softly to him.\u201cEh?\u201d The middle-aged officer looked at the car plate, 2333, and frowned immediately. \u201cYes, it\u2019s the granddaughter of Old Xue. The rest of them must not be ordinary people either. Go check on them.\u201dThe middle-aged officer ran to Wang Xian and took a look at the young girl and the pretty girl.\u201cShe\u2019s the granddaughter of Old Xue,\u201d Cold sweat broke on his forehead, \u201cPlease, nothing must happen to her. Nothing.\u201dHe spotted the ambulance nearby and screamed at the top of his lungs, \u201cParamedics, over here. Hurry!\u201dA few paramedics brought the stretcher and sprinted over immediately.\u201cHang on, let me examine her first,\u201d said a doctor to the two nurses who were walking by the side. She squatted down and began to examine the injuries of the young lady.\u201cHer leg was injured, but it was almost healed by me. She just needs some time to fully recover. The pretty girl beside her had some blood clotted at her chest area. I have taken care of it, and it shouldn\u2019t pose any serious problems. On top of that, the young driver of the Ferrari had a broken rib, which I also took care of. Just be careful when you guys move them.\u201dThe doctor who was doing the examination was slightly stunned. She lifted her chin to look at Wang Xian with astonishment.Wang Xian, too, looked back at the doctor and could not help but feel slightly surprised. Where did all the pretty ladies come from?This doctor was in her late twenties. Her white robe was propped up and could not hide her busty figure.Her face was fair and refined. She looked like a goddess as her hair was worn up in a bun.The doctor reached out to touch the legs of the young girl, and a shocked expression gradually surfaced on her face. She did notice some problems with the young girl\u2019s legs.\u201cBe careful, bring her up to the ambulance without moving her legs.\u201d\u201cYes, Doctor Sun.\u201d The two nurses nodded immediately.\u201cHave you practiced medicine before?\u201d Doctor Sun stood up and asked curiously.\u201cEh\u2026 just a little. You should do a recheck to be certain.\u201d Wang Xian chuckled.He knew nothing about medicine. All he did was treat the patients with Dragon Energy.Doctor Sun did not ask much as she began to examine the rest of the casualties.She lifted the clothes at the chest area of the pretty lady and examined her injuries. Once again, she was shocked, \u201cShe was injured at her chest area. Avoid touching it.\u201dSubsequently, she came to the other sports car and began her examination.\u201cIt was the rib. That young man is really superb.\u201dDoctor Sun examined everyone and was stunned by the outcomes.Given such a situation, she would have taken a long time to examine the injuries if not for the young man who had reported to her on their conditions.\u201cOkay, I\u2019m off now,\u201d said Wang Xian to the traffic police officers and the doctor.Seeing that all the casualties were moved into the ambulance from the sports cars, Wang Xian checked on the time, and it was almost seven o\u2019clock.\u201cYoung chap, please leave your contact number so that we can contact you when necessary,\u201d said the middle-aged traffic police officer.\u201cSure.\u201d Wang Xian nodded and left his contact number.Doctor Sun gave him a significant look before she got onto the ambulance.\u201cA car race almost got someone killed.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head and walked to the side. He rode on his motorcycle and headed back to school.\u201cChief, that young man rides a Harley motorcycle. His family must be quite well-off.\u201d The young police officer gazed at Wang Xian\u2019s back view as he left.\u201cHmm, let\u2019s ignore the rest for now. We need to check on the situation in the hospital. Let\u2019s hope the granddaughter of Old Xue and the rest of the young fellows will be fine. Those guys\u2019 family backgrounds were not ordinary either,\u201d said the middle-aged officer.\u201cThe big car was on the wrong side of the road, and those sports cars were driving too fast. Hence, the car accident. The car owner of that truck will be in deep shit soon.\u201dAt this time, Doctor Sun was examining both legs of the young lady with a piece of equipment in the ambulance. Her expression was aghast.\u2026\u2026\u201cHow could this be possible? Both her legs were obviously fractured. Yet, they were fixed by some formidable treating skill. Could that young man be a skillful practitioner?\u201d\u2026By now, Wang Xian had reached the school entrance on his motorcycle.He cast a glance at the lobsters and swimming crabs on the car before he came to a convenience store as he rubbed his hands.After purchasing some sauces, he came back to his dormitory immediately.\u201cI\u2019ll put the pearls somewhere first, then do some cooking outdoors.\u201dWang Xian grinned.Outdoor barbecue was one of the highlights of the University of Rivertown. At the Eastern Hill of the university lay a perfect spot for outdoor barbecue.The holes were already dug. Just bringing along pots, wood, and fire would do.The glutton Wang Dahai had all the necessary tools for outdoor cooking. Wang Xian took the pot and fetched some water. He carried all his ingredients and headed for the Eastern Hill.The Eastern Hill was a hillock located at the side of the Pavilion Lake. Setting up fire was extremely safe as there were neither trees nor grass.The sky gradually darkened as Wang Xian carried his things to the Eastern Hill.Buzz!Just then, his phone suddenly rang. He took a look and found it was Guan Shuqing.\u201cI have yet to thank you for what happened a few days ago. Have you taken your dinner? I would like to treat you as a token of appreciation.\u201dWang Xian looked at the Wechat message that Guan Shuqing had sent. He was slightly taken aback, but he quickly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, thank you.\u201dHuh?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGuan Shuqing was slightly stunned by Wang Xian\u2019s reply.Since she was young, no one had ever turned her down. He was the first one to do so.At first, like any other guys, she thought Wang Xian would send her chatting messages after adding her on Wechat. But he did not.Now, she was once again rejected after initiating a dinner with him. She could not help but feel her face and doubt her charm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I definitely owe you a treat.\u201dGuan Shuqing held onto her phone and sent the message.This man is really different from others. Or maybe he\u2019s gay?That\u2019s the only explanation Guan Shuqing could come up with.\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Xian was boiling water and cleaning off the ashes of the firewood from before when he heard his phone ring. He saw Guan Shuqing\u2019s reply before looking over at the swimming crabs and large lobsters in the pot. \u201cSince I can\u2019t finish all these by myself, why don\u2019t I just ask if she would like to come over?\u201dWang Xian wasn\u2019t thinking too deeply into this matter and sent the message, \u201cI\u2019m cooking outdoors on the Eastern Hill. If you haven\u2019t eaten, why don\u2019t you just come over to the Eastern Hill?\u201dAfter sending the message out, Wang Xian started cleaning the area once again. He washed the bowls and chopsticks and started a fire.When Guan Shuqing received this message while she was in the dormitory room, she frowned slightly.\u201cCooking outdoors. Should I go? It\u2019s getting a little dark. Will he\u2026\u201d\u201cHe probably wouldn\u2019t as he isn\u2019t such a guy. Moreover, although it is summer holiday, there\u2019s still security patrolling the area.\u201dGuan Shuqing made up her mind to go. She stood up and put on some light makeup before heading towards the Eastern Hill.When she arrived at the Eastern Hill, she saw a figure standing by the flames.\u201cJust him alone.\u201dGuan Shuqing looked over as she walked. \u201cWang Xian.\u201d\u201cHuh, if it isn\u2019t our great beauty, Guan Shuqing?\u201d Wang Xian lifted his head, looked over and saw Guan Shuqing switching on the flashlight of her mobile phone.\u201cI take that you\u2019re in a good mood, cooking outdoors so late.\u201d Guan Shuqing walked over and saw Wang Xian preparing the sauce. She was shocked and asked, \u201cWang Xian, what delicious dishes are you making?\u201d\u201cSeafood. I caught them from the sea today.\u201dWang Xian lifted his head and looked at her.Guan Shuqing was still as beautiful as always today. Guan Shuqing was a well-known goddess of the University of Rivertown, and it was pretty good to be able to have a meal with such a beautiful lady.Of course, on the condition that they get along.\u201cWow, seafood. It seems like I\u2019ll be in for a treat today.\u201d Guan Shuqing squatted down. She looked at the covered pot first before turning her attention to Wang Xian.Under the illumination of the flame, he had a very unique aura. Appearance-wise, Wang Xian was definitely a handsome guy.Guan Shuqing found a rock and sat down on it. \u201cIt should be me who is supposed to give you a treat and yet you are the one who invited me to have seafood. Why don\u2019t I give you a treat tomorrow night? What do you think about that?\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Wang Xian looked at her and continued, \u201cIt will be my honor to be given a treat from the goddess of Rivertown!\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t I feel that way? You still said that it wasn\u2019t necessary just a while ago.\u201d Guan Shuqing gave him an angry stare.\u201cHehe,\u201d Wang Xian laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s because I feel that I didn\u2019t really help you out. It was just a little thing after all.\u201d\u201cWhat you did isn\u2019t just a little thing,\u201d replied Guan Shuqing as she shook her head.\u201cAlright, the food is cooked. Let\u2019s get started quickly. I\u2019ll get the sauce ready for you.\u201d Wang Xian opened the lid to the pot and passed over a bowl of sauce that he had prepared previously to Guan Shuqing.\u201cWow, lobsters and crabs.\u201d Guan Shuqing was shocked when she saw two large lobsters and swimming crabs, each seemingly weighing two to three jin, in the pot.\u201cHehe.\u201d Wang Xian smiled. \u201cYeah, they were all caught from the sea.\u201dAs Wang Xian spoke, he scooped out a large lobster from the pot. After which, he deshelled the head, grabbed the tail and passed it to Guan Shuqing. \u201cTake it. We can each have one large lobster. If you hadn\u2019t come, I might not have been able to finish them all by myself.\u201d\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d Guan Shuqing took it joyously.\u201cBe careful, it\u2019s hot.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dGuan Shuqing took over a large lobster that was even bigger than her palm and gently removed the shell.\u201cIt smells so good!\u201d exclaimed Guan Shuqing happily.\u201cThe taste is pretty good.\u201d Wang Xian dipped it into the sauces he\u2019d prepared. It was extremely satisfying to have wild large lobsters together with the tasty sauces.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect I\u2019d be so lucky to be in for such a sumptuous dinner.\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian and spoke with a face of smiles.\u201cHmm. I\u2019ve brought two bottles of alcohol with me. Do you want some?\u201d Wang Xian asked, taking out the beer Wang Dahai had placed in the dormitory.\u201cLobsters with beer! Give me a bottle, then. However, I won\u2019t be able to finish it.\u201d Guan Shuqing extended her hand and replied with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Pass it to me if you can\u2019t finish it.\u201d Wang Xian helped her open the bottle before passing it to her.\u201cWow. This is simply too satisfying.\u201d Guan Shuqing sipped a mouthful before enjoying her lobster flesh.\u201cHave some swimming crabs too. I caught them from the sea and they are really fresh.\u201d Wang Xian scooped out a swimming crab and deshelled it like a gentleman before passing it over to her.\u201cWang Xian, you\u2019re so sweet. And the sauces you prepared are really delicious. This is fantastic. I\u2019m sure you have a girlfriend, right?\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at him and asked in a probing manner.Wang Xian\u2019s body stiffened up. He recalled the girl that chose to go with the other guy. Although she wasn\u2019t very pretty, her quiet and cute look was what he was really fond of.Sigh! He heaved a long sigh. A materialistic girl like that wasn\u2019t worthy for him to think about any further, nor was she worthy of his love.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Guan Shuqing saw his sudden change and asked curiously.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t have a girlfriend. Or rather, in my case, it ended before it even started.\u201d Wang Xian laughed in a self-deprecating manner before drinking a mouthful of beer.Guan Shuqing was slightly stunned. \u201cYou are such a great guy. I\u2019m sure you would be able to find a really beautiful girlfriend.\u201d\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m focusing on improving myself and earning a lot more money for now. My sister will be attending this school soon. I\u2019ve got to let her live her university life like a princess.\u201dGuan Shuqing saw his determined look and couldn\u2019t help but feel a little envious. \u201cI\u2019m really envious of your sister to have such a good brother. Your relationship with your sister must be really good!\u201d\u201cWe only have each other after all. My sister is really adorable and sensible,\u201d laughed Wang Xian.\u201cOnly have each other?\u201d When Guan Shuqing heard these words, she recalled what she\u2019d heard from what her good friend had gathered.Could it be that he truly only has a sister? His parents aren\u2019t around anymore?Guan Shuqing thought of her own parents suddenly. Although her father\u2019s company encountered a huge crisis this year and declared bankrupt, she still had her parents with her after all.\u201cEverything will be fine. A guy like you will definitely be very blessed in the future,\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian and remarked. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any sad things that wouldn\u2019t pass. My father\u2019s company was declared bankrupt this year and this had a huge impact on my way of living. However, I still feel that as long as I work hard, everything will become better.\u201dWang Xian looked at Guan Shuqing, who was at aside, with a little surprise. Who would have expected this girl to still be able to maintain such a way of thinking?\u201cWhat are you looking at? Cheers!\u201d Guan Shuqing noticed Wang Xian was looking at her. She lifted her head slightly, lifted her bottle of beer and replied.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt will be better, Guan Shuqing.\u201d Wang Xian lifted his beer, smiled and added, \u201cIf you have any difficulties in the future, feel free to come and look for me. I might be able to help you resolve them.\u201d\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you calling me the great beauty, Guan Shuqing? Haha!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t we friends!\u201d\u201cWah, are you treating me as friends right now? I felt like a stranger to you just moments ago.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She possessed a wealthy demeanor, but she did not have the usual arrogance and snobbish attitude that a rich girl would possess.Even though her family was bankrupt, she was not discouraged at all. Instead, she worked part-time during her summer break.Wang Xian was impressed by such a girl. She enjoyed her good life, but at the same time, she could take hardship.\u201cThank you for your dinner. This is the most delightful meal I\u2019ve had recently.\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at the guy who sent her back to her dormitory.He was the first guy who ever did so.Wang Xian grinned at her, \u201cI guess I will be having seafood for all my meals for a while. If I do, I\u2019ll tell you in advance.\u201d\u201cRight, it\u2019s a deal.\u201d Guan Shuqing stood in front of him with a sweet-looking smile on her face.\u201cOkay, bye. I\u2019m going back to take a rest.\u201d\u201cBye.\u201dGuan Shuqing watched as the guy departed with a beam. The smile was extremely sweet-looking.Guan Shuqing is a pretty girl with a good personality.After departing, Wang Xian was thinking to himself too. It was impossible for a man not to fall for beauties.I better increase my strength first. I must hit Level Four before school reopens.Wang Xian told this to himself. He went back to his room and took a bath. Then, he took out his pearls and examined them. After that, he sat in a lotus position to begin his cultivation.\u201cDragon Energy increased by 45 points.\u201dWhen Wang Xian woke up and saw the notification the next morning, sharp radiance flashed in his eyes.Since he\u2019d advanced to Level Two, his cultivation speed was two times faster than before.Wang Xian picked up the pearls beside him and headed out after washing up.He rode to the city center and began his search for jewelry stores.Pearls could only be sold to jewelry stores. Otherwise, he really had no idea who would acquire his pearls.\u201cDeep-sea Jewelry.\u201dAs Wang Xian arrived at the city center, he spotted a jewelry accessories store with luxurious decors.\u201cDeep-sea?\u201d Wang Xian looked at the name of the shop.He\u2019d heard of this name before; a locally listed company with a renowned branding.Such a well-established company should offer reasonable pricing.Wang Xian secretly pondered. While he was having his breakfast that morning, he also surveyed the value for his pearls. The natural and flawless pearls of 20mm that he had could fetch tremendous pricing.Every pearl could sell at a few hundred thousand dollars, or even higher.\u201cWelcome.\u201dUpon entering the store, the greeter who was wearing a cheongsam greeted him at the door.Wang Xian entered and began to browse the pieces of jewelry within the cabinets. Their pieces of jewelry consisted of pearls and jade, excluding the gold jewelry.All the pieces of jewelry were extremely pricey.Wang Xian observed all the accessories. A pair of earrings cost a few thousand while some of the valuable pieces of jewelry were sold at a few hundred thousand dollars onwards.\u201cSir, are you looking for anything?\u201d asked a salesgirl looking at him.\u201cI\u2019m looking for pearl jewelry.\u201d He grinned as he said.\u201cThey are over here. We have pearl necklaces, pendants, and bracelets,\u201d the salesgirl pointed to a spot and said.Wang Xian moved over and checked it out.\u201cThis pearl and jade necklace is expensive.\u201d Wang Xian spotted one at the center that cost $180,000.\u201cThese are natural pearls from the South China Sea with a size of 16mm. The colors are mellow, and they are the top-rated pearls. $180,000 is not expensive at all.\u201d\u201cMiss, can I take a look at that necklace?\u201dBefore the salesgirl could finish talking, someone at the side spoke.Wang Xian turned over and saw a middle-aged man with a beautiful girl. The middle-aged man was talking to them.\u201cSure.\u201d The salesgirl smiled at him. She wore a pair of gloves before taking out the necklace and handed it over to the man.\u201cHere, Wenwen. Put it on. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll look gorgeous in it.\u201d The man took over the necklace and spoke to the beautiful girl who looked ten years younger than him.\u201cWow, this is lovely!\u201d The girl gazed at the necklace the man was holding with her eyes brightened up.\u201cTry it. If it\u2019s nice, we\u2019ll buy it,\u201d said the middle-aged man with a face full of smiles. To woo the beautiful girl before him, he was ready to throw in his money.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it myself, Uncle.\u201d The beautiful girl nodded.\u201cSure.\u201d He was so happy that he kept nodding his head.As the girl was putting on the necklace, the man turned to look at Wang Xian again. He observed Wang Xian\u2019s dressing from head to toe. With his lips slightly drawn, he asked, \u201cYoung chap, are you buying jewelry for your girlfriend?\u201d\u201cJust looking around.\u201d Wang Xian peered at the man and nodded. He then turned to look at the necklace that the girl was holding.Wang Xian looked at the pearl necklace and smiled. Regardless of the size or color, the pearls on the necklace were not as good as what he had. In fact, they were far more inferior quality.\u201cYoung chap, what is your budget for the jewelry? Young people like you should not be too far-fetched. Buying one that is around one to two thousand will do.\u00a0You should buy according to what you can afford. When you have the money, you can get something more expensive. When I was your age, I was equally poor. But if you work hard in the future and earn big bucks, you can also pursue those expensive items that are over hundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201dThe middle-aged man spoke while looking at the beautiful girl and Wang Xian.Even though it sounded like a reminder from a senior, he was conveying an implicit message to the girl: Young people are poor, and I\u2019m rich.The beautiful girl put on the necklace and peered at Wang Xian before she finally fixed her eyes on the middle-aged man, \u201cDoes it look beautiful on me?\u201d\u201cOf course, you look extremely gorgeous with it. Wenwen, this type of pearl and jade necklace suits you the most. Those that are worth a few thousand dollars don\u2019t match you at all.\u201d The man quickly praised her.\u201cReally?\u201d The beautiful girl was so happy that she could not stop looking at herself in the mirror.\u201cI\u2019m sure. Wenwen, look at how beautiful you are when you are wearing it. Your friends will envy you when they see this,\u201d said the man. Suddenly he turned to Wang Xian and asked, \u201cYoung chap, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s beautiful too?\u201d\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Wang Xian nodded in agreement.\u201cHaha, see! Young chap, you don\u2019t have to envy me. Work hard and earn more money in the future. Till then, you can also get one for your girlfriend,\u201d the middle-aged man patted Wang Xian on his shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that this necklace is the best among all. If there were better ones, I\u2019d buy them for you, Wenwen.\u201d\u201cUncle, you\u2019re so nice to me.\u201d Wenwen looked at himRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHaha, of course, I\u2019m nice to you. Even though I\u2019m slightly old, no young chaps can be comparable to me,\u201d said the middle-aged man confidently.\u201cAhem, Uncle, I have better pearls over here. I wonder if you have any interest in them,\u201d Wang Xian pursed his lips and said. He looked at the man who was diligently \u2018guiding\u2019 and \u2018teaching\u2019 him. In actual fact, the man was trying to bring himself up.This man was a sly fox. He put in good words for himself by stepping on others without being too obvious.Wise men do not cut someone down to size. This fellow not only stepped on others, but he was also stepping on Wang Xian to prove himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You have better pearls?\u201dThe middle-aged man looked at him with doubts and started chuckling soon after. In a demeaning and mocking way, he said, \u201cBrat, do you even know what a pearl is? What are natural and wild pearls? Do you know about the colors and quality differentiation?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t find out about them in the past so I don\u2019t know about that. However, I have some pearls with me and they are indeed better than those pearls this beautiful lady is wearing.\u201dAs he spoke, he took out the pearls from his pocket one after another. \u201cNatural pearls. As for their condition, I\u2019m not too sure about that. Nonetheless, these are definitely much better than yours.\u201d\u201cWhat pearls do you have there?\u201d The middle-aged man saw the pearls in Wang Xian\u2019s hands and was filled with doubt. However, nonchalance was written all over his face. \u201cNatural pearls are valuable treasures. How could yours be real?\u201dWang Xian\u2019s lip was slightly drawn upon hearing what the middle-aged man said. \u201cWe will know once we get them to appraise the pearls.\u201dWang Xian headed over to the service attendant at the cabinet and asked, \u201cDoes this shop collect pearls?\u201dThe service attendant looked at Wang Xian with astonishment. She nodded her head and replied, \u201cYeah we do but we only collect pearls in good condition.\u201d\u201cIn that case, please help me take a look at these and give me an appraisal of the value,\u201d Wang Xian said to the service attendant.\u201cAlright Mister, please wait a minute. I\u2019ll go and get my manager.\u201d The service attendant saw the pearls in his hands and immediately went to the back of the shop to call the manager over.\u201cThese pearls are really huge!\u201d At this moment, the beautiful lady just beside him was looking at the pearls in Wang Xian\u2019s hands in astonishment.Wang Xian smiled and answered carefreely, \u201c20mm. Just slightly larger than those you are wearing. These pearls are round and without flaws. I believe they are worth at least several hundreds of thousands.\u201dThe beautiful lady\u2019s mouth gaped open.The middle-aged man\u2019s face took on a ghastly expression and he said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t even sure if they are real. If they are real, you must be really lucky.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dWang Xian chuckled, \u201cThese are just some pearls. So what if they are real? It\u2019s just several hundreds of thousands.\u201dShowing off! Wang Xian was openly doing it in front of him. As compared to the middle-aged man\u2019s subtle way of doing it, his way was more direct.\u201cSeveral hundreds of thousand is already really expensive,\u201d the beautiful lady beside him commented.\u201cIt isn\u2019t, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just several hundreds of thousands.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head as he remarked. The way he was acting currently was very similar to a property tycoon. \u201cAfter starting my business for some years, I still have some wealth.\u201d\u201cAwesome! To start a business when you are still so young,\u201d the beautiful lady replied in astonishment.This caused the middle-aged man beside her to take on a ghastly expression. What the hell! This ordinarily dressed brat sure is great at boasting.\u201cSir, please let our manager take a look at your pearls.\u201d At this moment, the service attendant walked over and spoke to him.Wang Xian nodded his head and handed the pearls to the female manager on the other side of the cabinet.When the manager took over the pearls from his hands, her face was filled with bewilderment. She immediately took out a magnifying glass to take a closer look.\u201cNatural pearls! These are natural pearls.\u201dThe manager was shocked. After which, she took out a ruler to measure.\u201c20mm natural pearls without any trace of impurities. Round and without any flaws. This is simply unbelievable. These pearls are of the highest quality even among the highest quality pearls.\u201dThe manager couldn\u2019t contain her astonishment.\u201cOf course!\u201d Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised. Wang Xian had checked the value of 20mm natural pearls online and they were really valuable. Moreover, if the pearls were made into a string of necklace, the value would be even higher.\u201cMister, are you looking to sell these pearls?\u201d the manager looked at Wang Xian and askedfrantically.\u201cI\u2019m selling. May I know how much you could offer me?\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The manager frowned. This was the first time she\u2019d seen such precious pearls and therefore she couldn\u2019t determine a price at the moment.\u201c$500k. Mister, are you alright with the offer?\u201d The manager threw out an offer price.\u201c$500k?\u201d When Wang Xian heard this offer price, he was rather satisfied but he didn\u2019t agree to it immediately. \u201cI\u2019m selling quite a few of them. Is it possible to increase the price a little more?\u201d\u201cWhat? Mister, do you have more pearls with such grade?\u201d The manager looked at him with astonishment.Wang Xian smiled and took out all the pearls from his pocket.There were a total of 16 pearls with four white, four black, four gold and four pink pearls.Each pearl was almost the same size and gave off a mesmerizing glow.The manager\u2019s eyes popped wide open. \u201cOh my gosh\u2026 You have so many and every single one of them is of the highest quality.\u201d\u201c16 pearls could be used to make an entire set of pearl jewellery or into a pearl necklace. I believe that the offer price could be increased a little more.\u201d Wang Xian looked at the shocked expression of the manager and spoke with a giggling smile.\u201cWow, these pearls are so beautiful!\u201d The beautiful lady took a look at the pearl and jade jewellery on her before looking at the pearls in Wang Xian\u2019s hand. They were completely of a different grade.\u201cWith so many pearls, wouldn\u2019t it mean that these are worth at least $8 million?\u201d The beautiful lady\u2019s eyes popped wide open and her jaw dropped.Wang Xian glanced at the beautiful lady and middle-aged man and said, \u201cYeah, these are worth at least $8 million. However, if it\u2019s just $8 million, I clearly wouldn\u2019t sell them. Hey uncle, if you are interested and can offer me a suitable price, I can sell them to you.\u201dAs he spoke, the corners of his mouth arced upwards.The middle-aged man couldn\u2019t help but feel his mouth twitching. He had a heavy expression on his face and kept silent.\u201cMister, Deep-sea Jewellery would like to purchase your pearls.\u201d At this moment, the manager got a little flustered upon hearing what Wang Xian said.Top grade pearls had always been in demand but there might not be a supply for it. Moreover, natural pearls were hard to come by. If she could purchase these 16 top grade pearls and make them into a set of jewellery or even just a pearl necklace, it would definitely become the attraction of Deep-sea Jewellery.\u201cMister, please wait a minute. I\u2019m not authorized to make decisions for transactions in the range of over $10 million. Please wait a moment while I report this to the headquarters.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head.\u201cPlease come in.\u201d The manager opened the small door leading to the back of the cabinet in a hurry and said to Wang Xian.\u201cMm.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head. When he walked to the position of the middle-aged man, he paused. He lifted his hand, patted his shoulder and said, \u201cUncle, if you wish to woo a beautiful lady, you\u2019ve got to work hard. After all, there are many rich young men nowadays and you are already so old. Money is one aspect but you have to be sincere too. Hehe.\u201dAs Wang Xian spoke, he put on a demeanor of an elder educating a younger guy. After which, Wang Xian headed to the waiting room in the back of Deep-sea Jewellery shop.Who didn\u2019t know how to show off pompously nowadays? Even if you couldn\u2019t, you would at least know how to boast, right?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever to show off in front of others, one would still need to have some capital. Wang Xian believed that he still had the capital to do so currently.Whoever wishes to show off in front of me has to assess themselves first.The middle-aged man was extremely displeased. After seeing Wenwen who seemed to be hesitating, his displeasure was even more apparent.After all, he was already over 40 years old. The only advantage he had was that he had family assets of more than $10 million.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ll just wait here. No hurry.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dWang Xian made himself comfortable in the waiting room as he felt funny when he thought of the middle-aged man whom he\u2019d met just now.\u201cIs the seller inside?\u201dAfter 20 minutes, Wang Xian heard a girl from the outside.\u201cSir, sorry to keep you waiting. This is our in-charge from the company.\u201dJust then, a pretty girl who was in professional attire followed behind the manager as the manager introduced her to Wang Xian.\u201cHi.\u201d Wang Xian stood up and stretched out his hand.\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dWang Xian gasped as he looked at the familiar girl in front of him.The girl before him was slightly shocked to see Wang Xian too.\u201cWang Xian?\u201d she raised her eyebrows and asked.\u201cChairman Lan!\u201dWang Xian did not expect an acquaintance to be here. Moreover, she was a senior in the school \u2013 Lan Qingyue.Lan Qingyue was the vice-chairman of the student council at the University of Rivertown. Wang Xian had met her a few times before.However, Lan Qingyue was not expecting Wang Xian to be the seller who wanted to sell the premium grade pearls.She knew a fair bit about Wang Xian.He was a year-one student, and they\u2019d met a few times when he was looking for some part-time jobs in school.She remembered the guy in front of her was working for the entire year, even during his school holiday.He part-timed in school and outside of school too.For quite some time, as the vice-chairman of the student council, she took on the chairman role for the students\u2019 affairs club and was responsible for the part-time work in school.Back then, Wang Xian was part-timing non-stop. So, she was quite familiar with his family\u2019s situation.His parents were not around, and he was left living with his younger sister. Hence, he had to be responsible for his sister\u2019s livelihood. Back at that time, Lan Qingyue had a deep impression of him as she had due respect for this guy.\u201cWhat a coincidence!\u201d Wang Xian grinned and said to her.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cDirector Lan, do you know this gentleman?\u201d the manager asked in astonishment.\u201cSchoolmates.\u201d Lan Qingyue nodded with a smile.\u201cThat will be even better, Director Lan. Both of you take a seat, and I\u2019ll get you some water,\u201d said the manager quickly.\u201cThe rumors in the school are real.\u201dUpon seeing the manager\u2019s attitude, Wang Xian thought of the rumors in the school saying that her family owned a significant listed company, and they were an affluent family. In the future, she would be taking over the large-scale family business.But he did not expect that she was already handling her family business before she turned year three.\u201cWang Xian, I never expected you would be the seller,\u201d said Lan Qingyue indifferently to Wang Xian.Wang Xian chuckled and checked out Lan Qingyue who was in office attire. She gave off a cool and distant vibe.She had a great figure, but she was the type who seemed remote and aloof. In school, she was known as the Ice Queen.She and Guan Shuqing were two different characters. Guan Shuqing was a goddess that was friendly yet reserved.But Lan Qingyue was a goddess who kept her distance at arm\u2019s length.\u201cI was not expecting you either.\u201d\u201cCan you show me the pearls?\u201d Lan Qingyue peered at the pearl on the table.\u201cOf course.\u201d Wang Xian nodded and showed her.Lan Qingyue placed four pearls of different colors in her palm.\u201cThis is gorgeous!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201c16 pearls could make one or two sets of jewelry or a string of necklace.\u201d\u201cI wonder how much you are asking for,\u201d asked Lan Qingyue.\u201cName me your price.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and replied.\u201cHow about $600,000 for one?\u201d Lan Qingyue asked with a grin.\u201cDeal.\u201d Wang Xian nodded without asking for a higher price, as $600,000 for a pearl was already a remarkable price.16 pearls would bring him $9.6 million. With the $1.75 million that he had, he would have over $10 million in total.Within a few days, Wang Xian turned into a millionaire!\u201cI thought you would raise your price.\u201d Lan Qingyue was a little stunned by Wang Xian\u2019s unconditional agreement. \u201cYou are making me uneasy. Let\u2019s make it a round sum, $10 million.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d Wang Xian laughed and nodded.\u201cCan I ask where you got these pearls from?\u201d Lan Qingyue asked with her curiosity piqued.\u201cFrom the sea,\u201d Wang Xian answered with a grin. \u201cIf I have more pearls in the future, I\u2019ll come and look for you.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Upon hearing that, Lan Qingyue was slightly stunned. Can pearls be found so easily?\u201cLet\u2019s add each other on Wechat. I will look for you when I have more pearls,\u201d Wang Xian told her.\u201cGreat!\u201d Lan Qingyue nodded and smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the bank to transfer the money.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Wang Xian nodded and followed her out. The maximum limit for online bank transfers was set at five million. Hence, they needed to go to the bank to do a transfer instead.Before they could exit through the door, three juveniles walked into Deep-sea Jewelry. Three of them were wearing formal clothing in the summer. When they saw Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue, they exchanged gazes with each other.\u201cDon\u2019t move and don\u2019t make a noise. Otherwise, I will kill both of you.\u201dSuddenly, the three of them aimed black handguns drawn out from their pockets at them.Lan Qingyue and Wang Xian were stunned immediately as they looked ghastly at them.\u201cClose the store now! Hurry! Otherwise, I\u2019ll kill both of you immediately.\u201dOne of them pointed the handgun at one of the salesgirl\u2019s head.\u201cAh!\u201dThat salesgirl raised her hands shockingly. All the salespeople and the manager behind the counters in the shop got a fright.\u201cStop screaming and close the door now. Don\u2019t think of staying alive if the police are here.\u201dThat juvenile barked ferociously at everyone.\u201cNo, don\u2019t kill me.\u201d The salesgirl walked to the door and shut it while shuddering in fear.There were no other customers in the store at this time except for six salesgirls and a manager. Once the door was closed, people from the outside had a limited view of whatever happened in the shop.\u201cSquat down on the floor. Hurry.\u201d The robber who was pointing his gun at Wang Xian shouted to everyone.Wang Xian was slightly stupefied as he did not expect he would encounter a robbery. After all, robbery was not a common thing in modern day.\u201cSquat down!\u201d The robber in front of Wang Xian barked at him again.Wang Xian looked at the shiny black muzzle and squatted down.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLan Qingyue squatted down and stared at the three robbers with a horrified look on her face.\u201cQuick, take all the jewelry now.\u201dA robber pointed the handgun towards Wang Xian and the rest of the people.\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d The other robber took out a hammer hidden in his clothes and smashed the glass counters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ll get it.\u201d This robber seemed to be very wary of the young man who\u2019d shouted at him previously. With a hideous look on his face, he reached out and grabbed towards Lan Qingyue. \u201cIf you resist any further, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Lan Qingyue had completely lost her usual cold demeanor. She protected the jade pendant around her neck helplessly and seemed determined to protect something extremely important in her heart.\u201cDamn it. You are seeking your own death.\u201d The robber reached over directly and grabbed towards Lan Qingyue\u2019s neck.

However, after the pain sensation subsided, he didn\u2019t feel any misery.\u201cMy body can withstand bullets.\u201dWang Xian was surprised. The reason why he wasn\u2019t taking action was because the other parties had guns with them. He was afraid that with the durability of his body, it would still be insufficient to withstand a bullet attack.\u201cDon\u2019t move, don\u2019t move.\u201d He said softly to Lan Qingyue in his arms.\u201cYou\u2026 Are you alright, Wang Xian?\u201d Tears were streaming down Lan Qingyue\u2019s face.

Given that he owned a dragon body, he should be fully recovered in one to two days.\u201cDirector Lan, put this on.\u201d The manager quickly took off his jacket and put it on her when he saw the clothes on Lan Qingyue were torn.\u201cOkay,\u201d Lan Qingyue stood up and walked to Wang Xian, \u201cAre you really all right? I saw they shot at you. Let me check your back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Their guns might be fake. The impact wasn\u2019t as powerful.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and shook his head.\u201cLet me see it.\u201d Lan Qingyue checked his back and spotted the blood stains on his white shirt. She covered her mouth, \u201cIt\u2019s bleeding. I\u2019ll call the ambulance. You have to get to the hospital now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Wang Xian shook his head again and bared his back, \u201cLook, it\u2019s okay. I guess it\u2019s just a slight tear.\u201d\u201cYes, he is fine. Just a slight tear.\u201d Captain Li took a look and told one of the security guards, \u201cCall the police now and send them to the station. Manager Huang, check if you have any losses.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad that you are fine.\u201d Lan Qingyue was scared stiff as it was her first encounter with a robbery. She felt her heart warming as she looked at the fit and muscular back. She could not stop thinking about the hug just now.\u201cWe will do the bank transfer tomorrow then. Go back and get some rest.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine. I better accompany you to the hospital for a check-up. I hope your wound won\u2019t get any infection.\u201d Lan Qingyue shook her head.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The injuries I got from my childhood times were even more serious than this. It was fine then,\u201d Wang Xian shook his head and pointed at her clothes. \u201cYou should get some rest. Your clothes\u2026\u201dLan Qingyue looked down at her clothes and blushed, \u201cI will get the company to transfer the money to you today.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Wang Xian was not afraid that Lan Qingyue or Deep-sea Jewelry would repudiate the payment. He saved her and her company big time today. He believed they would not decline to pay that $10 million to him.\u201cI still have something going on. Got to go. You better get some rest,\u201d said Wang Xian to Lan Qingyue. He waved his hand and walked out.\u201cDirector Lan, I\u2019ve already reported this to the CEO. They will be arriving soon,\u201d Manager Huang walked over and told Lan Qingyue. \u201cThey are worried for you.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Lan Qingyue acknowledged briefly as she watched Wang Xian leaving.Manager Huang followed her gaze and looked over. She sighed softly when she thought of the courageous moment performed by the young man just now.If she were any younger, she would also fall for the young and suave man who saved and shielded her from a bullet.Buzz!Just then, Lan Qingyue\u2019s phone rang. Upon seeing her mother\u2019s call, she picked up immediately.\u201cWhat luck I have for encountering a robbery when I\u2019m here just to sell my pearls.\u201dAfter Wang Xian walked out from the jewelry store, he shook his head.However, the fact that his body could block a bullet caught him by surprise.That was a bullet!\u201cIf I can block a bullet when I\u2019m only at Level Two, does that mean I can defend from a sniper rifle or a grenade when I\u2019m at Level Three or Four. Then if I\u2019m at Level Eight or Nine, will I survive a bomb? I have not even attained the First Transformation yet. If I did, wouldn\u2019t I be invincible?\u201dWang Xian was thrilled over it. The mightiness of the Divine Dragon\u2019s body beyond his expectations.\u201cI wonder where that robber drew his mighty strength from, and what Martial Artists he was talking about?\u201d Wang Xian suddenly thought of the things that the robber had just said. \u201cCould there be Martial Artists in this world?\u201dWang Xian pondered to himself. He looked around and walked to a shopping mall.Su Nan Shopping Mall was a large and grand shopping mall that acted as a landmark in the city center. Wang Xian was ready to splurge in the mall.He did not have just $1.7 million, but he had $11.7 million now. Even though he has yet to receive the $10 million, it was a done deal.\u201cI want to change my phone to the latest model and get three sets of branded clothes.\u201dWang Xian walked into a few renowned branded shops and spent more than $50,000 on three sets of clothes.\u201cTime to go back.\u201dWang Xian looked at the things he\u2019d bought with a satisfied face.He walked out and rode his Harley motorcycle back to school.Even though a Harley motorcycle looks cool, it isn\u2019t convenient at all. Should I get a driving license and buy a car?Wang Xian looked at the shopping bags that were hanging on the bike and thought to himself.Forget it, I think I better improve my strength. It\u2019s a waste of time learning how to drive.Wang Xian threw his clothes on the bed and dumped all his old clothes away after he came back to his room.Buzz.Just then, the phone rang. Wang Xian opened the message sent by his younger sister.\u201cBrother, I just knocked off, and I\u2019m bored. Xiao Mi went for her driving lesson and left me alone.\u201d\u201cDriving lesson?\u201d Wang Xian saw his sister\u2019s message and got an idea. \u201cLittle Sis, you can take driving lessons too. I\u2019ll transfer you the money for it.\u201dAs he said this, he transferred $10,000 over to her.\u201cBrother, why did you transfer so much money to me? Where did you get the money from? I\u2019m not learning to drive!\u201dXiao Yu saw the $10,000 that her brother had transferred to her and got a shock.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI earned some money over here. You can take driving lessons with Xiao Mi. I\u2019ll wait for you to drive me around.\u201dWang Xian said this to dismiss her sister. He did not tell her the truth.He wanted to buy her a car when she arrived at school.A branded car.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hehe.\u201dAfter staying in the dormitory room for an hour plus, Wang Xian received a message from Guan Shuqing saying that she definitely had to give him a treat today.Wang Xian agreed to it. After the outdoor cooking the previous day, the relationship between the two of them was clearly no longer just about friendship.Wang Xian changed into a set of fine clothing. The pair of white casual shorts and black short sleeve t-shirts cost $10k each.However, these weren\u2019t the most extravagant pieces. Wang Xian also took out the Nike shoes that cost $800k.This pair of Nike shoes was the Nike MAG; Back to the Future 2, a limited release worldwide.He got these shoes from the young man riding the heavy-duty motorcycle, who had bought them overseas to show off to others.In the end, the shoes fell into Wang Xian\u2019s hands. Wang Xian had initially wanted to sell them. However, since he had the money currently, he no longer had to sell them and could wear them himself.This pair of shoes was not just filled with technology. Moreover, the design was great and extremely comfortable.It was also a great match for Wang Xian\u2019s clothes.After changing into the new clothes and being modified by dragon energy, Wang Xian had a unique aura around him.After parking his Harley at one side of the road, Wang Xian waited by the school gate.Guan Shuqing found a translation job and was about to knock off from work right now. She had asked him to wait for her at the school gate for a moment.\u201cHuh?\u201d At this moment, Wang Xian heard screams of shock. He turned his head over and his attention landed on a girl in front of him.The girl was wearing a white dress and carrying a LV bag. She had makeup on her face, had a great figure and could be considered very beautiful.As compared to before, her dressing was more fashionable. She was none other than the girl who Wang Xian was once fond of, Qi Chuchu.Qi Chuchu also noticed Wang Xian and looked at him with astonishment.As compared to the quiet and ordinarily dressed guy, in her opinion, the current Wang Xian was better dressed.Moreover, he was emitting a unique aura.\u201cHe\u2019s just wearing some $10 new clothing.\u201d Qi Chuchu thought to herself reluctantly.\u201cWhat are you doing here? You don\u2019t have to work?\u201dQi Chuchu adjusted her LV bag and beautiful dress while speaking plainly to Wang Xian.\u201cI\u2019m waiting for someone.\u201d Wang Xian smiled at here and was clearly no longer interested in her.As compared to Guan Shuqing, Qi Chuchu was a far distance behind.\u201cOh, what a coincidence. I\u2019m also waiting for someone.\u201d Qi Chuchu glanced at Wang Xian and a smile appeared gradually on her face. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for my boyfriend to come and fetch me.\u201dSeeing that Wang Xian wasn\u2019t replying to him, she got a little angered. \u201cDon\u2019t you have work today?\u201d\u201cNope, I already have enough money to spend.\u201d Wang Xian smiled.\u201cEnough?\u201d When Qi Chuchu heard his words, her face was filled with belittling and deprecating vibes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that your sister would be attending the same school and you will let her lead a comfortable university life? Do you know how expensive this bag is? How expensive the makeup cosmetic products are? Just the bag in my hand will cost more than $10 thousand.\u201dAs she spoke, she flicked her hair with a strong sense of superiority.When she was talking, three to four young men were also waiting for others at the same location.They took a glance at Qi Chuchu before looking at Wang Xian.\u201cAs long as I have sufficient money to spend, it will be fine for me. As for the bag, as long as it can be used, I\u2019m fine with it.\u201d After hearing the deprecating words of Qi Chuchu, Wang Xian just smiled faintly.\u201cEvery girl would hope to be able to buy bags they like and makeup cosmetics.\u201d Qi Chuchu laughed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t really a qualified brother!\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and didn\u2019t bother to entertain the materialistic Qi Chuchu. Looking at a materialistic girl like her now, she looked more like a clown.When the group of young men heard what Qi Chuchu said, they were slightly shocked. A young man pointed at Wang Xian\u2019s shoes and mumbled to his companions.His other two companions looked over and were shocked. After which, they took a closer look at Wang Xian\u2019s clothes.\u201cThat\u2019s a Harley Heavy-duty motorcycle. It\u2019s a Harley! So cool.\u201dAt this moment, the group of young men saw the Harley motorcycles behind Wang Xian. They couldn\u2019t help but reveal their fondness for the vehicle.\u201cIt\u2019s too cool. This Harley probably costs at least a few hundred thousand.\u201d\u201cEh, nope nope. This Harley has been specially modified and should be a custom made version. Custom made Harley is even more expensive. Harley Electra Glide is sold at over $400k on the official website. A special custom version would definitely be more expensive. I\u2019ve got a friend who had one custom made and it cost over $800k. However, that is still a far cry from this.\u201d\u201cIn that case, wouldn\u2019t this be over a million?\u201dThe group of young men walked over in awe and were exclaiming as they looked.Qi Chuchu heard what they said and turned her head over in astonishment. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201dWang Xian noticed that there were a few people crowding around his ride. A smile appeared on his face.\u201cA heavy-duty motorcycle is cool but still couldn\u2019t be compared with a car,\u201d he said faintly.\u201cTsk, what do you know about these?\u201d Qi Chuchu heard what he said and looked at him with disdain. \u201cYou will never be able to afford a car like this.\u201dWang Xian chuckled upon hearing what she said. The group of young men also looked over with surprise.\u201cMy boyfriend is here. Where are you going, do you need a ride?\u201d Qi Chuchu saw a BMW 5 Series car driving towards her and spoke in a deprecating manner at Wang Xian.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201cChuchu.\u201d At this moment, the BMW stopped by the side. A young man that looked just slightly over 20 years old stepped out. He looked a little skinny and weak and his complexion was a little pale. What\u2019s more prominent was that he had a protruded mouth and an ape-like chin. To sum it up, he looked a little ugly.The young man walked over and opened his arms slightly for an embrace.\u201cBrother Qing.\u201d Qi Chuchu walked over and hugged the young man directly. At the same time, she gave him a kiss.\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d the young man wrapped his arms around Qi Chuchu\u2019s waist and asked with a smile.\u201cJust a guy who tried to woo me in the past. Tsk. Aiming for someone completely out of his league.\u201d Qi Chuchu pouted slightly and giggled.\u201cOh?\u201d That young man looked at Wang Xian and took out a cigarette. He looked at Wang Xian with disdain and said, \u201cHey brother, do you have the capability to go after Chuchu?\u201dWang Xian saw the young man talking to him and was slightly shocked. A cold smirk appeared on his face. He looked at the BMW 5 Series before looking at his shoes.A faint mocking expression surfaced on his face.When the group of young men heard the conversation, they were shocked too. When they heard what the girl said previously, they were already a little surprised. Right now, they were completely stunned.They looked at that BMW before looking at the shoes of Wang Xian.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI recalled a scene suddenly.\u201dA young man saw his other two companions pointing to the BMW suddenly before pointing to Wang Xian\u2019s shoes.\u201cCan you remember the day I asked you out to play? I was wearing Nikes. When you appeared, you turned around and left with a guy with trendy clothes and driving a BMW 5 series. What you might not know is that his car is worth $600k but my Nikes are worth $810k.\u201dThe voice of the young man was loud and clear and everyone could hear it. It was especially so as the young man was pointing his finger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Qi Chuchu was also dumbstruck as she could not believe her ears.Wang Xian looked at them impassively before he saw Guan Shuqing walking towards him. He immediately grinned and waved to her.\u201cSorry to keep you waiting.\u201dGuan Shuqing scampered over and saw the zestful and good-looking Wang Xian. A faint smile surfaced on her face.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I just got here too.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head.\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll treat you to dinner in the old street.\u201d Guan Shuqing beamed at Wang Xian as she spoke.\u201cSure, anything would do,\u201d Wang Xian nodded. \u201cI\u2019m riding a motorcycle.\u201dWang Xian headed to the Harley motorcycle and unlocked it with a key.\u201cWow, a Harley motorcycle. Looks like you\u2019re really rich.\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at him with astonishment.She thought Wang Xian might be making some money, but it was less expected that he would be rich enough to afford a Harley motorcycle.\u201cSomeone gave it to me. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a car license yet. So, I could only ride this motorcycle.\u201dWang Xian grinned, \u201cDo you mind sitting behind?\u201d\u201cHehe, you are not using this motorcycle for wooing girls, right?\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at him and teased him.But, she went on to sit at the back.Wang Xian chuckled and replied, \u201cI guess to woo girls with this is not as effective as a BMW.\u201d\u201cHehe,\u201d Guan Shuqing laughed, \u201cLet\u2019s go and have some meat skewers.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Wang Xian nodded. He started the engine and rode towards the old street.Guan Shuqing stared at the back of the guy in front of her. With some hesitation, she held his waist.\u201cCool, he is so freaking cool!\u201d\u201cThat pair of shoes and the Harley motorcycle are about 2 million dollars. He\u2019s loaded.\u201d\u201cI envy him. He\u2019s actually wearing a pair of shoes that is $800,000. Such a filthy rich man.\u201dThe three juveniles looked at the Harley motorcycle that took off. Slowly, they shifted their focus to Qi Chuchu and the other young man.Flaunting your BMW? The price of your BMW is incomparable to that one pair of shoes.Just now, the girl even told the young guy to stop dreaming about riding a Harley.That young man also told him that he did not have the capital.Now, that was a slap in their faces!He had a pair of shoes that was worth $700,000 to $800,000 and a Harley motorcycle that could easily cost a million. You guys still mocked him and asked if he has the capital?At the same time, Qi Chuchu put on a different expression as she watched in disbelief as the Harley motorcycle zoomed off.\u201cHow could he be loaded?\u201d Qi Chuchu did not want to believe it. He was just a poor lad. How did he boost his wealth all of a sudden? And that girl just now. Wasn\u2019t she the famous belle, Guan Shuqing?\u201dWas he hiding his identity of a son from a wealthy family?Regrets\u2026 Deepest regrets.The young man observed the peculiar gazes from the three of them at the side with a sullen face. He was infuriated when he looked at Qi Chuchu with a face full of regret. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the hotel.\u201dA calm and peaceful encounter with Qi Chuchu was over. Not the slightest tinge of yearning was left. Instead, he detested her.After dinner, he sent Guan Shuqing back to her dormitory. Wang Xian looked at the moon and the stars that were shining brightly in the sky. He made up his mind to head out for the sea.\u201cI want to improve my strength and make myself even more powerful.\u201dWhen he\u2019d learned that his body could resist a bullet this afternoon, Wang Xian decided to upgrade his strength as soon as possible so that he could grow stronger.He did not ride his motorcycle. Instead, he took a cab outside of the school.When he arrived at the beach, it was already 9 pm. Wang Xiang watched the glistening waves under the moonlight.He found a remote spot, took off his clothes, and jumped into the sea.Transform into a dragon.With a thought in his mind, he dived into the sea.As a new-born dragon, he had no ability yet. To possess those Superpowers like Wind, Rain, Thunder, and Lightning would require the exchange with the Dragon Energy.Dragon Race needed to cultivate for Superpowers and their physical body.In Divine Dragon Transformation, there were Conversion Techniques for various attributes.Dragon Energy could convert to wind, rain, and even thunder and lightning.However, a mighty Divine Dragon would use Dragon Energy to upgrade his body into Wind Physique, Water Physique and Inferno Physique and many more.After upgrading to Wind Physique or Water Physique, the attributes attacks would be much more powerful. With mighty physiques and invincible attributes, Divine Dragons would become the most powerful race in the universe.Divine Dragons were also divided as Wind Divine Dragon, Fire Divine Dragon, Earth Divine Dragon, Thunder Divine Dragon, and so on.Among all the Conversion Techniques of the Divine Dragon Transformation, he had yet to decide his cultivation direction in the future.However, Wang Xian could enhance his body parts using Dragon Energy. For example, he could use the Dragon Energy to strengthen his claws or upgrade his eyes.As a Divine Dragon, the darkness at night could never blind his vision.Wang Xian dived into the sea and swam to the far end.The ocean at night was as lively as it was in the day. Various fish and sea creatures were swimming in the sea.To the fish, there was no day and night. In fact, most of the fish were active and hunting for food at night.At Level Two, Wang Xian was not weak in his strength. Because of his mighty physical body and the power of a Divine Dragon, even a sea creature at Level Three would not be his match.But if he saw a shark, he would not be able to outfight it. To devour marine life like the shark, he would need to wait until he advanced to Level Four.For marine life such as Killer Whales, he would need to advance to at least a Level Five or Level Six.Perhaps there are many other mysterious yet daunting marine animals in the vast ocean, Wang Xian thought to himself. He fixed his eyes on a grouper. With a jerk, he swam over and swallowed it.\u201cBohai Sea has too little schools of fish. If there is a large school of fish in the ocean, my strength will improve quickly.\u201dWang Xian had been hunting, gobbling up the fish and converting them into Dragon Energy in the area.But, the resources in the ocean were not abundant. Due to the wild hunting of the marine animals in the country, the resources were insufficient.\u201cEh, there are hundreds of salmon ahead.\u201dWang Xian came to the spot where the Clam Girl was situated when he saw the school of salmon. He swam speedily and devoured them all at once.\u201cDragon King!\u201dSensing his arrival, the Clam Girl opened up her clamshell, revealing her clam flesh.Clam Girl: Level SixArt of Cultivation: Water Dragon TransformationRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuperpower: NoneAfter the Clam Girl became his subordinate, Wang Xian could read more information about her. The Clam Girl who was practicing her Water Dragon Transformation would become a strong existence for controlling the water element.\u201cContinue with your cultivation.\u201dThe Clam Girl had just started her cultivation not long before. Hence, there were not many changes to her. Wang Xian left his instruction with her and swam off to other surrounding areas to continue his hunting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wasn\u2019t very lucky the previous night as he did not encounter any school of fish like a school of ribbonfish. Therefore, he had only managed to increase his Dragon Energy by 700 points in a night.Feeling his body getting stronger, a faint smile appeared on his face.\u201cSince I got stronger, I don\u2019t even feel that sleepy. However, the hunger still remains.\u201dWang Xian still couldn\u2019t survive without food at the moment. He swam to the shore, put on his clothes and leapt onto the road easily.If there\u2019s anyone who saw this scene, their jaw would have definitely dropped. This was because Wang Xian jumped over four meters with a single leap!Luckily, there weren\u2019t many people in the vicinity in the morning.\u201cThere should be some places selling breakfast ahead.\u201dWang Xian looked at the surroundings and thought to himself. There\u2019s a seaside holiday resort right ahead. During this hot summer, it would simply be a luxury experience to be able to spend one\u2019s holiday there.This resort was rather famous and the food and accommodations in it were rather luxurious.Naturally, the expenses would also be very high.After passing by the entrance of this Summer Sun Resort, Wang Xian looked ahead of him and discovered a few roadside stalls. There were already quite a number of people having breakfast around.Wang Xian walked over and saw a stall selling deep-fried pancakes. He asked directly, \u201cBoss, please give me five dollars of deep-fried pancakes and a bowl of soup.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, son, we have sold out,\u201d replied the boss of the stall with a smile.\u201cSo early?\u201d Wang Xian was a little surprised.\u201cIt\u2019s almost nine in the morning now. Moreover, there are more people working by the seaside recently,\u201d the boss explained.Wang Xian nodded his head and headed to the stall just beside it.After asking several stalls which gave similar replies, he felt a little helpless about the situation.\u201cBoss, do you still have some buns?\u201d Wang Xian arrived at the last stall selling buns and asked the boss.\u201cYeah, we have one last serving. Son, you are really lucky!\u201d The boss smiled at him.\u201cThat\u2019s great. Give me a serving of buns and a bowl of soup,\u201d Wang Xian replied before walking in and sitting down.\u201cAlright, please wait a minute,\u201d shouted the boss.\u201cThe money has been transferred in.\u201d Wang Xian took out his phone and saw the notification messages. He suddenly got a little agitated.Ten million. It\u2019s ten million. The money for the pearls sold just yesterday!The edge of his mouth arched upwards.\u201cBoss, do you still have some buns?\u201d At this moment, two middle-aged men walked in.A slightly plump middle-aged man asked the boss.The middle-aged boss looked at the two men before replying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Misters, the last serving of buns has been ordered by that young man in the stall.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The slightly plump man frowned.\u201cBoss, what do you think about selling us this last serving of bun? We are willing to offer a higher price.\u201d At this moment, the other middle-aged man, who was standing beside the plump middle-aged men, asked the boss.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The boss felt a little uncomfortable about the idea. He shook his head and replied, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right. He ordered it first after all.\u201d\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there any more breakfast?\u201d The slightly plump middle-aged man grumbled unhappily.\u201cDirector Li. It will be fine. Leave this to me. Just leave this to me.\u201d The plump middle-aged man seemed to be eager to get on the good books of the other middle-aged man. He turned his attention to Wang Xian who was sitting in the stall.He walked forward directly into the stall and took out $100 from his pocket.\u201cHey, pal.\u201d The middle-aged man walked beside him. Wang Xian lifted his head, feeling a little surprised.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cHey, pal, I\u2019ll like to buy the last serving of buns for $100!\u201d said the middle-aged man as he placed the red cash note on the table in front of Wang Xian.Wang Xian was slightly shocked. Looking at the $100 note, he kept his silence and simply smiled.This serving of buns had cost him eight dollars. If it was like before, he would definitely agree to the suggestion happily. This was because he didn\u2019t have money in the past.As for now, he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to go hungry for just $100.Wang Xian shook his head and replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not selling.\u201dThe middle-aged man was surprised. He frowned and took out another $100 note from his pocket. \u201c$200!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not selling.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head.\u201cHuh?\u201d The middle-aged man was clearly displeased at this point. He took out another $100 note and remarked, \u201c$300. I\u2019m not offering any higher!\u201dWang Xian lifted his head and looked at the gold necklace around the middle-aged man\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019m not selling no matter what you are offering me.\u201d\u201cYou little brat\u2026\u201d The middle-aged man had a ghastly expression upon hearing Wang Xian\u2019s reply.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mr. Song?\u201d Director Li walked into the stall and asked the middle-aged man with a dissatisfied tone.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Director Li. I\u2019m offering this brat money but he isn\u2019t willing to sell.\u201d The middle-aged turned his head over and explained embarrassingly.\u201cIsn\u2019t this area managed by Zhang Qianyuan?\u201d Director Li remarked in a plain tone while looking at Wang Xian. He found Wang Xian a little familiar.\u201cExcuse me, Misters.\u201d At this point, the boss carried the bun and walked over.When the middle-aged man heard what Director Li said, he understood the meaning behind it immediately. He looked at the boss of the stall and said coldly, \u201cBoss, this area should be under Zhang Qianyuan, right? Do you need me to give Zhang Qianyuan a call?\u201dThe boss was stunned for a moment when he heard the name of \u201cZhang Qianyuan\u201d. He immediately asked timidly, \u201cIs there anything I can help you guys with?\u201d\u201cOur Director Li hasn\u2019t got his breakfast,\u201d the middle-aged man replied before looking at Director Li who was beside him. \u201cDirector Li, please take a seat here.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Director Li nodded his head and sat in the seat to the right of Wang Xian.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The boss was at a loss. Zhang Qianyuan was in charge of this street. Some of the facilities of this area had been modified by him. Anyone who wished to set up a stall here had to submit rentals to him. Although this place might look deserted, business here was great. Therefore this was a great place to do business for him and allowed him to feed his entire family.The two middle-aged men weren\u2019t dressed like ordinary guys and had come in a luxurious car, which was parked right outside. For them to be able to call out Zhang Qianyuan\u2019s name, they should have some relationships between them.\u201cThis\u2026 Son.\u201d The boss was fearful of offending the other party and turned to Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression. \u201cSon, this\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Let me get some rice for you\u2026 For free\u2026 Are you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201dWang Xian saw how the boss was acting and was clearly displeased. The boss was clearly wary of the influence these two guys had and would like to give the bun to these two middle-aged men.He didn\u2019t blame the boss for this and just kept his vision on the middle-aged man and Director Li beside him.He recognized this Director Li, as he was the boss of First-grade Seafood Restaurant. When Guan Shuqing had accidentally knocked over the arowana, he almost beat Guan Shuqing up in a fit of anger.If it wasn\u2019t for Wang Xian previously, the consequences for Guan Shuqing would be hard to imagine.With regard to Director Li, Wang Xian didn\u2019t have a good impression of him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe was even trying to use his influence to bully others over a serving of buns.\u201cIt\u2019s alright boss. Just get me a bowl of rice. You can give them the bun,\u201d Wang Xian said to the boss and didn\u2019t make things difficult for him.\u201cAlright, thank you, son. Thank you.\u201d The boss nodded his head in gratitude as he thanked Wang Xian.\u201cI was offering you $300 previously and yet you weren\u2019t willing to sell.

He was a tit-for-tat person.The middle-aged man scorned at Wang Xian. Subsequently, he bowed and scraped as he passed the pair of chopsticks to Director Li. \u201cDirector Li, please have it. I had my breakfast. You reaped quite an amount of fish in your farm. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll sign the contract with the two countries in East Asia today.\u201d\u201cHeh, it\u2019s way within my expectation. Otherwise, I would not have loaned $20 million just to set up the fishery,\u201d said Director Li with an indifferent tonality. But his expression was full of complacency.\u201cThis time, your profits will double. You\u2019re my boss from now on,\u201d the middle-aged man quickly added on.\u201cSure, Xiao Zhao, I guarantee you that you will not lose out if you follow me. This year, the fishery will produce at least 300,000 kilograms of goods. The export price is $60 per 500 grams. That would be $36 million. After deducting costs and manpower, the profits can hit around $20 million. Your small little fish pond can expand after today.\u201d Director Li nodded with pride.\u201cYes, Director Li. I\u2019ll follow you after this year. You got your investment capital back just within a year. That\u2019s awesome!\u201d\u201cHeh, oh, right. Have you found a channel for my seafood? I am short on premium seafood supply in the First-grade Restaurant. The last supply channel was gone, and the school will reopen soon. The current situation doesn\u2019t look optimistic. This will tarnish my brand name. Besides, there is another high-class seafood restaurant opened beside me. Obviously, they want to steal my business.\u201d\u201cDirector Li, leave this to me. I\u2019ll help you find one since I know the people from the fish market. Just leave it to me. The newly opened seafood restaurant will never surpass your First-grade Restaurant.\u201dFishery? Fish farms? Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he eavesdropped on their conversation about the fishery. He pondered to himself.He put down the rice bowl, took out his phone and began to search for Rivertown Fish Farms.\u201cOh, there are fish farms over here, and they are nearby.\u201d Wang Xian studied the information on his phone with a ray of sharp radiance flashing in his eyes.He spun and looked at Director Li and that middle-aged man with his lips slightly drawn.They quickly finished their meals and headed out.Wang Xian stood up and followed them.\u201cYoung man, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d When Wang Xian was at the door paying two bucks, the boss of the stall apologized to him.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Wang Xian gestured. When he saw Director Li and the middle-aged man get in the Audi Q7, he quickly asked, \u201cBoss, do you know where the nearest fishery is?\u201d\u201cFishery?\u201d The boss was slightly stunned as he pointed in a direction in front of them, \u201cThe fishery zones in the Rivertown can be found 700 to 800 meters ahead.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you!\u201dWang Xian nodded as he beamed. The Audi was already gone in the direction that the boss had pointed out.Wang Xian immediately followed in the same direction.These two days, Wang Xian had never been there before as he always went out to the sea for hunting. Hence, he did not notice the fish farm.Wang Xian sped up. True enough, he spotted Director Li\u2019s car parked along the roadside at the turning point 1,000 meters away.He walked over and spotted the fish farms with nets all over the sea.However, there was a protruding spot not far from there.That region extended out to the land with a surface area of 40 hectares which was equivalent to a mini inland sea.However, the region was surrounded by purse seine and other materials so as to form the best geographical location for the fishery.At this time, Director Li and the middle-aged man were standing at the shore, surrounded by a group of workers.A few fishing boats were parked within the fishery. From a distance, he could vaguely see various types of fish.\u201cThere are so many fish here.\u201dWang Xian fixed his astonished eyes on the fishery.\u201cThis is the fishery that belongs to that Director Li. According to what he said, there are 300,000 kilograms of fish over here.\u201d 300,000 kilograms. That is enough for him to advance to the next level.Wang Xian was thrilled, but a cold-looking expression surfaced on his face. With a swift movement, he headed to the sea at the back.He found a remote spot to take off his clothes and entered the sea.Transform into a dragon.As he moved, the golden Divine Dragon of one meter long swished his dragon tail and headed swiftly to the location where the fisheries were.\u201cThere are many fish varieties in each fishery.\u201dWang Xian swam around and passed by many fisheries. But he did not enter to devour the fish.The owners of these fisheries did not offend him. Wang Xian would not harm anyone else just to advance his levels.He still had basic moral principles.However, he would not spare that fishery of Director Li.Soon, Wang Xian swam to the side of that fishery. Through the water, he could see Director Li and the middle-aged man on the shore.\u201cEh? They actually used steel wire mesh.\u201dWang Xian saw the row of steel wire mesh at the opening that prevented the fish from escaping.Wang Xian chuckled softly. He stretched out his claws and slammed it hard on the mesh.Kakaka!Soon, the steel wire mesh was broken, and Wang Xian entered.\u201cVoila!\u201dLarge Yellow Croaker: Level 0Extractable Dragon Energy: 0.08When he just entered the farm, he saw a Yellow Croaker of about 1 kilogram.A smile surfaced on his face. As Wang Xian emanated his Dragon Power, the large Yellow Croaker shuddered and stayed still immediately.At Level Two, his Dragon Power not only covered an area of 10 meters, but the marine animals within 10 meters, which were lower levels than him, would be oppressed and controlled by him.At a size of one meter, Wang Xian opened his mouth and gulped down the fish.The sea was about five to six meters deep. No one would discover Wang Xian at the bottom of the sea.\u201cCome, get some workers along with me to the sea and bring some fish up. When the partners from the two countries are here, we can also introduce the fish to them.\u201dJust then, Wang Xian seemed to hear Director Li\u2019s voice. The sea water could not blur his vision as he looked up.Director Li and the middle-aged man boarded a fishing boat, and one of the workers drove the boat to the center of the sea.\u201cBring a few fish of different varieties up.\u201d Director Li ordered the worker at the side.\u201cYes, boss.\u201d The worker nodded. He brought out a net and threw it into the fish farm casually.Soon, dozens of bred fish like sea bass, Yellow Croaker, groupers and puffer fish were caught in the net. They were some of the goods from the fishery.\u201cBoss, the fish are good. I\u2019m sure they can fetch a good price this year,\u201d said the worker holding the fish.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGood. Not bad. Haha,\u201d Director Li laughed out. \u201cWhen the people from the two countries are here, I\u2019m sure our cooperation will be a breeze.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be no problem. After signing this contract, we can have our own supply channel. For the next few years, we will only earn big money.\u201d The middle-aged man fawned over Director Li.\u201cYes.\u201d Director Li stood on the fishing boat and looked out at his fishery with excitement.From now on, this place would be his Aladdin\u2019s cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This should let you know the consequences of offending me and also not to be so arrogant in your actions.\u201dWang Xian shifted his body and activated his Dragon Power. Different types of fish gathered tightly around him. Shifting his body again, all the fish were gathering towards him.This place was different from the sea as the fish were all packed in a small area. Close to three hundred tons of fish were being bred in this confined area and they were free for him to devour.The extractable dragon energy from bred fish are a little lower than those from the other fish. However, their strength lies in their large numbers.Wang Xian got agitated and opened his mouth widely to devour fish after fish in a frenzied manner.There were several hundreds of fish around him. Even if he was devouring one with each mouthful, it would still take a long time under normal circumstances.Wang Xian\u2019s dragon energy was increasing at a terrifying pace. His body size was also growing rapidly from one meter at the beginning to approximately one and a half meters.As for the fish in the fish farm, they were decreasing at a rapid pace.\u201cGreat, this feels really great.\u201dHis strength was increasing rapidly. After an hour, Wang Xian\u2019s body size had reached close to two meters. His devouring speed had increased by ten times and was able to devour a dozen fish per mouthful.And at this moment, Director Li, who was on shore, still had no idea what was happening within his fish farm.There were six to seven men standing beside him beside the shore. These people were clearly not Chinese and Director Li was accompanying them with a cheerful grin.\u201cHello everyone! This is my fish farm. It is the largest and the best fish farm in the entire Rivertown. We are different from those fish farms who do seine fish by the sea. Our farm is five meters deep and the fish we breed have qualities similar to those from the wild.\u201d\u201cWe have yellow croaker fish, puffer fish, grouper and sea bass being reared right here. We have some of them right here and you are free to come and take a look at the quality.\u201dDirector Li spoke confidently to the group of people.Among this group of people, two old men walked over. They squatted down, took a look at the fish in the sea and nodded their heads slightly. \u201cThe quality looks great from the exterior. However, if we are going to sign a long term cooperation agreement, we\u2019ve got to understand more and in more detail,\u201d one of the old men said to Director Li.\u201cNaturally.\u201d Director Li nodded his head. \u201cWe can catch some fish from this place and ask the chef to cook them right away.Since we are going to work together, we should help each other. There would definitely not be any problem.\u201d\u201cGreat. I appreciate Director Li\u2019s honesty. If the fish are of top grade, we are willing to sign the contract with you,\u201d a middle-aged foreigner replied with a smile.\u201cIn that case, please follow me. I believe that the fish from our farm will not disappoint you guys.\u201dDirector Li made an invitational pose to the group and the group of people boarded the fishing boat by the sea.\u201cGo to the center and catch a dozen fish to show our clients,\u201d Director Li walked forward and said to the worker at the fish farm.\u201cAlright, boss.\u201d The worker nodded his head, operated the fishing boat and headed towards the center of the fish farm.\u201cThis fish farm is pretty big and could possibly produce quite a number of types of fish each year.\u201d\u201cIf their fish meet our requirement, we could work with them. After all, their offer price and quantity are pretty attractive.\u201dOn the fishing board, the group of foreigners conversed softly in their own language.Director Li noticed their expressions. He continued, \u201cMy fish farm could breed four to five hundred tons of fish. For this year, this number is about three hundred tons. The number would be even greater next year.\u201d\u201cDirector Li, your fish farm is great. Let\u2019s hope that we can work together,\u201d a foreigner replied.\u201cIt is also my wish to work with you guys.\u201d A burst of excitement flashed past Director Li\u2019s eyes. \u201cI have a restaurant just some distance away. Let me be a good host and treat you guys to a sumptuous meal during the afternoon.\u201d\u201cDefinitely, definitely.\u201d The crowd smiled and nodded their heads.The fishing boat arrived at the center of the fish farm. Director Li signalled to the worker and instructed, \u201cGet some fish for us.\u201d\u201cAlright, boss.\u201dThat worker nodded his head, took out a huge net and threw it ahead of him.The crowd moved to the front of the boat to take a closer look.Swish!The net fell quickly into the water and the worker quickly pulled it back. However, he was shocked when he noticed that the net was empty.\u201cI didn\u2019t catch any?\u201d The worker was a little embarrassed. He smiled at Director Li and explained, \u201cDirector Li, let me do it again. The fish are not concentrated here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, it\u2019s alright.\u201d Director Li shook his head and wasn\u2019t too concerned. He looked to the crowd and explained, \u201cIn order to let the fish have a better environment for growth, the fish in our fish farm aren\u2019t very concentrated.\u201dThe crowd smiled and weren\u2019t too concerned either.The fishing boat moved ahead by several dozens of meters. The worker took out the net and threw it ahead of him once again.Swish!As the fishing net fell into the water, the worker started pulling the net back immediately. However, to his astonishment, he still hadn\u2019t caught a single fish.\u201cEh? What\u2019s happening?\u201d The worker mumbled to himself in shock. When Director Li saw what had happened, he also frowned.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Didn\u2019t we easily catch a dozen fish just this morning?\u201d\u201cBoss, I\u2019m not too sure. Let me give it another try.The worker frowned, sorted out the fishing net and threw it to the surroundings once again.The fish net scattered perfectly on the water. The worker smiled and remarked, \u201cThere should be fish this time.\u201dHowever, when he pulled the net up, there still wasn\u2019t a single fish.This time, the worker was even more shocked. Director Li also frowned and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Why isn\u2019t there a single fish in this area?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why aren\u2019t there any fish despite scattering the net several times? This shouldn\u2019t be happening? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dDoubt surfaced on the foreigners\u2019 faces. They took a glance at Director Li before looking at the fish farm.\u201cPerhaps the fish are all gathered at another location. Xiao Hua, let\u2019s get closer to the edge.\u201dThe worker was confused as he spoke to the young man operating the boat.The fishing boat approached the edge and that worker threw out the fishing net immediately.Splash!The fishing net fell into the sea. After pulling the net up, there was still not a single fish.\u201cHow could it be? How could it be?\u201d The worker was full of shock and surprise. He scattered the net to the surrounding area several more times but still came up empty handed.Director Lee was stunned. He frowned, looked at the surroundings and was clearly embarrassed.\u201cHow can there be no fish? There were still a lot of them in the morning. Why isn\u2019t there any now?\u201d Director Lee asked with a ghastly expression.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBoss, I have no idea either. Logically speaking, we should be getting a lot of fish by just pulling up our net.

How can there be no fish in such a large fish farm?\u201d\u201cDirector Li, where are your fish?\u201dThe group of foreigners frowned as they asked Director Li.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With my current physical body, I guess even a bullet would not hurt me. But according to my research, my human form is much weaker than my dragon form, Wang Xian thought to himself.He did a demonstration last night. He tried to knock himself against a boulder, and the dragon scales on him were unscathed.But his human form was weaker than his dragon form by two times.Wang Xian\u2019s current physical body could take a bullet from a handgun or even some guns that are more powerful.\u201cI still left with the last few thousand fish. I will devour them all and leave nothing here.\u201dWang Xian moved his body at an extremely high speed. Within five minutes, the remaining fish left in the fishery were all devoured.The entire fishery was left with no fish. All of them were exterminated.Director Li was on tenterhooks as he stood on the fishing boat. His body was shuddering, and his voice was shaking. \u201cCarry on with the search. Carry on! How could the fish be missing?!\u201d\u201cYes, boss!\u201d The worker on the boat wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.He had cast over 20 nets just now, and none of them caught any fish. This was extremely peculiar.How could the fish be missing out of the blue from a fishery with at least 300,000 kilograms of fish goods?Voila!The fishnet was cast into the sea, and the same thing happened again.An empty net was pulled out from it.Director Li was getting the creeps when he saw the same thing happening all over again.\u201cDirector Li, didn\u2019t you say you have 300,000 kilograms of fish in your fishery? Where are they now?\u201d\u201cYes, Director Li. For both parties to establish a partnership, we need to see your fish. But now?\u201dAt this time, a group of foreigners on the fishing boat frowned as they looked at Director Li in dismay.Without fish, how are they going to establish the partnership?Upon hearing what they said, Director Li darkened his expression as his heart was racing in fear.The fishery had cost him $20 million to set up.$20 million was invested in the rental and manpower down to the setup, fry and the fish food.Now, he was ready to use the fish goods in the fishery to recover that sum of money.But, all the fish goods in the entire fishery had vanished.Vanished!No doubt, this had impacted him significantly, and he was at risk of bankruptcy.\u201cUse a bigger net and pull them out. I don\u2019t believe 300,000 kilograms of fish can disappear without reason.\u201dDirector Li called out to his worker with a sullen face instead of answering to those foreigners.As the worker on the boat observed the expression on his boss\u2019s face, his blood ran cold. Immediately, he called upon all the other workers to harvest for fish with the purse seine.Three fishing boats reached the center of the fishery and deployed large purse seine to encircle the school with the net.Time passed quickly, and the blazing hot sun was hanging in the sky.Sweat was breaking on Director Li\u2019s forehead while the middle-aged man at the side handed a piece of tissue to him gingerly.The group of foreigners stood at the side, watching impassively.The three fishing boats began to harvest the fish, and the net was drawn up quickly.However, nothing. There were no fish at all. The entire fishery seemed to be completely empty without a single fish fry left.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We wasted a few days of our time.\u201d\u201cYes, what a disappointing trip. Next time, we will not be cooperating with a fishery without any credential.\u201dThe foreigners who stood at the side of the fishery shook their heads as they stared at Director Li coldly. One by one, they turned and walked out.\u201cWhy? Why?!\u201dDirector Li\u2019s eyes opened wide as he murmured to himself while looking at the sea in the fishery. There was only despair left.He seemed to be in a trance-like state as he stumbled and fell on the ground.\u201cDirector Li, Director Li.\u201d The middle-aged man exclaimed as he held Director Li up.\u201cIt\u2019s all over.\u201d Director Li sat on the floor with mixed expressions.\u201cDirector Li, we can start all over again.

Blame it on yourself.\u201dWang Xian glared at Director Li, who was sitting on the shore with cold eyes.He rocked his body and swam towards the sea speedily.The two-meter long body gave off a mighty and imposing vibe. When he reached the steel wire mesh at the exit, Wang Xian stuck out his dragon claws and ripped the wire mesh into a large hole such that he could dive out from it.His speed in the sea was so fast that even the sharks were slower than him.In the sea, the marlins and the swordfish were the only two types of fish that could swim faster than him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAt first, I thought I would need more than 10 days to advance to Level Three.

He stretched his back before looking for a string to tie up all the lobsters and swimming crabs.I\u2019m going to have a good rest when I get back.Wang Xian clenched his fist as he felt the strength of his body. With a face of smiles, he headed forward.It\u2019s easier to get a private-hire car nearer to the Summer Sun Resort. Therefore, he had chosen to walk towards the entrance of the Summer Sun Resort.The sun was hung high up in the sky during the early afternoon. When it was noon time, the skies started to darken. Wang Xian raised his head and took a look at the weather.Perhaps I might be able to summon clouds and make it rain as I wish one day.Wang Xian thought to himself. He smiled and arrived at the entrance of the Summer Sun Resort.There was a huge fountain in front of the main gates of the resort. At the sides of the gate, there were trees and other plants as decoration. These plants cast shadows over an area and there were some tables and chairs under the shade that was available for others to take a break.Wang Xian noticed that there weren\u2019t any private-hire cars at the entrance. He took out his phone and started calling for one through the internet.Huh? It\u2019s raining now?However at this moment, small droplets of rain started falling from the skies. Wang Xian immediately ran towards the shade of the trees.When he arrived at the shade, he saw a middle-aged and old man within it.The old man was wearing a white martial arts suit made of silk and looked just like the typical old people who practiced Taichi in the garden in the morning.As for the middle-aged man, he was wearing a shirt and standing by the side. He was looking at the old man with caring eyes.Wang Xian\u2019s arrival drew the attention of the middle-aged man. He took a glance at him and didn\u2019t pay attention to him thereafter.Wang Xian placed the lobsters and swimming crabs by the side before picking up his phone to continue his booking.Vroom, vroom vroom!At this moment, the revving sounds of the engine of a sports car sounded over. Wang Xian turned his head to took a look and noticed a teenager running out of a Ferrari towards him.\u201cGrandfather.\u201d The teenager looked very strong and healthy. With a simple jump, he leapt over the grass and started shouting excitedly towards the old man, \u201cGrandfather, I\u2019ve made the breakthrough.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The old man looked at his grandson and revealed a satisfied look. \u201cNot bad, not bad. You are much better than your father. Your father had only made the breakthrough when he was 27 years old.\u201d\u201cGrandfather, come and give me some guidance.\u201d The teenager rubbed his hands excitedly.The old man saw Wang Xian. He waved his hand and replied to his grandson, \u201cLet\u2019s do it at night. It\u2019s not very convenient right now.\u201dThe teenager was taken aback slightly. He took a glance at Wang Xian, who was standing just beside them, and knew that his grandfather was a little wary.He turned towards Wang Xian and said directly, \u201cHey brother, do you mind excusing yourself from here. We have some matters to attend to.\u201dWhen Wang Xian heard his words, doubts arose in his mind as he looked at the teenager in front of him.His demanding demeanor pissed Wang Xian off and thus he just ignored the teenager.Huh? The teenager frowned and a cold and murderous intent flashed past his eyes. He walked slowly towards Wang Xian.\u201cXiao Jing, don\u2019t cause trouble,\u201d the old man reminded him when he noticed his grandson was walking over.\u201cGrandfather, I\u2019ll just be inviting him away. I won\u2019t cause any trouble.\u201d The teenager seemed to be a little fearful of the old man as he turned around and replied to him. After which, he extended his hand over to Wang Xian and grabbed his shoulder.Wang Xian lifted an eyebrow when he saw the action of the teenager. Looking at his extended arm, Wang Xian moved his right arm and grabbed onto the teenager\u2019s arm.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Wang Xian lifted his head and said coldly to the teenager.Eh? The teenager looked surprised. Soon after, the corner of his mouth arched up slightly as he spoke. \u201cYour reaction is pretty quick?\u201dMoving his arm, he reverse grabbed onto Wang Xian\u2019s right arm.So fast! A normal person definitely couldn\u2019t achieve this speed. Wang Xian was slightly shocked as he looked at the teenager grabbing onto his arm.At this point, he recalled the conversation between them and the \u201cMartial Artist\u201d the boss robber had mentioned previously.Could it be that they are martial artists?\u201cHey, brat, please get out of our sight.\u201d The teenager looked at Wang Xian with eyes of mockery and disdain. However, he was gradually applying force with his palm.Pretty strong! Wang Xian was once again slightly shocked as he felt the strength of the teenager through his arm.At the same time, he started exerting a little strength onto the arm of the teenager.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cYou are seeking your own death!\u201dA horrifying shriek of pain propagated. Following which, the teenager growled furiously.The middle-aged man and old man were shocked when they heard the shriek and quickly turned around.\u201cXiao Jing, stop it! Don\u2019t injure others!\u201d they shouted when they saw the teenager lifting his leg and sweeping it viciously towards Wang Xian.Feeling his arm going numb, the angered teenager didn\u2019t stop but instead attacked furiously with his right leg.\u201cIt\u2019s you who are seeking your own death.\u201dWang Xian saw the vicious attack from the teenager. His expression turned colder and he reached out his palm directly.What seemed like an unstoppable right leg was grabbed directly and no longer pushed ahead.Similarly, Wang Xian lifted his leg and kicked towards the chest of the teenager.Bam!The strong impact force smashed the teenager onto the stone bench by the side. The teenager couldn\u2019t hold back and vomited blood, followed by a horrifying shriek.\u201cHow dare you injure my son!\u201dEverything happened in just a blink of an eye. They had initially thought that this young man would be injured by the teenager. However, in just an instant, Xiao Jing was the one who was so gravely injured that he spat out blood from the impact.The middle-aged man was stunned. However, he moved quickly subsequently and attacked Wang Xian like a leopard hunting its prey.Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man and murderous intent started to build up.The speed of the middle-aged man was much faster than the teenager. However, it was still too slow in his eyes.Looking at the fist that was attacking towards him, he reached out his hand directly.He stopped the fist with one hand and stopped it from moving an inch.The middle-aged man was shocked. The punch he had put all his strength in was stopped as though it was being fixed in the position.\u201cToo weak.\u201dWang Xian also lifted his fist and attacked towards the stomach of the middle-aged man.Bam!The mighty strength of the Divine Dragon sent the middle-aged man to his knees directly.\u201cHey pal, this is just a misunderstanding.\u201d The old man was dumbfounded to see the young man defeating his grandson and son with just a kick and a punch. He quickly interrupted.Wang Xian looked to the old man and shrugged his shoulders slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is just a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, son. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m Xue Liangren, please accept my apologies,\u201d the old man hurried over and said to Wang Xian with his right fist clasped in his left palm.\u201cPlease forgive us. My grandson and son failed to recognize how mighty you are. If they have offended you, please allow me to apologize for them.\u201dThe old man repeated himself.Cough cough! The old man was a little agitated and started coughing violently. He quickly took out a white handkerchief to wipe his mouth and his blood was all over the handkerchief.Wang Xian looked at the old man. He shook his head slightly and remarked, \u201cForget it.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe wasn\u2019t a person with violent tendencies. If the teenager\u2019s attitude was better and he hadn\u2019t wanted to show his strength in front of him, he would not have retaliated.Moreover, he had not controlled his strength well when he attacked previously.He had thought that the other party was strong but they were unexpectedly weak to spit out blood after just taking a kick. This guy was just too unlucky.Too weak, too weak! Is this the strength of a martial artist?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He endured the pain and stood up as he saw his father spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. Then, he walked to the side of the old man.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d The old man waved his hand with an ashen face. \u201cTake a look at Xiao Jing and call the ambulance.\u201dThe middle-aged man nodded. He swept a wary gaze at Wang Xian and walked quickly to his son.\u201cXiao Jing, are you alright?\u201dThe expression of the middle-aged man was awful as he placed his hand on the chest of the juvenile. Immediately, he fished for his phone and called an ambulance.How could this young man be so formidable? I don\u2019t think I was his match, even during my peak.Xue Liangren coughed again as he observed Wang Xian with terror.It never rains, but it pours. Not only did he sustain serious injuries, but his grandson also encountered a formidable expert.He did not expect that the arrogant behavior of his grandson would bring such a disastrous consequence.If the other party insisted on going after them, that would be simply an undeserved catastrophe for the Xue Family.The moment he thought of this, Xue Liangren felt his injuries worsen. He staggered to a seat that had a briefcase on it. Without hesitation, he took out a checkbook and wrote $10 million on it.This was a gift of apology. Even if they could not befriend him, they could never allow themselves to provoke such a young and formidable expert at this time.Wang Xian did not bother about them as he peered at the three generations.If someone provokes me, I\u2019ll definitely pay them back. Otherwise, I would not provoke anyone without reason.This was Wang Xian\u2019s principle even though he possessed a powerful strength now.Of course, he knew he needed to remove all source of trouble if they were his foes. After all, he had seen and read so many dramas and novels.A good man died for his kindness while a scoundrel died for speaking too much.\u201cYoung chap.\u201dWhen Wang Xian was about to hop in a cab and leave, the old man came to him slowly.\u201cHur?\u201d Wang Xian raised his eyebrow when he spun and looked at the old man.\u201cMy grandson was reckless and offended you just now. I\u2019m here to apologize on his behalf.\u201dThe old man took the check in both hands and handed to Wang Xian.\u201c$10 million?\u201d Wang Xian was shocked to see the figures on the cheque.$10 million. This is $10 million. The old man is offering this amount of money as an apology.He looked at the old man, stunned.\u201cPlease accept it.\u201d Seeing no response from Wang Xian, he thought Wang Xian was not going to forgive them. Hence, he pleaded again with trepidation.Cough, cough. After he finished his sentence, he began to cough non-stop again. He quickly covered his mouth with his hand, but blood was dripping off from it.Upon seeing this, Wang Xian took the check.\u201cThank you for forgiving us.\u201d The pale-looking old man had a faint smile on his face.\u201cFather.\u201d When the middle-aged man at the side heard the coughing, he was so worried that he looked over and called to him.\u201cI will not take this money for nothing.\u201d Wang Xian looked at the old man and said. He placed his palm on the chest area of that old man.\u201cYoung chap.\u201d The old man stiffened up when Wang Xian suddenly struck, as he was not able to resist him at all.Without saying a word, an amount of Dragon Energy entered the old man\u2019s body. Almost immediately, the condition of the old man appeared in Wang Xian\u2019s mind.\u201cHmm?\u201d There was a black spot at the heart. Besides that, he found unique energy in eight extraordinary meridians which protected his heart. Otherwise, he would have been dead. Could this energy be so-called Internal Energy?Wang Xian was doubtful when he was examining the injuries in the old man\u2019s body.He pressed his palm against the old man\u2019s chest. As he gently pressed down his palm twice, the Dragon Energy traveled to the location where the black spot was.The Dragon Energy was the most formidable energy of all. It could strengthen the physical body and upgrade marine animals. As such, it had a tremendous effect in healing too.After consuming about 100 points of Dragon Energy, Wang Xian cleared up the black spot around his heart.He pressed his palm again when he saw the clotted blood in the old man\u2019s body.\u201cThis\u2026!\u201d Just when the old man was freaked out, he suddenly felt a stream of warm energy envelope his heart.Soon after, he felt something gush out of his throat, and he spat out a mouthful of black-colored blood!\u201cWhat are you doing? Don\u2019t hurt my father. Otherwise, I\u2019ll fight you out with my life\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dThe middle-aged man had bloodshot eyes as he raged when his father spat out blood after Wang Xian placed his palm on his chest.However, the old man stopped him before he could finish his sentence. Different from his previous breathless voice, he sounded full of energy.\u201cYoung chap, you\u2019re my benefactor. Thank you. Thank you for treating my injury. Thank you.\u201dThe old man bent his body with his fists cupped as he bowed to Wang Xian.His cheeks were blushed, and his eyes were filled with excitement.The moment he spat the blood, he knew he was fully recovered from his injury.The old man knew that this injury of his almost had his life. It was difficult to treat and recover from it.Yet, what the young man before him did was place his palm at his chest, and it was healed after some presses. What kind of ability was this?Even the disciples of the Medical Saint or one of the highly-skilled doctors from the Sacred Followers Guild would not be able to get this cured at this speed.Is he the disciple of the Medical Saint? Or one of the disciples from the Sacred Followers Guild? This is freaking scary!\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, this will pay for your medical bills.\u201d Wang Xian waved the check in his hand. He looked and walked over to the juvenile who was in a coma. \u201cMight as well do it together.\u201dIn a nutshell, the juvenile could only blame his condition on his luck as he offended Wang Xian, while he had no idea of the strength he possessed. In the end, he spat blood after his kick, and it almost cost him a life.Since the old man gave $10 million, Wang Xian regarded it as their medical bills.Wang Xian did not want to take advantage of others. Spending more than 100 points of Dragon Energy in exchange for $10 million was quite a good deal for him.Wang Xian came to the juvenile and placed his hand on his chest.Under the scan of the Dragon Energy, he realized that a few of his rib-bones were broken and one of them even pierced through his lungs. His injuries were rather severe. If not for his strong physique, he could have died by now.Wang Xian shook his head and healed the juvenile with his Dragon Energy.\u201cHur?\u201d The juvenile opened his eyes as his injuries were slowly recovering. When he saw Wang Xian, he could not help but shudder.\u201cYou should thank him for treating you. He forgave you and healed your injuries.

When the teenager attacked him, the two of them immediately shouted at the teenager for him to stop.Subsequently, the old men even apologized sincerely. At that moment, Wang Xian had already forgiven them.After which, the old man even gave him $10 million! This was the main reason for him to help to cure their injuries.\u201cThank you, pal.\u201d Old man, Xue Liangren, clasped his right fist with his left palm as he thanked Wang Xian.\u201cThank you, benefactor.\u201d\u201cThank you, big brother.\u201dThe middle-aged man and teenager also thank him in succession. Although that teenager was probably older than Wang Xian, he still addressed Wang Xian as big brother.There\u2019s no way he could not be convinced of Wang Xian\u2019s capabilities.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, you have paid for your medical fees.\u201d Wang Xian waved his hand and said to the old man.\u201cPal, these medical fees are nothing compared with my injuries. If there\u2019s anything my Xue Family could help you with, feel free to instruct us. We would not reject you.\u201d Xue Liangren spoke sincerely.Wang Xian looked at the old man and smiled. He changed his tone before continuing, \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019m curious about and would like to ask if you are willing to tell me?\u201d\u201cIf I know, I would not keep anything back.\u201d The old man replied in a hurry.\u201cWhen it comes to cultivating, do you mind explaining it in detail to me?\u201d Wang Xian asked curiously.He had no knowledge about martial artists, cultivation and internal energy at all.\u201cCultivate?\u201d Xue Liangren was a little shocked. However, he organized his thoughts quickly and said, \u201cThe current cultivation ways are known as ancient martial arts. Those who have stepped into the world of ancient martial arts are known as martial artists and are hidden within cities. Although there aren\u2019t a lot of them, the numbers are definitely not small. They exist in the forms of families or sects. Many large corporations are directly or indirectly controlled by martial artist families or sects.\u201d\u201cMartial artists could be segregated into nine levels. Through absorbing spiritual energy, they are able to open their eight extraordinary meridians. One could advance a level by opening one extraordinary meridian. When all eight extraordinary meridians are opened, one would be at Level Nine. When one had sufficient and complete spiritual energy, they would be classified as \u201cInborn.\u201d Inborn experts are the real experts in the world. I, Xue Liangren, am not too gifted. I was exposed to ancient martial arts by accident when I was young. Now that I\u2019m 85 years old, I\u2019m only at Level Six and am the number five in Rivertown. This allows me to support my small Xue family.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head in deep thought upon hearing what the old man said. The world is mysterious and he wouldn\u2019t find it strange that it had martial artists.\u201cMy son, Xue Jiahua, is pretty capable and is currently at martial artist Level Five. My grandson, Xue Jing, is even more gifted and is at martial artist Level Four,\u201d the old man added. He looked at Wang Xian and continued, \u201cWith your strength, you are probably at martial artist Level Seven. You are really insanely gifted and a once in a million years talent.\u201dLevel Seven? Wang Xian was slightly shocked. His current level was only three.However, his Level Three was based on the divine dragon\u2019s classification. In other words, he could fight with human martial artists four levels above him.\u201cLevel Four martial artists could dodge a bullet and Level Five martial artists could survive under gunfire. When one reaches Level 6, ordinary bullets would not be a threat anymore. At Level Seven, one could ignore bullets. Only concentrated cannon bombardment could kill you. As for Level Eight and Nine, one would be even stronger. When one reached the Inborn stage, one could be the ruler of a region.\u201d Xue Liangren explained this slowly.Wang Xian nodded his head and broke into laughter. \u201cThank you for the information. I have some things to attend to and I\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d\u201cEh? Hey, pal, I\u2019ll get Jiahua to send you back.\u201d The old man replied in a hurry.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll just call for a car.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head and rejected the offer.\u201cBig brother, let me give you a ride. My car is just right there!\u201dXue Jing spoke immediately and pointed to his sports car by the side.\u201cYeah pal, let Xiao Jing give you a ride. It would be quicker.\u201d The old man seconded.\u201cHmm, alright.\u201d Wang Xian saw the private-hire car left from the entrance of the resort and therefore didn\u2019t reject this time.\u201cCome, big brother, let me help you carry this. You can just get into the car.\u201dXue Jing acted sensibly as he took the large lobsters and swimming crabs at the side before running towards the sports car quickly to open the car door.Wang Xian nodded at Xue Jing and sat in it directly.Xue Jing smiled and closed the door carefully.\u201cXiao Jing!\u201d At this point, Xue Liangren and the middle-aged man walked over and shouted at Xue Jing.\u201cGrandfather, father.\u201d Xue Jing walked up immediately and greeted.\u201cThis is the Family membership card for our Summer Sun Holiday Resort. Please pass it to that pal. You must definitely treat him well. This might just be an opportunity for the Xue Family. Remember this! Our Xue Family is still very weak.\u201d Xue Liangren instructed Xue Jing sternly.\u201cRest assured, grandfather. I know what I have to do and I won\u2019t be rash.\u201d Xue Jing nodded his head solemnly.\u201cHmm\u2026 Get this pal back quickly.\u201d Xue Liangren patted him on the shoulders.\u201cYes.\u201d Xue Jing got into his car immediately.\u201cBig brother, where would you like to go?\u201d\u201cUniversity of Rivertown,\u201d Wang Xian replied with a smile upon hearing how Xue Jing addressed him, seeing the blood stains on his clothes.\u201cAlright, big brother. Big brother, are you a student at the University of Rivertown? I graduated from that university in the past,\u201d Xue Jing said with a smiling face. He started the car and saw Wang Xian nod his head. At this point, he took out the Family membership card for Summer Sun Resort that his grandfather had passed to him.This was a \u201cFamily membership card.\u201d Although it might sound clich\u00e9, it was much more valuable than the platinum or diamond cards that they gave to other customers.\u201cFamily membership card\u201d was representing the Xue Family.Up till this point in time, the Xue Family had only issued two such cards. One who possessed this card could enjoy the best service in Summer Sun Resort without any cost forever.Moreover, \u201cfamily membership card\u201d gave the impression of closeness and could help them shorten the distance between them.\u201cBig brother, this is a \u201cFamily membership card\u201d for our Summer Sun Resort and is our highest grade card. With this card, you can enjoy the most premium service at no cost forever. If big brother has the time, you can drop by. Feel free to bring your friends along.\u201dXue Jing held the card beside Wang Xian as he explained.Summer Sun Resort?! When Wang Xian saw this card, he was a little surprised. \u201cSummer Sun Resort is your family\u2019s property?\u201d\u201cYes, big brother. We have another Summer Sun International Hotel in the city too. This card could also be used there. Big brother, please accept this,\u201d replied Xue Jing.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, it\u2019s alright. Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He had not expected the family of three generations would be the owner of Summer Sun Resort. This explained why they could take out $10 million as compensation directly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBig brother, you have to accept it. I\u2019m under the orders of my grandfather and father. Otherwise, I will be beaten by them when I get back.\u201d Xue Jing turned around and acted pitifully.What the!

He swung the bag of lobsters and swimming crabs back to school.\u201cPhew!\u201d Xue Jing let out a loud breath as he looked at Wang Xian\u2019s back view. He then added Wang Xian on his Wechat immediately with a thrilled face.Boom!Once Wang Xian returned to his room, he threw the lobsters and the swimming crabs into a basin. Then, he looked at the Family membership card of Summer Sun Resort and that $10 million check.\u201cI\u2019ll bank in the money first.\u201dThe time was 4 PM. Wang Xian placed the Family membership card into his wallet and headed out with the check.He rode his Harley motorcycle to the nearest bank. After depositing the check, his balance had broken the $20 million mark.\u201cSuch a young age with $20 million assets. Sigh!\u201dWang Xian tossed his bank card into the air as if he was some big shot before he got back on his motorcycle.Then he bought new utensils, sauces, etc. when he was at the supermarket.After everything was done, it was already past 5 pm. Wang Xian took out his phone and dialed Guan Shuqing.\u201cHello, Wang Xian!\u201dUpon receiving Wang Xian\u2019s call, Guan Shuqing, who was upset with her father\u2019s call earlier on, turned gleeful.\u201cAre you free tonight? I got some lobsters and swimming crabs. Want to do some outdoor cooking?\u201dWang Xian asked Guan Shuqing with a grin. When Guan Shuqing treated him to dinner last night, he told her that it would be a seafood feast from now on.\u201cTonight? Sure! Are there any huge lobsters?\u201d asked Guan Shuqing smilingly, who brightened up her eyes when she heard Wang Xian\u2019s question.\u201cOf course. I still have big lobsters and some swimming crabs. I\u2019ll change the menu for you a few days from now,\u201d Wang Xian chuckled and replied.\u201cHehe, then I shall not stand on ceremony with you.

It\u2019s a celebration for closing the international deal.\u201d The young man looked at Guan Shuqing with a tinge of greed flashing in his eyes.\u201cHur? Tonight? Director Zhou, I don\u2019t think I can make it. I promised my friend to have dinner together!\u201dGuan Shuqing was slightly stunned, and she quickly shook her head and declined. She had already promised Wang Xian.\u201cHur? Why?\u201d the young man frowned. \u201cEight of us from the business operation team and the translation team will be gathering tonight.

She fished out her phone and walked to the side.The young man drew his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s better if her friend is a girl, but it doesn\u2019t matter even if it\u2019s a guy.\u201dHe smiled confidently before heading back to his office.Wang Xian wondered why when he saw Guan Shuqing\u2019s number on the phone when they just ended the conversation not long ago.\u201cWhy do you call again?\u201d he questioned.\u201cWang Xian, there\u2019s a gathering with my colleagues tonight. My boss wants me to go no matter what,\u201d Guan Shuqing said. Before Wang Xian could say anything, she quickly added on, \u201cI already turned my boss down, but he asked me to come with my friend. Why don\u2019t you join us as well?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think this is right, is it?\u201d Wang Xian was slightly stunned by her words. Straightaway, he shook his head and rejected her. \u201cThis is your company\u2019s gathering. It would be inappropriate for me to go.\u201d\u201cWang Xian, can you\u2026 can you come over? I\u2019ve only been here for two days, and I\u2019m not very familiar with the rest of the colleagues. Besides, I won\u2019t be working here for too long. If you are here, I can have someone to talk to. The venue is at the First-grade Restaurant near our school.\u201d Guan Shuqing dragged her last word out as she seemed to be pleading with him.\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Wang Xian was hesitant, but he finally nodded his head. \u201cFine.\u201d\u201cHehe, thank you. When I get my pay, I\u2019ll give you a treat.\u201d Upon hearing his consent, Guan Shuqing was so happy that she laughed.\u201cStill, my treat.\u201d Wang Xian smiled. They arranged a time and hung up the phone.\u201cAt most, I\u2019ll foot the bill since it\u2019s her colleagues\u2019 gathering.\u201dWang Xian put his phone back in his pocket and shrugged. Since he had over $20 million on his card now, he was full of confidence.Buzz!After he stored his lobsters and the swimming crabs and changed his clothes, his phone buzzed again.\u201cLan Qingyue?\u201d Wang Xian opened his Wechat and was shocked to see her message. \u201cLang Qingyue asked me out for dinner. Looks like I\u2019m quite popular after all!\u201dHe touched his face as he was feeling himself. However, he turned her down with a reply, \u201cI\u2019m having dinner with my friend tonight. Sorry, next time then!\u201dAt the same time, Lan Qingyue was a little uptight as she sat on the sofa in the luxurious villa.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was the first time she asked a guy out for dinner. As she recalled the figure who hugged her, she was looking forward to it while feeling nervous.Hence, when the notification sound rang, she quickly checked on it.\u201cRejected. He actually rejected me.\u201d Lan Qingyue was dazed as she looked at the message. She felt something special within her.She did not expect she would get rejected the first time she asked a guy out for dinner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ll get you some tea.\u201dThe waitress was well-trained and pointed to the sofa at the waiting area. After which, she went to get a cup of water.Wang Xian nodded his head and sat to the side. He took out his mobile phone and started playing while waiting for Guan Shuqing to arrive.Clap clap, clap clap!\u201cWhere\u2019s Director Li?\u201dAt this moment, a group of people appeared at the entrance. A young man asked his question with a smile and a cigarette in his mouth.\u201cYou guys are? Do you have an appointment with Director Li?\u201d The greeters at the entrance looked curiously at the group of four men who walked over.\u201cDirector Li was the one who asked us over. Where is he?\u201d the young man replied. He scrutinized the two greeters and commented flirtatiously, \u201cPretty, beautiful.\u201dThe two greeters frowned.\u201cDirector Zhou! Your guys are here! The office is a little small, shall we sit here?\u201dAt this moment, the slightly plump Director Li walked out from a small room beside the cashier. There was a middle-aged man following beside him.Upon hearing Director Li\u2019s voice, the edge of Wang Xian\u2019s mouth arched up. He turned his attention over.At this moment, Director Li was no longer looking as rosy as he had been in the morning. In fact, he looked a little pale and seemed to be fatigued.The middle-aged man beside him wasn\u2019t looking pleased either.\u201cOh Director Li, you aren\u2019t looking too well. Hehe.\u201d The young man looked at Director Li and it was clear that he was mocking him.\u201cI caught the flu in the morning and am not feeling too well.\u201d Director Li walked over with a straight face and invited him into the restaurant.\u201cHehe.\u201d The young man smiled. Together with the three other men who came with him, they headed directly to the sofa in the waiting area. Sitting upright, he looked at Director Li and said, \u201cI\u2019m really surprised to have received Director Li\u2019s call. Just a month ago, I invited you over for a sumptuous banquet and requested to acquire your restaurant. However, you rejected it. What\u2019s the matter now? Did you change your mind?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve changed my mind. I have a better business plan to execute and therefore am preparing to sell First-grade Restaurant.\u201dDirector Li sat at the side, lifted the teacup served by the waiter and squeezed out a faint smile.\u201cOh, is it? In that case, how much is Director Li looking to sell it to me for?\u201d The edge of the young man\u2019s mouth arched upwards. He leaned back on the sofa and seemed to be seeing this as a joke.\u201cLet\u2019s go with Director Zhou\u2019s previous offer, $23 million!\u201d Director Li looked at him and said.\u201cWhat? $23 million?\u201d The young man pretended to be shocked. \u201cDirector Li, the $23 million offer was when I came to you and offered to buy. Now that you have come to me to sell, how could it still be $23 million?\u201d\u201cMoreover\u2026\u201d The young man paused and looked coldly at Director Li. \u201cI wanted to buy this place but Director Li wasn\u2019t willing to sell in the past. I just purchased a restaurant just a stone\u2019s throw away from here and am renovating it. I am still intending to compete with you directly in the future!\u201dUpon hearing the young man, Director Li\u2019s expression turned ghastly. He replied resolutely, \u201cMy First-grade Restaurant has been around for five to six years and its reputation has already spread throughout Rivertown. Even if you would like to compete with me directly, we will not be afraid. As long as my First-grade Restaurant is still around, your restaurant would also be greatly and negatively affected!\u201d\u201cDirector Li\u2026what you are saying is that I shouldn\u2019t open the restaurant that I have already spent over $10 million on, and should spend more money to purchase yours?\u201d The young man looked at him with contempt.\u201cIt\u2019s over $10 million because you bought the building with it. I believe that simply losing some renovation costs to guarantee your business would be a great deal!\u201d Director Li replied with a frown.\u201cHehe.\u201d The young man laughed again. He stared at Director Li and replied, \u201cDirector Li, since I have decided to do it, I\u2019m not afraid of your First-grade Restaurant. It\u2019s still uncertain who will win in the end but I can guarantee that your losses will be severe.\u201d\u201cNow that you would like to sell First-grade Restaurant\u2026 Great! $13 million. If you would like to sell, I\u2019ll buy. If you aren\u2019t willing, we shall see how it goes.\u201d\u201c$13 million? Impossible. Just the building alone is worth close to $10 million. To ask me to sell my restaurant to you for $3 million?\u201d When Director Li heard his reply, he raised his voice and his face turned dark.\u201cAt most $15 million. If you want to sell, then sell. If you will not, you can just sell to others.\u201d The young man sat there confidently. \u201cWith Longxuan Restaurant\u2019s publicity and strength currently, this would be the most you could get from any other buyer.\u201dUpon hearing what he said, Director Li had an embarrassed look.Just as the young man had said, the profit of his restaurant each year was only four to five million over the last few years. The asking price of over $20 million wasn\u2019t high at all.However, there was a strong competitor coming up along this street.The young master of Rivertown Distant Sea Fishing Group would be entering this business. His family business was in distant water fishing and had ample resources. He would also be able to basically obtain all kinds of seafood.Seeing how this young man in front of him was willing to spend and was daring, it was hard for him to tell who would emerge victorious in their future competition.It would be impossible for him to sell his restaurant for over $20 million. In fact, it was still uncertain if he could even sell it for $17-18 million.Despite his considerations, he knew he would be filled with indignance if he had to sell to him for $15 million.Director Li\u2019s expression was changing constantly. He was considering all his options, and this incident today was a lethal blow to him.All the fish in his entire fish farm had disappeared without a reason. Fish that were worth several tens of million had just vanished into the air!At this moment, he had to return the bank loan as soon as possible. Otherwise, his mortgaged home might be taken over by the bank.The only option he had was to sell First-grade Restaurant.He was out of other options!The young man sat there confidently and said to Director Li, \u201cI can give you cash. As long as you are willing to sell, $15 million will be transferred to your account immediately. You should know that there aren\u2019t many people who can come out with so much cash at one time to invest at this moment.\u201d\u201cDirector Li, it\u2019s better if you sell First-grade Restaurant. Those who are slightly capable would know that buying First-grade Restaurant at the moment might not be profitable. In fact, my brother might even lose from this investment. There aren\u2019t many people who can bear this.\u201d The 18-19 years old juvenile, who was sitting beside the young man, remarked excitedly.He lifted one of his legs and rested it on the other leg in a cocky manner. Looking at Wang Xian, who had been listening to their conversation, he laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t you agree with me, pal? Will you buy this place if you have $15 million?\u201dThe juvenile was exhilarated. He would be in his freshman year when the school reopened and was an incoming student to the University of Rivertown. With his brother\u2019s restaurant right here and it being the most luxurious in the vicinity, it would be a fantastic experience for him when he brought his classmates over to show off to them.Just thinking about it made him a little excited.\u201cI will buy.\u201dThe three words that sounded suddenly from the side shocked the juvenile. He saw Wang Xian had a serious look to him and was instantly stunned. Following which, he burst into laughter, \u201cHaha, my friend. You will buy? Can you even afford it? All you could do is to fantasize about it! Wake up!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDirector Li, do consider the offer price of $16 million.\u201dWang Xian looked nonchalantly at the juvenile and took out a platinum card from the Agricultural Bank of China. One had to have over $5 million deposited in order to get such a card.Although this card might not have $16 million on it, it was still a symbol of one\u2019s strength.Capitalism!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ll buy First-grade Restaurant. What do you think, Director Li?\u201d Wang Xian asked Director Li with a smiling face.When they were talking just now, Wang Xian\u2019s attention was drawn when he overheard Director Li was going to sell away the First-grade Restaurant.At present, he had some money obtained through special ways, but he had no stable source of income.If he bought the First-grade Restaurant, he could manage the restaurant in the future.Moreover, he had a great advantage of catching his own seafood if he took over the restaurant.Perhaps it might be a waste of time for him to catch his own, but he could get his subordinates from the Dragon Palace to do it. Till then, his procurement of seafood would be at zero cost.The restaurant just had to pay off the staff wages and the necessary expenses.The business would not lose out. It\u2019s 100% profitable.Wang Xian wanted to wait until they left before he discussed with Director Li. Who knew the juvenile beside him would lend him a helping hand? What a kind person he was.\u201c$16 million, are\u2026you really going to take over?\u201d The juvenile pointed at Wang Xian in disbelief and asked with a shaky voice.The boy before him was just as young as him. Yet, he could actually fork over $16 million to buy the restaurant. How\u2026 could this be possible?Wang Xian looked at the juvenile before he fixed his gaze on Director Li.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Director Li saw Wang Xian and recognized him. With a mixed expression, he asked, \u201cAre you really buying the restaurant?\u201d\u201cOf course, I will not joke around when it concerns millions of dollars. $16 million. Are you selling or not? If you are selling, we can sign the contract and make the payment tomorrow.\u201d Wang Xian nodded with a solemn face.Director Li had a change in his expression before he cast his gaze to the young man at the side.At this time, the young man fixed his gaze on Wang Xian, \u201cYoung chap, are you sure you want to buy the First-grade Restaurant? Think it over again.\u201d\u201cDepends on the price. If it\u2019s too expensive, I\u2019ll not buy it. I\u2019m offering $16 million. Aren\u2019t you going to counteroffer?\u201d Wang Xian smiled at the young man.Bang!Suddenly, the young man banged his hand on the table. \u201cThink again. If you are buying over the restaurant, be prepared to challenge Longxuan Restaurant. When the time comes, don\u2019t lose your pants and go bankrupt.\u201dSensing the threat from him, Wang Xian picked up the teacup slowly from the table and said indifferently, \u201cI love challenges. If you want to fight it out, I\u2019m all in for it. But who will lose his pants? Hehe, it\u2019ll not be me. \u201d\u201cFine!\u201dThe young man stood up straight away, \u201cI can do without the First-grade Restaurant. Since you want to have a game, let\u2019s do it. Lad, you\u2019re still an amateur.\u201d\u201cIf I take over here,\u201d Wang Xian stood up slowly, \u201cYou will not be my match!\u201dA tit for tat.He displayed the shining edge of a Divine Dragon against his opponents and gave off an invisible imposing demeanor.The young man felt embarrassed by the faint oppression.\u201cFine, fine. You\u2019re ridiculous. We\u2019ll wait and see!\u201d The young man glared at him with a ferocious look in his eyes.\u201cAnytime.\u201d Wang Xian looked at the young man with a smile on his face.\u201cHmph, I\u2019ll make sure you lose big time.\u201dThe young man left after he made those harsh remarks as he stared at Director Li coldly.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re doomed!\u201d said the juvenile as he jumped up and pointed at Wang Xian with an angry face after he saw his elder brother had left.Wang Xian threw him a nonchalant look and ignored him before he turned to Director Li.People like the juvenile were not qualified to speak to him, except for his brother.\u201cYoung lad, are you really buying the First-grade Restaurant with $16 million?\u201dDirector Li did not look at those young people who left. Instead, he questioned Wang Xian again.\u201c100% positive.\u201dWang Xian nodded.\u201cHmph!\u201dUpon seeing Wang Xian ignoring him, the juvenile walked out, feeling embarrassed.\u201cBrother, that fellow was extremely haughty just now. We cannot let him off just like this.\u201dThe juvenile caught up with the young man with an infuriated look on his face after he walked out of the First-grade Restaurant.\u201cOkay, I got it.\u201d The young man brushed him off without any patience. If his younger brother had not provoked that guy, he would not have expressed his interest in buying the First-grade Restaurant.If he could take over the restaurant at $15 million, it would be the best choice for him. There was no risk, and it was a profitable business.Now, he would have to fight it out.\u201cAnyway, Longxuan Restaurant has completed the renovation. We can open for business soon. Till then\u2026\u201dThe young man darkened his expression as he thought of that fellow\u2019s haughty look just now.\u201cJust wait and see. I\u2019ll let you have a taste of regret for offending me.\u201d\u2026\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss the transfer of ownership at 9 AM tomorrow.\u201dBack at the First-grade Restaurant, Director Li was smiling at Wang Xian.He was already content to sell the restaurant at $16 million.\u201cSure, 9 tomorrow.\u201d Wang Xian nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll get the things prepared first. Let\u2019s have dinner together.\u201d Director Li said as he stood up.\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m meeting my friends.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head with a smile. Apart from this business deal, he had nothing to chat with Director Li about.\u201cSure, enjoy your dinner. This place will be yours tomorrow!\u201dAs soon as Director Li finished his words, he looked at his restaurant and sighed as he was unsure if he could make a comeback in the future after selling the restaurant.He walked into the office at the side with low spirits. He would probably never find out that the person who landed him into his current plight was right in front of him.Everything was to blame on his arrogance.Buzz.Wang Xian\u2019s phone rang after waiting in the waiting area for 10 minutes or so.\u201cHello? I\u2019m here, in the waiting area,\u201d Wang Xian received the call and told Guan Shuqing.\u201cWang Xian.\u201dAs his voice trailed off, he heard Guan Shuqing\u2019s voice at the door.She waved at him and walked towards him.Wang Xian gleamed and walked forward to greet her before he saw a group of people behind her.The one leading the group of youngsters was a 28 or 29 years-old young man who was wearing a trendy summer clothes series from Armani. He was 1.8 meters tall and rather good-looking.When Wang Xian was looking at him, the young man was observing him too.A guy wearing Versace on him. His family should be quite well-to-do.Director Zhou narrowed his eyes and observed Wang Xian from head to toe. He raised his eyebrows, but he was not bothered by him at all.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn his opinion, Wang Xian was still inexperienced.\u201cShuqing, is this your friend? Hello, I\u2019m Zhou Yuanhao.\u201dZhou Yuanhao walked over and extended his hand to introduce himself with a face full of smiles.Wang Xian looked at him inquisitively. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Wang Xian!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not bad, not bad.\u201dZhou Yuanhao looked at Wang Xian, extended his hand towards his shoulders and wanted to pat on them.\u201cHehe.\u201dWang Xian had his eyes fixed on this young man as he avoided his palm fluently. He had the feeling that this dude was up to something.Zhou Yuanhao\u2019s arm stiffened. Following which, he smiled and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ve made a reservation and we can go straight to the private lounge.\u201d\u201cMisters, this way please.\u201dAs Zhou Yuanhao spoke, the waitress by the side led the way for him.First-grade House could be divided into two stories. The lower level was the main hall while the upper story was where the private lounges were at.\u201cFirst-grade Restaurant is a rather famous restaurant in Rivertown. You can get to taste all types of seafood, abalone, shark fin and sea cucumber. Sometimes, there is also precious seafood such as Atlantic Bluefin marlin sashimi.\u201dZhou Yuanhao was walking at the front of the pack as he explained to the group with a face full of smiles. He looked to Guan Shuqing and Wang Xian, who was beside her, and said, \u201cShuqing, your school is around this area. I\u2019m guessing you know about this restaurant.\u201d\u201cOf course I know about it. This restaurant is known to be expensive,\u201d Guan Shuqing smiled and replied.\u201cHehe, I came here once previously when a friend of mine was giving me a treat. I have to say that the food here is really expensive. A meal in a private lounge will cost at least seven to eight thousand. This is the level of a five-star hotel. Since Director Zhou is paying today, we are in for a treat!\u201d\u201cFirst-grade Restaurant is known for its seafood. Although they are delicious, their prices are too expensive. I heard about it previously but this is still the first time I\u2019ve come here. I have to thank Director Zhou for your generosity.\u201dThe two young commented with intentions to flatter Director Zhou.\u201cHehe. As long as everyone works hard and we do well, such a gathering will be common in the future.\u201dZhou Yuanhao said with magnanimity, \u201cAlthough First-grade Restaurant is expensive, the food they serve is really delicious. I have always liked their food and often patronize this restaurant.\u201d\u201cIn that case, we\u2019ve got to stick close to Director Zhou in the future. There aren\u2019t many bosses who are as generous as Director Zhou!\u201d a girl smiled and said to Director Zhou.\u201cNaturally, I wouldn\u2019t treat you guys badly.\u201dThe edge of Zhou Yuanhao\u2019s mouth arched up.Guan Shuqing and Wang Xian followed behind and didn\u2019t comment as the group arrived at a private lounge.\u201cShuqing, you can sit beside me.\u201dZhou Yuanhao sat at the seat of the host as he spoke to Guan Shuqing, who was just beside him.Guan Shuqing was taken aback slightly before nodding her head and sitting down. She looked to Wang Xian and said, \u201cWang Xian, why don\u2019t you sit beside me?\u201d\u201cHuh? Alright.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head. The few young men and women took a glance at Zhou Yuanhao and Guan Shuqing before sinking into deep thought.\u201cYou guys, take a look at the menu and see what would you like to have. Come!\u00a0Just order as you wish.\u201dZhou Yuanhao passed the menu to Guan Shuqing and asked, \u201cTake a look and see if there\u2019s anything you would like. You can just order it directly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Director Zhou. I\u2019m not a picky eater and am fine with anything.\u201d Guan Shuqing waved her hand and handed the menu back to him.\u201cYou\u2026 Alright. In that case, let me order a few dishes. Hmm\u2026 This sea cucumber porridge with lotus seed is good for the complexion. Let\u2019s get a bowl for Shuqing and the ladies here.\u201dZhou Yuanhao looked and spoke to Guan Shuqing and the few other ladies.\u201cOur Director Zhou is such a gentleman. Hehe,\u201d one of the ladies laughed and said.\u201cThat\u2019s true. After all, Director Zhou attended a famous University in the UK for three years. He\u2019s definitely the role model of a gentleman,\u201d a young man commented as he tried to get on the good books of Director Zhou subtly.\u201cHaha.\u201d Zhou Yuanhao smiled. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get a bottle of champagne and white wine to go along with the seafood.\u201d\u201cAlright, Mister, please wait a moment.\u201d The waitress by the side nodded her head, collected the menus and walked out of the lounge.\u201cShuqing, do you have the intention to come to our company to work after you graduate from school?\u201d Zhou Yuanhao asked as he poured Guan Shuqing a cup of tea after filling his own cup.\u201cDirector Zhou, I can do it myself.\u201d Guan Shuqing tried to take the teapot and pour for herself in a hurry. \u201cI still have two years until my graduation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You can come over to the company during the weekends or when you have no classes. I wouldn\u2019t scrimp on your salary. Our company business is growing larger and larger and we still need some talents,\u201d Zhou Yuanhao remarked.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Guan Shuqing was a little tempted. Now that her father had declared bankruptcy, her family conditions weren\u2019t too great. Currently, she had to settle her own living expenses.\u201cI think it\u2019s fine. Shuqing, this is a good idea. After all, the curriculum of university isn\u2019t that tight. You definitely could gain some working experience during your free time. This is a good thing.\u201d\u201cYeah, just take a look at how well Director Zhou is treating us. It\u2019s hard to get a good boss like him. You might not be able to get such a good job even after you graduated.\u201dThe two young men by the side tried to convince Guan Shuqing.\u201cHmm, this would work too.\u201d Guan Shuqing took a look at Wang Xian who was beside her and nodded her head.When Zhou Yuanhao heard her reply, a joyous feeling surged. \u201cHaha, let\u2019s welcome Shuqing for joining us officially.\u201dAs they were chatting, the dishes were being served one by one.Zhou Yuanhao kept trying to chat with Guan Shuqing. As for Wang Xian, he just sat there alone as he ate the food.\u201cShuqing, do you have a boyfriend?\u201dSuddenly, Zhou Yuanhao asked Guan Shuqing.This question shocked Guan Shuqing. Her eyes were wavering as she turned her head over and looked at Wang Xian.Zhou Yuanhao saw her action and frowned. His vision fell on Wang Xian as he tried to change the topic. \u201cOh, Shuqing, you haven\u2019t introduced us to this friend of yours!\u201d\u201cThis is my classmate, Wang Xian,\u201d Guan Shuqing replied immediately.\u201cHello, everyone, I\u2019m Wang Xian.\u201d Wang Xian remarked.\u201cDon\u2019t just eat, let\u2019s have a chat.\u201d Zhou Yuanhao looked at him and squeezed out a faint smile. \u201cBrother Wang Xian, your family conditions should be pretty good. What is your family like?\u201d\u201cFamily?\u201d When Wang Xian heard him, he laughed, \u201cI only have a sister as kin.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhou Yuanhao was slightly stunned and shocked. A smile appeared as he continued, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to ask about something that I shouldn\u2019t have. However, please allow me to say this. Brother Wang Xian, life isn\u2019t easy. You should be making plans for life after graduation. Similar to Shuqing, you are from the University of Rivertown. It\u2019s clear that you are a capable man. Why don\u2019t you come and work for my company? If you work for me, it would definitely be better when you try to look for a job after graduation.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We will be working for Director Zhou in the future and he would be our leader. Haha!\u201d a young man laughed and said.\u201cHehe. It\u2019s alright.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s better to just enjoy my university life!\u201d\u201cOh, Xiao Wang, that\u2019s not a good mentality to have. You should be working hard starting from university. When you say you want to enjoy your university life, what are you actually thinking of? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not playing games and is about finding a beautiful girlfriend. However, you need to be rich to find a beautiful girlfriend. Buying a bag for your girlfriend would set you back several tens of thousands! Similarly, buying clothes, jewellery and gifts would also be in the range of several tens of thousands!\u201d\u201cAs a young man, one should have goals. This would then give you motivation. If you can\u2019t rely on your family, you can only then rely on yourself.\u201d\u201cFor example, if you want to get a girlfriend as beautiful as Shuqing, you can\u2019t be just giving her a bag that costs a few hundred. Moreover, you can\u2019t even get one at a few hundred dollars nowadays. It can\u2019t be that you are thinking of bringing her to the canteen for meals all the time. All of these would cost money. If I had a girlfriend as beautiful as Shuqing, branded bags and clothes are a necessity. As for other gifts or even a house or car, these are needed in the future.\u201d\u201cThe company my family owns has just started. Despite that, our annual profits are in the range of five to six million dollars. Even so, I feel that my conditions in Rivertown are still below average. Therefore, a young man like you should be looking to start working hard from a young age.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cXiao Wang, you can consider working for me in the future. You can still expect to easily earn $3,000 a month in a part-time role.\u201dDirector Zhou lit a cigarette and smiled.In his words, he had lifted himself up subtly and bashed Wang Xian..Work part-time for $3,000 a month?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hence, he could only give a tall hat to himself and lower the status of Wang Xian indirectly.Be a follower of his? Become his employee?Wang Xian smiled and shook his head gently, \u201cDirector Zhou, the students in our school are not that materialistic. We can get a bag at a few hundred dollars, and date at the school canteen.\u201d\u201cHur?\u201d Upon hearing Wang Xian\u2019s words, Director Zhou had a change in his expression. He did not expect Wang Xian to be sarcastic about him being materialistic.Director Zhou\u2019s eyes glimmered with displeasure.\u201cXiao Wang, you can\u2019t put it that way. Campus love is pure and innocent, but you\u2019ll leave school and enter society after all. Director Zhou said all this for your own good. Don\u2019t take his words for granted.\u201d a young man said and frowned at Wang Xian when he saw the expression on Director Zhou\u2019s face.\u201cThat\u2019s right. What can you do when you don\u2019t have any money? Girls are all looking for rich husbands who dote on them and love them. Too bad I\u2019m married. Otherwise, I\u2019d woo Director Zhou instead.\u201dA girl also glanced at Wang Xian. \u201cXiao Wang, you\u2019re still young.\u201dThey had been working in the society for many years, and they could sense something from their boss\u2019s expressions.They could tell that Director Zhou wanted to shame him. Naturally, they needed to give him a hand.A hint of sarcasm flashed in Wang Xian\u2019s eyes when he heard their remarks.\u201cWe\u2019re still schooling, and we don\u2019t have many troubling matters. We just need to pursue what we want, and that will do.\u201dGuan Shuqing spoke with a smile when she felt something was amiss with the atmosphere.\u201cShuqing, you are still young. Listen to me. I\u2019ll nag at you in the future,\u201d said a girl to Guan Shuqing.She was pleased to see the kindness in Director Zhou\u2019s eyes as soon as she finished her sentence.\u201cWaitress.\u201dAt this time, Director Zhou got an idea and called for the waitress at the door.\u201cSir, how may I help you?\u201d asked the waitress who walked over.\u201cDo you still have that limited caviar?\u201d asked Director Zhou to the waitress.\u201cI\u2019ll need to check with the kitchen,\u201d the waitress answered with a smile.\u201cOkay, please check for me.\u201d Director Zhou nodded unconcernedly. Subsequently, he told everyone, \u201cTruffle, foie gras, and caviar are the three most renowned overseas dishes. Caviar, in particular, is extremely precious. The caviar sold in First-grade Restaurant is limited edition and costs $4,000 per portion. Just enough for one or two people to share. The taste is superb. I\u2019ll see how many portions are available. We can order more, subject to availability.\u201d\u201cDirector Zhou, you\u2019re way too generous. The caviar is just too expensive.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Director Zhou. These dishes are enough. Why don\u2019t you order for Shuqing? You don\u2019t have to waste your money on us,\u201d said several sensible youngsters.\u201cWe will see how many portions are available.\u201d Director Zhou was satisfied with them after hearing them.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir, but our caviar is all out today.\u201d Soon, the waitress walked over and apologized.\u201cHur? Sold out? Oh, is Manager Huang around?\u201d asked Director Zhou with a frown.\u201cYes, Sir, do you have any requests?\u201d asked the waitress quickly.\u201cNothing, I\u2019ll give him a call.\u201d Director Zhou gestured at the waitress and fished for his phone.\u201cDirector Zhou, do you know the manager from the First-grade Restaurant?\u201d asked a young man with surprise.\u201cWe met each other over a couple of meals,\u201d Director Zhou said without any emotion, but his eyes glimmered with arrogance. \u201cI still know some people from during the few years after returning from overseas.\u201d\u201cDirector Zhou, you really befriend many people from all walks of life. That would give you the convenience to do anything.\u201d A young man at the side was licking his boots.\u201cNetwork is essential in society today,\u201d said Director Zhou smilingly as the phone on the opposite side rang.\u201cHello, Director Zhou, how are you?\u201d a middle-aged man\u2019s voice was heard on the phone.\u201cManager Huang, are you busy?\u201d asked Director Zhou with a smile.\u201cNot really, is there anything I can help you with, Director Zhou? How was your dinner today?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m quite pleased with it. I\u2019m calling you with regards to this too. Manager Huang, do you think you can get some caviar for us? Your staff said it is out of stock, but I have a craving for it. Do you think you can get some for me to host my guests? Haha.\u201d\u201cSure, the kitchen should have set some aside. There should be some left.\u201d\u201cGreat, sorry to trouble you, Manager Huang.\u201d Director Zhou deepened his smile as he hung up after making a few courtesy remarks.\u201cWell, the First-grade Restaurant will set aside some every day just in case. There are some left.\u201d Director Zhou chuckled. He cast his gaze at Guan Shuqing, \u201cGive it a try later, Shuqing. The taste is great.\u201d\u201cDirector Zhou, thank you for your treat. It must be expensive for this meal,\u201d Guan Shuqing said with a smile.\u201cIt didn\u2019t cost that much. Perhaps less than $10,000.\u201d Director Zhou shook his head. \u201cSo long as you enjoy the meal today. By the way, where did you and your friend plan to have your dinner at just now?\u201d\u201cWe were planning to cook outdoors at school,\u201d Guan Shuqing said with a smile.\u201cOutdoor cooking?\u201d Director Zhou paused and raised his eyebrows. \u201cSuch a hot day and you\u2019re going for outdoor cooking? There are many mosquitoes outside. Xiao Wang, you\u2019re not being understanding. Besides, it is not good for their skin if girls are smoked by the barbecue. If you\u2019re treating a girl to dinner, you must at least go for a decent restaurant.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of restaurant?\u201d Wang Xian noticed that Director Zhou was looking back at him, so he took a sip of water and asked impassively.\u201cThe First-grade Restaurant may be expensive for you since you are a student. But you should at least go to a franchise restaurant for a meal that is around $200 to $300. Outdoor cooking is inappropriate,\u201d Director Zhou looked at Guan Shuqing as he spoke, \u201cBesides, outdoor cooking is not safe. Shuqing, you better not go.\u201d\u201cHeh heh.\u201d Upon hearing his remarks, Wang Xian sneered at him.Director Zhou showed displeasure in his eyes when he heard the scornful laughter.\u201cDirector Zhou, let\u2019s dig in. It\u2019s getting late.\u201dSeeing that Wang Xian was unhappy, Guan Shuqing quickly tugged at his arm under the table.While doing so, her palm was caught in his palm nicely. A current seemed to run in her body, and she withdrew it immediately.Wang Xian peered at Guan Shuqing and chuckled. He did not persist further and laughed, \u201cHave some food. The seafood in the First-grade Restaurant is the best.\u201d\u201cOh, then have more food. You might not have any chance for it in the future,\u201d Director Zhou jeered.\u201cYes, thanks to Director Zhou for the treat today.\u201d Wang Xian drew his lips slightly and nodded. He picked up his chopsticks and continued with his food.Guan Shuqing was relieved when he saw Wang Xian enjoying his food. She hesitated and picked a piece of crab claw. With a smile, she said, \u201cTry this. This is delicious.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Wang Xian looked at her and nodded.\u201cReally\u2026 I\u2019m afraid you might not have the chance to try it again after this,\u201d a young man muttered when he saw Wang Xian\u2019s look.The voice was soft, but it was audible.However, Wang Xian was not bothered at all. He did not want to quibble with him since they were all Guan Shuqing\u2019s colleagues.At the same time, Manager Huang hung up Director Li\u2019s phone call and spoke to Director Li, who was clearing up his stuff at the side.\u201cBy the way,\u201d Director Li heard him and said, \u201cTurn that customer down. After that, go to the kitchen, get the additional caviar, and follow me to that private room. We\u2019re delivering to someone else.\u201d\u201cHur? Director Li, who are you giving it to?\u201d Manager Huang was slightly stunned as he asked in surprise.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYour future boss!\u201d Director Li looked at him and said, \u201cThe First-grade Restaurant will belong to this person from tomorrow onwards. You should get to know him first today.\u201d\u201cMy future boss?\u201d Manager Huang was surprised. He knew that Director Li had a deal with this person for taking over the First-grade Restaurant. But he did not expect that his future boss would be having dinner here today.\u201cOkay, Director Li, I\u2019ll explain it to the customer.\u201dManager Huang quickly nodded and walked to the kitchen. He would be asking the chef to prepare it with utmost effort. After all, this was prepared for their future boss!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He took out his phone and looked at it. \u201cIt\u2019s a phone call from the manager here. It should be about sending the food over.\u201dHe smiled and accepted the call after explaining.\u201cWhat? No more? Not a single bit is left?\u201d When Director Zhou received the call, he asked in shock.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Director Zhou. We don\u2019t have any caviar left in First-grade Seafood Restaurant as they have been ordered by some distinguished customer,\u201d Manager Huang explained over the phone. \u201cI will definitely reserve a serving for Director Zhou for your next visit!\u201d\u201cForget it then. If it\u2019s sold out, so be it!\u201d Director Zhou shook his head slightly and hung up the phone.\u201cWe probably won\u2019t get the chance this time. Manager Huang said that all the caviar has sold out.\u201dHe shrugged his shoulders and said to Guan Shuqing, \u201cThis time we didn\u2019t get it, next time I\u2019ll bring you along to get some.\u201dGuan Shuqing smiled and didn\u2019t reply as she didn\u2019t know how to.Bzz Bzz.At this moment, Wang Xian\u2019s phone also rang. He took out his phone and saw a phone call from Director Li. He accepted it immediately.\u201cBrother Wang Xian, which private lounge number are you in?\u201d\u201c203. Is there anything Director Li has for me?\u201d\u201cOh, nothing! I\u2019ll just come and disturb you for a moment.\u201dJust as Director Li finished his sentence, someone knocked on the door of the private lounge. Following which, the waitress opened the door.\u201cSorry for the interruption, Brother Wang Xian. I\u2019m here to serve you a speciality delicacy of our restaurant.\u201dDirector Li stood at the entrance of the door as he smiled and spoke to Wang Xian.Behind him was Manager Huang with the plates in his hand. As they walked in, Manager Huang looked towards Wang Xian and put on a radiant smile.\u201cDirector Wang, this is the speciality caviar of our restaurant. There are five servings in the kitchen and I have brought all of them here for you and your guests. Director Wang, you can call me Xiao Huang. I\u2019m the manager of First-grade Seafood Restaurant currently.\u201d [1]The middle-aged Manager Huang kept a very low profile. He carried the plates and placed the servings of caviar on the table in front of Wang Xian.Wang Xian was slightly shocked but quickly smiled and nodded his head. He looked at Director Li and said, \u201cThank you for your kind intentions, Director Li.\u201d\u201cPlease enjoy yourself, brother Wang Xian. I shall not be interrupting you any further.\u201d Director Li smiled at him.\u201cThank you.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head.\u201cDirector Wang, please enjoy yourself. Feel free to ask for me if there\u2019s anything.\u201dManager Huang bowed down. From the very beginning to the end, he didn\u2019t look at others and had his attention fixed on Wang Xian.Even as he left, he lowered his stance before turning around and walking out of the room.Director Zhou was dumbfounded and his eyes were opened widely. Just as he was about to say something, he noted that Manager Huang had not even looked over at all during the whole process. Suddenly, he felt a little embarrassed.As for the other young men and women, they were also shocked by what they had just seen.What\u2019s the situation?Who were those two people previously?That guy who served the caviar said that he is the manager of this place and Wang Xian could just call him Xiao Huang? Is he the same Manager Huang that Director Zhou had mentioned?They quickly turned their heads over and looked at Wang Xian.They saw five bowls of caviar beside him with each serving costing $4,000 and a total of $20,000.Moreover, this was something that even money might not be able to get.Even their Director Zhou had failed to order any despite giving Manager Huang a call.Yet, the manager sent over five bowls with profound reverence.This\u2026How can this be possible? Isn\u2019t he just a student?Guan Shuqing, who was just beside Wang Xian, also looked at him with astonishment. She noticed that she had more and more things that she couldn\u2019t understand about him.He was a poor student that had to work part-time frequently to earn his school fees and living expenses in the past.Currently, he rode a heavy-duty motorcycle and the clothes he wore weren\u2019t cheap either.However, this wasn\u2019t the most surprising thing to her. What really shocked her was the manager\u2019s attitude previously and the free food that was worth $20,000.\u201cWang Xian\u2026 You\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian and had a huge basket of questions to ask him. However, she did not know where to start asking.\u201cLet\u2019s eat. Let\u2019s see how the limited caviar of First-grade Seafood Restaurant will taste.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and passed over a bowl to her.\u201cWang Xian\u2026 This\u2026 Why would the manager of this place bring these over\u2026\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at the caviar Wang Xian placed in front of her and asked blankly.\u201cI bought this place.\u201d Wang Xian looked at her and continued, \u201cDirector Li, who came in previously, is the previous owner of First-grade Seafood Restaurant. We have reached a preliminary agreement and I\u2019ll be the boss of First-grade Seafood Restaurant at this time tomorrow. Therefore\u2026\u201dWang Xian smiled. As for Guan Shuqing, she was staring at Wang Xian with her eyes opened widely and filled with surprise.\u201cFirst-grade Seafood Restaurant\u2026 You bought it?\u201d She asked again in disbelief.\u201cYeah!\u201d Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head. \u201cIf you have something you would like to eat in the future, you can look for me. I\u2019ll just treat you to it.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Guan Shuqing was a little dumbfounded.\u201cHow can this be possible?\u201dAt this point, a young man sitting by the side couldn\u2019t contain his surprise and showed his disbelief.This student sitting right here bought First-grade Seafood Restaurant? This is First-grade Seafood Restaurant! How much will he need?$10 million or $20 million?This is First-grade Seafood Restaurant! How can anyone buy this place with just $10 million?The other young men and women around also showed their disbelief.They recalled what they had said to him previously: I\u2019m afraid you might not have the chance to try it again after this.Thinking back now, they felt a surge of heat over their face. This was a tight slap to their faces!Not only could he try it again, he even bought the whole restaurant.Their attention turned slowly to Director Zhou ad they realized that Director Zhou\u2019s expression was even more dramatic.His face was twitching constantly and his body was trembling slightly as he looked to Wang Xian.Playing a sucker and acting poor? What an obnoxious person!Director Zhou stared at Wang Xian and had various phrases surfacing in his mind. He gritted his teeth tightly.To be able to buy First-grade Seafood Restaurant, he definitely had several dozens of millions in assets. As for his family, they only had $50-$60 million in assets.Moreover, these were all under his father.Wang Xian glanced faintly at Director Zhou before saying directly to Guan Shuqing, \u201cI\u2019ll be taking over this place tomorrow. I wouldn\u2019t make changes to the manpower of this place but I might need a reliable person to manage the accounts of this place. I couldn\u2019t possibly be cooping myself up in this place. Will you come and help me out?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d When Guan Shuqing heard his words, her eyes flickered. She glanced at Director Zhou beside her and remarked, \u201cBut I\u2019ve already\u2026\u201dHowever when she looked at Wang Xian once again, she still nodded her head in hesitation. \u201cAlright, since you have asked, how could I reject your invitation?\u201d\u201cHehe, great. With you helping me out, I\u2019ll be saving myself a lot of trouble.\u201dWang Xian smiled.As for Director Zhou who was just beside her, his eyebrows twitched violently and he clenched his fist tightly upon seeing Guan Shuqing being poached away right in front of him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, he couldn\u2019t just flare up. This young man in front of him was able to buy First-grade Seafood Restaurant directly. He might have a strong backing.Damn his answer of having only a sister! Who is he trying to fool!Endnote:[1] Literal translation of \u201cXiao\u201d is little. Manager Huang added \u201cXiao\u201d to his surname to make Wang Xian feel less distant to him. At the same time, it\u2019s to show deference to someone more senior or with more authority.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If it weren\u2019t for you, I would have asked them to get lost.\u201d\u201cHur hur, the last thing you said was simply\u2026 I\u2019m speechless.\u201dWang Xian and Guan Shuqing walked out from the First-grade Restaurant exchanging words happily on the old street.The gathering was not over yet. But when Wang Xian handed the leftover caviar to Director Zhou just now, he smiled and said, \u201cDirector Zhou, this is the caviar that you asked for. Try it. Welcome to my restaurant in the future. Oh, this restaurant is not mine yet. So, you\u2019ve still got to pay for tonight\u2019s dinner.\u201dAfter he finished his sentence, Wang Xian called Guan Shuqing out.At that time, Director Zhou\u2019s face was looking extremely sulky!\u201cHeh, I need to apologize to you for offending your superior. Looks like you won\u2019t be getting your two-day wages. I\u2019ll compensate you for that.\u201d Wang Xian said with a smile.\u201cOf course, you have to compensate me.\u201dGuan Shuqing chuckled and looked over her shoulder at Wang Xian as she felt her heart warming.This was the first guy who made her happy, comfortable, and heart-warming.The feeling was not immense, but she was addicted to it.\u201cHop on.\u201dWang Xian rode his Harley motorcycle over and called out to Guan Shuqing.\u201cOkay.\u201d Guan Shuqing felt her heart thumping as she looked at him on the bike.She got on the bike. With some hesitation, she held out her arms and wrapped them around Wang Xian.Sensing a warm body closing up on him, Wang Xian\u2019s body stiffened up. Subsequently, he revealed a smiling face.\u201cSit tight, we\u2019re leaving.\u201dHe stepped on the accelerator and headed back to school. Soon, they arrived back at the female dormitory.\u201cSee you tomorrow. I\u2019ll pick you up over here.\u201dWang Xian waved to Guan Shuqing.\u201cOkay.\u201d Guan Shuqing nodded and waved back to him. Happily, she skipped her way back to her room.Wang Xian chuckled and drove back to the male dormitory.During that night, Wang Xian did not do any cultivating. Instead, he slept soundly.When he woke up the next day, it was past 8 AM. Wang Xian got up quickly and freshened up.When he picked up his phone, he saw an unread message.\u201cHur? Lan Qingyue again?\u201dWang Xian was taken by surprise when he saw the Wechat message. It was Lan Qingyue again. The same thing, she wanted to buy him dinner in appreciation for the previous incident.The message was sent out five minutes ago.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Chairman Lan. I\u2019ve been busy lately, and I really don\u2019t have time.\u201dWang Xian declined politely. Today, he was going to take over the First-grade Restaurant. In the next few days, he would be too busy for anything.He needed to handle the internal issues of First-grade Restaurant and its management issues.The Longxuan Restaurant is going to open soon beside the restaurant, and it was an outright act to steal business from him.After hearing the conversation between Director Li and that young man yesterday, Wang Xian knew that the other party had some capacity. Hence, he needed to prepare himself for it.After Wang Xian sent out the message, he packed up and brought the lobsters and swimming crabs downstairs.Within a room in a villa, the entire place was loaded with pink color.All the men in the Rivertown would not have imagined that the renowned Ice Queen, Chairman Lan Qingyue, would paint her room with such a girly color.Someone once said that every aloof girl fantasizes about fairy tales.Lan Qingyue lay with her stomach on the bed with a big-sized, pink teddy bear beside her.Ding!When her phone rang, she quickly opened her WeChat.\u201cRejected\u2026 He rejected me again.\u201d Lan Qingyue was a little lost.Yesterday, she guessed that he might really have something going on, and that was why he turned her down. Hence, she asked him again early in the morning, but little did she expect that she was being rejected again.On top of that, he replied that he would be busy lately!\u201cDoes he dislike me, so he doesn\u2019t want to see me? Or is he really that busy?\u201dLan Qingyue frowned and got up from the bed immediately to stare at herself in the mirror.Despite the fact that she just woke up without any make-up, her refined profile and her perfect figure were extremely seductive.\u201cIs my charm not attractive to him at all?\u201d For the first time, Lan Qingyue doubted her own charm.\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s have breakfast. I want to eat steamed dumplings.\u201dAfter fetching Guan Shuqing on his bike, together with Wang Xian, they headed towards the old street.\u201cSure, whatever the beautiful lady wants!\u201d\u201cWhat a glib tongue you got. If I wanted to eat your meat, would you cut yourself for me?\u201d\u201cYou are not that cruel. I\u2019m not the Tripitaka from Journey to the West.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m the wicked female monster. Haha!\u201dAs they cracked jokes, Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing reached a steamed dumpling shop. After breakfast, it was time to meet Director Li.When they reached First-grade Restaurant, the door was already opened.Director Li and Manager Huang were already here.\u201cDirector Wang.\u201d Upon seeing his arrival, Manager Huang went up to him immediately and greeted him with a beam on his face.\u201cGood morning, Manager Huang!\u201dWang Xian nodded and looked at Director Li, who was standing at the side.\u201cThe property deed and the deed of ownership transfer are ready. Apart from the past profits, everything in the restaurant belongs to you. We will be busy for the entire morning since we are going to the Property Management Bureau for the transfers of the property and other stuff.\u201d Director Li smiled when he saw Wang Xian.\u201cGreat, let me see the contract first.\u201d Wang Xian nodded.\u201cHere, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s nothing wrong with the contract.\u201dDirector Li handed the contract to him. Wang Xian took it and studied it carefully before he casually nodded his head.Next, they took Director Li\u2019s car to the Property Management Bureau, State Administration for Industry and Commerce, some departments in the bank to expedite the transfer procedures, including business licenses, and so on.After running around for the entire morning, Wang Xian transferred the balance amount to Director Li\u2019s account. Both of them shook hands, and the deal was sealed.\u201cBoss, Director Li did not take anything with him when he left. Everything is operating as usual for now. I\u2019ll take you over to meet the rest of the staff.\u201dAfter coming back from the bank, Manager Huang, who had been following around the entire morning, spoke to Wang Xian with enthusiasm.\u201cSure, let\u2019s get to know the restaurant. Also, all the staff positions will remain as they are now.\u201dWang Xian nodded. It was lunchtime when they reached the restaurant. Wang Xian called for Manager Huang and Guan Shuqing to have lunch at the First-grade Restaurant.Manager Huang knew Guan Shuqing too. She had worked as a greeter for more than half a month.When they met again, Manager Huang guessed she could be the Lady Boss in the future. Hence, he was proactive to serve Guan Shuqing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs such, Guan Shuqing felt lost when her previous manager fawned upon her in such a way.All these were because of the guy beside her.After lunch, Wang Xian toured the entire restaurant. Looking at the First-grade Restaurant, he felt a sense of achievement.This was his restaurant, and he would definitely make a name for this restaurant in the entire Rivertown, and it would be the best restaurant ever!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let us welcome our new boss, Director Wang.\u201dWithin First-grade Restaurant, Manager Huang gathered all the employees after they were done with their work in the restaurant at approximately three o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201cHello everyone, I\u2019m Wang Xian and will be the boss of this restaurant in the future.\u201dWang Xian walked up and smiled faintly at the crowd. The entire restaurant had fifty employees currently. The employee count was considered to be high among restaurants.Just the number of waitresses alone had reached thirty people.Similarly, this helped to guarantee service quality.\u201cSo young!\u201d A female waitress looked at Wang Xian and exclaimed when she couldn\u2019t contain her bewilderment.All the employees looked inquisitively at Wang Xian.Indeed, Wang Xian was too young to the point that he didn\u2019t look like a boss. They were all older than Wang Xian.Seeing this, Wang Xian lifted his head slightly and released a surge of Dragon Power towards them.\u201cThe restaurant will operate as always. Since I\u2019m taking over this place, I have to make some changes to this restaurant. The first change will be to increase all employees\u2019 base salary by 10%. Other rules will remain the same as for now. Don\u2019t think that I\u2019m easy to fool just because I\u2019m young. When I have to fire someone, I won\u2019t be soft.\u201d\u201cI have inquired about your jobs and salary. What I\u2019m trying to say is that your compensation will definitely be better now than it was with Director Li. I\u2019m more generous than Director Li.\u201dAs he spoke, he revealed a faint smile. \u201cIf you encounter any issues, you can look for Manager Huang or look for me directly. Everything could be discussed and I\u2019m easy to talk to. However, if anyone makes a mistake, I wouldn\u2019t be kind with my words either.\u201dAs Wang Xian spoke, the aura he emitted from his body made the atmosphere around him seem to have solidified.It was as though everything under the skies had him as the focus.The waitress, kitchen personnel, front desk personnel and other employees were all listening attentively.They could feel a sense of might that originated from the soul from the young man in front of them.\u201cAlright, you guys can go and have a good rest. Head chef, bring along another chef and Manager Huang to come and see me for a while.\u201dWang Xian looked towards them and instructed them.\u201cPhew!\u201d They felt like it was as though they had received an order and dispersed immediately. As they walked away, they were commenting softly.\u201cWhat the\u2026 Why does it feel like our current boss has an aura around him? He had a stronger majestic aura around him than Director Li.\u201d\u201cThe new boss is indeed generous to directly increase our salary by 10%. This is equivalent to $400-$500!\u201d\u201cWhat a young boss! He\u2019s probably just about twenty. However, the boss has a majestic aura around him. Could it be that he is a rich second-generation from a large family?\u201d\u201cThe boss is so handsome! Young, handsome and rich! So cool!\u201d\u201cDirector Wang, Director Wang.\u201dThe head chef brought a chef along and walked over as they addressed him with smiles. However, they were still a little reserved.Wang Xian was listening to the comments of his employees as he looked at the two chefs. He smiled and nodded his head.This was the impact he had envisioned. As a boss, he had to be able to control his employees first and make his employees respect and fear him a little at the same time.Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to manage the company effectively. Currently, he had achieved the impact he wanted.\u201cCome, I\u2019d like to know more about the operations of our current restaurant.\u201dWang Xian sat down with them at the waiting area by the side.\u201cDirector Wang, these are our supply channels and these are some unique dishes we offered.\u201dManager Huang took out a booklet and passed it to him.Wang Xian nodded his head. He had found out a little about these previously.What was outstanding about First-grade Restaurant was that the variety of seafood it offered was large. Moreover, the chefs had great culinary skills and the restaurant had great service quality and a good environment.For example, the caviar, Two-headed abalone and some precious seafood had a specialized purchaser. [1]It was the uncle of Director Li previously who was the specialized purchaser. Now that Director Li had left, he had also resigned.Nonetheless, the purchase channel was still intact.Precious items like caviar were purchased directly from overseas and the costs were high. As for ordinary seafood, they were purchased from the seafood market.Yellow croaker fish, true tunas and other precious seafood would have to be obtained from auctions by the sea. It would also be dependent on luck.\u201cDirector Wang, our contract with Golden Lobster Managing Company is about to end and will not be renewed. We have to find other channels quickly. Besides that, we have to purchase a batch of caviar soon. Also, we are running out of top-quality ingredients in the restaurant,\u201d Manager Huang said to Wang Xian.Although there weren\u2019t many customers who could afford top-quality ingredients, they were a symbol of strength and were a good publicity stunt.For example, if one restaurant has two-headed abalone, Atlantic blue marlin, yellow croaker fish, Australian lobsters, large lobsters and other kinds of top-quality seafood put up as display, and the other restaurant doesn\u2019t have such top-quality ingredients, this would be a distinct difference. One would have the impression that the first restaurant is better and the number of customers who would patronize it would be greater.Therefore, Wang Xian had to find some top-quality ingredients for now.\u201cThe supply of large lobsters from our seas is too little each day. Besides that, we don\u2019t have ingredients such as caviar.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head slightly.\u201cBoss, we have to go to the seafood market early in the morning to get those ingredients. As for top-quality seafood, they aren\u2019t in ample supply in the seafood market. Disregarding the high price of large lobsters and crabs, the quantity is limited too. Sometimes, we might not even be able to get it. If we use frozen ingredients, the taste would be a little worse off,\u201d the chef explained.\u201cLeave the supply of seafood to me.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head slightly and continued, \u201cAs for the rest, everything shall be the same as before. Besides that, Longxuan Restaurant would be opening soon. When they open for business, they will definitely organize some event. At that time, we must be able to keep up and play around with them.\u201d\u201cBoss, even if they wish to gain market share, we still have an advantage as our reputation has spread. As long as we can obtain sufficient top-quality seafood to attract traffic and maintain the quality of ordinary seafood, they would definitely not be a match for us.\u201d Manager Huang spoke confidently.\u201cGreat. Let me handle the issue of top-quality ingredients. Head chef, I\u2019ll leave the issue of the quality of ordinary seafood to you.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head.\u201cRest assured boss and leave it to us. The kitchen will ensure the quality of the seafood,\u201d guaranteed the head chef.\u201cAlright, if there are any issues in the future, come and look for me. It\u2019s fine too if it\u2019s relating to your everyday life.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and patted on the head chef\u2019s shoulders.\u201cThank you, boss.\u201d The head chef smiled.\u201cGet rid of these fish tanks for ornamental fish in the middle. I\u2019ll get bigger tanks and some ornamental fish,\u201d Wang Xian instructed as he looked at the empty fish tanks in the middle of the restaurant.The ornamental fish in them had been taken away by Director Li. It was initially used to keep the arowana that Director Li had borrowed from others.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was an easy task for Wang Xian to get these ornamental fish.At this point, he was considering if he should get some expensive ornamental fish to be used as a display.Endnote:[1] Two-Headed is a measure of the size and weight of abalone per catty (1 catty is approximately 500-600 grams) (i.e. If the total weight of 2 abalones is 1 catty, they are Two-headed abalone)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do I look like a professional?\u201d Wang Xian chuckled and asked in vain.\u201cYes, a little. Looks like you\u2019re going to be busy in the next few days. Where are you going to find top-quality ingredients? Do you want me to go with you?\u201d Guan Shuqing asked him with a smile.\u201cNot really. You have to run around to find them. Besides, the weather is hot. You will stay in the shop and keep a tab on my money.\u201d Wang Xian looked at her smilingly.\u201cWell, what\u2019s the matter with that? I can take hardship well.\u201d Guan Shuqing rolled eyes at him.\u201cI still cannot allow the belle of the University of Rivertown to run around outside and get tanned. Otherwise, I am committing a sin by doing so. I have ways to get those top-quality ingredients. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll get food-tasting first after I got them.\u201dWang Xian spoke with a smile.\u201cYou better be careful if you\u2019re asking me to try. I\u2019ll eat so much that your restaurant might go bankrupt,\u201d Guan Shuqing said with some slyness.\u201cHaha, if you really did it, then I have nothing to say.\u201d Wang Xian said with a smile.\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving in a while. Later, you\u2019ll learn the daily revenue and expenses from Manager Huang. After which, check on the inventory. I\u2019ll need you to look after my money in the future.\u201dHe continued joking.\u201cSure, go get busy.\u201d Guan Shuqing nodded to him.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you your wage in advance. Let me know if you need more in the future.\u201dWang Xian stood up and fished for his phone. He transferred $10,000 to her through WeChat.Guan Shuqing took out her phone immediately when she heard it buzz.However, Wang Xian took away her phone and received the money on her behalf. He smiled and said, \u201cIf you work for me, you\u2019ll get to enjoy life.\u201dWang Xian returned her phone to her and spoke teasingly.Guan Shuqing froze for a moment as she looked at the transaction on her WeChat. With a slight blush on her cheek she said, \u201cHmph, that would depend on my mood too. If the boss is nasty, I\u2019ll quit too.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Wang Xian grinned and waved to Guan Shuqing.\u201cGet going,\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at him and said.\u201cDirector Wang, see you. I\u2019ll take care of everything in the restaurant.\u201d On seeing that Wang Xian was about to leave, Manager Huang immediately walked over and saw him off.\u201cOkay, call me if there\u2019s anything. Work together with Guan Shuqing too.\u201d Wang Xian nodded.\u201cRest assured, Director Wang.\u201d Manager Huang nodded.After he left First-grade Restaurant, Wang Xian rode his Harley motorcycle to the seaside while thinking of ways to fish for the seafood.The restaurant required top-quality ingredients every day. Hence, he would need a large volume of seafood.There were many top-rated seafoods available in the domestic waters.Take lobster as an instance. Those who knew something about seafood would understand that the Australian lobsters were one of the average-priced lobsters.However, the price was jacked up to $200 to $250 for every catty in recent years. [1]Within China, several kinds of lobsters were more expensive than Australian lobsters like the Scalloped Spiny lobsters, Ornate Spiny lobsters, and Striped Spiny lobsters.But too many locals were foodies. Hence, the number of lobsters in China\u2019s domestic waters were left with very few of them. As such, they were too overpriced.In particular, the Chinese Ornate Spiny lobsters, also known as the Divine Lobsters or the Rainbow Lobsters, were jacked up to $5,000 to $6,000 for every 4 to 5 catties.In addition to the lobsters, the Wild Giant Yellow Croaker fish, and Chinese Bahaba fish found in China were expensive as well.3 catties of Wild Giant Yellow Croaker would cost about $8,000 to $12,000 for every catty.While the Chinese Bahaba fish cost a few million for each, its fish gelatine could fetch a scary price of hundreds of thousands of dollars.These fish could be found in the nearby waters around the country, but it had become so scarce that it was hard to find one in a few years.\u201cIf I can catch fish like Wild giant Yellow Croakers and Chinese Bahaba fish, it would give us some great publicity.\u201dWang Xian pondered to himself. Very soon, he came to the seaside. He parked his Harley motorcycle at the side and walked to a remote spot.He took off his clothes. With a swift movement, Wang Xian jumped into the water.\u201cTransform into Dragon.\u201dSplash!In just a move, Wang Xian turned into a two-meters long Divine Dragon. The Divine Dragon exuded strong and powerful strength as it swished its tail and dived into the ocean.I\u2019ll check out the Clam Girl first. She should have some transformation after the two-days cultivation, Wang Xian thought to himself and headed to the spot where the Clam Girl was.The golden tail swung, surging strong currents. On seeing Wang Xian swimming over, some of the surrounding marine animals were shuddering and dared not move.Some even fled in terror.Soon, Wang Xian arrived around the remote island in the middle of the ocean, sensing the position of the Clam Girl.Moving his body, he swam to the Clam Girl.Queen Clam: Level SixArt of Cultivation: Water Dragon TransformationSuperpower: Ability to control clam race whose level is lower than own existing level; Water Control\u201cNo changes to her level, but she has cultivated her own Superpower. She can control her own kind whose level is lower than hers, and water.\u201dWang Xian was surprised to see the Clam Girl\u2019s attributes. On top of that, the name of the Clam Girl was changed to Queen Clam.\u201cDragon King!\u201dSensing Wang Xian\u2019s arrival, the Clam Girl opened its shell and revealed the flesh inside.He was surprised to find that the flesh had gradually become humanoid. However, there were no limbs and face except for a simple embryonic form.Does that mean the Clam Girl will change into a human when her level gets higher?Wang Xian secretly thought to himself. He looked at the Clam Girl and commanded, \u201cClam Girl, show me your water control ability.\u201d\u201cYes, Dragon King!\u201dAfter sending the message to the Clam Girl, he found that the water around him began to surge.The surge was extremely powerful. Soon, he noticed that the sea water at the bottom of the ocean began to freeze.Boo!At this time, he saw a solidified water body appeared beside the Clam Girl. With her mind control, the ball of water was hurled forward.The ball of water was thrown off on the boulder at the side, leaving a dented mark on it.\u201cNot bad, the Clam Girl possesses a fair strength now. With her sturdy clamshell, the sharks might not necessarily be able to beat her.\u201d\u201cFollow me to the sea farther out,\u201d Wang Xian ordered the Clam Girl.\u201cYes, Dragon King.\u201dWang Xian nodded. He took the Clam Girl to the waters farther out.To his surprise, the Clam Girl was moving at a breakneck speed. Her water control ability allowed her to control the flow of water around her and accelerate her pace.\u201cShe just cultivates on the Water Dragon Transformation. As time goes by, she will be more powerful than now.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWang Xian looked and sped forward.A golden Divine Dragon, along with an odd and huge sea clam, were swimming freely in the vast ocean.Endnote:[1] 1 catty = ~500-600 gramsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wild grouper costs approximately $100 per catty currently.Tiger grouper! Wild tiger grouper costs approximately $200 per catty currently.While swimming in the seas, Wang Xian would spot precious fish from time to time. However, all these fish were devoured by him directly.As the quantity was too low or only one, it wouldn\u2019t be useful even if he had brought it to the restaurant.The truth was that within the seas, there was still a lot of fish that had a high value. However, the less common they were, the higher the value. High-value fish were often not available in large quantities.The Bohai Sea was one of the most shallow sea regions in the country and was only several dozens of meters deep. Currently, Wang Xian could dominate all marine animals that were within twenty meters of him using his Dragon Energy.The resources in nearby regions of the country are too scarce and couldn\u2019t be compared with the sea regions of Europe and the Americas.With such a large population and uncontrolled fishing, many marine animals were on the brink of extinction. The marine animals within the seas couldn\u2019t be compared with regions in other countries.There\u2019s a small school of fish right ahead.Wang Xian squinted his eyes and looked at the several hundreds of fish in front of him. Those should be black seabream, a common fish found in the Bohai Sea.Moving his body, he dominated the school of fish using his Dragon Power before the school of black seabream could react to the situation.\u201cDevour.\u201dWang Xian opened his mouth and started devouring the hundreds of black seabream one after another.Name: Wang XianRace: Human (Able to transform into a Dragon)Level: ThreeDragon Energy: 323/100,000Superpower: Dominate the marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animals that are lower than your own level)Devour any form of marine animals (For extraction of dragon energy)Art of Cultivation: Divine Dragon TransformationI still need a lot of Dragon Energy to reach Level Four but let\u2019s put aside the issue of leveling up and focus on finding some top-quality ingredients first.Wang Xian looked at his attributes and thought to himself. He looked at the clam girl behind him before heading forward.Eh, the place right ahead is really beautiful!The seafloor of the seas was broader and more magnificent. They also had a stranger landscape than those on the land.After swimming for about an hour, other than finding several large lobsters, he didn\u2019t see any other top-quality seafood. He looked ahead and noticed colorful reefs ahead of him.The entire seafloor was decorated with different colors. Under the illumination of the faint sunlight, it looked very magical.However, the landscape was very chaotic in that area with protruding rocks from time to time. Wang Xian also noticed that there were many torn fishnets around that area.If one drove a fishing boat over to fish in this chaotic coral reefs region with lots of sharp rocks, it would be over if his net got caught on the rocks and was cut open.Wang Xian accelerated and swam over and found fishing nets on many rocks.What Wang Xian didn\u2019t know was that this area was known as the \u201cChaotic Coral Reefs\u201d region by experienced fishermen in the Bohai Sea.The reason why it was known as such was that there were many submerged reefs in this area. It was also considered as the restricted ground for fishing.The resources around these areas are clearly more abundant.As Wang Xian approached the area, he immediately saw a school of pomfret. There were approximately 400-500 of them that were swimming in the vicinity.Moving his body, he encountered schools of fish and still chose to devour them.Boom!Wang Xian charged over and dominated the school of Level 0 pomfrets directly. After which, he turned them into Dragon Energy.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty here.\u201d After devouring the school of pomfrets, Wang Xian turned his attention to the entire coral reef region in front of him.Although the landscape wasn\u2019t smooth, it was of different colors and one couldn\u2019t hide the magical feeling this place was giving off.Wang Xian wiggled his body slightly and looked to the surroundings. He noticed that there were quite a number of jellyfish around.Jellyfish were poisonous marine animals. Strong jellyfish could even poison a person to death easily.However, only uniquely horrifying jellyfish would pose a threat to Wang Xian. As for ordinary jellyfish, Wang Xian wasn\u2019t wary at all.Wang Xian swam slowly towards the inner regions of the coral reefs.Eh, that should be scalloped spiny lobster. The current price of it is about $200 per catty.Wang Xian saw a lobster that weighed over a catty passing by. With just a thought, he controlled it with his Dragon Power and made it swim towards him.Swoosh!However, at this moment, a horrifying living animal emerged from the seafloor and bit on that scalloped spiny lobster directly.Crack crack!That monster bit onto the head of the lobster directly. In just a short while, it had killed the lobster.Wang Xian was slightly shocked and quickly turned his attention to that monster.\u201cThis is? Conger eel!\u201dWang Xian squinted his eyes. Conger eels were considered as violent animals just like an electric eel.Similarly to an electric eel, a conger eel was capable of discharging electricity. In addition, a conger eel was more horrifying than an electric eel.Conger eel was known for his tenacity and would even attack other types of fish.Wang Xian was scrutinizing this ingesting conger eel. It had a body that spanned 2.5 meters and a hideous-looking head. With just a single bite, it broke the shell of the lobster.Conger eel: Level ThreeExtractable Dragon Energy: 231A level three conger eel.Wang Xian opened his mouth slightly. At Level Three, his Dragon Power would not have a huge influence on the conger eel.He wiggled his tail slightly and opened up his claws. Jerking ahead, he attacked the conger eel directly.Swoosh!Just as Wang Xian charged over, the conger eel, which was 10 meters away, immediately lifted its head and looked at Wang Xian with a cold stare. At the same time, it was emanating a violent aura.At the same level, the divine dragon isn\u2019t afraid of any living animal.A cold look surfaced on Wang Xian while he did not reduce his attacking momentum.Growl!The conger eel opened its mouth widely and charged towards Wang Xian without hesitating.\u201cGo and die!\u201d Wang Xian extended his dragon claws and grabbed onto its head directly.Sss.However at this moment, a blue ray of light emitted from the conger eel\u2019s head. Within the glow was a strong electric current.At that instant, Wang Xian could feel his dragon claw going numb. His entire body even started shivering.Sss!The conger eel opened its mouth widely and bit towards Wang Xian\u2019s head.Growl!Giving out a soft roar, Wang Xian opened his mouth too and charged ahead.Crack, crack! He ripped the conger eel\u2019s head out with a bite and quickly devoured it.Seeking its own death!Wang Xian showed disdain at the Level Three conger eel which was being arrogant. At this moment, only a Level Five or Six conger eel would be able to deal with him.The coral reefs in this region are chaotic and everywhere. It\u2019s very suitable for lobsters and conger eels to survive. If there are more lobsters here, I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about getting top-quality lobsters in the restaurant.Wang Xian looked to the surroundings and instructed clam girl to search the surroundings.\u201cDragon King, there\u2019s a lobster right here!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euClam girl quickly brought him the news. Moving his body, he swam over directly.He saw clam girl had captured a lobster that was over 1 meter long.Ornate Spiny lobsters! It is the expensive Ornate Spiny lobsters and weighs about two catties. It seems like there would be quite an amount of lobsters in this area.Looking at this colorful lobster, excitement started filling Wang Xian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hence, it was not easy to spot them. If the lobsters remained still and hidden among the coral reefs, it would not be easy to spot them.After all, Wang Xian was only a tiny Divine Dragon. Without Divine Sense, he could not scan and check the surrounding situation.\u201cShould I upgrade my eyes with Dragon Energy so that they can have the Byakugan effect in Naruto\u2019s anime?\u201d [1]Wang Xian pondered to himself. He could use Dragon Energy to upgrade and strengthen any parts of his body, including the eyes. However, it would require a lot of Dragon Energy to do so.After some considerations, he gave up. His current level was too low, and he had too little of Dragon Energy.Wang Xian observed the surrounding with his sharp eyes. Some of the colorful fish were swimming around him.\u201cThere is a lobster over there. It should be the Painted Spiny lobster. The price for this is about $300 per catty. Not too low for it.\u201dThe Dragon Power enveloped the area, and Wang Xian commanded that Painted Spiny lobster to swim over.Looking at the 20-centimeters lobster, a smile surfaced on Wang Xian\u2019s face.Perhaps the lobsters here were suitable to supply for the use of his restaurant.\u201cHmm, there is a Conger eel.\u201dA cold smile surfaced when Wang Xian saw an eel roaming slowly between the corals.That was a Level-two eel which was smaller than the previous one just now.He swam over and devoured the eel which did not put up even the slightest resistance.\u201cCarry on with the search.\u201dOne by one, Wang Xian found the lobsters and caught 20 of them. All of them were controlled by the ability of the Clam Girl.\u201cIt only took about half an hour to catch 20 of them from this corner of the area. This entire zone with reefs and rocks seems like a treasure land.\u201dA glimmer of excitement flashed in Wang Xian\u2019s eyes. He moved forward and saw a huge coral reef in front of him.The entire reef was protruding out from the seabed for about five meters, and it was covered with colorful corals.\u201cWe should be able to find lobsters over there.\u201dWith a swift movement, Wang Xian swam over. When he was over there, he was stunned.Filled in between the crevices of the coral reefs were at least a few dozen lobsters, including Painted Spiny lobster, Ornate Spiny lobsters, and Chinese lobsters.\u201cAmong those, the biggest lobsters are Ornate Spiny lobsters. That must be at least 5 to 6 catties. This is a breeding ground for lobsters.\u201dIt was difficult to come across Ornate Spiny lobsters of such a size for decades. This was a region that had yet to be fish by anyone. As such, the number of lobsters here was beyond his expectation.Wang Xian was thrilled. With a jerk forward, he enveloped the area with his Dragon Energy and commanded the lobsters to follow behind.As the lobsters were moving slowly, Wang Xian had to reduce his speed too.He continued to swim forward and spotted a larger reef area ahead.\u201cBased on the experience just now, that might be a breeding ground for the lobsters.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s eyes brightened up as he led the lobsters to the coral reef.\u201cHur? This is\u2026!\u201dWhen he arrived at that reef, he was stunned by what he saw. Not many lobsters resided here.Instead, it was an Ornate Spiny lobster. Beside this lobster was a Conger eel and it was even larger than the one he met previously.The Conger eel was about 3.5 meters long and was considered to be a giant Conger eel.Its body was bulky and looked like an underwater monster.However, the eel was not the only one that shocked him. There was an Ornate Spiny lobster as well.The size of the lobster of at least 1.5 meters was beyond his expectation.In history, the largest lobster recorded was only 1.2 meters at 40 catties.The Ornate Spiny lobster before him should weigh about 50 catties at least.Its body seemed durable and robust, especially the pair of colorful lobster claws which looked like a sharp weapon.The colorful body seemed exceptionally noble too. However, this lobster was a little terrified as it was confronting the Conger eel before it.Conger eel: Level FourExtractable Dragon Energy: 548Ornate Spiny lobster: Level ThreeExtractable Dragon Energy: 346\u201cA Level-four Conger eel and a Level-three lobster!\u201dWang Xian was shocked by this terrifying Conger eel. Not even any of the ordinary sharks would dare to provoke it. This Level-three Ornate Spiny lobster was also out of his knowledge.\u201cThe ocean is really amazing; occupying a 70% surface area of Earth and with areas that were unknown to mankind. Besides that, various unbelievable species can be found in it.\u201dJust as Wang Xian exclaimed, the giant Conger eel struck at the Ornate Spiny lobster swiftly.The giant Ornate Spiny lobster lifted its claws hastily and lurched forward.Sst!At this time, the body of the Conger eel gave off blinding blue sparks.The Ornate Spiny lobster retreated speedily as it was fearful of the blue sparks.The Conger eel spun its heavy body around and lurched forward again.This time, the Ornate Spiny lobster raised its claws and clamped at the eel\u2019s body.\u201cWhat is the value of such a large lobster? It could be the greatest asset of the restaurant.\u201dWang Xian stared at the Ornate Spiny lobster with bright eyes. On seeing the offensive Conger eel, he moved his body and attacked it.Roar!Before the Conger eel could launch its attack, it quickly turned around and glared coldly at Wang Xian who struck.Wang Xian did not care. He was not afraid of a Level-four Conger eel.Bang, bang, bang!The Conger eel looked at Wang Xian with fear. Yet, its eyes were full of greed. With its body flashing with blue lights, it swept out to Wang Xian.\u201cIf the voltage from a Level-three Conger eel can cause numbness, the voltage from a Level-four Conger eel should be much stronger.\u201dWang Xian moved away and dodged the attack from the Conger eel. He extended out his claws and scratched the body of the eel.Sst!The sharp claws drew a long and bloody mark on the body.Roar!The Conger eel spun its head fiercely and rapidly. It opened its mouth which was full of teeth and bit on Wang Xian.Wang Xian raised its claws and charged forward.Crack!At the same time, blue sparks were flickering from the mouth of the Conger eel.Wang Xian was startled and ducked quickly.Shoo!Just then, he saw a water ball fired right into the mouth of the Conger eel.Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He knew it was the Clam Girl who had made her move. With a swift movement, the dragon claws grabbed the Conger eel by its neck. He opened the dragon mouth and bit down.Extracted 548 Dragon Energy.Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face. He looked at the Ornate Spiny lobster again with a sudden thought.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe lobster was fleeing in horror when it saw Wang Xian swallow the mighty Conger eel in one gulp.\u201cDon\u2019t think of escaping, Little Lobster.

Its actions looked extremely comical.\u201cStill trying to escape!\u201dWang Xian swayed his tail and caught up with this ornate spiny lobster directly and pointed his dragon claw at it.This lobster held up its large pincers in fear and looked at Wang Xian in horror with its pair of tiny eyes. He was petrified.That horrifying conger eel was its natural nemesis and was eaten by this golden-colored monster just a while ago. How could it possibly go up against this monster!Growl!Wang Xian let out a roar as he shrouded this lobster with his Dragon Power. The timid ornate spiny lobster shrivelled immediately. If its intelligence had manifested, it would definitely beg for mercy and claimed to have parents and kids to take care of.\u201cSubmit to me, the Dragon King!\u201dA supreme intention was directed into his mind. The ornate spiny lobster shrank its body instinctively and placed his large pincers down as it squatted in front of Wang Xian.\u201cThat\u2019s the way.\u201dWang Xian revealed a faint smile and opened his mouth gradually. A drop of dragon blood flew out from its mouth. The essence blood was emitting a golden glow and fell on the head of the ornate spiny lobster.\u201cDon\u2019t resist it!\u201d Wang Xian directed the words into his mind.The ornate spiny lobster didn\u2019t dare to move recklessly and simply stayed there without moving as the golden-colored dragon blood entered its body.\u201cSuccess!\u201d Wang Xian smiled. This ornate spiny lobster had become his second subordinate.Hmm. This lobster hasn\u2019t got its intelligence manifested and couldn\u2019t cultivate. I have to use dragon energy to upgrade it and manifest its intelligence for him to pick up cultivation arts.Wang Xian thought to himself. This lobster was different from the Clam girl. Clam girl already had her intelligence manifested. Therefore, Wang Xian didn\u2019t have to use dragon energy to manifest her intelligence after subduing her.Manifesting intelligence would exhaust a large amount of dragon energy.Wang Xian placed his dragon claw on the head of that ornate spiny lobster. Streams of dragon energy entered its body and strengthened its intelligence and body.Crack crack, crack crack!Cracking sounds came from the body of the ornate spiny lobsters. Glows of seven colours shimmered on its body as its body grew gradually to two meters.\u201cIt does look like a Divine Lobster!\u201d Wang Xian laughed as he saw the glow of the lobster.\u201cDragon King!\u201dJust as he had exhausted about 700 points of dragon energy, Wang Xian heard a faint will reach him.Wang Xian immediately stopped the upgrade using dragon energy and looked at the ornate spiny lobster. \u201cLittle lobster, is that you?\u201d\u201cDragon King, it\u2019s me.\u201d The ornate spiny lobster moved its long antennae as a response.\u201cHaha, great. I shall impart you a cultivation art. Hmm\u2026 Your claws are pretty sharp\u2026 In that case, I shall impart to you the cultivation arts of Metal Elemental Divine Dragon!\u201dWith just a thought, the cultivation arts of Metal Dragon, a part of Divine Dragon Transformation, was imparted on the ornate spiny lobster.Crawfish Soldier: Level 4Art of Cultivation: Metal Dragon TransformationSuperpower: Ability to control lobster race whose level is lower than own existing levelThrough the upgrades using dragon energy, ornate spiny lobster\u2019s level has increased by one. Moreover, its body also looks much stronger. This was because I have used dragon energy to upgrade it directly. This also allows it to awaken its first superpower to control a lobster race whose level is lower than its own existing level.Wang Xian looked at the superpower of Crawfish Soldier and excitement flashed in his eyes.This surprise was within his expectation. After subduing Clam girl, he did not use dragon energy to upgrade her abilities. She relied on herself to gather dragon energy and awakened two superpowers. One of them was the ability to control a clam race whose level was lower than her own existing level and the other was Water Control.As for Crawfish Soldier, Wang Xian used dragon energy to upgrade its abilities directly. This awakened its first superpower directly and allowed it to control a lobster race whose level was lower than its own existing level.This was the strength of the Divine Dragon that could suppress all things. With the Divine Dragon\u2019s bloodline, animals which practiced Divine Dragon Transformation could all possess the horrifying strength of suppressing its own race whose level is lower than its own.\u201cNow that I have two marine races subdued, let\u2019s just give you all a name. Clam girl shall be called Roving Girl and you shall be called Roving Lobster. Hehe!\u201dWang Xian smiled and looked at the Roving Lobster in front of him. He immediately instructed, \u201cGo and gather all the lobsters in the vicinity and bring them over.\u201d\u201cYes, Dragon King!\u201d Roving Lobster nodded his head before moving his body and scampering out.Although Roving Lobster looked a little comical while moving in water, its speed was five to six times faster than before.After the upgrades of dragon energy and obtaining the cultivation arts of Metal Dragon Transformation, this lobster was destined to roam the nine skies in the future.\u201cWith Roving Lobster, it would be more convenient to capture lobsters in the future.\u201dExcitement flashed in Wang Xian\u2019s eyes. This was one of the reasons why he didn\u2019t mind expending a large amount of dragon energy to upgrade a single Crawfish Soldier.Wang Xian waited quietly on the spot. After 40-50 minutes, he sensed Roving Lobster rushing over from a distant place.After another 10 minutes, he saw a two meters Rainbow Lobster headed towards him with two long antennae like a Divine Lobster.Behind him was a pod of densely packed large lobsters.Four species of lobsters, namely ornate spiny lobsters, scalloped spiny lobsters, Chinese lobsters and painted spiny lobsters, were separated into groups in front of him! The scene was grandiose and there were at least 10,000 of them.Wang Xian looked at this huge pod of lobsters in disbelief.\u201cDragon King!\u201d Roving Lobster swam to the side of Wang Xian and stopped on the rock respectfully.\u201cGreat. Haha, so many lobsters! I\u2019m rich! Just these 10,000 lobsters alone could be sold for several tens of millions.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s eyes lit up. Just these lobsters in front of him would bring him astronomical profits.\u201cThese are just lobsters in the vicinity. There are more at places further away,\u201d Roving Lobster said.\u201cHaha,\u201d Wang Xian laughed in ecstasy.These lobsters were marine animals without intelligence. Therefore, Wang Xian didn\u2019t feel a tinge of guilt for selling them for money.In the world of marine animals, large fish fed on small fish and small fish fed on shrimps. These were the primeval rules of survival.\u201cI won\u2019t be lacking supplies of lobsters for First-grade Restaurant in the future. Also, I\u2019ll be able to go look for other top-quality ingredients.\u201dWang Xian looked at the large pod of lobsters in front of him and revealed a smile.Within First-grade Restaurant, he had settled the supply of top-quality lobsters. However, this wouldn\u2019t be enough. He still had to look for other top-quality ingredients in order to make First-grade Restaurant become the best and most famous restaurant in Rivertown.\u201cRoving Lobster, cultivate diligently at this place. Roving Girl, follow me and continue with our search,\u201d Wang Xian said to the Roving Lobster. After which, he brought Roving Girl along and started exploring the surroundings.At this place, there were quite a number of other marine animals other than the large number of lobsters.Moreover, he wanted to see how large this region was and the approximate number of lobsters in the area.\u201cEh, that is?\u201dAfter roaming around the chaotic coral reefs area for two hours, Wang Xian still hadn\u2019t covered the entire region.Based on his estimates, this place had a radius of at least 30 kilometers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWang Xian finally found several precious fish after devouring and looking for top-quality ingredients for hours. They were wild giant yellow croaker fish!A total of five yellow croaker fish had a golden glow on the surface of their body and each one weighed 3-4 catties.\u201cI\u2019m so lucky today!\u201dMoving his body, Wang Xian swam over directly. He shrouded the five precious yellow croaker fish with his dragon power and suppressed them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Any one of them with a weight of 3 catties and above could fetch a price of $30,000 to $40,000.$10,000 per catty would definitely be the top-quality fish in the world.Wang Xian looked at the 10 Wild Giant Yellow Croakers that he dominated with a faint smile on his face.Having stayed in the ocean for more than 17 hours, the biggest benefit that he reaped was Roving Lobster and the lobsters. Besides that, he also acquired 10 Wild Giant Yellow Croakers.These Wild Giant Yellow Croakers were worth at least $300,000.Wang Xian did not bring all the lobsters up. Instead, he brought those Wild Giant Yellow Croakers back to shore.He got Roving Lobster to guard the entire lobsters\u2019 area and commanded Roving Girl to look for top-quality ingredients during her free time.Wang Xian transferred the image of abalones, Wild Giant Yellow Croaker, and Chinese Bahaba fish to Roving Girl so that she could search for them.After coming out of the sea, it was 9 am the next day. He touched his empty stomach, as he had already missed two meals in a day.Wang Xian put on his clothes and headed to the place where he had parked his Harley motorcycle.How nice it would be if I had a house by the sea. In this way, I wouldn\u2019t have to go through the trouble. It would be best to have a fish farm or fishing boat at sea. Next time, I can better explain the source of the seafood if I put them on the fishing boat.Wang Xian was pondering to himself. He took out his phone to check the price of fishing boats.There were several messages on the phone. In addition to Guan Shuqing\u2019s messages, there were messages from Xue Jing.Xue Jing sent him a message asking if he had time to meet. Subsequently, he followed up with some warm greetings again.Wang Xian chuckled after he saw these and returned a few polite replies.He rode all the way back to First-grade Restaurant and saw Guan Shuqing and Manager Huang exchanging conversations as soon as he entered the restaurant.On seeing him, Guan Shuqing was displeased and grumbled, \u201cWhere did you go? You didn\u2019t reply to my messages since yesterday.\u201dWang Xian saw some resentment flashing in her eyes. He chuckled and said, \u201cI have been busy, and I was too busy to look at my phone.\u201d\u201cWho will believe you? You\u2019re so busy that you can\u2019t even look at your phone?\u201d Guan Shuqing stared at him with disbelief.\u201cIt\u2019s true. I\u2019m not lying to you.\u201d Wang Xian walked over without a word and swung the bag of Wild Giant Yellow Croakers in his hand. \u201cTo get some seafood back, I was busy throughout the night. I didn\u2019t even sleep well last night. Manager Huang, bring it to the kitchen and keep it. We\u2019re not selling these for the time being.\u201dHe smiled to Guan Shuqing as he spoke to Manager Huang.\u201cYes, Director Wang.\u201d Manager Huang trotted over with curiosity as he took over the bag in Wang Xian\u2019s hand.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d When he saw the Giant Yellow Croakers, his eyes were wide open as he was taken aback. \u201cDirector Wang, this\u2026these are Giant Yellow Croakers?\u201d\u201cYes, Wild Giant Yellow Croaker. Keep them properly. They should be dying.\u201d Wang Xian nodded.\u201cSure, Director Wang. You\u2019re awesome. Wild Giant Yellow Croaker is so rare that it is hard to catch even one. You have got 10 of them, and each of them is at least 3 catties. Director Wang, you\u2019re simply superb.\u201dManager Huang spoke with surprise. Then, he quickly took the fish back to the kitchen.When the main chef saw the fish, he was also shocked. The new boss was awesome. He had managed to get 10 Wild Giant Yellow Croakers in just a day, and these are all the priceless top-quality ingredients.\u201cYou got 10 Wild Giant Yellow Croakers?\u201d asked Guan Shuqing shockingly as she knew about the scarcity of the Giant Yellow Croakers as well.\u201cYes, I got them through tremendous effort.\u201d Wang Xian nodded.\u201cWang Xian, you\u2019re now\u2026 superb!\u201d said Guan Shuqing with her mouth agape.\u201cHeh, it\u2019s nothing. You\u2019ll be well-fed if you follow my lead.\u201d Wang Xian smirked.\u201cYou\u2019re such an outstanding man now. I\u2019m sure many girls will take a fancy to you in the future.\u201d Suddenly, Guan Shuqing looked at him, feeling lost.\u201cHur?\u201d Wang Xian was slightly stunned. Subsequently, he joked and said, \u201cThat\u2019s for sure. Just that I\u2019m not sure if there is anyone as pretty as our Guan Shuqing who will take a fancy to me.\u201d\u201cWhat a glib tongue.\u201d Guan Shuqing heard his words and chuckled, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to check and make a comparison with the old data. I cannot take your salary for granted.\u201d\u201cI will also take a look at the office.\u201dWang Xian came to a small office with three tables. Among which, there was one desk that belonged to him.Wang Xian picked up the old data and studied it.The daily sales figure of First-grade Restaurant was about $150,000. Such turnover is considered to be high, at $50 million a year.Yet, the profit margin was minimal at 12% to 13% of the revenue.Expenses include taxes, staff wages, in-store expenses, and the procurement cost.With 50 employees, the staff wages cost almost $20,000. Procurement expenses were even higher than this.Take caviar for instance, there was basically no profit in selling it.The First-grade Restaurant could enjoy its reputation because of the excellent quality in the ingredients and the culinary skills of the chef.Director Li was a very enterprising person. He hired three award-winning \u2018Gold-medalist\u2019 chefs. The so-called \u2018Gold-medalist\u2019 chefs were chefs who were qualified to be the main chefs in five-star hotels.The yearly salary of these three cooks was around half a million.With the increase in cost, the reputation of the restaurant was on the rise too. Five to seven million profits in a year was considered high to a restaurant.An average restaurant would make more than 25% of profits. The First-grade Restaurant\u2019s profit margin is still relatively low. If we can double the profits, we will have $13 to $14 million in income.Wang Xian was thinking to himself. He remained confident with First-grade Restaurant. Once their top-quality ingredients were ready, they could make at least 35% profits.By that time, the yearly earnings could hit over $20 million.During the day, Wang Xian had been staying in the restaurant to study how to make money.Guan Shuqing was also looking at the various data.Ring!When Wang Xian was about to get Guan Shuqing for dinner at 6 pm, Guan Shuqing\u2019s phone rang.Soon after, he heard the reluctant voice of Guan Shuqing.\u201cWang Xian, I had to make a trip home,\u201d After she hung up the phone, Guan Shuqing had a troubled face. She apologized to Wang Xian, \u201cI might not be able to come tomorrow either. I\u2019m sorry. I just started my work for a day\u2026\u201d\u201cHur? What\u2019s up? Anything wrong?\u201d asked Wang Xian with concern. He was slightly stunned when he saw her expression.\u201cSomething about my parents. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Guan Shuqing replied with guilt.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Get going.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head and assured her.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll come back the day after.\u201d Guan Shuqing nodded.Wang Xian nodded as he did not take it to heart.Guan Shuqing\u2019s house was situated within an old district of the Eastern River District in the Rivertown. They used to be staying in a high-end, duplex residential building in the city center, but they had to sell their house to return the debt after her father\u2019s company encountered some problems and went bankrupt.\u201cDad, Mom?\u201d When she opened the door, Guan Shuqing saw her parents sitting on the sofa.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe middle-aged man was smoking, and his hair was a mess. The fact that he had turned from a billionaire to a penniless man had struck a huge blow to her father. Even her mother was impacted by this significantly.\u201cShuqing is here.\u201d the middle-aged man put out the cigarette in his hand immediately. He stood up and said, \u201cGet yourself dolled up. We\u2019re going to have dinner.\u201d\u201cCome, Shuqing. Wear something nice today.

Looking at the bright moon in the sky, she suddenly felt a little helpless.\u201cBrother Wu, Brother Wu. Please be careful.\u201dAt this moment, her father\u2019s voice sounded from behind her.He was walking in front of a middle-aged man and was constantly trying to get on the good books of the middle-aged man.The middle-aged man nodded his head arrogantly and patted on the shoulders of his father. \u201cAlright brother, if I can help, I\u2019ll definitely help you!\u201d\u201cThank you, Brother Wu.

Therefore, Wang Xian cleverly did not answer her question directly.Guan Shuqing was a little disappointed at this reply and she added immediately, \u201cIf you could earn $50 million within 3 years, is it okay if you marry me?\u201dCough cough! What the f*ck!Wang Xian was drinking water when he saw the reply and choked on it immediately. If he was surprised before, he was shocked now.What the f*ck! What\u2019s with Guan Shuqing today?! Why is she speaking so weirdly?\u00a0Is this a joke?Wang Xian was making guesses in his mind and felt that the weather was a little erratic the last few days. He answered in a jokingly manner, \u201cForget about three years. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem for me to earn $50 million within two years or perhaps even within a year! At that time, will I be able to take a great beauty like you as my wife? Hehehe!\u201dWhen Guan Shuqing saw Wang Xian\u2019s reply, she finally had a faint smile on her face. \u201cYes, you can.\u201d\u201cHaha, then you will be too simple. Wow! If the guys in school knew about it, wouldn\u2019t they die of envy? The goddess of the school would be marrying me!\u201d Wang Xian answered in a comical manner.\u201cYeah!\u201d When Guan Shuqing saw his reply, she smiled wider. She lay on her bed and replied, \u201cMy parents are asking for a guy I dislike to go out with me tomorrow. At that time, please accompany me.\u201d\u201cSure, absolutely not a problem.\u201d Wang Xian answered directly despite feeling that the message was a little strange.\u201cThen we have agreed on this. This baby is going to sleep now. Goodnight, Xiao Xian. I\u2019ll call you again in the morning. Remember to wake up early!\u201d [1]When Guan Shuqing sent that message out, her face turned red. Although Xiao Xian isn\u2019t as successful as Wu Family right now, if he could earn $50 million in 2-3 years and I use death to force my parents, my parents would definitely not pressure me further. Moreover, they would also likely agree to us being together. After all, Xiao Xian is so capable despite his young age.Oh my god!When Wang Xian saw Guan Shuqing\u2019s last message, he could no longer hold back his emotions as he jumped upright.Although their relationship wasn\u2019t bad, they were still addressing each other using their full name. He would address her as Guan Shuqing and she would address him as Wang Xian.With Guan Shuqing\u2019s personality, she wouldn\u2019t call him Xiao Xian and address herself as \u201cbaby\u201d to him.The last message made Wang Xian\u2019s heart palpitate violently.He scrolled through the conversation log between the two of them and started pondering the details.Firstly, something must have happened to Guan Shuqing on her way home. Secondly,\u2026Hehehe. Could it be that Guan Shuqing really likes me and that this was a confession?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHohoho~Wang Xian was in ecstasy.Endnote:[1] \u201cThis baby\u201d is a translation of Chinese lingo often used by the female party of a couple as an affectionate way of addressing herself to the male party of the couple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Looking at himself in the mirror, he was pleased.While fiddling with his hairstyle, his phone suddenly rang.Wang Xian spun around and picked up his phone quickly. When he saw Guan Shuqing\u2019s number, a smile surfaced on his face.\u201cHello, Pretty Guan!\u201d Wang Xian squinted his eyes and said.\u201cHave you woken up?\u201d\u201cYes, where are we going? Do you need me to pick you up?\u201d Wang Xian said with a smile.\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be going with the annoying guy. Oh, I forgot to tell you yesterday that you\u2019re acting as my boyfriend today. Do you have any issues with that?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure.\u201dWang Xian chuckled. He had a sleepless night as he was thinking of what Guan Shuqing meant by what she said yesterday.He was rather into Guan Shuqing.But he was neither someone who could chat with girls easily nor the proactive type. Otherwise, Qi Chuchu, whom he had been working together with, would have become his girlfriend.Wang Xian did not put much thought into this, but that did not mean that he did not have the desire.Now, he was fired up after Guan Shuqing tempted him.\u201cI\u2019ll send you the address. See you then!\u201dGuan Shuqing hung up after talking to him. Soon after, an address was sent to his WeChat.\u201cGuan Shuqing is back to herself today. That\u2019s odd. Women are always unpredictable.\u201dWang Xian shook his head. He knew Guan Shuqing must have encountered some problems. Otherwise, she would not have said such a thing yesterday.However, he still remembered that she promised to marry him if he earned $50 million. That was not a difficult task for the present Wang Xian.\u201cHur? Summer Sun Resort? Isn\u2019t that the property of Xue Jing and his family?\u201dUpon seeing the address sent by Guan Shuqing, Wang Xian was taken aback by surprise.\u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201dWang Xian laughed as he headed outside. He rode to the old street and had his breakfast before he rode off to the Summer Sun Resort.When he arrived at the Summer Sun Resort, it was only about 9 am. He came to the car park at the entrance and parked his motorcycle there.\u201cShould I tell Xue Jing?\u201dWang Xian hesitated. After some considerations, he decided to let it go to avoid unnecessary troubles.He put the keys back in his pocket and headed to the entrance.\u201cKite, don\u2019t run, stop!\u201dAt this time, Wang Xian heard a shout and a cheerful cry from a kid behind him.\u201cI want to play!\u201dA kiddish voice was heard, and Wang Xian felt someone knocking into him and hugging his leg from behind.\u201cWatch out, watch out!\u201dWang Xian turned around and saw a little boy hugging his thigh nervously.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I knocked into you. I almost fell too.\u201dAs Wang Xian turned around, the little boy lifted his head and looked at him shyly.\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Wang Xian looked at the cute and well-mannered boy, he could not help but to rub his head.\u201cLittle Kite, why are you running so fast? Wait for your Dad and Grandpa.\u201d A middle-aged man and an elder walked out from a campervan. Along with them were two young men who looked like bodyguards in suits.\u201cGrandpa, Dad. Let\u2019s hurry up and play.\u201d The little boy released Wang Xian\u2019s leg and continued to run inside.\u201cYou rascal.\u201d The middle-aged man sped up his pace and chased after him. He caught him in his arms, \u201cListen to me. Stop running.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t run, don\u2019t run.\u201dFollowing behind, the old man came along with a cane.Wang Xian smiled when he saw the cute little boy staggering as he ran. Then, Wang Xian headed for the resort.\u201cBrother Qin, Old Qin.\u201d At this time, another middle-aged man greeted them at the entrance.Isn\u2019t he the father of Xue Jing, Xue Jiahua? Wang Xian was a little surprised to see the middle-aged man.As Xue Jiahua was ushering the three people, he also saw Wang Xian. He was slightly taken aback before he walked over, \u201cBenefactor Wang Xian.\u201d\u201cJust call me Wang Xian.\u201d Wang Xian chuckled at the way he addressed him.\u201cSure, are you here for leisure?\u201d asked Xue Jiahua with a smile on his face.\u201cYes, I came here to look around.\u201d Wang Xian nodded.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I get Xiao Jing to accompany you around?\u201d answered Xue Jiahua hurriedly.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I have to wait for my friend. Mr. Xue, you can ignore me.\u201d Wang Xian smiled as he declined.\u201cSure, then I shall not bother you anymore. Enjoy yourself and let us know if you need anything.\u201d Xue Jiahua nodded hurriedly.\u201cAlright.\u201d Wang Xian nodded and headed inside.Xue Jiahua watched as Wang Xian entered. With a slight hesitation, he fished out his phone and texted his son to entertain Wang Xian eventually.\u201cBrother Xue!\u201dJust then, the middle-aged man, not far away, knit his eyebrows and called out for Xue Jiahua with the little boy in his arms.Just now, Xue Jiahua was supposed to greet them, but he cast them aside when he saw a young man. Such a way of doing things was impolite.However, they did not say anything. After all, they were here to ask for a favor.\u201cOld Qin, Brother Qin, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Xue Jiahua quickly responded to his calling by walking over quickly.In Rivertown, not many people were qualified for him to greet them personally. Old Qin was exceptional. Qin Family was much more influential than Xue Family. Hence, he did not dare to be a poor host.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. Just now, I met my benefactor. So I had to greet him personally.\u201d Xue Jiahua explained with apologies.\u201cOh? A benefactor?\u201d The middle-aged man looked at the figure in front of him with curiosity.\u201cNever mind, I heard that Old Xue not only regained his health, but he also made some improvements. I\u2019m here to check on him.\u201d Old Qin shook his cane, not minding at all.\u201cSure, Old Qin. My father is waiting inside. This way, please!\u201dXue Jiahua looked at the little boy in the arms of the middle-aged man. Naturally, he knew the purpose of Old Qin to come personally over here. Hence, he quickly led the way.Summer Sun Resort is quite a posh place.An usher was leading in front of him as Wang Xian observed the surroundings with slight surprise.The entire resort was luxurious, surrounded by rockery, streams, and a few trails. There were streams of crystal-clear water on both sides of the road with a myriad of fish swimming in it.Refined and posh-looking housing could be found ahead. Summer Sun Resort was situated near the sea. He could vaguely see the beach that was full of various activities like surfing.Not only that, there was a small restaurant on the sea with several tourists having their beverages.Surrounding the resorts were tall trees which made the place beautiful. There were some ponds with crystal-clear water too.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe entire place was relaxing, and the environment was elegant.\u201cIt\u2019s a five-star resort indeed. The environment is really awesome,\u201d Wang Xian exclaimed softly.\u201cSir, if you are waiting for your friends, you can rest in the waiting area for the time being.\u201dThe usher brought Wang Xian to a waiting area.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Moreover, she hadn\u2019t left her house.Wang Xian took out his phone and started playing to kill his boredom.\u201cBig Brother Wang Xian!\u201dAt this moment, a voice sounded. Under the astonishment looks of the ushers in the surrounding, their young boss was running towards a young man.\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Xian lifted his head and saw Xue Jing running towards him. He smiled and thought that Xue Jing was probably here under orders of his father.\u201cBig Brother, why didn\u2019t you let me know that you are coming? I would have come to pick you up at the entrance,\u201d Xue Jing ran over passionately and said.\u201cA friend invited me here so I didn\u2019t disturb you.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and answered Xue Jing.As the other party was so zealous and warm to him, he naturally would treat him with sincerity.\u201cYou aren\u2019t disturbing me. Not at all! I happened to be here anyway.\u201d Xue Jing laughed as he walked. \u201cBig Brother, are you waiting for someone?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m waiting for someone.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head.\u201cBig Brother, why don\u2019t I bring you around for a tour since you are free now? Moreover, my grandfather has asked me to thank you again. Since my grandfather was treated by you, he has made a breakthrough in his cultivation level,\u201d Xue Jing said with gratitude.\u201cReally? In that case, I\u2019ll have to congratulate Old Xue.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head with astonishment. Dragon Energy was a top-grade type of energy. While treating Old Xue\u2019s injuries, he also strengthened his heart. This was what allowed him to achieve the breakthrough.\u201cBig Brother, let me bring you around for a tour. I\u2019m guessing this is your first time here at our Summer Sun Resort. Let me introduce you to the various sites.\u201d Xue Jing asked.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be troubling you then.\u201d Wang Xian hesitated before nodding his head.\u201cNot at all!\u201d Xue Jing shook his head, stood up and led the way immediately.\u201cThis resort is pretty good and the area is pretty big,\u201d Wang Xian remarked while following behind Xue Jing and listening to his explanation.\u201cThis resort of ours is the largest in the entire province. Our Xue Family invested $1 billion to build it in the past. Currently, our Xue Family are relying on this resort and the five-star hotel in the city center,\u201d Xue Jing explained.Wang Xian nodded his head. Looking at this, Xue Family\u2019s assets should be at least a billion.There were many rich people in the country and many of these rich people were not known as they kept a low profile. Xue Family could be considered as a family that kept a rather low profile.They didn\u2019t have a lot of properties but their properties weren\u2019t small.The scenery by the seaside was extremely beautiful after modification. The resort houses in the vicinity were all luxurious and exquisite.Large trees and a clean swimming pool!There were various kinds of entertainment. The restaurant by the sea was a great place to go to in the resort. When winter came, there would even be a hot spring. This place was great for tours for all seasons in a year.\u201cBig Brother, would you like to go to the room at the side to take a break. My father and grandfather are both here today. If it\u2019s convenient for you, let\u2019s have lunch together today?\u201dThe Xue Family would like to make Wang Xian a friend. Xue Jing had also witnessed his strength and therefore tried to invite him and make him closer with them.Wang Xian also knew about the thoughts of Xue Jing and the Xue Family. Even though the other party wanted him as a friend, he wasn\u2019t against the idea. To him, there were still a lot of benefits from getting to know an additional friend.\u201cSure, my friend hasn\u2019t arrived yet. However, let\u2019s talk about lunch again later. If I have the time, I will definitely agree to it.\u201dWang Xian nodded his head.\u201cAlright, Big Brother Wang Xian, this way please.\u201d Excitement flashed past Xue Jing eyes as he replied quickly.\u201cBig Brother Wang Xian, the two most luxurious rooms of our resorts are here. One of them is this and the other just beside. You can come over directly with your Family Membership Card.\u201dXue Jing pointed at the two luxurious rooms as he explained.Wang Xian looked over and nodded his head. After which, he walked into one of the luxurious rooms.Within the room, Xue Jiahua was sitting in the main hall with a middle-aged man. The middle-aged man was smoking and had a worried look on him.\u201cBrother Wang Xian!\u201d When Xue Jiahua saw Wang Xian walk in, he was filled with surprise. He stood up immediately and went over to welcome him.\u201cMr. Xue, please take a seat!\u201d Wang Xian replied immediately.\u201cCome, come!\u201d Xue Jiahua smiled and nodded his head. He immediately took the teacup from the table, poured tea in it and passed it to Wang Xian personally. \u201cBrother Wang Xian, take a seat too.\u201d\u201cSorry for disturbing Mr. Xue.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head. He felt a little weird about his enthusiasm as he sat down.\u201cNot at all, not at all!\u201d Xue Jiahua waved his hand immediately. \u201cAuthentic longjing tea, have a try!\u201d\u201cMm. I won\u2019t stand on ceremony then.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head.The middle-aged man by the side looked at Wang Xian with surprise.This was the second time he saw Wang Xian. He met him for the first time at the entrance and Xue Jiahua left them aside just to greet this young man.Xue Jiahua even poured him tea personally and addressed him with deference!Even when facing his own father, he had never been so enthusiastic!He looked over inquisitively.Waa, waa, waa!At this moment, the crying sounds of a child propagated over. Soon after, a guy with his upper body naked ran out of the room.\u201cLittle Kite, don\u2019t run! Grandpa will bring you out to play! Let\u2019s go!\u201dBehind him, an old man with a walking stick walked out and called to the little guy.\u201cDad, so itchy and pain!\u201d The little guy looked at his father and ran over with tears all over his face.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, everything will be fine soon, my son!\u201d The middle-aged man carried the little guy, patted his back and was consoling him.Wang Xian looked at the small boy inquisitively. He noticed that his entire body was strangely red.\u201cBrother Wang Xian, you are here?\u201d Old Xue walked out of the room and saw Wang Xian. He had a shocked expression as he quickly made his way over.\u201cOld Xue, sorry for bothering you.\u201d Wang Xian nodded at Xue Liangren. Clearly, he didn\u2019t know that Wang Xian had come.\u201cFather, we happened to meet while fetching Old Qin previously. Therefore, I asked Xue Jing to go and receive him.\u201d Xue Jiahua stood up, walked to his father\u2019s side and spoke softly.Mm. Xue Liangren\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cWaa, waa. Dad, so hot, so hot\u2026 Let\u2019s go swimming\u2026 swimming.\u201dThe crying sounds of that little boy sounded once again. He choked for a moment but soon started crying loudly again.Wang Xian\u2019s attention was once again attracted by that little boy. He frowned and hesitated before extending his hand over. \u201cHey pal, come and let brother take a look.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d When the middle-aged man heard Wang Xian, he frowned.Old Qin, who had a walking stick with him, looked at Wang Xian with doubts on his face.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, Xue Liangren was stunned. He commented immediately, \u201cQuick! Xiao Qin, come and let Brother Wang Xian take a look.\u201dWhen the middle-aged man heard Old Xue, he was slightly shocked and turned to his father.Old Qin also looked at Old Xue in surprise.However, Old Xue wasn\u2019t paying attention as he introduced the little one to Wang Xian. \u201cBrother Wang Xia, Little Kite is Old Qin\u2019s grandson.

He walked over and asked the question softly when he saw Wang Xian reach out to touch his grandson.\u201cA young expert!\u201dOld Xue paused before he uttered the words to Old Qin.Old Qin was slightly stunned. A young expert? The term coming out from Old Xue was extremely unusual given that his strength was ranked top five in Rivertown. Moreover, he had made a breakthrough in his strength too.As such, he looked at the juvenile with surprise.Wang Xian found out about the little boy\u2019s condition after he injected some Dragon Energy into his body.There was something congenital growing in his right kidney, and it connected his kidneys together. This caused kidney failure for the little boy.Just now, Old Xue must have been using his Internal Energy to nourish him so as to alleviate the problem.However, this was not a long-term solution, and it did not resolve the root problem.I can remove it with my Dragon Energy, but it would consume 50 to 60 points.Wang Xian pondered to himself as he lifted his chin to look at the two elders.\u201cWang Xian, can you treat the grandson of Old Qin?\u201d\u201cYoung chap, any ways to do it?\u201dThe two elders asked Wang Xian quickly. Old Qin, in particular, was looking forward to his answer.Wang Xian nodded slowly. \u201cYes, there is a way.\u201d\u201cReally, can you really cure my grandson\u2019s disease?\u201d Upon hearing Wang Xian, the hand that was holding on to the cane was trembling as Old Qin asked once again in disbelief.\u201cMaster, you\u2026 you can save my son.\u201d the middle-aged man stood up suddenly and said in excitement.\u201cYes, I can do it now.\u201d Wang Xian nodded.\u201cSo long as you can cure him, the entire Qin Family would be grateful to you. I hope you can save my grandson.\u201d Old Qin\u2019s cheeks blushed slightly as he clenched his cane tightly when he heard Wang Xian.\u201cSure!\u201dWang Xian stroked the head of the little fellow and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll cure your disease.\u201d\u201cBrother, can you really cure me?\u201d The little fellow was looking at him as his eyes got redder.\u201cYes, of course. It will be done in a while.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and carried him up. \u201c10 minutes. Just give me 10 minutes.\u201d\u201cWang Xian, you can use this room. We\u2019ll not disturb you,\u201d Old Xue said hurriedly.\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Xian nodded and carried the little boy into the room.The little boy was obedient as he stared blankly at Wang Xian. He was looking forward to it with his glimmering eyes.Wang Xian entered the room because he wanted to avoid setting the world on fire since getting the little boy fixed only took a few seconds.He had to stay under the radar. After all, he had yet to become invincible.\u201cOld Xue, can he\u2026can he really do it?\u201d Old Qin watched as Wang Xian carried his grandson into the room. Then he turned to Old Xue and uttered words that do not hang together.\u201cIf he said he can, he can,\u201d Old Xue confidently nodded. He looked at Old Qin. \u201cOld Qin, your luck is good today since you managed to meet Wang Xian. Relax, am I not looking good now?\u201dOld Xue spoke with a smile on his face.Old Qin was slightly stunned by his words. He stared with his eyes wide open. \u201cOld Xue, are you saying that your injury was\u2026was\u2026\u201dOld Qin smiled and nodded.Old Qin had a change in his expression. He looked to that room with great surprise.Apart from him, everyone in the Rivertown knew about Old Xue. He had sustained severe injuries and visited many doctors for them. But, it was pronounced that he could not live for more than two years.Everyone in Rivertown thought the Xue Family would eventually fall, but no one expected that the old Master of the Xue Family would recover and make improvements in his strength.This surprised everyone.When Old Qin heard about this, he brought his grandson to Old Xue so that he could help to alleviate the illness.Never did he expect that he would have such an amazing encounter.\u201cKite has hope, Dad. Kite has hope!\u201d The middle-aged man at the side was overjoyed at their unexpected good fortune. He was so happy that he acted like a kid.The eyes of Old Qin were full of thrills as he nodded slowly. The entire Qin Family had work painstakingly hard for their only grandson. Finally, they were relieved of it.\u201cOld Xue, how did you repay him back then?\u201d Old Qin looked at Old Xue hesitantly and consulted him.\u201cRepay?\u201d Old Xue smiled, \u201cBack then, it was a coincidence. My grandson, Xiao Jing, offended Wang Xian accidentally. So, I gave him $10 million as compensation. However, Wang Xian was kind-hearted. He took the money as my medical fees.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Old Qin was stupefied. How could such a good thing happen?\u201cWang Xian is a kind-hearted person.

If you need any help, please let me know.\u201d Old Qin nodded his head and spoke to Old Xue gratefully.\u201cSure.\u201d Old Xue was taken aback by surprise. The Qin Family might not come from the background of an Ancient Martial Artist Family, but they had the most robust backings, even from the government.Even the Ancient Martial Artist Families would not dare to offend the Qin Family.\u201cBrother, you\u2019re awesome. I\u2019m not feeling sick anymore.\u201dA kiddish voice interrupted the people in the living room.Old Qin and the middle-aged man spun around and saw the smiling Little Kite. His cheeks were rosy as he pulled Wang Xian\u2019s hand and walked out of the room happily.\u201cLittle Kite!\u201d The old man and the middle-aged man walked over quickly with faces full of surprises.\u201cGrandpa, Dad, bring me out. I want to go swimming.\u201d The little boy grinned as he spoke.\u201cSure. Sure.\u201d The middle-aged man carried the little boy in his arms and kissed him hard on the cheek.Standing at the side, tears welled up in Old Qin\u2019s eyes. His grandson\u2019s health had always been a load on his mind.\u201cWang Xian, thank you for saving my grandson. Thank you!\u201d Old Qin looked at Wang Xian and bowed to him.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. He is cute too.\u201d Wang Xian laughed and shook his head. When he was treating the kid with his Dragon Energy, he accidentally obtained a thing from the stuff the kid spat out. It was a total surprise to him.\u201cBrother, I\u2019m handsome, not cute,\u201d the little boy turned to him and said.\u201cThank him now,\u201d the middle-aged man told Little Kite. His son was born when he was in his mid-years. His greatest wish was to see his son growing up healthily.\u201cThank you, Brother.\u201d The little boy grinned.\u201cWang Xian, these are the medical fees for my grandson. It\u2019s not a lot, but it is a token of my appreciation. The pin number is the last six digits behind the card.\u201dOld Qin took out a card that he just prepared and handed it respectfully to Wang Xian. \u201cI, Qin Guohui, have some power in Rivertown. If you need any help in the future, you can call me directly.

You don\u2019t have to take the rest seriously.\u201dWang Xian took the card with a smile. Firstly, the boy was cute and well-behaved. Secondly, he did this for the money. He was only left with $5 million. It was nothing less, but not a lot. Hence, he depleted some of his Dragon Energy just to treat the boy.Besides, he could make some friends and build his network.At the same time, he obtained a treasure unexpectedly.

This is still the first time I\u2019ve known someone as powerful as you are in Rivertown.\u201d\u201cOld Qin, you\u2019re really humble. I\u2019m not as powerful as you might think. It\u2019s just some simple medical techniques. I was from Pengzhou. If there aren\u2019t any accidents, I might very well stay in Rivertown for a long period.\u201d\u201cHehe. If your medical techniques were simple, there wouldn\u2019t be any great techniques. Sacred Followers Guild and Disciples of the Medical Saint aren\u2019t as great as their reputation would suggest.\u201d\u201cWang Xian is indeed great in this. For my son\u2019s illness, I have consulted almost all the hospitals from the North to the South.\u201d\u201cA doctor typically has a kind heart. The reason why Brother Wang Xian has such extraordinary medical techniques has very much to do with his young chivalrous heart.\u201d\u201cYou guys are praising me to the skies! I\u2019m just 20 years old and couldn\u2019t take all these compliments. Otherwise, I\u2019ll get arrogant. Haha.\u201dWang Xian was chatting with Old Qin and Old Xue in the living room. Xue Jiahua and Old Qin\u2019s son had the intention to get on the good books of Wang Xian as they went along with the conversation.As for Xue Jing, he had nothing to contribute at all nor did he dare to interrupt. All he did was to pour tea for others and laugh along.For Old Qin and Old Xue, they were in an authoritative position with extraordinary backgrounds. They naturally had an \u201caura\u201d around them. As for Wang Xian, he wasn\u2019t uncomfortable while chatting easily with Old Xue and Old Qin. as he had the disposition of the Divine Dragon.Xue Jiahua and the middle-aged man were a little surprised that Wang Xian was able to chat care freely with their fathers at such a young age. This was something that they couldn\u2019t do themselves.Among the younger generation in Rivertown, there was no one that could be compared with him.\u201cI heard from Xiao Jing that Wang Xian is now operating a restaurant. May I know where is it located so I can go and get some food when we are free? Hehe,\u201d laughed Old Xue.\u201cI bought over an operating restaurant. It\u2019s in the vicinity of the University of Rivertown. I believe Old Xue and Old Qin might have heard of it before. It\u2019s called First-grade Restaurant.\u201d Wang Xian replied.\u201cOh? First-grade Restaurant? I would have never thought that Brother Wang Xian has bought over First-grade Restaurant. This restaurant is rather famous in Rivertown. In that case, we will pay you a visit when we have the time!\u201d Old Qin remarked with a tinge of surprise.\u201cSure, not a problem! You\u2019ll be more than welcome. When you guys are coming, remember to give me a notice in advance so I can make some preparations for you.\u201d Wang Xian laughed.\u201cHaha. Great! Great!\u201d Old Xue and Old Qin nodded their heads. They were naturally happy that they were able to make friends with an extraordinary person like Wang Xian.As for Wang Xian, he had a good impression of Old Xue and Old Qin. One could tell the qualities of another person by the way they spoke and behaved. Moreover, he had a joyous chat with them too.\u201cOh right! Brother Wang Xian, I\u2019ll be hosting a banquet tonight. At that time, there will be many elites of Rivertown. If you are free, do join us.\u201d Old Qin invited him all of a sudden.\u201cI don\u2019t really know anyone so I guess I\u2019ll not be going.\u201d Wang Xian was taken aback slightly and shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s enough to just know these two old men right here. At that time, Old Xue would bring his family along too. Since Brother Wang Xian would like to grow in Rivertown, it would still be beneficial to get to know more people.\u201d Old Qin smiled.\u201cHmm. Alright.\u201d Wang Xian hesitated for a while before nodding his head.\u201cAlright. Do you want to have lunch with us in the afternoon?\u201d suggested Old Qin.\u201cThis might not be possible,\u201d Wang Xian replied apologetically. \u201cI came over here to look around while I was waiting for a friend. It might not be possible in a while\u2026\u201dAs he spoke, his phone in his pocket suddenly rang.\u201cHaha, since Brother Wang Xian has things to attend to, just go ahead. We will be fine. Let\u2019s go to your restaurant for a meal when I\u2019ve arranged a time with Old Qin,\u201d Old Xue smiled and said.\u201cYeah, go ahead and attend to your matters.\u201dWang Xian smiled and turned on his phone. It was a message from Guan Shuqing.After reading the message, Wang Xian looked at them. \u201cOld Qin, Old Xue. My friend has just sent me a message so I have to rush over. Sorry about that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just go. Let\u2019s have a chat again when you are free.\u201dWang Xian nodded his head and headed out.\u201cBig Brother, let me send you over. I\u2019m familiar with the place. Where is your friend currently?\u201d Xue Jing came over and asked him directly.\u201cSea Cloud Pavilion 101 private lounge. It\u2019s near the sea,\u201d Wang Xian looked at Xue Jing and said.\u201cAlright! Big Brother, please follow me.\u201d Xue Jing smiled and went ahead to lead the way.Along the beach, there was a row of tree houses. It was neatly arranged and looked extremely beautiful.\u201cBig Brother, this is our Sea Cloud Pavilion 101 private lounge.\u201d Xue Jing pointed to a small tree house.\u201cAlright.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head, took out his phone and gave Guan Shuqing a call.Creak!Soon, the door to the private lounge opened. Guan Shuqing, who was wearing a short-sleeve white shirt and black casual shorts walked out from the room.\u201cWang Xian!\u201dGuan Shuqing\u2019s expression didn\u2019t seem fine. When she saw Wang Xian, she forced a faint smile on her face.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Wang Xian asked, concerned upon seeing her unusual self.\u201cNot\u2026 Nothing.\u201d Guan Shuqing shook her head and said apologetically, \u201cIt might be tough on you in a while. It\u2019s all my fault!\u201dHmm? What happened? Wang Xian frowned.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Beauty Guan? Invite your boyfriend in!\u201d At this moment, an impatient male voice sounded from the room.Guan Shuqing\u2019s expression changed slightly.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201d Wang Xian lifted one of his eyebrows. He walked beside Guan Shuqing and patted her softly on her back.Guan Shuqing felt a stream of warmth in her eyes. With shimmering eyes, she looked at him. After hesitating for just a moment, she extended her arms over and wrapped them over his arm.Wang Xian\u2019s heart skipped a beat and the edge of his mouth arched up. He walked into the room with a face of smiles with Guan Shuqing.When he entered the room, Wang Xian saw four young men and three young girls sitting in the room.When the man sitting by the entrance saw Guan Shuqing come in with Wang Xian with her arms around his, gloominess flashed in his eyes.\u201cHello, everyone.\u201d Wang Xian smiled at them.The four young men in the room started scrutinizing him without reserve.\u201cEh? Wang Xian?\u201d Suddenly, one of the girls had a shocked expression and exclaimed out loud.\u201cHmm? Mei\u2019er, you know him?\u201d the young man beside the girl asked in bewilderment.\u201cOf course, we are classmates!\u201d The girl whose name was Mei\u2019er clung onto the young man while revealing a deep cleavage to him. She then added, \u201cJust a poor brat and student in the school.\u201d\u201cIs it?\u201d When the young man heard her reply, he was a little surprised.\u201cOf course.\u201d Mei\u2019er nodded her head. She turned to Wang Xian with a mocking smile and asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it Wang Xian?\u201dWang Xian smiled and shrugged his shoulders. Disdain flashed in his eyes as he remarked, \u201cSu Mei\u2019er is indeed true to the rumors spreading within the school.\u201dAs he spoke, he sat down in one of the chairs by the side without fear.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Su Mei\u2019er was triggered suddenly and stared at him with outrage.\u201cI mean nothing? What did I just say?\u201d Wang Xian maintained his smile while replying.Su Mei\u2019er was known to be flirtatious in school and changed her boyfriend frequently. Moreover, her boyfriends were all guys from a rich family. Who would have expected her to cling onto a young man outside of school at this moment?\u201cLad, you\u2019re pretty arrogant to insult my girlfriend the moment you came in,\u201d the young man in front of Su Mei\u2019er said coldly.\u201cDid I? In that case, is her calling me a poor guy an insult?\u201dWang Xian smiled.\u201cWhat I\u2019ve said is the truth!\u201d Su Mei\u2019er exclaimed angrily at him.\u201cDid I tell a lie then?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWang Xian spoke plainly to Su Mei\u2019er. He leaned back in the chair nonchalantly and looked at all the people around him.When he saw Guan Shuqing\u2019s embarrassed look previously, he knew that she must have been treated unfairly but didn\u2019t dare to retort.In that case, he had no intention or need to be respectful and polite to the people in the room.Let\u2019s just be arrogant then!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re fit to talk big.\u201dWith a cigarette in his hand, a young man in the center was staring at Wang Xian impassively upon seeing Wang Xian\u2019s attitude.\u201cA poor schoolboy is such an arrogance. What a courageous fool. Guan Shuqing, what a good boyfriend you\u2019ve got.\u201dThe young man beside Su Mei\u2019er jeered as he looked at Guan Shuqing.\u201cShuqing, is this your taste?\u201d Wu Chen, who was sitting beside Guan Shuqing was staring coldly at Wang Xian with a ferocious look in his eyes.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Guan Shuqing was looking pale.She thought it was only her and Wu Chen today, and she was not expecting him to call his friends. That ruined her plan completely.In particular, those friends of Wu Chen were all from affluent families in the Rivertown. The young man sitting in the center, especially, had an even more daunting background and status.Any one of them in the room was not someone Wang Xian could mess around with. Suddenly, she regretted. What if this bunch of people decided to hurt Wang Xian because of her\u2026Guan Shuqing stretched out her hand and tugged at Wang Xian\u2019s arm.Sensing the palm under the table, Wang Xian held her hand and gave her an assuring smile.Guan Shuqing went stiff as she felt touched, and at the same time, worried too.\u201cShe has great taste!\u201d Wang Xian smiled and turned around to look at Wu Chen. He observed him from head to toe, \u201cAt least, I\u2019m more handsome than you!\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dOn hearing his words, Wu Chen banged the table with his hand. He stared at Wang Xian. \u201cLad, I\u2019m telling you to leave Shuqing now. Otherwise, there will be a corpse found in the Bohai Sea.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re in way over your head. You can\u2019t even estimate your capability.\u201d Su Mei\u2019er jeered at Wang Xian on hearing what he said to Wu Chen.\u201cHaha, you guys are awesome since you\u2019re asking for my life without any reason. What a great society. Since you\u2019re a well-known figure in society, why don\u2019t you introduce yourself.\u201dWang Xian turned cold as he heard Wu Chen. Subsequently, he laughed.\u201cRemember, my name is Wu Chen, the heir to the Wu\u2019s Group.\u201d Wu Chen answered Wang Xian emotionlessly.\u201cGong Family in Rivertown,\u201d the young man next to Su Mei\u2019er said with a smile.\u201cSong Family in Rivertown.\u201d Another young man spoke smilingly.The young man in the middle chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m Bi Xiuming, you can find out about me yourself.\u201d\u201cWu\u2019s Group, Gong Family, Song Family, another one gave me a name to find out myself. You guys are awesome!\u201dWang Xian placed his hand slowly on the table while staring at the four of them with a beaming face.\u201cXiao Xian, don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t act recklessly!\u201d Upon seeing Wang Xian\u2019s action, Guan Shuqing hurriedly whispered in his ears.She was afraid that Wang Xian would get into conflict with the rest of the people whom she treated with care even before her family went bankrupt.\u201cI told you to look for me when you have any difficulties. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Wang Xian consoled her softly and looked at the rest.\u201cI don\u2019t seem to have any conflicts with anyone of you, right? Oh, if there is, it would only be with you,\u201d said Wang Xian, looking at Wu Chen.\u201cAre you having cold feet? We don\u2019t need conflicts. We just hate you.\u201dSitting in the middle of the room, Bi Xiuming looked at Wang Xian mockingly. \u201cTo be honest, thrashing people like you is not fun at all. But, you\u2019re too arrogant. Here, drink these two bottles of liquor up and get lost!\u201d\u201cLad, get out of this city. If I see you again, you\u2019ll bear the consequences,\u201d said Wu Chen while glaring at Wang Xian. He then turned to Guan Shuqing. \u201cYour father asked you to marry me, so don\u2019t try to be funny with me. If I find out you have other boyfriends, your father will teach you a lesson. Hmph!\u201d\u201cWhat a brag. Don\u2019t you even look at yourself in the mirror?\u201d said Su Mei\u2019er disdainfully to Wang Xian. Her eyes were beaming with joy from the misfortunes of others.\u201cYou guys can\u2019t do this!\u201d When Guan Shuqing looked at them, she was full of regret.

So stylish!\u201dWang Xian looked at them and drew his lips slowly. This situation seemed to have happened before.In particular, the two bottles of liquor in front of him.Wang Xian took out his phone and stood up slowly as he was calling Xue Jing.\u201cHey, Big Brother, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d At this moment, Xue Jing was in a kitchen not far away.He was asking the chefs to whip up some signature dishes for Wang Xian.\u201cSomeone asked me to find out about him. His name is Bi Xiuming,\u201d Wang Xian asked with a smile.\u201cBi Xiuming?\u201d Xue Jing paused slightly, \u201cHe should be from the Bi Family, one of the Ancient Martial Artist Families in the Rivertown. According to the ranking, they should be in sixth place, slightly weaker than us, but not too bad.\u201d\u201cOh, got it. I may break a few things. You\u2019ve got to come and settle it later.\u201dWang Xian hung up the phone after he finished his words.On the other side, Xue Jing froze before he screamed, \u201cGosh, Big brother is having a fight. Who the hell dares to provoke my Big Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, you\u2019re not that stupid since you know how to find out about me from someone else.\u201d Bi Xiuming was slightly taken aback when Wang Xian picked up his phone. When he overheard what he said, he chuckled.\u201cOkay, I got your information.\u201d Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face as he reached for a bottle of liquor.\u201cWell, so now you know who you\u2019re messing with?\u201d Wu Chen was showing a face full of sarcasm as Wang Xian picked up the bottle of liquor.\u201cXiao Xian!\u201d Guan Shuqing grabbed on Wang Xian\u2019s arm hastily.Wang Xian shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I haven\u2019t experienced this for very long. Last time, it was for my sister.\u201dA smile surfaced on Wang Xian\u2019s face. Two years ago, he was busy with his school work during the last year of high school. His younger sister was afraid that his studies might get affected, so she went to work in a pub to make some money.When he found out that someone bullied his sister, he ran over.The situation was similar to this. The other party wanted him to finish a box of wine before he could take his sister away. In the end\u2026He reached out his hand. In the past, it was for his sister. Today, it was for another girl.In the past, he had nothing except his enthusiasm and boldness. Now\u2026Everyone watched in horror when Wang Xian grabbed the bottle of liquor and slammed hard on Bi Xiuming.His strength was so mighty that no one could dodge the blow unless they were Level-seven Martial Artists.Not to mention, it was a sudden attack.Bi Xiuming, the young generation of Bi Family, was not any better than Xue Jing.Bam!Upon seeing the bottle coming at him, Bi Xiuming could only react out of his instinct by blocking it with his arm.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAh!\u201d Bi Xiuming let out a devastating scream as his arm was shaking from the sharp pain.\u201cWu Group, Gong Family, Song Family, Bi Xiuming?

In the past, as long as there was anyone who dared to bully his sister, he wouldn\u2019t care who the other party was. He would just fight it out!Throughout primary school, middle school and high school, he was more resolute and brave than most kids, as he was a kid without parents.He knew deeply that only by becoming stronger could he stop others from bullying him.Therefore, as long as there were people who bullied his sister during primary school, middle school or high school, he wouldn\u2019t care about the age of these people. He would just risk his life and fight them.Two fights in middle school deterred anyone from bullying his sister.Three fights in middle school stopped anyone in the high school from bullying his sister.And a fight outside the bar at that time made all the gangsters in the county wary of disturbing his sister.To those who dared to bully people he wanted to protect, Wang Xian would not waste his words on them. He never had much to say and would just fight it out.In the past, he relied on adrenaline and disregarding dangers to his life. As for now, he could rely on his personal strength. Moreover, Bi Xiuming, who had the strongest background in the room, was still weaker than Xue Family.Therefore, he could strike without being fearful of anything.Bam!\u201cHow dare you hit me? You are dead this time!\u201dBam!\u201cArgh\u2026 My leg is broken, my leg is broken\u2026 Don\u2019t hit me!\u201d\u201cArgh. You are crazy! Stop fighting! Stop fighting!\u201dBam!Wang Xian didn\u2019t say anything when he struck. He didn\u2019t like to speak while fighting as this would disrupt his flow of actions.Therefore, in less than 10 seconds, the other three young men were already lying on the floor of the room. They had food scattered all over them as they wailed in agony on the floor.This was still considering the fact that Wang Xian had controlled his strength. Otherwise, they would have been dead.\u201cHow dare you hit me! How dare you ambush me!\u201dBi Xiuming stared at Wang Xian and his body was shaking in anger. He had a hideous expression on him as he stood up and his eyes were bloodshot. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Wang Xian took a glance at Bi Xiuming and mocked, \u201cJust you? You are still too weak!\u201dAs he completed his sentence, he saw a bottle of white wine by his feet. He lowered his body and picked it up.\u201cDie!\u201d Seeing Wang Xian pick up the bottle of white wine, his eyes twitched violently as he jumped. He lifted his legs and kicked towards Wang Xian violently.Bam!However, the bottle of white wine was smashed ruthlessly on his right leg, making him shriek in pain.\u201cArgh! Bi Xiuming fell to the floor while wailing in agony.His right leg had been broken!Bam! Wang Xian heard his scream. He kicked impatiently at him and knocked him unconscious directly.\u201cWang Xian, how dare\u2026 How dare you hit them? You must be eager to die\u2026\u201d Su Mei\u2019er, who had been staying by the side, shrieked in horror.Wang Xian looked over coldly.\u201cXiao Xia, you\u2026 You\u2026 How could you start the fight. It\u2019s over Xiao Xian!\u201dGuan Shuqing saw Wang Xian strike without warning. Moreover, he even broke their arms and legs. Her heart started beating violently as worries filled her and her eyes turned red with tears.\u201cBig Brother! F*ck! Who the hell dares to offend my Big Brother.\u201dAt this moment, Xue Jing had arrived. Seeing the mess and the four young men lying on the floor, he turned to Wang Xian and asked, \u201cBig Brother, are you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Do I look like I\u2019m not?\u201d laughed Wang Xian.\u201cThat\u2019s true. Big Brother is so powerful,\u201d chuckled Xue Jing. He turned his attention to the four young men on the floor and a violent light flashed in his eyes. \u201cDamn it. How dare you offend Big Brother.\u201dAs he spoke, he walked straight into the room, pulled them by their clothes and threw them on the floor.\u201cSorry to trouble you,\u201d Wang Xian saw the mess in the room and said.\u201cBig Brother, not at all.\u201d Xue Jing quickly shook his head. He looked at the four young men on the floor and said, \u201cHe is from Bi Family and this must be Gong Liuyun from Gong Family. Damn it. They must be too eager to die. Big Brother, you are too lenient on them.As he finished his sentence, he kicked consecutively at the arms of the four men under the horrified eyes of Guan Shuqing and the other 3 girls.Crack crack crack crack!The sounds of bones breaking propagated over. Xue Jing didn\u2019t hold back at all and crippled the arms of the four young men.Argh!The intense pain jerked them awake as they held onto their arms in anguish.\u201cTsk. This is just a small lesson to you guys.\u201dXue Jing sneered. He had witnessed Wang Xian\u2019s strength. Because of his provocation, he almost died from a single kick of Wang Xian. Based on what his father had told him, if Wang Xian had not stepped in to help, he would have been crippled.Therefore when he saw that the injuries on the four young men weren\u2019t that serious, he piled on their injuries smartly to appease Big Brother Wang Xian.\u201cDirector Xue!\u201dAt this moment, seven to eight security personnel of the Summer Sun Resort had rushed over. When they saw Xue Jing, they quickly greeted him.\u201cCall for an ambulance and send them away!\u201d Xue Jing instructed coldly.\u201cYes, Director Xue.\u201d The security personnel nodded their heads.\u201cAnd the four of you, get out of here.\u201d Xue Jing looked at the girls and shouted.Su Mei\u2019er and the other two girls were stunned and looked at Xue Jing in horror.Guan Shuqing was also a little shocked as she shrank her body instinctively and hid behind Wang Xian in fear.\u201cThis is a friend of mine!\u201d Wang Xian patted on Guan Shuqing\u2019s shoulders and said to Xue Jing.Xue Jing\u2019s body shivered. When he saw Wang Xian\u2019s actions, he immediately said to Guan Shuqing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Sister-in-law. It\u2019s a misunderstanding.. a misunderstanding!\u201dGuan Shuqing was a little overwhelmed at this point.\u201cBig Brother, it would seem like you haven\u2019t gotten your lunch yet. Why don\u2019t I inform my grandfather and let\u2019s have lunch together?\u201d Xue Jing asked with a faint smile.Wang Xian hesitated for a while and looked to Guan Shuqing. \u201cHave you eaten? Wanna join us for lunch?\u201dGuan Shuqing nodded her head vaguely but quickly added, \u201cXiao Xian! Those guys that you beat up had very strong backgrounds. They\u2026\u201d\u201cRest assured. It will be fine.\u201d Wang Xian shook his head at Guan Shuqing and smiled. \u201cIf you encounter any difficulties in the future, just tell me. If anyone bullies you, I\u2019ll beat him up for you!\u201dGuan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian, gripped onto the edge of her clothes and replied, \u201cThank you, Xiao Xian.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Wang Xian stared at her and smiled. \u201cThat\u2026 Do you mean what you said last night?\u201d\u201cSee\u2026 See your performance!\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201d When Wang Xian saw Guan Shuqing\u2019s reaction, he had a resolve. He knew that he had fallen for this girl. When he saw her being treated unfairly and fought for her, he knew that the number of people he wished to protect had increased by one.\u201cBig Brother Wang Xian, please go to this private lounge. My grandfather and Old Qin would be there soon. Let\u2019s go and wait in the private lounge!\u201d Xue Jing said.\u201cAlright!\u201dWang Xian nodded his head and said to Guan Shuqing who was beside him, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We will be having lunch with some friends in a while.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMm!\u201d Guan Shuqing nodded her head and took another look at the four young men moaning in anguish.Just a while ago, Wu Chen had looked at her arrogantly and told her that she would be his wife in the future and that she had to listen to everything he said.The few other young men around Wu Chen were all looking at her and mocking her about her family\u2019s bankruptcy and that she shouldn\u2019t think too highly of herself.At this moment, they were all lying on the floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I can\u2019t hold my fists,\u201d Wang Xian said with a smile.\u201cThose affluent younger generations\u2026 It\u2019s good for you to teach them a lesson on behalf of their families,\u201d Old Xue said with no importance.\u201cYes, I didn\u2019t manage to hold back in time.\u201d Wang Xian chuckled.\u201cSo good to be young!\u201d Old Qin said with a little envy.\u201cHaha, come, take a seat.\u201d Old Xue laughed, \u201cWang Xian, aren\u2019t you going to introduce your confidante?\u201dWang Xian smiled and looked at Guan Shuqing, \u201cThis is my classmate, Guan Shuqing,\u201dThen he turned to Guan Shuqing and continued, \u201cThis is Old Qin and Old Xue!\u201d\u201cHello, Old Qin and Old Xue!\u201d Guan Shuqing hurriedly greeted them as she was slightly taken aback by surprise when she saw Wang Xian having conversations with two extraordinary elders.\u201cWell, well\u2026 she\u2019s quite pretty.\u201d Old Qin smiled.\u201cGuan Shuqing? Do you know Guan Shicheng?\u201d the middle-aged man who was carrying Little Kite asked suddenly.\u201cHe\u2019s my father. Do you know him?\u201d Guan Shuqing looked puzzled at the middle-aged man.\u201cI heard about him.\u201d The middle-aged man smiled.\u201cOh?\u201d Old Qin looked at his son with question marks on his face.\u201cDad, we\u2019ll talk about it after dinner!\u201d the middle-aged man smiled and said.\u201cAlright.\u201d Old Qin did not probe into it and continued his chat with Wang Xian and Old Xue.The lunch took over an hour. Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing left the place after making a promise to attend the dinner event that night.\u201cDad.\u201d Gazing at the back view of Guan Shuqing, the middle-aged man slightly frowned and continued, \u201cGuan Shuqing\u2019s father went bankrupt.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly is going on?\u201d asked Old Qin with his eyebrows slightly raised.\u201cGuan Shicheng was in the medical equipment business. This year, his vendor encountered some problems and landed him in hot soup. Eventually, he went bankrupt because of this. Her father came to me for help some time ago, but I turned him down,\u201d said the middle-aged man.\u201cOh, really?\u201d Old Qin pondered. \u201cInvite Guan Shicheng to the dinner tonight.\u201d\u201cYes, father.\u201d The middle-aged man nodded as he understood his father\u2019s intention.Guan Shicheng really has a good daughter.The middle-aged man pondered to himself.\u201cTonight, three of us are going to disturb Old Qin.\u201d Old Xue was wearing smiles on his face.He had a small family with only three of them practicing martial arts. During the early days, it was Xue Liangren who supported the family.Luckily, his son and his grandson did not disappoint him. They had great talents in martial arts. Hence, they could make a name in the Rivertown.A while ago, some of the people were ready for some trouble when he was injured. This time, he was going to announce the return of Xue Family along with his son and grandson. They were still the old Xue Family and could only be stronger than ever.\u201cWhere are we going? Should we stay here?\u201dAfter coming out of the room, Wang Xian looked and asked Guan Shuqing, who was next to him\u201cNo.\u201d Guan Shuqing shook her head and gazed at him.Wang Xian beamed and looked at Guan Shuqing. When they exchanged gazes, Guan Shuqing turned her head away.\u201cXiao Xian, will they be okay after you beat them up?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Didn\u2019t you meet Old Xue just now? It\u2019s his property here. Those Bi and Gong Family, and Wu\u2019s Group didn\u2019t even dare to provoke them. Besides, the one who broke the arm of that young man was Old Xue\u2019s grandson,\u201d Wang Xian said confidently. \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate me. I also know one or two formidable people. But, I\u2019m not afraid of them even if I\u2019m alone.\u201dGuan Shuqing was stunned as she looked blankly at Wang Xian. He had brought too much surprise to her such that she was getting mystified by him.But soon, Guan Shuqing smiled and said, \u201cYesterday\u2019s agreement is still valid.\u201dWang Xian drew his lips slightly and looked at Guan Shuqing, \u201cYou said it.\u201d\u201cUh-huh, I said it.\u201d\u201cHeh, then you will have to prepare yourself for it!\u201dWang Xian was on cloud nine as he fixed his gaze on the girl before him quietly.She was almost 1.7 meters tall, with long hair down to her shoulders. Her center parting hairstyle was only suitable for a Goddess like her.The simplistic and monochrome dressing made her look cool and fit her innocent and good figure.Sensing Wang Xian staring at her, Guan Shuqing chuckled and spun her body around, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the restaurant. I need to work so that I\u2019m not taking the salary for granted.\u201d\u201cSure, the boss will send you over.\u201dWang Xian laughed cheekily. They came to the entrance, and Wang Xian drove her back to the First-grade Restaurant.Guan Shuqing hugged Wang Xian at his waist as she sat on the backseat. With a smiling face, she sniffed the fragrance from his body and leaned gently on his back.\u201cBoss!\u201dManager Huang greeted them as soon as he saw Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing walking into the restaurant.Wang Xian nodded and returned to his office with Guan Shuqing.Manager Huang was sensible to walk out of the office.\u201cI will continue with my data.\u201d Guan Shuqing sat down and continued to analyze her data after finishing her sentence.Wang Xian nodded and returned to his seat. He fished out a ball of flesh that was about a thumb size from his pocket.It was the crystal-clear, red, glossy flesh, which had been growing in Little Kite\u2019s kidney.Glazed Inferno Crystal: Level SixExtractable Dragon Energy: 48,338Superpower: Glazed InfernoWang Xian toyed the Glazed Inferno Crystal in his palm as he was deep in his thoughts.The Glazed Inferno Crystal was growing in the Little Kite\u2019s body. Once the heat broke out in his body, it would burn him. As time went by, the blazing temperature would get higher and eventually burnt Little Kite to death.In order to suppress the Glazed Inferno, the Qin Family had been looking for Martial Artists to suppress it with their Internal Energy.However, Old Qin was unaware that, while Internal Energy might have suppressed the Glazed Inferno, it also provided nourishment to the fire and catalyzed its evolution.Hence, Old Qin looked for a Level-two Martial Artist to suppress it in the beginning. Subsequently, he noticed that the Internal Energy of Level-two Martial Artist was insufficient. Then he continued to Level three, four, five and six. Lastly, he found Old Xue, who was a Level-seven Martial Artist today.This Glazed Inferno Crystal was upgraded to Level Six through those Internal Energy from the Martial Artists.Once the Qin Family was unable to find a more advanced Martial Artist to suppress it. Little Kite would turn to ash immediately when the next relapse happened.Luckily, they met him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI can increase over 40,000 points of Dragon Energy, but it would be more practical if I can refine it into a Dragon Ball.\u201dWang Xian did not devour it immediately because he wanted to build a weapon.Basically, Divine Dragons did not have to use weapons, as their physical bodies were the most formidable weapon of all.However, there was a refining technique of Divine Dragon Weapons in the Divine Dragon Transformation for Dragon Ball.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Based on their elemental attributes, they would have different dragon balls.Dragon ball of fire attribute could burn the skies and cook the seas while the dragon ball of ice attribute could freeze the world.A strong dragon ball was sufficient to change an entire world.Wang Xian looked at the glazed inferno crystal in his hand. He dripped a drop of dragon blood on it before injecting dragon energy into the fire crystal. Soon, he felt a sense of control.Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. Through the upgrades used dragon blood and dragon energy, the glazed inferno crystal started to give off its own glow.The crimson red glow emitted a scorching hot temperature that could easily burn up a human.With just a change in his thoughts, the dragon ball levitated gradually in mid-air. All Wang Xian had to do was to instruct with his mind and the dragon ball would start moving rapidly.Great. Through the nourishment with dragon energy, this dragon energy will only get stronger and stronger in the future!Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised. Even at this very moment, the strength of this dragon ball was very horrifying.Its temperature could be 3000-4000 degrees.An ordinary man would be turned to ashes upon contact with the fire dragon ball! At this moment, even my body couldn\u2019t take it head on and a level seven martial artist couldn\u2019t touch it at all!Wang Xian thought to himself. With another change in thoughts, he kept the dragon ball in his body.\u201cGreat, great.\u201dExcitement filled Wang Xian\u2019s face. Seeing that Guan Shuqing was still reading the information, he switched on the computer and started playing.\u201cXiao Xian, I\u2019ll be heading home.\u201d At five-plus in the evening, Guan Shuqing spoke to Wang Xian who was facing the computer.\u201cAre you going back now? Do you need me to send you back?\u201d Wang Xian took down his earphones and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Guan Shuqing shook her head.\u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything,\u201d Wang Xian said to her.\u201cMm. Alright.\u201d Guan Shuqing smiled, nodded her head and headed out of the restaurant.\u201cIt\u2019s five-plus now. I should get going at 7 pm.\u201dWang Xian looked at the time. There would be a banquet hosted by Old Qin at Old Xue\u2019s five-star hotel tonight and he would be going over to take a look.When Guan Shuqing got home, her parents asked her to change into an evening gown and follow them to a banquet excitedly.Guan Shuqing was a little surprised by her parents\u2019 behavior.\u201cQuick. Qin Family will be hosting a banquet at Summer Sun International Hotel tonight and they have invited us!\u201d her father said agitatedly.Considering the state of her family at this moment, they were not qualified to attend a banquet hosted by the Qin Family. However, they had surprisingly received an invitation!If Guan Shuqing\u2019s father could get to know some friends in the banquet or get into the good books of Qin Family, it would be an easy task for him to make a comeback.Guan Shuqing was taken aback by what she heard from her father. Qin Family? Summer Sun International Hotel?This made her recall her lunch with Old Qin and Old Xue at Summer Sun Resort in the afternoon.However, she did not read too much into it and couldn\u2019t believe that would be true. She changed into the clothes and headed to Summer Sun International Hotel with her parents in advance.Summer Sun International Hotel was a property under the Xue Family of Rivertown. When one spoke of the Xue Family, the upper social circle often referred to them as Ancient Martial Arts Family, Xue Family.They were ranked fifth in the ranking of Ancient Martial Artist Families in Rivertown. However, they would probably advance up the ranking by one or two as the Old Master of Xue Family had recently achieved a breakthrough.As for Qin Family, they were the commerce superpower in Rivertown. Qin Family\u2019s Ancient Dynasty Property, Ancient Dynasty Logistics and Ancient Dynasty Real Estate, were all humongous organizations.The assets of Qin Family were over $10 billion. Moreover, the background of Qin Family was very, very strong.Currently, the Old Master of Qin Family had a war comrade holding an important position in the government. The brother of Old Qin\u2019s wife was a very capable person in the capital of the province. Despite not being an Ancient Martial Arts Family, Qin Family was still one of the strongest in existence within Rivertown.Even Ancient Martial Arts Families wouldn\u2019t dare to offend them.For the banquet hosted by Qin Family tonight, 60% of the elites of Rivertown would be present.At 7.30 pm, a heavy-duty motorcycle arrived at Summer Sun International Hotel. There was a row of luxury cars lined up neatly in front of the entrance of the hotel.Wang Xian removed his helmet and smiled as he looked at the luxurious hotel in front of him.\u201cHmm\u2026 It seems that I have underestimated the Xue Family. This construction costs of this hotel would at least be several hundreds of millions.\u201dWang Xian looked around before walking in.The seventh story was where the Qin Family would be hosting the banquet and they had already booked the entire seventh story.Wang Xian walked out from the lift and headed to the main hall joyously.\u201cMister, please show us your invitation.\u201d When he arrived at the entrance, the two employees were looking at him with weird looks.\u201cInvitation letter?\u201d Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and replied, \u201cQin Lianhui said it would be fine as long as I said I\u2019m with him. You could give him a call to check.\u201d\u201cQin Lianhui?\u201dDirector Qin!The two employees were shocked. One of them took out a phone to verify after taking another look at Wang Xian.\u201cMister Wang, this way please.\u201d After hanging up the phone, the employee spoke enthusiastically.Wang Xian nodded his head and headed in.\u201cThis is Qin Family\u2019s banquet. Isn\u2019t this young man too casual with his dressing?\u201d\u201cIf he could call our Director Qin by his name, his background must not be ordinary.\u201dThe two employees conversed softy as they saw Wang Xian off.Dressing?With Wang Xian\u2019s acute hearing, he could hear the conversation between the two of them clearly. He was shocked and quickly took a look at his attire.He was wearing casual attire from Versace and a pair of white casual shoes. I do look pretty handsome!Hmm? Perhaps my attire isn\u2019t really suitable for the occasion!At this moment, Wang Xian saw the group of people in the banquet hall who had arrived. The guys were all in suits and the girls were in evening gowns.Looking across, he understood the level of this banquet immediately.Most of the men had watches on their wrists. As for the ladies, they had all kinds of necklaces around their necks.Damn it. This is my first time attending a banquet like this. I didn\u2019t know about these!Wang Xian truly didn\u2019t know. He hadn\u2019t given much thought about the banquet in the afternoon and headed over directly in his casual attire.My attire currently isn\u2019t really fitting for the occasion here!Forget it. Since this was organized by Old Qin, he will know that I\u2019m not being disrespectful to him.Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. He walked inside in a straight line.He hadn\u2019t had his dinner yet. Therefore, he chose to head to a corner to get some food.Eh? Isn\u2019t that Shuqng? When Wang Xian arrived at the corner, he was surprised to see a familiar figure.Guan Shuqing was sitting with a middle-aged man and a couple and they were most probably her parents.Guan Shuqing was wearing a black evening gown tonight. She also had high heels on and exquisite makeup put up, making her look extremely alluring.Wang Xian walked over with smiles. \u201cShuqing, what a coincidence! You are here too!\u201dGuan Shuqing was slightly shocked when she saw Wang Xian after lifting her head. She was also surprised and asked, \u201cXiao Xiao, why are you here too?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGuan Shuqing stood up.Her parents, who were beside her, turned their heads around with doubts. They took a look at Wang Xian before looking at their daughter again. Immediately, they frowned.\u201cDaughter, who is he?\u201d Her father frowned and asked.To be dressed so casually in a formal setting, the first impression he had of Wang Xian was that this young man wasn\u2019t sensible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, they could be his future parents-in-law.\u201cHur?\u201d Guan Shuqing\u2019s father frowned. He acknowledged, and threw him a glance before he fixed his eyes on his daughter.\u201cDad, this is\u2026this is my classmate.\u201d Guan Shuqing hesitated.\u201cClassmate.\u201d Her father looked at Guan Shuqing and nodded.Wang Xian was a little stunned, as he could sense that his future father-in-law did not seem to like him. Helplessly, he looked at Guan Shuqing. \u201cI\u2019ll sit over here.\u201dAs he said, he took a seat at the sofa next to Guan Shuqing.\u201cDad, Mom, I\u2019ll chat with my classmate for a while,\u201d said Guan Shuqing to her parents as she nodded to Wang Xian.\u201cSit with us. We\u2019re bringing you to meet some people later on,\u201d said Guan Shuqing\u2019s father, frowning.Guan Shuqing knit her brow, sat down with them helplessly, and smiled to Wang Xian with bitterness.Wang Xian shook his head slightly and gave her a smile.\u201cShuqing, what kind of family does your classmate come from?\u201d Guan Shuqing\u2019s mother looked at Wang Xian with doubts and asked her.\u201cThis classmate of mine,\u201d Guan Shuqing threw a glance at Wang Xian and answered with some pride, \u201cis really awesome, Mom. He\u2019s the same age as me, but he already earns millions of dollars. Isn\u2019t he superb?\u201d\u201cOh? Is that so? He\u2019s making millions at such a young age?\u201d her mother said in surprise.Guan Shuqing\u2019s father was stunned too. He looked at his daughter and asked, \u201cWhat kind of business is he doing?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026!\u201d Guan Shuqing chuckled, \u201cDad, Mom, let me tell you this. That\u2019s the best part of him. He only has a younger sister, but he relied on himself and became an entrepreneur. Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s awesome?\u201d\u201cNo background?\u201d Her father paused for a moment and frowned again.\u201cNope, he relies on his own effort when he is just as young as me.\u201d Guan Shuqing laughed while saying it.Her father shook his head slightly, \u201cNo wonder he entered this place in casual wear. I guess he followed someone here, but that person did not bring him to network with the rest of the people.\u201dHer father was disappointed. A young man who could earn millions was awesome indeed. But without any backings or background, his achievements would be limited.When he saw Wang Xian picking some food and beginning to eat alone, all the more he shook his head.Upon seeing the expression on her father\u2019s face, Guan Shuqing was unsure why.\u201cDirector Wu is here. Let\u2019s go, Shuqing.\u201dHer father took a glance at the hall and saw a familiar figure. He quickly got up and told them.Guan Shuqing followed behind reluctantly.\u201cMy future father-in-law seems to have a problem with me!\u201d When Wang Xian realized that Guan Shuqing\u2019s parents did not even look at himself, he picked up some fruit and started to feast on it. Then he fished out his phone and dialed for Xue Jing, asking her when she would be here as he was too bored.Piak!Suddenly, a loud slap was heard abruptly in the ballroom.Everyone was shocked, including Wang Xian.Wang Xian was toying with his phone when he turned around. Soon after, he stood up with a darkened expression.At the center of the ballroom, Guan Shuqing was covering her face with her head down while her father was standing there with a hideous look on his face.Next to them, a few middle-aged men stood there and watched impassively.His father walked over with a sullen face.\u201cDirector Wu, Director Gong, Master Bi, Director Song, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t expect she would do such a thing. It was my lack of discipline. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWang Xian came to the middle of the ballroom as he watched Guan Shicheng bowing down and apologizing in fear.\u201cDo you think you can settle this with a slap? My son is lying in the hospital with broken limbs now!\u201d Chairman Wu glared at Guan Shicheng coldly.When he knew his son was sent to the hospital in the afternoon, he was shocked. He scrambled his way to the hospital where the doctor told him that the right arm and leg of his son were broken. It would take three to four months to recover.He raged when his son was immobilized. He learned from his son that everything happened because of Guan Shuqing and the boyfriend of hers.This made his blood boil. He immediately sent people to investigate the specific details and the culprit who beat his son up.Yet, Guan Shicheng had the cheek to greet him just now. If this was not the event of the Qin Family, he might just make his move.The rest of the three middle-aged men were having the same sentiments as they stared coldly at Guan Shicheng.Guan Shicheng was fearful as he did not expect his daughter would have created such trouble. He trembled in his shoes.\u201cShuqing!\u201dWang Xian walked over and called her name gently. As soon as he saw Guan Shuqing was holding her face, he stretched out his hand slowly and caressed her cheek.\u201cXiao Xian!\u201d A teardrop fell on his hand. Guan Shuqing lifted her chin with tears rolling in her eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m here.\u201dWang Xian stroked her face as his heart ached for her. He used the Dragon Energy to moisturize her cheek.\u201cWho are you? Get out of my way!\u201d Guan Shicheng looked at Wang Xian first before he stared at Guan Shuqing with a trembling body. \u201cI raised you up. It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not doing me a favor. Yet, you got into such trouble. I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t have such a daughter like you\u2026\u201dWang Xian looked at Guan Shicheng and frowned. He then turned and gazed at the four middle-aged men. With a cold smile, he said, \u201cI was the one who beat up all your sons.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Before the four middle-aged men could say anything, Guan Shicheng fixed his gaze deadly on Wang Xian. \u201cYou were the one who beat up their sons?\u201d\u201cYes, Uncle. It was me, and it had nothing to do with Shuqing.\u201d Wang Xian looked at Guan Shicheng and nodded.\u201cGreat, so it was you! You scoundrel, how dare you hit their sons?

What do you guys want?\u201d\u201cHow arrogant of you to admit to beating them. Hehe, what do you think your outcome will be after beating Master Bi San\u2019s son?\u201dA young man stood out and ridiculed Wang Xian upon hearing Wang Xian\u2019s reply.\u201cHow? That\u2019s a good question.

He must be really eager to die.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. To wear casual attire to attend a banquet, his upbringing must be really bad!\u201d\u201cHe truly deserves death. Even if the people of the four families were to cripple him, it wouldn\u2019t be considered overboard. If this lad were to even touch my son, I\u2019d kill him no matter what!\u201dThe crowd started dissing and criticizing Wang Xian\u201cHow could he wear such attire to attend this banquet.

Following which, a beautiful lady walked over.She was in a red dress and had light makeup on her. Overall, she gave off a distant feel to others.Her entrance attracted the attention of many people instantly. Many young men looked towards this figure fervently.The eyes of the young man standing beside Master Bi San lit up as he clenched his fist tightly.\u201cThe eldest daughter of the Lan Family, Lan Qingyue.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s the future successor of the Lan Family, Lan Qingyue. The one beside her is the General Manager of the Lan Family, Lan Gongwen. He is also Lan Qingyue\u2019s uncle.\u201d\u201cThe future successor of Deep-sea Jewelry, Lan Qingyue. They are the strongest listed company in Rivertown and could be considered as the leaders in the jewelry industry in the country.\u201dSome people saw Lan Qingyue and exclaimed softly.\u201cHi, uncles, my friend is at fault for this incident. I would like to ask for forgiveness on his behalf.\u201d Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian and the cold look in her eyes flickered for a moment. She walked to the side of him and looked towards Master Bi San and the group.\u201cWhat? Why would Lan Qingyue try to protect this kid?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Could it be that this lad has a good relationship with the Lan Family?\u201dThe surrounding crowd was surprised. Some people were even looking at Lan Qingyue with shock.Wang Xian was also looking at Lan Qingyue with bewilderment. He had not expected to see her at this place and had not expected her to help him.Lan Qingyue turned her head over, smiled at Wang Xian and commented, \u201cWhat a coincidence!\u201dThis smile was just as beautiful as a hundred flowers blooming at the same time. The cold-looking Lan Qingyue had an indescribable charm.\u201cThank you!\u201d Wang Xian expressed his gratitude to Lan Qingyue. Recalling that he had rejected her invitation for a meal twice, he suddenly felt a little embarrassed.Lan Qingyue smiled and nodded her head. She turned her attention towards Director Wu, Director Gong, Director Song, and Master Bi San. \u201cDear uncles, please look past this incident for my sake.\u201dMiss Lan. When Director Wu, Director Gong and the group saw Lan Qingyue, their expressions changed.Deep-sea Jewelry was a large corporation with a market capitalization of close to $10 billion. This was more than ten times greater than theirs.Even if the four families added their assets together, they still wouldn\u2019t be a match for Deep-sea Jewelry.The only one who wasn\u2019t wary was Master Bi San. This was because Bi Family was an Ancient Martial Artist Family and couldn\u2019t be measured directly using typical cash value and background.However, Master Bi San still wasn\u2019t very pleased. After all, a family that was worth $10 billion would have a complicated and widely connected background. When one\u2019s money reached an outrageous amount, it could also be seen as one\u2019s strength.\u201cMiss Lan, this friend of yours crippled the arms and legs of my son. Aren\u2019t you being unreasonable to ask me to let this go!\u201d Master Bi San stared at Lan Qingyue but his eyes were flickering.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Miss Lan. My son was crippled because of him. If I just let this go, how would anyone show us respect in the future?\u201d Director Wu added with a solemn face.\u201cUncles, I, Lan Qingyue, am willing to compensate for the injuries of your beloved sons. Please don\u2019t pursue this matter anymore for my sake,\u201d Lan Qingyue said with a determined look.Lan Qingyue\u2019s words caused the atmosphere of the surroundings to solidify.No one would have expected that the eldest daughter of Lan Family would try to protect this wild lad and disregard the fact that she would be going up against four families.This caused a lot of young men in the crowd to be filled with jealousy. This lad doesn\u2019t deserve this at all!Guan Shicheng\u2019s expression also changed as he looked on with disbelief.Director Wu, Director Gong, Director Song and Master Bi San had a ghastly look. They had not expected that the eldest daughter of the Lan Family would be so insistent on this matter, disregarding the chances of offending them in order to protect this young man. This caused them to be very embarrassed by the situation.\u201cWhat? What\u2019s the matter?\u201dHowever at this moment, a frivolous voice sounded. A middle-aged man walked over from the inner area of the banquet hall and looked inquisitively towards the center.Everyone was surprised and turned their attention to their back. All of them saw a middle-aged man carrying an apple in hand, eating it while walking.\u201cSecond Master Qin!\u201d\u201cSecond Master Qin!\u201dSome people in the crowd immediately gave their greetings to this middle-aged man.Second Master Qin was looking a little pale and had serious eye bags. He also looked like a frivolous guy who liked to fool around.When the crowd saw his behavior, they didn\u2019t look down on him. Instead, they were addressing him as \u201cSecond Master Qin\u201d with the utmost respect.This was because he was the second son of Old Qin, or an adopted son.Old Qin had a total of two sons. The second son was adopted and was the son of a war comrade of Old Qin. After his war comrade had passed away, he asked Old Qin to take care of his son. Old Qin took him in and adopted him as his son immediately. However, this adopted son was arrogant and cocky from a young age and got into a lot of trouble in Rivertown. He even caused the death of some people. Despite nearing his forties, he still wasn\u2019t married and didn\u2019t have a child. Rumors had it that he had a strange fetish and Old Qin wasn\u2019t too fond of him.Despite all that, Old Qin valued relationships and had been turning a blind eye to the actions of this adopted son.Although he was an adopted son, he was still the second master in the Qin Family. No matter how useless he might be, he was still high above the rest as his identity was known to everyone.\u201cSecond Master.\u201d Master Bi San immediately called out Second Master Qin when he saw him. Bi Family was inferior to Xue Family and was even further behind Qin Family. When Master Bi San saw Second Master Qin, he still had to greet him politely.Moreover, Master Bi San had always had a good relationship with Second Master Qin.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Master Bi San?\u201d Second Master Qin asked Master Bi San before biting his apple.\u201cSecond Master, please be the judge for us in this matter.\u201d Master Bi San explained the whole situation to Second Master Qin. In the end, he whispered something to Second Master Qin.\u201cWhat! Such a thing has happened?\u201d Second Master Qin looked ahead and his vision fell onto Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue.\u00a0\u201cOh niece Qingyue, it\u2019s better if you stay out of this. This lad deserved the punishment for breaking the arms and legs of others.\u201d [1]Waa!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUpon hearing Second Master Qin\u2019s words, the crowd erupted.\u201cSince Second Master Qin has spoken, it would be pointless even if Lan Qingyue put in a good word for him. This lad is as good as dead.\u201dEndnote:[1] \u201cNiece\u201d in this context isn\u2019t the same as the child of one\u2019s sibling. In Chinese culture, one would call the child of a business partner (or people with close relationships) \u201cniece\u201d or \u201cnephew.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When everyone thought that Lan Qingyue could shield this lad, Second Master Qin put it to a stop.Second Master Qin was the godson of Old Qin. Even though he was not the favorite son, his status was high enough to suppress Lan Qingyue, who had yet to inherit the Deep-sea Jewelry.True enough, Lan Qingyue frowned slightly when she heard what Second Master Qin said.Second Master Qin observed Wang Xian from head to toe. He then ditched the apple core in his hand into the trash.\u201cLad, what an insensible lad to come to our function in casual wear. Who taught you to be ill-mannered?\u201d\u201cSecond Master Qin, he is my friend. I hope you\u2019ll let him off on my account,\u201d said Lan Qingyue to Second Master Qin with a frowning look.\u201cQingyue, we have to be reasonable. This fellow should bear the consequences since he broke the limbs of others. You better not involve yourself.\u201d Second Master Qin smiled at Lan Qingyue.\u201cQingyue.\u201d The middle-aged man who has been following beside Lan Qingyue tugged her arm and shook his head. \u201cSince Second Master Qin is involved, you better leave this matter alone. You won\u2019t have any control over this.\u201d\u201cNo way, Uncle. He is my friend!\u201d Lan Qingyue gritted her teethand looked at her uncle with determination.The middle-aged man shook his head again. \u201cQingyue, don\u2019t be reckless. You have to spare a thought for the Lan Family too. Without Second Master Qin\u2019s involvement, we can help. But\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man shook his head. He could not understand why his niece insisted on helping this young man. If Second Master Qin was not involved, it did not matter at all since Lan Family was capable of dealing with this.But the Qin Family was the most influential family in the Rivertown.Lan Qingyue had a drastic change in her expression. She looked at Wang Xian worriedly.\u201cThis has got nothing to do with him. It was all because of me!\u201d Guan Shuqing shuddered as she stepped forward and spoke with determination in her eyes.\u201cNonsense, all this happened because of that lad and has got nothing to do with the Guan Family. Guan Shuqing, I don\u2019t have such a daughter like you.\u201d Guan Shicheng was trembling with anger as he bawled.\u201cIt was I who beat them up. What has it got to do with you?\u201d Wang Xian felt comforted when Lan Qingyue lent him a helping hand, and when Guan Shuqing stood in his defense.He slowly walked to the middle of the ballroom and swept his gazes across Second Master Qin, Master Bi San and the rest of the people. With a cold voice, he said again, \u201cI did what I did. If things like this happen again, it won\u2019t be as simple as this time.\u201d\u201cArrogant lad. After you walk out of this door today, I\u2019ll make sure you live in despair forever.\u201d Master Bi San growled at Wang Xian with a darkened expression.\u201cYou\u2019re arrogant, heh, simply too arrogant!\u201d When Second Master Qin saw Wang Xian\u2019s attitude, he sneered at him.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we settle this matter now?\u201d A cold smile surfaced on Wang Xian\u2019s face as he walked slowly to Master Bi San.\u201cWang Xian.\u201d Lan Qingyue, who was next to him, quickly called him when she saw Wang Xian walking over.There was no response from Wang Xian as he continued making his way to Master Bi San.\u201cHow dare you create trouble in the Qin Family\u2019s banquet!\u201d Second Master Qin\u2019s expression turned cold when he saw the menacing Wang Xian walking over.\u201cHow dare you play punk in Qin Family\u2019s banquet! Lad, you\u2019re courting your own death!\u201d Master Bi San glared coldly at Wang Xian.\u201cHe is seeking his own death to act arrogantly in the Qin Family\u2019s dinner function.\u201d\u201cLad, even if we don\u2019t kill you, Qin Family will not let you off either.\u201dDirector Wu, Director Song, Director Gong, and the rest of the guests spoke in a low voice while looking at Wang Xian.\u201cReckless lad, seeking his own death.\u201d The middle-aged man standing beside Lan Qingyue shook his head slowly.\u201cAll of you are too noisy. I\u2019ll destroy you today.\u201d Wang Xian raged. His anger was not only targeting at Master Bi San and the other three people. It was also because of the father of Guan Shuqing and the Qin Family.Old Qin invited me over, and look what his second son is doing to me? What does he take me, Wang Xian, for? Is this the way the Qin Family treats their guest?A ferocious look flashed in Wang Xian\u2019s eyes as he stared at Master Bi San. The Dragon Energy exploded from his body, enveloping Master Bi San and Second Master Qin.Both of them had a drastic change in their expression as they sensed the immense oppression of the young man.\u201cLad, if you dare to fight in Qin\u2019s place, I\u2019ll make sure you die a horrible death,\u201d said Second Master Qin harshly as he stared at Wang Xian with cold eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re asking for your death if you strike. I\u2019ll teach you a lesson so that you\u2019ll learn some rules today.\u201dThe young man before Master Bi San brightened up his eyes when he observed the situation. In a swift movement, he swung his fist at Wang Xian.\u201cGu Qinglong struck. Gu Family is an Ancient Martial Artist Family that came from other cities. They did not have many members in the family, and their skills were not that formidable, but still, they could not be underestimated.\u201d\u201cThis young lad is simply courting his own death. How dare he strike in the banquet of Qin Family. This is as good as slapping them in their faces. He\u2019s finished.\u201d\u201cJust now, Master Bi San and the rest of them did not dare to strike in the midst of the banquet. This lad is just too arrogant. He is seeking a quick way to die.\u201dThe rest of the guests watched Wang Xian as though they were looking at an idiot.\u201cYou talk too much.\u201d Impassively, Wang Xian looked at the young man who struck at him.He swung out his fist straight at him.\u201cHow dare an ordinary guy take my fist. Go to hell!\u201d Gu Qinglong displayed a disdainful look. He wanted to prove himself. That was the reason why he was so eager to strike today.He wanted to announce the arrival of Gu Family in the Rivertown and befriend the Bi Family, another Ancient Martial Artist Family. In this case, he could quickly build up his foundation.Ka Ka Ka!His thinking was good. But a bone-cracking sound was heard when the fists collided with each other.Gu Qinglong\u2019s arm was broken under the formidable power.\u201cUseless thing!\u201d Wang Xian did not even display 20% of his power. He jeered at Gu Qinglong, who was screaming in pain on the floor.\u201cAh!\u201dGu Qinglong was crying out in agony as he looked frightened.\u201cAh!\u201dThe rest of the guests let out a gasp and a cry as they saw Gu Qinglong\u2019s deformed arm.Wang Xian looked at Master Bi San, and a cold smile surfaced, \u201cNo hurry. We don\u2019t have to wait until we leave. We can settle this one by one now.\u201dAs he was talking, he made his move and launched his attack on Master Bi San.\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it. I will kill you today!\u201d Master Bi San clenched his fist with veins popping out.Master Bi San was a Martial Artist with Level Five strength. He was shocked to see that the young man before him was also a Martial Artist. But he had no fear of him.\u201cNo wonder you\u2019re arrogant. But you\u2019re too full of yourself. Go to hell!\u201dWith a hideous look, Master Bi San moved like a fearsome tiger as five of his fingers turned into claws.\u201cSending me to hell? You are not fit to do it yet.\u201d Wang Xian looked at Master Bi San scornfully. He lifted his foot and swept it across.\u201cDie.\u201d Master Bi San stretched his claws at Wang Xian\u2019s leg.Ka! Bam!Master Bi San felt like he was scratching on a metal surface the moment they collided. Immediately, a mighty force hit his shoulder.Bam!The mighty force sent Master Bi San crashing to the table next to him at a much faster speed. He then landed on the ground and spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d The moment Master Bi San was knocked down within a split second, Second Master Qin was a little terrified when he saw Wang Xian\u2019s emotionless look in his eyes. He tried to act tough as he yelled, \u201cStop it. Otherwise\u2026 otherwise, the Qin Family will not let you off. No one dares to provoke us in the Rivertown.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t let me off?\u00a0You might want to ask if Qin Guohui dares to say this to me!\u201d Wang Xian let out a low growl with an impassive expression.The rest of the people were shocked to hear this!Qin Guohui, Old Qin!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You might want to ask if Qin Guohui dares to say this to me!\u201dHowever, just as they arrived at the entrance, all of them heard this angry roar.Old Qin was completely stunned and Old Xue immediately frowned.\u201cGrandfather, that\u2019s Brother Wang Xian\u2019s voice,\u201d Xue Jing commented quickly upon hearing as his expression turned solemn.Old Qin clearly heard Wang Xian\u2019s voice too. His expression changed quickly and a worried look hung on his face. \u201cLet\u2019s quickly get there and take a look!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t understand why Wang Xian would let out such an angry roar.He couldn\u2019t understand why the seemingly amiable Wang Xian, who he had an enjoyable lunch with in the afternoon, would be so angry.Disregarding the fact that Old Xue believed that he had unparalleled horrifying strength, Wang Xian had just cured his beloved grandson. Their Qin Family couldn\u2019t make him an enemy.Moreover, even the Qin Family wouldn\u2019t go offend such a strong expert for no reason.In the modern era, other than the society, there was also an underworld. Although the Qin Family was very strong in society, they still wouldn\u2019t dare to offend strong experts of the underworld.Old Xue frowned and quickly hurried in.At this moment, the crowd was completely astounded by Wang Xian\u2019s words.Everyone was shocked as no one expected him to shout that Qin Guohui wouldn\u2019t dare to say this to him in the Qin Family\u2019s banquet.\u201cStep aside. All of you, step aside!\u201d At this moment, Xue Jing\u2019s growl sounded from behind the crowd.Everyone who was gathered here was shaken as they quickly looked back.\u201cOld Qin is here and Old Xue is here too!\u201dA middle-aged man couldn\u2019t contain his shock and exclaimed.The crowd opened up a path of them automatically.\u201cThis lad is finished.\u201d\u201cHis death is certain!\u201dA weak voice sounded from the side. When Lan Qingyue saw Old Qin and Old Xue, she couldn\u2019t help but feel deeply worried.As for Guan Shuqing, she was dumbfounded when she looked over. Following which, joy and relief replaced her initial emotions and were shown on her face.They really are! They really are\u2026!She was shaken up. The two people who were walking at the front of the group were the two old men she\u2019d had lunch with in the afternoon.When she arrived, she was still a little suspicious. However, she didn\u2019t dare to think so and assumed that they were these two old men. At this moment, all her worries had dissipated entirely.She recalled the attitude of the two old men when speaking with Wang Xian in the afternoon. She was more confident that Wang Xian truly had the qualification to say what he had just said previously.\u201cYou\u2019re finished! How dare you start a fight and injure others in a banquet hosted by the Qin Family. You\u2019re finished! My dad is here.\u201d Second Master Qin was exhilarated upon seeing Old Qin walking over.Wang Xian\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change a bit and was still emitting the aura of the divine dragon. He turned his head around and looked towards Old Qin\u2019s Family and the three people from Xue Family.What a strong disposition!Old Xue could sense the faint aura around Wang Xian and was shocked. He thought that his strength was probably similar to Wang Xian after making the breakthrough. However, he felt that he still wasn\u2019t a match for Wang Xian after feeling this disposition.The Qin Family and Xue Family walked over in a straight line.The surrounding atmosphere had frozen up and no one even dared to take a deep breath.When Old Qin heard what his adopted son said, his hand, which was holding onto the walking stick, started trembling. He walked directly towards Second Master Qin without any expressions.\u201cFather, he actually dares to \u2026 in the banquet organized by us\u2026 Argh!\u201d When Second Master Qin saw his father walking over, he reported happily.However, before he could even complete his sentence, the walking stick in Old Qin\u2019s hand had landed ruthlessly on his leg.Crack crack!The walking stick made of solid wood broke directly! One could easily imagine how furious Old Qin was.\u201cFather, you\u2026 Why did you beat me\u2026\u201d Second Master Qin\u2019s face turned pale as he grabbed onto his leg and spoke in horror.Haiz! Old Qin suddenly heaved a sigh. \u201cWhen your father passed away and handed you over for me to take care of, I saw you as my biological son. However, you have repeatedly\u2026I have always turned a blind eye to your actions but you didn\u2019t learn your lessons and committed so many heinous acts under the name of our family.

It\u2019s because of my loose teachings that you had to suffer!\u201d\u201cBrother, don\u2019t be angry. Hug, hug!\u201d Little Kite looked at the solemn-faced Wang Xian and said as he walked in front of him and raised his arms.After witnessing the attitude of Old Qin and the cute Little Kite, a smile appeared on Wang Xian\u2019ss face. He reached out his arm and carried Little Kite. \u201cOld Qin, it was I who was impulsive. Sorry for causing you troubles.\u201dOld Qin heaved a huge sigh of relief upon seeing Wang Xian\u2019s expression. He smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s great, that\u2019s great\u2026 As long as Brother Wang Xian doesn\u2019t blame it on this old man.\u201dWang Xian smiled and replied, \u201cI was impulsive.

I\u2019ll definitely give you a good explanation for what happened today.\u201dWang Xian smiled.\u201cGrandfather, I have found out about the incident.\u201d Xue Jing returned immediately after going over to a service attendant to find out more. Subsequently, he repeated the whole event softly.\u201cHmm? It seems like it\u2019s still about the incident in the afternoon. Bi Famly?\u201d A murderous intent flashed passed Old Xue\u2019s face. \u201cIn that case, I shall use Bi Family to establish our dominance. As for the rest, I\u2019ll leave them to Qin Family to settle.\u201d\u201cYes, father!\u201d Xue Jiahua nodded his head and looked to Qin Lianhui.Qin Lianhui nodded his head and headed directly to Director Wu, Director Gong and Director Song.As for Xue Jiahua, he walked over to Master Bi San who had crawled up.\u201cFather, no. This can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Second Master Qin was mumbling to himself in a daze. He couldn\u2019t believe that what had happened was the reality. If he left Qin Family, who would he be in Rivertown in the future?And at this moment, the crowd in the banquet hall had their attention focused on the young man who was carrying Old Qin\u2019s beloved grandson.

Serves your son right for offending the benefactor of Xue Family!\u201dIn the ballroom, Xue Jiahua walked towards Master Bi San and stared coldly at him.Master Bi San was trembling as he looked at the young man between Old Xue and Old Qin. A bitter smile surfaced on his face as he looked embarrassingly at Xue Jiahua.From the exchange just now, he knew that he had provoked the wrong people. The strength that the young man had exploded just now was definitely coming from someone whom the Bi Family could not afford to offend.\u201cBut, you are equally wicked.\u201dAfter Xue Jiahua threw out his cold and harsh remark, he punched out at Master Bi San\u2019s shoulder immediately.Upon seeing the attack from Xue Jiahua, Master Bi San wore a different expression. But he did not dare to resist.Old Xue from the Xue Family was thought to be a dying person. Yet, he had suddenly recovered and made a breakthrough in his level. This reshuffled the rankings of the Ancient Martial Artist Families in Rivertown.The Xue Family was already more formidable than the Bi Family. Now, they had become people whom they could not afford to provoke.Kaka!A bone-cracking sound was heard from the ballroom. Everyone was horrified to see Master Bi San lying on the floor as he hugged his arm in extreme agony.\u201cYour broken arm shall serve you a lesson. If you have any grievances, the Xue Family will answer all of them,\u201d said Xue Jiahua coldly to Master Bi San.Everyone was shocked to watch the fearsome Xue Jiahua.\u201cDirector Gong, Director Song, Director Wu.\u201dOn the other side, Qin Lianhui came to them and looked at those millionaire directors.\u201cDirector Qin\u2026\u201dThey quickly addressed him. At this time, cold sweat was breaking on their foreheads with eyes full of horror.\u201cMr. Wang is a guest of the Qin Family,\u201d Qin Lianhui said emotionlessly. \u201cWe were also there in the afternoon when it happened. We were planning to give you a warning tonight.\u201dQin Lianhui was speaking impassively as though he was talking about a trivial matter.Yet, the directors could not help but to shake in their boots as they knew that it was the end of the story for them.\u201cDirector Qin, we were wrong. I really didn\u2019t know. If I had known, I would have killed that unfilial son of mine\u2026\u201d Director Wu almost went jelly as he bowed with his shaken body.\u201cLeave Rivertown now and don\u2019t let me see you again.\u201d Qin Lianhui gestured, annoyed, at them.Their faces turned black when they heard what Qin Lianhui said. Yet, they were in such despair that they had nothing to say.Asking them to leave Rivertown was equivalent to asking them to give up their foundation over here.But, they were powerless to put up any resistance because this was the decision made by the Qin Family.\u201cIt was all my son\u2019s fault for offending someone that he shouldn\u2019t.\u201dThe three directors clenched their fists and walked out like zombies.There was no place in the entire Rivertown for them.Master Bi San also left with his face full of despair.Anything that took place in the society would have to be resolved within the society. So were the underworld matters.Even though Bi Family was not asked to leave their base in Rivertown, the Xue Family would forever be pressing on them. Bi Family would not be able to obtain some resources in the future.\u201cThrow him out.\u201d As Xue Jing spoke to one of the hotel staff, he stepped on both legs of Gu Qinglong at the side with force.The surrounding crowd could not help but shiver when they saw the happenings unfolding.They were glad that they did not intervene or jeer at that young man.But those who spoke ill of that young man were standing there with their hearts in their mouths.Second Master Qin, the adopted son of Old Qin, had been expelled from the Qin Family.Master Bi San of the Bi Family had gotten his arm broken by Xue Jiahua.Gong, Song, and Wu Family would no longer have their foothold in Rivertown.Gu Qinglong of the Gu Family who had help Master Bi San would only have a tough life in Rivertown.All these were results of offending the young man.They stared blankly at the young man who was talking jovially with Old Xue and Old Qin.No wonder he did not regard the Gong, Wu, So, and Bi Families highly. No wonder he dared to come to this banquet in casual dressing.He did not have to care, and he had no need to care about any of them.This symbolized power. Aren\u2019t Old Xue and Old Qin in casual wear too?At this moment, Guan Shicheng, who was in the middle of the crowd, was in a daze.He was looking in disbelief at the young man who was sharing a jovial conversation with Old Xue and Old Qin.The thought of the young man addressing him as Uncle with smiles on his face.The thought of him treating the young man coldly, scornfully and even\u2026He regretted it very much. If I could reverse everything, I would surely hold on to him. Definitely\u2026\u201cWhy, why did this happen?\u201d Guan Shicheng felt restless. It was such a good opportunity for the rising of Guan Family again.At this time, he saw Director Qin walking towards him. He was slightly uptight and fearful.\u201cMiss Guan, Niece Lan.\u201dGuan Shicheng noticed that Director Qin was walking towards his daughter.\u201cUncle Qin!\u201d Lan Qingyue answered politely.\u201cDirector Qin.\u201d Guan Shuqing nodded to Qin Lianhui. They had been having lunch in the afternoon just now.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss Guan, to have let you suffer some injustice.\u201d Director Qin apologized to Guan Shuqing.\u201cNo, no,\u201d Guan Shuqing quickly shook her head. \u201cWith Xiao Xian around, I didn\u2019t suffer much.\u201d\u201cRight, there is Wang Xian around!\u201d Qin Lianhui laughed. He turned to Guan Shicheng and smiled, \u201cDirector Guan, we will discuss your matter later. \u201d\u201cDirector Qin!\u201d Guan Shicheng was stunned. Upon seeing the other party\u2019s smiling face, he suddenly got excited. He looked towards his daughter and thought of some possibilities.Piak! Piak!Guan Shicheng walked to his daughter and slapped himself on his face, \u201cGirl, it\u2019s all my fault. It\u2019s all my fault. Don\u2019t blame me!\u201dWhen Guan Shuqing saw her father walking towards her, she was feeling complicated. She sighed softly. After all, this was her father.\u201cDad, I don\u2019t blame you at all!\u201d Guan Shuqing shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you don\u2019t blame me. I\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Guan Shicheng nodded with a smile. He hesitated before he asked, \u201cGirl, what\u2019s the relationship between you and that young man?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen Guan Shicheng posed that question to Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue was also anxious to hear the answer.\u201cFriends, we\u2019re just friends.\u201d Guan Shuqing replied, knowing what her father was thinking.\u201cJust friends?\u201d Guan Shicheng was a little disappointed.He was hoping that the young man could be the boyfriend of his daughter, and his son-in-law. If that were the case, who would dare to offend him, Guan Shicheng, and the entire Guan Family in the future?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - A Storm In The Banquet (End)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62: A Storm In The Banquet (End)Larbrestudio\u201cI\u2019d like to go over and say \u201chi\u201d to two friends of mine. Old Qin and Old Xue, please have a chat now.\u201dThe banquet continued as per normal. Although the atmosphere had changed a little, the impacts weren\u2019t that great.After informing Old Qin and Old Xue, Wang Xian turned his attention to the banquet hall and headed towards where Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue were.Feeling the intentional and unintentional gazes from the crowd, the edge of Wang Xian\u2019s mouth started to arch up.\u201cChairman Lan, thank you.\u201dWang Xian saw Guan Shuqing was talking to her parents and thus went over to Lan Qingyue to express his gratitude first.Just a while ago, Lan Qingyue had to endure the huge pressure from the crowd to put in good words for him. Lending a helping hand when one was in need was tough, while sucking up to one when he was basking in the light of success was easy. She belonged to the former.He was a little surprised that Lan Qingyue had chosen to help him but was also grateful to her.Lan Qingyue, who was in a red evening gown, looked extremely alluring under the warm lights of the banquet hall. While wearing high heels, she was approximately the same height as Wang Xian.Her beauty couldn\u2019t be appropriately described with words.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Lan Qingyue looked at him with fervent eyes. As compared to their previous encounter, she felt that the strange quality of Wang Xian had gotten stronger by a little.\u201cIt\u2019s too heart-breaking that you have rejected my invitation for a meal twice to thank you for the previous incident!\u201d Lan Qingyue looked at him and recalled his rejections. She couldn\u2019t help but comment unhappily.\u201cHehe.\u201d Wang Xian laughed awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019ve really been a little busy in the last two days. However, if you would like to have a meal together, you can come to my restaurant. I\u2019m staying there for almost the entire time each day. I could also give you a treat!\u201d\u201cYour restaurant? Great!\u201d Upon hearing his reply, Lan Qingyue revealed a faint smile and nodded her head. \u201cIn that case, we have a deal.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.Just beside them, Guan Shicheng felt his head aching when he saw Lan Qingyue and Wang Xian chatting.He naturally knew who Lan Qingyue was, as she was the future successor to the Lan Family. Her family wealth was among the top three in Rivertown currently.Moreover, there was nothing one could pick on about Lan Qingyue\u2019s looks. Within the entire Rivertown, she was at the highest level.Seeing how she had tried to protect Wang Xian a while ago, he was able to tell something from it.When it came to looks, he was confident that his daughter wasn\u2019t inferior to Lan Qingyue. However, when it came to family background, the difference was stark.It was especially so after what he said previously. At the thought of this, he started to regret further.He wasn\u2019t just feeling regretful but also feeling a sense of danger. If his son-in-law was snatched away, it would be pointless for him to cry over it then.Guan Shicheng\u2019s expression was changing constantly. He was thinking of ways to get on the good books of Wang Xian and also to make up for what he\u2019d done previously.Guan Shuqing saw Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue chatting joyously and was feeling a little uncomfortable about it.After finishing his chat with Lan Qingyue, Wang Xian turned his head and smiled at Guan Shuqing. He walked over and asked, \u201cShuqing, are you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Guan Shuqing nodded her head. She looked at him and said, \u201cThank you, Xiao Xian.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and shook his head.\u201cSon-in-law, I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m really sorry. I was wrong in the incident previously. It\u2019s all my fault! Please forgive me.\u201dAt this moment, Guan Shicheng came over shamelessly and spoke with a sincere face. He was even calling Wang Xian his son-in-law.Wang Xian was taken aback and so was Guan Shuqing.He had not expected Guan Shuqing\u2019s father to be so shameless.\u201cFather, what are you calling him!\u201d Guan Shuqing\u2019s face had turned red while speaking to her father.\u201cHehe.\u201d Guan Shicheng continued smiling and said to Wang Xian once again, \u201cI was foolish and timid previously. Please don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201dWang Xian was speechless while looking at Guan Shicheng. The current him was completely different as compared to when he first saw Wang Xian.What an opportunistic person!Wang Xian wasn\u2019t too calculative with him, as he was Guan Shuqing\u2019s father after all. However, he wasn\u2019t being too close and friendly with him either. He shook his head, smiled, and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201cAs long as you are fine with it! Have a chat with Shuqing first while I get some food together with her mother. Come over to our house for dinner when you\u2019re free! I\u2019ll get my wife to make you some delicious food.\u201d Guan Shicheng could feel that Wang Xian was keeping a distance from him. However, he was rather thick-skinned and spoke solicitously.Wang Xian nodded his head. \u201cSure, uncle.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d Guan Shicheng heaved a huge sigh of relief. He turned around and walked towards a woman by the side.\u201cXiao Xian, my father is a little\u2026 I hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Guan Shuqing said as she looked at her father.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. After which, he turned to Guan Shuqing and said, \u201cThis is Lan Qingyue. Shuqing, I believe you know her too.\u201d\u201cHello!\u201d Lan Qingyue looked at Guan Shuqing, smiled, extended her hand and greeted.\u201cHello!\u201d Guan Shuqing also looked at Lan Qingyue and extended her hand.A special force field was formed between the two of them.When the young men in the banquet hall looked over and saw these two gorgeous ladies, they couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly shock.At the same time, they were envious of the teenager standing beside them.\u201cYou girls are really charming.\u201d Feeling the surrounding gazes, Wang Xian smiled and complimented them.\u201cJunior Shuqing is really beautiful and has attracted everyone attention.\u201d Lan Qingyue smiled and commented.\u201cIt\u2019s senior\u2019s charisma that is stronger. I\u2019m still a long way behind.\u201d Guan Shuqing replied immediately.The atmosphere was slightly strange.\u201cHaha, both of you are beautiful.\u201d The insensitive Wang Xian didn\u2019t notice and simply complimented the two girls.This caused the two girls to break into laughter while looking at each other.\u201cWang Xian, I have to go greet some people with my uncle. Don\u2019t forget that you will be treating me to a meal,\u201d Lan Qingyue smiled and said to Wang Xian.\u201cAlright, go do what you have to.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head.Subsequently, Wang Xian chatted with Guan Shuqing for a while before heading towards where Old Qin and Old Xue were at.Old Qin introduced him to some people in Rivertown. There were businessmen and also officials working in the government.For a guy that could make Old Qin bow down to apologize, they naturally wouldn\u2019t dare to be lax in entertaining as they were full of smiles while conversing with Wang Xian.Through this banquet, Wang Xian obtained a lot of name cards. When he walked out of the banquet hall, it was already 11 o\u2019clock at night.After bidding goodbye to Old Qin, Old Xue, Lan Qingyue, Guan Shuqing and her parents, Wang Xian rode his heavy-duty motorcycle towards school.As the cold wind blew on him, Wang Xian was feeling very comfortable. After today, he could be considered as having a strong foothold in Rivertown.What would come next was to strengthen himself.The moon was bright and Wang Xian was heading back to school on his heavy-duty motorcycle. The trees along the pathways were moving past him rapidly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere were barely any other people or cars left on the roads.Just as Wang Xian was coming to a curve, a black shadow crashed towards him.Screech!Wang Xian was slightly shocked and immediately slammed on his brakes. Sharp grinding noises propagated as the motorcycle\u2019s wheels scratched against the road.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With a pale-looking face, he looked towards the trees and bushes at the roadside with a despairing expression.\u201cMo Qinglong, you can\u2019t run away. Hand over the thing now, and I\u2019ll let you have a peaceful death.\u201dSoon after, an angry bellow was heard, Wang Xian saw eight men rushing towards his side.They were like the martial arts experts on the television who leaped onto the tree branch and landed on the road in front of him.The eight of them were dressed uniformly in black costumes. The swords in their hands were flickering with cold radiance under the moonlight.A middle-aged man in the center stepped forward and glared coldly at the elder on the ground.\u201cGreen Lotus Ancient Sect, the so-called decent sect, stooped to using despicable and shameless resorts just to steal the treasure from the Ancient Fiend Clan.\u201d The old man stood up slowly with hideous expressions on his face.\u201cHaha, the Ancient Fiend Clan has always been up to no good. We are going to uproot your clan and finish off all the assassins that the clan has cultivated. We\u2019re doing this for the good of the people. Mo Qinglong, don\u2019t ever think of escaping today. Hand over the Five Elements Stone Plate now.\u201d The middle-aged man in the center was glaring at the old man with immense killing intent. He stared at the chest area of the old man with greed in his eyes.\u201cUnless you kill me, you bunch of hypocrites will never ever get it.\u201d The old man was covered in blood with numerous cuts on his body.His clothes were getting soaked in his fresh blood.\u201cThen we\u2019ll kill you.\u201d The middle-aged man in the center had an impassive look. He looked towards both sides and commanded, \u201cKill him. We must get the Five Elements Stone Plate.\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d The rest of the seven members nodded and launched swift attacks at the old man.One of them suddenly looked up and fixed his gaze on the spot where Wang Xian was.\u201cCount yourself unlucky today.\u201d As he spoke, he flung his arm and hurled a dagger at Wang Xian.Without looking at him, the man turned to attack the old man.In his opinion, Wang Xian could be considered a dead man.It was an unexpected misfortune to any commoners.Wang Xian was about to take his leave when he saw what happened. But his eyes could not help but narrow when he saw the dagger flying towards him.How tyranical of them. I\u2019m just a passer-by.Wang Xian squinted his eyes as he looked at the incoming dagger. He stretched his arm out.Piak!The dagger was easily grasped by Wang Xian.Back in the fight, the old man was besieged by eight people, and soon, he took another two slashes on his body.The old man\u2019s strength should be around Level Eight, and only the middle-aged leader is on par with him. The remaining Martial Artists are all at Level Seven.Radiance flickered in Wang Xian\u2019s eyes. He got down from his Harley motorcycle slowly and gazed at the eight people with a cold look.\u201cIf it were not for you who wanting to kill me, I would have never interfered in this. But now, it\u2019s a good chance for me to test my skill.\u201dWang Xian curled his fingers into a fist. He was wearing his helmet, but he was not afraid that someone would recognize him.Ka Ka Ka!The dagger in his hand was crunched into a ball and discarded on the floor.\u201cI\u2019m just a passer-by, yet, you guys wanted to silence me. Fine. If that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s have some fun.\u201dWang Xian moved as he talked. He sprang into action and attacked the closest middle-aged man.\u201cCourting your own death. Qingwen and Qinglie, kill him!\u201d The middle-aged leader was looking cold as he commanded loudly after Wang Xian dodged the dagger and attacked them.\u201cLad, never did I expect that you\u2019re a Martial Artist too. However, you are bound to die today!\u201d The two middle-aged men, Qingwen and Qinglie, took themselves out from the joint attack of the old man and looked towards Wang Xian. Immediately, they made a counterattack.\u201cHeh heh!\u201dThere was only coldness in Wang Xian\u2019s eyes. Even though he had a good temper, his killing intent was triggered when he met a bunch of people who wanted to kill him without any reason.The two middle-aged men wielded their sharp and long swords at his chest and throat.\u201cHave a taste of my physical power!\u201dThe Dragon Energy in Wang Xian\u2019s body surged. He stretched out both his hands and grabbed the two sharp swords.\u201cDie!\u201d The two men looked at him disdainfully as they spun the long swords in their hands. \u201cGo to hell.\u201dPiak Piak!However, what shocked them was both swords were caught, and their attacks were stopped.Ka Ka Ka!\u201cOh no!\u201dTheir eyes were filled with disbelief as they noticed the long swords in their hands were giving way.\u201cDie!\u201dWang Xian hurled himself forward and attacked one of the middle-aged men.He had not learned any martial arts before and had little experience in real-life combat. However, the power and speed of the Divine Dragon were insurmountable.He held his fist tightly. With his mighty strength, he swung his fist at the middle-aged man who was looking shocked and horrified. He wielded his sword across his chest for defense.Ka!The sword broke when the sound was heard. The domineering force struck onto the chest of the middle-aged man.Bam! The middle-aged man felt as though his chest had exploded. His eyes were protruding out as he stared at Wang Xian with disbelief.\u201cDamm, we met an expert!\u201d The other man who witnessed the instant death of Qinglie was horrified. Hence, he quickly called out.\u201cDidn\u2019t you guys say you were going to kill me?\u201d Wang Xian lifted his head and stared ferociously at that middle-aged man. Like a raging beast, he struck an attack with brutal force.\u201cGreen Lotus Sword Dance!\u201dThat middle-aged man was horrified to see Wang Xian charging at him like a raging beast. He wielded the long sword in his hand, and an image of a green lotus appeared before him.The green lotus was carrying a bone-chilling cold radiance with it.\u201cFancy but impractical.\u201dDespite seeing the Green Lotus Sword formation, Wang Xian did not have the slightest hesitation. He continued punching his fist out.Ka Ka Ka!When the sleeves on Wang Xian\u2019s arm were torn, it sounded like shattering glasses.Blood traces could be seen on his arm, but they recovered almost instantly because of the mighty Divine Dragon\u2019s body.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d When the middle-aged man let out a devastating scream, Wang Xian\u2019s fist already landed on his chest. Immediately, his chest sank in, and he collapsed on the floor.\u201cDamm, Qingwen and Qinglie got killed!\u201dThe devastating screams from Qingwen and Qinglie drew shocking exclamations of those middle-aged men who were attacking the old man as they watched in disbelief.Initially, they thought they killed an ordinary passer-by just to conceal the secret. But no one expected that he was a formidable Martial Artist who killed two Level-seven Martial Artists instantly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLevel-seven Martial Artists were experts who could establish an Ancient Martial Artist Family in this world.\u201cI was only passing through this place, and yet, you guys wanted to kill me.

He looked to the middle-aged leader and started laughing, \u201cShame on the Green Lotus Ancient Sect to claim to be an orthodox Sect but ambush an ordinary person in order to silence him. Yet, you would have never expected him to be so strong. Haha!\u201d\u201cBrother, thank you for lending me a helping hand. If you can help me eliminate this group of sanctimonious people, I will give you what they are trying to snatch away from me.\u201dThe expressions on the six middle-aged men\u2019s faces, who were cornering the old man, changed drastically. They had never expected themselves to encounter this situation. They had been used to being arrogant and thinking nothing of killing an ordinary man.However, they had never expected Wang Xian to be so terrifying.The middle-aged leader held the knife firmly in his hand and stared at Wang Xian with bloodthirst.\u201cThis is between the Green Lotus Ancient Sect and Ancient Fiend Clan. I hope that this brother wouldn\u2019t interfere and we would reward you handsomely after everything!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dWang Xian wasn\u2019t shaken at all by the words of the middle-aged leader. He had zero affection for the six people in front of him and charged directly towards the one who was closest to him.\u201cKill! Even if I, Mo Qinglong, was to lose my life, I want all of you to die with me!\u201d When Mo Qinglong saw Wang Xian make his move, his eyes lit up. The black aura around him started surging violently. Disregarding his injuries, he charged and attacked towards the surrounding six people.\u201cShit!\u201dWhen the middle-aged leader saw them attacking, his face turned gloomy. \u201cYou guys try to pin down Mo Qinglong while I go and take care of that brat.\u201d\u201cYes, Sect Leader!\u201d The other five people gripped their swords tightly and set up a Sword Formation towards Mo Qinglong.\u201cDo you think the five of you are enough to trap me? Even when I\u2019m severely injured, you guys still aren\u2019t a match for me!\u201d The dark hair of Mo Qinglong was flying freely and the dark aura around his body was surging towards the surroundings.At the other end, Wang Xian revealed a heavy look upon seeing the middle-aged man attacking towards him.He realized that the speed of the middle-aged man was slightly quicker than him.Martial Artist Level Eight! I wonder if my body could withstand an attack from a Level Eight Martial Artist?Wang Xian had a gloomy look. With his current strength, he could go against and kill Level Seven Martial Artists. As for Level Eight Martial Artists, he wasn\u2019t certain. Nonetheless, he wasn\u2019t fearful.\u201cDie, you damn brat!\u201d The middle-aged man moved the sword in his hand and a cold glow pierced toward Wang Xian.So fast!Wang Xian was a little shocked when he saw the sword of the middle-aged man. Adjusting his body posture, he dodged to the side.\u201cCan you dodge this?\u201d The middle-aged man looked at Wang Xian with disdain and swung his arm across.Sss!The sword cut along Wang Xian\u2019s arm and left a three inches long wound on it.However, the wound wasn\u2019t deep, but looked severe.Indeed! A Level Eight Martial Artist could injure me!Seeing the wound on his arm regenerating gradually, Wang Xian looked towards the middle-aged leader with alertness.\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about martial arts techniques and you dared to mess with us?\u201dThe middle-aged leader knew Wang Xian didn\u2019t know any martial arts technique with just a look. He looked at him with disdain and said, \u201cYou can die now!\u201dAs he finished his sentence, the sword in his hands moved in a mesmerizing manner. In the end, countless sword shadows intersected together to form a sharp sword that slashed towards Wang Xian.Poof!Wang Xian took a deep breath as he saw the sharp sword slashing towards him. If he was hit, he would definitely be severely injured.However, he felt no fear at all. \u201cLet\u2019s see how powerful the dragon ball is!\u201dHe opened his mouth slightly and a quail-egg size dragon ball flew out of his mouth. It was burning in crimson red flame and flew towards the middle-aged man at a horrifying speed.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d The middle-aged man was shocked when he saw a fireball-like object flying towards him. He immediately swung his sword and slashed directly at it.With a change in thought, the dragon ball made a creepy curve and avoided the sword. Instead, it landed on the arm of the middle-aged leader.Argh!A horrifying shriek pierced through the night. To the horror of the middle-aged man, the little fireball-like object had landed on his hand and was quickly disintegrating his body.In just a split second, a hole appeared on his arm. Terror overwhelmed him when he noticed that his chest area seemed to have been \u201ccooked\u201d.It was \u201ccooked\u201d under the intense heat!The middle-aged man\u2019s eyes were wide opene and were filled with disbelief. He stared towards Wang Xian and his eyes were filled with despair.\u201cIf you try to kill others, be ready to be killed!\u201dWang Xian spoke slowly to the middle-aged leader. With just a thought, the dragon ball went through the body of the middle-aged leader.In that instant, the body of the middle-aged man was turned into dust! Nope! Under the high temperature, not even ashes were left behind!Controlling it with his mind, the dragon ball flew towards the other two corpses. When it went through them, nothing was left.\u201cShit! Sect leader is killed!\u201dAt this moment, a horrifying shriek propagated from the side. They had never expected their Sect Leader to be killed.Their gazes swept by Wang Xian and their bodies were trembling in fear.Why the hell did we mess with this expert?\u201cHaha, all of you shall die too!\u201d Mo Qinglong saw them being distracted. Instantly, the black gas around him surged more violently and swept towards the five of them.\u201cShit!\u201d\u201cArgh! No!\u201d \u201dSeveral horrified screams filled the air. The five middle-aged men were defending hopelessly. However, they were all slain by the old man.Cough cough cough!Mo Qinglong spat out blood after slaying the five middle-aged men. He was barely holding up as his body was emitting its last stretch of vitality. He was on the verge of death!The escape and desperate counterattack a while ago had exhausted all of his life force.\u201cThank you, brother!\u201d \u201dWith all his might, he tried to maintain his posture, and revealed a pitiful smile at Wang Xian.Wang Xian looked at the old man and started to frown.Cough cough! Mo Qinglong coughed violently and spat out blood once again. He grabbed something from his waist slowly and said, \u201cThis is what those orthodox sects tried to snatch from us. Since they didn\u2019t get it, I shall give it to you, brother.\u201dAs he finished his sentence, Mo Qinglong fell to the ground directly, as though he had expended all his strength.Wang Xian looked at the old man quietly. Suddenly, he had an idea, walked to the side of Mo Qinglong and carried him up.As the dragon ball swept through the battling scene, the surrounding corpses vanished into the thin air.Looking at the baggage in the old man\u2019s hand, Wang Xian carried the old man and sat onto his heavy-duty motorcycle. After which, he rode towards the seaside.At the seaside, Wang Xian carried the old man and jumped into the water directly. He didn\u2019t transform into a divine dragon and simply swam towards the sea.In less than 20 minutes, Wang Xian arrived at the deserted island where clam girl was at.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWang Xian threw the old man on the ground.

Those that attained great achievements in their cultivation could even transform from humans into dragons.Of course, it was an arduous thing to do so.The development of Dragonians and marine animals was somewhat similar. The only difference was the speed of their cultivations. Not only did the Dragonians cultivate slower than the marine animals, but they also had to cultivate according to their own physique conditions.That is, they had to work step by step by cultivating their eight extraordinary meridians first.However, this was not required from the Divine Dragons. Divine Dragons just needed to absorb Dragon Energy to evolve and strengthen their physical bodies.That is to say, the human cultivation technique was invalid for Wang Xian.Gazing at the old man who was at the verge of his death, Wang Xian stretched out his hand. The golden drop of blood which appeared in his palm dripped on his glabella.Suddenly, the head of the old man jerked.\u201cIf you wish to live, absorb it, and don\u2019t resist it!\u201d Wang Xian said to the old man upon seeing his resistance.The old man calmed down, and the blood of the Divine Dragon entered his brain.An agreement was formed, and the old man had to serve Wang Xian as his Master from now on.\u201cLet\u2019s heal him first!\u201d On seeing the completion of the contract, Wang Xian smiled and placed his palm against the chest of the old man.Streams of immense Dragon Energy entered his body.The old man was obviously stretching himself way too far as all his internal organs were barely functioning. Hence, his body quickly absorbed the nourishment of Dragon Energy.At the same time, the golden dragon blood flowed through his entire body, making him in possession of the bloodline of Divine Dragon.Both the dragon blood and Dragon Energy caused the old man to develop tiny dragon scales on his body, which made him look formidable.\u201cAfter becoming a Dragonian, his defense ability and vitality would increase by two to three folds. A strong Dragonian could upgrade his arms into dragon claws, and bring out his own dragon tail for combat purposes.\u201dWang Xian thought to himself. As he felt the Internal Energy circulating in the old man\u2019s body, he suddenly had an idea.For humans to make a breakthrough in their eight extraordinary meridians, they had to work step by step before they could advance. What if Wang Xian uses his own Dragon Energy to help him with it?Would that speed up the cultivation? Without the slightest hindrance?Wang Xian pondered. He hesitated, but he tried to direct his Dragon Energy to the old man\u2019s eight extraordinary meridians.Currently, only his Conception Vessel and Governing Vessel were blocked. Once they were unblocked, he would become the Inborn Expert.An Inborn Expert was good enough to lead a force.Wang Xian sensed where his two vessels were and tried to unblock with streams of Dragon Energy.Bobo!A subtle sound came from the old man\u2019s body while his Internal Energy was circulating frantically within him.\u201cIt works!\u201d Sharp radiance flashed in his eyes. After depleting over 100 points of Dragon Energy, he really unblocked his Conception Vessel and Governing Vessel.\u201cIf I could unblock someone\u2019s meridian, that means I can build a powerful army in the shortest possible time.\u201dWang Xian was excited. Just then, the old man who was lying on the floor suddenly sat up.His expression changed drastically, and his eyes were wide open when he learned something new.He raised his head slowly and looked at Wang Xian, who was beside him as his body trembled.\u201cDragon King!\u201d He bowed, \u201cThank you, Dragon King, for bestowing a new life to me. I\u2019ll lay down my life and fight for you!\u201dMo Qinglong was shocked, excited, and full of disbelief.According to the information in his mind, he had become an immortal Dragonian. All this was given to him by the legendary Dragon King before him.\u201cYou may rise!\u201d Wang Xian was pleased with the respectful Mo Qinglong.\u201cYes, Dragon King!\u201d Mo Qinglong stood up and stayed by the side respectfully.\u201cYou\u2019re my first Dragonian subordinate. In the future, you\u2019ll also become the leader of the powerful Dragonian army. Now, you\u2019ll need to find a batch of loyal subjects so that I can upgrade them to Dragonians,\u201d said Wang Xian to Mo Qinglong.\u201cYes, Dragon King. Leave this to me!\u201d Mo Qinglong hastily answered, \u201cI was the elder of the Ancient Fiend Clan. Our clan was in hot water after we obtained the treasure, Five Elements Stone Plate, by chance. All the disciples of the Ancient Fiend Clan were killed except for a bunch of assassins who hid themselves during their training and escaped the calamity.\u201d\u201cBut they aren\u2019t any powerful assassins. Just ordinary people.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d Sharp radiance flashed across his eyes, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter even if they are weak. Just gather all of them first.\u201d\u201cYes, Dragon King!\u201d Mo Qinglong nodded his head obediently.\u201cIs this the Five Elements Stone Plate that you mentioned? What\u2019s the use of it?\u201d Wang Xian picked up the bundle on the floor and opened it.\u201cYes!\u201d Mo Qinglong nodded his head as he stared at the bundle with fiery eyes. \u201cThe Five Elements Stone Plate is a very magical treasure. So far, we have not fully grasped its functions. We only know that cultivation speed can increase by five fold with this around. It can also heal injuries, which makes it powerful!\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d Wang Xian opened up the bundle, revealing the Five Elements Stone Plate.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Wang Xian\u2019s eyes were wide open as he looked at the stone plate in front of him. The stone was glimmering in five different pure colors, namely the gold, green, white, red, and yellow.The Five Elements Source Stone marked the source of five elements. Wood fuels fire. Fire creates Earth. Earth bears Metal. Metal collects Water. Water nourishes Wood.Extractable Dragon Energy: Energy is too high to be extracted.\u201cThe Five Elements Source Stone! It\u2019s the Five Elements Source Stone!\u201d Wang Xian\u2019s body shook with excitement.The so-called Source Stone was the Origin Source which represented a form of limitation.For example, if Wang Xian practiced fire attributes, his body would transform into the Origin of Inferno when he mastered the ninth transformation of Nine Divine Dragon Transformations. He could easily control all the fire in the world with his mind.And the Origin of Inferno was represented by the red portion on this Five Elements Source Stone.Same goes for the water and metal attributes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAccording to the art of cultivation of Divine Dragon Transformation, the Divine Dragon must choose an attribute when it masters the First Transformation. Subsequently, it must cultivate according to its attribute. But there was a legendary attribute known as the Five Elements Attribute. It was the most powerful attribute of all, as five elements reinforce and counteract each other.\u201d\u201cRelying solely on the Cultivation Arts to cultivate Five Elements Attribute was not enough. It would require a treasury auxiliary, and that is the power of the Origin Source of Attribute. At the same time, the auxiliary must possess the integration power from the Inborn Origin Source of Five Elements Attribute that almost doesn\u2019t exist in this world.\u201dWang Xian stared at the Five Elements Source Stone passionately. The five colors were connected to each other, exuding a magnificent and imposing power.\u201cI\u2019ll merge this stone with my body and proceed with the five elements cultivation. When I master the First Transformation, I will become the legendary Five Elements Divine Dragon!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wang Xian sat on the seabed and scratched the Five Elements Source Stone with his dragon claws.\u201cEvolution: Five-Elements Divine Dragon!\u201dWang Xian shouted softly. The Five Element Source Stone was emitting 5 different colored lights as it entered Wang Xian\u2019s body gradually.In that instant, his body glowed in 5 different colors and his body was no longer just gold in color.\u201cEvolution: Five-Elements Divine Dragon!\u201dA voice exploded in Wang Xian\u2019s mind and his dragon\u2019s body started cracking.His body was growing at a rapid pace from three meters to five meters. Moreover, the color of its body was also undergoing major changes.His head was blue, the color of the water. His pair of claws and dragon horns were golden in color. His body was a dull shade of yellow with a tinge of green.As for his tail, it was red. His entire body reflected the colors of the Five Elements: Metal, water, wood, fire and ground.Wang Xian felt that his dragon claws seemed to have been completely turned into metal and were capable of splitting metal and shattering stones. His head could control the flow of water and his body had a thick defense with strong regeneration capability.As for his tail, it was filled with violent power.There were five different types of colors connected to one another, complementing and restricting each element. [1]Rawrr!Wang Xian couldn\u2019t help but let out a dragon\u2019s roar which resounded in a radius of several dozens of miles. All the marine animals within this range were all looking towards his direction in horror.Some of them were even trembling in fear while lying flat on the seabed as though they were paying respect to Wang Xian.So strong! I\u2019m so strong now! Wang Xian could feel the destructive strength that filled his body.Looking across, he could see all the living animals in a radius of one kilometer and all the marine animals within several kilometers. With just a thought, he could control them.Absolutely horrifying!Name: Wang XianRace: Five Elements Divine Dragon (Able to transform into a human)Level: SixDragon Energy: 564,421/100,000,000Superpower:\u00a0Dominate the marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animals that are lower than your own level)Devour any form of living (For extraction of dragon energy)Five Elements ControlArt of Cultivation: Divine Dragon TransformationMy level increased three times to Level Six and I got a new superpower!Wang Xian\u2019s eyes lit up as he felt his unprecedented strength.With a body of 5 meters, he was considered rather large in the seas. Moreover with his current strength, he could easily kill any types of sharks. In fact, he could even kill a school of tiger whales.Five Elements Control!With a thought, he opened up his dragon claw and a sharp metal longsword appeared in his hand.When he opened his mouth slightly, a ball of water appeared from within.When he swayed his tail slightly, the scorching temperature that was emitting from the tail could reach the might of the dragon ball.I\u2019m so strong now. Even if I encounter an Inborn expert, he wouldn\u2019t be a match for me!Wang Xian was filled with confidence. From here onwards, he would also be an existence that could rule over an area.\u201cDragon King!\u201dAt this moment, clam girl, who had been around, swam over. She opened her shell and revealed her human form.\u201cHaha, I\u2019m in a really good mood today. Here is some dragon energy for you!\u201dWang Xian looked at clam girl and revealed a smile. With a wave of his golden claws, a stream of dragon energy entered clam girl\u2019s body.\u201cThank you, Dragon King!\u201dThe clam girl shivered and absorbed the dragon energy rapidly. Her form was getting closer and closer to a human and the shell behind her was emitting a blinding glow. At the same time, her level had increased to Level Seven.\u201cRoving girl, did you catch any top-quality seafood over the last few days? \u201cWang Xian asked Roving Girl.\u201cDragon King, I\u2019ve found some abalones as you described near this island.\u201d Moving her body, she controlled the water flow and pointed to a direction.Oh? Abalone? Wang Xian revealed a shocked expression. \u201cBring me over to take a look.\u201d\u201cYes, Dragon King!\u201d Roving Girl nodded her head. As she moved her body, she went ahead and led the way.Wang Xian moved his tail slightly. His current speed was horrifying in the seas currently and few marine animals could match his speed.A five meters long Five Elements divine dragon was starting to have its majestic look.Under the island was a patch of chaotic rocks. Clam girl led him towards the opposite direction where Wang Xian came from.In that direction, green seaweeds were all over the surface of the rocks.\u201cDragon King, look! The abalones that you\u2019ve described!\u201dClam girl pointed to an abalone in the cracks between a rock. She controlled the flow of water and swept the abalone towards her directly.\u201cThis is\u2026 Two-headed abalone!\u201dWhen Wang Xian saw the abalones in front of him, his eyes lit up and revealed a shocked expression.An abalone is considered a \u201cTwo-headed abalone\u201d when just two of them weighs a catty.Two-headed abalone was a very rare and precious animal. A single two-headed abalone would fetch at least $400,000 \u2013 $500,000.Even so, one might not even get one with money. This was something that an ordinary rich person could eat.Wang Xian looked to clam girl with joy and asked, \u201cAre there more of these abalone?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Clam girl nodded her head and swam to the side. Controlling the water flow, she swept an even larger abalone over.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dWang Xian was speechless when he saw this abalone. It was at least the size of two palms, had a heavy and thick shell and dull-yellow flesh.\u201cOne-headed Abalone. Oh my gosh, this is a one-headed abalone that is worth several million for one!\u201dWang Xian was exhilarated. He opened up his claws and held it with his own hand.Abalone! This was the highest-quality ingredient available!Just this abalone alone would be more than $2 million. Moreover, it would at most be enough for two people.$2 million for a meal? Who could have afforded it?\u201cRoving girl, get me all the abalone in the surrounding area,\u201d Wang Xian ordered loudly.Roving girl nodded her head. Moving her body, she started to catch the abalones within the cracks of the rocks.Soon, 20-30 abalones appeared within the area she was controlling.Among which, there were several one-headed abalones and two-headed abalones that were similar to those in Wang Xian\u2019s hand.There was 1 one-headed abalone and 4 two-headed abalone. As for the rest, they were either three-headed abalones or four-headed abalones.\u201cDragon King, this is a portion of the abalones.\u201dIn less than 10 minutes, abalones were densely packed around Roving Girl. There were approximately 100 of them.\u201cGreat, that\u2019s enough!\u201dWang Xian was overwhelmed. Among the abalones in front of him, there were approximately 5 one-headed abalones, 15 two-headed abalones and the rest were three-headed abalones or four-headed abalones.\u201cIf I place these in the restaurants, it would definitely cause a commotion. These are one-headed abalones and two-headed abalones that are close to impossible to find within the country!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWang Xian recalled a piece of news that he had seen. Someone dried a two-headed abalone and preserved it under perfect conditions. After which, he used it as a family heirloom. From this, one could see the value of a two-headed abalone, let alone a one-headed abalone.Lobsters and abalones\u2026 If I could get some Chinese Bahaba fish and Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, it would be perfect. At that time, no restaurants would be able to match the top-quality ingredients of First-grade restaurant!Endnote:[1] This concept comes from Chinese Geomancy where one element complements one other element while restricting another. For example, water aids (complements) the growth of wood while also putting out (restricting) fire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He headed towards the spot where the Roving Lobster was at.Roar!A dragon roar was heard in the area filled with messy reefs. All the marine animals in the region were shuddering.Soon, Roving Lobster, with a pair of two-meters claws, swam quickly and lowered himself. \u201cMy respect to the Dragon King!\u201dWang Xian looked at the Level-four Roving Lobster and drew his lips. \u201cI\u2019m here to enhance your strength for your cultivation.\u201d\u201cThank you, Dragon King!\u201d The low-intelligence Roving Lobster said gratefully.Wang Xian swung his arm and instilled a stream of Dragon Energy into the body of Roving Lobster.Ka Ka Ka!The Roving Lobster gave off frying sound from his body. His body did not grow any bigger, but all his legs, including his claws, grew muscular.His pair of large claws, as sharp as razors, were about 1.5 meters long. His legs were about the same size as the human ones.Slowly, the Roving Lobster stood up. With a height of two meters, two out of eight legs were supporting his body. The rest of them looked extremely strong and durable.The two claws located on his head were exuding mightiness. This was the authentic Roving Lobster General.The Roving Lobster upgraded to Level Six after Wang Xian transferred 100,000 points of Dragon Energy.Compared to a Martial Artist, a Level-seven Martial Artist was no match for a Level-six Roving Lobster.\u201cGuard this land of lobsters. That would be sufficient.\u201d Sharp radiance flashed across Wang Xian\u2019s eyes.\u201cThank you, Dragon King!\u201d The Roving Lobster knelt again and said with gratefulness.\u201cCarry on with your cultivation!\u201dAfter leaving his instruction, he made a move and headed towards the island where Mo Qinglong was residing.When Wang Xian swam out of the water, Mo Qinglong immediately walked over humbly. \u201cDragon King!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Xian nodded and asked, \u201cWhen will your subordinates be arriving?\u201d\u201cDragon King, they will be here in no time!\u201d Mo Qinglong answered with respect.\u201cIn no time?\u201d Wang Xian looked at Mo Qinglong with astonishment. \u201cSo fast?\u201d\u201cDragon King, they were receiving military training. I called them just now, and they were not far away from the Rivertown. Now, they are on their way. I believe they will be here soon!\u201d Mo Qinglong replied.\u201cOh?\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head with sharp radiance in his eyes. He looked at the shore where a ship was sailing towards them, \u201cAre they here?\u201dMo Qinglong looked over and nodded his head, \u201cYes, it should be them!\u201d\u201cWhere did their ship come from?\u201d asked Wang Xian curiously.\u201cDragon King, as an elite assassin, getting a ship is a piece of cake,\u201d Mo Qinglong replied.\u201cGreat!\u201dWang Xian displayed a satisfied look while he waited quietly for the ship to arrive.\u201cGather here!\u201d When the ship docked, Mo Qinglong called out.\u201cMaster!\u201dA surprising voice was heard. Soon after, a middle-aged man, along with a team of young men, ran towards him.\u201cCome here!\u201d Mo Qinglong said in a low voice.\u201cYes!\u201dA group of people crowded around.Wang Xian swept his gaze across the people and noticed 50 fit and muscular young men. They were standing there uniformly without making the slightest sound.A chilling killing aura exuded from them.This bunch of people was not strong because they were from a sub-branch of the Ancient Fiend Clan, and none of them had learned Ancient Martial Arts.Besides, at their age, their meridians would have stiffened up. It would be extremely difficult to do any cultivation. Only the middle-aged leader was a Level-six Martial Artist.\u201cThis is the Dragon King, and he will be your king from now on too!\u201d Mo Qinglong told the 50 people.The middle-aged man leading the team revealed a shocking expression as he looked at his Master.\u201cI\u2019ll take you to another world!\u201dWang Xian walked to the center slowly as the Dragon Power gradually encompassed everyone.Boom!After the encompassing of the Dragon Power, the entire world seemed to have undergone a drastic change. Infinite oppression was suppressing them.\u201cDragon King!\u201d This group of well-trained assassins was horrified. They, including the middle-aged man in the lead, quickly knelt down on the ground.\u201cAll of you shall not resist.\u201dWang Xian swung his palm, and 50 drops of dragon blood emerged in his hands. He flung his arm and sent the blood to each of their glabellas.Everyone was horrified and dared not resist when they saw the skills he displayed.\u201cNext, I\u2019ll unblock your eight extraordinary meridians. During this period, you\u2019ll focus on your cultivation. In the shortest possible time, cultivate yourself to the Inborn Realm and become invincible masters!\u201dWang Xian swung his arm and injected a large amount of Dragon Energy into their bodies. He closed his eyes and unblocked all the meridians.Unblocking their meridians would not make them Inborn Experts immediately. They would still require absorbing Spiritual Energy.However, their absorption speed would increase by 100 times after unblocking their meridians.Roar!After all the medians were unblocked, they let out a soft dragon roar. All their clothes were torn into pieces by the domineering force. Faint dragon scales were attached to their bodies.\u201cThank you, Dragon King!\u201dAfter everyone absorbed the dragon blood, they clutched their fists tightly with excitement on their faces. They knelt, and their voices echoed through the sky.\u201cFrom now on, you\u2019ll be the security of the Dragon Palace, and will be known as the Dragon Sect from the Dragon Palace. The entire Dragon Sect would be led by Mo Qinglong,\u201d Wang Xian ordered them.\u201cYes, Dragon King!\u201dMo Qinglong knelt down before him thrillingly.\u201cFind a basecamp for everyone to cultivate!\u201d Wang Xian nodded and said slowly.\u201cDragon King, why don\u2019t we make this place the basecamp of the Dragon Sect?\u201d Mo Qinglong suggested while standing up.\u201cHere?\u201d Wang Xian observed the surrounding. The entire island had a size of 3,000 meters. The surface area was enough, but the island was too bleak.\u201cIt would take a lot of money to transform this place into the Dragon Sect!\u201d Wang Xian slightly frowned.\u201cDragon King, we have some funds here. Just enough for us to establish our basecamp.\u201d Mo Qinglong was exhilarated. \u201cBesides, my strength will reach the Inborn Realm soon. Till then, we can apply for this island to be the basecamp for the Dragon Sect.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201dWang Xian\u2019s eyes glimmered with sharp radiance. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the Dragon Sect to you.

That\u2019s right, it flew out like a deity.Naturally, the word \u201cflew\u201d might be exaggerating. Nonetheless, Wang Xian was able to jump over ten meters in a single leap.Since his level had increased to Level Six, his body had integrated the Five Elements Source Stone and had 5 elemental attributes of metal, wood, water, fire and earth in his body, Wang Xian\u2019s strength was a hundred times stronger.With a flick of his finger, a spark appeared within his hand. Moving it again, it was a metal dagger this time. Subsequently, there was a fireball, a block of earth and a piece of wood.However, what Wang Xian found the most interesting was that he could grow beautiful flowers on his palm with just a thought.This was the strength of the five elements and showed why the Five Elements Divine Dragon was the most horrifying.Wang Xian retracted his aura with a face of smiles and walked to his heavy-duty motorcycle. He rode it and headed towards First-grade Restaurant.When he reached First-grade Restaurant, it was already 9.30 a.m. and Guan Shuqing had arrived.\u201cXiao Xian, have you eaten?\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian with loving eyes and asked sweetly.Despite being upset by her father\u2019s actions during the banquet, she felt fortunate to have Wang Xian with her all along.Currently, her family would likely rise again with the Qin Family providing assistance. Moreover, her family would grow to be even stronger than before.Her parents were exhilarated and wanted her to grab hold of the opportunity to become Wang Xian\u2019s girlfriend.Although this made her speechless, she was secretly happy about it as her parents were no longer against her being together with Wang Xian.\u201cI haven\u2019t. Have you eaten? Wanna head out to grab some food?\u201d Wang Xian smiled and asked.\u201cI have already eaten. You could go by yourself.\u201d Guan Shuqing looked at him and smiled.Wang Xian nodded his head and headed out.The traffic on the old street was huge. Even though it was a morning in the summer, there were still quite a number of pedestrians in the surrounding area.Wang Xian looked around before heading towards a breakfast shop.\u201cLongxuan Restaurant will be opening in five days! Sir, please come and take a look.\u201dAt this moment, a girl walked to him with a flyer and handed it to him.Longxuan Restaurant?He took the flyer from the girl\u2019s hand inquisitively and took a look.Longxuan Restaurant will be opening in five days. On the day of the opening, everything will be sold at 50% of the original price. Subsequently, it will be 60% on the second day, 70% on the third day, 80% on the fourth day and 90% of on the fifth day.Longxuan Restaurant mainly sells all kinds of seafood and definitely has more variety than First-grade Restaurant. We have all kinds of valuable and precious seafood.At that time, we will be selling Two-headed abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin sashimi, delicious caviar and Australian lobsters.We welcome all guests to visit and taste our exquisite and delicious seafood. We would also be giving out attractive prizes!Wang Xian looked at the advertisement flyer in his hand before lifting his head to look at Longxuan Restaurant which was just a short distance away.At this moment, the renovation of Longxuan Restaurant was complete. Looking at its exterior, it wasn\u2019t inferior to First-grade Restaurant at all. In fact, it looked a little more luxurious, as it was a newly renovated restaurant after all.Everything at half price on opening day five days later? Claiming to have a wider variety of seafood than First-grade Restaurant?Wang Xian\u2019s eyes flickered and a faint cold smirk appeared on his face.\u201cEh, isn\u2019t this our Director Wang? What\u2019s the matter? Coming to learn more about your competitor?\u201d At this moment, a teasing voice sounded from beside him.He turned his head over and saw a young man followed by three other guys. The lips of the young man curved into a smile when he saw Wang Xian holding onto the advertisement flyer.Wang Xian looked at the young man and gave a cold smirk. \u201cI don\u2019t have to resort to finding more about your restaurant. My First-grade Restaurant has never been afraid of anyone!\u201d\u201cHaha, great. Director Wang is really confident!\u201d The young man looked at Wang Xian and smiled. His expression turned heavy as he continued, \u201cHowever, I wonder if Director Wang could stay as composed when his restaurant goes bankrupt.\u201d\u201cBankrupt? That\u2019s interesting. Let us wait and see who will be the first to declare bankruptcy.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and looked at them.\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see then! At that time, I\u2019ll let you know the strength of our Longxuan Restaurant.\u201d The young man gave a cold smile. \u201cIf you go bankrupt, I\u2019ll buy it from you for cheap!\u201d\u201cArrogant!\u201d Wang Xian looked at the young man and said in an emotionless tone.\u201cLad, you are still lacking a lot in comparison with my brother. As to what you are capable of, we have already investigated thoroughly. This time, we would hand you a complete defeat.\u201dAt this moment, the teenager beside the young man lifted his head and spoke to Wang Xian in a condescending manner.\u201cMy capabilities? It seems like you guys have been investigating me?\u201d Wang Xian\u2019s face sank.\u201cHehe. Know your enemy and you will not be defeated in a hundred battles! You are just a lucky brat.

Our Longxuan Restaurant\u2019s branch in this city is coming to this town like a hurricane and will triumph over the local First-grade Restaurant regardless of how strong it might be. Furthermore, he is just a worm after all.\u201dThe young man revealed a confident look.If he wasn\u2019t capable, he wouldn\u2019t have come to the area to set up his restaurant. In his eyes, the First-grade Restaurant was just a worm.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s right big brother. In five days\u2019 time, we will know who\u2019s the dragon and who\u2019s the worm!\u201d The teenager laughed excitedly.Longxuan Restaurant!Wang Xian looked at them as they left before looking at Longxuan Restaurant once again.

In his hand was an advertisement flyer.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Wang Xian saw his flustered look and asked.\u201cDirector Wang, Longxuan Restaurant has just started a strong and massive advertisement campaign by giving out flyers and employing the media at the same time. Their reach is really wide!\u201d Manager Huang replied in a hurry and passed the flyer to Wang Xian. \u201cThis was a flyer that I received from them.\u201d\u201cI knew about this.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and shook his head upon seeing the flyer.\u201cDirector Wang, you knew about this?\u201d Manager Huang was a little shocked but quickly added, \u201cDirector Wang, we need to get prepared. Longxuan Restaurant is a famous restaurant in the nearby city and they have strong capabilities. Moreover, their boss is a distant sea fishing group and has supplies with a range of top-quality ingredients. Please take a look at the menu that they are advertising.\u201d\u201cRelax! I have thought of how to handle this. As for now, the operations of First-grade Restaurant shall remain the same as before. It\u2019s just a Longxuan Restaurant. I\u2019ll make them close their shop quickly!\u201d Wang Xian said plainly.\u201cDirector Wang, you are confident?\u201d Manager Huang asked again, feeling a little doubtful.\u201cJust go and do what you have to do.\u201dWang Xian looked at him and smiled mysteriously.He had not brought over the large lobsters from the chaotic reef areas and the abalones from under the island.

He could not help but ask, \u201cDirector Wang, almost everyone in the Rivertown knows that the Longxuan Restaurant will be opening soon. Given the market responses, many people will turn up in their restaurant on the first day. How should we deal with this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Make sure the things are ready!\u201dWang Xian did not answer his question directly as he looked at the entrance with a smiling face.These few days, Wang Xian got Manager Huang to prepare a few showcase boxes like those that could be seen in the market.However, the showcase boxes that came with frozen storage were much more high class and exquisite.The four showcase boxes were located on both sides of the entrance while a huge aquarium was situated in the center. However, there was no ornamental fish in the aquarium.\u201cIt\u2019s done. Director Wang. Look at all the imported equipment. They neither obstruct the visual nor the passageway,\u201d said Manager Huang, frowning.\u201cShuqing, have you printed out all our promotions?\u201d Wang Xian asked with a smile.\u201cYes, they are done.

With such a substantial investment in marketing, the results were visible. Some passers-by even made enquiries in the daytime today.At three in the afternoon, an old man, together with six young men, walked in.

After all, addressing him as \u2018Dragon King\u2019 was way too high-profile.And \u2018Wang\u2019 (aka \u2018the King\u2019) seemed like a shorter nickname Wang Xian.\u201cBring the things over!\u201d Wang Xian stood up and said.Guan Shuqing, Manager Huang, and the rest of the chefs did not rest.

They opened the box, revealing a fish in it.The body size of the fish was about three meters long. It was beefy and sleek, flickering with silvery radiance.\u201cAtlantic Bluefin Marlin. It\u2019s the Atlantic Bluefin Marlin!\u201d\u201cGosh! It\u2019s an Atlantic Bluefin Marlin of at least 400 catties!\u201d\u201cSuch a huge and beautiful Atlantic Bluefin Marlin.

Gosh!\u201d Manager Huang exclaimed dumbfoundedly.With these two top-graded fish, would the First-grade Restaurant be afraid of the Longxuan Restaurant?

Gosh, the abalones are huge!\u201dJust as everyone was staring at the Atlantic Bluefin Marlin and the Chinese Bahaba fish, the abalones were unloaded one by one.Among which, a few of the palm-sized abalones drew surprising cries from the chef.The chef pointed unbelievably at those abalones that were taken out from the box with eyes agape.\u201cThis\u2026 One-headed abalone.

Definitely the ultimate top-graded arowanas.Manager Huang stared unbelievably at those arowanas with eyes agape.He was not an expert in arowana, but his ex-boss borrowed several arowanas some time ago. Those arowanas were said to be worth more than a million each.But he was sure that those arowanas back then were far inferior to these arowanas here.The nine arowanas were sweeping its body from left to right in the aquarium. Its domineering mightiness was fascinating!\u201cJust these arowanas would cost more than $10 millions of dollars? Manager Huang was a little stupefied.Lastly, hundreds of lobsters were taken out, relieving the group of people who were still stunned.Luckily, the last hundred lobsters were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars which were incomparable to the rest of the fish.\u201cAn Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish, two one-headed abalones, ten two-headed abalones\u2026 Bring out those Wild Giant Yellow Croaker which I caught some time ago, and put them in the showcase.\u201dWang Xian looked at a chef impassively.\u201cYes, Boss.

As long as you eat in our restaurant today, we will be giving you a serving for free.\u201d\u201cWow, what a big fish!\u2019\u201cGrouper! The price of grouper isn\u2019t cheap. It\u2019s over $100 per catty!\u201d\u201cThis grouper is really huge! Doesn\u2019t this mean that this alone is worth $30,000 to $40,000? Longxuan Restaurant is really generous to give it out for free!\u201d\u201cRich! This Longxuan Restaurant is simply rich! Disregarding the publicity over the last few days, one could easily tell its strength by its ability to invite Lin Qingying over. Moreover, the range of top-quality seafood is really wide here!\u201dSome people looked at that huge grouper in awe. How extravagant! Awesome!The lips of Director Xie curved into a smile and he was very satisfied with the reactions of the crowd. He smiled faintly at the people below the platform who were busy taking photos with their mobile phones.However, there was a batch of people who were surprisingly not shocked. On the contrary, they were commenting softly, \u201cIt\u2019s just a grouper! This is a far cry from First-grade Restaurant!\u201d\u201cYeah. Is this all they got? Why does it feel that they are miles behind First-grade Restaurant? Yet they dare to claim to be far ahead of First-grade Restaurant!\u201dThis group of people was puzzled while looking at Director Xie acting cocky on the platform.\u201cBoss, is everything going at 50% of its original price?\u201d A voice of a middle-aged man sounded suddenly. The crowd looked towards Director Xie and was waiting for his reply.\u201cEverything in our restaurant is going at 50% of the original price. This includes the drinks.\u201d Director Xie smiled. However, he quickly added, \u201cNaturally, some stuff couldn\u2019t possibly be going at 50%. For example, the two-headed abalone. We have spent a lot of effort to get them from Australia and therefore these will be sold at the original price of $450,000. Besides that, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin and caviar will also not be at 50%. I believe everyone knows the prices of these.\u201d\u201cHowever!\u201d Director Xie\u2019s face was still brimming with confidence. \u201cOur Australian Lobsters and King Crab will be going at 50%. Just think about being able to have these for slightly over $1,000 when one typically costs $2,000-$3,000! Isn\u2019t this great!\u201d\u201cOur Longxuan Restaurant is really extravagant and generous. The price of a meal would be just $5,000 if it costs $10,000 initially. This is a once in a blue moon opportunity! Moreover, our promotional activities will only be for today and over the next few days. Today, we have the highest discount of 50%.\u201d The manager added from the side.\u201cThat\u2019s a really good deal!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect deal! Even Australian Lobsters and King Crab are going for half price. This is simply too cheap.\u201d\u201cLongxuan Restaurant is taking a loss with each sale! Awesome, awesome!\u201dThe crowd couldn\u2019t contain their surprise as they exclaimed.Director Xie had also invited some members of the media to record this event. They were taking photos constantly to prepare for future publications.They had already thought of the headlines. For example, \u201cExtravagant Longxuan Restaurant! Everything at just 50% on the opening day! Top-quality seafood waiting for you to enjoy!\u201d\u201cThe most extravagant restaurant! The most luxurious restaurant! The most delicious restaurant! Top-quality restaurant awaits your arrival!\u201dHowever, there was a group of people looking at Director Xie and the manager with a weird expression.A middle-aged man couldn\u2019t contain himself and remarked loudly, \u201cPlease pardon me for my honest words! If this is all you have, I\u2019m afraid Longxuan Restaurant has a long way to go to overtake First-grade Restaurant!\u201d\u201cYeah. To exclude Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, two-headed abalone and other top-tier ingredients from discounts, you guys are miles behind First-grade Restaurant!\u201d\u201cYeah. First-grade Restaurant is also having a promotional event today and all the ingredients in the restaurant are going at half price. Even a one-headed abalone is at half price. Think about it! A $2 million one-headed abalone going at half price!\u201d\u201cI thought Longxuan Restaurant would be generous. What a huge discrepancy from expectation!\u201dWhen the middle-aged man spoke, those customers that were waiting for First-grade Restaurant\u2019s opening couldn\u2019t hold back anymore and seconded.After five to six people had spoken, the crowd was stunned.Director Xie was also taken aback and looked sternly at those people. \u201cYou guys are probably hired by First-grade Restaurant to cause trouble here! With First-grade Restaurant\u2019s capabilities, there\u2019s no way it has the strength to compete with Longxuan Restaurant. We are at least two tiers ahead!\u201dDirector Xie\u2019s words angered those people. We were hired? They naturally wouldn\u2019t be happy about being accused of being something that they weren\u2019t!\u201cWe are hired? What a joke! We are just regular customers and would go to wherever has the most delicious food and widest range of top-quality ingredients. We are just speaking the truth!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I really wonder where you find the courage to say that you guys are two tiers above First-grade Restaurant. You guys should take a look at others before saying that.\u201d\u201cIgnorance! It\u2019s you guys who are inferior by several tiers as compared to First-grade Restaurant and have to rely on a large amount of publicity to gain reputation. You guys should have checked out the difference between Longxuan Restaurant and First-grade Restaurant!\u201dThe customers below the platform grumbled angrily. Since they were accused of being hired, they wouldn\u2019t have to be courteous with Longxuan Restaurant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWho would have expected that First-grade Restaurant would send these troublemakers. What a despicable group of people. Security! Throw these people out.\u201d A young man from below the stage was outraged upon seeing the few middle-aged men shouting.\u201cInteresting! Interesting! We are just speaking the truth. How do you even dare to be so presumptuous in claiming First-grade Restaurant is inferior to you when you haven\u2019t even recognized the true strength of First-grade Restaurant!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just going to say this and it isn\u2019t because I\u2019m biased towards First-grade Restaurant. In my opinion, Longxuan Restaurant is just thrash as compared to First-grade Restaurant!\u201d\u201cYou guys are just thrash!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He darkened his expression as soon as he heard the comments on the stage.\u201cI don\u2019t need you to chase us off. We\u2019ll walk out ourselves. In any case, the First-grade Restaurant is going to open soon!\u201dA middle-aged man spoke to Director Xie coldly as he walked towards the First-grade Restaurant.\u201cYou\u2019ll find out who is the best when you walk into the restaurant. How dare you claim yourself as the most generous and luxurious restaurant. Heh, you\u2019re far from that!\u201d\u201cSigh, I can\u2019t even bear to look anymore. The top-graded ingredients of the First-grade Restaurant were shared frantically on the Wechat feed. 50% off everything in the shop. Even the One-headed Abalone that is worth 2 million is selling at half price. They even have ten Two-headed Abalones.\u201dSome people commented while shaking their heads. They left the place and headed to the First-grade Restaurant.About 80 people left the place with disdainful expressions on their faces as they commented.Some of the people around were stunned as they had no idea about it. They knew nothing about the top-graded seafood of First-grade Restaurant and the half-priced promotion.After all, someone had only spotted the top-graded seafood of First-grade Restaurant last night. Despite how fast it was propagated on the feed, many people remained unaware of it.The surrounding people were somewhat stunned as they watched the group of people departing.Just then, the door of the First-grade Restaurant was opened. Subsequently, they took out their advertising signboards and set them up in front of the door.\u201c50% off everything including One-headed Abalone, Two-headed Abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish, and even the Wild Giant Yellow Croakers! 50% off everything!\u201dA simple advertising signboard with pictures of abalones, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish, and Wild Giant Yellow Croakers.\u201cFinally, they are opened.

This is way too awesome!\u201dThose people who left were excited as they ran off hastily when the First-grade Restaurant opened their doors for business.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we check it out too?!\u201d those people in front of the Longxuan Restaurant asked hesitantly when they saw the crowd streaming towards the First-grade Restaurant.\u201cI\u2019ll check it out to see if what they said was real!\u201d\u201cMe too. It should not be possible for the First-grade Restaurant to find about 90 people just to act as shills. If what they said was untrue, then they would be smearing their own brand name!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019ll check them out too!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see if it is really as awesome as they claimed it would be!\u201dSome of the people popped over to the First-grade Restaurant while some people were prepared to sit around and observe.For a moment, no one entered the Longxuan Restaurant. On the stage, Director Xie turned sulky as he held his microphone tightly with killing radiance flickering in his eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t push, everyone. Line up orderly.\u201dManager Huang was excited to see the influx of customers at the restaurant entrance.\u201cSorry, we\u2019re really sorry. We\u2019re still in the midst of preparation. So, if you want to have your meals, you might need to wait for more than an hour. You can wait if you\u2019re patient enough!\u201dManager Huang yelled at the top of his lungs. His chin was slightly lifted as he was feeling proud.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at these displays in front of us. Check out the One-headed Abalone and the Chinese Bahaba fish.\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s check these out first. Damm, I have never seen One-headed Abalone. Not even a Chinese Bahaba fish.\u201d\u201cManager Huang, even the One-headed Abalone that cost more than 2 million\u2026it is also at half price? If someone buys this, won\u2019t the shop be losing money?\u201d the group of people asked curiously as they marched in.\u201c50% off for everything. This is not empty talk. But all our seafood has to be cooked in the restaurant after purchase to prevent people from reselling our One-headed Abalones,\u201d Manager Huang answered in a loud voice.\u201cGosh! It\u2019s true. This is a god-like promotion. A One-headed Abalone at half price means we save over a million dollars!\u201d\u201cWow, they are really Chinese Bahaba fish, Wild Giant Yellow Croakers, two One-headed Abalone, and 10 Two-headed Abalone.

Are they really that expensive?\u201d\u201cOf course. My friend sells ornamental fish. So, I know something about it. These arowanas looked really impressive. They are worth at least a million!\u201d\u201cGosh! Then all this seafood and the ornamental fishes would add up to a value of 20 to 30 million. I heard that First-grade Restaurant is owned by someone else now. Is the current boss that wealthy?\u201d\u201cPeople in front, please wait inside after viewing. Give the people at the back a chance!\u201d the customers who were waiting behind said in anticipation as they heard the exclamations from the customers in front.\u201cNo hurry, no hurry!\u201d the people in the front answered.\u201cThe people queuing behind are blocking the road. Can the people in front hurry up?!\u201dThe crowd was overwhelming. Some of them entered slowly as they revealed shocked expressions while gazing at the top-graded seafood.

The grouper is a joke in front of all these top-graded seafoods!\u201d\u201cThe people in the Longxuan Restaurant are idiots. How could they have the cheek to say the First-grade Restaurant is incomparable to them. It should be the other way around. The two of them are not of the same class. How dare they claim to be generous? They are a disgrace in front of the First-grade Restaurant!\u201d\u201cYes, I don\u2019t understand how they have the guts to make such proclamations.

It was especially so in the vicinity of First-grade Restaurant.Just a while ago, all the traffic was gathered at the well-decorated entrance of Longxuan Restaurant. However, at this very moment, it looked a little deserted.\u201cThis is crazy. This is crazy! First-grade Restaurant is full right now. I couldn\u2019t even squeeze in if I wished.\u201d\u201cI was still thinking of going to take a look at the one-headed abalone. I have never seen a one-headed abalone in my life.\u201d\u201cOne-headed Abalone, two-headed abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish, Yellow Croaker Fish and several precious ornamental arowana! First-grade Restaurant\u2019s promotional activity is truly shocking.\u201d\u201cFirst-grade Restaurant truly deserves its name. However, Longxuan Restaurant is in an embarrassing situation now. They have been publicizing fervently and even invited a star over. During the opening speech, they even claimed to be much better than First-grade Restaurant. This is simply a slap to their own face!\u201d\u201cYeah, a slap to their own face. Longxuan Restaurant publicized that everything is going at half price but exclude two-headed abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin and some top-quality ingredients. However, everything is going at half price at First-grade Restaurant. First-grade Restaurant is clearly to take a loss with each sale!\u201d\u201cThis is a contest between First-grade Restaurant and Longxuan Restaurant but it seems like Longxuan Restaurant has been handed a complete defeat!\u201dAt the entrance of Longxuan Restaurant, some customers took a glance at Longxuan Restaurant. They shook their heads and walked towards First-grade Restaurant just a short distance away.Director Xie was shivering in anger while standing by the side and hearing their conversation. He gritted his teeth and clenched his fist tightly.Defeat. Utter defeat!!From the beginning to the end, the boss of First-grade Restaurant had never shown his face. And from the beginning to the end, First-grade Restaurant had never done any publicity.Relying on just strength, First-grade restaurant had completely rolled over Longxuan Restaurant.\u201cHow can this be possible? How did he get his hands on such precious seafood!\u201dDirector Xie\u2019s eyes were filled with disbelief.He thought that he was already great to be able to get two-headed abalone and Atlantic Bluefin Marlin. However, just a simple comparison and it was clear that he was far from it.\u201cDirector Xie, we\u2026 We\u2026\u201d The middle-aged manager of Longxuan Restaurant walked out and stammered with sorrow.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Director Xie turned his head over and stared at the middle-aged man with murderous intent. \u201cDidn\u2019t I ask you to investigate the background of the boss of First-grade Restaurant? Didn\u2019t I ask you to keep a lookout of their actions? These are the results of your investigation?\u201d\u201cDirector Xie, this really isn\u2019t my fault. I had not expected this either. They only brought out these ingredients last night. At that time, we were having the celebratory feast!\u201d the manager said righteously.Celebratory feast!When Director Xie heard these words, it felt full of mockery. Celebratory feast? A celebratory feast for this darn outcome?\u201cBrother, what should we do?\u201d the young man from the side walked over and asked Director Xie with a face of sorrows.\u201cAfter investing close to $20 million, we can\u2019t just let it be!\u201d Director Xie clenched his fist tightly as a violent look flashed past his eyes.The young man was taken aback but soon revealed the same expression. \u201cBrother, I also feel that we shouldn\u2019t just let this go. brother-in-law\u2019s strength could be considered really strong in Rivertown. Should we look for him?\u201dDirector Xie took out a cigarette and lit it. \u201cI\u2019ll go make a call.\u201d\u201cLongxuan Restaurant will operate as planned. The victory of this showdown will belong to us.\u201dDirector Xie sneered at the people around and headed directly to the office in Longxuan Restaurant.The surrounding members of the media and publicity personnel took a look at Longxuan Restaurant before looking at First-grade Restaurant just a short distance away. Suddenly, they were lost as to how to write their articles.Lin Qingying also looked inquisitively at First-grade Restaurant and her eyes were shimmering.\u201cBoss, we have succeeded. There\u2019re barely any customers at Longxuan Restaurant and we have a full house right here. There\u2019re still a lot of people waiting to come in to take a look!\u201dAt this moment, Manager Huang spoke excitedly to Wang Xian within the office in First-grade Restaurant.\u201cAs expected!\u201dWang Xian\u2019s lips curved slowly into a smile. \u201cSince we have started the activity today, we better do it well. This will be tough on the employees. Get something good for lunch!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not tough. It\u2019s not tough. After this incident, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for Longxuan Restaurant to get up again. On the contrary, with the seafood that boss had brought over, our business would only get better and better!\u201d Manager Huang said joyously.\u201cDefinitely! Oh right, Manager Huang. Reserve a private lounge for me tonight. I\u2019ll like to invite some friends over for dinner.\u201d Wang Xian said to Manager Huang.\u201cAlright, Director Wang.\u201d Manager Huang nodded his head.\u201cXiao Xian, you are really awesome.\u201d The moment Manager Huang left, Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian with total respect.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s a given.\u201d Wang Xian smiled satisfactorily.It was a little beyond his expectations to be able to win this showdown so easily.Although he brought over quite a substantial amount of top-quality ingredients from the ocean the last few days and Longxuan Restaurant was miles away from First-grade restaurant, Longxuan Restaurant shouldn\u2019t have been defeated so utterly.However, their mistakes were on the discounts given and that they were too petty about the discounts.First-grade Restaurant was also providing 50% off like Longxuan Restaurant. However, First-grade Restaurant\u2019s 50% discount was on all ingredients.As for Longxuan Restaurant\u2019s 50% discount, it did not include those top-quality ingredients. Besides that, they were still emphasizing how extravagant they were at their opening ceremony. In the end, this became a tight slap on their own faces.Comparing would only reveal one\u2019s shortcomings.If Longxuan Restaurant did not compare themselves with First-grade Restaurant, they were indeed really awesome.However, in a simple comparison, the difference between them was stark.Even Wang Xian had not expected that the arrogant Director Xie would be such a scrooge.However, Wang Xian was able to do so because these top-quality ingredients did not cost him anything as he caught them from the seas. However, Director Xie had to spend real cash to purchase his ingredients!Wang Xian lied on the chair leisurely and was smiling as he witnessed the rise of First-grade Restaurant.What happened on Old street today was soon spread to the majority of Rivertown.Many group chats, Weibo, chat groups and forums were discussing First-grade Restaurant.The reputation of First-grade Restaurant had also quickly spread to other cities as it became sensational over the internet.In this era, a Chinese Bahaba fish would be enough to make the headlines, let alone a restaurant in possession of such a range of top-quality ingredients.As for Longxuan Restaurant who had been publicizing fervently over the past few days, they had now become the joke.A showdown ended with Longxuan Restaurant\u2019s complete defeat!Late at night, some media houses who caught the news carried their cameras over to First-grade Restaurant to visit the hottest restaurant in Rivertown.Wang Xian saw it from his office. After which, he sent Manager Huang over to receive them.When it came to interviews from the media, Wang Xian was still very willing to accept them. This was a very good way to achieve publicity.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLet\u2019s go and try the food of First-grade Restaurant.

Many people were also queuing in the waiting area near the entrance.Many customers were gazing at the expensive world-class seafood.When Lin Qingying walked into the restaurant, her brows slightly knit together as she looked inside.The people were overwhelming such that the restaurant seemed overcrowded.However, it was normal since the First-grade Restaurant was too famous.Lin Qingying raised an eyebrow as she looked at the front desk staff. She asked the staff over at the counter, \u201cAre there any seats available?\u201d\u201cNope. You can take a queue number.

She was the renowned food celebrity who had taken part in the opening ceremony of Longxuan Restaurant this morning.\u201cCan we?\u201d Lin Qingying raised her eyebrows slightly as she continued asking Wang Xian.\u201cHow many people are there in the queue?\u201d Wang Xian did not answer her. Instead, he asked the staff at the side.\u201cDirector Wang, there are 25 more people in the queue!\u201d The staff replied.\u201c25?\u201d Wang Xian nodded and turned to the sexy Lin Qingying. Regretfully, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss Lin Qingying. There are 25 tables in front of you. I\u2019m afraid today is not possible. Please come early tomorrow!\u201dWang Xian had stunned Lin Qingying with his statement as she looked at him with disbelief.Lin Qingying was not expecting such an answer from the other party. She was a celebrity\u2013a food celebrity. Her presence in any restaurant would be its best publicity.Yet, this young man had turned her down flat.This was embarrassing to her. She looked at Wang Xian with radiance flickering in her eyes, \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201dThe question posed by Lin Qingying stunned Wang Xian. He chuckled and replied immediately, \u201cWhat has that got to do with it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wang Xian\u2019s reply infuriated her, \u201cYou actually reject me from dining in here?\u201dLin Qingying looked at Wang Xian with a dirty look.In the past, all the managers or bosses would deliver their dishes personally wherever she had her meals. All of them were hoping to receive good reviews from her. If she could post their restaurant on her Weibo, that would be even better.Yet, the First-grade Restaurant had the cheek to ask her to return tomorrow. This boiled the blood of the prideful girl.\u201cThis beautiful lady over here has a funny way of talking, I guess? The restaurant is full now. If you want to have your food here, you can wait.

Subsequently, he walked to the front desk, ignoring her.Lin Qingying was infuriated, as her anger was written all over her face after hearing what Wang Xian said.Some of the customers who were waiting spotted the commotion. When they saw Lin Qingying, all of them had a surprised look on their faces.When they overheard the conversations between Lin Qingying and the boss, they were stupefied.\u201cThe boss is really superb.

With such capability, you need to queue for their food even if you\u2019re a food celebrity!\u201dSome customers praised Wang Xian for the way he dealt with the situation while some looked at him with a sneer.There were several media members, not far away from them, who recorded down the scene with excitement on their faces.They were not expecting to meet Lin Qingying when they were only here for the coverage of the First-grade Restaurant.The news was simply too juicy. They already thought of ways to publicize it.Headlines:\u201cBreaking news! Lin Qingying was told to wait in the queue by the boss when she was here for the food. Even celebrities need to queue. No privilege!\u201dOr\u2026\u201cShocking! The First-grade Restaurant is so capable that they do not need the celebrities\u2019 promotion. So what if you are Lin Qingying, queue up!\u201dLin Qingying had a complicated facial expression when she heard the surrounding comments.\u201cQingying, let\u2019s leave this place. The media are here too,\u201d the assistant next to her said to her anxiously when she noticed the media snapping photos of them.Lin Qingying took a deep breath. She put on her sunglasses and walked out, embarrassed.Wang Xian lifted his head. As Lin Qingying departed, he had a faint disdainful look on his face.So what if you are a star? Longxuan Restaurant might need publicity, but not First-grade Restaurant.\u2026One by one, Wang Xian\u2019s friends turned up at about 7 o\u2019clock in the evening.Old Qin brought along his wife, Qin Lianhui, as well as Little Kite. Four members from Old Xue\u2019s family, including Xue Jing\u2019s mother, were here. Lan Qingyue showed up too.When Wang Xian had invited them over for a meal, both Old Xue and Old Qin agreed without any hesitation.Guan Shuqing came over happily too.\u201cToday, I would like to invite everyone to have a taste of the food in the First-grade Restaurant.\u201dWang Xian beamed at everyone as the dishes were brought to the table.Looking at the dishes that were worth over a million on the table, Old Xue exclaimed, \u201cTsk tsk, Buddy Wang Xian, you\u2019re too generous. Two-headed Abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin sashimi, Wild Giant Yellow Croakers, and Chinese Bahaba fish\u2019s gelatine soup. This is too extravagant!\u201d\u201cThis is the first time in my life to have such extravagant dishes. All thanks to Buddy Wang Xian,\u201d Old Qin laughed out loud as he said to Wang Xian.\u201cI have to bring out the best when I\u2019m hosting my friends. If not, that would be too stingy of me,\u201d Wang Xian chuckled. \u201cThe fish gelatine of the Chinese Bahaba fish is good for the ladies. It enhances the beauty and enriches the blood flow.\u201d\u201cXiao Xian, you\u2019re sincere in buying us a meal!\u201d Lan Qingyue, who was sitting on the left of Wang Xian, laughed as she said.\u201cHehe, it\u2019s half price today. I don\u2019t feel bad with some orders!\u201d Wang Xian joked while Guan Shuqing on his right smiled.\u201cBuddy Wang Xian and the two beauties over here, let\u2019s have a toast. In the future, you can look for me if you need any help. The Qin Family will definitely help you out.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThank you, Grandpa Qin!\u201d Both Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue quickly raised their glasses.Wang Xian and the rest of the people finished their drinks in a gulp. The Xue Family and the Qin Family were great friends.It was only courteous to reciprocate their friendship. Wang Xian bought them a meal to strengthen their bond.On the other hand, the two influential families, Qin and Xue Families, were very happy to befriend Wang Xian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wang Xian was surprised to see two beautiful girls still around after sending off Old Qin and Old Xue.\u201cAre you not going home too?\u201d Wang Xian gave a gentle smile and asked Lan Qingyue.Wang Xian wasn\u2019t very familiar with Lan Qingyue. The number of times they had met and chat could be counted with a single hand.Nonetheless, his impression of Lan Qingyue was still very good. It was especially so after the incident at the banquet. With regard to this cold-looking girl, he did have some good feelings for her.However, such feelings hadn\u2019t reached the level he had for Guan Shuqing.\u201cIt\u2019s late now. I\u2019ll probably head back to the dormitory to sleep.\u201d Lan Qingyue smiled, looking to Guan Shuqing before asking Wang Xian, \u201cAre you heading back to the dormitory too?\u201d\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t possibly be sleeping in the restaurant.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and turned to Guan Shuqing. \u201cLet\u2019s go, it\u2019s pretty late now. Let\u2019s head back!\u201d\u201cAlright! In that case, let\u2019s walk back. Your motorcycle is unlikely to fit three people!\u201d Guan Shuqing joked.\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d Wang Xian replied with a smile. This darned heavy-duty motorcycle had problems fetching an additional person, let alone ferrying two people.\u201cLet\u2019s walk back together!\u201d suggested Wang Xian.\u201cSure. I\u2019m feeling so full from the dinner. Walking back can help in the digestion.\u201d Guan Shuqing nodded her head.Lan Qingyue felt a little uncomfortable listening to the conversation between the two of them from the side. Nonetheless, she squeezed out a smile on her face. \u201cThe night skies are really beautiful today. Let\u2019s walk back together. I wonder if the people from the school would kill you with their gazes if they saw you walking with two beautiful girls!\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s true. You two are well-known beauties of our school and considered as goddess-like existences! I\u2019ll probably walk slower on our way back in a while!\u201d Wang Xian chuckled.Lan Qingyue was to his left in a black dress and had the disposition of a cold-looking goddess. Guan Shuqing was to his right and had a faint smile on her. She had the disposition of a cute and adorable goddess.Both of them were very tall because of their fine family backgrounds and were considered by many as goddesses.Guan Shuqing rolled her eyes at Wang Xian before commenting, \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. Thank you, boss, for treating us to such a great dinner today!\u201d\u201cYeah, Xiao Xian. If there\u2019s something so delicious in the future, don\u2019t forget to call me along.\u201d Lan Qingyue added in a hurry.\u201cSure, that\u2019s not a problem. If there\u2019s anything delicious in the future, I\u2019ll call you along.\u201d Wang Xian walked between the two beautiful girls and could smell two different fragrances. This made his face light up with impish glee!\u201cXiao Xian, I really have to thank you for this. Because of you, our Lan Family has gotten closer to Qin Family.\u201d\u201cOh yeah! Xiao Xian, my father has been thinking of apologizing to you for that incident. He would like to ask you out for dinner but I told him that you aren\u2019t free\u2026\u201dAlong the way, Wang Xian realized that Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue had many things to talk about. All he could do was to nod his head in approval while listening.They started from their families to interesting incidents that happened in school. Throughout the journey, it was an enjoyable experience for all of them.After sending the two girls to the girl\u2019s dormitory, Wang Xian waved and bade goodbye to the two of them.\u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d Guan Shuqing looked to Wang Xian and waved back.\u201cSure!\u201dWang Xian nodded his head and waved at them before heading back to his dormitory.Looking at the back view of Wang Xian, Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing suddenly quietened down. A unique atmosphere started forming around them.\u201cJunior, I wouldn\u2019t just give up.\u201d Suddenly, Lan Qingyue broke the silence. She flicked her long and silky hair and exhibited a strong sense of confidence.\u201cI have more interactions with him and that\u2019s an advantage!\u201d Guan Shuqing smiled radiantly and said to Lan Qingyue. She was also exhibiting the same confident disposition.\u201cFair competition!\u201d Lan Qingyue looked at Guan Shuqing before walking up the stairs.Looking at her back view, Guan Shuqing suddenly had a bitter feeling. She mumbled, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m confident, my mum said that all men would eat from their bowl but stare at what\u2019s inside the pot. It is especially so when there\u2019s such a tasty piece of meat in the pot\u2026\u201dWang Xian didn\u2019t know about the conversation between the two girls after he left.When he got back into the dormitory, he took a shower and stretched his back.It had been extremely tiring for him over the last few days as he was actively looking for Chinese Bahaba fish and Atlantic Bluefin Marlin.However, just as he was about to get into bed, his expression changed.\u201cDamn it. Disturbing my rest.\u201dWang Xian immediately put on his clothes, walked out of his dormitory and ran quickly towards First-grade Restaurant.In the wee hours of the day, he moved like a phantom. If one simply used his naked eyes, all he could see was a black figure flashing past him.\u201cBrother-in-law, would there be a problem if we burned down his restaurant!\u201dAt the entrance of Old street, a luxurious Bentley was parked at the left side of the road.Within the car, a young man was sitting in the driver seat. Director Xie was sitting beside the driver seat and a young man was sitting in the back of the car.\u201cRest assured! A restaurant catching fire is just a small issue. Moreover, what can they possibly do even if they can find some traces?\u201d the young man in the driver seat said with indifference as he smoked.\u201cThank you, brother-in-law. If we didn\u2019t have you, I really wouldn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Director Xie was sitting beside and kept a very low profile.\u201cThis is just a small issue. Look for me if you encounter any issues in Rivertown. I\u2019ll settle it for you,\u201d the young man said nonchalantly as though burning down a famous restaurant was nothing in his eyes.\u201cBrother-in-law is from one of the top Ancient Martial Arts Family in Rivertown. We weren\u2019t intending to disturb you initially and wanted to invite you over for a meal. However, we encountered this troublesome incident.\u201d Director Xie smiled.\u201cHehe, it isn\u2019t too late if you invite me a few days from now. Come, let us enjoy the fireworks!\u201d The young man retracted the roof of the Bentley.\u201cFireworks, fireworks!\u201d The juvenile sitting in the backseat revealed an excited expression.Director Xie\u2019s lips curved slightly and gave a cold and faint smirk. He was already thinking of going to witness the despairing look on that brat the next day.Mess with me? You aren\u2019t qualified! Although Xie Family\u2019s influence isn\u2019t in Rivertown, I could still easily crush you!Director Xie took out a cigarette leisurely and waited patiently for the fireworks to start.Swoosh!However, they hadn\u2019t noticed a figure charging over from the side.Them?Wang Xian was still able to see the surroundings clearly while running. When his gaze swept passed the Bentley convertible at the road junction, he had a thought.Swoosh!In the blink of an eye, Wang Xian had appeared at the entrance of the restaurant.There wasn\u2019t anyone around Old Street in the wee hours of the day and all the shops were closed. At the location of First-grade Restaurant, two figures were lying down on the floor.\u201cDragon King, these two people tried to burn down First-grade Restaurant.\u201dA burly old man stood at the entrance of First-grade Restaurant and he was none other than Mo Qinglong.With goods worth several tens of millions in First-grade Restaurant currently, Wang Xian naturally wouldn\u2019t feel safe. Therefore, he had arranged for Mo Qinglong to guard this place at night.As Mo Qinglong was his bloodline descendant, he could contact Wang Xian through a unique method within a three kilometer radius.\u201cMartial Artists?\u201d Wang Xian was surprised to see the two unconscious people on the ground.\u201cYes, Dragon King. Both of them are Level Five Martial Artists and could be considered to be quite strong!\u201d Mo Qinglong said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTwo martial artists?\u201d When Wang Xian recalled the luxurious Bentley convertible at the road junction previously, an image of a young man surfaced in his mind.\u201cWho would have expected you guys to employ such despicable means. In that case\u2026\u201dWang Xian\u2019s eyes flickered and looked away from First-grade Restaurant.\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll give you guys a firework show!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With a scoffing look on his face, he walked towards the old street.\u201cYes, Dragon King!\u201dMo Qinglong, with a pair of passionate eyes, nodded respectfully. With just an arm swing of the Dragon King just now, the place was engulfed by the blazing fire.Such formidable Superpower. Even if his cultivation attained the Inborn level, he could never duplicate that.Wang Xian enveloped the entire Longxuan Restaurant with his fire attribute. Soon, the restaurant was burning.\u201cThe fireworks are up. Haha, it\u2019s so beautiful!\u201dWhen the flames rose, the juvenile sitting in the Bentley sports car stood up as he watched the fireworks in the old street from a distance.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s beautiful!\u201d Director Xie had an intoxicated look on his face, \u201cHaha, First-grade Restaurant. How dare you fight with me. This is your end. Brother-in-law, thanks to you this time.\u201d\u201cNo big deal!\u201d The young man flicked the ash off his cigarette with a slacking face. This was a piece of cake for him.He did not care about burning down a restaurant.\u201cWhen that young man finds out that his restaurant has been turned into ashes tomorrow, he probably will hug himself and cry!\u201d The juvenile stared at the firework in the distance with excitement.\u201cThis is his end!\u201d Director Xie took a deep puff. Satisfying!\u201cYes, the fireworks are beautiful. Stunningly gorgeous!\u201dJust then, an unfamiliar voice was heard suddenly from the car.\u201cOf course\u2026\u201d When the juvenile heard this, he responded instinctively. But soon, he realized that something was amiss.The voice seemed to be coming from the seat next to him.But there should be no one beside him\u2026He spun his head around and revealed a shocking look in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2026You\u2026\u201dHe pointed at Wang Xian with an look of disbelief.\u201cWho are you?\u201dThe young man who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat sensed an oppressive danger instantly. He stood up immediately and looked at Wang Xian with disbelief. He then swept his gaze across Mo Qinglong, who was standing next to the car.He had not sensed anyone near him.\u201cMe?\u201d Wang Xian revealed a playful expression when he saw the young man staring at him, shocked. \u201cLet them introduce me!\u201d\u201cHow\u2026 How did you come in?\u201d Director Xie was also stunned when he turned around and saw Wang Xian in the car.\u201cHey, don\u2019t be panicked. Look at the fireworks. They\u2019re so beautiful!\u201dWang Xian looked at the distant fireworks with a smile.\u201cThat place\u2026 No\u2026 That is\u2026\u201d Director Xie noticed his composure, so he turned around to look carefully again. Subsequently, his body trembled as he spun and stared at Wang Xian with his blood-shot eyes. \u201cHow dare you burn down my Longxuan Restaurant\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Longxuan Restaurant is the one on fire?\u201d The juvenile was shocked, with mixed expressions on his face. \u201cBrother-in-law, kill him. Kill him! How dare he\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d At this time, Ren Anzhi stared at Wang Xian and Mo Qinglong with wariness on his face. When he heard the juvenile\u2019s voice, he yelled at him in a cold voice.Immediately, the juvenile shut up upon hearing him. But he glared furiously at Wang Xian.\u201cYes, that\u2019s the Longxuan Restaurant. Look, now it has turned into fireworks. How beautiful!\u201dWang Xian looked into the distance with a beaming face.\u201cWhich family or sect are you from?\u201d asked Ren Anzhi with a cold face. He did not dare to make any reckless moves as he could sense significant threats from them!\u201cWhich family are you from then?\u201d Wang Xian turned around and looked at him with smiles on his face when he heard Ren Anzhi\u2019s question.\u201cRen Family in Rivertown!\u201d Ren Anzhi said emotionlessly.\u201cOh, Ren Family; ranked second in the Ancient Martial Artist Families of Rivertown. Quite a formidable family!\u201dWang Xian drew his lips slightly when he listened to him. From Old Xue, he had already found out the rankings of the families in Rivertown. Ren Family was in second place.The strongest Martial Artist was a Level-eight elder in the Ren Family. Together with another two Level-seven Martial Artists, they made a powerful team.But to him, they were nothing if he just flicked his finger.\u201cWell, that\u2019s the end of the fireworks.

With a cold face, he said, \u201cLet me tell you this.

Without any additional movements, he grabbed Ren Anzhi\u2019s fist with no difficulties.\u201cOh no!\u201d Ren Anzhi was horrified, with eyes full of disbelief.He was a Level-five expert!\u201cRen Family? Regardless of which family you\u2019re from, you\u2019ll need to pay a hefty price for provoking the Dragon King!\u201d Mo Qinglong said impassively.With a pair of fearful eyes, Ren Anzhi felt a powerful stream of Internal Energy gushing towards his Elixir Field.Ka Ka Ka!Sounds of cracks were heard, Ren Anzhi could not help but spit a mouthful of blood.

After the fire was put out, the insides of Longxuan Restaurant were blackened and charred. Everything had been destroyed in the fire.\u201cBoss, we are famous! We are famous!\u201dThe next morning, just as Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing arrived at First-grade Restaurant, Manager Huang exclaimed in excitement. He passed the newspaper over and continued, \u201cBoss, take a look! This is the morning paper of Rivertown. Our First-grade Restaurant is now known throughout the town! Moreover, Longxuan Restaurant is completely finished after they caught fire last night. They are unlikely to reopen in the future.\u201d\u201cI already know about it.\u201dWang Xian smiled. \u201cWe might be getting a little busier for the next few days and will have to trouble Manager Huang to supervise the situation.\u201d\u201cNot a problem, not a problem.\u201d Manager Huang smiled as he shook his head.Wang Xian nodded his head and went into the office. With nothing to do, he switched on his computer and started playing.As a boss, he could do as he wished. Now that First-grade Restaurant had started off well, he could just come over to play games.Eh? First-grade Restaurant is in the headlines!Wang Xian clicked on a news article and had a radiant smile as he read about the introduction of First-grade Restaurant.The article was titled, \u201cAlthough I Was Surprised, I\u2019m Not Exaggerating\u201dWhen Wang Xian looked through the contents of that article, he smiled. After which, he continued browsing the Internet and saw several news articles reporting about them. Among them, there were also articles from large media houses.One of the news articles was about Lin Qingying and First-grade Restaurant.In that article, it was mentioned that Lin Qingying came to First-grade Restaurant for a meal. She tried to use her fame and reputation of a food blogger to ask the boss to arrange a table for her. However, she was asked to wait by the boss directly. Even stars wouldn\u2019t receive special treatment.There were lots of comments under the news article. Among which, the most popular one was:\u201cFirst-grade Restaurant is incredible!\u201dIn a food magazine, First-grade Restaurant was promoted as the most incredible, most extravagant and most luxurious restaurant.The three \u201cmost\u2019s\u201d clearly showed the strength of First-grade Restaurant.Within a single day, First-grade Restaurant was known throughout the country. There were even many customers from other cities who wished to head to First-grade Restaurant to try out their food and take a look at the most incredible restaurant in the country.Amongst the media reports from Rivertown, there was also an assessment of the showdown between Longxuan Restaurant and First-grade Restaurant.The gist of the content was that First-grade Restaurant completely ran over Longxuan Restaurant.There were even videos of Lin Qingying being rejected directly by the boss circulating on the Internet.Longxuan Restaurant was utterly defeated.Together with that fire at night, one could only pity Longxuan Restaurant.For the following days, the business of First-grade Restaurant exploded. People who came here for meals weren\u2019t just from Rivertown. Tourists in Rivertown would all come to First-grade Restaurant to try the food as long as they had the economic capacity to do so.Besides that, through some connections of Old Qin, First-grade Restaurant was placed in the introduction of Rivertown\u2019s tourist spots. Currently, First-grade Restaurant was classified as a \u201cmust-go\u201d restaurant for anyone who came to Rivertown.With the local authority\u2019s publicity, coupled with the reputation of First-grade Restaurant, First-grade Restaurant had a full house each day. Its sales had also doubled from before.Two-headed abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Wild Giant Yellow Croaker fish and Chinese Bahaba fish were all sold out.\u201cXiao Xian, these are the sales figures over the last few days. I have also calculated the profits. Do take a look.\u201dOn the fourth day, Guan Shuqing brought over the sales report to Wang Xian.Wang Xian took a look at it after receiving them from Guan Shuqing.First day sales: $770,000Second day sales: $830,000Third day sales: $970,000Fourth day sales: $102,000When Wang Xian saw these figures, excitement flashed in his eyes. These figures were really high and were several times as compared to before.However, from a different perspective, they weren\u2019t that high either. This was because they were achieved in a discounted period.Sales were $770,000 with 50% discount on the first day. Without discounts, it would be $1.54million.There were also 40% discounts on the second day, 30% discounts on the third day and 20% discounts on the fourth day.On the fourth day, sales had broken through the million-dollar mark. Moreover, with the current popularity of First-grade Restaurant, the sales figures of $1 million a day would likely last for some time.It was especially so during the festive days when sales might be even higher.If he was lucky to have a customer order 3 two-headed abalone in a day, that would be over $1 million. Moreover, these abalones, lobsters, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin and other variety of fish were all caught from the sea. There were no costs associated with them.Excluding the costs, I have earned approximately $2.5 million in four days!Wang Xian\u2019s lips curved into a smile. Although he was giving generous discounts over the last few days, he wasn\u2019t too concerned as there was no cost associated with the world-class ingredients.Based on this pace, he could earn more than $10 million in a month. Naturally, this had to be based on having a steady supply of world-class ingredients.Wang Xian\u2019s mind was thinking quickly and a smile appeared gradually. The issue with the supply of ingredients could be left to Roving Girl. With Roving Girl\u2019s current strength, catching some world-class seafood shouldn\u2019t be a problem at all.Bzz, bzz, bzz!At this moment, Wang Xian\u2019s phone rang suddenly. He took it up, took a look and a radiant smile appeared on his face.\u201cXiao Yu.\u201d\u201cBrother. I\u2019ll be going to the University of Rivertown with Xiao Mi and some other friends who got in too. At that time, come and fetch me.\u201dFrom the phone, the voice of his sister, Xiao Yu, sounded.\u201cWhat time are you arriving tomorrow?\u201d Wang Xian asked.Unknowingly, the semester of the university was about to start and his sister, Xiao Yu, would also be going to the same school as him.\u201cWe will be reaching Rivertown High-speed Rail Station tomorrow at 10am. At that time, you have to bring us around!\u201d\u201cRelax! I, your brother, guarantee to be there on time!\u201dAs he hung up the phone with a face of smiles, Wang Xian looked at today\u2019s date.The first-year students of the University of Rivertown had three days to report to the school. This was to ensure that students who were from a more distant place would have ample time.Xiao Yu and her friends were a little early and would be arriving a day in advance.There would also be a few other high school students who made it into the University of Rivertown. To be precise, there were eight of them.\u201cXiao Xian, your sister will be arriving tomorrow?\u201d Guan Shuqing overheard his phone conversation and asked inquisitively.\u201cYeah.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head. \u201cFor the following two days, I\u2019ll be bringing my sister around to have some fun. Therefore, I won\u2019t have time to come to the restaurant.\u201d\u201cIn that case, have a good time with Xiao Yu over the next two days. There\u2019re still three days to the official start of school after all,\u201d replied Guan Shuqing.\u201cYeah.\u201dWang Xian nodded his head and sank into his thoughts. He was thinking of giving her a huge surprise this time.The next morning, after finishing his breakfast, Wang Xian arrived at the High-speed Rail Station to wait for the arrival of his sisters.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt 10 am, a group of young guys and girls walked out from the High-speed rail station.There were eight of them, three girls and five boys.One of the girls was around 1.6 meters in height.

However, she had an exquisite face.She did not have any makeup on, looked very quiet and gave others the feeling of a \u201cgirl next door.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When Xiao Yu saw him, she was so thrilled that she dashed towards him.\u201cBrother!\u201dXiao Yu jumped onto Wang Xian. With an exhilarated face, she hugged his neck and called out happily.\u201cAlright, you\u2019re a big girl now. Why are you still so clingy?\u201dWang Xian patted her head and put her down.\u201cHehe.\u201d Xiao Yu chuckled as she got down from him. \u201cBrother, let me introduce you to our hometown friends who were admitted to University of Rivertown this year.\u201dXiao Yu smiled as she introduced the seven people who were walking over to Wang Xian.\u201cHello, Senior Wang Xian!\u201d A pleasant-looking girl greeted Wang Xian immediately.\u201cHi, Xiao Mi!\u201d Wang Xian nodded as he smiled at the girl. Xiao Mi was his sister\u2019s best friend, and her family was quite well-to-do. Hence, she often took care of Xiao Yu.\u201cHello, Senior!\u201d The rest of the people observed Wang Xian and greeted him.\u201cWhere are you guys heading to? The school doesn\u2019t provide accommodation today. So, you may need to stay outside for a night.\u201d Wang Xian looked at them. He then turned to Xiao Yu and asked, \u201cAre you hungry? Do you want to have something to eat?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. We\u2019re going to find a motel near the school and stay for a night. Then, we intend to tour around Rivertown during the next two days. Oh, where are we going now?\u201d asked Xiao Yu to the people behind her.\u201cLet\u2019s get some stuff today. We\u2019ll do our tour after we report to the school tomorrow.\u201d A juvenile with a sling bag asked, \u201cWe didn\u2019t bring many things with us, so, we need to get stuff like computers\u2026Senior Wang Xian, do you know where we can get them? It would be a lot of fun to play tomorrow if we settled our things today.\u201d\u201cYes. We can get our things today, and put them in our dormitory tomorrow. Senior, please take us to places where we can shop for our stuff!\u201d Another juvenile echoed in agreement.\u201cSure!\u201dWang Xian looked at them and nodded. He reached out for Xiao Yu\u2019s bag and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll have something simple in a restaurant, and I\u2019ll bring you guys to the city center to shop for your stuff.\u201d\u201cYes, Senior.\u201d The rest of them nodded their heads and headed outside.\u201cSenior, how\u2019s life at the university? Is it fun?\u201d a juvenile walked beside Wang Xian and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You will have some freedom since the school is not that strict.\u201d Wang Xian chuckled.\u201cSenior, you can take us to a better restaurant. I\u2019ll be buying lunch for all of us.\u201dAt this time, a juvenile spoke. He was dressed in trendy clothes with a pair of golden frame spectacles without any lenses. On his back, he carried a Hermes bag.As he spoke, he turned to look at Xiao Yu. \u201cXiao Yu, what would you like to eat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jia Wenrui. I\u2019ll eat anything!\u201d Sensing the attention of the juvenile, Xiao Yu shook her head with uneasiness.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll eat whatever you want,\u201d Jia Wenrui continued with a thick skin.\u201cAsk them what they want. I don\u2019t have any preference.\u201d Xiao Yu shook her head and looked at Wang Xian.Wang Xian smiled at her. He was not surprised when Xiao Yu had admirers. After all, his sister was pretty too.\u201cI want to have Japanese food. Let\u2019s have Japanese food, Wenrui.\u201d A girl walked beside Jia Wenrui and replied as she leaned closer to him.Jia Wenrui hesitated when he saw the tall and slim girl. She was a totally different kind of girl from Xiao Yu. She was tall with a height of 1.7 meters, and her figure was hot.She had a pretty face: sharp chin, tall nose, and a slim face.Even though she looked pretty, her face looked as though it was from a mold just like those online celebrities with plastic surgery faces.Moreover, the traces of plastic surgery were evident. She had makeup on her face with Chanel clothes and bag on her.She was a girl who came from a wealthy family.\u201cForget about having Japanese food in the afternoon. It\u2019s a waste of time. Besides, we\u2019ve got too many of us. It\u2019s a little troublesome.\u201dWang Xian suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s have something simple first, and I\u2019ll take you to seafood tonight.\u201dUpon hearing Wang Xian, the girl frowned slightly with unhappiness flashing in her eyes, \u201cHow would having Japanese food be a waste of time. Besides, it delicious. I bet you haven\u2019t had it before.\u201d\u201cForget it. Let\u2019s not have Japanese food. We will have something simple for lunch!\u201d Jia Wenrui told the girl, \u201cLet\u2019s do the Japanese food tomorrow.\u201d\u201cFine!\u201d The girl was displeased but she did not refute Jia Wenrui. Instead, she continued to chat beside him.While Jia Wenrui was chatting beside that girl, his eyes often drifted to Xiao Yu.But Xiao Yu was talking happily with Wang Xian and Xiao Mi as they were sharing their funny stories about their driving lesson during the summer break.\u201cLet\u2019s take a cab to the city center. We can take a rest after lunch and shop for stuff over there.\u201dThe group of people nodded to Wang Xian\u2019s suggestion.The group divided into three per cab. Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, and Xiao Mi shared a cab.\u201cXiao Yu, that handsome guy just now seems to like you!\u201d When they were in the cab, Wang Xian beamed to Xiao Yu as he spoke.\u201cHeh,\u201d Xiao Yu lifted her chin with some pride but shook her head subsequently, \u201cI don\u2019t like Jia Wenrui. He seems cheeky and thick-skinned. I prefer the type of people similar to my brother. Brother, I haven\u2019t seen you for such a long time, and you have become even more good-looking. Isn\u2019t it so, Xiao Mi?\u201d\u201cSenior Wang Xian really became more attractive!\u201d Xiao Mi looked at Wang Xian and replied with her cheeks blushed.\u201cHehe, of course. My brother is the most handsome and kindest person.\u201d Xiao Yu smiled and continued, \u201cIf I\u2019m getting a boyfriend, I must find someone like my brother.\u201dWang Xian chuckled. He turned to Xiao Yu and reminded her, \u201cI\u2019m telling you\u2026 you are allowed to date when you\u2019re in the university, but the guy must be good enough. Otherwise\u2026 you know me\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Brother. But I\u2019m not preparing to date when I\u2019m schooling unless I meet someone like you. Hehe.\u201d Xiao Yu laughed.The happiest thing for her was to be able to attend school with her brother. A boyfriend was nothing to her. I have my brother, right?Wang Xian nodded with satisfaction.The cars reached the city center. The group of nine people came to a building and had some lunch. After the generous Jia Wenrui fought to pay for the bill, the bunch of youngsters began to shop excitedly.All the girls traveled here lightweight. Their parents must have given them money to shop for their clothes and stuff.Wang Xian also noticed those youngsters were quite well-off.\u201cLet\u2019s go shopping. I want to buy a computer and some clothes.\u201dAfter lunch, everyone was excited.\u201cLet\u2019s buy some clothes first. They\u2019re lighter to carry,\u201d Wang Xian suggested to them.\u201cYes, Senior.\u201d Jia Wenrui nodded and asked with a smile, \u201cSenior, where can we buy branded clothes here?\u201d\u201cI also want to get a bag. I\u2019ve been carrying this for half a year. It\u2019s time to change,\u201d the girl that looked like some online celebrities said with a sense of superiority.After some chats during lunch, Wang Xian found out that this girl was called Jiang Shuang.\u201cWenrui, Jiang Shuang, both of you are nouveau riches. We can\u2019t afford branded stuff. But we can join in for fun,\u201d the rest of the boys said with envy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHehe, it\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s see if we have time in the afternoon. I\u2019ll buy a car. I took $200,000 from my parents to buy a car for daily transportation.\u201d Jia Wenrui smiled as he spoke. But his eyes were full of egotism.\u201cWow, you\u2019re rich,\u201d the boys exclaimed in surprise with an envious look.\u201cI\u2019ll take you guys there.

Let\u2019s go to this mall.\u201dWang Xian led them into the mall. He had been to this mall once and spent over $50,000 on three sets of clothes.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go then.\u201dJia Wenrui smiled and walked in.\u201cThe guys\u2019 section is on the second floor and the girls\u2019 section is at level three. Let\u2019s head to the second floor first. I\u2019d like to get two sets of clothes.\u201d Jia Wenrui\u2019s lips curved into a smile as he spoke to the group behind him.\u201cAlright, alright. Let\u2019s follow and take a look.\u201d The other guys smiled and followed Jia Wenrui.It was clear that Jia Wenrui was rich and had treated them to meals. Therefore, they were seeing him as the leader of the group.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Jia Wenrui waved his hand and walked at the front of the group.Xiao Yu held on to Wang Xian\u2019s arm and followed behind while looking at the surroundings.When the group arrived at the second floor, Jia Wenrui headed to the Armani Specialty Store and walked in confidently.The group followed. When they saw the price tags on the clothes, the group of guys couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads.\u201cIt\u2019s so expensive! Just a casual shirt costs $700-800. There are even some that cost a few thousand,\u201d Xiao Yu said to Wang Xian.\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a world-wide brand and it\u2019s natural that the price isn\u2019t cheap!\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s really expensive. Even I can\u2019t afford such luxurious clothes,\u201d Xiao Mi stuck out her tongue and said.\u201cIs it expensive?\u201d At this moment, Jiang Shuang\u2019s voice sounded from the side. She gave an indifferent look at Xiao Yu and commented, \u201cA $700-$800 shirt is common. Armani is world-wide. Wearing it naturally allows one to have a different disposition. One\u2019s disposition has a lot to do with the clothes they are wearing. You wouldn\u2019t understand even if I explain to you.\u201dJiang Shuang had a slightly arrogant look on her and was clearly looking down on Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi.It was especially so for Xiao Yu. All her clothes together wouldn\u2019t cost more than $200 and yet she was able to attract the attention of Jia Wenrui. This made her really jealous of Xiao Yu.When Xiao Yu heard her comments, she pouted slightly. However, she didn\u2019t say anything. She knew that she couldn\u2019t compete with others when it came to money and she didn\u2019t want to make such comparisons.Wang Xian looked plainly at Jiang Shuang.\u201cXiao Yu, what do you think about these clothes on me?\u201dAt this moment, Jia Wenrui had just changed into a new set of clothes. He walked in front of Xiao Yu.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good.\u201d Xiao Yu answered perfunctorily and nodded her head.\u201cWenrui, I feel that a blue shirt would look better on you. Although white matches well with black, blue would be more suitable.\u201dJiang Shuang immediately walked over to Jia Wenrui from the side and suggested to him.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll just take these.\u201d Jia Wenrui smiled and shook his head at Jiang Shuang. After which, he turned to Wang Xian and said, \u201cSenior, let me pick a set of clothes and gift them to you.\u201dWhen Wang Xian heard the sudden words from Jia Wenrui, he shook his head and replied, \u201cThank you. That\u2019s not necessary.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Jia Wenrui smiled and looked to Xiao Yu. \u201cYou are Xiao Yu\u2019s brother and I\u2019ll need to get on your good books! Moreover, a set of clothes only costs a few thousands and that\u2019s nothing to me. I hope that our relationship could be better. Hehe.\u201dAs Jia Wenrui spoke, he had a confident smile on. He knew the family conditions of Xiao Yu and Wang Xian. Therefore, he was very confident.He believed that he was really outstanding to the point that Xiao Yu, and even her brother, wouldn\u2019t possibly reject him.Therefore, Jia Wenrui didn\u2019t say it in a more subtle way. Upon hearing his words, Xiao Yu frowned slightly.Wang Xian also raised his eyebrows. He noticed Xiao Yu\u2019s response and said directly, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You are not the type my sister is fond of so you wouldn\u2019t have to do so.\u201dHe knew that Xiao Yu wasn\u2019t fond of Jia Wenrui but was too shy to reject him. Therefore, he said it for her and rejected him directly.Jia Wenrui\u2019s face stiffened upon hearing Wang Xian words and was speechless.A face to face rejection! Moreover, it\u2019s a direct and clear rejection. This made him feel shameful.The surrounding people were also slightly shocked. They had not expected Wang Xian to be so direct in his rejection of Jia Wenrui.When Jiang Shuang heard Wang Xian\u2019s reply, a tinge of joy flashed in her eyes. However, when she saw the embarrassment on Jia Wenrui\u2019s face, she quickly walked in front of him and said, \u201cWenrui, you are really outstanding. It\u2019s her who is not deserving of you. Your family conditions are great and you are good looking. There would be many girls who would be fond of you.\u201d\u201cSenior, aren\u2019t you going a little overboard by being so direct. You should at least give him some face,\u201d a guy by the side said to Wang Xian after noticing the displeasure on Jia Wenrui\u2019s face. [1]\u201cI was just speaking the truth.\u201d Wang Xian said with indifference.\u201cTsk. Alright, I thought too much into this.\u201d Jia Wenrui looked a little embarrassed. He stared at Wang Xian and sneered, \u201cSince senior couldn\u2019t tell who\u2019s sincere, forget it then.\u201dWang Xian smiled and didn\u2019t say another word. In his eyes, these guys in front of him were still too young and childish.Arrogant, show off, childish, materialistic.\u201cWenrui, why go and try to get on the good books of an inferior person? Do you still want to get some clothes, I\u2019ll help you pick some.\u201d Jiang Shuang looked at him and tried to console him.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Jia Wenrui shook his head while looking at Jiang Shuang. \u201cLet\u2019s go get your clothes. I\u2019ll buy a set for you.\u201d\u201cReally? You are the best, Wenrui!\u201d Jiang Shuang was taken aback and spoke in ecstasy.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Jia Wenrui took a glance at Wang Xian and Xiao Yu with a heavy expression before heading to the third floor. Jiang Shuang was full of smiles as she followed behind and the group of guys quickly followed too.Wang Xian saw that the group had left before looking to Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi by her side. He shrugged his shoulders and asked, \u201cDo you all still want to follow them?\u201dXiao Mi had a bitter look and looked to Xiao Yu. \u201cWe don\u2019t belong to the same circle as them. Why don\u2019t we go on our own?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xiao Yu nodded her head. She hesitated before adding, \u201cWe are really not the same kind. Let\u2019s not follow them. After all, we will not be in the same class in the future.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. Let\u2019s go. Didn\u2019t I say I\u2019d get you a big gift before school starts? Let\u2019s go up too.\u201d Wang Xian looked at her and smiled.\u201cHmm? Brother, why don\u2019t we head back? Bring us to somewhere more interesting!\u201d Xiao Yu lifted her head and looked at him.\u201cWe can leave that for tomorrow. Let\u2019s get you some stuff today.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s lips curved into a smile as he said to Xiao Yu. \u201cIt will be fine. Just follow me.\u201d\u201cBrother, what are we doing upstairs?\u201d Xiao Yu asked in doubt.\u201cOf course, to buy things!\u201d Wang Xian smiled and pulled her to the lift.\u201cHuh? It\u2019s alright brother. The clothes here are too expensive.\u201d Xiao Yu shook her head immediately.\u201cDon\u2019t argue. Just follow!\u201d Wang Xian turned his head around and spoke with a strong tone.\u201cOh!\u201d Seeing her brother acting this way, Xiao Yu pouted and simply followed.The third floor was entirely for the ladies. Various worldwide brands were all gathered on this floor.When they arrived at the third floor, Wang Xian looked straight to a shop. Prada!There\u2019s a rather famous movie called The Queen Who Wears Prada.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPrada was a luxury brand among luxury brands.

But\u2026 But it\u2019s too expensive here.\u201dXiao Yu looked at those luxury brands around her with her eyebrows knit. She knew that her brother was making some money, but she also understood how hard it was for her brother to work for it.She had remained thrifty since young. Hence, she had no desire for these branded clothes except for the practical stuff.Moreover, the clothes here were too expensive. How much money could her brother have?\u201cJust follow me.\u201d Wang Xian\u2019s heart ached for his sister as he stroked her hair.Girls at her age often asked for money to buy clothes and makeup. But his sister was unwilling to spend money on expensive food just to save up.\u201cXiao Yu, stop being naggy and follow me today. I know how much I have and how much I can spend. I\u2019m not spending it blindly,\u201d Wang Xian stared at Xiao Yu and said solemnly.\u201cWell\u2026 Fine then.\u201d Upon seeing the serious look on her brother\u2019s face, Xiao Yu was touched as she held his hand.\u201cThat\u2019s better. Follow me!\u201dWith a smile on his face, Wang Xian walked straight into the Prada store.\u201cWelcome!\u201dThe greeters at the door immediately greeted them.Wang Xian brought them around as he looked at the clothes. He nodded with satisfaction and told the salesgirl, \u201cGet them a set of clothes each. I want pretty clothes that are suitable for their age.\u201dThe salesgirl was slightly stunned as she looked at Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi. Hastily, she nodded. \u201cYes, Sir. Ladies, please come over here. It\u2019s the summer season now, and girls look the best in skirts. This is the most popular Prada skirt series this year. Both of you look like students. This series suits students the most.\u201dThe salesgirl introduced the clothes to Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi enthusiastically.Xiao Yu was stunned. She saw the dresses which the salesgirls were holding onto. They were pretty, but her gaze drifted to the price tag.$33,299.That was the price of the skirt.\u201cBrother, this place\u2026 this place\u2026 We better go to other\u2026\u201dXiao Yu was anxious when she saw the rocket-high prices. How could she afford such expensive clothes?Wang Xian stroked her head and took out a bank card from his pocket. \u201cToday, let\u2019s just finish off the money on the card!\u201dIt was the diamond card from Agricultural Bank of China with more than 5 million.Wang Xian was not short on money now. When he treated Little Kite the other time, the card that Old Qin gave him had 20 million on it.With the revenue his First-grade Restaurant was earning, he had difficulties spending his money away.As Wang Xian spoke, he handed the salesgirl the card, \u201cBring them the clothes!\u201dThe salesgirl was stupefied with the diamond card Wang Xian handed to her. As an experienced salesperson, she knew the card well.Forget about how much money was stored inside, it was definitely enough even if it was overdraft consumption.\u201cYes, Sir. I\u2019ll be choosing the clothes for them,\u201d said the salesgirl excitedly.\u201cBrother, did you make a fortune?\u201d Xiao Yu could not help but ask when she saw his generosity.\u201cHere, ladies. Let\u2019s try on the clothes and see which skirt looks the best,\u201d the salesgirl said to them.Wang Xian smiled at Xiao Yu. Without answering her question, he beckoned to her to go with the salesgirl.\u201cSenior Wang Xian, you can get the clothes for Xiao Yu. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d Xiao Mi shook her head.She knew that Xiao Yu had only her brother to depend on, and their life was tough.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Go ahead. Thank you for taking care of Xiao Yu for such a long time,\u201d Wang Xian smiled at her and said. \u201cJust go.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Xiao Mi hesitated.\u201cXiao Yu, drag your best friend along.\u201d Upon seeing Xiao Mi\u2019s look, Wang Xian instructed his sister.Xiao Mi was a nice and innocent girl, and both of them were on good terms.Xiao Yu had been staying in Xiao Mi\u2019s house for the entire summer holiday.He would treat anyone good to Xiao Yu nicely.The salesgirl called upon another two salesgirls before they began to let Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi try on the clothes.After she changed into a refined dress, Xiao Yu became more beautiful and gorgeous.Wang Xian was delighted with the look.\u201cSir, look at the clothes your sister is wearing. After school reopens, she can wear them for a very long time.\u201d The salesgirl beamed at Wang Xian.\u201cGood. I\u2019ll take this. The one on Xiao Mi looks good too. What do you think? If you think they are good, just get them packed for you,\u201d Wang Xian said directly.\u201cThis is not bad too. Pack it for me.\u201d\u201cSenior Wang Xian, I\u2019ll take this one. The rest are fine. It\u2019s too expensive.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll buy a bag for you when I get one for Xiao Yu later.\u201dWang Xian nodded to Xiao Mi.After paying for their items, the three sets of clothes cost a total of $100,300.\u201cLet\u2019s go. After these two dresses, we need to get other styles too. Let\u2019s get another two more sets.\u201d Wang Xian smiled and spoke with the bags of clothes in his hand. After shopping in the Prada shop, Wang Xian dragged Xiao Yu out while she was still in bewilderment.\u201cBrother, why do you have so much money?\u201d Xiao Yu asked in disbelief.\u201cI own a restaurant now. Hmm, you\u2019ll find out tonight. Today\u2019s mission is to finish off the card.\u201dWang Xian flashed his card again and laughed.\u201cXiao Yu, your brother is really awesome now!\u201d Xiao Mi exclaimed in bewilderment.\u201cLet\u2019s go.

How much money is left on the card? All items we have bought add up to over $300,000!\u201dWalking out from the Lanc\u00f4me shop, Wang Xian had a few other things in his hands. Currently, his hands were full of bags.However, with his current strength, it was an easy task to carry all these.\u201cLet\u2019s go on. We haven\u2019t gotten any shoes.\u201d Wang Xian smiled. He was also very delighted to see his sister being so jubilant.This was the first time he could buy her things without reserve.\u201cEh, there\u2019s a watch shop right there. You guys can go and take a look first while I organize the things in my hands. There are too many bags right now,\u201d Wang Xian said to his sister.\u201cSenior, let us help you with some of those,\u201d Xiao Mi said, feeling a little embarrassed.Wang Xian shook his head and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. These aren\u2019t heavy anyway. Go and take a look first while I organize these.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go with Xiao Mi then. Brother, you can be our bodyguard today! Hehe!\u201dXiao Yu smiled as she pulled along Xiao Mi into the Patek Philippe Watch shop.\u201cHmm?\u201dWhen the two of them entered, they saw a group of familiar people immediately. Jiang Shuang was in front of the cabinet, trying out the watches.\u201cThe price of this watch is a little over $37,000. It\u2019s a discounted item in our shop and looks great on you,\u201d the store attendant said to Jiang Shuang.Jiang Shuang looked at the watch on her and was truly fond of it.However, her family only gave her $60,000 this time. If she bought this, she would be a little tight on money. Therefore, she was a little hesitant.\u201cHmm? Why did they follow us here?\u201dAt this moment, a guy behind her was surprised to see Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi walk into the shop.\u201cWe didn\u2019t follow you guys here. We are here to take a look at our own accord,\u201d Xiao Mi looked at them and said.Xiao Yu saw Jia Wenrui and the group look over but didn\u2019t pay attention to them. She walked over to the cabinet in front of her and started looking at the watches within it.\u201cThese watches are so expensive!\u201d Xiao Yu was a little shocked by the prices of these watches.As compared to luxury bags, the prices of watches were even more eye-popping.Just a casual watch would cost $30,000 \u2013 $40,000. There were even some that cost over $100,000 or even several hundreds of thousands.\u201cPatek Philippe is a world-class watch brand. A good watch could cost as much as a luxury car,\u201d Xiao Mi reminded her from the side.Xiao Yu\u2019s jaw dropped open. She looked into the cabinet and saw a watch that cost $80,000. \u201cThis watch is so beautiful.\u201d\u201cHey salesgirl, can you take this out for us to take a look?\u201d Xiao Mi said to a salesgirl standing at the side.\u201cTsk, shameless.\u201dAt this moment, Jiang Shuang, who was sitting a short distance away and trying out a watch, looked over at Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi with deep contempt.\u201cYou guys should take a look at the price of the watch. Can you guys even afford it? Taking a look? Can you all pay for it if you scratch it?\u201dWhen the salesgirl heard what Jiang Shuang said, she looked at Xiao Mi and Xiao Yu with hesitation.They were wearing very ordinary clothes. It was especially so for Xiao Yu. In fact, one could say that her clothes were of rather poor quality.They weren\u2019t wearing any accessories and didn\u2019t look like they could afford the watch at all.\u201cAre you sure you are buying?\u201d the salesgirl in front of Jiang Shuang asked them.Xiao Mi and Xiao Yu were furious upon hearing this.This was their first time in such a luxury watch shop and it was natural for them to feel angry when being questioned in such a way by the salesgirl.\u201cCan\u2019t I try it if I\u2019m not sure?\u201d Xiao Mi replied angrily.She knew that Xiao Yu\u2019s brother was rich and could afford it.\u201cHehe, not sure?\u201d Jiang Shuang laughed in a condescending manner. She looked at them and added, \u201cCan you guys afford it? Can\u2019t you see the price on it? You should have taken a look at yourself!\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t afford it, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t try it on,\u201d the salesgirl said after hearing the words of the customer in front of her.\u201cDid you see this? If you don\u2019t have the money, don\u2019t shop around here and waste everyone\u2019s time,\u201d Jiang Shuang mocked.The words of the salesgirl and Jiang Shuang made the faces of Xiao Mi and Xiao Yu turn red rapidly.They were all 18-19 years old girls and naturally wouldn\u2019t have encountered such mockery and belittlement.\u201cWe\u2026 Who says that we can\u2019t afford it\u2026\u201d Xiao Mi was seething in anger! Her eyes had turned a little red, from both anger and embarrassment.Tsk. Jiang Shuang sneered and stood up directly. She said to the salesgirl in front of her, \u201cI\u2019ll be taking this watch on me. Please wrap it up for me.\u201d\u201cThank you, miss. Thank you, miss.\u201d That salesgirl was thrilled and immediately walked over.\u201cI\u2019ll be paying by card!\u201d Jiang Shuang held out a bank card.\u201cXiao Yu.\u201dAt this moment, Jia Wenrui suddenly walked over to Xiao Yu who looked ghastly. He took a glance at the watch in the cabinet.\u201cIf you like it, I\u2019ll buy it for you, but you have to be my girlfriend.\u201dJia Wenrui put on a strong front. He stared intensely at Xiao Yu and continued, \u201cI can give you a life that you could never imagine. All you have to do is to agree to be my girlfriend and you wouldn\u2019t have to suffer with your brother. All you have to do is to agree and you will never have to be looked down on by a salesgirl in a shop.\u201dJia Wenrui revealed a confident look. He knew that his words could definitely move a girl. To him, no one would choose to not pursue a better life.As long as she was with him, he was able to provide.\u201cWenrui!\u201d Jiang Shuang was shocked upon hearing Jia Wenrui. Her face quickly sank and turned hideous as she walked over. \u201cWenrui, she\u2019s just a little brat from a village. Her dressing is bad and her family is poor. Why would you\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dAt this moment, a cold shout pierced through the atmosphere. Even the temperature in the whole shop seemed to have fallen by several degrees.Wang Xian happened to overhear Jia Wenrui\u2019s words when he walked in after organizing the bags in his hand. He also heard what the girl with the online celebrity\u2019s face said about his sister. This made his face twitch with anger.\u201cBrother?\u201d Xiao Yu saw Wang Xian and immediately walked to him. Her face was still a little red with embarrassment and anger.\u201cSenior Wang Xian.\u201d Xiao Mi also walked over.Wang Xian looked condescendingly at Jiang Shuang and Jia Wenrui.\u201cThrash! Thrash that is so full of yourself just because your family is rich.\u201dWang Xian looked coldly at Jia Wenrui and continued, \u201cTsk. Give my sister a life she cannot imagine? With how you are currently?\u201d\u201cDo you know how much these things in my hands are? Did your parents give you enough money?\u201d\u201cSalesgirl, get me the most expensive and the best female watch in this shop!\u201dWang Xian placed the things in his hands on the cabinet as he spoke coldly.Clothes from Prada, bags and clothes from LV, skincare products from Lancome. All of them were the latest design.One of the salesgirls saw the 7-8 bags on the cabinet and was surprised. These things would most likely cost $200,000 \u2013 $300,000!\u201cAlright, alright!\u201d a salesgirl quickly replied. \u201cSir, these are the best female watches we have. This watch has diamonds embedded at this spot and sapphire here\u2026\u201d\u201cThis watch. Payment by card,\u201d Wang Xian said as he pointed to the watch he felt looked the best.\u201cSir, are you really going to buy? This watch costs $888,000. Are you sure?\u201d The voice of the salesgirl was trembling.\u201cWrap it up.\u201d Wang Xian threw the card on it directly.\u201cYes, sir.\u201d That salesgirl was thrilled. What a rich tycoon to spend $888,000 without batting an eye!\u201cGet your manager here,\u201d Wang Xian said coldly to the salesgirl.\u201cYes, sir.\u201d That salesgirl was shocked and quickly ran to a small storage room at the back.A middle-aged woman walked out and looked at Wang Xian. With a warm tone, she greeted, \u201cSir, thank you for visiting Patek Philippe. Is there anything you need?\u201d\u201cMy sister was here a while ago and was looked down on by your salesgirl. Give me an explanation!\u201d Wang Xian said to the middle-aged manager with an indifferent tone.The middle-aged manager was shocked and frowned at the salesgirl.As an international brand, they had very high demands for the quality of service and cared a lot about word-of-mouth.Now, this young customer who spent $888,000 without batting an eye was questioning her directly and wanted her to give him an explanation.In such a scenario, she really had to give him an explanation.Everyone around was dumbfounded.When Jia Wenrui heard Wang Xian calling him \u201cthrash,\u201d he had wanted to retort. However, when he saw the luxury goods in his hands, he was stunned.He knew very clearly about these things. The prices of these items in Xiao Yu\u2019s brother\u2019s hand weren\u2019t cheap.He was even more shocked when he saw Xiao Yu\u2019s brother buy a female watch that cost $888,000 immediately.At the same time, Jiang Shuang was watching Wang Xian\u2019s actions in disbelief.He bought an $888,000 female watch without batting an eye!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe other young men were even more shocked. $8880,000! $888,000 for a single watch!This\u2026Didn\u2019t they say that Xiao Yu and her brother only had each other since young and had a tough life?This is what they consider tough?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ll also answer to you.\u201dThe manager made a bow to Wang Xian, apologizing before he turned to the salesgirl and inquired on the incident.\u201cXiao Yu, come over,\u201d Wang Xian beckoned her. \u201cWhich salesgirl despised you just now?\u201d\u201cBrother, it\u2019s nothing. She was just asking if we can afford it. If we can\u2019t, then don\u2019t bother to try it on.\u201d Xiao Yu was slightly embarrassed when she repeated the incident again.\u201cHehe, we can\u2019t even try when we\u2019re not buying?\u201d Wang Xian sneered at the manager.\u201cOf course not. Those who walk into our shop are our customers. We\u2019ll let customers try on the watches.\u201dThe manager was looking woeful when he was being accused by Wang Xian. He looked at those salesgirls and asked coldly, \u201cWho was the one who said no trying?\u201d\u201cManager, I\u2026 I thought they were\u2026\u201d The salesgirl whimpered as she tried to explain to her manager with a pale-looking face.\u201cDon\u2019t explain to me. If all our staff behaved like you, could we even do any business? Who told you that customers cannot try on the watches?\u201d The manager cut her off without any emotion. \u201cPack your things. Our store has no means to keep such an employee like you.\u201d\u201cManager, I\u2026 I\u2019m in the wrong. Please give me a chance,\u201d the salesgirl pleaded.The manager frowned and looked at Wang Xian, who was watching everything with his impassive look as always. The manager gritted his teeth, \u201cCut your words and resign now!\u201d\u201cWhat a snob,\u201d said Wang Xian to the salesgirl emotionlessly.The salesgirl looked over with a pale-looking face as she was filled with regret.Just then, the other salesgirl packed the watch and said to Wang Xian, \u201cSir, your watch.\u201dWang Xian nodded his head and took over the bag before he passed it to his sister.\u201cTake it. Everyone says girls need to be pampered when they are growing up. Even though you\u2019re a grown-up now, it\u2019s not too late now.\u201dWang Xian smiled as he handed the watch to Xiao Yu. Then, he looked at Jia Wenrui and Jiang Shuang. \u201cYou think you\u2019re rich and you can act snobbish? Heh, I didn\u2019t want to say it, but you\u2019re just brats. Many people are richer than you and your family.\u201dAs he said this, he walked to Jia Wenrui and patted his shoulder, \u201cNever mess around with my sister. You\u2019re not qualified yet. If you don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you, I\u2019ll make sure the consequences are unbearable for you.\u201dAfter Wang Xian finished his sentence coldly, he turned to Xiao Yu and smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Sister. We are still short on shoes. Oh, do you want to get a necklace? Shall we go and get one now?\u201d\u201cNo, Brother. Let\u2019s go.\u201dSeeing her brother standing up for her, happiness and admiration crawled all over Xiao Yu\u2019s face.Her brother had always protected her like this.In the past, he would beat up the people who bullied her. Now, it was even more interesting. If anyone bullied her, he would slam them with money.\u201cLet\u2019s go. I have too many things in my hands. You\u2019ll have to carry some of them later.\u201dWang Xian carried the shopping bags and headed outside.\u201cHow did\u2026 how did Xiao Yu\u2019s brother become a rich man?\u201d Gazing at their back views, a guy behind murmured in shock.Jia Wenrui was looking sulky as his mouth twitched.What Wang Xian had said just now was in outright contempt, humiliation for how he was behaving on the first story just now.Yet, he did not dare to say anything. Since Wang Xian could take out $880,000 like a breeze for a watch, he could be someone formidable in the Rivertown.He dared not rebuke as he was afraid Wang Xian would find someone to hurt him.Jiang Shuang, on the other side, gazed at the back of Xiao Yu with jealousy.Why? Why does Jia Wenrui detest herself and like Xiao Yu?Why does she have such a formidable brother?She took a glance at the watch she bought with heartache. Her face paled when she thought of the expensive watch Xiao Yu\u2019s brother had bought without thinking.It was futile to make a comparison.\u201cOkay, Brother. We\u2019ve got enough stuff. Everything is in.\u201d After getting the shoes, they even bought a few sets of lingerie. Xiao Yu was carrying some shopping bags when she spoke to Wang Xian.\u201cYes, everything, including the clothes, is in.\u201dWang Xian pondered as he observed the things in his hand, \u201cWe\u2019re still short a notebook, a phone, and another iPad. That should be done. Oh, Xiao Yu, what else do you need?\u201d\u201cGosh, my dear beloved brother. It\u2019s enough. The computer and such\u2026\u201d\u201cYou will get to use the computer. There\u2019s an Apple store here. Let\u2019s go.\u201dWang Xian interrupted her and walked out on his own.Xiao Yu looked at her brother and followed behind with a happy smile.The gadgets were not expensive. A laptop, a phone, and an iPad cost only $30,000.\u201cBrother, we\u2019re really done with the shopping. Let\u2019s put these things in your dormitory, shall we?\u201dXiao Yu smiled as she looked at Wang Xian, whose hands were full of shopping bags.\u201cI\u2019ll get you girls a hotel. Let\u2019s put the things inside and take a rest,\u201d Wang Xian smiled and said.\u201cAlright, Brother.\u201d Xiao Yu nodded.Wang Xian looked around and fixed his gaze on the Summer Sun International Hotel, the hotel owned by Xue Family.\u201cCome on, follow me.\u201dAs Wang Xian spoke, he took the lead in front and headed towards the Summer Sun International Hotel.When Xiao Yu was at the entrance, she gazed at the hotel\u2019s name and murmured, \u201cSummer Sun International Hotel, 5-star hotel.\u201dIf it were in the past, she would never allow her brother to let her stay in such an expensive accommodation. But now, she has seen how her brother behaved like a nouveau riche. Hence, she was adapting to it slowly.\u201cBabe, give me a presidential suite,\u201d Wang Xian came to the reception desk and said to the receptionist.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir. Our Presidential Suites are all fully booked. Would you like to choose another room?\u201d The receptionist apologized to Wang Xian.\u201cBrother, Xiao Mi and I can stay in a standard room. There\u2019s no need for a Presidential Suite. Don\u2019t waste your money.\u201d Xiao Yu tugged his hand immediately.\u201cFine. Just get me any room.\u201dWang Xian nodded his head reluctantly. He took out the Family membership card that the Xue Family gave him and handed it to the receptionist.When the pretty receptionist received the Family membership card, she was slightly stunned as she was shocked to see the Summer Sun membership card.When she swiped the card on the machine, the computer immediately sounded off. \u201cWelcome our distinguished members for the Family membership card. You\u2019ll enjoy the best service in the hotel.\u201dThe pretty receptionist was stunned while the other two receptionists popped over immediately. They were shocked to say, \u201cIt\u2019s the Homeland Card; the most prestigious membership in the Summer Sun Hotel. Members will get to enjoy the best service in the hotel for free. Gosh!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe pretty girl who was holding the card recovered from her shock. She immediately said respectfully, \u201cSorry sir. Our hotel has reserved a separate Presidential Suite dedicated to the members of the Homeland Card. I\u2019ll take you there now.\u201d\u201cSure, thanks.\u201d Wang Xian nodded.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the pretty receptionist replied immediately.Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi were staring at Wang Xian with surprise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This hotel, you\u2026\u201dWhen Xiao Yu saw the enthusiastic, or rather respectful, actions of the front desk receptionist, she couldn\u2019t contain her curiosity and asked.\u201cOh? This hotel belongs to a friend of mine, the Xue Family. They also have another holiday resort by the sea. This membership card was a gift from them. With this, everything will be free in this hotel and the holiday resort. Moreover, we will be able to enjoy the best service.\u201dWang Xian explained to Xiao Yu nonchalantly. \u201cI\u2019ll find some time to bring you guys over to the holiday resort to play after tomorrow. It\u2019s pretty good! It\u2019s also a five-star holiday resort.\u201dXiao Yu\u2019s mouth opened and had a shocked expression.Seeing her expression, Wang Xian caressed her head and said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing your brother can\u2019t settle in Rivertown in the future. Therefore, don\u2019t be scared. Be confident because you are my sister.\u201d\u201cBrother, you are so awesome now!\u201d Xiao Yu\u2019s eyes shimmered as she stared at him.\u201cI guess I\u2019m doing pretty alright!\u201d Wang Xian smiled.\u201cMr. Wang, we are here. This is a room we use to receive our most important guests. There will also be a personal assistant.

The decorations were extremely luxurious and one could see the beautiful city center by simply drawing the curtains and looking out.\u201cWow, what a huge room!\u201d Xiao Mi looked around with surprise.\u201cNot bad. You guys could stay here tonight.\u201dWang Xian put the things down, sat on the sofa and poured a cup of water for himself. \u201cTake a break for now. It\u2019s only 3 pm. Let\u2019s go get something else in a while.\u201d\u201cWe are still getting more? Brother, we already have all the things we need.\u201dXiao Yu sat beside him. She held on to Wang Xian\u2019s arm and said, \u201cBrother, you are so nice to me.\u201d\u201cGreat that you know your brother is nice to you! Take a 10 minute break. What we are getting in a while will be useful to me too. Moreover, I have said that we are going to spend all the money on the card.\u201dWang Xian smiled.After taking a short break, Wang Xian brought Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi out and called for a car.\u201cSir, please take us to Cheyun Street,\u201d Wang Xian said to the driver.\u201cTaking a look at the car exhibition?\u201d the driver smiled at them and asked.\u201cCar exhibition?\u201d Wang Xian was surprised and asked. \u201cSir, is there a car exhibition today?\u201d\u201cYeah, don\u2019t you know about that? I thought you were going to the car exhibition. Today\u2019s the last day of the exhibition. There\u2019re quite a number of people at the car exhibition. Hehe. And a lot of beautiful models\u2026\u201d The driver raised his eyebrows.\u201cOh? Are there a lot of cars on exhibition?\u201d Wang Xian asked.\u201cYeah, how could there not be? There\u2019re lots of supercars. The scale of this car exhibition is really big. You will know once you see it in a while.\u201d The driver nodded his head.Cheyun Steet was where the 4S showrooms for cars in Rivertown were gathered. [1] Anyone who wished to buy a car in Rivertown would typically come to this place.After alighting the car, Wang Xian brought Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi and looked ahead.In the direction they were facing, there were many banners hanging around. The biggest one of all read \u201cRivertown 5th Car Exhibition.\u201dThe exhibition hall was huge and one could see many people shopping in it. There were cars of various brands on display.\u201cLet\u2019s go and get you a car. The reason why I\u2019ve asked you to learn to drive in the summer is so you could become brother\u2019s driver. Hehe.\u201dWang Xian chuckled.\u201cHow could you let your sister be your driver! You are so thick-skinned!\u201d Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at him but still followed Wang Xian in.\u201cIsn\u2019t that because I have no time to get a license!\u201d Wang Xian laughed and walked ahead.\u201cThere\u2019re quite a number of people at this car exhibition. There\u2019re a lot of models here too.\u201dWang Xian looked around and saw many people. Some were looking at the cars while many others were looking at the car models.In front of each car brand, there were 3-4 car models. These car models were wearing seductive clothes that complemented their great figures. The cleavage they were showing added heat to the already hot summer.There were also quite a number of people taking photos, amongst which many were taking photos of these car models.\u201cWow, there\u2019re so many people and cars!\u201dXiao Yu and Xiao Mi looked around them and were observing the surroundings in curiosity.\u201cThis car\u2019s look is so beautiful!\u201dRight ahead of Xiao Yu and at the entrance, there were several luxurious cars that were worth several million on display.Xiao Yu pointed to a Rolls-Royce and exclaimed.\u201cRolls-Royce Phantom! This car costs at least $6-7 million!\u201dWang Xian looked at the Rolls-Royce and was getting a little excited too.Men always had a love for supercars. Therefore, it was only natural that he would like such a domineering-looking car.However, he didn\u2019t have a license and couldn\u2019t drive a car.And the Rolls-Royce was clearly not suitable for Xiao Yu.\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look around,\u201d Wang Xian said to them before walking further in.\u201cWow, this sports car is so cool.\u201d Xiao Mi\u2019s eyes lit up when she saw the Lamborghini beside her.\u201cYeah. However, it would probably be hard to drive if the road conditions are bad!\u201d\u201cThat Benz ahead looks pretty domineering.\u201d\u201cBenz G-series, the love of every man. Senior Wang Xian, why don\u2019t you get a car like this. It would be so cool.\u201dXiao Yu and Xiao Mi looked at the same car fervently as they commented raucously.Wang Xian simply smiled and agreed with what they were commenting as they looked through the collection of cars.This car exhibition was indeed pretty large scale. One could easily see international luxury car brands in this exhibition.Wang Xian was trying to decide on a car to get for Xiao Yu.He had looked up information on this a few days ago. For a girl, a Maserati would be more suitable and a top-end Maserati would cost less than $3 million.Nonetheless, he still wanted Xiao Yu to make her own decision and would like to see what she would like to drive!\u201cWow, that car is so stunning!\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s really stunning and it\u2019s pink! That\u2019s simply beautiful.\u201dAt this moment, Xiao Yu exclaimed and walked ahead. Xiao Mi\u2019s eyes followed Xiao Yu as she walked over too.Wang Xian lifted his head and looked over. It was a pink Bentley Continental! A look at it was enough to capture the hearts of any young girl.The elegance and luxury of a Bentley paired with its pink color made it a classic car that fair, rich and beautiful woman would prefer.Seeing Xiao Yu\u2019s excited expression, Wang Xian followed behind.\u201cWow, stunning!\u201d\u201cA Bentley! A Bentley is very expensive and would cost at least a few million. Nonetheless, this pink Bentley is really breath-taking!\u201d\u201cYeah! However, driving this car around would be a little too eye-catching.\u201dXiao Yu and Xiao Mi were discussing and couldn\u2019t help but take out their phones to take a few photos.Wang Xian simply smiled by the side and didn\u2019t comment.

As they walked further in, the cars in the show were mostly low to mid-range brands. The three of them walked one round briefly.\u201cWhich car looks better?\u201d asked Wang Xian to Xiao Yu with a smile.\u201cIn terms of appearance, the pink Bentley is the nicest. Maserati is pretty, but if we\u2019re getting a car, I suppose a BMW or Mercedes Benz will do,\u201d said Xiao Yu to Wang Xian with a smile.\u201cCome with me.\u201dWang Xian nodded and smiled. He thought that since he was still left with over 4 million in his card, it should be enough to get that pink Bentley.When they returned to the pink Bentley, many people were gathered around, and the majority of them were ladies.The Pink Bentley gave off youthful vibe amid elegance. Indeed, it was attractive to the ladies.\u201cHubby, when you have the money, you can get me the pink Bentley, right?\u201d\u201cNo problem, Wifey. Tomorrow. If I got the lady of luck tomorrow, I\u2019d buy it for you!\u201d\u201cTomorrow? Hubby, why do we have to wait till tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI bought a lottery ticket, and the result will only release at night. If I win the first price, we can come and collect the Bentley immediately.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You go to hell.\u201dWhen they walked over, they overheard the young couple\u2019s conversation. Everyone around them was smiling amiably.\u201cThis car is lovely, but it\u2019s too expensive. The entire car would cost 4.2 million. Alas!\u201d A middle-aged man who dressed like a successful businessman in his suit shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s Bentley. Even slightly cheaper ones will cost 3 million. The price of this pink Bentley can buy two decent houses,\u201d a girl next to the car mumbled as she could not stop taking pictures of the vehicle.Many people fancied the car, but they were being put off by the price.\u201c4.2 million?\u201dWang Xian observed the car carefully. He made a decision after he noticed that Xiao Yu took a fancy to the car.\u201cHey, handsome!\u201d Wang Xian called upon the salesman who was standing next to the car.\u201cSir, how may I help you?\u201d the young salesman looked at Wang Xian puzzledly and asked with a smile.\u201cCan we do a test drive?\u201d As Wang Xian asked, he took out a bank card. \u201cWe\u2019ll buy it immediately if we\u2019re satisfied with it!\u201dThat young salesman was slightly taken aback as he looked at the bank card in Wang Xian\u2019s hand. Immediately, he replied, \u201cSir, hang on. I\u2019ll get my manager here!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Xian nodded.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d After the conversation, Xiao Yu tugged Wang Xian\u2019s arm and shook her head, \u201cBrother, this is too expensive. Besides, it\u2019s too striking\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you to finish the money on the card. After getting this car, the card should have about $30,000 left. Just nice for your pocket money.\u201d Wang Xian chuckled.\u201cYou still have more than 4 million on it?\u201d Xiao Yu\u2019s eyes were agape with her lips slightly parted. She looked cute with her shocked look.This afternoon, they had already spent almost $300,000 on their clothes and bags. After paying for a watch that cost nearly $900,000, the card still had more than $4 million on it.\u201cGosh, he\u2019s a nouveau riche indeed. Diamond card from the Agricultural Bank of China. To get that card, you\u2019ll need at least $5 million in your account.\u201d\u201cSomeone is really buying the pink Bentley. He\u2019s rich.\u201d\u201cThis is the true-blue nouveau riche. Buying a Bentley for his sister. Why don\u2019t I have such a good brother?!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the rich second generation. I\u2019m sure. It seems like they spent the money on the card in just a day. Oh gosh!\u201dThe crowd stared at Wang Xian shockingly.A slender and tall figure with good-looking appearance. At the same time, he had a unique demeanor which gave off a noble vibe.But the two girls beside him were somewhat ordinary even though they were pretty.After all, there were too many pretty girls in this era.\u201cXiao Yu, your brother is filthy rich now. He is actually buying you a Bentley that is over $4 million. if you drive this to school, I really can\u2019t imagine\u2026\u201d Xiao Mi shook Xiao Yu on her arm as she spoke with her eyes bright.\u201cXiao Mi, do you think I\u2019ve become rich overnight?\u201d asked Xiao Yu dumbfoundedly.\u201cYou\u2019re a swan that turns into a Phoenix now. I envy that you have such an awesome brother!\u201d Xiao Mi said with envy.\u201cHehe!\u201d Xiao Yu chuckled as she wrapped her arms around Wang Xian\u2019s arm.\u201cSir, are you buying this car?\u201d At this time, a middle-aged man was taking big steps as he followed beside the young salesman. With enthusiasm, he asked Wang Xian.\u201cYes, but can we do a test drive?\u201d Wang Xian asked, \u201cMoney is not an issue. We\u2019ll buy the car immediately if there\u2019s no problem.\u201d\u201cSure, of course!\u201d The middle-aged manager answered without the slightest hesitation. He knew that the young man had the buying power.\u201cGreat, where can we do the test drive?\u201d asked Wang Xian.\u201cSir, there\u2019s a place outside just for test driving. I\u2019ll accompany you guys there,\u201d the middle-aged manager replied immediately.\u201cOkay,\u201d Wang Xian nodded and looked at Xiao Yu with a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a test drive!\u201d\u201cBrother, I\u2019ve only had my driving license for a few days. What if I damage the car?\u201d Xiao Yu said with a bitter face, as she did not dare to drive.She knew the repair cost of the car would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. The manager next to you will remind you. Besides, the car is insured after you buy it. If you hit the car, just repair it!\u201d Wang Xian smiled as he spoke without much thought.The manager next to them chuckled when he heard Wang Xian. \u201cYes, babe. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dThere was another sentence that he did not spell out: Nouveau riches are rich. You don\u2019t need to worry!\u201cFine!\u201d Xiao Yu nodded her head and walked to the car. The middle-aged manager sat in the passenger seat to drop reminders to her. Wang Xian and Xiao Mi were seated at the back seats.\u201cHere, babe, I\u2019ll do an introduction!\u201dThe middle-aged manager got into the car and began introducing the various functions of the luxury car to Xiao Yu.Xiao Yu listened with flickering radiance in her eyes. The functions of this car were not what the cars in the driving school could compare to.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll take a drive out for two laps!\u201d the middle-aged manager said with a smile.Xiao Yu took a deep breath and spun to look at her brother.\u201cDon\u2019t worry and drive on. Don\u2019t be scared,\u201d Wang Xian said with a smile.\u201cYes, brother!\u201d Xiao Yu nodded and drove out cautiously.She was driving with care as she had just gotten her license. But after two rounds of the test drive, she got her smile back on her face.Driving a luxury car was better than driving those ordinary cars. To a certain extent, it was a comfortable ride.Wang Xian looked at Xiao Yu\u2019s smile and turned to the middle-aged manager sitting at the passenger\u2019s seat. \u201cI\u2019ll get this car. Prepare all the paperwork for us.\u201d\u201cSure, we promise to get you all the paperwork done today.\u201d The middle-aged manager was excited as his eyes were beaming. \u201cSir, I\u2019ll return to the showroom first. You can take a seat over there while waiting.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Wang Xian nodded.They drove the car back to the car show and followed the manager back to the 4S showroom.\u201cDirector Cui, you\u2019re here!\u201dThe Bentley showroom was spacious, and the decorations were extravagant with various luxurious Bentley cars in it.After they entered the showroom, the manager saw a middle-aged man speaking to a couple with polite smiles. He was slightly stunned as he hurriedly greeted them.\u201cYes, I just arrived!\u201d Director Cui nodded and said. \u201cManager Zhao, Young Master Lin is buying that pink Bentley.

However, he quickly recovered and maintained a smile on his face. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about this, brother, but this pink Bentley has been ordered by someone. If you would still like to have it, you could wait a month and I\u2019ll get the Bentley Headquarters to custom-make one for you.\u201d\u201cThere should be a sequence in buying a car. When we want to buy it, this car hasn\u2019t been sold. Now that we are about to buy it, you\u2019re telling me that it has already been booked? Isn\u2019t this out of line? Are you fooling with me?\u201dWang Xian looked at Director Cui and spoke indifferently.When Director Cui heard his words, his eyebrows knitted together. He was also wary of offending Wang Xian as one who could afford a car over $4 million definitely wouldn\u2019t be a simple man. However, he was more wary of offending the young man beside him.\u201cLet\u2019s do it this way, brother. Why don\u2019t you take a look at other models of car or perhaps you could wait for a month? I\u2019ll get one made for you from the headquarters,\u201d Director Cui looked at him and said.\u201cYou can say this to the young man beside you,\u201d Wang Xian replied.Wang Xian\u2019s reply made Director Cui\u2019s face sink. His eyebrows were closely knitted together.\u201cIn that case, I\u2019m sorry, brother. There\u2019s nothing I can do. This car has already been booked by another customer.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t even paid for it. He\u2019s free to sell it to whoever he wants. What\u2019s there to quarrel about!\u201dThe beautiful girl beside the young man looked at Wang Xian and said, clearly annoyed.That pink Bentley was for her and she naturally wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to snatch it away from her.The young man looked on nonchalantly and didn\u2019t say a word.\u201cThat\u2019s not wrong but I\u2019m not happy about it!\u201dWang Xian smiled and said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m a consumer and I\u2019m not here looking to suffer such unjust feelings!\u201d\u201cThere are many unjust things in the world. What can you do about it? Hehe. Brat! It\u2019s good for you to go through these experiences.\u201dThe young man sneered when he saw how Wang Xian reacted.Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and looked to the manager and Director Cui. \u201cWe are here to buy a car and not for this. After trying out for so long and being just about to buy, you\u2019re telling me it has been booked? Moreover, it\u2019s clear that the other party hasn\u2019t bought it yet.\u201d\u201cHey, brother, we are the seller!\u201d When Director Cui heard his words, his expression got even heavier. \u201cWe are free to choose who we would like to sell to.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you hear them? They are free to choose who they want to sell to! What are you blabbering about? Annoying! They have already said that they aren\u2019t selling it to you!\u201dThe beautiful girl at the side crossed her arms and remarked sarcastically.\u201cGreat, great!\u201d A cold look surfaced on Wang Xian\u2019s face as the anger in him had built up.He was angry over what Director Cui had said. After trying the car for half an hour and being just about to pay for the car, he was told that the car had been sold to another person. Moreover, they weren\u2019t the slightest bit apologetic about it. Saying that they were free to sell to whoever they chose was the final straw.Whoever encountered such an incident naturally wouldn\u2019t feel good about it.\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll let you pay a price for it!\u201d Wang Xian remarked coldly.Since they had made him unhappy, he would also make them unhappy.\u201cPrice? Hehe!\u201d When Director Cui heard him, he smirked coldly and stared at Wang Xian with contempt. \u201cI would like to see what price you could make us pay. Tsk.

He walked towards it directly.\u201cBrat, what do you think you are trying to do?\u201d When Director Cui saw Wang Xian go and pick up the hammer, his expression changed as he roared loudly.Young Master Lin also raised his eyebrows and stared coldly at Wang Xian.\u201cWhat am I trying to do? Since you made me unhappy, I\u2019ll just have to vent it out a little.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s lips curved into a smile and he turned his attention to within the shop.There were approximately 10 Bentleys in the shop.

The hammer in his hand smashed down on the Bentley once again.A huge dent appeared after a single smash. After smashing the Bentley 4-5times, the Bentley looked completely wrecked.However, Wang Xian didn\u2019t stop and simply walked to the next Bentley to continue smashing.\u201cSTOP! Call security. Get the security over here and kill him\u2026\u201dSeeing that Wang Xian had smashed two Bentleys, Director Cui\u2019s eyes had turned red in anger as he roared loudly.The young man by the side threw the cigarette on the floor and stared at Wang Xian callously.Wang Xian smiled plainly and said, \u201cAfter I\u2019ve smashed all the cars, do show me what will happen to me.\u201dCurrently, Wang Xian wasn\u2019t afraid of anyone in Rivertown. Qin Family\u2019s influence could help him settle anything in the society.As for the underworld, he was even less wary of anyone.Bam bam bam!Incessant thumping pierced through the atmosphere. Wang Xian had already smashed five Bentleys when the security guards arrived one after another.\u201cStop! You better stop!\u201dWhen the four security guards saw Wang Xian smashing the Bentley, they were shocked. These are Bentleys that cost over $3 million each!Yet, he dared to just smash!And he had already smashed five of them!Wang Xian saw the group of security guards and smiled. He threw the hammer in his hand on the floor and stared at the red-eyed Director Cui.\u201cCome, I have just smashed five cars. Let me see what will happen to me!\u201d\u201cBastard, you are dead!

The one who ruined him was a Half-step to Inborn Expert.He shuddered at the thought of the old man and the young man.He told his father, the current Master of Ren Family.When his father heard about this incident, he almost killed him to make amends with that expert. But under the persuasion of his mother, his father gave up the thought eventually.His father wanted to bring him along and apologize to them. But he gave up the thought as his father did not wish for anyone in the family to find out about this.If other elders in the family found out that he\u2019d gotten into trouble with such a formidable expert, he would be beaten to death to atone for his sins even if his father did not do so.Blood and brutality filled the world of Ancient Martial Arts.Even though Ren Anzhi escaped the calamity, his cultivation was totally ruined. Initially, he had the chance to inherit the family as the leader. But now, it was completely out of the question.His Elixir Field was completely destroyed, and it was only possible to recover with the help of an Inborn Expert and some medicine.Obviously, the Ren Family was not capable of inviting an Inborn Expert to treat him.After he lost all his cultivation, he was sent to one of the organizations in the family to manage some businesses.\u201cDamm, if it was not for those two idiots, would I have ended up in such a state?\u201dRen Anzhi was sitting in the office, staring at his computer. When he recalled what happened that day, he was fuming.If it was not for those two idiotic brothers-in-law, how would he have ended up in such a state?However, the two of them were also leading a tough life. Their limbs were crippled, and they had to spend the rest of their lives in wheelchairs.Besides, his brother-in-law\u2019s family also compensated him with half of their assets.However, no matter how much money they compensated him with, it could never be enough in exchange for his cultivation.Buzz!Just when Ren Anzhi was feeling vexed, the phone suddenly rang. He displayed an impatient look when he saw the caller\u2019s name on the phone.\u201cSpeak out now!\u201d Ren Anzhi screamed with an unpleasant expression.\u201cDirector Ren, I\u2019m sorry to disturb you. Something happened in our showroom. Someone smashed five of our Bentleys. Five of them! That person even taunted us.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dDirector Cui\u2019s voice stunned Ren Anzhi for a while. He raised his voice with rage, \u201cHas the person left?\u201d Ren Anzhi darkened his expression as he asked with radiance flickering in his eyes.\u201cNot yet, Director Ren. He\u2019s still in the showroom.\u201d\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll be there. God damm it. He\u2019s asking for it!\u201dRen Anzhi revealed a killing expression.

What a fuc*ing fellow.\u201dRen Anzhi stood up immediately with a cold expression as he walked to the showroom.He was going to teach that outrageous fellow a hell of a lesson.\u201cLad, you\u2019re doomed. I\u2019ll make sure you regret what you did for the rest of your life. Just you wait. You\u2019re dead!\u201dBack at the 4S Automobile Showroom, Director Cui spoke to Wang Xian with a hideous look once he got the reply from Director Ren.\u201cDirector Cui, who did you call just now?\u201d Young Master Lin asked with doubt when he heard how Director Cui addressed the person on the line.\u201cI called Director Ren, the son of the Ren Family,\u201d Director Cui answered. He continued\u00a0coldly, \u201cDirector Ren will be here in no time. You are dead.\u201d\u201cThe son of the Ren Family?\u201d Young Master Lin was surprised as fear filled his eyes.Ren Family was a huge and influential family in Rivertown. Lin Family was far more inferior to them. The son of the Ren Family was definitely not someone he could compare with either.\u201cDirector Ren will be here in no time. You\u2019re dead!\u201dYoung Master Lin looked at Wang Xian as though he was a dead man.The pretty girl beside Young Master Lin grabbed his arm and scorned at Wang Xian. \u201cLad, you\u2019re too arrogant. You actually bashed their cars when they didn\u2019t want your business. How ill-educated you are!\u201dWang Xian swept his cold gazes when he heard them. His flickering gaze fixed on the pretty girl and Young Master Lin.Just then, a voice suddenly cut the air before the person could arrive. \u201cWho the hell dares to create trouble in the Ren Family\u2019s turf? Are you sick of living?\u201dWhen Director Cui heard the voice, his eyes flashed with happiness as he hurried over to greet the person.\u201cDirector Ren, that fellow is inside. He\u2019s simply too arrogant. He bashed our cars when we didn\u2019t want to sell the car to him. Director Ren, you must teach him a lesson!\u201d Director Cui explained as he ran.With a cigarette in between his fingers, Ren Anzhi was looking cold as he saw Director Cui running to him. He nodded his head and walked inside.After he entered the showroom, he froze when he saw a young man, leaning haughtily against a Bentley.\u201cHello, Young Master Ren. I\u2019m Lin Feng.\u201d When Young Master Lin saw Ren Anzhi, he quickly went over and greeted him.Yet, Ren Anzhi could not hear what Lin Feng was talking about now.He could see darkness in front of him as if he had fallen into the abyss.This young man, this young man.He would never forget him.His serene smile.His taunting look in the eyes.He recalled that night when even that domineering Half-step to Inborn Expert had to listen to his commands.He felt suffocated.Why, why is it him?How could I be so pitiful that I have to meet this devil-like young man again?Ren Anzhi shuddered in his shoes when he saw the curious and playful look in that young man\u2019s eyes.\u201cDirector Ren, he\u2019s the one who smashed five of our cars.\u201d Director Cui pointed at Wang Xian as he howled angrily to Ren Anzhi.Ren Anzhi paused his breathing, and his expression changed dramatically when he heard Director Cui.\u201cFuc* you! Are you trying to get me killed?\u201dRen Anzhi jumped up and slapped Director Cui hard on his face.He almost exerted all his force on it.

I didn\u2019t know it was you. I have nothing to do with this! It\u2019s all these damned guys who offended Young Master Wang. I have nothing to do with them!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Wang, I\u2019ll apologize to you. We are at fault in this incident. I\u2019ll apologize!\u201dWang Xian had initially wanted to wait for the person Director Cui had called before calling Old Qin or trying to settle it by himself. However, it was beyond his expectations that the person who came was Ren Anzhi.He naturally remembered him very clearly.He was from the Ren Family. Previously, he was asked by Longxuan Restaurant to burn down his First-grade Restaurant. At that time, he was crippled by Mo Qinglong directly.What he had never expected was that Director Ren, whom Director Cui was talking about, was none other than Ren Anzhi.Seeing Ren Anzhi kneel down beside him, on the verge of tears, Wang Xian was speechless.Am I so scary?Is it fine for a guy to act like this?If Ren Anzhi knew what Wang Xian was thinking currently, he would definitely cry out loud. How is he not afraid?Not only are you horrifying, but you are also the embodiment of the devil!Damn it. With a half-step to an Inborn expert as subordinate, how horrifying your background is. A single kick from you is sufficient to finish off the Ren Family.If I let my father know that I just offended this devil again, I\u2019ll probably be killed by him.\u201cI was wondering who Director Cui would call. So, it happens to be someone I know.\u201dWang Xian looked at Ren Anzhi. He rubbed his nose and found this to be a little hilarious.\u201cYoung Master Wang, I didn\u2019t know it was you either. If I knew, I wouldn\u2019t have dared to come, even if you beat me to death\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t dare to\u2026\u201dRen Anzhi was shivering as he broke into tears.\u201cSince we know each other, I believe this matter could be settled easily.\u201dWang Xian looked at him, smiled and squatted down.\u201cYoung Master Wang, we are at fault in this. I\u2019ll apologize. I\u2019ll kill Director Cui as apology. Please calm down!\u201dRen Anzhi trembled at the sight of Wang Xian squatting down. He was completely petrified!At the other end, Director Cui, who got slapped so hard that he bled, finally started to recover from the shock.However, when he heard what Ren Anzhi said, he blanked out and lost consciousness.The security guards around couldn\u2019t help but swallow their saliva as they witnessed this unbelievable twist of events.When Young Master Lin and the beautiful girl beside him saw this, their eyes were in a daze and their faces paled.Even Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi were dumbfounded.Wang Xian looked around before turning to Ren Anzhi. \u201cI\u2019m not an unreasonable man. You can be the judge for me.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Wang, please carry on. Please carry on,\u201d Ren Anzhi replied immediately.\u201cYeah, this is how it happened. I brought my sister here to buy a car and we had our eyes on a pink Bentley. After trying it out for several rounds and making the decision to buy it, Director Cui told me that the car has been sold.\u201d\u201cHe said that the car was pre-booked by that Young Master Lin and wouldn\u2019t sell to me. However, it was clear that at the moment we were trying out the car and had confirmed that we wanted to buy it, this car wasn\u2019t sold yet. In other words, I wanted to buy it first but he sold it to another person. Tell me if you would be angry about it if you were me?\u201d\u201cMoreover, Director Cui wasn\u2019t apologetic at all and asked me to get out. That Young Master Lin and the beautiful girl beside him even said that I was arrogant, I was courting death and was uneducated. Hehe. Tell me now, can you blame me for what I\u2019ve done?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t blame you. We are at fault in this. Young Master Wang, I\u2019ll definitely give you an explanation that you could be satisfied with!\u201dWhen Ren Anzhi heard Wang Xian finish his illustration, he gritted his teeth and replied quickly. He repeated, \u201cYoung Master Wang, I\u2019ll definitely give you an explanation you could be satisfied with. Rest assured, it\u2019s those damned brats who have not followed the rules!\u201d\u201cYeah, they are the one who did not follow the rules. I\u2019m not an unreasonable person!\u201dWang Xian smiled, nodded his head and extended his hand over to pat Ren Anzhi\u2019s shoulders.\u201cNo, No\u2026 Young Master Wang, please don\u2019t\u2026\u201dWhen he saw Wang Xian extending his hand over, he thought that Wang Xian was meting out punishment. His face paled as he begged for forgiveness.However, he suddenly felt a warming feeling from his Elixir Field. To his pleasant surprise, he noticed that his Elixir Field was recovering gradually.This made him stare at Wang Xian in disbelief.\u201cI\u2019m a very reasonable person. As long as you don\u2019t offend me, I wouldn\u2019t offend you!\u201dWang Xian patted on his shoulders and smiled.Ren Anzhi felt the power returning to his body. His face turned red in agitation and his mucus was almost spit out.\u201cThank you, Young Master Wang. Thank you! Young Master Wang!\u201dRen Anzhi was kowtowing to Wang Xian. He was unexplainably agitated as he had not expected that this devil in front of him\u2026 No\u2026 This god-like young man could heal his Elixir Field.He had never expected this to end in such a fortunate way.Wang Xian smiled, stood up and signalled for him to stand up.Ren Anzhi stood up immediately and stood beside Wang Xian with his head lowered like a servant.\u201cFor these Bentleys that I\u2019ve smashed, put it on the tab of Director Cui and that Young Master Lin. Also, Young Master Lin and the beautiful girl beside him threatened me, saying that I wouldn\u2019t even know how I died. Hehe. I leave them to you.\u201dWang Xian smirked as he turned his attention to Young Master Lin and the girl beside him.\u201cRest assured Young Master Wang, leave this matter to me. I\u2019ll definitely not disappoint you.\u201dRen Anzhi lifted his head and guaranteed solemnly. \u201cSince they dare to offend Young Master Wang, I\u2019ll let them know what is meant by not knowing how one died!\u201dRen Anzhi was speaking very loudly. Young Master Lin and the beautiful girl beside him could definitely hear him clearly.When they met Ren Anzhi\u2019s murderous stare, they felt a shudder down their spine and were petrified.\u201cYoung Master Ren, Young Master Ren\u2026 Don\u2019t\u2026 It\u2019s our fault\u2026 Please Young Master Ren!\u201d Young Master Lin\u2019s voice was trembling and he looked horrified.Ren Anzhi looked coldly at Young Master Lin, smirked and said, \u201cHow dare you offend Young Master Wang and behave arrogantly in front of him. Just wait and see. We will have a good time together! \u201d\u201cYoung Master Ren, you can\u2019t do this to me. It\u2019s my fault. Young Master Wang, Young Master Wang, it\u2019s all my fault. I didn\u2019t recognise that it was you. I deserve death!\u201dWhen Lin Feng heard the words of Ren Anzhi, he was completely flustered. He looked towards Wang Xian in horror. In his eyes, this young man was the equivalent of a devil.He was petrified. Even Young Master Ren kneeled down in front of him and begged for forgiveness. Just a word from Wang Xian was enough to make Young Master Ren decide to mess with him.Looking at how Young Master Ren behaved, he might very well be killed.His body was trembling as he begged for forgiveness.The beautiful girl beside him had turned as white as sheet and her whole body was shivering. Who the hell did I offend?Wang Xian glanced at them without emotions.In the eyes of those who offended him, Wang Xian was feared like the devil. Similarly, he could also make others revere him like a god.All of this depended on his mood.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf he was in a bad mood, he could cripple Ren Anzhi. Ren Anzhi\u2019s actions made him satisfied and he could cure him with a wave of his arm.Feared like a devil and revered like a god.With regard to the control he had, Wang Xian enjoyed it greatly.

She took over the key hurriedly and unlocked the pink Bentley.They\u2019d gotten the luxury car without paying a single cent on it.Wang Xian sat in the car and watched smilingly at his sister who drove the car out.Ren Anzhi watched as the car dove away. He wiped the sweat on his forehead with a complicated expression on his face. \u201cWhat a domineering existence. I wonder if I should feel fearful or lucky to meet someone like him. Whatever it is, never provoke him! Never!\u201dHe could destroy you when he is unhappy and heal you easily when he is in a good mood.Radiance flickered in Ren Anzhi\u2019s eyes as he spun his head around slowly.

Because of her, he\u2019d provoked that terrifying existence.\u201cLin Feng, count yourself unlucky to have provoked Young Master Wang,\u201d Ren Anzhi said with icy cold eyes as he walked in slowly.Not many people knew what had happened in the 4S showroom.

Nonetheless, the year two and year three students were also rushing back to school.Just like the freshmen, the year two and year three students also had three days to report to school. However, there were some students who were responsible to receive the freshmen and had to arrive before their reporting dates.By around 10 in the morning, the entrance of the school had gradually seen students gathering.Moreover, there were cars parked everywhere in the vicinity of the entrance of the school. Scenes of parents bringing their children and walking into the university were common.Several young faces were carrying their luggage while looking around constantly at the campus where they would be spending the next few years of their lives.A pink Bentley drove over and stopped beside the school, drawing the attention of a substantial number of students.\u201cLet\u2019s find a place to park the car first. The school forbids us to drive the car into the school today.\u201dWang Xian looked at the surrounding cars and spoke to Xiao Yu who was driving.For the first three days of school, many parents would drive their children to school. In order to prevent congestion, the school forbid cars from entering the school.\u201cAlright, brother!\u201dXiao Yu nodded her head, found a spot and parked the car.\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll carry the things and lead you all to the reporting area. After which, we will head to the dormitory to unpack your luggage!\u201d Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi as he dragged along their luggage.Other than some clothes and their laptops, they didn\u2019t have many other things in their luggage.Blankets were all issued by the school.After locking the car, Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi followed behind Wang Xian eagerly as they looked at the school in front of them with anticipation.Xiao Yu had changed into the new clothes she\u2019d bought the previous day.It was a beautiful long dress from Prada that revealed her fair arms. On her wrist was a watch from Patek Philippe which cost over $880,000.She didn\u2019t put on any makeup and had a natural, confident and beautiful smile.If Xiao Yu was a swan the previous day, she was a beautiful phoenix today!An action or a single smile was enough to attract other\u2019s attention.\u201cIt seems like our University of Rivertown will have another beautiful girl!\u201d Wang Xian looked at Xiao Yu and joked.\u201cHehe. Brother, I have always been an adorable and beautiful girl!\u201d chuckled Xiao Yu.\u201cLet\u2019s go and report. After which, we are going to the dormitory to put down your things!\u201d Wang Xian said as he led them to the reporting area.Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi had the same specialization and therefore Wang Xian brought them to the same reporting area directly.There were teachers and students sitting at the reporting area. Seeing Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi walking over, one of them spoke to Xiao Yu.\u201cJunior, take out your enrollment notice and show it to us. I\u2019ll get some students to bring you to your dormitory and inform you of the location of your classes.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi took out the notice letter while the student at the side checked for the information of their allocated dormitory room.\u201cWang Yu, room 303. Zhang Xiao Mi, room 305. I\u2019ll get some students to bring you there.\u201d\u201cLet me go, let me go\u2026\u201dWhen one of the boys saw Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi, his eyes lit up as he volunteered enthusiastically.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m Wang Yu\u2019s brother and I\u2019m also from this school. I know the location. I\u2019ll bring them over.\u201dWang Xian stood behind and smiled upon seeing the enthusiastic senior.In university, seniors were like wolves and juniors were little lambs. Many seniors would wait for the arrival of the juniors, ready to pounce when the opportunity arose.Wang Xian dispelled the ideas of that senior immediately.\u201cUhm, this\u2026\u201d That guy looked at Wang Xian and was speechless.\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll bring you guys over.\u201dWang Xian smiled and led Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi towards the dormitory.\u201cSo beautiful. That junior is really beautiful.\u201dBehind them, the enthusiastic guy looked at the back view of Xiao Yu and remarked sadly.\u201cHehe, Liuwen, I think you should just give up on that idea!\u201d the girl sitting in front of the table said to the guy with contempt.\u201cWangmei, what do you mean by that? Why did you ask me to give up on the idea? I\u2019m known to be attractive!\u201d\u201cHehe, you should take a closer look at that girl. The Prada dress is at least $30,000- $40,000. Her shoes are at least $4000-$5000. More importantly, if I didn\u2019t make a mistake, the watch on her wrist was the latest female model from Patek Philippe and costs more than $800,000. How would such a fair, rich and beautiful girl be fond of you,\u201d the girl replied with contempt.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d That guy was dumbfounded and swallowed his saliva. \u201cShe\u2019s so rich!\u201dXiao Yu didn\u2019t pick up the comments from the girl behind her. She was full of smiles while observing the surroundings of the school.Wang Xian stood by her side and was explaining to the girls about the school.\u201cThis is the female dormitory. Let\u2019s go to the third floor!\u201dThe first few days of school were the only days when a guy could enter the female dormitory legally. Wang Xian brought them to the third floor.\u201cThis is 303. Xiao Mi, 305 is right there!\u201d Wang Xian pointed to another room and said to Xiao Mi.\u201cWe aren\u2019t in the same room.\u201d Xiao Yu commented grumpily.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We are still staying really close to each other.\u201d Xiao Mi smiled before continuing, \u201cI\u2019ll go unpack my luggage. You should hurry too.\u201dXiao Yu nodded her head and entered her own room.Each school dormitory room was for four people. The beds were at the top while the study desks were below the beds.When they got in, they noticed that the other 3 girls had arrived.\u201cOh, the last lady is here too. Everyone is here now! All four of them!\u201dWhen they just stepped in, a rough manly voice chuckled.\u201cHi, uncle!\u201d Xiao Yu looked over and smiled radiantly at the ordinarily-dressed middle-aged man.\u201cHi, uncle!\u201d Wang Xian also greeted and looked to the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man had an honest smile on him and was probably from the rural areas.However, people like this were also the easiest to get along with.\u201cHello.\u201d The girl beside the middle-aged man greeted Xiao Yu and Wang Xian shyly.The girl looked young and was very shy. Her eyes were bright and had an exquisite look. Her dressing was a little old-fashioned, a classic example of a village girl. Nonetheless, she looked natural.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Wang Yu. This is my brother, Wang Xian. My brother is also from our school and is in year two.\u201d Xiao Yu smiled..\u201cI\u2019m Yuan Yuanyuan.\u201d Yuan Yuanyuan smiled nervously.\u201cCome, let\u2019s chat after unpacking,\u201d the middle-aged man smiled and said as he extended his hand over to help.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, uncle. We don\u2019t have a lot of things to unpack. We can handle it ourselves,\u201d Wang Xian smiled and replied.\u201cAlright, there\u2019s still some space here.\u201d The middle-aged man laughed.Wang Xian nodded his head. There was a blanket on the bed that wasn\u2019t spread open. Wang Xian crawled up the ladder to prepare the bed.As for Xiao Yu, she remained at the bottom to sort out her clothes and computer.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThey didn\u2019t have a lot to unpack and therefore finished quickly.When they were done, the other 3 girls had also finished tidying up with the help of their parents.\u201cCome, try some sweet candies from our hometown. We made them ourselves and they taste really good.\u201dThe middle-aged man took out a bag of snacks from his bag. After opening it, he passed it to the people around him. \u201cCome, have a try.

Here, try it!\u201dThe middle-aged uncle gave a good-natured smile and passed on the food to the other two families.Another two girls came with their parents. One of them was slightly plump, and so were her parents. Given their dressing, their family must not have been too poor.The family closer to the balcony was obviously a wealthier family.The girl was tall and slender with a good-looking face. She wore a large white tee with hot pants, revealing her fair thighs with a tattoo on her leg.Her lips were brightly colored with lipstick.Her mother\u2019s dressing was trendy and she maintained her figure well.Her father had a slight beer belly with a lavish dress sense, just like the way bosses would dress.\u201cThank you.\u201d The family members of the slightly plump girl nodded to the middle-aged uncle with a friendly look as they took some of the food.\u201cIt\u2019s okay for us.\u201dThe mother of the tall and slender girl gestured, \u201cYou guys have it.

She laughed and said, \u201cFengya is not someone good with words.\u201d\u201cUncle, give it to me. It\u2019s delicious, hehe.\u201d Wang Xian chuckled as he stood up when he saw the middle-aged uncle was somewhat embarrassed.\u201cGreat, go ahead. It\u2019s nothing. Hehe.\u201d The middle-aged uncle squeezed out a smile on his face, pretending that he did not hear what that girl had said.He rubbed his palms together when he saw Wang Xian was eating. Feeling embarrassed, he said, \u201cMy daughter, Yuanyuan, is a little shy. I hope her classmates will take care of her and that they\u2019ll get along well with each other. If you wish to have more sweets, let me know. I\u2019ll get Yuanyuan to bring you some.\u201d\u201cYes, my daughter is Su Qian. She has a sweet tooth. Next time, you and Yuanyuan must get along with each other, along with other roommates,\u201d Su Qian\u2019s mother said with a smile.\u201cYes, let\u2019s get along with each other!\u201d The middle-aged uncle chuckled and nodded.\u201cMy sister and I are studying in this university. But I\u2019m a Year Two student now. If you need any help in Rivertown, you can look for me.\u201d Wang Xian smiled.\u201cYoung lad, you\u2019re also from the same school? You must be incredible since both of you made it to the University of Rivertown together!\u201d Su Qian\u2019s father exclaimed in surprise.\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Xian chuckled.\u201cThat\u2019s good then.\u201d The middle-aged uncle agreed with a beaming face.\u201cWe\u2019re local people over here.

I hope the rest of the roommates can help her out,\u201d the mother of the tall and slender girl said smilingly.\u201cWho said I know nothing?\u201d The girl pouted in dissatisfaction.\u201cWhat do you know, kid? Do you know how to do your laundry, wash the toilet?\u201d The lady stared at her.The girl was slightly displeased as she took out a box of ladies\u2019 cigarettes and lit one.\u201cCut the smoking and get along well with your roommates.\u201d The plump middle-aged man looked at his daughter before he turned to look at the rest. \u201cMy kid is pampered. I hope the rest of the roommates can help out in things like cleaning. Thank you!\u201dWhat he said caused the parents of Su Qian to frown, but they did not make any remarks.The middle-aged uncle said nothing either.Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the girl who was smoking. He then turned to her father and asked, \u201cSince you are a local, why doesn\u2019t she just stay at home so that it is convenient to take care of her?\u201dWang Xian was hinting.\u201cOur house is far from the school. It would take about an hour to come here from home,\u201d the middle-aged man smiled and said.\u201cOh.\u201d Wang Xian nodded and continued, \u201cI think the four ladies should be responsible for the things in their room. They should do their own cleaning and keep their own things. The room is not big. It won\u2019t be tiresome to do these. And\u2026\u201d Wang Xian looked at the girl who was smoking and said, \u201cIt would be best not to smoke in the dormitory for girls. That will affect other people.\u201dThe atmosphere suddenly froze after Wang Xian spoke. The middle-aged lady frowned immediately.The girl who was smoking was staring unhappily at Wang Xian.\u201cYou\u2019re right. My daughter is too pampered.\u201d\u201cWhat has my smoking got to do with you? You\u2019re such a busybody!\u201dAt this time, the girl who was smoking suddenly glared at Wang Xian and rolled her eyes at him.\u201cFengya, how can you say such things? I told you to get along with other roommates.\u201d The lady told her daughter off hurriedly.But when she turned to them, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a lady cigarette. It won\u2019t stink.\u201dThe middle-aged man darkened his expression. He looked at the time and stood up suddenly, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be noon. I\u2019ll treat all of you to lunch. It\u2019s also a kind of destiny for the kids to be sharing a room together. Let\u2019s have lunch together.\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s have lunch together so that the kids can get to know each other,\u201d the lady by the side agreed.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d the parents of Su Qian hesitated as they looked at the middle-aged Uncle and Wang Xian.\u201cLet\u2019s go and have something outside,\u201d the middle-aged man stood up again and said.\u201cOkay, then let\u2019s have lunch together.\u201d After much consideration, Su Qian\u2019s parents agreed to it.\u201cSure.\u201d The middle-aged uncle also agreed.But apparently, they had a bad impression of that family and that girl.Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and stood up with Xiao Yu.\u201cHmph!\u201dThe middle-aged man and the lady took the lead and walked out first. Their daughter followed behind. When she walked past Wang Xian, she stared and snorted at him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWang Xian looked at her as he raised his eyebrow.\u201cBrother, this girl is not easy to get along with.\u201d Xiao Yu stuck her tongue out to Wang Xian as she whispered.\u201cLet\u2019s go.

Be careful at the construction site.\u201dThe middle-aged man and Yuan Yuanyuan walked at the back of the group. Her father was carrying a gunny sack with some living necessities in it.Wang Xian turned his head over, smiled at the middle-aged man and asked, \u201cUncle, are you working in Rivertown?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m working at a construction site.

Although it was already September, the sun was still very vicious. However, they weren\u2019t too far and the whole journey took only five minutes.\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll bring you guys to the most famous restaurant in the country, First-grade Restaurant, for a simple meal,\u201d the plump, middle-aged man turned his head around and said to the crowd.\u201cFirst Grade Restaurant?

Just as they were about to greet him, Wang Xian immediately waved at them, signaling for them to not greet. Wang Xian simply followed behind the middle-aged plump man.The two greeters looked inquisitively at him and didn\u2019t continue.\u201cLook! These are world-class ingredients. Hehe. So incredible!\u201dThe middle-aged plump man looked at the world-class ingredients as he smiled and explained.Yuan Yuanyuan\u2019s and Su Qian\u2019s father walked over inquisitively and were shocked by what they saw.\u201cLet\u2019s go.

What are you doing? Don\u2019t you open your eyes when you are walking? Look at what you did to my new clothes!\u201dFollowing this, a sharp shriek pierced the atmosphere.Wang Xian looked over in surprise and saw a tall girl sweeping her hands on her clothes with contempt. She had a ghastly expression on her face.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The middle-aged man quickly turned around and apologized when he saw the stain on her T-shirt.\u201cWhy are you carrying this? Why did you carry such a dirty bag to eat? Don\u2019t you know that this is a high-class restaurant? You\u2026\u201dThe girl was furious and launched a barrage of insults at the middle-aged man.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Fengya?\u201d the lady by the side looked over and asked, concerned.\u201cMom, look at my clothes. These are new and cost over $2,000. They\u2019re stained now!\u201d the girl replied furiously.\u201cUncle is walking in front of you. You probably knocked into him when you were distracted from playing on your phone!\u201dWang Xian looked at this unreasonable girl and spoke with an unfriendly expression.\u201cIf he didn\u2019t carry this, how would I knock into it?\u201d The girl stared at Wang Xian. \u201cWe are in such a high-class restaurant to eat. Tell me, why did he bring along such a damned bag!\u201d\u201cWhy is my father\u2019s bag a damned bag? It\u2019s clear that you knocked into him!\u201dSeeing the girl insulting her father furiously, Yuan Yuanyuan\u2019s face turned red and she wanted to speak up for her father.\u201cDo you know where we are? This is First-grade Restaurant! You group of country pumpkins! Have you ever been to such a high-class place? Can this thing be brought in?\u201d the girl retorted angrily.\u201cAlright, Fengya. It\u2019s just a little dirty and it will be fine after washing!\u201d the lady by the side quickly interrupted.\u201cWho says that First-grade Restaurant doesn\u2019t allow him to bring this in?\u201dWang Xian looked emotionlessly at the girl before turning around and seeing the nervous and lost middle-aged man and the unapologetic lady with her husband.\u201cShouldn\u2019t he know that he shouldn\u2019t bring such a dirty bag here?\u201d the girl rebutted.\u201cWhat poor upbringing! You knocked into him and yet tried to blame him for it?\u201dWang Xian spoke to the girl coldly. This time, he had no intention to be polite and shouted directly.\u201cWhat are you saying? You are the one with a poor upbringing. Have you been here before? This is one of the highest-class restaurants in the entire country. Can this damned thing be brought in?\u201d The girl pointed at Wang Xian.\u201cAlright, Fengya. Stop it! Brat, you should stop too.\u201dThe middle-aged plumped man frowned and shouted.\u201cShut up!\u201dWhen Wang Xian heard his words, he was enraged. He had never thought that he would encounter such a \u201cunique\u201d family.\u201cWho said that you cannot bring a gunny sack in? Tell me! It\u2019s the fault of the parents if the child makes a mistake. Teach your daughter well!\u201d\u201cBrat, since when are you qualified to criticize my daughter?\u201d The lady exploded upon hearing Wang Xian. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with complaining a little after my daughter\u2019s shirt got stained? Besides that, is it appropriate for him to carry a gunny sack here?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHe can if he wishes. Why is it inappropriate? In this place, who dare to say it\u2019s inappropriate?\u201d Wang Xian looked emotionlessly at them..At this moment, the quarrel between Wang Xian and them had drawn the attention of the surrounding crowd.Manager Huang was shocked to hear his boss\u2019s voice.

Then he turned to look at the middle-aged lady and her daughter. With a cold voice, he said, \u201cThe first-grade Restaurant is my restaurant. What\u2019s wrong with my customers carrying a bag when they are dining in my restaurant? Tell me who forbid the bag to be carried here?\u201d\u201cYou know it very well yourself if your daughter is ill-mannered. She was spoilt by you. But I\u2019m telling you this. You can pamper your daughter, but others will not! So, don\u2019t boss people around. No one is giving in to you here. If you have a temper, I\u2019ll beat you till your temper is gone.\u201dWang Xian looked at Manager Huang impatiently and said, \u201cThrow the three of them out. I get annoyed when I see them.\u201d\u201cYes, Director Wang!\u201d Manager Huang nodded his head and looked at the three of them. In a cold tone, he said, \u201cPlease leave the First-grade Restaurant. Otherwise, we\u2019ll chase you out personally.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged couple was stunned with mixed expressions on their faces. They did not expect that the young man before him owned the First-grade Restaurant.Isn\u2019t he just a year-two student? How could he be the boss of the First-grade Restaurant?However, the manager who was staring at them coldly wanted them to get out!The middle-aged man had an embarrassing expression as he clenched his fist tightly.Their daughter was shocked to witness this, and her facial expression changed dramatically.\u201cIf you are not going out, don\u2019t blame us for it.\u201d Seeing that the three of them were keeping still, Manager Huang warned them again.\u201cFine, you\u2019re good!\u201dThe middle-aged man stared at Wang Xian with a darkened expression as he headed out.The lady was fuming with redness flushing to her cheeks. She glared at Wang Xian angrily as she pulled her daughter out of the restaurant.The girl also stared at Wang Xian ferociously as she followed her parents.\u201cNever did I expect that this lad is the boss of the First-grade Restaurant\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man walked out with a sullen look. His facial expression continued to change.Given the current strength of the First-grade Restaurant, he could somewhat guess how influential the boss was. He was only running a construction business for a property company. Even though his status was not too low, he would not dare to provoke the First-grade Restaurant\u2019s boss.\u201cHur?\u201d Just when the plump middle-aged man walked to the entrance, he saw a familiar figure at the door.He stopped walking as an idea came to him. Immediately, he put up a smile and greeted him, \u201cDirector Sun, I wasn\u2019t expecting to see you here!\u201d\u201cHey, Old Zhao, you\u2019re here with your family? Have you eaten?\u201d asked a man with a smile. He was in his thirties, and he was slightly taken aback when he looked at the middle-aged man.\u201cNo, not\u2026\u201d the middle-aged man smiled awkwardly.\u201cI\u2019m meeting a few business friends. Since all of us know each other, let\u2019s have lunch together!\u201d Director Sun smiled as he invited him.\u201cDirector Sun, perhaps\u2026 perhaps you can help me out with one thing.\u201d The middle-aged man looked towards Director Sun hopefully with cold radiance flashing in his eyes.Director Sun and he were quite familiar with each other. To be exact, he was relying on the property developers under Director Sun for his livelihood.Director Sun was working in the property developing company as high management with waters that ran deep.His networking power was extensive as he got dozens of helpers at hand to settle those stubborn households who were reluctant to move.Apart from that, Director Sun owned three to four nightclubs, bars, and KTV. Many people who were working in Rivertown had to lower themselves and address him as \u201cSecond Master Sun\u201d respectfully.Director Sun could almost call the shots in the Rivertown!So what if he was the boss of the First-grade Restaurant when he could ask for help from Director Sun?\u201cHelp? What is it about?\u201d Director Sun looked at the middle-aged man, puzzled.\u201cDirector Sun, just now the boss of the First-grade Restaurant threw us out of the restaurant. I hope you can settle this for me!\u201d said the plump middle-aged man with a bitter face.\u201cThe boss of the First-grade Restaurant?\u201d Director Sun was slightly shocked as his expression darkened when he heard it. He looked at the middle-aged man with radiance flickering in his eyes. \u201cWhy did he chase you out?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026This\u2026 Director Sun, this is a long story. That lad was rude, and he actually scolded my daughter. This is simply too much. Director Sun, I can\u2019t swallow this down. Since you\u2019re so formidable, I hope you can avenge me. I\u2019ll repay you handsomely!\u201d the middle-aged man said with a solemn face.\u201cYou\u2019re kidding your father!\u201d Director Sun looked at the girl beside him and said slowly.\u201cWhat?\u201d the middle-aged man asked puzzledly, hearing his weird remarks.\u201cIt\u2019s all right, wait for my news here., Director Sun said to the middle-aged man with a disdainful look in his eyes.\u201cGreat!\u201d When he heard Director Sun\u2019s promise, sharp radiance filled his eyes. \u201cThank you, Director Sun, for avenging for me. Tomorrow night, I\u2019ll treat you to a sumptuous dinner.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Director Sun gave a gentle nod.\u201cDirector Sun, please have your lunch. I shall not disturb you anymore.\u201d The middle-aged man gave a polite smile as he spoke.Director Sun nodded and entered the restaurant.\u201cHubby, is this the formidable Director Sun that you mentioned?\u201d The lady beside them overheard their conversation and asked with a pair of beaming eyes.\u201cYes, he\u2019s the one.\u201d The middle-aged man revealed a thrilled expression. \u201cDirector Sun has promised that he would avenge for me\u2026 Hmph, a restaurant owner. No matter how famous his restaurant is, he can never outfight Director Sun.\u201d\u201cDad, you should get someone to bash that lad up. He\u2019s too arrogant!\u201d said the girl ruthlessly as she clenched her fist tight.\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d the middle-aged man looked at his daughter and frowned. \u201cCan\u2019t you stop throwing your temper around? With such a character, how can you make friends in school? I wanted to treat them to lunch so that your roommates could take care of you. Now, you ruined everything!\u201d\u201cBut, since Director Sun has agreed, that lad is either going to lose his arm or his leg!\u201d\u201cWho wants them to take care of me? I\u2019m not befriending them. Don\u2019t meddle in my affairs, will you? And Dad, don\u2019t let that arrogant fellow get away that easily!\u201d The girl waved her hands impatiently.\u201cYou imp\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man walked out.\u201cWhat an ignorant fellow!\u201d Director Sun turned and looked back at the family who just left with cold-looking eyes.\u201cBut I have to thank this idiotic fellow!\u201dDirector Sun raised his eyebrow and grinned as he looked inside the restaurant for Wang Xian.\u201cThere!\u201d His eyes brightened up as he walked to a table in the hall immediately.He still remembered clearly how the young man had shouted at the banquet that night.\u201cYou might want to ask if Qin Guohui dares to say this to me!\u201dBack then, everyone was shocked, including him.In particular, Old Qin showed up and chased Second Master Qin out of the Qin Family. Not only this, but Old Qin even bowed and apologized to him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThat scene left a deep impression on him.How formidable could this young man be, such that even Old Qin needed to bow and apologize to him?He was only someone from high management under the ruling of Qin Family.

You are a really nice person,\u201d the middle-aged man recovered and replied. His eyes were a little red from the incident.\u201cIt\u2019s just a small matter. It\u2019s fate that brought us together.\u201d Wang Xian smiled at the middle-aged man. \u201cLet\u2019s go and find a seat.\u201dWith regard to this simple middle-aged man, Wang Xian was fond of him.He still remembered vividly that while living with his sister and grandmother, there was a middle-aged man called \u201cUncle Zhang\u201d who took great care of them.Uncle Zhang was a very nice guy and had been very caring towards him. He also had an honest smile at all times and was passionate about everyone around him.During the harvesting season, Uncle Zhang would always help them, as he knew that Wang Xian\u2019s grandmother couldn\u2019t take the toll.After their grandmother passed away, it was also Uncle Zhang who helped them with the funeral matters. He had even spent a lot of money because of that.I wonder how Uncle Zhang is right now? I should return and repay him for what he has done for me, Wang Xian thought to himself.The middle-aged man in front of him right now was polite, followed the rules and was similar to Uncle Zhang. A look at him and one could tell that he was a great person.\u201cI really hadn\u2019t expected you to be the boss of this restaurant. Incredible! Really incredible! To be so outstanding at such a young age!\u201dSu Qian\u2019s parents were shocked and their eyes lit up while complimenting Wang Xian.\u201cI\u2019m just lucky.\u201dWang Xian smiled. \u201cCome, let us all take a seat. Let\u2019s forget about the unhappy events. As for the girl with a poor upbringing, just ignore her in the future. It will be fine as long as the three of you get along well.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Su Qian and Yuan Yuanyuan nodded their heads while looking at him with eyes of worship.Handsome and righteous! This is the type of guy that every young girl would fall in love with.\u201cYuanyuan, remember to get along with them.

You are?\u201d Wang Xian looked at the young man who had appeared suddenly.\u201cYoung Master Wang, we met once at the banquet of Old Qin. Perhaps Young Master Wang doesn\u2019t remember me.\u201dThis person was none other than Director Sun, as he said respectfully.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry about it.\u201d Wang Xian smiled apologetically but still had doubts about his intentions.\u201cYoung Master Wang, this is what happened,\u201d Director Sun said immediately. \u201cI bumped into Zhao Jingshan and he told me something.\u201dDirector Sun saw the doubtful eyes of Wang Xian and quickly clarified, \u201cZhao Jingshan is the slightly plump middle-aged man. I just bumped into him and his family at the entrance.\u201d\u201cHmm? You know them?\u201d Wang Xian frowned.\u201cI\u2019m not close to him, not even close!\u201d Director Sun explained immediately. \u201cZhao Jingshan is a construction material supplier under Qin Family\u2019s Property Company. I\u2019m a manager of the company and am capable of some things. He wanted me to cause you some trouble when I bumped into him at the entrance a while ago. Such a despicable person has to be punished!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Wang, I suggest that I let the company stop working with him. Moreover, I\u2019ll ask all the developers in Rivertown to not work with him. What do you think of this?\u201d Director Sun asked.\u201cMm, I leave this to you,\u201d Wang Xian nodded and said to Director Sun. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Wang, you are too courteous. It\u2019s just a small matter. In that case, I shall not take up any more of your time,\u201d Director Sun replied immediately with a smile.\u201cWait a minute. That\u2026 How do I address you?\u201d An idea struck Wang Xian as he stopped Director Sun.\u201cYoung Master Wang, you can just call me Xiao Sun!\u201d When Director Sun heard Wang Xian stop him, he was thrilled.\u201cI\u2019ll just call you Director Sun. Director Sun, I have something to trouble you with.\u201d Wang Xian looked at him and smiled. \u201cThis is the father of my sister\u2019s classmate. He is currently working at a construction site. Help me keep a lookout if there are any suitable jobs for him.\u201d\u201cWork?\u201d Director Sun was taken aback. Following which, excitement flashed in his eyes. \u201cYes, there is, Young Master Wang. We are looking for a Security Department head and there are also many vacant slots in the Quality Inspection Department, which is recruiting. The salary isn\u2019t particularly high but is still around several tens of thousands a month,\u201d Director Sun remarked. He turned to the middle-aged man and said enthusiastically, \u201cBrother, come look for me! This is my name card, and can I get your number? I\u2019ll give you a call after lunch. At that time, I\u2019ll bring you over.\u201dThe middle-aged man was stunned. Looking at this well-dressed young man, he was at a loss as to what to do.Although the middle-aged man was from the village, he wasn\u2019t silly.He could roughly deduce the ability of this young man in front of him.The parents of the girl a while ago were just a small partner of his and they were already doing so well. Currently, this even more incredible person was being so enthusiastic to him. This had completely thrown him off.\u201cThis\u2026 Director Sun\u2026\u201d The middle-aged man stood up immediately. He looked at Wang Xian and waved his hand constantly. \u201cHey son, this wouldn\u2019t do. I know what I\u2019m capable of. It\u2019s alright if you want me to do some menial work. As for others, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, uncle. You can learn while doing. If you really can\u2019t, you are free to switch to a more ordinary job.\u201d Wang Xian stood up and patted the shoulder of the middle-aged man. He looked to Director Sun and said, \u201cDirector Sun, take down my number. If there\u2019s anything, you can call me directly. I\u2019ll contact you directly with regard to this uncle in the future.\u201d\u201cSure, sure.\u201d Director Sun nodded his head gladly and took out his phone.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s talk again after lunch.\u201d Wang Xian nodded at Director Sun.\u201cSure, sure. In that case, Young Master Wang, have your lunch first. We are going for lunch too.\u201d Director Sun nodded his head and smiled.Looking at the shocked look on the middle-aged man, he added, \u201cUncle, take a seat. It\u2019s just a small matter.\u201d\u201cSigh. Son, you are truly a great guy. Really! Thank you! I have to thank you!\u201d The middle-aged man was so moved that he became incoherent.\u201cIt\u2019s really a small matter. Uncle, you are a great guy and I was just helping you within my means.\u201dWang Xian shook his head and continued, \u201cLet\u2019s eat, let\u2019s eat. If you all are free in the future, ask Xiao Yu to bring you over. Don\u2019t stand on ceremony.\u201d\u201cThank you, senior,\u201d Yuan Yuanyuan replied gratefully.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. We are roommates and will be living together for four years. This is just a small matter!\u201dXiao Yu held on to Yuan Yuanyuan\u2019s arm and chuckled.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Qian\u2019s parents, who were sitting at the other end, looked at the young man in shock.Without having to do anything, there were people coming over to help eradicate that cocky family.With just a request, he could give the middle-aged man a job that many others desired.They were convinced that they should ask their daughter to be good friends with his sister.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Old Xue seldom called him. It was always Xue Jing who contacted him the most.\u201cHello, OId Xue!\u201dWang Xian picked up the phone and greeted doubtfully.\u201cWang Xian, are you busy?\u201d Old Xue\u2019s voice was heard on the phone.\u201cHur? What\u2019s the matter, Old Xue?\u201d asked Wang Xian curiously.\u201cThere is something that I would like to discuss with you. Old Qin is with me too. I wonder if you\u2019re free in the afternoon!\u201dWang Xian hesitated before he nodded, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll pop by!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send you the address, or I can get someone to pick you up.\u201d\u201cI can go over on my own. You can just send me the address!\u201d\u201cSure, see you later!\u201dWang Xian nodded and hung up. He glanced at Xiao Yu and the other two girls with a shrug of his shoulders.\u201cXiao Yu, I can\u2019t keep you company in the afternoon. I\u2019ve got something going on!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. It would be inconvenient for the three girls to follow you around too. Hehe. Besides, we can check out the school too,\u201d said Xiao Yu to Wang Xian with a smile.\u201cYou little one, go ahead and have fun. I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d Wang Xian patted her head and followed them to the school.He came to the back of the dormitory and rode on his Harley motorcycle before he headed to the place Old Xue sent him.\u201cWow, Xiao Yu. The Harley motorcycle that your brother is riding is so cool. Do you think I could stand a chance with him after I slim down?\u201dSu Qian looked at Wang Xian with affectionate eyes. She then looked at her plump figure with dissatisfaction.\u201cHehe, my brother seems to have a girlfriend. But if you slim down, I\u2019m sure you will be gorgeous.\u201d Xiao Yu chuckled as she spoke.\u201cYou\u2019re very kind,\u201d said Yuan Yuanyuan gratefully as she gazed at Wang Xian who had left and Xiao Yu who was right by her side.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. I wanted to get my brother to bring us out. But since he has something on, we can walk around and get some daily necessities. We should also decorate our room too.\u201d\u2026The address that Old Xue sent him was not Summer Sun Resort. It was another place.An area that was near the sea with many villas \u2013 Bamboo Forest Estate.When he reached it, Wang Xian made a call, and Xue Jing rushed over soon after.\u201cBrother Wang Xian, you\u2019re here. My grandfather and Old Qin are waiting for you!\u201d\u201cWhat did Old Xue and Old Qin ask me here for?\u201d Wang Xian asked Xue Jing curiously.Xue Jing paused before he said, \u201cShould be something to do with the underworld affairs!\u201d\u201cUnderworld affairs?\u201dXue Jing nodded slowly. There were two ecosystems in the current modern world \u2014 Society and underworld.Underworld was a place for people who possessed domineering powers.Wang Xian followed Xue Jing into the villa, which was surrounded by a bamboo forest. Along the path, he found a quiet stream with a small bridge that made a picturesque scene.From the wooden door, he entered into a courtyard where he could see some nostalgic and posh-looking houses.In the courtyard were some ponds with ornamental fish.Old Qin and Old Xue were sitting under a willow tree on the left, drinking their tea.\u201cWang Xian is here!\u201dBoth Old Xue and Old Qin smiled and greeted him as they saw him.\u201cSorry to keep both of you waiting.\u201dWang Xian smiled and sat on the seat beside them. Xue Jing was filling a cup of tea for him.\u201cI just arrived not long ago too.\u201d Old Qin smiled and shook his head, \u201cWe wanted to discuss something with you today. Hence, we invited you over.\u201d\u201cWhat is it about?\u201d Wang Xian took a sip of tea and asked.\u201cLet me explain.\u201d Old Xue straightened his posture with a solemn expression. \u201cIt has something to do with the underworld. Something has been brewing in the underworld these past two days. Those hidden clans and sects revealed themselves one after another. I\u2019m afraid there will be upheavals in the underworld soon.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Wang Xian expressed his curiosity, \u201cHidden clans? Hidden sects?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The number one Ancient Martial Arts Family in Rivertown, Yan Family, returned yesterday after staying out of underworld affairs for 20 years. The Lingluo Sect of the provincial city began their recruitment of disciples all of a sudden. Fierce battles broke out between the two sects in the north due to some cultivation treasures. A sect in the Eastern Sea announced that they will be expanding and recruiting more disciples. The Sacred Followers Guild began their recruitment too.\u201d Old Xue explained this slowly to him.\u201cYan Family? Disciples\u2019 recruitments?\u201d Wang Xian was deep in thought. \u201cWhy did these hidden clans and sects start their recruitments all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cBecause they wanted to compete for resources in advance.\u201d Old Xue frowned and continued, \u201cCurrently, the cultivation resources are lacking. It is even scarce when we\u2019re now in the modern era. These hidden clans needed more people to search for resources, tackle other living creatures, and refine medicines.\u201d\u201cOther living creatures?\u201d Wang Xian was stunned as he raised his eyebrows.\u201cYes, Wang Xian. You may not know these. Humans are not the only domineering ones on Earth. There are also other creatures around.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not go into the mysterious ocean. Numerous spirits and monsters lie in the mountains and rivers too. Creatures like sea monsters that lurk around various lakes and the well-known monsters in the mountains are all spirits and monsters!\u201d\u201cJust like Jianghai Lake in the Rivertown. I\u2019m sure you would have heard of all the tales about the sea monsters in Jianghai Lake.\u201dUpon hearing that, Wang Xian nodded his head gently. Jianghai Lake was a lake that connected to the sea. The lake was huge with a depth of 178 meters.He knew about the tales with regards to the sea monsters in Jianghai Lake, but he did not pay attention to it.\u201cThe tales about the water and sea monsters have always been around. But not all are rumors. They really exist. Currently, we\u2019re lacking cultivation resources. Hence, we need to find other ways to them. Just recently, someone caught some powerful creatures to enhance their own strength, and the effect was significant.\u201d\u201cCurrently, various Ancient Martial Artist Families surfaced just to compete for these resources. The underworld will be greeted with bloodshed and brutal fights again. At that time, not only the hidden Ancient Martial Artist Families will be involved, but ancient sects might also join in too.\u201dWang Xian listened quietly to the conversation between Old Qin and Old Xue. From the conversation, he had a deeper understanding of the cultivation techniques of the various clans and sects in this world.Currently, not only the ancient martial arts existed, but there were also ancient yoga, Ninjutsu, western Bloodline Art, and Beast Transformation Art.But, in actual fact, all Cultivation Arts may seem different, but they were similar to each other. Towards the later stages of the cultivation, all the goals of the cultivations were the same.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWang Xian not only learned about the Cultivation Arts, but he also found out a lot of anecdotes about the underworld\u2019s mountain spirits and sea monsters.That\u2019s interesting. Sea Monsters? Currently, my cultivation speed is too slow. Perhaps I can devour them or recruit some sea monsters to build up the Dragon Palace as soon as possible!Wang Xian pondered to himself. He was not concerned about those hidden clans which surfaced in the underworld again. He trusted himself.And the Dragon Sect which was developing rapidly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he felt that Old Qin and Old Xue were nice people and worthy friends.Otherwise, with his current strength and the powers of the Dragon Sect, it wasn\u2019t necessary for him to ally with them.When he walked out of the meeting with Old Qin and Old Xue, it was already 8 pm. Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before heading towards the sea.He hadn\u2019t been back for a few days and was wondering about the progress of the establishment of Dragon Sect.At the seaside, Wang Xian removed his clothes and easily jumped out over 10 meters.Splash!After letting out a light roar, Wang Xian transformed into a five-meters long divine dragon.Five Elements Divine Dragon with five different colors. Wiggling his body, Wang Xian swam towards the island in the middle of the sea at an incredible speed.Executing water controlling techniques along the way, he arrived at the island 5 kilometers away in a single minute.Eh? There\u2019re quite a number of boats around.Wang Xian noticed a few boats around the island. The island was brightly lit and he could see some figures moving on the island.With a thought, an invisible Dragon Power spread towards the island.Swoosh swoosh swoosh!Soon, several figures descended by the seaside.\u201cDragon King!\u201d\u201cDragon King!\u201dMo Qinglong and his disciple, together with all the Dragonians, rushed over and kneeled down in front of Wang Xian with respect.\u201cMartial Artist Level Six. Not bad. To be able to reach Level Six in such a short time.\u201dWang Xian looked towards the group of Dragonians before turning his attention to Mo Qinglong and his disciple.Mo Qinglong had already reached the Inborn Realm and his disciple had reached Martial Artist Level Eight.\u201cWhat\u2019s the progress of establishing Dragon Sect?\u201d Wang Xian looked at the Island and asked.\u201cDragon King, we are right on track. In just about another month, Dragon Sect will be established. At that time, our might will definitely spread through the world!\u201d Mo Qinglong\u2019s eyes lit up as he reported.\u201cGreat. Cultivate diligently!\u201dWang Dahai nodded his head. Flipping backward, he dove back into the sea.\u201cSending off the Dragon King!\u201d The group of Dragonians kneeled down and shouted in unison.Wang Xian went over to the Clam girl.Clam girl opened her shell slowly and revealed her human form. She immediately greeted him.Wang Xian nodded his head before devouring the marine animals in the sea.\u201cBohai Sea is too shallow. The variety of fish is too limited!\u201dAfter devouring a small shark, Wang Xian sighed emotionally.Currently, he was about 80 kilometers from land. However, the seas were only about 18 meters deep. There were barely any schools of fish around.As compared to the other sea regions where the depth of water could reach over a thousand meters, Bohai Sea was too shallow.If he wished to increase his level, Bohai Sea would be hard to satisfy his desire.To increase my level, it would be more effective to look for higher Level marine animals. Higher Level\u2026Wang Xian pondered. Suddenly, a place appeared in his mind.Jianghai Lake.There was a rumor about a huge sea monster in Jianghai Lake four years ago. Some people reported seeing a huge sea monster that resembled a grinding disc.It had a huge oval-shaped body. Some people caught it in a photograph where one could vaguely see a monster larger than boats surfacing from the water.However, as the distance was too far, some said that it wasn\u2019t a sea monster but just some reflections.There were also people speculating that it should be some giant sharks or similar marine animals that had swam into Jianghai Lake.Everyone had their own explanations and this even attracted a group of researchers. They conducted a search of the entire Jianghai Lake but didn\u2019t detect any ginormous animal.Therefore, this ended without a conclusive answer.However, the rumors of a sea monster in Jianghai Lake didn\u2019t just stop there. There were still people claiming to encounter the sea monster from time to time.However, none had concrete evidence and no one had seen how the sea monster really looks.Old Qin and Old Xue talked about the sea monster of Jianghai Lake today. In that case, there might really be a powerful sea monster.Wang Xian thought. Based on his impression, he swam quickly towards where Jianghai Lake was located.Jianghai Lake was connected to the Bohai Sea. However, since it was deep between the lands, many simply referred to it as Jianghai Lake.Jianghai Lake covered an area of approximately 20 kilometers.After passing through an entrance of over 100 meters in length and 40-50 meters in breadth, Wang Xian entered Jianghai Lake.Who would have expected Jianghai Lake to be deeper than Bohai Sea? It\u2019s at least 20 meters deep here.Wang Xian was slightly shocked. The waters of Jianghai Lake were a little murky. Moving his body, he dove in directly.The dragon energy I needed for cultivation is too high now. Ordinary fish don\u2019t provide sufficient dragon energy. If there\u2019re higher Level marine animals, my cultivation speed would also be quicker.Wang Xian thought. Swaying his tail, he swam towards the middle.The distance of 20 kilometers wasn\u2019t far from Wang Xian. He swam to the middle and started observing the surroundings.There were few marine animals around. This was a little strange for a lake so huge.A golden light shot out from Wang Xian\u2019s eyes as he looked at the surroundings carefully.He swam in the vicinity while searching, but couldn\u2019t find anything unusual.Eh? How can there be nothing? If it is like what the people on the Internet have said, the sea monster should be at least 10 meters long. I should be able to find it.Wang Xian\u2019s eyebrows knitted together but he continued swaying his tail slowly.Growl!A dragon roar resounded in the Jianghai Lake. Wang Xian released all his aura to announce his arrival at Jianghai Lake.The current Wang Xian could spread his dragon power to cover a radius of 2 kilometers. All the marine animals within the area were shivering and didn\u2019t dare to budge an inch.The water of Jianghai Lake was ravaged without cause.Growl!Wang Xian swam to another person and let out another roar. His dragon roar resounded throughout the entire Jianghai Lake.Swish!At this moment, Wang Xian could sense something to his back.He immediately turned over and stared at the bottom of the lake.Indeed! The sea monster truly exists!Wang Xian looked forward and in the direction he was facing, a huge animal was floating up gradually.It seemed to have been lying on the bottom of the water with its entire body sunk into the mud.As he floated upwards slowly, the mud on his body slowly fell off.The image of the giant shell became clearer and clearer to Wang Xian. On the shell, there were small sharp edges that looked like it was made from mud.So big, so big!At the front of the large shell that spanned at least 10 meters, a head slowly extended out.His head was black and had sharp edges on it. Although its eyes were black, it had a glow that could be seen through the water in the middle of the night.Rawwr! \u201cWho are you?\u201dHe opened his mouth and let out a roar, showing creepy-looking teeth. He looked directly at Wang Xian.It has intelligence!When Wang Xian heard this dinosaur-like turtle\u2019s growl, he was slightly shocked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSpiritual Turtle: Level 10Extractable Dragon Energy: 123,272A Level 10 Spiritual Turtle?

I\u2019m the Turtle Ancestor. You\u2019re just a mere Dragon King, and you have the cheek to ask me to succumb to you? Ignorant!\u201dThe spiritual turtle had a high intelligence as he stared coldly at Wang Xian with a tilting head. His eyes had a disdainful look in them.Even though he could sense the domineering strength from the odd creature in front of him, he was not afraid as his physical size was larger than it.Besides, he had lived for thousands of years. As the ancestor of the turtles, how could he succumb to anyone?\u201cTurtle ancestor?\u201dWang Xian was a little stunned when he heard the spiritual turtle calling himself the Turtle Ancestor. It was unexpected for him to encounter a cocky spiritual turtle.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re choosing the second alternative.\u201dWang Xian swung his tail gently as he gazed at the gigantic spiritual turtle.\u201cCourting your own death. Since you interrupted my sleep, I\u2019ll eat you up.\u201dThe spiritual turtle opened his mouth wide as he attacked Wang Xian without any fear.He shook his body, and the mud around the area spread out. The entire region turned murky, and the visibility dropped.\u201cEarth Control?\u201dOnce again, Wang Xian displayed a surprised look when he saw the fluctuation in the surrounding earth.This was the most formidable marine animal that he had ever encountered. Not only did the creature have intelligence, it even had Superpower.\u201cI know Earth Control too!\u201dWang Xian displayed a cold smile on his face. He slightly wriggled his body, and the soil in the murky sea was filtered from the water. The soil then gathered and formed into a ball of dirt.When the surrounding water was cleared, Wang Xian saw the spiritual turtle, which had swum to a location within five meters away from him. A smirk surfaced on his face.\u201cEarthy Thorn!\u201dEarthy Thorn was a simple technique in his Earth Control Arts. The current Wang Xian was still too weak, and he had yet to master his control of the Five Elements.If he grew stronger, he could control all the surrounding earth and bury everything around it.\u201cYou can control the earth too.\u201dThe Spiritual Turtle was taken aback when he saw the incoming Earthy Thorn. However, there was no fear in him as he lowered his head slowly.Bam!The Earthy Thorn landed on the durable shell of the Spiritual Turtle, leaving no trace on it.\u201cGo to hell!\u201dThe Spiritual Turtle suddenly accelerated as he opened his enormous mouth to bite Wang Xian.Upon seeing the dense and sharp teeth in his mouth, Wang Xian knew that he could bite off a piece of meat from him if he were caught in it.\u201cGo and die!\u201dWang Xian looked at the Spiritual Turtle with a disdainful look in his eyes. Even though he was only Level Six, he had no fear when confronted by creatures who were of Inborn levels.As a Five Elements Divine Dragon, Level-ten marine animals could not pose any threat to him.\u201cMetal counters Wood, Wood counters Earth, Earth counters Fire and Fire counters Metal!\u201dThe five elements reinforce and counteract each other. The colors on Wang Xian\u2019s body changed and turned green eventually.The Azure Dragon with Wood attribution can counteract all Earth in the world!Wang Xian stretched out his dragon claws with thistles and thorns slithering and twining themselves around the mouth of the Spiritual Turtle.Roar!Wang Xian let out a dragon roar while exhaling a gush of green breath.As the green breath hit the aquatic plants in the surrounding area, the plants began to shoot up frantically.The water plants entangled themselves to form ropes. They slid towards the Spiritual Turtle and entwined the Spiritual Turtle.In an instant, the Spiritual Turtle was trapped within the woody field which spanned across a radius of 20 meters.\u201cSuch a powerful Five-elements reinforcement!\u201dLooking at the woody field that he created, Wang Xian was rather surprised.When he was in the human form, he was five times weaker than he was in dragon form. Hence, he was unable to create such a powerful woody field.Moreover, he was unable to interchange the five elements when he was in human form. Hence, he was even weaker, and his combat skill would be weaker by 10 folds.\u201cLet me go, let me go!\u201dThe Spiritual Turtle struggled violently, but he realized that the seaweed around him was not giving way except to tighten its grip on him.Besides, the counteract of the five elements made it even more difficult for the Spiritual Turtle, with a heavy body, to break free.\u201cTurtle meat makes a great tonic. Heh heh, I\u2019ll chop off your limbs and barbecue them. Then, I\u2019ll cook your head for the soup. Hehe!\u201d\u201cOh\u2026no. The head cannot be used for the soup. I\u2019ll throw it away. Heh heh!\u201dWang Xian revealed his creepy teeth as he observed the turtle with a thought in his mind.\u201cI\u2019ll surrender to you. Don\u2019t kill me. Spare my life, Great King!\u201dThe Spiritual Turtle hid his head in his gigantic shell with eyes full of fear as he pleaded.\u201cJust now, I asked you to surrender to me. You refused. Now, you\u2019re surrendering to me because you can\u2019t win against me?\u201dWang Xian stared coldly.\u201cGreat King, I\u2019ll give all the treasures that I\u2019ve collected to you. Please spare my life!\u201d said the Spiritual Turtle hurriedly.\u201cTreasures? What treasures? \u201cWang Xian quickly asked with eyes brightened up.\u201cI\u2019ll get them for you. But please, don\u2019t kill me!\u201d\u201cFine, don\u2019t think of running away. I can easily kill you.\u201dWang Xian nodded. He was not afraid that the Spiritual Turtle would escape. With a thought, the surrounding seaweed retracted rapidly and turned into ordinary seaweed again.With a pair of wary eyes, the Spiritual Turtle looked at Wang Xian before he swam to the back.Wang Xian followed him and came to the place where he\u2019d been just now.Ka Ka Ka!The Spiritual Turtle came to the place where he\u2019d been and manipulated the earth below him. As he did that, individual items began to surface and float up.\u201cHur? What are all these things?\u201dWang Xian looked at the floating things that resembled turtle shells with shock.\u201cTrophies, King. These are my trophies. Those little turtles who fought with me were all killed by me. These are their shells.\u201dThe Spiritual Turtle shifted his gigantic body as he spoke.\u201cPervert!\u201dWang Xian looked at the pile of turtle shells beside him and blew his dragon beard.Among these turtle shells, there was one that was about five meters in size. It must have been a formidable one before it was slaughtered by this Spiritual Turtle, unfortunately.\u201cKing, I\u2019m formidable!\u201d the Spiritual Turtle said proudly.\u201cFine. I have no interest in your trophies. Swallow this blood essence and do not think of resisting!\u201dWang Xian moved his claw, and a drop of Dragon Blood entered the Spiritual Turtle\u2019s mouth.The Dragon Blood was no longer gold in color. Instead, it was five different colors.The Spiritual Turtle closed his eyes without putting up any resistance.\u201cIt\u2019s done. From now on, you\u2019ll be the Prime Minister Turtle of the Dragon Palace!\u201dThe moment Wang Xian spotted such an enormous Spiritual Turtle, he had already made up his mind.The Dragon Palace needed a Prime Minister Turtle!Ding.\u201cYou\u2019ve subdued three marine animals and fulfilled the criteria for constructing the Dragon Palace.\u201d\u201cLevel-one Dragon Palace can be established deep in the seabed with resistance to floods and fires. It will form a region of its own. The required materials to build one: 100 tons of gold, 100,000 tons of silver, 1 million of brass, 10,000 of refined iron, 1 million of coral reef, one ton each for gemstones with five different colors and one ton of spiritual stones.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt this moment, the system notification sounded off, which made him freeze.He seldom heard the system notification apart from the beginning where he had just become a dragon. Now, the system actually prompted him about the Dragon Palace.Initially, Wang Xian thought he needed to build his Dragon Palace by mastering the Divine Dragon Transformation. Never did he expect that the system was building it for him.Surprise!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - Wang DahaiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98: Wang DahaiLarbrestudioIt seems like the system still has a lot of functions that aren\u2019t unlocked and only would be when I\u2019ve reached a certain level.Wang Xian\u2019s eyes flickered.Name: Wang XianRace: Five Elements Divine Dragon (Able to transform into a human)Level: SixDragon Energy: 563,421/100,000,000Superpower: Dominate the marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animals that are lower than your own level)Devour any form of marine animals (For extraction of dragon energy)Five Elements ControlArt of Cultivation: Divine Dragon TransformationLevel One Dragon Palace: Not built (Required Materials: 0/100)Dragon Palace Subordinates: Turtle Race (1); Clam Race (1) Lobster Race (1)It has changed! My personal information has changed!There are additional line items of \u201cDragon Palace\u201d and \u201cDragon Palace Subordinates\u201d.Divine dragons exist in this universe. However, I\u2019m not just an ordinary divine dragon, but also possess a god-like Divine Dragon System. The cultivation of Divine Dragons couldn\u2019t extract divine energy by devouring marine animals. Instead, they have to cultivate diligently. As for me, due to the system, I could make use of the system to convert them directly into dragon energy. As compared to the divine dragon race, there\u2019s a huge difference!Similarly, I could build the strongest Dragon Palace directly through the system!Wang Xian\u2019s eyes flickered. Divine Dragon System was relatively more unique. It couldn\u2019t make one become an unparalleled Divine Dragon directly, and required that he take one step at a time.The focus of Invincible Divine Dragon Cultivation System was in cultivation!Only by going through each step could he become an invincible divine dragon.One should know that the strongest races of the universe weren\u2019t just the dragon race.However, he could make use of the system to become an invincible existence!\u201cBut!\u201d Wang Xian had a million thoughts running in his mind. In the end, he had a bitter look on his face and couldn\u2019t help but curse. \u201cIsn\u2019t the material required to build the Dragon Palace a little too much?\u201dDisregarding others, just a hundred tons of gold would be an astronomical sum.A hundred tons of gold would be 100 million grams. Taking the price of gold to be $330 be gram, he would need $33 billion.The $33 billion was even before he considered other materials. The total sum required to build a dragon palace would be astronomical.Wang Xian\u2019s expression darkened. He couldn\u2019t even take out a hundred million currently, let alone $30 billion.\u201cPoor, I\u2019m still too poor.\u201dWang Xian pulled a long face and took a deep breath. \u201cThis is forcing me to rule the world so as to look for the resources!\u201d\u201cForget it. I might not need to rule the world but I do need to earn some money. Once I have the money, the gold and other materials could be bought. It is just that spiritual stone wouldn\u2019t be easy to get!\u201dSpiritual stone was a condensed form of pure energy. However, he hadn\u2019t seen one previously. Therefore, it was most likely very valuable.Wang Xian shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He wanted to take this step by step, as it hadn\u2019t even been a month since he became a divine dragon.The money would come and so would the Dragon Palace.\u201cKing!\u201dAt this moment, the spiritual turtle disrupted Wang Xian\u2019s thoughts.Wang Xian looked at the spiritual turtle. The spiritual turtle was drastically different from when he first saw it.Its shell looked a little sturdier and wasn\u2019t like the ground beetle previously. It even looked rather majestic.\u201cNot bad, not bad. I\u2019ll call you Prime Minister Turtle in the future. Don\u2019t address me as King. Call me \u2018Dragon King!'\u201d\u201cYes, Dragon King. Prime Minister Turtle thanks Dragon King for the name!\u201d\u201cSure, sure!\u201dWang Xian looked at Prime Minister Turtle with satisfaction. Although its current appearance wasn\u2019t great, it was highly intelligent. A Prime Minister Turtle that doesn\u2019t know how to bootlick isn\u2019t a good Prime Minister Turtle!\u201cWhy don\u2019t you head into the seas? Why do you choose to stay in this lake?\u201d Wang Xian asked peculiarly.\u201cIt\u2019s more comfortable here and I won\u2019t be disturbed!\u201d Prime Minister Turtle answered honestly.\u201cAlright.\u201dWang Xian was a little speechless. Waving his arm, the Earth Dragon Cultivation Arts of the Divine Dragon Transformation was imprinted in his mind.\u201cCultivate diligently here. I\u2019ll make my move now.\u201dAfter finishing his words, Wang Xian headed out immediately.Time flew past quickly, and he had to return.He had a fruitful night. Not only did he manage to subdue a Prime Minister Turtle but he had also gotten an idea of the process of building his Dragon Palace.However, no one would have imagined that the sea monster of Jianghai Lake was actually a large and horrifying turtle that spanned over 10 meters.When he arrived at school from the seaside, it was already past 9 am.Just as he stepped into the dormitory room, a rough voice sounded.\u201cWhat the\u2026 Old Wang, you are finally back. I called you so many times but you didn\u2019t pick up. Come, accompany me to buy some clothes today.\u201dWang Xian lifted his head and immediately saw a fat head extending out of the bed.\u201cDahai, why are you so early? What a rare occasion!\u201dWang Dahai had the same surname as him and was a year older than Wang Xian. He weighed around 190 catties.He had all the strengths of a fatty such as being honest, upright, and conservative on the outside but passionate on the inside. He was the closest friend Wang Xian had in the dormitory.Wang Dahai was a local of Rivertown. Typically, he wouldn\u2019t report to school before school started. It would seem that he had arrived the previous day and was acting a little strange.\u201cI have something in mind, hehe.\u201d Wang Dahai chuckled.Looking at his horny look, it must be related to a girl!\u201cOld Wang, I\u2019ll get up right now. Accompany me to buy some clothes!\u201d Wang Dahai stood up as he spoke.Speaking of Wang Xian\u2019s nickname, \u201cOld Wang,\u201d there was a meaning behind it.The story was from the beginning of freshman year. At that time, there was a guy from the opposite dormitory block who liked a girl from their class.However, that girl was more interested in Wang Xian.After that guy confessed and got rejected, Wang Xian got another nickname, \u201cOld Wang, the Neighbour\u201d or in short, \u201cOld Wang.\u201d [1] Almost everyone in the dormitory addressed him as such.\u201cBuy clothes? I have to accompany my sister today. My sister has arrived.\u201d Wang Xian chuckled.\u201cYour sister, Xiao Yu, has arrived?\u201d Wang Dahai was a little surprised. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ask your sister, Xiao Yu, along?\u201d\u201cLet me ask her about it.\u201d Wang Xian didn\u2019t reject the suggestion.Wang Dahai was a great guy and had been taking good care of him. He had treated Wang Xian to multiple meals and even lent Wang Xian his motorcycle over the summer holidays.After getting Wang Xian\u2019s call, Xiao Yu replied, \u201cBrother, I\u2019m going to take a look at the school clubs with Xiao Mi, Yuanyuan and Su Qian. I guess I won\u2019t be going.\u201dWang Xian nodded his hand. \u201cAlright, have fun. I\u2019ll accompany my roommate to get some stuff.\u201d\u201cGive me a moment to wash up!\u201dUpon hearing Wang Xian\u2019s words, Wang Dahai immediately jumped up and started washing up.\u201cWhere are we going to get clothes?\u201d Wang Xian asked.\u201cCity center!\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to go to the city center to get clothes. Can\u2019t you just get them from the shops beside the school? Oh right, you haven\u2019t told me why you arrived at school so early?\u201dWang Xian looked at Wang Dahai.Hehe! Wang Dahai chuckled. He stuck his head out of the washroom and said, \u201cLet me bring you to have some fun tonight.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026 You got a date? Is she from our school?\u201d Wang Xian asked in shock.\u201cShe\u2019s a senior. Hehe, it was initially last night but she went out with her roommates for dinner. Therefore, it was postponed to tonight. Old Wang, you are lucky.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDamn, why does it feel like you\u2019ve gotten more handsome since the last time I saw you a month ago. If only you were a little uglier. You would then be able to show how tall and mighty I am.\u201d\u201cSigh. It\u2019s okay, who asked me to be so kind? She said she would be bringing her roommates along. Perhaps they might find you handsome and have a relationship that lasts for a single night with you.\u201dEndnote:\u201cOld Wang, the Neighbour\u201d was a comic strip character. He took on many roles, among which was a guy who got into an affair with the neighbor\u2019s wife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After bathing, Wang Dahai changed his clothes and made a few poses in front of the mirror.\u201cNot bad. Even though I\u2019m slightly plump, my features are perfect, giving off a sense of security.\u201dWang Dahai looked into the mirror as he was satisfied with his look.\u201cWill this work this time? Don\u2019t get disappointed again!\u201dWang Xian looked at him and chucked. Wang Dahai had an experience of dating a girl from the internet. In the end, the petite girl left after seeing him.\u201cThere\u2019s hope this time! I\u2019m sure!\u201dWang Dahai\u2019s eyes brightened up. \u201cI met this girl before. So, I\u2019m not afraid that she will run away after she sees me.\u201d\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go!\u201dWang Xian laughed as he went down with Wang Dahai.\u201cGive me the keys. I\u2019ll drive you!\u201d Wang Dahai told Wang Xian.\u201cEh, your motorcycle was damaged by me. So, I bought another one!\u201d Wang Xian smiled and said.\u201cDamaged?\u201dWang Dahai was stunned and shouted at him, \u201cIf you\u2019ve damage it, just let it be. Why do you still have to buy another one? Look, you should have told me earlier. I have two at home. Why did you have to buy one?!\u201dWang Xian felt warm in his heart. Wang Dahai said these things because he knew about his family situation.Wang Dahai\u2019s family was so-so and was considered to be middle class. They were not of high status, but neither were they poor. With a sum of $3,000 monthly allowance, it was considered an average amount.\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll show you a new bike.\u201dWang Xian arched his lips slightly as he brought him to the back of the dormitory.\u201cWow, Harley. It\u2019s the Harley motorcycle. This is my dream heavy duty motorcycle. I\u2019ll get one when I\u2019m rich!\u201dWang Dahai brightened his eyes as he stared at the Harley motorcycle with an envious look as soon as he was at the back.With a face full of smiles, Wang Xian took the keys and walked up. \u201cDo you want to try?\u201d\u201cSigh, I can only look at it. This Harley costs at least a few hundred thousand. I wonder who the rich guy is who put it here. Envy\u2026 If tonight\u2026\u201dWang Dahai was talking with a face full of regrets. However, his face stiffened up as he spoke.He saw Wang Xian take out the key, unlock the bike, and push it out.\u201cGosh! Old Wang! Brother Xian! This\u2026this\u2026\u201dWang Dahai looked at Wang Xian with astonished expressions.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Look at my dressing. Don\u2019t I deserve this bike?\u201dWang Xian smiled and pointed to his clothes as he put on the flashy sunglasses kept in the motorcycle.\u201cGivenchy. Givenchy\u2019s clothes! It\u2019s authentic. Old Wang, did you win some lottery?!\u201dWang Dahai had just noticed the brand on Wang Xian\u2019s clothes. He jumped immediately, shocked.\u201cThere is one thing that I have never told you. I\u2019m actually an affluent second generation in disguise. I can inherit the family\u2019s assets now since I\u2019ve turned 20.\u201dWang Xian joked with a smiling face.\u201cReally? Didn\u2019t you have only one sister? \u201cWang Dahai seemed to buy his words as he looked at him.\u201cLet\u2019s go. You just have to know that I\u2019m not a pauper anymore.\u201dWang Xian beckoned him and asked him to sit at the back seat.\u201cGosh, this is so cool! \u201cWang Dahai rubbed his palms together as he got excited. \u201cCan I try it too?\u201d\u201cYou can ride around the school. But you can forget about riding it in the city center. You don\u2019t have a license!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. But you got to let me enjoy it during the normal days!\u201d\u201cGet lost, enjoy my ass!\u201d\u201cBrother Xian, you\u2019ll be the big brother from now on. I\u2019m Xiao Hai!\u201dWang Xian started the engine and rode to the city center with Wang Dahai.As soon as Wang Dahai entered the mall, he began to shop.The reserved Wang Dahai even bought a pair of golden rimless glasses. What a flashy look!Wang Xian looked at him speechlessly. \u201cLooks like you really took a fancy to the girl tonight!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s the true love of my life. Brother Xian, tonight is the night!\u201d Wang Dahai patted Wang Xian on his shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s still early now. Where are we going?\u201d Wang Xian looked at the time.\u201cLet\u2019s go back. I want to dress myself up, then recharge myself in an internet cafe!\u201dWang Dahai was full of fighting spirit.Wang Xian followed Wang Dahai back to the dormitory helplessly. After they rested for a while, they came to the internet cafe.In the evening, Wang Dahai called the girl, but the girl asked him to wait.Wang Xian asked if the other party would stand him up tonight.Wang Dahai patted his chest and said she would never do that. In fact, the later they met, the better.Wang Xian could not figure out his train of thought. But when it was 8 pm, the girl called him.\u201cLet\u2019s meet at the school entrance!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. Haha. 8 pm! Let\u2019s have fun tonight!\u201dWang Dahai had shiny hair with exhilarating expressions all over his face.\u201cIt\u2019s so late. Where are we going at such an hour?\u201d asked Wang Xian speechlessly.\u201cThe pub, of course.\u201dWang Dahai raised his eyebrows. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll take the Harley motorcycle, and the remaining three ladies can take a cab.\u201d\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go!\u201dAs Wang Xian arrived at the entrance with Wang Dahai on the bike, the three trendy-looking girls were standing there.The three girls were all in mini-skirts. One of them even wore a pair of black stockings.Temptations in the air.\u201cRongrong, this is my roommate, Wang Xian. We\u2019re heading to the place on our bike. The three of you will share a cab. Is that okay?\u201dHe spoke with a smile. As soon as Wang Dahai saw them, he hopped off the bike before he came to a girl whose face was round.\u201cSure, then I\u2019ll see you at the pub.\u201d\u201cSure, I\u2019ll get you a cab before we leave!\u201d said Wang Dahai with smiles all over his face as he acted like a gentleman.The other two girls next to them observed Wang Dahai before they turned and looked at Wang Xian, who was on the bike.\u201cIt\u2019s here. Three beautiful ladies, you may leave first. We\u2019ll wait for you at the entrance.\u201dAs soon as the cab arrived, Wang Dahai spoke with a smile.\u201cSure, we\u2019ll meet you at the pub entrance.\u201d The girl named Rongrong waved to him as she sat inside.\u201cRongrong, is he Wang Dahai? He\u2019s fat. But his roommate is quite handsome!\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s him. I turned him down yesterday. But he kept pestering me to hang out with him. Since we\u2019ve got nothing going on today, let\u2019s go out and get high!\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s enjoy ourselves today. I saw them riding the Harley motorcycle. They should be quite loaded. Let\u2019s have a feast today!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling all of you in advance.

You look just like a bull that\u2019s in heat!\u201dLooking at Wang Dahai, Wang Xian found it hilarious.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand. This is true love. If you encounter the girl you really like, you would be the same as me. Rongrong is the cutest girl I\u2019ve ever seen. I definitely want her to be my girlfriend.\u201dWang Dahai spoke resolutely.Wang Xian was taken aback. This was still the first time he had seen Wang Dahai being so serious about chasing after a girl. He patted him on the shoulder and encouraged, \u201cAll the best!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s here, she\u2019s here!\u201d Wang Dahai saw them walk out from a rented car and quickly went up to receive them.When Rongrong saw Wang Dahai, she spoke with a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We can reserve a table for the five of us to chat and drink!\u201d\u201cSure, let\u2019s go in.\u201dWang Dahai nodded his head and the group of five walked towards the bar.Once they entered the bar, deafening music overwhelmed their ears.Wang Xian\u2019s eyebrows knitted together. This was the first time he\u2019d visited a bar and wasn\u2019t used to such an atmosphere.Looking towards the dancing platform, he saw a group of young men and women fooling around.Some were even grinding on each other. Under the faint and shimmering lights, there was a sense of vileness filling the atmosphere.Wang Xian looked at Wang Dahai and noticed that he was also frowning.The three girls seemed to be familiar with the place as they walked towards a long table. Immediately, the waiter walked over.\u201cGirls, which set meal would you like to have?\u201d the waiter asked as he handed over a price list to the three girls.Rongrong took a look at the price list before ordering. \u201cThe $1,888 set meal. Besides that, we want two bottles of Chivas Regal!\u201d [1]\u201cAlright, please wait a moment.\u201dWang Dahai and Wang Xian sat down. When he saw the prices on the price list, he frowned.\u201cDahai, a $1,888 set meal with two bottles of Chivas Regal of $400. That\u2019s already more than $2,600!\u201d\u201c$2,600?\u201d Wang Dahai put aside the price list and whispered, \u201cOld Wang, since I\u2019m here, I\u2019ve made preparations. If I don\u2019t spend this, how could I get the girl?\u201d\u201cAlright then, all the best!\u201dWang Xian smiled and patted his shoulders.\u201cCome, Rongrong. I had not expected your roommates to all be so beautiful!\u201dWang Dahai quickly started flirting. As for Wang Xian, he simply sat quietly and observed.The waiter quickly brought over the alcohol, fruits, and nuts. Wang Xian took a bottle of alcohol and poured some for himself.After trying a mouthful, he put it down.Fake alcohol!\u201cHandsome, are you from the same class as Wang Dahai?\u201dJust as Wang Xian was feeling bored and looking around, a girl sat beside him.The girl had a good figure but her face was a little long. She gave off a \u201cvixen\u201d vibe and could be considered as good looking overall.\u201cYeah.\u201d Wang Xian nodded his head before looking toward Wang Dahai. \u201cHey pretty, do you think Dahai has a chance with Rongrong?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The girl thought for a while before continuing, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you finish two more cups.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders helplessly and gulped down two cups of alcohol. \u201cI believe you can tell me now?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about it. Haha. If Wang Dahai works hard, he might have a chance!\u201dWang Xian was speechless upon hearing her reply. It was equivalent to not saying anything.\u201cCome handsome, let\u2019s have a toast!\u201dThat girl leaned over and had half of her body on Wang Xian. At this moment, Wang Xian could even smell her perfume.Wang Xian frowned, \u201cI\u2019m not good with alcohol.\u201d\u201cJust have a little. Oh right, handsome! Do you have a girlfriend?\u201d the girl asked directly.\u201cYeah.\u201d Wang Xian hesitated for a while. \u201cI do.\u201d\u201cHuh? You have a girlfriend? Do you mind changing one?\u201d The girl looked at him with her pair of large eyes and even blinked flirtatiously at him.Looking at the girl, Wang Xian felt as though he was a weak little lamb.The other party had ample experiences with flirting. Although Wang Xian was being picked up by the girl, he wasn\u2019t feeling happy at all.The girl in front of him couldn\u2019t be compared with Guan Shuqing or Lan Qingyue at all. She was just like a prostitute to Wang Xian.Shameless and revealing!Wang Xian wasn\u2019t too interested in continuing chatting, and simply said a few perfunctory words in response.That girl saw how Wang Xian acted and started frowning. Contempt flashed in her eyes and she went back to her previous seat beside the other girl directly.At about 10 pm, Wang Dahai said to Wang Xian, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the bathroom, Old Wang!\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dWang Xian nodded his head and followed him to the bathroom.The girls behind them took a look at them but soon went back to playing among themselves.\u201cHow was it?\u201dEntering the washroom, Wang Xian glanced at Wang Dahai and asked.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wang Dahai frowned. \u201cRongrong is pretty good, but\u2026 But\u2026\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel like a student and was very open?\u201d Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and added.\u201cYeah!\u201d Wang Dahai didn\u2019t know how to describe it and simply nodded his head.For a female university student to be so open in such a place, it was clear that she was a frequent patron. This made Wang Dahai, who was a little chauvinistic, a little uncomfortable.\u201cThat\u2019s how I felt too. Dahai, you\u2019ve got to think about it!\u201d\u201cI know. Let\u2019s see how it goes. It was very comfortable to chat with her,\u201d Wang Dahai replied after thinking for a moment.\u201cMm!\u201dWang Dahai took out a cigarette to smoke. After he was done, he signaled to Wang Xian to return.The two of them walked towards their seats. There were a lot more people at the bar than when they had arrived. This was natural, as the nightlife had just started after 10 pm.\u201cHuh?\u201dTo their surprise, they saw four other men when they were back at their seats.These four young men were sitting in their seats and chatting happily with the three girls.On the table, there were five bottles of imported wine and over 20 bottles of beer.Wang Xian and Wang Dahai exchanged gazes before finding another place to sit.\u201cCome Dahai, let me introduce them to you. This is Lingling\u2019s boyfriend and our friends. We happened to bump into them so I asked them over. It\u2019s livelier with more people!\u201dRongrong moved towards Wang Dahai and spoke to him with smiles.\u201cRongrong, is this the handsome guy who is wooing you? He\u2019s not as handsome as me!\u201d A young man beside Rongrong took a glance at Wang Dahai and chuckled.\u201cYou are handsome?\u201d Rongrong rolled her eyes at him.\u201cAm I not?\u201d The young man leaned over towards Rongrong.\u201cScram!
