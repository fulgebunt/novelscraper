    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1Side 1Translated by NaralaraEdited by NaralaraSometimes there were days like this.A day where he can\u2019t completely fill the gap he was born with.It starts with very little things.The smell of the guy in the front seat who pretended to be friendly this morning, the old man dragging five puppies slowly traversing the front of the car, or the voluptuous teeth of a pig-like bastard who purposely bumped into him while exercising.Things he wouldn\u2019t normally notice slipped through the cracks and gnawed at his nerves. Every now and then, an impulse arose.Impulses such as sticking the pen in the front seater\u2019s eyeballs, ignoring the old man walking like a snail and stepping on the accelerator, or pulling out all the teeth of the guy in front of him.He glanced at the face reflected in the hallway window. His face was so normal that it was hard to believe that he was someone who had only had terrible dreams.No, saying it was fine was not enough. It was close. He stood out even among his peers.The dark hair and eyes that lightly covered his forehead made him feel special rather than different. He was a quarterback on the football team and his grades were excellent, so he had to choose which university to go to. Anyone who knew the price of his sports car could easily guess how wealthy his parents were. All the girls at school wanted to talk to him.Every time he walked, people\u2019s eyes moved. A girl standing across the hallway greeted him, but he passed by pretending not to hear. Normally, he would have laughed and pretended to know her, but he didn\u2019t feel like it.Tired. Laughing, talking, pretending to be normal.A group of students approached from the other side, waving warmly. He changed directions and\u00a0 quickly walked into the football club\u2019s locker room. Today was a day off from practice, so the locker room was empty.He sighed and sat down on the bench.He didn\u2019t want to go to his counselor and endure boring time having nutritious conversations, or go to the hospital and get evaluated on which medicine would be better. His head was pounding. He knew that no matter how hard he tried, he could not fill that gap in his lifetime.For a moment, dark emotions soared. He struck his hand with a blank face. The door of the nearby rocker was blunt and distorted like a piece of paper. I punched a few more times. Blood splashed on my face from the back of my broken hand.\u201cHaha. Fuck.\u201dHe smiled lightly and ruffled his messy hair. It was then. He heard a voice from somewhere. It was a voice so small and weak that it could not be heard if you were not paying attention. It sounded like a moan or a cry. He walked to the locker in the corner that no one was using and opened the door.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 !\u201dHe reflexively grabbed something that was slammed in front of him. was a person. It was a skinny girl, no, a boy. With his arms and legs tied, the boy\u2019s face gagged in the cheerleading team\u2019s short skirt was full of tears.He didn\u2019t even have to ask him how he ended up in a locker doing something like this. A freckled face, big eyes that made him look anxious, skinny arms and legs that made it hard to believe that he was the same age as him, and above all, an Asian with dark hair and dark eyes.It was an instinctive attribute like that of animals to reject beings who were weak and different from him. There was nothing different about being human. It was just a little surprising that there were still nerds playing such childish pranks.When their eyes met, tears flowed from the boy\u2019s large eyes. He had eyes like a frightened little animal.He let out a small sigh and untied the string that had bound the boy. When the gag on his mouth was released, the boy blinked anxiously before opening his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, are you okay?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBlood\u2026 .\u201dThe boy\u2019s gaze rested on his messy hand. He stifled a laugh.Was this a situation where he should be the one who was worried?Feeling his gaze on him, the boy stuttered, not knowing what to do.\u201cAh, this was just Fred joking around, I mean, I was trying to wear these clothes on purpose\u2026 .\u201dHis gaze fell on the boy\u2019s leg. The boy was even more embarrassed and tried to pull the hem of his short skirt down.\u201cIt suits you well.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt suits you well.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what he was thinking when he said that.Normally, he would have comforted him or said something pretending to be kind, but then he just wanted to spit it out.\u201cAh\u2026 . Th, thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dWas he sick? He felt a sense of wonder beyond absurdity.The boy\u2019s slender fingers creased and unfolded the skirt hem, and he was still at a loss for what to do. Maybe it was because of the short skirt, his eyes went to his skinny legs.He went to his locker and opened the door. Then without a word he picked up the clothes and threw them at the boy. The boy, who took the clothes, fumbling, looked at him with wide eyes.\u201cIt looks good on you, but you can\u2019t go out like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah yes. Th, thanks\u2026 .\u201dThe boy who received the training suit thanked him with a lifeless voice.He picked up the bag he had left on the bench again. Gradually, he was getting tired of hearing the \u2018Thank you\u2019 that he didn\u2019t understand.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dHe turned his head to the voice calling out to him.\u201cTo give this back\u2026 .\u201d\u201cThrow it away.\u201dHe replied briefly. Not only is it useless to be rewarded by a man who\u2019s not a woman, but now he didn\u2019t even want to say anything out of the ordinary.\u201cWell, it\u2019s still new, so it\u2019s a shame to throw it away\u2026 .\u201d\u201cDo whatever you feel like.\u201dAnd he left the locker room.A group of people who had passed by from afar approached with their hands flashing something. He saw the panties of the nerd-like kid with his pants down. His anger rose.\u201cHey, Phil. You disappeared a while ago, so I was looking for you.\u201d\u201cAre you coming to Ella\u2019s party later this evening?\u201d\u201cI think she prepared well this time. She set up a party as soon as she heard that you broke up with Megan. I heard she\u2019s trying hard to be your birthday party partner.\u201dA roar of laughter erupted.Filthy bastards. The boy\u2019s warm arms wrapped around his shoulders without any understanding. laughing like a bastard. The smell of sweat that he didn\u2019t even wash after exercising.\u2026 fuck off.\u201cAre you going to go? There must be women lining up to get in your Ferrari today.\u201dDark emotions flowed through the gaps that had never been filled since he was born.\u201cYea. See you later.\u201dStanding above the dark emotions, he smiled softly.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Side 2Translated by NaralaraEdited by Naralara\u2018It has improved a lot. A new drug will help. As long as you manage your stress well, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to worry about.\u2019Fucking doctor bastard.As the face of the psychiatrist, who had been joking around as if looking through all the human beings in the world, came to mind, a smirk appeared on Philip\u2019s lips.When she heard that the new drug had a good effect, his mother was relieved. Then she looked back at him with warm eyes and said, \u201cThat\u2019s really good.\u201dPhillip pressed his hand to his temple. My head was pounding. Whether it was a side effect of the new medicine or the insomnia that had continued for several days, the headache did not go away.A beep sounded from the cell phone in his pocket. It was Ella. It was a message to have lunch together. The message window did not disappear from the cell phone all day because of her, who sent messages knowing that they had just slept once.Philip turned off his cell phone.He didn\u2019t feel like flirting with anyone. He just wanted to quietly close his eyes and lie down. He purposely headed for the empty lot behind the library building. He remembered a girl he met at the library once before, who took him to a place no one knew about. She graduated last year, so if what she said was true, he was the only one who knew the place now.After walking around the building for a while, he saw a bench. The bench placed under the shade of the tree was so old that it had barely maintained its shape.It was just the right size for sex.Philip remembered the past with an expressionless face and laid himself flat on the bench.It was good.The sound of the blue wind in early summer, shaking the trees, increased. He closed his eyes.How long was he asleep? He opened his closed eyes at the rustling sound. He saw white sneakers. As he slowly raised his gaze upward, he met eyes that seemed to have been terrified.\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to wake you up.\u201dIt was the boy he met in the locker room the other day.If it was a normal day, he would have gently told him not to worry about it because he wasn\u2019t sleeping, but the kind words didn\u2019t come out because his mood had subsided. He got annoyed when he remembered the woman who talked about this place as if it was a secret place only she knew.\u201cI thought no one was there, but originally, it was a place where no one came. But there was someone, and I was surprised\u2026 . I was just trying to figure out who it was\u2026 .\u201dAccording to the boy, what the woman said was not a lie at all.\u201c\u2026 I will go.\u201dWhen no answer came back, the grassy boy lowered his head and ended his speech.\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dPhillip laid down again.The person he thought would return, hesitated and sat down on the edge of the bench. It was big enough for the two of them to lay down and have sex, so the boy sitting on the edge didn\u2019t bother him too much.The sound of a paper bag being carefully opened was heard. Philip opened his eyes again. The boy who had just taken the sandwich out of the paper bag froze. He was like a herbivore who had a gun to his head.\u201cWo, would you like to eat?\u201dThe herbivore cut his food in half.If he had a gun in his hand right now, would he have pulled the trigger?Philip looked at the boy with a smirk.When Philip just stared at him, the boy stuttered in confusion and continued.\u201cI didn\u2019t put it in my mouth yet.\u201dPhilip almost burst out laughing.With or without his mouth, did he really think he\u2019d covet that little piece of a sandwich?\u201cPeanut butter and jelly\u2026 .\u201dHe felt like the boy was going to burst into tears again if he left him alone. Phillip took the sandwich without a word. As the boy glanced at him, Philip took a bite of the sandwich. Then the boy began to eat the sandwich little by little. It seemed like an animal was sparing his prey.\u201c\u2026 is it okay?\u201dThe boy looked carefully and asked.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThen hand\u2026 injury.\u201dPhilip said, \u201cAh,\u201d and looked down at the back of his hand, which was still torn. After seeing the wound, his mother was scared and asked him if he hurt someone again.\u201cApply some medicine. It may leave scars.\u201dHe wanted to ask the nerd whether he was in a condition to worry about others\u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re not wearing a skirt today.\u201dInstead, he responded with a mean joke. The boy\u2019s face suddenly turned red.\u201cAh, that\u2019s not what I wanted to wear\u2026 , Fred\u2026 .\u201dIt seemed surprisingly stupid to be embarrassed and make excuses for a joke that was said randomly.He took a bite of the rest of the sandwich and stood up.\u201c\u2026 Are you going?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGoodbye.\u201dWatching the boy jump up from his seat and say goodbye, Philip smiled. This is why he got bulliedPhilip, who was about to shake off his clothes and walk, was urgently called by the boy from behind.\u201cWait\u2026 Wait a minute.\u201dWhen Philip turned around, the boy asked with nervous eyes.\u201cCan I come here tomorrow too?\u201dWhat the hell does that have to do with him?Philip shrugged his shoulders, and replied, \u201cWhatever.\u201d Then the boy smiled and said:\u201cThanks.\u201dPhilip thought, as he looked into the harmless eyes with no self-respect, looking at him.If he had a gun, he would have pulled the trigger.He walked down the hill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Philip closed his eyes and leaned back again.What the woman said was not a complete lie. He\u2019d been taking naps here a few times since then, but no one showed up here except that whitish idiot.The boy sat on the edge of the bench and opened the paper bag.\u201cWould you like some?\u201dAs usual today, the boy cut his food in half and offered him one. And again, he started explaining the menu without missing a beat.\u201cThis is called rice cake, but it\u2019s Korean food. It may seem a little strange at first, but as you eat it\u2026 .\u201d\u201cI know. I\u2019ve eaten it.\u201dHearing that he already knows, the boy\u2019s face turned red. Philip took the rice cake carefully wrapped in white paper.\u201cIt was my brother\u2019s birthday yesterday, so my mother made it. Because my mother is of Korean descent, she makes cakes and rice cakes together on birthdays. Tteok is like a traditional Korean cake.\u201dThe boy spoke carefully about things he was not even curious about.Philip was also of Korean descent, so it was food he remembered eating a few times when he went to Korea as a child. There was no proper food for something with the word \u201ctradition\u201d on it.With an expressionless face, Philip began to eat the rice cake, and the boy quickly pulled out water from the bag and held it out.\u201cIf you eat it all at once, your throat will get stuffy\u2026 .\u201dPhilip took the water without hesitation. It was the first time they met, so strangely, he thought that it wouldn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t smile pretentiously in front of the boy.After eating all the rice cakes and drinking water, the boy crouched and looked at Philip.\u201cIt\u2019s tasty.\u201d\u201c\u2026 thanks.\u201dAlthough he did not make it, the boy was genuinely delighted with the word.The boy took the book out of his bag and began to read. After eating, the boy didn\u2019t say any more as if he had finished his job. Philip leaned back on the back of the bench and closed his eyes. He could only hear the occasional sound of the dry paper flipping over. It was a lazy afternoon.Philip opened his eyes, resting his head on the backrest. The boy was reading a book intently.The most plausible depiction of human emotions was a book. Philip\u2019s hobby, realizing that fact early, also became reading. Unlike other people, there was no teacher as good as a book for him, who could not normally feel emotions. In order to plausibly emulate and imitate emotions, there must be an object of imitation.When he saw a boy reading a book with his eyes lit up with an absorbed face, his curiosity about how that could be so much fun abruptly surged.\u201cIs it fun?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah yes.\u201dThe boy closed the bookcase and nodded.\u201cWhat is it about?\u201dIt was a fickle curiosity. A curiosity as small as a stone you kick away while walking.\u201cSo, one day the main character\u2026 .\u201dThe boy, who had always read the book without saying a word, began to explain with his eyes shining. It was unexpected.\u201cSo, with the planetary friend he met there\u2026 .\u201dThe boy, who had been talking up to that point, seemed to have regained his sanity at that time, blushing and closing his eyes.\u201c\u2026 sorry. It\u2019s not fun, is it?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t fun at all. It was simply surprising. The fact that he can be so passionate about something.\u201cDo you think it would be fun?\u201dPhilip responded with that characteristic soft smile. The boy hesitated, then carefully held out his book.\u201cThen do you want to borrow it?\u201d\u201cLater.\u201dPhilip got up from his seat. It was time to attend the afternoon class.\u201cThen, then\u2026 .\u201dAfter hesitating, the boy said goodbye.Were they going to say goodbye like that?Philip thought about it for a moment, but he was too lazy to answer, so he nodded his head and went down the hill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He saw the face of a boy standing behind him.It was the first time the boy spoke first in the school, off the bench on the hill. Phillip glanced down at the boy. When the usual greeting didn\u2019t come back, the boy stuttered as if he was very nervous.\u201cOh, I waited yesterday, but you didn\u2019t come. That book is out of print, but I accidentally found the second volume in a second-hand bookstore\u2026 .\u201dThe boy took a book out of his bag.\u201cWhat book?\u201dAt Philip\u2019s question, the boy was even more nervous and did not know what to do. It was then. A large arm approached from behind and shook the boy\u2019s head in a mess.\u201cHey. What are you doing here? Peter Rabbit.\u201dIt was Fred from the same football team. He grabbed the boy\u2019s head several times and shook it. It was neither a sign of friendliness nor a greeting. It was just a prank, doing whatever he wanted without thinking about the other person.The slender boy\u2019s body staggered sideways. The book in the boy\u2019s hand fell to the floor.\u201cPhil. Didn\u2019t the coach say he\u2019ll see you later?\u201dFred looked at Philip and spoke to him.\u201cReally? Thanks for letting me know.\u201d\u201cPhilip. We were supposed to meet at Haley\u2019s later, are you coming?\u201dPeople quickly gathered around Philip. The boy ran around to pick up the books, avoiding people\u2019s feet.\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u201cAbout 7 o\u2019clock?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go when the time comes.\u201d\u201cI heard Haley\u2019s cousin is coming too. A kid who goes to school in France.\u201d\u201cHave you seen a picture of her? She looks really awesome.\u201d\u201cWait, feet\u2026 .\u201dThe boy spoke carefully to get the book from his feet.\u201cHuh? What? Were you still there?\u201dFred, who had been squinting at the boy the whole time, grunted as if he hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201c\u2026 Get out of the way.\u201dThe boy tried to get the book out, but Fred stepped on it more and picked it up.\u201cWhat book is that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do I know what books that nerd reads?\u201dFred\u2019s party burst into laughter. The boy\u2019s face turned red.\u201cWhat else is this?\u201dFred took the brown paper bag from the boy\u2019s hand. Then he pulled out what was inside and shook it.\u201cGive it back.\u201d\u201cWhy are you carrying something like this goat dung so preciously?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, it\u2019s my brother\u2019s birthday, so it\u2019s the food my mother made.\u201d\u201cDo you eat goat poop on your birthday in Korea? Is it because you\u2019re at war?\u201dWhat Fred was holding in his hand wasn\u2019t goat dung, but red bean cake. The Korean War was stopped more than half a century ago. But Philip wasn\u2019t willing to explain that to an idiot who seemed to be made of muscles without any brain.\u201cGive it back.\u201dThe boy said with eyes that looked like they were about to burst into tears. Fred giggled more excitedly.\u201cMmm, if you cry and cry, I\u2019ll give it back. Cry like a goat.\u201d\u201cFred, you crazy bastard.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do when you hear a goat? You\u2019re crazy.\u201dAs if this was normal for his party, no one tried to stop them. The boy stretched out his arms and tried to take the bag from Fred\u2019s hand, but to no avail because of the height difference. Fred raised the bag to the top and giggled and grinned.Then Philip made eye contact with the boy. Because of his innate lack, Philip found it difficult to read the emotions of others. He could not fully feel or understand the emotions that ordinary people would take for granted. From the moment he realized that he was not normal, he observed and imitated others. Thanks to this, he now had the ability to read other people\u2019s emotions even in the most subtle facial expressions.Expectation.The boy was now looking towards him. He believed that he will extend a hand of salvation to him this time as he has helped him once before.Philip had no obligation or need to live up to expectations. He crossed his arms and smiled obliquely.How stupid can he be to expect such kindness from others?While Philip smiled and looked down at the boy, the guy standing next to Fred was joking and bumped into him. Giggling, Fred let go of the paper bag, and one of the party didn\u2019t see it and stepped on it.The trampled rice cake was literally crushed like shit. The boy picked up the sticky rice cakes on the floor and put them back in the bag.\u201cUh, that wasn\u2019t on purpose\u2026 .\u201dFred scratched his head in a bit of embarrassment. Thick tears fell on the back of the boy\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat are you crying about? I can just buy you a sandwich. Throw away that shit\u2026 .\u201dFred tried to lift the boy up. But the boy shook his hand and stood up. Tears were dripping down, wetting the collar of the blue shirt the boy was wearing.It was an interesting sight.When the boy, who seemed ordinary, burst into tears, his impression subtly changed. The tip of the nose and the tears in the eyes, the tears dripping down a perfect trajectory, and the wet eyelashes drew people\u2019s attention.In another word, he thought the boy could cry quite nicely.But how can he cry at such an age?\u201cFred. Did you make him cry again?\u201d\u201cIf you like him that much, just stick together with him.\u201d\u201cFuck, what are you talking about? Am I crazy?\u201dFred was hot-tempered and had a temper. He was a mean kid who showed his interest in a crooked way.\u201cBy the way, since when did you two know each other?\u201dHenry, who was standing next to Fred, looked at Philip and asked in surprise. They thought that there was no way two people from different school years could get to know each other without a special occasion during the semester.\u201cMe?\u201dPhilip pointed at himself and asked.\u201cWeren\u2019t you two talking?\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes met. eyes very frightened. Philip looked into those eyes and smiled long. Then he shrugs his shoulders.\u201cI don\u2019t even know his name.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie. It was only today that he heard for the first time that the boy\u2019s name was Peter.The boy\u2019s face suddenly turned red. Then he wiped away the tears and ran away from the place. Fred licked his lips like a dog that had lost food and followed the boy\u2019s back with his eyes.\u201cBut what do French women like? Can we talk about cheese?\u201d\u201cHow can we talk about cheese? You bastard.\u201dThe subject of the conversation quickly changed to Haley\u2019s cousin, who was said to be from France. Philip picked up the book that had fallen in the corner. It was one of the books the boy had brought to lend him.He remembered the boy who took out the book as if full of anticipation. And when no one took his side, he even burst into tears.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dPhilip answered, wiping the dust off the book.So who crossed the line?He smiled and put the book into his bag.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Philip sat down next to him and took a book out of his bag and handed it to him.\u201cHere.\u201dIt was the book that the boy had left behind without being able to pick it up. The boy took the book. An awkward silence followed. The boy who was fiddling with the book began to speak with difficulty.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dPhilip doubted his ears. Naturally, he thought that the other person would be angry with him or pretend not to know. Because he ignored the boy\u2019s expectations. In fact, it didn\u2019t matter how he reacted.To him, others were the object of observation. It was necessary to pay attention to how they reacted and spoke depending on the situation.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know you were coming\u2026 .\u201dThis was the first time he\u2019d met this type. How can he be tempted to apologize in a situation like this?\u201cOf course I knew you wouldn\u2019t come, but I didn\u2019t leave any\u2026 .\u201dThe boy looked down at the last piece of sandwich left and was confused. Philip looked at the boy blankly for a moment, then burst into laughter.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u201dThe sound of refreshing laughter was carried by the wind and shook the leaves. Philip laughed for a while, as if he was really happy, then leaned his back on the bench.\u201cYeah. I was expecting a sandwich.\u201dThe boy made a sincere expression of regret for the lie he told.\u201cI\u2019ll buy more tomorrow. Oh, if you don\u2019t come tomorrow, even the next day\u2026 , no, if you tell me the day you will come, on that day\u2026 .\u201dHe really was a nerd beyond imagination.Philip looked at the boy softly, then said, \u201cYeah,\u201d and smiled. It was an elegant and pretty smile. It was definitely something to be thankful to his parents for giving him an appearance that could plausibly hide rotten inside.\u201cBut what happened after that?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe main character suddenly betrayed the country and left the guild.\u201d\u201cDid you read this?\u201dThe boy looked up at the book in his hand and asked.\u201cYes. It was fun.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a complete lie. At least it was interesting enough for him to be curious about what happened.\u201cYou have to read book 1 to understand that part, but you read book 2 first\u2026\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI have to return the first book to the library and borrow it again\u2026 .\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s okay.\u201dPhillip laid down on the bench. He also had trouble sleeping yesterday. Philip closed his eyes, hoping he could make up for the lack of sleep.\u201c\u2026 Then can I briefly explain the contents of the first volume?\u201dPhilip opened his eyes. Kind, big eyes look down at him. It was a harmless look that wouldn\u2019t even suspect anything if a gun was pointed at his forehead.\u201cDo whatever you feel like.\u201dThe boy began to explain the plot of the novel. Philip closed his eyes again. A cool breeze from the forest brushed his cheeks. A hoarse voice continued speaking.It didn\u2019t feel too bad.***\u201cThe writer you read before, it\u2019s a new work.\u201dThe boy took a book out of his bag and handed it to him. Philip said thank you and took the book. The boy smiled bashfully and turned his head shyly.From that day on, Philip often borrowed books from the boy. The boy\u2019s reading taste was not bad. After reading the book, Phillip returned his brief impression, and the boy nodded with his eyes wide open.There were times when he met the boy at school. The boy passed Philip pretending to not know him or talk to him as before. The only point of contact between the two was the bench on the hill.\u201cAnd this.\u201dThe boy held out a brown envelope. Today, it was a crepe with tomatoes, cabbage and cheese.\u201cI will eat well.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the boy smiled slightly. A small tooth appeared between the smiling lips.Even considering that he was Asian, the boy looked very young. The large eyes seemed innocent enough to evoke the sadism that lay beneath the human face.So that\u2019s why that fucking piglet follows him.Philip took a large bite of the crepe and opened the book. As he turned a few pages, he suddenly felt a gaze and looked up, and the boy hurriedly turned his face. As Philip looked at him puzzled, the boy began to speak as if he were making excuses.\u201cWell, that book, I enjoyed it. \u2026 because it\u2019s so much fun\u2026 .\u201dWhen the boy handed him his favorite book, his face became redder than usual. He wanted others to like what he liked. It was a simple mind like a child.\u201cInteresting.\u201dAlthough he only read a few pages, it was a work that clearly showed the author\u2019s wit and storytelling ability.\u201cThe previous works by that author are interesting, but I really liked this novel. This time, a movie was also made and released.\u201dThe boy spoke with excitement. Fucking uninteresting, but Phillip said, \u2018Is it?\u2019 and matched his enthusiasm.\u201cThe film is also very well made. The reviews were good too.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to watch it when it comes out on DVD.\u201d\u201cTake a look when you get a chance,\u201d the boy added cautiously, and then gave him a smile that made him look like an idiot. When Philip answered bluntly, \u201cI will,\u201d the boy slowly began to eat his lunch.After eating all the crepes, Philip stood up.\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe boy didn\u2019t say they\u2019ll see each other again like before. Perhaps because of the previous events, the boy clearly kept the line.\u201cHey, wait a minute.\u201dThe boy got up and started looking through his bag.\u201cHere.\u201dThen he held out a small envelope.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a tea bag. They say this tea is good for insomnia.\u201d\u201cAh, that.\u201dThe boy had picked up a medicine box that had fallen out of Philip\u2019s pocket before. The boy who was worried that he might be sick was bothering him, so he said it was an insomnia drug.\u201cThanks.\u201dIn fact, he wasn\u2019t thankful for anything. It wasn\u2019t Philip\u2019s taste to boil water with leaves.\u201cIt\u2019s a tea that my aunt picked and made herself. Drink it before bedtime.\u201dPhilip put the envelope he had been handed over to his pocket. When he saw a trash can on the way, he thought of throwing it away.\u201cI have nothing to give. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo. You helped me then. I couldn\u2019t even respond properly\u2026 . Anyway, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201cHmm,\u201d said Philip, pulling his lips together and smiling.Each time he met the boy, he shared his lunch and lent him a book. He didn\u2019t cross the line or pretend to know him presumptuously. Even if he considered how he helped him before, he had already received enough.He didn\u2019t have to give back what he received, but he had to make some social gestures. It was a way of blending in between people effortlessly. Moreover, if it was received, there was a high probability that at some point the other party would freely choose the method of reciprocation. It was Philip who was bothered by that.\u201cDo you have time this weekend?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cMovie. It\u2019s the opening.\u201dPhilip looked up the book and said.The boy still couldn\u2019t understand the meaning of the words, so he just stared at him with his eyes wide open.\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a ticket.\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh no. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cI feel bad for just taking it.\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to the movies together.\u2019Learn morePauseUnmuteSwallowing his words, Philip smiled sweetly.\u201cI\u2019ll buy you two. Go see it with your girlfriend.\u201d\u201cAh. \u2026 Yes.\u201dThe nape of the boy nodded his neck bright red. He knew that the boy had no girlfriend to go to the movies with.Either that or not, he didn\u2019t know.It was a similar level of kindness to him, a movie ticket with no one to go to, or a tea bag in his pocket that would soon go into the trash.\u201cSee you later.\u201dAt Philip\u2019s greeting, the boy nodded. Philip lightly waved his hand and went down the hill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Chapter 6Translated by NaralaraEdited by Naralara\u201cWhere the hell is it?\u201dInseop murmured, searching the back seat carefully again, which he had already searched several times.The lucky stone. He left it in the back seat. He knew he couldn\u2019t film without that.Since taking the lucky stone only once in the past, Lee Wooyeon has never mentioned it. However, Inseop nodded his head that he would definitely find it without thinking about how sad Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice was when he lost the lucky stone.\u201cHa, where is it?\u201dHe searched not only the back seat, but also the front seat, and the box in the trunk of the car just in case. However, there were no stones, let alone lucky stones.This would be a case of when people say that spirits take your stuff.Inseop thought of the expressions he learned in classHe imagined what sound it was, but he got scared and quit quickly.\u201cWhat should I do?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t even ask Lee Wooyeon, who was filming for a long time. Inseop, who was biting his lips alone, hit his knee thinking of the right person.He took out his cell phone and dialed the number. A few beeps followed by a familiar voice over the phone.<Hello.>\u201cManager Cha. Hello. It\u2019s Choi Inseop.\u201d<Oh. Inseop. Something happened to Lee Wooyeon?>Manager Cha\u2019s voice was low.\u201cNo, nothing happened. How\u2019s your leg?\u201d<Hahaha. I feel like my body and mind are getting healthier because I don\u2019t see Lee Wooyeon.>Manager Cha\u2019s voice, who had recently completed the surgery, was very cheerful.<But you wouldn\u2019t have called to ask how I was doing. What\u2019s going on?>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019d like to ask you something.\u201dManager Cha was Lee Wooyeon\u2019s oldest manager. He thought he\u2019d know for sure.\u201cManager, do you know where the lucky stone that Lee Wooyeon cherish is?\u201d<\u2026 Lucky stone?>\u201cYes. He asked me to find it in the car, but I couldn\u2019t find it.\u201dWhile talking on the phone, Inseop searched carefully between the seats. There was a heavy silence over the phone. He wondered if the call was disconnected. He called for Cha.<Inseop. You can be honest. You fought with Lee Wooyeon, right?>\u201cWhat? No,\u201d Inseop replied in surprise.<Then you want me to bring it to you when nothing happened?>Inseop blinked a couple of times because he couldn\u2019t understand Cha\u2019s reaction.\u201cWhat, did I make a mistake?\u201dWhen he asked that, Cha sighed.<Lee Wooyeon, did you meet each other for only a day or two? Do you think he\u2019s the kind of person who believes in superstitions? Do you think he\u2019d have a piece of that pure heart?>\u201c\u2026\u201dHe wanted to defend him, but Manager Cha didn\u2019t stop talking.<It\u2019s that dog\u2019s trick. When he wants to fire a manager he doesn\u2019t like, he guilts people by saying it\u2019s a lucky stone.>\u201cWhen firing a manager he doesn\u2019t like\u2026\u201dHe gasped because he thought Manager Cha made a mistake. Then, he changed his words immediately, saying, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t like Inseop.\u201d\u201cNo, thank you for letting me know. I\u2019m sorry to bother you when you\u2019re busy.\u201d<I\u2019m sorry. Actually, that\u2019s my job\u2026 no, it\u2019s not my job CEO Kim, just take this con artist.>Manager Cha gritted his teeth. He also heard that Inseop knew that Cha continued to take the managerial position of Lee Wooyeon, which was temporarily agreed upon.\u201cThen take care of yourself. I should get going now. I\u2019m in the middle of a photoshoot.\u201d<Okay. Call me if anything happens.>Inseop said thanks and ended the call.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dHe sat leaning against the seat. He wasted an hour trying to find a stone that didn\u2019t even exist. So, was Lee Wooyeon\u2019s previous work at the amusement park to fire him? He was so scared that he thought his heart was going to stop.Inseop sat still and recalled the events of that time. Lee Wooyeon, who strode in to find the lucky stone in the icy water when he foolishly and desperately tried to find it. And in the Ferris wheel, which went around a few laps, he realized.He can\u2019t hate him from the heart.Inseop got up from the seat and got off the van. He locked the car door and checked it twice.A lot has changed. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s strange trick was the same as before, but it was not as scary or resentful as then.Of course, there were things that didn\u2019t change.\u201c\u2026 It was bad.\u201dInseop sighed and began to murmur and walk to find the bad guy.At the sound of someone knocking on the car glass, Inseop opened his closed eyes.\u201cWere you sleeping?It was Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was just closing my eyes for a while,\u201d saying that, Inseop got up right away and got out of the car.\u201cI\u2019ve searched everywhere in the car, but I haven\u2019t found a lucky stone.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right. It\u2019s nothing to worry about. It must be somewhere.\u201dInseop nodded. Lee Wooyeon asked with his head tilted as he looked a little depressed.\u201cAre you sick?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cMaybe you\u2019re tired because it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes. I guess so.\u201dLee Wooyeon slightly ruffled Inseop\u2019s hair.\u201cYou take a break in the car. The shoot is over, but I think I need to talk to the director for a second.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201dLee Wooyeon shook his head at Inseop\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019m just going to talk anyway. I\u2019ll be right back. Wait here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes\u201dLee Wooyeon left right away. Inseop sighed and leaned against the car.He lied. He wasn\u2019t sleeping. After hearing the truth about the lucky stone, Inseop went back to the set with a smile. He was going to say a word to Lee Wooyeon who made an absurd request.\u2018What the hell are you thinking? I won\u2019t fall for that joke anymore.\u2019\u2026Was the tone too harsh? Inseop moved his steps, trimming what he had to say to Lee Wooyeon inside. As soon as he entered the set, Inseop was surprised. The atmosphere was quite different from before. He could not hear a breath other than the sound of the camera shutter. Inseop knew the reason for the heavy silence right away.Lee Wooyeon and the female model were tangled in a sensual posture. Usually, they take one cut, check it on the monitor, and change the pose, but the filming continued without saying anything.Lee Wooyeon stretched out his arms, hugged the woman\u2019s waist, and brought her close.The lips of Lee Wooyeon and the female model wearing a slip dress that seemed to show her chest were almost touching.Inseop\u2019s blood got cold. He felt like someone poured cold ice water on him. He had to hold and unfold his cold hands several times.It was embarrassing. Was it this hard to tell between work and private life?He was surprised himself. Then suddenly, he realized that he saw Lee Wooyeon working for the first time since they fully confirmed each other\u2019s feelings.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips smiled and held the woman\u2019s lips.He hated it\u2026Inseop lowered his head, rubbing his cold palm against his trousers. This was why CEO Kim and Cha, as well as Lee Wooyeon, were against it.He came back to the car. He thought he\u2019d burst into tears if he stayed there.Like an idiot.It was work, it was a common scene before, and it was a sight he would see in the future. He knew it, but he couldn\u2019t recover from the bad feeling. Inseop leaned into the driver\u2019s seat and closed his eyes.Let\u2019s forget, let\u2019s forget, let\u2019s forget.The more it was repeated, the clearer the scene he saw earlier became.Did Lee Wooyeon know this and asked him to find the lucky stone that he did not have? If he thought of himself as a professional manager, he wouldn\u2019t have asked. He would be disqualified in many waysWhen Lee Wooyeon eventually returned after filming, Inseop eventually lied.Pretend he didn\u2019t see the set.So, why wasn\u2019t Lee Wooyeon coming when he said he would only be gone for a while? Did he happen to have the model with him\u2026\u00a0 Inseop shook his head quickly. Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t be like that, but to suspect him like a worthless person with his own delusion..\u201cHa, you\u2019re so ugly.\u201dInseop muttered and kicked the bumpy part of the parking lot floor with his toes. He was doing that for a long time when he heard a sign of activity. She was the female model and manager who filmed with Lee Wooyeon. Their eyes met. He bowed his head in surprise. They also greeted Inseop with a smile as if they recognized him.Realizing himself wanting Lee Wooyeon to come a little later, Inseop bit his lip softly.Was he crazy right now?Then, the sound of footsteps approached. When he looked up, Naima was standing right in front of Inseop. Embarrassed by the unexpected situation, Inseop couldn\u2019t say anything and just looked at her.[May I have his number?]\u201cUh\u2026\u201dWhen Inseop couldn\u2019t give a specific answer, she pretended to call him by hand, as if she had guessed he couldn\u2019t speak English.What should he do?.The thumping of his heart rang in his ear. He broke out in a cold sweat. As a manager, he had to respond appropriately, but he couldn\u2019t talk.When Inseop was white and hardened, Naima gestured to the manager to get the bag. Taking out a paper and a fan from her bag, she wrote down her phone number and handed it to Inseop.[Give it to him.]It was a word that only middle school students could understand. Since he learned and studied Korean from his father since he was young, Inseop\u2019s Korean was almost perfect.Even so, it was based on foreigners. Inseop\u2019s native language was English. When he first came to Korea, English was a more familiar language for him to fall asleep listening to American dramas in loneliness.\u201cOh, that\u2026I, Can\u2019t\u2026 speak english.\u201dNaima burst into laughter when she heard Inseop\u2019s answer.Inseop couldn\u2019t even raise his head, lowering his red-hot face.Naima said \u2018see you later \u2018and disappeared with her manager.\u2026 He wanted to die.Inseop sat down with his face wrapped in his face in the pouring patheticness.He couldn\u2019t speak English. He couldn\u2019t run and give her Lee Wooyeon\u2019s contact information because it was personal information, but should he say \u2018I\u2019ll give him this note?\u2019Inseop checked the note. The name, contact number, and simple words to look forward to seeing him next time were written in elegant handwriting.\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201dAt the voice above his head, Inseop unconsciously put the note in his pocket.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cAh; nothing. Are you done talking?\u201dInseop quickly stood up from his seat and replied maturely.\u201cYes. The director talks a lot.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled, slightly frowning.\u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201dInseop quickly opened the car door and tried to get into the driver\u2019s seat. Lee Wo-yeon took away the car key in Inseop\u2019s hand.\u201cI\u2019ll drive today.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dLee Wooyeon did not like driving. He only got behind the wheel in unavoidable circumstances, especially driving a van. One day, he asked him why, and he said, \u201cWhen I see people driving like crap on the road, I want to hit them. In particular, the van was easy to drive away from the ground,\u201d returned the refreshing answer. Since then, Inseop has vowed never to hand over the steering wheel to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cNo, I\u2019ll drive.\u201d\u201cInseop, you\u2019re tired. You look a bit pale.\u201dLee Wooyeon held Inseop\u2019s cheek and said. Inseop shook his hand in amazement.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I was just closing my eyes because I was sleepy.\u201dLee Wooyeon glanced at his shaken hand and grabbed Inseop\u2019s cheek again as if nothing had happened.\u201cInseop, there\u2019s no one to tell you anything about resting.\u201dInseop quickly put down Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand and shook his head.\u201cThis is my job. Get in the back,\u201d Inseop said firmly. Lee Wooyeon looked down at his hand one more time, and smiled obliquely.\u201cInseop.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my job to worry about you.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s words quickly heated Inseop\u2019s cheeks. Even if he tried to straighten hihs face as if he was okay, he couldn\u2019t hide the face and neck that were already on fire.\u201cThanks\u2026 There\u2026, I still want to do it. Let me do it. I beg you.\u201dThe murmuring voice was cute. Lee Wooyeon said, \u201cThen let me ride next to you,\u201d and opened the passenger\u2019s door without receiving an answer.Choi Inseop sighed quietly and got into the driver\u2019s seat.It was not far from the set to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house. Inseop asked Lee Wooyeon as he left the parking lot.\u201cShould I take you to the fitness center?\u201dIt was his routine to go exercise after work.\u201cNo, let\u2019s just go home today. I\u2019m a little tired, too.\u201d Lee Wooyeon replied with a look of no tiredness.\u201cYes, I see.\u201dInseop drove slowly. Lee Wooyeon leaned on the passenger seat and stared at Inseop. It was a blatant gaze that he couldn\u2019t ignore. Inseop, who would normally have blushed and asked what was going on, was driving while looking forward while biting his lower lip.\u201cAre you really tired?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.\u201cWhat? No. I\u2019m all right.\u201dLee Wooyeon was lost in thought. Soon after, he was able to reach Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house. Inseop stopped the car at the designated parking spot and arrived, and then turned his head toward Lee Wooyeon. Their eyes met. Lee Wooyeon called him.\u201cInseop, you don\u2019t have to do it if you\u2019re tired.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cUntil Manager Cha gets better, I\u2019ll stay calm. Whoever is incharge of me.\u201dIf CEO Kim Hakseung heard it, it would have been a line to dance in tears.\u201cNo. I\u2019m not tired,\u201d Inseop added, shaking his head quickly.\u201cI want to do it. I really want to do this.\u201d\u201cWhy? Why do you want to do this?\u201dInseop, who didn\u2019t expect to hear the same question from CEO Kim from Lee Wooyeon, was quite embarrassed.\u201cIf you need money, take my money. I\u2019ll give you as much as you want.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take the answer except for the answer that you\u2019re trying to build a sense of independence.\u201d Inseop hesitated, grabbed the hem of his clothes and let go.\u201cWell, I owe you and the manager, and I want to reassure my parents by showing them how I work\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear all the reasons you\u2019ve said so far.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also a job I\u2019m good at.\u201d\u201cInseop, there\u2019s something else you\u2019re good at.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s expression was so serious that Inseop weighed the possibility that what he heard was not obscene.\u201cIf you don\u2019t know, we can go up together and let you know.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and touched Inseop\u2019s lips with his thumb.As expected, there\u2019s no possibility.He shook his head, saying no. Lee Wooyeon smiled with his eyes down and said, \u201cI\u2019m kidding.\u201d Inseop thought it was obviously not a joke.Lee Wooyeon continued to talk.\u201cI didn\u2019t call you to Korea to clean up after me.\u201d\u201c\u2026. \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be with you, but I don\u2019t want to see you overdo it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not overdoing it. It\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201dInseop only bit his lower lip.He was tired. He didn\u2019t feel good. He was so depressed that he wanted to cry. However, the feeling he felt today was not because of Lee Wooyeon, but because of himself.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Holding on to a tired man. Go early today and get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201dLee Wooyeon unfastened the seat belt clip to get out of the car. Inseop grabbed the hem of his shirt.\u201c\u2026 I like you.\u201dInseop continued to talk with his head down.\u201cI liked Lee Wooyeon, so I wanted to watch you work and help you. I\u2019m sorry for being selfish to satisfy my greed.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmuteLee Wooyeon was just curious as to where his intentions were to satisfy his greed, from getting out early in the morning, preparing his schedule, driving all day, and sitting and waiting for him.\u201cI\u2019d like to\u2026\u201dInseop\u2019s trembling voice died down very quietly.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI want to sleep at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house today\u2026If it doesn\u2019t bother you.\u201dInseop regretted that he shouldn\u2019t have said what he added at the end. Of course, it would be a nuisance to someone who is tired and skipping exercise.\u201cWhat time does the schedule start tomorrow?\u201dWhen the question about the schedule, not his question, came back, Inseop blinked in embarrassment and replied,\u201cThere is no schedule tomorrow and it is from 2 p.m. the day after tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dLee Wooyeon reached out and pulled Inseop\u2019s seat belt by himself.\u201cThen I won\u2019t have to take my dick out from Inseop\u2019s hole all day long tomorrow.\u201dHe was so embarrassed that Inseop couldn\u2019t answer. Lee Wooyeon got out of the car first.\u201cYou can stay there if you want to have car sex.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, Inseop jumped out of the car like a cat with a burning tail.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mr. Wooyeon, I\u2019ll take a shower\u2026\u201dAs expected, as soon as the door closed, Lee Wooyeon rushed at Inseop as if to eat him.Inseop, who barely took off his shoes, desperately stopped Lee Wooyeon.\u201cToday, I worked all day\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was biting the scruff of Inseop\u2019s neck, stopped moving. He grabbed him by the wrist and dragged him to the bathroom. Lee Wooyeon put Inseop into the bathtub without taking off his clothes. He didn\u2019t know what was happening, but Inseop stood motionless, his eyes wide open.Lee Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s jacket and threw it on the bathroom floor, then grabbed his waist and pulled him closer. Their lips overlapped and he could feel the heat from their mouth. As Inseop gasped for breath and tried to pull himself back, Lee Wooyeon grabbed the back of Inseop\u2019s hair and kissed him deeper. Lee Wooyeon, who had been sucking his tongue for a while, let go of Inseop. Inseop, who was barely freed, stood leaning against the tile wall breathing heavily.\u201cI heard that if you want a relationship to last a long time, you have to be considerate of the other person.\u201dIn Lee Wooyeon\u2019s actions, consideration for the other person could not be feltPerhaps, Inseop was afraid that all of this might be a paving stone for a short romance.\u201cI\u2019m really bad at that. This place is broken.\u201dLee Wooyeon tapped his temple and laughed.Inseop didn\u2019t say anything. Even if his lips were torn open, he couldn\u2019t say that he was good at caring for someone.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. But if Inseop wants, I\u2019ll let you do it.\u201dLee Wooyeon turned on the shower. The lukewarm water poured out. Both their heads and bodies were quickly soaked in the pouring water.\u201cTake a shower.\u201dLee Wooyeon sucked on the nape of Inseop\u2019s neck and kissed him. Inseop groaned as his body trembled. A smile was drawn on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips.\u201cBut what can I do? Because I\u2019m an inconsiderate bastard, I can\u2019t wait until you get out of the shower.\u201dLee Wooyeon bit Inseop\u2019s neck and at the same time reached out and grabbed his crotch.\u201cAh\u2026 wait\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop without hesitation over his clothes. The sound of wet clothes rubbing against his skin grew louder and louder.\u201cYour bottom is all wet. Were you this wet when you were looking at me before?\u201dInseop shook his head. He said that his clothes were wet now because of the water pouring from the shower, but Lee Wooyeon did not listen.\u201cYour underwear must have been wet.\u201dLee Wooyeon tried to treat Inseop, who returned to Korea, as a normal lover. But for Inseop, it was developing into the wrong direction, especially when they were in bed. The obscenity using polite speech doubled the shame. In the end, Inseop cried and asked him to just say what he wanted to say. Since then, Lee Wooyeon has shown his vulgarity without hesitation.\u201cHow much did you cum?\u2026like now.\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026 Uh, I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201dInseop shook his head.\u201cShow me the proof, then.\u201dThere was no coercion like this. The water from the shower was soaking through his clothes and underwear. In this state, he tried to ask how he could show evidence, but Lee Wooyeon urged him as he kept kissing Inseop\u2019s cheek.\u201cShow me now.\u201dHe knew what he was asking for. In the end, Inseop unfastened his belt with trembling hands. Slowly, he opened the gap between my pants and underwear, revealing his bottom. Then Lee Wooyeon, who had been playfully kissing him, stopped moving. His eye twitched, and the corners of his eyes furrow.\u201cFuck.\u201dSurprised by the sudden swearing, Inseop let go of his underwear. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice was threateningly low.\u201cHave you shown this to anyone other than me?\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you saying\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon put his hand inside his pants. Holding on tightly to his cock that had started to get hard, he bit his teeth.\u201cHave you shown this to anyone?\u201dBecause of the surgical scar on his chest, Inseop was reluctant to take off his clothes in front of anyone. He couldn\u2019t even go to a public bath or swimming pool. When he lived in the rooftop room, the hot water was cut off in the middle of winter, but he was able to endure it with gritted teeth.Inseop hung his head several times.\u201cDo you know how hot your cock is?\u201d\u201cAh, ha\u2026 wait\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never looked at a boy\u2019s dick, haa, fuck it. Now, just looking at Inseop\u2019s cock makes me hard.\u201dIt felt like Lee Wooyeon\u2019s big hand was violating his bottom. Inseop closed his eyes tightly and struggled to get his hand out of his underwear, but to no avail.\u201cSo, don\u2019t go around showing off your cock. If you don\u2019t want to see me go crazy. If you understand, just nod your head.\u201dHis genitals swelled tight against his wet pants.\u201cWhat can I do? Mr. Inseop, tell me. Huh?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked quietly as if to soothe him. Inseop\u2019s big eyes were already burning red with excitement and pain.\u201c\u2026remove it\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to ask for details about what to take off. Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s shirt and ripped it off. As the button fell to the bottom of the bathtub, Inseop looked at it with startled eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a shirt, so open your legs properly.\u201dLee Wooyeon pulled Inseop\u2019s pants down with his underwear this time. The half-fallen pants and underwear got caught between his legs, and Inseop hesitated as he stood in the bathtub. He pushed on and sat down on his knees.\u201c\u2026..!\u201dLee Wooyeon buried his face in Inseop\u2019s lower body. Inseop sighed and held his breath. He couldn\u2019t get used to the sensation of having his genitals sucked by a man\u2019s mouth no matter how many times he experienced it. Every time Lee Wooyeon\u2019s teeth touched the soft skin, Inseop trembled. Scary, hot, excited, and a sense of not knowing what it was heated up below.\u201cAh, ha\u2026ah,.\u201dHis legs were shaking and he couldn\u2019t stand up any longer. Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop by the waist and made him lean on his shoulder.Lee Wooyeon laughed. The weight on his shoulders satiated him.\u201cHa, Ugh\u2026ha.\u201dWhen he sucked the bottom with his tongue, Inseop gasped breathlessly. Lee Wooyeon reached out and grabbed Inseop\u2019s buttocks. As he rubbed his fingers between the buttocks, Inseop trembled. Because of the water, at least one finger entered without difficulty.\u201cah\u2026\u201dHis cock twitched in his mouth. Lee Wooyeon touched Inseop\u2019s hole with his finger and sucked him off.\u201cAh, ugh, ugh, ha\u2026 Ah.\u201dLee Wooyeon hated the groaning and high-pitched voices of others. He thought it had nothing to do with him whether the other person felt it or not. However, every time he heard Inseop\u2019s moans close to crying, he felt like he was going crazy. His blood boiled. Hearing the cries alone made his cock stand upright.\u201cHow does it feel?\u201dLee Wooyeon opened his mouth from below and asked. Instead of answering, Choi Inseop hugged him by the neck. A deep smile crept across Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips. It felt so good that his head would spin whenever Inseop clung to him.\u201cAm I good?\u201dInseop nodded.\u201cFuck, you like it, opening your hole, rubbing your cock in my face, even if I just finger you. Haha.\u201dInseop was surprised and tried to pull his waist back, but Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t let go of his waist. Lee Wooyeon increased the number of fingers by one more and rubbed and poked the inside of the hole.\u201cAh, wait\u2026 Mr. Wooyeon,a little\u2026ack.\u201dInseop\u2019s penis, which stood out between his pubic hair, touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cheek. Lee Wooyeon rubbed the side of Inseop\u2019s penis with his high nose bridge and licked it. He could see Inseop\u2019s toes clenching.\u201cHa ha,!\u201dInseop ejaculated in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face. Inseop, who had been out of breath, came back to his senses and cried out.\u201cSorry. I tried to hold it in\u2026\u201dA milky liquid flowed down Lee Wooyeon\u2019s jawline. Without a hint of displeasure, he smiled, wiping his face with the palm of his hand. It was a dangerously raunchy laugh. He got up.\u201cD-don\u2019t eat it. I\u2019ll wipe it off.\u201dInseop hurriedly took out a towel and handed it to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s delicious.\u201dAs if savoring a really delicious food, Lee Wooyeon opened his eyes slightly and smiled. Inseop blushed as he held the towel in his hand.\u201cSo don\u2019t smoke, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop tightly and patted him on the back. With a kind voice, like an adult speaking to a frightened child, he whispered as he rubbed his erect penis against Inseop\u2019s thigh.The shower is over, so let\u2019s go have sex.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a feeling he would never get used to no matter how many times he tried it.\u201cLift your back. I still have to go in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026you\u2019re lying, right?\u201dInseop cried and asked. Seeing this, Lee Wooyeon bit his lower lip. He didn\u2019t know if he was conscious, but from time to time, Inseop spat out words that encouraged him.Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s thighs and spread them apart. He thrusted in with all his might.\u201cAh!\u201dHe hit his back a few more times. Lee Wooyeon looked at the gaping hole. The sight of the tight hole which took in his hard cock stimulated his desire. He tightened his grip on Inseop\u2019s thigh. Handprints were left on the white skin. It was like a sigh that Inseop was his, and Lee Wooyeon was very satisfied.\u201cHaa, Inseop, do you like it?\u201d\u201cAh, no, too\u2026\u201dInseop found the position of being taken from behind especially difficult. This was due to the deep insertion. That\u2019s why it was also Lee Wooyeon\u2019s preferred position.\u201cIs it hard because it\u2019s too deep?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked kindly. Inseop quickly nodded. Lee Wooyeon pulled back. His genitals came out of Inseop\u2019s body with a squelching sound. Before Inseop could breathe a sigh of relief, Lee Wooyeon slammed his cock in again and inserted it as if he were stabbing him.\u201cHow about this?\u201dInseop shook his head. Lee Wooyeon took out his penis again and inserted it.\u201cIs this good enough?\u201d\u201cI-I don\u2019t know\u2026ah, Ugh.\u201d\u201cThen, Inseop, tell me where it feels good.\u201dLee Wooyeon brought Inseop\u2019s hand behind him and made him put it into his hole. Inseop was surprised and turned around.\u201cIf you put your hand in and tell me where it is, I\u2019ll put it there.\u201dHe sounded like he was being kind, but it was a care that was too vulgar. Inseop shook his head.\u201cWhy? You put it in.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t put it in\u2026 I didn\u2019t put it in.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t put your fingers in when you masturbate?\u201dLee Wooyeon kissed Inseop on the back and asked quietly. Inseop nodded eagerly this time.\u201cHave you ever put your finger in it?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cGood. Try putting it in this time, then.\u201dLee Wooyeon opened Inseop\u2019s hole and made him insert his finger into it.\u201cI don\u2019t like this\u2026 Wooyeon, please.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It won\u2019t hurt.\u201dInseop hated it, and his body shook. Even that gesture was lovely. Lee Wooyeon moistened his dry lips and narrowed his eyes.\u201cThen you don\u2019t know how far to put it. I do it because I want to make Inseop feel good.\u201dWith spit on his lips, Lee Wooyeon lied to his heart\u2019s content. Inseop managed to get his finger out and cried.\u201cJust put it in, anywhere is fine\u2026\u201dBefore Inseop could finish his words, Lee Wooyeon lifted his waist.The sound of their skip slapping against each other echoed continuously.\u201cAh, gently, Wooyeon, just a little\u2026 Ah, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cHa, fuck, what do you hate?\u201d\u201cToo deep. Ah, haaa, ah!\u201d\u201cI heard that anywhere is good.\u201dLee Wooyeon mumbled with his teeth gnashed lowly.\u201cInseop, really, haha, I really like it, haa ha, Inseop, I wanted to keep fucking you, so I thought about fucking you all day.\u201dEvery time he had a chance, he imagined taking off the loose suit that didn\u2019t suit Inseop and inserting his dick into his skinny body. He wasn\u2019t like this even when he was a teenager when his eyes opened to sex. Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s slender body and thrusted his hard cock in. He pushed in hard enough to make bubbles form in the hole that was soaked with his cum. Unable to overcome the force, Inseop fell back.Lee Wooyeon turned Inseop\u2019s body to face him. Inseop\u2019s big eyes, burning with heat and out of focus, looked up at Lee Wooyeon. Lee Wooyeon took Inseop\u2019s hand and made him hold his penis.\u201cDid you want to eat this?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, you drooled while I was filming.\u201dWhen Inseop tried to let go of his hand, Lee Wooyeon put his hand on top of him, immobilizing him.\u201cI\u2026 just\u2026\u201cChoi Inseop only pursed his lips as he couldn\u2019t come up with anything other than the expression he wanted to eat. Lee Wooyeon moved Inseop\u2019s hand. His genitals rubbed in the palm of his hand. His huge cock, which could not be grasped with one hand, slipped while stroking.As his desire hardened, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes became more and more erratic.\u201cInseop, I think I\u2019m going crazy.\u201dLee Wooyeon strangled his lustful desire. There was no way to last if he clung to him in this way.\u201c\u2026I wanted to eat\u2026\u201dLike a child learning to speak for the first time, he stammered, barely speaking a single word. As if Wooyeon had waited for the words, he inserted his genitals.Feeling the tightness, Lee Wooyeon exhaled a long breath.Inseop liked the moment when his well-groomed face was suddenly distorted. He had a clear feeling that he was greedy for him.\u201cI like\u2026\u201dInseop muttered without even realizing it. Lee Wooyeon lowered his body and said \u2018again\u2019, begging Inseop to say it again.\u201cI like you, ha, uh uh\u2026 Ha ha, like you.\u201dLee Wooyeon opened his eyes lightly as if savoring Inseop\u2019s words. At the sight of his dizzyingly sensual appearance, Inseop jumped up and felt uneasiness. He wanted to be confirmed.\u201cTell me please.\u201dAt Inseop\u2019s request, Lee Wooyeon slightly raised his eyebrows.\u201cI like you\u2026\u201dHe was anxious. Whenever pretty girls openly showed affection for him, when he thinks that he wasnot suitable for him, and above all, whenever he thinks that his love might disappear at some point, Inseop felt anxious and afraid.\u201cPlease tell me you like me. I want to hear it.\u201d\u201cI like you too.\u201dEvery time he spoke in broken syllables, Lee Wooyeon lifted his waist. Inseop took a deep breath and held onto his arm.\u201cI love it, haha, I want to eat your hole every day\u2026 I\u2019m the only one who will eat it, haa, no one can give it to you\u201dLee Wooyeon thrusted in again. Looking down at Inseop, he spit out his dark desires.\u201cUh, please, stop\u2026\u201dInseop covered his flushed face with his arm. Lee Wooyeon immediately removed Inseop\u2019s arm and made him look at him. He could see the persistence of not wanting to miss a single movement, breath, or gesture. It was a violent gaze.\u201cStop what Your hole is twitching because you like it too, shit, yeah, why is the bottom hole of a person who is not greedy so greedy, it drives me crazy.\u201dIt felt like his ears were on fire. In the end, Choi Inseop reached out. This was the only way to make Lee Wooyeon shut up.\u201c\u2026!\u201dHe bit his lips that barely touched.Inseop sucked the tip of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips little by little. He felt better. In fact, it occurred to him that he might have wanted to do this all along.From the moment he saw him kissing the female model, he wanted to taste Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips. Inseop closed his eyes and touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips.Veins stood out on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm as he lay on the bed. he lowered himselfThe kiss deepened.Choi Inseop\u2019s prediction was exactly right. Lee Wooyeon shut his mouth. With his chin tucked in like an angry man, he pushed down with all his might.\u201cAh,, ah.., yes, haa,, ah!\u201dIt was strength and speed that could not be compared to the back teasing earlier. He didn\u2019t even notice it entering.\u201cHuh, ah, it hurts, slowly\u2026\u201dThe top of his head thumped against the headboard, and his legs swayed helplessly in the air. He felt like dying. His dick was hot and twitching. Inseop didn\u2019t even realize that he was rubbing his genitals against Lee Wooyeon\u2019s stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes shone even more.\u201cHaa,Wooyeon, ah, it feels weird\u2026ugh.\u201dCloudy liquid flowed out from Inseop\u2019s penis, which was pressed against Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hard stomach. It was already the third ejaculation. Lee Wooyeon kissed his nose and lips without mercy and whispered.\u201cHaa, can I get you pregnant?\u201d\u201cAh, what\u2026:\u201cI\u2019ll cum inside you, and I\u2019ll impregnate you.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes, saying that, were not normal.Normally, he would have been ashamed to hear the man say that, but Inseop was also out of his mind. He was confused, afraid, embarrassed, scared. If he really left it as it was, he felt like Lee Wooyeon would impregnate him.Inseop finally burst into tears like a child.\u201cNo, no, no. Don\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s scary\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cry. It\u2019s okay, shh, let\u2019s do this.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm and made him hug him by the neck and whispered affectionately to him.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me, please. I won\u2019t hurt you, you know.\u201dInseop smiled and nodded his head slightly. After stroking Lee Wooyeon\u2019s back saying, \u201cYou\u2019re nice,\u201d he lifted Inseop up and tilted his back upward.\u201cWrap your leg around my waist. Ha, yes, like that.\u201dInseop, while trembling, did as the man told him to, lifting his leg and wrapping it around Wooyeon\u2019s waist. A creaking sound rang out.\u201cYou know what?\u201dLee Wooyeon kissed Inseop on the cheek and whispered.\u201cIf you have sex with your back lifted like this, my cock will go deep and you will get pregnant. Haa.. Fuck, I love it. Inseop. Ugh.\u201dLee Wooyeon pounded him wild like a beast. Sweat ran down his chin and landed on Inseop\u2019s eyes. Inseop blinked his eyes. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s figure was vaguely caught in his field of vision. Lee Wooyeon had eyes that could not have been more engrossed. His heart was pounding.\u201cInside\u2026 Can I cum inside?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked. Inseop nodded his head at the man\u2019s gaze looking at him affectionately. Lee Wooyeon slammed into his body.\u201c\u2014-!\u201dHot liquid poured into the hole wide open to the limit. Inseop held his breath and shivered. Lee Wooyeon groaned and held on to Inseop\u2019s thighs several more times and lifted his waist. At that time, the semen flowed inside.Blood slowly began to flow to his head. Inseop furrowed his eyebrows. Of course, he knew that he couldn\u2019t get pregnant because it was between men, but he was afraid of the semen flowing out of the hole. No matter how much it was packed, the semen that leaked out flowed through the gap.When Inseop moved his body, Lee Wooyeon finally made him loosen his legs. Thinking that he should hurry to the bathroom and wash up, Inseop tried to get himself up from the bed, but he was laid down on the bed again. Inseop was held in the man\u2019s firm arms, unable to budge, only wiggling on his toes.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice rang low.Especially when it came from behind like this. Inseop blinked his eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to wash up.\u201dA short laugh was heard from behind.\u201cWe still have a long way to go, so where are you going?\u201dAs if proving that, he felt something hard between his buttocks. Inseop shook his head and lifted his waist, saying that he couldn\u2019t, but to no avail.Before long, the sound of the two people\u2019s panting breaths began to echo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The man closed his eyes and swallowed a curse. The ringing, which was supposed to only ring a few times, continued insistently.In the end, Lee Wooyeon got up and found his cell phone among the clothes scattered on the floor. The moment he saw the name CEO Kim on the screen, he turned off the power without hesitation and threw the phone to the floor.\u201cWho\u2026\u201dInseop opened his eyes and asked. Lee Wooyeon replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a spam call,\u201d and then hugged Inseop in his arms again and laid down.Shortly thereafter, another cell phone rang. Inseop recognized his phone ringtone and tried to get up.\u201cIt\u2019s a spam call, don\u2019t answer it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to check who it is though\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way the bastard calling at a time like this has the right business.\u201dLee Wooyeon glanced at the wall clock and replied. It was 7 o\u2019clock in the morning. The ring was cut off.\u201cGo to sleep again.They had sex until dawn. Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop and patted him on the back. Inseop\u2019s breathing quieted down again. But the tranquility did not last long.The phone started ringing frantically again. Lee Wooyeon said fuck it and got up. He got up from the bed and looked for the ringing phone.Choi Inseop barely opened his sleepy eyes, and when he noticed Lee Wooyeon picking up his jacket, he got up.\u201cI-I-!\u201dBefore Lee Wooyeon could put his hand inside the jacket, Inseop threw himself. However, in the aftermath of yesterday\u2019s work, he couldn\u2019t walk properly and ended up getting stuck under the bed.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m okay. I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dInseop quickly wrapped the sheet around himself and stood up, snatching the jacket from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand. As he rummaged through his pockets, as expected, he felt the note he received yesterday.\u201cHave you hidden any gold?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and asked. Inseop calmly found his cell phone in the pocket on the other side and took it out.\u201cAh, no\u2026 It\u2019s CEP.\u201dChoi Inseop checked the name on the screen and muttered.\u201cDon\u2019t pick it up.\u201d Lee Wooyeon replied refreshingly.\u2018I\u2019m ten years older because of him. Before I met him, people thought I was in my early thirties, no, in my late twenties, let alone my forties.\u2019It was as if he could hear the voice of CEO Kim, who was earnestly expressing his pride and Lee Wooyeon\u2019s gossip. The ringing that had been cut off started to ring again.\u201cI guess I should pick up.\u201dInseop looked down at the screen with a worried expression. There was no phone call from CEO Kim during this time. He thought that the first call to Lee Wooyeon might be from CEO Kim. It was clear what had happened.\u201cI will take it.\u201dThe moment Inseop said that, Lee Wooyeon arbitrarily answered the call on the speaker phone. The timid Inseop froze.<\u2026 Lee Woo-yeon? Why are you answering? Isn\u2019t this Inseop\u2019s phone?>CEO Kim over the phone was clearly confused. Inseop\u2019s face was pale like he was sick. He didn\u2019t know what to say, so he just moved his lips.\u201cInseop stopped by because he had some business to do. We just finished.\u201dInseop looked at Lee Wooyeon with a look of admiration, who did not blink an eye, but changed his mind, thinking that this was not a believable lie.After all It was 7 o\u2019clock in the morning. On a day when there were no schedules, who would believe him if he said he had work to do at a time like this.<Ah\u2026. Well, I was going to send him to wake you up anyway\u2026 but fortunately.>Unexpectedly, however, CEO Kim was quickly convinced. Inseop sighed thinking that he was very lucky. And Lee Wooyeon from the side watched him with a smile on his eyes.\u201cWhat are you calling? At this hour.\u201dLee Wooyeon asked. It was a friendly tone, but there were thorns in it.<Uh, that\u2019s\u2026>CEO Kim blurted out his words in a hesitant manner.\u201cSince you called at this hour, it must be something important. Isn\u2019t it?\u201dJust try saying no. It was not difficult to guess the omitted word.A sigh came from CEO Kim over the phone. Choi Inseop beckoned Lee Wooyeon to hand over the phone.\u201cWhat happened, CEO?\u201dChoi Inseop asked as calmly as possible. When talking about work, he had to deal with it in an adult and cool way.<Lee Wooyeon seems to have a scandal.>\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh my gosh.\u201dLee Wooyeon snatched the cell phone from Inseop\u2019s hand.\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked calmly as if it was not his business.<It sounds like there will be a scandal\u2026 The article will be published tomorrow morning. >\u201cOh, really?\u201dLee Wooyeon replied, rubbing Inseop\u2019s frozen cheek with the back of his hand. Panicked at the word scandal, Inseop shook his hands.Where was the photo taken? He told him to be careful. What should they do? What should he do if Lee Wooyeon\u2019s life as an actor is ruined because of him?Inseop blinked his big eyes and looked up at Lee Wooyeon, as if he had finally come to his senses. Tears welled up in the black eyes.Lee Wooyeon said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d and continued the conversation, soothing Inseop.\u201cSo what?\u201d<\u2026 Are you okay?\u201cIs there a scandal that lasts more than a day or two? No one reads articles with only initials.\u201d<They\u2019re going with real names, not initials. And the other person\u2026>Inseop started to tremble like an aspen tree.Cute. Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop tightly and laughed, saying, \u201cIf I do well with this, I can tie Inseop down for the rest of my life.\u201d<\u2026 Because it\u2019s Chae Yeonseo.>\u201cHahahaha.\u201dLee Wooyeon shook his head and laughed. In his arms, Inseop raised his head with a more relieved expression when he was told that he was not the one with whom he had a scandal.\u201cWhy am I having a scandal with her?\u201dOpenly dissatisfied with Inseop\u2019s reassurance, Lee Wooyeon deliberately hugged Inseop tightly and asked.<That\u2019s right. Ha, why all of a sudden. Chae Yeonseo also has no luck\u2026 Anyway, that\u2019s what happened.>Lee Woo-yeon clicked his tongue, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201dChae Yeonseo, famous for her lovely appearance and innocent atmosphere, was a top actress who wrote an invincible myth in the advertising world for ten years. It would not be an exaggeration to say that she, a former child actress, is loved by the people for her outstanding acting skills and clean personal life.\u201cShe\u2019s dating Lee Cheolhwan.Inseop\u2019s eyes flashed with astonishment. If his memory was not wrong, Lee Cheolhwan was the name of the head of the drama division of Company N. He was a star PD whose success was so great that it would be impossible to count only the successful programs, and he was chosen as a strong candidate for the next CEO of Company N. Adding to the background of being the youngest son of the president of a certain media company, his influence in the broadcasting industry was unmatched.\u201cChief Lee, obviously\u2026\u201dInseop muttered with a blank face.<A married man. okay. That\u2019s the problem.>Director Lee Cheolhwan was famous for his flawless integrity and competent image. There was even a saying that even if only producers who respected him lined up, they would stay around the station. The moment you think you know everything about the entertainment industry, a world you don\u2019t know opens up\u2026 Well, the most representative person was right in front of him.Inseop looked up at Lee Wooyeon and swallowed the bitter taste.\u201cYou know everyone you need to know.\u201d<Knowing everything and being published in the article are two completely different matters.>It seemed that a picture was taken that could not be taken out. Either way, Lee Wooyeon was very annoyed with CEO Kim, who had woken them up from a sweet morning sleep over or something like that.\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal about that? Calling me at this hour. If you refute that, that\u2019s all. The CEO should publish the article on his own.\u201dSaying that, Lee Wooyeon tried to hang up the phone.<\u2026 It\u2019s a problem because you can\u2019t respond.>If it wasn\u2019t for CEO Kim\u2019s creeping words.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I refute?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice lowered.<Well, you couldn\u2019t appear in N company\u2019s drama because of that last time.>Inseop recalled that Lee Wooyeon had a car accident on purpose to come see him. Kang Youngmo\u2019s accident and the incident were intertwined, so the drama filming was completely canceled. However, it was the first time he had heard that company N banned him from appearing in a drama because of that.When Inseop opened his eyes wide, Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue.\u201cIt\u2019s not that it doesn\u2019t work, it just doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d<Hey, to be honest, we didn\u2019t make an official announcement, but you\u2019re banned. Because of that incident, I, ha\u2026 fine. What\u2019s the point of talking about the past?\u201d\u201cSo, why are you talking about the past? Annoying.\u201dLee Wooyeon frowned at the restless Inseop.<Anyway, since the current situation is over there, I decided to help you.>\u201cWow. So fuck, They can\u2019t handle it, so they\u2019re going to make a story with innocent me, right? With an appearance in a drama as bait?\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed with a face as sweet as cotton candy and spat out poisonous words.<\u2026 uh.>CEO Kim briefly affirmed. Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon with a nervous feeling.\u201cOur CEO intends to put me in that fucking scandal and sell me out coldly.\u201d<Hey! No! That\u2019s unfair! I just got a call too. Since this is urgent, I decided to write an article like this. As soon as I got the call, I called you\u2026 You didn\u2019t answer, but Inseop answered the phone.>\u201cI couldn\u2019t even get a good sleep, and I\u2019ve not eaten well last night, so I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear about this.\u201d<Hey! Even if you say something like that\u2026 Ha, Lee Wooyeon. Think carefully. It\u2019s not even a bad suggestion.>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad suggestion. Why bury such a bastard in my clean life?\u201c<It\u2019s so clean .. Hahaha, no, I mean, as you said, a scandal can happen for just a day or two.>The bad news that followed the perfect actor Lee Wooyeon was related to women.<Just pretend to know each other for a couple of months and then break up due to personality differences.>\u201cIf you hang out with an actor from a movie or drama like him, you\u2019ll see each other. I ask you to choose someone else\u201d<Will it be anyone?>A bigger scoop was needed to cover an article like that. It was difficult to find an actor of that level in Korea. It was clear that this decision was made after careful consideration. These transactions were not uncommon.Shortly after starting work, Manager Cha called Inseop over and said this. There were many things in the entertainment industry that were not understood by the common sense of ordinary people, so there was no need to try to understand them.\u2026Still, he doesn\u2019t know.Choi Inseop gently bit his lower lip.\u201cCEO\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice was low. Not only CEO Kim, but also Inseop, who was next to him, got nervous for a moment and straightened his body.<Why do you call me that again?>\u201cDo you know why I chose JN Entertainment?\u201d<Why is it?>Lee Wooyeon asked CEO Kim, who often complained bitterly to manager Cha, enraged, asking why he ignored so many entertainment companies and crawled into their company to fight for four months.\u201cIt\u2019s a company that doesn\u2019t let you do things you don\u2019t like. I respected the CEO\u2019s beliefs in his own way.\u201dIt was a lie. When he came to Korea and came to Cheongdam-dong, the first building that caught his eye was JN Entertainment. It started with an impure intention to upset his parents. He couldn\u2019t have chosen a company with such lofty intentions.A heavy silence fell over the phone. Although it was a scandalous transaction, as Lee Wooyeon said, this was also entertainment in a broad sense.<Yes. You don\u2019t have to do it if you don\u2019t feel like it.>In the industry, hosting and lobbying were common. Kim Hakseung, who watched such things with disgust while working as a model, vowed that he would never let anyone do such a thing if he became the company\u2019s representative. It was also a belief that he had kept unswayed by temptation until now.<Anyway, to hear that you chose our company and respected me for that reason, I\u2019m touched\u2026>\u201cHello? The phone connection is not good.\u201dAfter saying that, Lee Wooyeon hung up the phone without hesitation. He turned off the phone by pressing the power button.Lee Wooyeon threw his cell phone away and laid down on the bed.\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201dLee Wooyeon patted on the side to tell Inseop to lie down next to him.\u201cAre you all right?\u201dInseop asked carefully.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAnyway, if the article goes up \u2026 Heuk.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s wrist and hugged him. He put Inseop on top of him and put strength on his arm.\u201cLet\u2019s get some more.\u201d\u201cMr. Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u201d\u201cStop calling me Mr Lee Wooyeon. Was it not enough to call me that the whole day yesterday?Blood rushed to Inseop\u2019s face at the meaningful words.\u201cSleep. I\u2019m sleepy too.\u201dLee Wooyeon patted Inseop on the back and closed his eyes.Was he okay with the scandals? What happened to the ban on appearing in Company N? \u2026 What was he going to do next?There were a lot of things he wanted to ask, but Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face with his eyes closed was so calm that he couldn\u2019t say a single word.Inseop slowly closed his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In other words, it is not intentional to realize the result, but it is a deliberate act by determining that it will bear the result even if it is judged that it is possible to generate it.\u201cAre you out of your mind? Are you? What the hell were you thinking?\u201dCEO Hakseung Kim threw today\u2019s sports newspaper on the table and shouted.\u00a0The man, wearing a dark blue shirt, a light brown suit and a handkerchief in his pocket, looked like a rich D&G model.\u00a0Although he was close to forty, he did not look his age because of his well-maintained skin and muscular body exposed outside his luxurious suit.He shouted violently, messing up his hair which he got fixed this morning at the hair salon in Cheongdam-dong, where non-members had to wait a month even if they made a reservation.\u201cHow many times is this? Huh? The last time you almost got caught, Chief Cha barely managed to steer the reporter away. What did you say then?\u201d\u201cIt will never happen again.\u201dThe man, who was leaning deeply against the dark brown sofa, replied with a smile. It was a smile as refreshing as the scent of the air when a fresh orange was just peeled. The bright-colored hair made the man\u2019s charm stand out more.\u201cAnd I won\u2019t get caught.\u201dIt sounded confident. As if everything in the world was in his palm.\u201cYou won\u2019t get caught? Can\u2019t you see this with your eyes?\u201dCEO Kim Hakseung said, pointing to the article with the initials at the corner of page 16 of the entertainment page. It was about top star S enjoying a secret date with a new actress inside the car.\u201cWho would read the article on page 16?\u201d\u201cI would read it. Me.\u201d\u201cCEO, you\u2019re reading it because it\u2019s your job. No one is reading. No one.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t wrong, but CEO Kim Hakseung punched his chest. What he wanted to punch was actually the man sitting in front of him, but he only hit his heart repeatedly.The man sitting on the sofa looked down at the newspaper with an interested face as if he was reading another person\u2019s scandal.\u201cHow can a human being like that be the number one celebrity without any anti? Oh, my.\u201dIt sounded as if he didn\u2019t like that fact.\u201cThen you should be the first anti-fan.\u201dCEO Kim Hakseung\u2019s fist trembled at the man\u2019s words.People instinctively look at their own standards when making judgements about others. CEO Kim Hakseung has repeatedly said that everything that was subjective was bullshit. As soon as a thought goes through one\u2019s head and comes out of their mouth, he believed those words were bound to be subjective. Therefore, it was impossible to please people with different standards.But there was a person who made it possible. It was Lee Wooyeon sitting in front of CEO Kim Hakseung.Lee Wooyeon, who started his career in the entertainment industry with an independent film a few years ago, was an actor who was on a winning streak without a single slump. For the first time, he received more spotlight than the main character in a drama where he played the supporting role, and was immediately cast as the main character in a film directed by Park Seonghan, drawing public attention. After the movie was released, he did not expect his stock price to fall because his acting skills were excellent and the mask of strange charm that makes it difficult to determine nationality and age.Having won the Rookie of the Year award and the Best Actor award that year, he reached the top a year after entering the entertainment industry. It was the law of the entertainment industry to have ups and downs, but this did not apply to Lee Woo-yeon.Every drama he filmed exceeded 40% in viewers rating, every scenario he chose hit the jackpot, and the consumption effect of the advertisement he filmed made advertisers dance.There was also an editorial published in an economic journal that the product he advertises has received overwhelming support from consumers, especially female consumers, and that the brand Lee Wooyeon itself exists.People liked Lee Woo-yeon.Everyone liked his ingenuity, his rarely seen cute appearance, a beautiful smile that revealed his perfect teeth, excellent acting and singing skills, as well as praise from those who have worked with him at least once.The women especially loved his eyes. His eyes were loved greatly, with the deep futility of an old man who knew all of life\u2019s history and an innocence that was not worthy of his age at the same time. Some of his fans even said that Lee Woo-yeon\u2019s eyes should be designated as a national treasure and that if he dies, he should preserve the organ by any means. Opinions were divided on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s life. Little was known about his background except for the fact that he was a graduate of Princeton University. Interesting hypotheses such as the grandson of a famous foreign company, the illegitimate son of a famous actress, etc. have been circulated, but nothing has been confirmed. It was surprising for CEO Kim Hakseung that even such a mystery acted as his charm.However, it did not mean that Lee Wooyeon had no shortcomings. He liked women. He doesn\u2019t know who first used the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t block women who come, I don\u2019t catch women who go,\u201d but CEO Kim argued that Lee Wooyeon should go and pay royalties to that person.Although this scandal has been avoided, CEO Kim was concerned that it was not long before he occupied the front page of a sports newspaper if he was always like this. Lee Wooyeon always acted in his own way whether he liked it or not. When CEO Kim saw him like that, he grumbled that he lived like a man who would live for one day and die.\u201cPlease, live carefully. What are you going to do when your celebrity life ends?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m still thinking about what to do next.\u201d\u201cWhy did I trust and raise you?\u201dJN CEO Kim Hakseung often recalled the day when Lee Wooyeon visited the company and made a bold request to debut as an actor. Because of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face, which was too good to be dismissed as a madman, he called him back again when he was being chased out by the security.\u201cThis won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dLee Wooyeon said, looking through the article at the end of the newspaper. There was no doubt about the future in his smiling eyes. Lee Wooyeon was always like that. In his eyes, there was an unfounded determination.\u201cOf course there won\u2019t be. This article is on the front page.\u201dCEO Kim Hakseung said, spreading the front page of the sports newspaper back to the table.\u201cYou might have been on the front page if it weren\u2019t for this.\u201dThere was rather shocking content decorating the headline.\u201cGirl idol. Jumped from the agency building. Suicide again?\u201dChief Cha, who was sitting opposite Lee Wooyeon, muttered while reading the front page with a pale face.An article saying that a female idol jumped from the roof of the building early this morning and died was decorated with all kinds of provocative phrases. Lee Wooyeon sat there with a disinterested face.\u201cAnd as of yesterday,Chief Kim resigned.\u201d\u201cAgain?\u201dChief Cha was surprised and asked.\u201cYes,again, again, again.\u201dCEO Kim Hakseung added, grinding his teeth. It was already the eighth time this year. The life of a manager with irregular life and unclear income is not very long. If you work under a large entertainment company, it is called The God\u2019s Workplace in the manager industry because you receive not only the four major insurances but also bonuses regularly. Among them, JN provides the best annual salary and treatment in the industry, so it has been crowded with people who want to join there as a manager. There were many people who dreamed of setting up their own entertainment business later \u00a0because working for a good company naturally increased networking and learning skills.In particular, the better the popularity of the celebrity he is in charge of, the more it was in line with the manager\u2019s power. The better the celebrity he was in charge of, the more proud he felt and worked harder.The fact that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, who is the best in Korea, continues to change meant that Lee Wooyeon was the problem after all.However, Lee Wooyeon was a celebrity famous for his good personality. Lee Wooyeon, who has been in the top spot for several years as the celebrity best suited for coffee commercials, was well-received by those around him.\u00a0He was never late, and he was always polite to the staff. It was common for people to be humble when they were rookies, but as they became more popular, their nose bridge became higher. In the case of Lee Wooyeon, he was always polite and was popular among the people he worked with.\u201cThis is all because of your dirty personality!\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dLee Wooyeon replied with a smile. He looked so gentle and good-looking. However, CEO Kim knew the gutter-like personality hidden under the angel-like mask.\u201cHow did you bother him?\u201d\u201cMe? I\u2019ve never done that. Did Chief Kim say that on his way out? Are you saying I harassed him?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen Chief Kim quit, he did not say a word blaming Lee Wooyeon. He just disappeared after saying that he was incompetent and lacking, and that he would no longer be able to work as a manager.\u201cLook at that.\u201dLee Wooyeon said, taking out his cell phone with a long, elegant finger. As soon as he saw Lee Wooyeon, who looked like he knew it, CEO Kim cursed a thousand times.Managers who were in charge of Lee Wooyeon resigned for the same reason.\u00a0They said that they felt they were not good enough to take on the role of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, the best star in Korea, and said they were sorry.That\u2019s once or twice, but it\u2019s been eight times this year alone, so CEO Kim couldn\u2019t help but suspect Lee Wooyeon. Surely that devilish man did something behind the scenes to make the innocent managers quit. How on earth did he cleverly burn a person\u2019s insides? Doubts grew like Jack\u2019s bean sprouts.\u201cDon\u2019t say that anymore, like my manager quitting because I was bothering him. CEO.\u201d\u201cThen why do they all resign for the same reason?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that either.\u201dIn fact, Lee Woo-yeon was not a good person.\u00a0Although he deceived people with his good impression and soft tone, he was a human being who lacked expression simply by saying that he had a bad personality.\u00a0And he did not dare pretend to be a good person in front of CEO Kim.It was like that even now. Lee Wooyeon did not express any emotion even when it was reported that a person in the same entertainment industry committed suicide.\u201cBy the way, something happened to her and she jumped from the building. What the.\u201dDirector Cha read the article with his tongue-in-cheek. \u00a0He clenched his tongue and shook his head sadly.\u00a0Still then, Lee Wooyeon was still texting on his cell phone with an indifferent face.\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the case. Anyway, it\u2019s unfortunate. At a young age.\u201dSaying that, CEO Kim glanced at Lee Wooyeon. When their eyes met, Lee Wooyeon said with a polite coffee-flavored smile.\u201cThere\u2019s an order when you come, but there\u2019s no order when you go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, but she\u2019s already dead. What can I do?\u201dIf he could, CEO Kim Hakseung wanted to wrap his head and lie down right now. He\u2019s talking without thinking.\u201cAre you a man without a heart?\u201d\u201cNo way. I was just saying that you both shouldn\u2019t give up.\u201dIf you don\u2019t know about Lee Wooyeon, it was a voice that could fool you. However, CEO Kim Hakseung knew the gutter hidden in that slick mask.\u201cIt breaks my heart to think about how hard it must have been to make such a choice at her prime.\u201dLee Wooyeon mutters, pressing near his chest with his palm. It was a pitiful tone that made it hard to believe that it was the same person as the person who was discussing the order of dying just before.CEO Kim and Director Cha were the only people who knew Lee Wooyeon\u2019s true self. The two also knew that the voice of Lee Wooyeon, who touched their hearts just now, was all made up.Seriously, Lee Wooyeon did not feel as much sympathy for the dead woman as his fingernails. Lee Woo-yeon was such a human being.\u201cI\u2019ve got a black suit ready. Go and come back.\u201dAs soon as CEO Kim finished his words, Lee Wooyeon turned his head with a strange look.\u201cYou have to go to a place like that and pay your respects to improve your reputation.\u201d\u201cDo I have a reputation to improve?\u201d\u201cYou have to go even if you\u2019re lazy. There\u2019s also the face of our agency.\u201d\u201cWho said it was annoying? Of course I have to go.\u201dSaying that, like he was annoyed to death, Lee Wooyeon stood up from his seat.\u201cDirector Cha will take you home. I\u2019ve prepared a black suit, a dress shirt, shoes, and glasses without prescription. And when he takes you home, the manager who will work tomorrow will come, drive you, and say bye, so don\u2019t bother him.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t bother anyone.\u201dNo matter how much Lee Wooyeon says that ,CEO Kim was convinced that he must have acted behind the scenes for the managers to resign one after another.\u201cReporters will gather, so take care of yourself. Don\u2019t make useless things happen.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dLee Wooyeon turned his head and asked with a face what it really was.\u201cGirls.\u201d\u201cAh, girls.\u201dWith his head slightly down, he laughed. The women melted into his quiet, pleasing voice that touched their ears. In the entertainment industry, it was not difficult to find men who were more handsome or had better proportions than Lee Woo-yeon. But one of the numerous reasons why he did not come down from the top even though he was not a splendid handsome man was his voice.The actresses who filmed a drama or movie together praised Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice. It was their slightly bluffed argument that if he confessed his love in their ear, no woman would have a choice but to fall for it.Lee Wooyeon knew better than anyone else how his voice was heard by the other person. He asked, with a soft laugh like melted chocolate.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a punk who\u2019ll cause problems with women at a funeral? Me\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI can see it, you punk.CEO Kim swallowed what he wanted to say and motioned for him to leave. Lee Wooyeon smiled and said goodbye and disappeared. CEO Kim took out the medicine, put it in his mouth, and poured water into the cup for the headache that was rushing in. Chief Cha paused for a while and asked carefully.\u201cWhat kind of person is the new manager? CEO.\u201dCEO Kim Hakseung, after swallowing the water, replied.\u201cSomeone who will never quit.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He came here after President Kim\u2019s order to closely monitor Lee Wooyeon, but the funeral home was very uncomfortable. Reporters lingering near the funeral home trying to catch a story, and female idols who were secretly fighting in the midst of this were also tired.It\u2019s been over ten years since he\u2019d worked on this floor, but at times like this, he felt skeptical about the place. He felt a vibration in his pocket. Manager Cha put his cigarette in his mouth and pulled out his cell phone.\u201cYes. This is Cha Hyungyu. Oh yes. I\u2019m in front of the hospital\u2019s front door, so come over here. Call me when you arrive. Alright.\u201dAfter the call, he put out the cigarette he was holding. It seems that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, who was supposed to start work today, arrived.He had a quiet and calm voice. The words of CEO Kim, someone who will never quit, came to mind.\u201cTsk, I have no luck.\u201dLee Wooyeon had a bad personality. The only people who knew the true nature of that person were Kim and himself. At first, Manager Cha also thought that Woo-Yeon Lee was an angel that could never exist. Seeing his consistently sincere, polite, and humble behavior, he told other celebrities working in the same agency to watch and learn from Lee Wooyeon. It was by accident that they discovered the dark secrets hidden in the angel\u2019s skin.Cha Hyungyu took out a new cigarette from the pack and lit it. Poisonous cigarette smoke rushed into his lungs.\u201cWhat. Oh, it\u2019s Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a celebrity, a celebrity. The good looking Lee Wooyeon.\u201dAs the waiter opened the door, the people outside seemed to be able to see the scene inside the room. Two men passing by suddenly raised their heads and spoke. It was rare for drunk people, especially men, to part quietly when they saw a male celebrity.When CEO Kim offered to buy alcohol to commemorate the successful end of a drama he had filmed a while ago, it was situations like this that Lee Wooyeon expressed his concern about. But the CEO said he would prepare a good room, so he should come.Because it\u2019s the CEO\u2019s who said this, Lee Wooyeon reluctantly followed. It was a special place prepared by CEO Kim for Lee Wooyeon, who only goes to and from the filming site when working, and from home to the gym when taking a break. It was Kim\u2019s advice that, sometimes, one needs to open their world like this to increase their charm. For Kim Hakseung, the CEO of JN, who is known to be strict at work, to say this to the rookie Lee-Woo Yeon, he felt that he should listen.The waiter panicked and tried to close the door, but the men had already recklessly entered the room.\u201cOh, you look good in real life. You\u2019re Lee Wooyeon from \u2018Something in the Wind\u2019 right? Nice to meet you.\u201dLee Wooyeon got up from his seat without showing any displeasure, answered yes, and reached out his hand to ask for a handshake.\u201cMy niece likes you. Please give me some autographs. Let\u2019s take some pictures, no, no, give me your phone number. I\u2019ll call my nephew later.\u201d\u201cI will do it later. I\u2019m with other people right now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon bowed his head politely. But it didn\u2019t matter to the men who had already reached the point of intoxication.\u201cWhat? Are you saying you won\u2019t sign this?\u201d\u201cAh, fuck. You\u2019re playing hard to get.\u201dCEO Kim\u2019s expression darkened at the bleak atmosphere. The waiter hurriedly tried to get the men out of the room, but to no avail.\u201cGuests. This is where other guests are, so you have to leave.\u201d\u201cYou bastard. Don\u2019t you know who I am? Is this Mr. Song\u2019s shop? Are you doing this because you don\u2019t know who\u2019s looking after Song?\u201d\u201cShut up when I say something nice. You asshole.\u201dAt first glance, they were men who did not have good personality. While the waiter did not know what to do, the man started arguing with Lee Wooyeon again.\u201cIs it that hard to sign autographs?\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dEveryone in the room knew it wasn\u2019t a request that ended in autographs.\u201cYou\u2019re just a rookie and you can\u2019t even give an autograph?\u201dCEO Kim beckoned to the Manager. Manager Cha got up quickly and tried to sort out the situation.\u201cSorry. This guy is too drunk to sign autographs. Please understand.\u201d\u201cDrunk?\u201dThe man looked at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face carefully. He drank a few drinks, but not enough to get drunk. Lee Woo-yeon bowed his head once again to apologize.\u201cThen pour me a drink or two.\u201dThe man said as he raised a glass that was on the table.\u201cEven if you\u2019re drunk, you will be able to pour a drink. Let\u2019s have a drink served by a celebrity. I\u2019ll drink that and leave.\u201dLee Wooyeon hesitated for a moment, then grabbed a bottle of liquor and filled the glass. When the glass was filled with high-quality western liquor, the man exclaimed, \u201cStop,\u201d as if satisfied. The man who was holding a glass to his thick lips suddenly called out to Lee Wooyeon, saying, \u201cHey.\u201dThe man poured the alcohol on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face. It happened in an instant. Alcohol flowed down Lee Woo-yeon\u2019s sharp jawline.\u201cYou bastard with no manners.\u201dThe man threw the glass on the table and left the room. The waiter bowed his head to bring a towel and left.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dCEO Kim asked. Lee Wooyeon replied with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cOh really. There are people like that everywhere.\u201dThe manager of the car pulled out a handkerchief from his pocket and tried to wipe his face. Lee Woo-yeon raised his hand and pushed the manager\u2019s handkerchief away.\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou put your handkerchief away. If you bring me a towel, I will wipe with it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. This was a place for you to feel good.\u201dCEO Kim Hakseung offered an apology. Lee Wooyeon responded with a polite, cool smile.\u201cNo. CEO. I think this is also a social experience.\u201dCEO Kim and Director Cha felt apologetic as they wondered if there was such a person. Lee Wooyeon thanked the waiter who brought the towel as well. Looking back, the waiter didn\u2019t close the door right away, so this unfortunate incident happened, but he didn\u2019t show any annoyance, let alone get angry. The waiter bowed his head repeatedly and apologized. Not long after, even the manager came and offered an apology.\u201cWho are they? Those people.\u201dCEO Kim asked in an irritated voice. The manager only returned an apology reply. The man who said that he knew the owner of the place didn\u2019t seem like he was lying.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Once the alcohol dries up, I\u2019ll go home and take a shower anyway. Stop it.\u201dThe manager said that he won\u2019t be charging them for the drinks today, so they can order as they wish and then he disappeared. CEO Kim was annoyed and lit a cigarette.\u201cI think you have become famous though. For people to recognize you like that.\u201dWhen the manager Cha tried to lighten the mood with a joke, Lee Wooyeon replied with a smile.It was not uncommon for people to argue when they saw celebrities outside. It was the celebrities who had a lot to lose if they got into an argument. So it was best to just be patient in a place like this. In particular, it was best to avoid those of poor quality, as they even threaten them when something happens.Lee Wooyeon roughly wiped the alcohol with a towel. Outside the door, he saw the man passing by who had just argued with them.\u201cI\u2019m going to wash up.\u201d\u201cAre you going to leave like that?\u201d\u201cThe bathroom is right in front, so it will be fine.\u201dLee Wooyeon went out. The manager sighed and said.\u201cOh, he\u2019s so gentle, I\u2019m worried if he\u2019ll get through this rough world well in the future.\u201d\u201cNo. Even if it looks like that, that guy is quite strong. He will definitely become bigger.\u201dHe was put in a small role in the drama, but the response from the viewers was amazing, so the writer eventually changed the story and he became a major supporting role. He even received more spotlight than the lead, and rumors circulated that the lead said he would never work with Lee Wooyeon again.CEO Kim, who has been working here for a long time, trusted his senses. Lee Wooyeon was a big fish. This was just the beginning.\u201cThe response is good this time, and I\u2019m sure there will be better work next time, right?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to choose wisely. If we don\u2019t, his image will be negatively affected.\u201d\u201cYes. A lot of scripts have come in for Lee Wooyeon, haven\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard of a few, but I\u2019ll have to check them out.\u201d\u201cIt would be fine to shoot a good movie, but \u2026But why isn\u2019t he back yet? Could it be that he is in another argument again?\u201dAs soon as Managerr Cha finished speaking, CEO Kim stood up. Since there were other people around, they stopped pouring the drinks on Lee Wooyeon, but now that he was alone, who knows what those thugs would do.The two ran to the bathroom. He could not find Lee Wooyeon, who they thought would be in the bathroom.\u201cCall him.\u201dManager Cha quickly took out his cell phone and called Lee Wooyeon. When the call was not answered, the manager Cha anxiously called several more times, but in vain.\u201cOh, damn it. What happened? Call the manager here. If they don\u2019t bring those bastards right away, I\u2019ll report them to the police\u2026\u201dBefore Kim could finish speaking, the sound of something breaking was heard from inside the emergency exit connected to the end of the hallway. They both ran towards it at the same time. Manager Cha muttered that it was foolish of them to let him go to the bathroom alone.CEO Kim pushed the heavy iron door back and called out Lee Wooyeon\u2019s name.\u201cWooyeon-ah! Are you oka\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon was there. But not the Lee Wooyeon they knew.At his feet, the gangster who poured liquor on him was lying down with white foam on his mouth. Lee Wooyeon, who had been kicking the man who had lost consciousness and collapsed, looked back without showing any signs of surprise. There was blood all over his smiling face.\u201cBlood\u2026\u201dManager Cha, unable to speak properly, points to his face with his finger, and Lee Wooyeon wiped it away with his palm. And then let out a low laugh.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not my blood.\u201dHe kicked the head of the man one more time. At the same time, CEO Kim and Manager Cha frowned and grimaced unknowingly. Lee Wooyeon continued wiping the blood on his shoes on the man\u2019s clothes.\u201cWhy did you come? It\u2019s cold.\u201d\u201c\u2026you didn\u2019t come, so we were worried that something happened\u2026\u201dManager Cha stuttered over his words with a look of disbelief. This was something that was obviously worrying. Looking at t he man who was lying down besides Lee Wooyeon, it looked like he needed at least seven weeks to recover from the dislocations he had.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dEven after seeing the situation in front of him, CEO Kim could not believe what he was seeing. The two of them didn\u2019t know how to react to the unexpected transformation of an angelic Lee Wooyeon, who never showed any anger, and had a smile on his face no matter what.\u201cWe ran into each other on the way to the bathroom.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRelax. I made sure there was no cctv over here, and I hit him from behind so he wouldn\u2019t even know it was me. There will be no fingerprints left.\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed at the beer bottle lying on the floor with a friendly glance. He also had leather gloves on his hands. Why did he go wearing leather gloves to the bathroom? He wondered whether this really was a coincidence.CEO Kim and Manager Cha looked at each other..Are you really saying that this person is Lee Wooyeon? Is Lee Wooyeon the person they knew, with a face that seemed unable to kill an ant and spitting out bloody words with a soft tone?It was unbelievable even if he saw it with his eyes and heard it with his own ears.\u201c\u2026I really don\u2019t know.\u201dIt was a word from CEO Kim with complex meaning.\u201cAny more questions?\u201dLee Wooyeon showed no sign of embarrassment or shame despite revealing his ugly side. He took off his blood-soaked leather gloves like it was a natural behavior and handed it to the manager.\u201cPlease throw it away. It\u2019s a bit dangerous if I carry it.\u201d\u201c\u2026okay.\u201dThe manager accepted the leather gloves with a shaky face.\u201cThen let me go in first.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was passing by the two of them, seemed to remember something, reached out to the manager and said.\u201cPlease lend me a handkerchief.\u201d\u201c\u2026uh.\u201dAs if possessed by something, Manager Cha took out his handkerchief and handed it to him. Lee Wooyeon, who wiped the blood off his face with the handkerchief, handed it back to the manager.\u201cPlease throw this away too.\u201dThen he closed the iron door and disappeared.The two got to know the real him at that moment. The Lee Wooyeon, who politely refused because the manager\u2019s handkerchief would be dirtied, also disappeared.From that day on, Lee Wooyeon stopped pretending to be nice in front of the two of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He thought that Lee Wooyeon must have had something to do with his manager quitting after a few months. However, even as he resigned, the manager consistently said that it was not Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fault and that he was too incompetent to work anymore.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing\u2026\u201dManager Cha clicked his tongue. Lee Wooyeon was someone who did things behind other people\u2019s backs.It was two months that his manager lasted the most. Of course, when celebrities change managers too often, they don\u2019t look good. CEO Kim cautioned him several times, but each time, he only shrugged and said that he had done nothing.However, CEO Kim and Manager Cha thought it was clear that he did something out of sight. But they couldn\u2019t figure out what that \u2018something\u2019 was.Manager Cha scratched his head as he remembered the words of CEO Kim that he had hired someone who would never quit. What kind of a human being is he who never quits?Is it someone who trained in the mountains? Or is it someone from the paratroopers? Hmmm, when he heard his voice, he seemed to have a calm and kind personality. Did he have to sign a contract that said he would never quit because he was in a hurry?The cell phone rang. Manager Cha quickly answered the phone, thinking that the person who could satisfy his curiosity had finally appeared.\u201cHello, Manager Cha\u2026Yes? I beg your pardon? Where are you? Alright. I\u2019ll go right away. Yes.\u201dManager Cha quickly ended the call. Immediately the bell rang again. Manager Cha caught the sight of a shabby-looking young man looking around with his cell phone in his hand.\u201cExcuse me. This way.\u201dHe gestured to the young man. The young man who found the car manager hurriedly put his cell phone in his pocket and walked over towards him.\u201cHello. From today\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you Inseop Choi, who will be working as Wooyeon Lee\u2019s manager from today?\u201dManager Cha intercepted the greeting that came out of the man\u2019s mouth. He knows it\u2019s rude, but that\u2019s how urgent the manager was.\u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d\u201cTake this at once.\u201dThe manager handed over the car key and notebook and continued.\u201cAll you have to do today is greet Lee Wooyeon and take him home. He\u2019ll probably be out in thirty minutes. Lee Wooyeon doesn\u2019t have a schedule for tomorrow, so you can come to the office first. You don\u2019t need anything special to take care of him, just cold coffee and an Americano. Some things to be aware of are here. You can see the details in that notebook.\u201d\u201cYes Yes.\u201dChoi Inseop barely nodded his head at the words that poured like a storm without a break.\u201cI have to go because there is an emergency right now. Call me if anything happens. Do you know my phone number?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen see you later.\u201dThe manager, who was about to run, suddenly turned around and added a word.\u201cBe careful.\u201d\u201cYes? \u2026Yes.\u201dBefore hearing his proper answer, Manager Cha hurriedly ran away. Choi Inseop, who was laid out in front of the hospital\u2019s front door, stood for a long time holding the notebook and car key he was randomly handed over.Only after bumping shoulders with a passerby did Choi Inseop suddenly realize what the situation was in front of him.\u201cYou have to calm down. Now, this is the beginning.\u201dHe calmly took the camera out of his pocket and took pictures of the car keys he was holding, followed by his notebook.Click click click.The sound of the shutter rang quietly.When he heard that a new manager was coming, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t even care. He was going to quit in a few months anyway.He was used to wearing a mask in front of people. He thought that the job he chose was to wear a mask, and his daily life was an extension of his job. However, due to the nature of the job, the manager, who was by his side almost all day except for sleeping, definitely bothered him.Most of all, he hated seeing the same person every day for a long time. Even women, he got tired of seeing them three or four times, but having to spend the day with the same person every day was unreasonable in nature. He can\u2019t just fire someone for no reason, though. In the end, Lee Wooyeon picked on people without being obvious. The expression \u201cburn,\u201d was a phrase he heard from a model nurse.Burn it. To a crispMaking it impossible to recognize where the heat was coming from, Lee Wooyeon burned people up. He induced the manager to make mistakes by leaking the wrong schedule or by giving the wrong appointment time on purpose. With thoroughly calculated actions, managers make mistakes over and over again. Each time, Lee Wooyeon exhorted his manager, saying it was okay with a gentle and loving smile. More and more, managers were busily trying to make up for their mistakes. However, if several small mistakes are made, and one big one is rolled up, the manager\u2019s spirit is bound to die. At that time, Lee Wooyeon personally calls the manager and buys him a drink and talks to him in a friendly manner. \u2018I trust you, it\u2019s okay, next time make sure this doesn\u2019t happen, no matter what anyone says, I\u2019m by your side. You are different from other people. I know. So please be patient. Of course, that must never happen again\u2019. Thats the way for him.When Lee Wooyeon, who was rumored to not make personal acquaintances with the manager because the distinction between public and private was clear, turned out to be like that, the person is moved to tears. The next day, the manager, who had gathered up his courage, appears and is full of enthusiasm. Lee Wooyeon responds with a smile. His chest swells at the feeling of being trusted personally by the best celebrity. Things seem to be going well. It makes the manager feel better. A few days go by without any problems. The manager thinks he\u2019s getting used to the job, and the tone of his voice gets brighter. Lee Wooyeon is waiting. The moment when a person is drunk with joy and slightly loses the voice of reason.It was good then. The moment when a person who used to be proud of himself collapses as soon as he realizes that he has made the same mistake again.Lee Wooyeon, who should be the victim of a mistake, makes a strange expression at that moment. A friendly smile that shows a bit of resentment, bitterness, and disappointment toward the other person, but still shows consideration.Some people stop there. People who are ignorant may hold on to it longer, but in the end, they will raise a white flag saying that they can\u2019t do it.He doesn\u2019t want to have anyone by his side for a long time, but Lee Wooyeon enjoyed the process of people falling apart. Human psychology is complex, but the process of manipulating it was simpler than expected. Changing managers frequently was not good for image formation, but it was unavoidable. Because he enjoys the process of cutting people off.So he can\u2019t quit\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201dA woman\u2019s voice reached his ears. Lee Wooyeon smiled and shook his head. It seems that he uttered the words in his heart without knowing it.\u201cWhat are you doing tomorrow?\u201dAt the funeral, a woman who was much younger than Lee Wooyeon, had come, dressed in luxury clothes, meticulously made-up, and even her hair, asked with a young voice.\u201cI have a schedule for tomorrow.\u201dTomorrow was a very rare day with no schedule. He had no intention of missing such a golden vacation for a woman like this.\u201cOppa. So what about today? What are you doing tonight?\u201dAlthough they were not in the same group, he heard that they had a similar debut period and had an overlapping activity period, so they knew each other. Lee Wooyeon watched with pleasure as a woman in a black suit, who had been crying as if her best friend had died, found him and ran to him, throwing seductive words.\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be good today. Yura must also be heartbroken today, so please rest at home. Sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon looked at the man who had been waiting for him since a while ago, bowed his back and whispered. The voice that reached her ear loosened her legs, and Jo Yura nodded her head with a blank face.\u201cSee you next time.\u201dJo Yura blushed at the greeting as the wind gently brushed the leaves, and blankly watched his back as he walked off.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dWhen a soft, low voice spoke, the man standing in front of him straightened his posture and raised his head. From the eyes carefully examining him, Lee Wooyeon was able to roughly grasp the tendencies of the other.A kind, sincere, and uninteresting human being.The new manager was Kim\u2019s preference. He liked a good man who worked hard. It was the type that was the best prey for Lee Wooyeon.Lee Wooyeon held out his hand.\u201cI\u2019m Lee Wooyeon. I wish you all the best in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe new manager had a visibly hardened face and didn\u2019t say anything. Sometimes people who see celebrities in front of them are so nervous that they can\u2019t say anything.Lee Wooyeon acts kinder and more courteous when that happens, relieving the opponent\u2019s tension. That way it tastes better when burned later.\u201cIt\u2019s cold today, but you had a hard time coming. We met in a bad place.\u201dLee Wooyeon held his hand first. When the warmth touched his frozen hands, Choi Inseop was startled, as if on fire.\u201cI, I\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Lee Wooyeon.\u201dGiving strength to his hand and shaking hands, Lee Wooyeon greeted him again.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m Choi Inseop.\u201dThe new manager only revealed his name. Perhaps because of his shy personality, he kept his face down. Lee Wooyeon pulled out his hand first. Choi Inseop looked down at his hand blankly. He had a look on his face that he couldn\u2019t believe the situation in front of him.\u201cThen please.\u201dLee Wooyeon opened the car door by hand and spoke politely again. Choi Inseop answered yes and went to the driver\u2019s seat and sat down.Sitting in the back seat, leaning back, Lee Wooyeon watched the new manager\u2019s driving skills. Turning the steering wheel was pretty good. Driving skills were also something to check. One of the manager\u2019s important tasks was to quickly move the actor in charge with safe driving within the set time. Sometimes, there were people who deliberately recognized celebrities\u2019 cars and caused accidents. Celebrities, whether they did something wrong or not, became a problem in and of themselves when people talked about bad things. This is because people value how much more provocative it is than just whether it is true or not.A manager with poor driving skills is better off making mistakes with his car. But with this manager, he didn\u2019t think that would work. It was hard to find any gaps in the way he was driving, looking around the front and rear calmly.It doesn\u2019t matter. If he waits slowly and watches, there will be a corner where he will make a mistake in anything. If not, he can create it.Lee Wooyeon buried his face in the sheet and closed his eyes. The manager, who was driving quietly, asked carefully if he could play music.He thought it was surprising. A person like him, who couldn\u2019t even introduce himself properly, suddenly says he\u2019s going to play music.Lee Wooyeon hated listening to music that didn\u2019t suit his taste. The reason that the sixth manager was kicked out by accident and why he used very tough means within two weeks was because he always played a female idol\u2019s song loudly in the car.It was better to catch a taxi than to listen to music that didn\u2019t suit his taste. However, he couldn\u2019t reveal it in front of the manager who he met for the first time.\u201cYes. Do whatever you feel comfortable with.\u201dAs soon as Lee Wooyeon\u2019s permission was granted, he put the CD that he brought into the car audio system. Lee Wooyeon frowned slightly. He was annoyed that the music of a female idol would be playing. It was dark in the car, so his expression couldn\u2019t be seen, so he thought he was lucky and closed his eyes.As the familiar music flowed, Lee Wooyeon slowly opened his eyes.Historia de un amor. The story of a love.It was his favorite song. There was no way the manager knew about it and played it, but it was a pleasant coincidence. Lee Wooyeon closed his eyes again and listened to the song.Because of his good driving skills, even the shaking of the car felt good.My love, you are no longer with me\u2026Do you love more and hurt more? \u2026It was the reason for my existence\u2026 Give me all good and evil\u2026I can\u2019t live.Lyrics that were heard unconsciously were repeated. At the end of the repetition, which he does not know how many times, a quiet voice was heard.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dWhen he opened his eyes, it was an underground parking lot. Choi Inseop got out of the driver\u2019s seat and opened the car door. In a friendly voice, Lee Wooyeon said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he added, saying thank you.\u201cYou drive well.\u201d\u201c\u2026I practiced.\u201dA cautious reply came back. Lee Wooyeon laughed. Are there people who practice driving just to get into the manager\u2019s position? He couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for him.Lee Wooyeon turned his head to see the pathetic human\u2019s face.Like a student being punished in the office, he carefully looked at the face of the man standing with his hands in front of him.He had the same face as a boy who had not grown up because of the freckles that were shining through his white skin. Looking at his restless expression whether he was frightened, Lee Wooyeon thought that this one would be fun to burn in its own way.\u201c\u2026!\u201dWhen their eyes met, the new manager turned his head. Lee Wooyeon said then, bowed his head and turned around.\u201cThank you.\u201dAt the greeting from behind, Lee Wooyeon felt a little puzzled. What does he mean thank you?However, the thought of the new manager soon disappeared from his mind. In the first place, he wasn\u2019t the type to be interested in other people.\u201cGoodbye.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dUntil Lee Wooyeon disappeared into the elevator, Choi Inseop stood there and watched his back.A familiar envelope caught Lee Wooyeon\u2019s attention as he looked through the mail he pulled out of the mailbox. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s real name was written on the off-white high-quality paper in neat handwriting.Phillip Levin.The name that even he had forgotten is recalled from his memory through a letter he receives once a month. He opened the envelope with unhesitating hand movements.There was only one picture. A picture of himself in high school. On the back of the photo, a verse of Rilke\u2019s poem is written in neat handwriting. Lee Wooyeon snorts and pushes the photo to the back of the mail.It was the mail that he received once a month since he came to Korea and became a celebrity. Lee Wooyeon, who didn\u2019t blink at anything, felt a bit nervous when he first received the letter because he didn\u2019t tell anyone about his origins. What\u2019s more, the letter contained a photo of him from his high school days. Thinking it was a new threat, he waited for the criminal to approach. But no one contacted him asking for money. It has been the same ever since.Once a month.A picture and a poem were all. No demands or threats, just that. It had been a year since he started receiving letters that Lee Wooyeon stopped digging up the identity of the sender of the letter. He learned that the letter did no harm to him in any way.At first, when a letter arrived, he threw it in the trash or crumpled it and burned it without opening it, but these days he sometimes checked the contents inside.\u201cRilkera\u2026\u201dThe woman in the elevator who heard Lee Wooyeon\u2019s murmur glanced back. Lee Wooyeon showed a friendly smile to hide his stiff expression and bowed his head. A woman he had met in the elevator several times recognized Lee Wooyeon and blushed.After the woman said hello and got off the elevator, Lee Wooyeon returned to his original expressionless face.The elevator arrived on the 49th floor. Lee Wooyeon, out of habit, put his hand in his pocket to find his cell phone, and then pressed the elevator button again. It seemed like the phone had dropped out of his pocket in the car. Even if he goes now, there was little chance that the manager would still be there, but just to confirm\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201dThe moment the elevator door opened in the underground parking lot, Lee Wooyeon stopped in his tracks. Choi Inseop was standing in front of the elevator.\u201cBecause you left your phone behind\u2026\u201dSeeing him holding out his cell phone with both hands like a person presenting precious treasures, Lee Wooyeon was shocked.\u201cThank you. But how did you did find it. It would have been in the back seat.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, there\u2026I was trying to clean the back seat\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon reached out and picked up the phone. All he could think about was that the new manager\u2019s needlessly clean personality made it easier for him to do some troublesome work.Choi Inseop, who stood there, added a few more words incase he thought his explanation was insufficient.\u201cI never looked at the back seat because I had other thoughts\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you. Then I\u2019ll go in.\u201dLee Wooyeon was no longer in the mood to talk to anyone. Fatigue piled up to the top of his head. Wearing a mask of a friendly face gradually came to a limit. After waving goodbye to the manager, Lee Wooyeon got on the elevator again and went up.As soon as he took off his shoes in front of the front door and stepped into the house, his phone rang.Kim, it was the representative.He wondered if he would answer it, but because of his personality, it was clear that he would call until he answered, so Lee Wooyeon meekly pressed the answer button.\u201cYes. CEO.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything special that happened today?\u201d\u201cNothing happened.\u201dLee Wooyeon took off the jacket he was wearing and threw it on the sofa and answered.\u201cHow about the new kid?\u201d\u201cWho? Ah, the manager.\u201dThe idea of the new manager was completely forgotten as he climbed the elevator. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s interest in other people was always at that level.\u201cHe seem like a sincere and good person.\u201dAs soon as he got out of the car, he cleaned the back seat. However, what Lee Wooyeon wanted was not a sincere and good manager. All he needed was a new manager every three months.\u201cDon\u2019t say anything you don\u2019t like. How is he? Is he okay? Do you think he will work for a long time?\u201d\u201cWell. Whether he works for a long time or not is a matter of his own will.\u201dLee Wooyeon sat down on the sofa, putting his fingers in the tie knot and untying it.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother me. There are limits to saving people.\u201dBecause it was a relatively good position, there were many applicants. But it was impossible for anyone to use it.\u201cYes. I wish he could stay longer this time.\u201dWithout changing the color of his face, Lee Wooyeon told a blatant lie. He morbidly hated having a man by his side all the time. Moreover, no matter how talented Lee Wooyeon is at hiding himself, sometimes his other personality will stand out. The limit of hiding it was 3 months on the dot. It was around that time when the first manager gave out a disgusting smell in front of him and chewed squid in the car, and he couldn\u2019t stand it and spit out abusive words, \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking pig.\u201d When the surprised manager stopped the car and asked what was going on, he said that he was recovering from reason and practicing the script, but Lee Wooyeon realized that his limits had been broken.After that, the manager was replaced within three months by any means.It didn\u2019t matter who the new manager was to Lee Wooyeon. It was enough to change it at the right time.\u201cHahaha. It will be long maybe.\u201dThe voice of CEO Kim, who was smiling over the phone, was unusual. Lee Wooyeon asked why, briefly.\u201cHe\u2019s your fan.\u201d\u201cOkay?\u201d\u201cHe said he was a complete fan. He has seen every single piece of your work.\u201dWhen working with celebrities, Lee Wooyeon, who had seen countless people say such things in order to get a good impression, ignored CEO Kim\u2019s words.\u201cGood for me.\u201d\u201cIt will fit you well. Don\u2019t nitpick for nothing, treat him well this time.\u201dIt sounds like fun to treat him well. Lee Wooyeon replied that he would do so and ended the call.When he came out of the living room after showering, Lee Wooyeon found that a text message had arrived. It was from the new manager.\u201cHello. This is Choi Inseop. I got the cell phone number from manager Cha. I will be waiting for you in the parking lot at 6 am the day after tomorrow. Have a good night.\u201dAt the last remark that a night server somewhere would send, Lee Wooyeon laughed. He turned on the audio and picked up the book he was reading yesterday. There was no one left in his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The constant sound of the doorbell continued.\u201cFuck.\u201dLee Wooyeon threw the pillow and got up from the bed. It was ten in the morning. Today was a day without a schedule, so he read a book until dawn and fell asleep. In short, it meant that no one has been given the right to wake him up at 10 am.He opened the front door without asking who it was.The man who was about to ring the doorbell stood still and looked at Lee Wooyeon.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s going on?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked in an annoyed voice. Choi Inseop stuttered and answered.\u201cOh, today\u2019s schedule has changed, so I got a call saying that the filming should be done today morning instead of the day after tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA faint annoyance appeared on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face. It was not uncommon for filming schedules to change. But at the very least, shouldn\u2019t they warn in advance?\u201cSorry.\u201dChoi Inseop bowed his head.\u201cNo. It\u2019s not Choi Inseop\u2019s fault. Fine.\u201dLee Wooyeon immediately put on the mask of a good person and responded. He said, \u201cCome in,\u201d and as he stepped out of the door, Choi Inseop flinched and looked around.\u201cAre you going to stay outside until I get ready?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes. Then.\u201dEven after entering the front door, Choi Inseop did not think about taking off his shoes. When Lee Wooyeon told him to come inside and wait a few more minutes, Choi Inseop took off his shoes.\u201cSit down and wait. Can I get you a drink?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine. I will just wait.\u201dChoi Inseop waved his hand and walked away, as if he hadn\u2019t heard anything. Lee Wooyeon thought Inseop wasn\u2019t the kind of person to work this type of job. In order to be a manager, sincerity was important, but shamelessness was an essential element.Taking water out of the refrigerator, Lee Wooyeon turned around and found Choi Inseop sitting on the sofa, with both hands on his knees, very nervous.How is he going to work with such a personality? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter. They won\u2019t see each other in two months anyway.Lee Wooyeon went into the bathroom to take a shower.Left alone, Choi Inseop saw that the bathroom door was closed and began to look around. The modern and neat interior that shows Lee Wooyeon\u2019s taste as it is, caught his attention. It was so clean and tidy that it was hard to believe that it was a house where a man lived alone.The only cluttered parts were the bedroom without sheets and books on the table. Choi Inseop quickly scanned the title of the book he was reading with his eyes. He had a good memory, so he was able to memorize all the titles of the book by reading it once. However, Choi Inseop took out his cell phone from his pocket to commemorate this moment. He even downloaded a program so that it would not make a sound even if he took a picture. He should record everything about Lee Wooyeon. He had to figure out as much as he could.He took a picture of the sofa first. He\u2019ll sit here and watch TV or listen to music. Then there was the CD. As if to prove that listening to music was a hobby, the cabinet was packed with CDs. While Choi Inseop was taking photos of the CD catalog, Lee Wooyeon came out of the bathroom after taking a shower.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon was wearing a bathrobe, but Choi Inseop did not dare raise his head. His heart was pounding like a boy caught doing something bad.\u201cIf you like something, borrow it.\u201dHaving said that, Lee Wooyeon went into his room. Choi Inseop\u2019s legs were shaking, so he went back to the sofa and sat down.It was still hard to believe that the two of them were alone in such a close space. Whenever he faced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s personal appearance one by one, Choi Inseop felt rewarded for the efforts that he had put in to stand here right now.Lee Wooyeon came out with his clothes on. Choi Inseop jumped up from his seat. Lee Wooyeon asked a question mixed with laughter as he ran to the front door and put on his shoes first.\u201cWhy are you in such a hurry? It\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dPutting on his shoes, Choi Inseop quickly opened the front door and waited. The same went for taking the elevator. First, he grabbed the elevator door and stayed far away from it.Lee Wooyeon disliked being close to people, like the managers. He quickly cut off the managers who were arrogant and sarcastic as if they could do anything.Even in the elevator, Choi Inseop was standing alone, staring at the wall without making eye contact. Lee Wooyeon felt that saying the new manager was his fan was something that was just said out of courtesy.When they arrived at the parking lot, Choi Inseop told him to wait and quickly brought the car. When he opened the car door and Lee Wooyeon entered, bread and coffee were laid out. If it was sweet coffee with whipped cream or milk, he had specifications, but it was an Americano. The bread was also white ciabatta from his favorite bakery.\u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t be able to eat breakfast, so I prepared it.\u201d\u201cThank you. Did Inseop have breakfast?\u201d\u201cYes. I did.\u201dChoi Inseop answered that as they were leaving, and turned the wheel. Lee Wooyeon hated the smell of other people\u2019s food in the car. Of course, he chose only the food he ate that did not have a strong smell.While eating the ciabatta, Lee Wooyeon remembered CEO Kim\u2019s words that the manager would never quit. It seems that this time, he really thought about it and chose him. Because of this small conscious, he felt a little sorry for CEO Kim, who would have put a lot of effort into choosing disposable items.As he drank the slightly cold coffee, he looked at Choi Inseop\u2019s back.\u201cI made a reservation at the shop, and with the help of Manager Cha, I picked out a few outfits.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLee Wooyeon said that to the back of the head of the new manager, who not only has a good sense but was also meticulous in his work. As soon as he spoke, Choi Inseop\u2019s ear went red, and Lee Wooyeon noticed.He recalled that the new manager was a big fan of his. Was it just a courtesy? Was it true? Suddenly curious, he asked a question.\u201cAre you serious about that?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dAt the red signal, the car stopped. Choi Inseop asked, making eye contact from the rearview mirror.\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said you were my fan.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I am a fan.\u201dSeeing the strength in the hand holding the handle, Lee Wooyeon smiled. It seemed to be true. He didn\u2019t like the female fans, but he hated the male fans even more.\u201cHow is it to see me in reality? It is said that there are many cases of disappointment when you see a celebrity in person.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that! Never, never been disappointed. Rather much more\u2026\u201dEven if one was to blaspheme God in front of a faithful Christian, they wouldn\u2019t jump like that. Choi Inseop turned his body completely back and opened his eyes and shouted.\u201cMuch more?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and waited for Choi Inseop to say the next thing.\u201cHow about much more?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. The best.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not just saying this out of courtesy. Really\u2026\u201dHorns blared from behind. Suddenly, the signal turned green. Choi Inseop turned his body forward and muttered in an awkward voice.\u201cIt really is. Really\u2026 You are the best.\u201dLee Wooyeon smirked from behind and waved his hand, saying, \u201cI understand.\u201d Choi In-seop kept his mouth shut as if he was concentrating on driving again. He didn\u2019t open his mouth until he got to the hairdresser.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A talkative manager was also number one in the kill list. In many ways, the new manager was someone he could be on good terms with.When they arrived at the hair salon, Choi Inseop dropped off Lee Wooyeon first. He left to park the car and said he would come later, and he disappeared.Upon entering the store, the manager recognized Lee Wooyeon and ran to him with a friendly face.\u201cAre you filming today?\u201d\u201cYes. All of a sudden, my schedule was pushed back. Take good care of me.\u201dHis polite way of speaking brightened the facial expressions of not only the hair dressers but also the staff. Among the many celebrities who came and went here, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manners were by far the best. It was common for people to become arrogant and have a stiff attitude when they became more popular than when they were rookies, but Lee Wooyeon was not like that.Lee Wooyeon was constantly praised for his gentle and polite attitude. Despite the rumors that his relationship with women were a bit complicated, the image about him was good enough to say that that part made him more human.\u201cIt looks like the manager is new.\u201dThe manager, who was touching his head, asked. When Lee Wooyeon answered yes with his eyes, the manager continued to talk.\u201cOddly enough, Mr. Wooyeon\u2019s managers change often. To be honest, if it\u2019s like that, doesn\u2019t that mean Woo-woon has a bad personality?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled looking at the mirror, and said yes. He heard the door open and Choi Inseop entered.\u201cNew manager?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHe looks good.\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s a good person.\u201dChoi Inseop quietly sat on the sofa in the corner of the store and started reading the book he brought. Seeing Choi Inseop bowing his head to the staff who brought the car, the hair dresser continued.\u201cWhat kind of person do you like, Mr. Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person do you like to work with?\u201dLee Wooyeon pretended to be thinking. Because he couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t like any.\u201cA manager like Helen Keller.\u201d\u201cWhat? Helen Keller?\u201dWhen the director asked, surprised, Lee Wooyeon laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a joke.\u201d When the hair and makeup was finished, Choi Inseop jumped up from his seat first.\u201cI will prepare tea.\u201dA few staff members burst into laughter as they watched his disappearing back before he could answer.\u201cDid he train in the military?\u201d\u201cEven a second-class is not like that. The new manager oppa is cute.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who had never associated the word cute with a man, stood up thinking, \u201cIs that so?\u201dWhen he went down the stairs, Inseop parked his car in front of the building and waited. While moving to the filming set, he did not open his mouth until Lee Wooyeon spoke to him.Looking at the manager moving quietly as if he was not there, Lee Wooyeon thought that this was the reason why CEO Kim was so proud. In terms of the person himself, Choi Inseop was a manager with a score of 100.However, the problem was Lee Wooyeon himself. No matter who the other person is, one day he will lose his temper. If they met at a reasonable distance, he could fake it forever, but it was difficult as they had to see each other everyday.The first to notice about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s personality was his family. So, it was only natural that he\u2019s isolated from his family and hasn\u2019t been in contact with them.\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dChoi Inseop, who had been silent for thirty minutes, finally opened his mouth and spoke. Fans who found out about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s filming were lined up around the parking lot. Lee Wooyeon was amazed. He found out this morning that the filming date had been changed, but what the hell is it about those women who are encamping over there and waiting? He doesn\u2019t know how the information leaked, but sometimes he got goosebumps.Choi Inseop, who got off the driver\u2019s seat, stood in front and secured a space for Lee Wooyeon to walk. As he got out of the car, screams that seemed to tear came from among the waiting women.Lee Wooyeon started walking with a kind face without losing his composure among the women who rushed to him as if they were in heat.\u201cOppa! Wooyeon oppa!\u201d\u201cAaaaah! Oppa!\u201d\u201cOppa, look here! I am Sumi. Sumi came.\u201dAs soon as the name of Sumi reached his ears, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes flashed with irritation. That was because the owner of that memorable voice and name was a crazy woman who left behind an unpleasant feeling every time.\u201cOppa! Do you remember me? I am Sumi! Do you remember Sumi?\u201dLee Wooyeon deliberately moved away from her without turning his head. Choi Inseop was in cold sweats as he stood in front of the influx of women. No matter how well he did his job, he was a beginner. When he was thrown naked among the extreme fans, he was stunned, not knowing what to do.\u201cPlease stay away for a bit. Sorry. Thank you.\u201dWhenever Lee Wooyeon moved, Choi Inseop asked for forgiveness. He had a soft voice, so even if he said that, his words were buried in the screams of the women and couldn\u2019t be heard, but he asked for forgiveness every time.Watching the rare sight of the manager gradually being buried among the women, Lee Wooyeon reached out and grabbed Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder. Because the manager clearly had a job to do on the set, he couldn\u2019t wait for this person forever.The moment he pulled the manager out, a woman who was screaming with a shrill voice ran towards Lee Wooyeon.\u201cOppa! Remember me! I\u2019m Jin Sumi! Sumi!\u201dHaving said that, she swung the paper cup she was holding towards Lee Wooyeon. A hot brown liquid was scattered in the air, which Choi Inseop blocked. He reflexively raised his hand to block it, but it was not enough to stop all the spilled coffee.\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cHey, what!\u201d\u201cShe must be crazy. Absolutely crazy, isn\u2019t it?\u201dCriticism poured out from among the women around him as well. Choi Inseop, who was suddenly baptized with coffee, just stood there blankly.A woman named Sumi, who threw the coffee, cried out to Lee Wooyeon to remember her.There are such people. People who behave rudely or act strangely and want to remain in the memory of their favorite celebrities.There were some people who did crazy things, after the joke that if you want to fall in love at first sight with a chaebol or celebrity, you should slap them on the face. Lee Wooyeon grabbed the wrist of several women who were about to swing their palm to slap him on the cheek.It felt really bad. He wanted to break her wrist, but he tried to suppress his anger and insisted that he would never want to do something like this again.But coffee. Trying to pour coffee into a person\u2019s face. Fuck, there\u2019s a degree to how crazy one can be.A crooked smile appeared on the corner of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips. The moment he reached out to grab the shoulder of the woman named Su-mi, Choi Inseop opened his mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201dThe person he spoke to was a woman holding a coffee cup.\u201cIt\u2019s not good to be remembered that way. It may be a temporary relief, but in the end it will only be painful.\u201dLee Wooyeon looked at the manager who was calming the crazy woman. He thought he was a person who couldn\u2019t speak properly, but he was quite good at dealing with women. Sumi, who was holding the cup, cried and blushed. Choi Inseop blinked at Lee Wooyeon to go in first.Lee Wooyeon turned his back with an expressionless face and walked into the filming set. Upon hearing the news, the cinematographer and staff flocked to him and asked if he was okay. Lee Wooyeon said that she was worried about the manager and returned a friendly reply that he was okay. Of course, it was not true that he was concerned about the manager. If the coffee baptism had not been stopped, Choi Inseop would have set the shortest record of two days until dismissal.Since it was a simple photo shoot, he was able to finish all the shoots in less than an hour. Choi Inseop did not appear until Lee Wooyeon finished filming and left the room to greet the director and staff.A few fans who had not yet left the filming set came up to Lee Wooyeon and handed him a paper to sign, but he didn\u2019t feel like it. In terms of temperament, he wanted to take that crazy bitch from a while ago and quietly take her in front of the lawyer, but no action was taken because of the manager. In fact, he knew that this episode was good for his own image, but he was upset because of her character.Lee Wooyeon, who was thinking horrible thoughts behind his gentle face, saw the manager trembling in front of the car.\u201c\u2026!\u201dWhen their eyes met, Choi Inseop\u2019s face became even more pale. In response to the incomprehensible reaction, Lee Wooyeon wondered if it was true that he was a fan.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dHe wanted to ask a question, but that was all he had to say. Wooyeon stood in front of the manager with a worried expression on his face.\u201cSorry. Because of me.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dChoi In-seop just did what was natural with his crawling voice, he added. Even after getting coffee for Lee Wooyeon, he looked as if he had sinned.\u201cWhy are you standing here instead of waiting in the car?\u201d\u201c\u2026 not dry yet, sorry.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s clothes were soaked in water, probably because he took off his top clothes and washed them. As soon as he saw the clothes still stained with coffee, he thought of the crazy woman who poured the coffee, and a faint anger flashed across Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face.\u201cSorry. I tried to remove it, but it didn\u2019t go well\u2026 sorry.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI know Lee Wooyeon doesn\u2019t like dirty clothes, but I\u2019m sorry. If you wish, I will call a taxi for you right away. Otherwise, I will ask the chief of staff Cha to come here now.\u201dChoi Inseop had coffee stains on his clothes. Lee Wooyeon wondered if CEO Kim had brought a believer from somewhere, not a manager.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIt was a cold winter. A cold wind blew that made teeth tremble just by wearing wet clothes.That winter, the man with the warmest face spoke with a voice sweet sweet enough that it could melt a cochlear implant.\u201cNever use \u2018nim\u2019 when calling me. You can call me Mr. Lee Wooyeon. I\u2019m older, so you can call me hyung.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd don\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry for that. I\u2019m more sorry. It was all my fault that Inseop became like this.\u201dChoi Inseop barely answered with a bewildered face.\u201cNo. I\u2026 of course I have to do it.\u201d\u201cA manager is someone who helps, not a servant.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager resigned for the ninth time, CEO Kim called Lee Wooyeon with his face red, shouted and asked what kind of manager he wanted. Lee Wooyeon responded with a bright smile like a flower at that time.Blind, deaf and dumb slave, of course, although he must be able to hear and speak and show. At that time, CEO Kim\u2019s expression was interesting, so Lee Wooyeon giggled for a while, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s a joke,\u201d and passed it on.\u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s cold.\u201d\u201cYes. All right.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, Choi Inseop took a deep breath. Lee Wooyeon looked at the back of the new manager, who moved according to his words, as if it were interesting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After hearing Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words to take a shower and change clothes at his house, Choi Inseop turned white on the spot. Seeing that he did not refuse even though he was bewildered and embarrassed by not knowing where to put himself, Lee Wooyeon thought that the manager must be his big fan.After showering first in the shower room attached to the bedroom, Lee Wooyeon poured coffee and waited for Choi Inseop to come out. It was not his personality to give his bathroom to the manager, but it was a decision he made because returning the manager who had been baptized with coffee was not the way of the beloved actor Lee Woo-yeon.As he drank freshly brewed coffee and thought that the new manager had a long shower time for a man, he heard the doorbell.When he checked the screen of the intercom, it was Yoo Minju, whom he had met several times before and had a drink with. When he found out that she lived in the same complex, Lee Wooyeon regretted having slept with her. As he expected, Yoo Minjoo would come out of the blue several times afterwards to talk about unpleasant things and eat or sleep..Although most of them were consistently ignored, Lee Wooyeon wanted to talk clearly today. Since they both have celebrity status, he was going to gently say that they should refrain.The moment he opened the front door, Lee Wooyeon realized that he had taken the wrong timing to say that.\u201cWhat? Were you at home?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEvery time Yoo Minju, who was drunk, spoke, a terrible smell came out. When Lee Wooyeon said, \u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d she asked, rolling her eyes.\u201cYes. I am drunk, what more do you want to add?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very drunk.\u201d\u201cHmph. But you\u2019re still at home today and not pretending like you\u2019re not there, Mr. Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLast time I saw, the house was definitely lit. Why didn\u2019t you answer when I rang the bell?\u201d\u201cI guess I couldn\u2019t hear because I was listening to music. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThere was no lie in saying that he couldn\u2019t hear because he was listening to music. The moment Yoo Minju started to ring the doorbell, Lee Wooyeon put on headphones and turned up the audio volume.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with me coming? Can\u2019t I come over?\u201dHaving said that, she looked up and saw the wine bottle he was holding.\u201cLet\u2019s have a drink together.\u201d\u201cI have a schedule tomorrow morning, so we can\u2019t drink.\u201d\u201cWho doesn\u2019t have a schedule for tomorrow?\u201dIt was reckless. Although the owner of the house expressed his refusal, she entered the house recklessly. Because he ignored her several times, her self-esteem was seriously damaged, and she seemed to have made up her mind today. She rummaged through the chest of drawers as if it was her own kitchen and found a wine opener. Yoo Minju, who took the cork off without stoppig, started looking for wine glasses this time.\u201cMiss Minju, please return today. Next time\u2026\u201d\u201cNext time? You ignored all my calls! Is it because you have a different girlfriend besides me\u2026\u201dMinju, who was talking, stopped and looked towards the bathroom. Her expression hardened at the sound of water coming from the bathroom.\u201cIt\u2019s the manager.\u201d Lee Wooyeon said.\u201cManager? Ha,\u201dShe shouted as she drank the whole bottle of wine she was carrying.\u201cDo not be ridiculous. Do you think I would believe that?\u201dLee Wooyeon quietly closed the door. It\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t know what to say to a woman who\u2019s out of her mind and even drinks.\u201cWho is it? Let me see her face.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the manager.\u201d\u201cReally, it\u2019s not even funny. Kang Sohyun? Is it her? Aren\u2019t there rumors that you are eating with her these days? Or is it Lee Junghwa?\u201d\u201cYou seem to be very drunk, so please stop and go back today.\u201dAnd the moment he was about to tell her to never come again, she started running towards the bathroom.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see what kind of girl she is. Who is the woman who takes a bath naked in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s bathroom\u2026!\u201dShe opened the bathroom door and pushed it back. Choi Inseop, who was standing under the shower, turned around in surprise. Lee Wooyeon pulled Yoo Minju back. Choi Inseop\u2019s body caught the eyes of Lee Wooyeon, who raised his head to say sorry before closing the door. He closed the bathroom door without saying a word.Yoo Minju, who confirmed with her own eyes that the person inside was a man, continued with a muttering.\u201cOh, he was a real manager. I again\u2026, well, I\u2019m sorry. Tell the manager later. Of course, this time, of course, you will make it a no-brainer, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and grabbed her wrist and led her to the front door. He spoke politely, but his demeanor was not.\u201cIt has to be something that never happened. of course.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then again later\u2026\u201dOpening the front door, Lee Wooyeon pushed her. Because of Lee Wooyeon, who still had a friendly smile, Yoo Minju did not even realize that she was being kicked out without even wearing shoes.\u201cIt never happened. Miss Minju.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, I\u2026 \u201dLee Wooyeon added a word as he kicked her shoes that were near his feet.\u201cSo, goodbye.\u201dAfter the door closed, a nervous woman\u2019s voice was heard outside, but Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t care. After a while, Choi Inseop came out after taking a shower. His face was red from embarrassment because of the sudden event.\u201cSorry. She was drunk and I stopped her, but she didn\u2019t listen.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine\u2026Did she go?\u201dChoi Inseop looked around the house and asked. He had just come out of the shower, so his face was red and it looked like he was about to cry if he tapped it.\u201cYes. I just sent her.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dSurprisingly, Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulders were filled with water that had not been wiped off. Lee Wooyeon brought a towel and held it out.\u201cWipe it.\u201d\u201cAh. Sorry.\u201dChoi Inseop, holding the towel, fell on the floor and started wiping off the water. Lee Wooyeon could not continue to speak looking at the absurdity.\u201c\u2026No, I was telling you to dry your hair.\u201d\u201cAh, this, this.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s face turned red even more. He got up and wiped his head with the towel he had been mopping the floor with.At this point, Lee Wooyeon thought that it would be difficult to tell whether a person is a fool or a good person. He took out another new towel and handed it to Choi Inseop. There was no conversation between the two of them.Lee Woo-yeon was not in a good mood because of Yoo Minju\u2019s intrusion, so he was not in the mood to pretend to be kind and considerate, and Choi Inseop was embarrassed and didn\u2019t know what to say. Choi In-eop, who thoroughly wiped the moisture from his hair while standing, spoke first.\u201cI will go first.\u201d\u201cYes. Today, somehow I feel like I\u2019m just causing trouble.\u201d\u201cNo. Never mind.\u201d\u201cForget what happened today.\u201dChoi Inseop wasn\u2019t so tactless that he didn\u2019t know exactly what he was saying.\u201cYes. I will.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even tell Mr. Kim. He must have a lot of work, so I don\u2019t want to worry him for nothing.\u201dIf CEO Kim knew about this, it was clear that he would run with foam in his mouth. How the hell do you deal with women\u2019s issues so that something like that doesn\u2019t happen?Just imagining it was terrifying. Lee Wooyeon was a representative actor of JN. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a moderate scandal, but it wasn\u2019t for him, no matter how selfish a person he was, to decorate the front page of a daily newspaper with something like this.\u201cYes. All right.\u201dLike a gentle dog that listens well, Choi Inseop nodded and answered. Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t like people with a light mouth either.\u201c\u2026 pack it up fast and leave.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNo. May I call you a taxi?\u201dIt may have sounded like friendly consideration, but it was a clear message. Choi Inseop waved his hand saying it was okay, packed his belongings and went outside.\u201cYou\u2019re too quick.\u201dThe more he thought about it, the more he could not help but be a customized manager for himself.It was almost impossible to find someone who was quiet, devoted, quick-witted, and had a tight lip and was sincere. Yes, it would be three months, but he thought he could handle it well in the meantime.\u201cWhere did they bring that from?\u201dEven the timely arrival right after manager Kim left was perfect. In Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mind, while thinking such a thought, the body of Choi In-seop he saw when Yoo Minjoo opened the bathroom door came to mind. The bathroom was filled with water vapor, so the drunken Yoo Minju seemed to have only seen the fact that the nude person was a man. However, the scar left on Choi Inseop\u2019s chest was clearly visible in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes, which boasts a nearly 2.0 visual. Even after seeing it, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t ask anything. What kind of past the gentle-faced manager had was not important right now.Lee Wooyeon looked at the label of the wine that Yoo Minju was carrying and spilled the wine into the sink without hesitation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat.\u00a0What kind of wind came to the office?\u201dSeeing Lee Wooyeon sitting on the sofa, CEO Kim Hakseung frowned as if he saw something he couldn\u2019t believe.\u201cI came here to say hello after a long time.\u201d\u201cWhat else are you looking at?\u201d\u201cManager\u2019s resume.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Who is it?\u201d\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201cWhy him?\u00a0What is wrong with him?\u00a0What are you going to do?!\u00a0You!\u201d\u201cWhat am I doing?\u00a0If other people hear that, they will misunderstand,\u00a0CEO.\u201dThese words were not false.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t do anything.\u00a0The new manager was surprisingly quick to adapt.\u00a0As if to prove that he was a fan, he didn\u2019t do anything that Wooyeon hated or offended him.\u00a0He prepares his favorite food every morning and often listens to music on the way home from work.\u00a0He usually drinks black, but he also knew that he liked lattes when it rained.His eye for choosing clothes was good enough to\u00a0 get admiration from the coordinator.\u00a0He picked out clothes that would suit Lee Wooyeon perfectly.\u00a0In addition, when Lee Wooyeon was not in a good mood, he had a sense of quickly stepping back.It was perfect.\u00a0It was so perfect that it didn\u2019t feel good.\u201cWhy are you looking at Inseop\u2019s resume?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s someone I work with, so it\u2019s natural to have questions.\u201d\u201cOf course you would say that.\u00a0Have you ever seen a manager\u2019s resume at least once in the past?\u201d\u201cSo, can\u2019t I take a look?\u201dLee Wooyeon turned over Choi Inseop\u2019s self-introduction letter without raising his head and asked.\u00a0He often revealed his personality in the past in front of CEO Kim since he was found out about his trashy personality\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it, but\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay then.\u201dLee Wooyeon meticulously scanned Choi Inseop\u2019s resume.\u201cWhy?\u00a0What is the problem?\u201d\u201cIt does not matter.\u201d\u201cHowever?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s not much, so that\u2019s the problem.\u201d\u201cIf there is a problem, they leave, even if they don\u2019t, you have a problem.\u00a0What the hell are you?\u00a0Aigoo.\u201dCEO Kim Hakseung made a sound of sickness and sat on the sofa opposite Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Even today, Lee Wooyeon smiled brightly as he looked at his attire with a t-shirt showing his charm from head to toe.\u201cCEO, you should\u2019ve been a celebrity.\u201d\u201cMe?\u00a0I did it before.\u00a0Modelling.\u201d\u201cReally?I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0okay.\u00a0what would you know?\u00a0You have no interest in others.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u00a0I am also very interested in other people.\u201d\u201cRight.\u00a0You\u2019re a good actor.\u00a0You\u2019re lying through your teeth.\u201dWhile listening to Kim Hakseung\u2019s speech, Lee Wooyeon read Choi In-seop\u2019s resume again.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Choi Inseop was selected by me myself, but there was nothing special.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0According to the resume, that\u2019s true.\u201dChoi Inseop on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 looked ordinary enough to set the standard for men in Korea.\u00a0The second son among two sons and one daughter.\u00a0Born in Seoul, graduated from a four-year program in Seoul.\u00a0TOEIC was 800 and went to the U.S. for language training for a while.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a waste to be a manager?\u201d\u201cBecause getting a job these days is like picking stars in the sky.\u00a0There are people who learn to work here and then start a management company.\u201d\u201cIs Choi Inseop that type of person?\u201dHe could not have imagined that meek and quiet man running a business.\u201cNo.\u00a0He\u2019s not that type, um\u2026 that\u2019s a bit odd.\u00a0It\u2019s not bad though.\u00a0How\u2019s work?\u00a0Are you doing well?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Treat him well.\u00a0Because he seems like a good guy.\u00a0And while you\u2019re here, look at the script that came in and go.\u201d\u201cA script?\u00a0Wasn\u2019t that what the representative chose?\u201dSince CEO Kim Hakseung\u2019s eye for selecting works was different, it had been a long time since Lee Wooyeon handed over the decision-making authority to him.\u201cThere are a lot of good things.\u00a0What do you think would be good?\u201d\u201cThe villain.\u201dLee Wooyeon replied with a smile.\u00a0CEO Kim refused.\u201cNo.\u00a0If you do that, your temper will come out and it\u2019s so scary.\u00a0I\u2019m sure a few quick-witted people will notice your filthy temper.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who has a soft image, wanted to play a vicious villain.\u00a0Each time, CEO Kim Hakseung firmly shook his head.It was so real, he argued, that his true form would come out at times.\u201cIf you only play a role that is too good, your image gets boring.\u00a0How about this?\u00a0Serial killer.\u00a0I think it will be fun.\u201dLee Wooyeon said while picking up the script that CEO Kim had rejected and cast aside.\u201c\u2026Because it suits you so much.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u00a0Representative.\u00a0Who am I going to kill?\u00a0Isn\u2019t this ok, too?\u00a0A psycho who falls madly in love with the female lead.\u00a0Killer.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be a murderer.\u00a0After you do that, only killer roles will keep coming in.\u00a0All ads will be gone.\u201d\u201cWhat if I made enough money, but the ads ran out?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u00a0Don\u2019t say nonsense, pick one of these.\u201dCEO Kim Hakseung pushed the script he had chosen to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was scanning the cover of the script, picked up one of them.\u201cThis will be good.\u00a0The producer and the writer are fine.\u00a0It\u2019s a period drama, so I think the reaction will be good.\u201d\u201cRight.\u00a0It seemed fine to me too.\u00a0I heard that this writer wants to work with you and send the script first.\u201d\u201cDo you believe in those kinds of words?\u00a0Unlike Manager Kim, you are naive.\u201dEven if the script went back to another actor and was rejected, the writer would always say that he was thinking of you and writing it out.\u201cHey. Who do you think the rumor wouldn\u2019t be heard? It\u2019s true. You always doubt what people say.\u201d\u201cPlease.\u00a0I don\u2019t mind.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and turned over the script.\u00a0Every time he smiled,revealing his teeth, CEO Kim felt goosebumps.\u00a0Unknown women praised Lee Wooyeon\u2019s neat teeth for being beautiful, but CEO Kim couldn\u2019t.\u201cI\u2019ll do this.\u00a0The script is also good.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0I get it.\u00a0I will contact you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLee Wooyeon got up from his seat.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s resume was still in his hand.\u201cWhy are you taking it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just going to see.\u201d\u201c\u2026do not do that.\u00a0You\u2019re awful.\u00a0If you want to fire him, just fire him\u2026 no, please don\u2019t.\u00a0Please.\u00a0I\u2019m tired of looking at resumes now.\u201d\u201cBut I never fired anyone.\u201dWith those words, Lee Wooyeon finally said goodbye and left.\u00a0The manager, who was quietly organizing papers alone in the corner, opened his mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0He never fired anyone.\u00a0You know everything.\u201d\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know? Anyway, Cha, monitor Lee Wooyeon aswell so that he can\u2019t play tricks this time. Help Choi Inseop out, okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I\u2019ll do that.\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard because Choi endures what Lee Wooyeon wants as a manager, even if he dies!\u201dCEO Kim Hak-seung shouted.\u00a0Manager Cha, who was organizing the documents, turned his head.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0You want me to go through that hell again?\u00a0Do you hear that sound, when you see blood spitting out of my mouth?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe next day after learning about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s dirty personality, CEO Kim Hakseung called the manager and said that he should take the role of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u00a0The manager Cha nodded obediently to that as well.\u00a0It was because he thought that big things would happen if his true nature was revealed.\u00a0However, within a month, it was the manager who had a big problem.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who did not need to show pretense in front of the manager, showed off his personality as it is, and eventually the manager vomited blood from his mouth and collapsed.From that day on, Chief Cha declared that he would never take on Lee Woyeon\u2019s managerial job.\u201cIf I take the role of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager again, I won\u2019t be human.\u00a0Anyway, if you do that, it will be the day when I will be prepared to leave the floor and call in sports newspaper reporters and hold a press conference, so please take care.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t.\u201dCEO Kim looked in the mirror, trimmed his messy hair, and muttered to himself.\u201cSheesh.\u00a0Is there no human in the world who can accept all of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s qualities?\u00a0Damn it.\u201dThe manager shouted as he put down the documents he was holding on the desk aloud.\u201cIf there\u2019s such a crazy punk like that in the world, I\u2019ll call him \u2018hyung\u2019 and follow him forever! You have to wish for it, a person. What\u2019s wrong with him? Really.\u201d\u201cAs long as they don\u2019t exist, why are you screaming?\u201dWhen CEO Kim responded, Manager Cha exclaimed and went out of the meeting room.\u00a0CEO Kim took a bitter taste and organized the script Lee Wooyeon left behind.\u00a0Suddenly, a good and capable new manager, Choi Inseop, came to his mind.\u201cIt would be nice, but \u2026It can\u2019t be.\u201dHe shook his head, pushing the thought that had just occurred to him in his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

8Translated by NaralaraEdited by Naralara\u201cThis is what we will be interviewing today.\u00a0The answers were written briefly based on what I had interviewed before.\u201dFrom early morning until late at night, he worked by his side, wondering when to prepare something like this.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s time was not 24 hours, but 36 hours.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t you need it?\u201dChoi Inseop asked, blinking his big eyes.\u201cNo.\u00a0thank you.\u201dLee Wooyeon accepted the file and looked through the questionnaire and expected answers with his eyes.\u00a0Usually, before an interview, reporters would send in a question for the day.\u00a0Today\u2019s interview was with a reporter notorious for asking embarrassing questions to actors.\u00a0That\u2019s why the agency deliberately requested to ask him a predictable question.\u201cI think it will take about 40 minutes or so.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who saw the questionnaire, muttered as he estimated the expected time.\u00a0Today, after this schedule, he was going to go home and rest.\u201cI\u2019m going to finish early today.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I see.\u201d\u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re done?\u00a0Date?\u201d\u201cOh, I don\u2019t. not\u00a0like that.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Don\u2019t you have a girlfriend?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201dHe could see the strength in the hand holding the steering wheel.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon leaned back on the seat and continued talking.\u201cThen what do you do on your day off?\u201d\u201cAt home\u2026 rest.\u201dWhen an uninteresting answer came back, Lee Wooyeon stopped his curiosity towards the manager and closed his eyes.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who was grunting about whether he should add another answer, noticed that the other person had completely closed his eyes and let out a small sigh.Choi Inseop, who stopped the car in front of the cafe in Cheongdam-dong, the meeting place, turned his head and asked.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u00a0Where should I wait?\u201d\u201cCome inside and let\u2019s have a cup of tea together.\u201d\u201cYes?\u00a0I\u2019ll just\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop was smiling and waving his hand at the suggestion.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was joking, and got out of the car.Choi Inseop pressed his opposite hand with the palm of his hand.\u00a0It was a habit these days.\u00a0Calm down.\u201cUra-cha-cha.\u201dChoi Inseop slapped his cheeks with his warm palms and gave himself a boost.\u00a0It reminded him of a Korean proverb \u2018even if you are bitten by a tiger, you can live if you are conscious\u2019.\u00a0He found a parking lot, parked the car, and went out.\u00a0After confirming that the reporter and Lee Wooyeon were sitting opposite each other in the all-glass cafe, Choi Inseop took a seat on the terrace.\u00a0The clerk came out and suggested that he have a seat inside, but he replied that he would be outside.\u00a0It was still cold, so the friendly clerk brought a lap blanket along with the coffee he ordered to the bizarre customer sitting on the terrace.Choi Inseop placed a blanket on his lap and wrapped his hands on the warm mug to warm his cold fingers.According to the information he has gathered so far, Lee Wooyeon hated having a manager chasing after him.\u00a0It was important to keep a reasonable distance.\u00a0Originally, he wanted to stick close to him and take one picture per second, but now he couldn\u2019t.\u00a0There wasn\u2019t much time left.\u00a0Choi Inseop already knew that the maximum time he could be with Lee Wooyeon as a manager was three months.\u201cLet\u2019s hold on.\u00a0Since it has been ten days and today, one day has already passed\u2026Whoa.\u201dChoi Inseop sighed as he counted the time he had left with his fingers.He habitually turned his gaze to Lee Wooyeon.The side view of Lee Wooyeon, who was having a conversation with a reporter near the window, was as beautiful as a painting.\u00a0The scene where Lee Wooyeon, with a neat and beautiful face, held a coffee cup in his hand looked like a masterpiece painted by a master who gave his soul to the devil.\u201c\u2026uh?\u201dChoi Inseop, who was spying on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s profile, stood up without hesitation.***\u201cThere were rumors like that, what do you think?\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u00a0Are there any rumors like that?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled softly, but he was swearing inside.\u00a0Reporter Kim Haeshin, who was notorious for her tenacity, had been throwing the same question with a slurred smile since before.\u201cYes.\u00a0From what I know, last year alone, the manager changed five times, and this year too, the change was not easy.\u00a0Is there any special reason?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ve said it before, but there were personal reasons for quitting, so they resigned themselves.\u00a0Do you have any other questions?\u201dThe purpose of this interview was to ask questions related to the movie to be released next month.\u00a0But as soon as he sat down, this woman was like a mad dog, persistently pouring out only questions about the manager.\u201cDon\u2019t you think resignation is too frequent for personal reasons? It\u2019s widely believed that managers don\u2019t change for celebrities who have a good image like Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cAm I the first exception?\u00a0Then.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and picked up a cup of coffee.Such a jerk.\u00a0The slyness was clearly visible.\u00a0No matter what he answered, it was clear that this interview would be inflated with a provocative headline.Lee Wooyeon wondered how long he had to sit and be interviewed.\u201cWell.\u00a0As a journalist, I have realized that there is no way smoke will come out of an open chimney.\u00a0What do you think?\u00a0Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cI have no idea.\u201dHe put down his coffee cup.\u00a0Gradually,heI felt the limit.\u00a0He looked at his watch and saw that he had been seated for less than ten minutes.At times like this, if someone dies, it would be nice to use it as an excuse.Lee Woo-yeon smiled with a terrible thought in his head.\u201cWhat do you think about the rumors that Lee Wooyeon usually bullied managers and made them quit?\u00a0Do you think that your kind image is a calculated action made with a thorough plan?\u201dIt was one of the most common types of malicious comments on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s articles.\u00a0Although he was an actor famous for having no antis, he did not always have only good comments.\u00a0Even among the occasional malicious comments, whenever someone saw that all of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s actions were pretentious, they showed them and laughed. As if they were having a lot of fun.\u201cHow can a human being be perfect?You\u2019re a human too, so there must be some downsides.\u201dWhen he returned the stereotypical, obvious answer, reporter Kim Haeshin showed him her notebook with a smile.\u201cLook here.\u00a0This is the time when Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager came in and left, right?\u00a0Do you have any thoughts on seeing this?\u201dLooking at the dates written on it, Lee Wooyeon smiled brightly.This person is a real motherfucker\u2026Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes, which had been pouring swear words at the reporter, shone.\u00a0He called out the new manager\u2019s name in an exhilarating voice.\u201cInseop!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dChoi Inseop, who was standing behind a large flower pot, opened his eyes in surprise like a cat on fire.\u201cInseop.\u00a0You said you worked nearby, did you come for coffee?\u201dLee Wooyeon also treated the manager with respect.\u00a0However, there was a difference between being polite and being informal.\u00a0He was the type of person who never had any private meeting with the manager or had any personal contact with him.\u00a0Of course, even though he told them to be comfortable, he\u00a0 never went out with them.Choi Inseop could not help but be astonished at the scene where Lee Wooyeon called him by name only a few days after meeting him.\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a drink.\u201d\u201cyes\u2026\u00a0uh,\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon said to the reporter, \u201cWait a minute,\u201d and got up from his seat.\u00a0He patted Choi Inseop on the shoulder and asked what he would like to drink.\u201c\u2026what to drink\u00a0What would be good?\u201dA cold sweat ran down the back of Choi Inseop, who pretended to look at the menu and muttered.\u00a0After discovering that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s atmosphere was unusual, he entered the store just in case, and got caught up in an absurd situation.\u201cChoose anything.\u00a0as you like.\u201dChoi Inseop accurately noticed the meaning hidden in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words.\u00a0It was a threat masquerading as kindness.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry, just choose anything.\u201cAmericano.\u00a0hot.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop placed an order, Lee Wooyeon took out a card from his wallet and handed it to the clerk.\u00a0The clerk glanced at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face and took the card.\u201cPlease sign on the card reader.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and picked up the pen.\u00a0At that moment, Choi Inseop saw Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingertips pointing to the terminal.\u00a0Instead of writing his signature on the reader, he wrote a short phrase.After hesitating for a moment, the clerk offered Lee Wooyeon a paper and a pen.\u00a0In a natural manner, this time he drew an autograph with his name clearly on it.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Drink and go.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh.\u201dIf he doesn\u2019t answer in a semi-verbal way, it seems like something big will happen, so Choi Inseop responded to him as much as possible.Lee Wooyeon went back to his seat and sat down.\u00a0Choi Inseop took the coffee handed to him by the clerk and went outside.\u201cWho was that?\u201d\u201cSomeone I know.\u00a0I heard that he worked nearby, but we met by chance.\u00a0Sorry.\u00a0Where were we?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the manager.\u201d\u201cAh.\u00a0Yes.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u201dReporter Kim Haeshin swallowed her saliva and waited for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s next words.\u00a0Then, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cell phone, which was placed on the table, rang.\u201cWait.\u00a0Sorry.\u201dThe name on the phone was Manager.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked for forgiveness and answered the phone call.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t long before Lee Wooyeon\u2019s expression hardened.\u201csorry.\u201dHe got up from his seat and politely bowed his head and apologized to the reporter.\u201cSomething bad has happened and I think I need to go back to the office right now.\u00a0Sorry.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cAn acquaintance contacted me saying that his father passed away. I\u2019ve met his father several times because he was like my older brother\u2026\u201dThe corners of his eyes, which had blurred the end of his words, were wet with sadness.\u00a0Reporter Kim Haeshin, who saw it, had to say without realizing it, go quickly.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon picked up his clothes.\u201cThen I will see you next time.\u00a0Please make an appointment through the office.\u201d\u201cYes, then\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do the calculations.\u00a0I apologize again.\u201dLee Wooyeon politely greeted and left the store.\u00a0Looking back, the reporter had to admit his defeat.\u00a0She could feel that the broken board could not be set up again, with the feeling of an old reporter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was really in trouble.\u201dChoi Inseop went inside to observe the difficulties directly from the side, but never tried to save him.\u00a0However, after paying the card and seeing Lee Wooyeon\u2019s letters on the reader, he had no choice but to follow his instructions.Call me.Choi Inseop went out of the store and called as soon as he turned the corner.\u00a0As he expected, after a while, Lee Wooyeon walked out of the store.\u201cBut how did you know?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThat I was in bad shape.\u00a0You were outside.\u00a0On the terrace seats.\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop was dizzy.\u00a0How on earth can he say that he had watched his movies and everything over and over again to find out about him, and that he can recognize his expressions because of the stalker skills he had accumulated over the years?\u201cJust\u2026The coffee was bitter and I came in to get syrup\u2026\u201d\u201cBy chance?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0by chance.\u201dChoi Inseop raised his head as if he had found a rope to save him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked at him and gave him a friendly look.\u201cIt\u2019s a lucky coincidence.\u201dHis voice was so sweet , it sounded as gentle as an angel who put a child on his lap and gave him candy.\u00a0Choi Inseop quickly turned his head.Lee Wooyeon looked at the manager acting like an adolescent boy with interest.\u201cThen shall I drive you home?\u201dChoi Inseop started the engine and asked.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who had been pensive for a moment, tapped his shoulder and asked.\u201cWhat are you doing this evening?\u201dAs soon as Lee Wooyeon entered the store, people\u2019s eyes were all on him.\u00a0He naturally walked to a seat deep inside, guided by the waiter.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who suddenly had a meal with him,\u00a0 fell into contemplation and quietly followed him.After choosing a menu recommended by Lee Wooyeon, Choi Inseop sat quietly, fiddling with a glass of water.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHow is your job as a manager?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fine.\u201dAlthough the tone was soft, Choi Inseop was nervous and waited for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s next words.\u201cAre there any difficult parts?\u201d\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\u201cDo you like sports?\u00a0When I looked at your resume, it said that one of your hobbies was soccer.\u201d\u201cYeah, just a little\u2026\u00a0\u201dSoccer was a hobby he wrote down on purpose to look ordinary.\u00a0He broke out in a cold sweat.\u00a0Why was he doing this?\u00a0Why?\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was not interested in other people, did not understand why he was paying attention to his resume, and even to such a trivial hobby.\u201cWhat motivated you to apply for a manager job?\u201d\u201cYes?!?\u201dChoi Inseop felt like he was gradually falling into a labyrinth.\u00a0It was because he could not figure out why Lee Wooyeon suddenly brought him to a high-end restaurant and interrogated him.\u00a0While working next to Lee Wooyeon, he simulated tens of thousands of situations in his head, but he never dared to imagine such a thing.\u201cBecause you are my fan?\u00a0So, did you change your career path this way?\u201dChoi Inseop was very hesitant at the tone that seemed to question him somehow.\u2018Let\u2019s be calm\u00a0You have to be calm.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t know anything yet.\u2019\u201cI was originally interested in this work.\u00a0An acquaintance recommended JN Entertainment, so I submitted my resume.\u201dHe slowly told him the motivation to enter the company, which he could memorize by tapping even with his eyes closed.\u201cAre you going to stay on this side?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes, if possible.\u201dHe already knew that Lee Wooyeon changed his manager from time to time.\u00a0It was information that could be found easily with a little research.\u00a0The period of observing him next to him as a manager was up to three months.\u00a0Inseop was quietly going to leave Korea after that.He had to be careful and quietly stay next to him so that Lee Wooyeon could not remember whether Choi Inseop existed or not.He thought he would flow like water, seep in like water, and disappear.\u201cYou seem like a good fit for me.\u201dLee Wooyeon continued talking while drinking the wine that the waiter poured.\u201cYou adapt well to work, are quick-witted, and are sincere\u2026\u00a0You\u2019ve got everything one needs to like it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe representative.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop sighed.\u00a0He thought his heart would sink when he thought that Lee Wooyeon was saying that he liked him as a manager.He had to keep the middle ground.\u00a0Be with him for as long as possible, but he has to walk a tightrope as a manager without making any memorable impression.\u00a0He made up his mind and lifted his head.\u00a0However, he did not make eye contact with Lee Wooyeon.\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026Twenty-six.\u201d\u201cYou look much younger.\u201d\u201cI hear that a lot.\u201dChoi Inseop was uncomfortable with this kind of setting.\u00a0It was the most unwanted of all the simulations he had turned in his head countless times, to have random, personal personal affairs or private conversations.In fact, Choi Inseop was 24 years old.\u00a0The 26-year-old Choi Inseop was the one he had paid for.\u00a0Even though he knew that Lee Wooyeon had said these words without much thought, he felt like his heart would burst.\u00a0He drank cold water and calmed his heart.Lee Wooyeon, who had been thinking for a moment, tried to open his mouth, but a waiter came into the room with food.\u00a0Without a doubt, the food looked expensive..\u00a0Choi Inseop picked up a fork, thinking about why Lee Wooyeon would buy such expensive food for him, the manager.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWithout realizing it, he raised his head and met his eyes.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was smiling.\u00a0It was the same face he had seen countless times on the screen and in photos.\u201cI mean.\u201dChoi Inseop stared blankly as Lee Wooyeon was elegantly slicing a steak with a knife in one hand.\u00a0His actions had a charm that drew attention.\u00a0Drinking water, making gestures, and holding a knife, such detailed actions were beautiful enough to make the other person stop breathing for a moment and look at them.\u201cActually, someone told me\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon, who had spoken up to that point, said, muttering.\u201cWhat is the problem\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0Please wait.\u201dLee Wooyeon called the waiter.\u00a0To the waiter who asked what the problem was, he asked what the name of the chef who made this dish was.\u00a0When the waiter, who had been nervous for a while, bowed and answered something, Lee Wooyeon\u00a0 stood up.\u201cWait, excuse me.\u201dHe went out.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who was left alone, hesitated for a moment and got up.\u00a0When he opened the door and looked outside, he saw no one in the hallway.\u00a0He quickly went to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s seat and started looking at the cell phone he had left behind.\u00a0Unfortunately, the phone was locked.\u00a0He recalled Lee Wooyeon pressing the password on the front door and quickly put in the four digit number.After some trial and error, the lock setting was released.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s hands trembled.\u00a0Last time he picked up Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cell phone in the car, he couldn\u2019t remember anything about the password, so he decided to give it back to him.First, let\u2019s look at the call list.\u201c\u2026Sheesh.\u201dLooking at the call list, Choi Inseop clicked his tongue low.\u00a0Lee Wo-yeon\u2019s phone was completely erased, leaving only a list of calls made to him, CEO Kim, manager Cha, and other business calls.\u00a0So was the phone book.\u00a0Only the phone number of the person related to work was left, and the name of the same woman could not be found.He looked through the list of photos just in case.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dWhen he looked through the phone, he couldn\u2019t find anything except a few pictures of the flowers that were basically inside.\u201cNo selfies.\u00a0Well, since\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop grumbled and looked around, but couldn\u2019t find any information.\u00a0He put the phone back in place.\u00a0He returned to his seat and sat down, but Lee Wooyeon did not return.\u201cWhat.\u00a0where all of a sudden\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop remembered the moment when he suddenly called the waiter and dipped the steak on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s plate with his finger and tasted it.\u201cUgh, heck.\u201dIt was as if the steak was marinated in salt and grilled, he drank water, thinking that it would wash down the saltiness.\u00a0He rubbed his tongue with his cuff, but still felt a tingling sensation from the intense salty taste.\u00a0Lee Wo-yeon, who quietly went out to find the chef without grimacing even after eating this, was to the point of respect.\u201c\u2026fight.\u201dChoi Inseop quietly went outside with his cell phone in hand.\u00a0It may be a golden opportunity to get an important scene.He came out of the hallway and moved cautiously to find Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Seeing the waiter who was serving earlier, he asked in a low voice where Lee Wooyeon had gone.The waiter pointed his hand at the door next to the kitchen and disappeared.\u00a0It was an emergency exit.His heart was pounding.\u00a0Choi Inseop pressed the area near his heart with his palm.\u201cSlowly.\u00a0Slowly.\u201dEvery time his heart beat faster, he always mumbled the same thing.\u00a0Then he felt as if the blood in his body was slowly moving according to their own will.\u00a0He carefully grabbed the doorknob and opened the door.At first he could find no one, so he left with disappointment and tried to close the door.\u00a0It was at that moment that the voice of a whispering little woman was heard.\u201c\u2026!\u201dChoi Inseop grabbed the doorknob in his hand and listened to the sound he heard.\u00a0Behind the woman\u2019s laughter, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice was occasionally heard.\u00a0At the bottom of the stairs, a woman in a white chef outfit and Lee Wooyeon were seen talking face-to-face.\u00a0Rather than get angry at the chef who fed him the salted steak, he seemed to have decided to have a secret meeting with her.Choi Inseop stood close to the door and overheard their conversation.\u201cSo, you fed me a salted steak?\u201d\u201cYes. You came all the way here and went into the room without saying hello.\u00a0I never thought that the manager and you would be alone.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I came with the manager and was going to say hello later.\u201d\u201cLie.\u00a0Didn\u2019t you think of me at all?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon whispered something in her ear, the woman\u2019s laughter grew louder.\u00a0Choi In-eop sighed.\u00a0He knew that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s relationship with women was complicated, so this scene wasn\u2019t that shocking.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t just one or two shots of scenes with female celebrities as they followed him.This was not the kind of scene he was looking for.\u201c\u2026\u00a0what if though.\u201dHe took a picture of Lee Wooyeon and the female chef standing side by side with a cell phone.\u00a0It was because he thought that it might be useful someday if he put this together.Taking a picture, he closed the door as carefully as when he opened it.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who was walking down the hallway, took a deep breath as he checked the photos on his cell phone.\u201cThis, what are you doing?\u201dHe takes pictures, collects information about Lee Woo-yeon, and does his best not to offend him.\u00a0Others will think that he is a fan who has risen in status and has become a manager because he genuinely likes Lee Wooyeon.He hated Lee Wooyeon so much\u2026He put his cell phone in his pocket and went into the bathroom.\u00a0He wanted to wash his hands.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t a big deal, but he washed his hands whenever he felt bad.\u00a0The faucet was deliberately turned to the blue end.\u00a0He put his hands under the cold water and lathered the soap.\u00a0His fingers tingled as if they were about to freeze, but he meticulously lathered his hands and washed it off.\u00a0When the sensation disappeared and even the feeling of coldness disappeared, he put his swollen red finger to his cheek.He felt the cool sensation of freshness and the warmth that made his cells tingle at the same time.\u00a0Each time, he felt he was alive.His fingertips and cheeks became pale.\u00a0He looked at himself in the mirror.\u00a0The freckled, speechless, always frightened young self was staring back at him.\u00a0It looked at him with a scolding look asking him what the hell he was doing here.He shook his head and looked in the mirror again.\u00a0His frightened eyes remained the same, but the boy had grown a lot more than he did then.\u00a0Even the freckles could not be seen unless he looked closely.Although he did not get out of his childhood, he is now an adult.\u201cYou have to be strong.\u00a0For Jenny.\u201dWhen the name Jenny came out of his mouth, his heart throbbed like a habit.\u00a0In the remaining two months or so, he must somehow dig into Lee Wooyeon\u2019s true identity and obtain evidence.\u00a0He knew the other side of Lee Wooyeon, not the one that people liked.\u00a0And he had to let them know.\u00a0Because he made a promise.However, there was no evidence to prove Lee Wooyeon\u2019s true identity.In order to obtain the evidence, he followed him for a while and collected data.\u00a0Like a stalker, he collected and collected anything about Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0However, the only downside he could find in him was that he had a problem with women.\u00a0That was not enough.Proof that Lee Wooyeon was a rotten human from the very beginning was absolutely necessary.\u00a0It was his duty to find out and reveal to the world how dirty that man was, and what was hidden behind his friendly face.For Jenny \u2026\u00a0It must be for her.\u201cLet\u2019s see, you bastard\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201dChoi Inseop was startled by the sudden voice and turned around.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who suddenly entered the bathroom, came to his side and started washing his hands.His heart was beating so fast.\u00a0Could he have heard to what he was saying?\u00a0Maybe he knew something and entered the bathroom.\u00a0Was this place prepared today as a ploy by Lee Wooyeon, who actually knew everything?\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI made you wait.\u00a0Go and have dinner.\u201dHis expression was the same as usual.\u00a0He breathed a sigh of relief inwardly.\u00a0He thought it was still fine.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drive me home today.\u00a0I\u2019ll go by myself.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dHe naturally understood what Lee Wooyeon\u2019s conversation was with the woman on the stairs.\u00a0If possible, taking a sex video and uploading it would be one way.\u00a0It would be impossible even if he died and woke up.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ah, just thinking about such a scene made him feel guilty.\u201cAre you not feeling well?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe expression.\u201dAfter washing his hands, Lee Wooyeon looked for a handkerchief in his back pocket and pointed to Inseop in the mirror.\u00a0He realized that he was inadvertently pressing his stomach with his hand and making an impression.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u00a0It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate.\u00a0Hmm \u2026Did I leave it?\u201dChoi Inseop quickly pulled out a handkerchief from his pocket and held it out.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon accepted the handkerchief with a thank-you.He, who received the wet handkerchief back, grabbed the hem of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s robe as he was about to leave the bathroom.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cJust a second\u2026\u00a0look down.\u201dAt the manager\u2019s request, Lee Wooyeon bowed his head slightly.\u00a0Choi Inseop wiped the area aroundhis lips with a handkerchief.\u00a0Although it was excessively kind, Choi Inseop said to himself that it was an act that a manager should do.\u201cBecause there was lipstick on\u2026\u00a0It is gone now.\u201d\u201cMr. Choi Inseop is very kind.\u201dIn Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice, there was a bitter smile like salt that was felt in the wind on the beach.\u201c\u2026thank you.\u201dIf he could, he would slap Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cheek with his fist right now and swear at him.\u00a0He just wanted to tell him that a bastard like him should go to hell.\u00a0But it wouldn\u2019t be enough to inflict pain on even a hair on Lee Wooyeon like that.\u201cBut what were you going to say while having dinner\u2026\u201d\u201cI forgot.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and motioned for a quick return to the room.\u00a0He thought as he walked down the hallway following the back of Lee Wooyeon, whom he had hated so much.He hadn\u2019t gotten anything yet, but if he reached out his hand now, he could catch Lee Wooyeon, so that he could be done with this.\u2018Let\u2019s be satisfied with this\u2019, Choi Inseop comforted himself.Previous Chapter<All

fan for sure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201dChoi Inseop, who entered the company after saying that he was a fan of Lee Wooyeon, was embarrassed.\u00a0He tried to speak as if nothing happened.\u201cI\u2019m a fan.\u00a0But why?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve never seen Lee Wooyeon so quiet.\u00a0I-.\u00a0No, he was quiet in a different way when I was his manager for a while.\u201dManager Cha stroked his mustache with his hand, recalling the terrible memories of that time.\u201cLee Wooyeon praised you for doing a good job.\u201dCEO Kim also helped with a word.\u00a0Choi Inseop kept chewing his jajangmyeon and his face blushed as if embarrassed.\u00a0He approached Lee Wooyeon because he had a plan, but when he got compliments for that, his face went red.\u201cHe said it was comfortable because you manage everything accurately, including his own inclinations, tastes, personalities, routes, and schedules.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Because it is written in the notebook.\u201dIn the notebook that Manager Cha handed over during the takeover, there were simple precautions and essential things to know about Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0But he could not find anything about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s favorite types of bread, coffee preferences according to the weather, things to keep in mind while having a conversation, and how not to offend his mood.\u201cYou picked well.\u00a0To be honest, I was worried that you didn\u2019t have any experience to entrust you to Lee Wooyeon, but after seeing the report, I made a decision.\u00a0Obviously, Inseop is a fan by chance.\u00a0I acknowledge that.\u201dThis industry was a word-of-mouth rumor, so he couldn\u2019t make up his managerial career.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who was worried, wrote and submitted a report about Lee Wooyeon along with a resume introducing himself.\u00a0The report, which is close to 20 A4 papers, perfectly analyzed the details of actor Lee Wooyeon and the direction of his actions so far.\u00a0If there was a study called Lee Wooyeon, Choi Inseop submitted a perfect report to receive a doctorate degree.\u00a0After reading the report, CEO Kim shouted to bring him right away without looking at other resumes.\u201cWhy do you like Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou said you were a fan.\u00a0It\u2019s not common for a man to become a fan of a male actor, but\u2026\u00a0Is it that one?\u201dChoi Inseop raised his hand to the nape of his neck and hurriedly waved his hand.\u201cNo.\u00a0No.\u00a0I\u2019ve never thought of Lee Wooyeon like that for a moment.\u00a0I can swear to the Lord.\u201dHe said, raising the cross necklace hanging from his neck.\u00a0His wide-eyed eyes asserted his innocence.\u201cI do not care.\u00a0Even that one.\u00a0There are so many here.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s the truth.\u00a0I\u2019m not lying.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so naive.\u00a0CEO Kim secretly likes to make fun of people, so the more you do it, the more counterproductive.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s face turned even redder than before as manager Cha said with a smirk.\u00a0He took a notebook out of his pocket and started fumbling down.\u201cWhat are you writing?\u00a0The CEO likes to make fun of people\u2026 What.\u00a0Write it all down\u00a0Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201dCEO Kim, who took a sneak peek at Choi Inseop\u2019s notebook, laughed loudly and slapped his knee.\u00a0Manager Cha also pulled his head out to see if the words were true, then leaned back on the sofa and started laughing like crazy.\u201cPuhahahaha.\u00a0Why are you writing it down?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try to sort it out later.\u00a0That way I won\u2019t make mistakes\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you make a mistake?\u00a0And what sort of mistake is that?\u00a0Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201dWhile the two of them laughed out loud, Choi Inseop finished taking notes and quietly put the notebook back in his pocket.\u201cWhen I was young, I was a little slow to understand.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSo, I write down anything new first.\u00a0So it became a habit.\u00a0If you don\u2019t like it\u2026 I will remove it.\u201dInseop as a child was slower than any other children.\u00a0It was common for skinny children from the East to lag behind the Western children of the same age, but this was not the case.\u00a0Inseop was slow in speaking, slow in reading, writing, and even understanding things.\u00a0After he learned the letters, his mother put a post-it note on each object she saw with the name, usage, and description written on it.\u00a0He always wrote it down in a notebook, and before going to bed he read it over and over again.Now, he reached a level no different from other people, but the habit of that time remained and Choi Inseop wrote down anything new in his notebook.\u00a0Reading the notes he wrote before going to bed made his day feel organized, so he couldn\u2019t break the habit.\u00a0Of course, that habit was very helpful in analyzing Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0CEO Kim shook his head when he saw him making a worried expression while holding the pen he had just used to take notes.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0Write what you want to write.\u00a0At least write about my good fashion today.\u201dWhen CEO Kim spread his shoulders and said that, the manager Cha said, \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d and pretended to be disgusted.\u00a0Unable to forget the past when he was a model, CEO Kim still enjoyed having people\u2019s attention on him.\u00a0At that, Manager Cha shook his head saying that if the prince\u2019s disease continues at that age, it was now an incurable disease.\u201cThe president has to get that behaviour off.\u00a0What kind of representative cares more about clothes than celebrities?\u201d\u201cThen do you want me to go around messing about?\u00a0An obsolete celebrity photo.\u00a0Would you like something like that to appear?!\u201dThey tell the celebrities of the agency not to worry about malicious comments and forget about malicious articles, but CEO Kim turned on a fire and rushed in to confirm even a single passing picture of himself.\u00a0He even called the reporter who posted the strange photo and politely asked him to write another photo for the press.Although that part was human and fun, manager Cha, who built the company together with him, always clicked his tongue and begged CEO Kim to pay for the night.\u201cYou are great, sir.\u00a0Today, too.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dAt the words of Choi Inseop, CEO Kim\u2019s complexion brightened at once.\u00a0Inseop asked, taking out his notebook.\u201cShould I write down how cool you are today?\u00a0Yesterday too.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha. Why did you write that down? It would hurt to write the same content every day. Let me see. When did you write it down?\u201dWhen CEO Kim reached out to look at the notebook, manager Cha pushed his face away with the palm of his hand.\u201cAnyway, thank you so much for doing a good job.\u00a0I was very worried.\u201dAt a time when he did not understand exactly what the concept of conscience was, Choi Inseop could not distinguish the words conscience and heart well. This was because when his conscience was stabbed, the area near his heart hurt.It was like that now, too..\u00a0Choi Inseop answered with his head bowed while pressing his chest with his hands.\u201cThank you for your concern.\u00a0I will try harder.\u201dThe face of manager Cha, who looked at Inseop who was muttering in a tone like a simple country girl, was filled with regret.\u00a0How hard was it for such a good young man to deal with such a demon?\u201cHey.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dManager Cha looked around and lowered his voice.\u201cTell me if Lee Wooyeon is bothering you.\u00a0Or something strange happens.\u201d\u201cSomething strange?\u201d\u201cSo, suddenly\u2026\u201dCEO Kim motioned a hand and blocked the words of Manager Cha.\u201cThat\u2019s useless.\u201dIt was a completely different matter for Choi Inseop to divulge everything he liked and secrets as a manager.\u00a0CEO Kim frowned and blocked the words of Manager Cha.\u201cNo, though\u2026 because Inseop seems to be staying for a while.\u00a0Reporters these days say how many interviews Lee Wooyeon put in because of the change of manager.\u00a0There is also a limit to blocking articles.\u201dChoi Inseop pretended not to know and was absorbed in eating Jajangmyeon.\u00a0Even if he was cut off three months later, in order not to remain in the memory of these people, he had to quietly do the assigned work and then disappear.\u201cBut today, isn\u2019t it the day Lee Wooyeon starts filming the drama City?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0There was a script reading yesterday, and they said that they would start filming today.\u201dLike a student taking an exam, Choi Inseop spat out accurate information.\u201cThen why did you come to the office today?\u201d\u201cStarting in the afternoon, we have an outdoor filming for Drama City. The reason I came to the office today was because Lee Wooyeon came to pick up the items to take, and Kim told me to eat and leave, so I had time left\u2026 So I\u2019m eating jajangmyeon. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dSeeing Choi Inseop answering in a very tense posture, CEO Kim burst into laughter.\u201cHey, why are you so nervous?\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u00a0I\u2019m just asking out of curiosity, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201dHolding chopsticks, Choi Inseop looked at the faces of CEO Kim and Manager Cha alternately before releasing the strength on his shoulders.\u201cBut when it comes to outdoor shooting, isn\u2019t time tight?\u00a0Who will take Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cHe said he will just go directly to the area since he was closeby.\u201dAt the same time, CEO Kim and Manager Cha found the hidden meaning in the expression \u201cjust.\u201d\u00a0Manager Cha asked while chewing the pickled radish.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cLee Wooyeon, is he dating a girl?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInseop cut the noodles in the Jajangmyeon without a word with chopsticks.\u00a0Saying no was too obvious of a lie, and if he said yes, he felt like he was outing him, so he couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cWho is Lee Wooyeon dating now?\u201dCEO Kim also put a question on top of it.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who used his chopsticks to cut the jajangmyeon, quickly turned red and stood up from his seat.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll go first.\u201dManager Cha smiled broadly and pressed Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder to seat him back down.\u201cYou really are a fan of Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Loyalty is certain.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNot loyalty, but betrayal.\u00a0Observation and revenge as well.\u201cBut Lee Wooyeon is another one-act play.\u00a0The ratings aren\u2019t even coming up.\u201d\u201cLeave it.\u00a0It\u2019s a habit he has before starting a drama.\u201dLee Wooyeon was not picky about choosing a drama or movie.\u00a0If he wanted to feel moderately, he made a choice.\u00a0Although most of the works he appeared in were hits, he didn\u2019t only appear in popular works.Lee Wooyeon liked single-act plays.\u00a0He especially liked the short dramas of trilogy, tetralogy, and so on, which broadcasters occasionally feature.The one-act play ended before it even became popular, the ratings were not high, and the fee was small.\u00a0In a word, it would not be an exaggeration to say that there were very few cases where an actor of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s rank appears in a one-act play.\u00a0Despite the disapproval of his agency, Lee Wooyeon enjoyed appearing in a one-act play.He said in an interview that short time to be immersed in a different role is a good practice, but CEO Kim insisted that he had a plan.\u201cThe one-act play in which Lee Wooyeon appears has a good script and completeness.\u00a0It may not seem helpful right now from the company\u2019s point of view, but I think it will definitely help in the future.\u00a0The reaction is good not only from fans, but also from general viewers.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop answered, recalling some of the information he had investigated about Lee Wooyeon, CEO Kim and Manager Cha looked at each other\u2019s faces at the same time.\u201cYou really are a fan!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a fan.\u00a0You\u2019re definitely a fan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s right, fan.\u201dCEO Kim said with a genuinely moved face.\u201cWork for a long time.\u00a0Next to our Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dChoi Inseop answered and stood up from his seat.\u00a0It was painful to be here any longer.\u00a0Although he volunteered to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fan, it was difficult for him to pretend to be a fan as he was not a fan.\u00a0It would have been better to just quietly record, manage, drive, and serve by Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side.\u201cI\u2019ll get up first.\u201d\u201cYou want to go right away?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0If I go now, I think I will be able to reach on time.\u201dIt seemed that he would arrive 30 minutes earlier than the given time, but Choi Inseop preferred to wait rather than to rush.\u201cThen see you later.\u00a0I had a good meal.\u201d\u201cAre you going to leave then?\u201d\u201cAre you going to go like that?\u201dBoth of them opened their eyes wide and grabbed Inseop\u2019s clothes.It was less than 30 minutes by car to the amusement park.\u00a0He had already prepared for Lee Wooyeon to come and visit, so there wasn\u2019t any problem.When two people blocked him with serious faces, Choi Inseop could not hide his confusion.\u201cI am\u2026\u00a0did something go wrong?\u201dIf there was something that he did not know, he vowed to write it down in his notebook, and hewaited for the two of them to answer.\u201c\u2026Hmm\u2026\u201dIn front of the large mirror at the entrance of the amusement park, Choi Inseop fixed his attire with a dissatisfied expression.It was the first time he had worn clothes other than a suit since he started working.\u00a0He lied and said he was two years older than his original age, and he insisted on wearing a suit.\u00a0CEO Kim said he would freeze to death since it was an outdoor shoot, and took him to a nearby shop and bought him casual jeans and a goose-down jumper.\u00a0Manager Cha said that it would be necessary, and he bought him thermal pants that were in fashion these days.Choi Inseop cried and changed clothes bitterly and\u00a0came all the way here, as the two said that he would not be able to take a step forward unless he changed his clothes.In the United States, he thought he looked younger than others because he was Asian. However, after coming to Korea and finding out that people see him as younger than his original age, Choi Inseop had to accept that he was young.Even on the day he learned about it, Inseop wrote down a sentence in his notebook, \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m young.\u201dHe was terribly dissatisfied with his appearance.\u00a0He didn\u2019t like his weakly curved back, his skinny body, his frightened big eyes, round nose tip, the freckles, and his white skin.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dHe stood in front of the mirror and let out a long sigh.\u00a0Caressing the collar with an awkward hand, he checked the time on his cell phone as usual.\u201cI\u2019m late!\u201dChoi Inseop hastened his steps.\u00a0Due to the unexpected shopping, the time was delayed, and it seemed that it was close to the appointment time.\u00a0But he didn\u2019t run.\u00a0He could run, but he just walked fast with wide strides, like someone who didn\u2019t know how to run.He walked like that, took a deep breath, and then walked again.\u00a0In the end, when he arrived at his appointment, he was ten minutes late.Rumors that Lee Wooyeon was filming a drama here had already spread, and the surrounding area was crowded with people flocking to take a look.When Lee Wooyeon, who was reading the script among the bodyguards, moved to this place to have a conversation with the director, women started rushing to see his face even once.\u201cUh, wait\u2026\u00a0just a second\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe could only get to Lee Wooyeon only by squeezing through that gap.\u201cHey!\u00a0Wooyeon Oppa!\u201d\u201cOppa!\u00a0I love you!\u00a0Oppa!\u201d\u201cOppa, pleaselook here.\u201dPushing, stepping on foot, pushing and screaming, it was hell.\u00a0The FDs of the drama filming team and the amusement park agents made a barricade to stop the women from flocking and pushed them away.\u00a0Choi Inseop, with a thin trembling voice to those who pushed him, said, \u201cI\u2019m the manager, get out of the way, wait a minute, I\u2019m the manager, I\u2019m the manager,\u201d\u00a0but no one listened to the young man.\u00a0Even after being pushed and beaten several times by people\u2019s shoulders and elbows, he did not stop identifying himself.He explained to the FD that he was the manager, but they didn\u2019t even make eye contact.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who wore casual clothes rather than a suit, was hard to see, even if he was more tolerant than a freshman in college.\u00a0There was no way for them to hear the words of a young man who desperately shouted that he was a manager among the women.\u201cMa, this is the manager.\u00a0Excus\u2026, get out of the way, I\u2019m the manager.\u00a0Ma\u2026!\u201dThe barricade collapsed.\u00a0Extreme fans rushed through the gap.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who lost his balance and fell to the floor, learned what the fear of being trampled to death was.\u00a0As he crouched down to reduce the impact as much as possible, holding his head with both hands, a hand reached out from the crowd, grabbed his wrist and pulled him closer.\u00a0As the high-pitched screams spread out, his vision brightened.\u00a0When Choi Inseop realized that he had fallen over someone\u2019s body, he was embarrassed and shouted out loud.\u201cSorry.\u00a0I am a manager\u2026!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dA friendly voice came from overhead.\u00a0Even without raising his head, he could tell who it was.\u201cYou are a little late today.\u00a0Manager.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026, Yes.\u201dHe stood up from his seat.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took off his clothes and stood up and smiled.\u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognise you.\u00a0You\u2019re not wearing a suit today.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0They told me that I had to wear this because you were shooting outdoors\u2026 If you don\u2019t want me to, I\u2019ll change clothes.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0I-\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was looking around as the security personnel and FDs cleared the scene, held out his hand as if he remembered it.\u201cThe thing I ask for?\u201d\u201cYes, here it is.\u201dHe took out the small box he had brought from the office out of his pocket.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon opened the box and looked at it and smiled.\u201cThank you.\u00a0It would have been difficult without this.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dInside the box was a small pink pebble.\u00a0It was in a box inside the office cabinet, so he asked him to bring it to the set today.\u00a0he brought it at once, but Choi Inseop did not fully understand what he was going to use it for.\u201cIt\u2019s my lucky stone.\u201d\u201cLuck\u2026\u00a0\u00a0Ah, the stone of fortune.\u201dChoi Inseop tilted his head.Did Lee Wooyeon believe in superstitions?\u00a0Wasn\u2019t it the other way around?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He has to go home tonight and edit the information.\u201cWhen I first started filming, there was a beach scene.\u00a0This is the stone I picked up at that time.\u00a0I just put it in my pocket without thinking, and it became a jinx.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0I understand.\u201dInseop nodded his head with a serious face, as he had read a book about how superstition plays an important role in Eastern culture.\u201cBefore filming starts, I have to touch it to relax my mind.\u00a0Isn\u2019t it a little stupid?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s not.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed his finger on the stone and lightly rubbed it a couple of times, then closed the box lid again and returned it to Choi Inseop.\u201cYou keep it and give it back before you leave today.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dChoi Inseop carefully put the box back into his pocket.\u00a0It was a big deal if he lost it, so he vowed to stay with one hand in his pocket today.\u201cIf you are unrelated, please leave.\u00a0We have to start filming.\u201dA man wearing sunglasses, who appeared to be the site manager, approached Choi Inseop and motioned for him to leave.\u201cHello.\u00a0I am Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop bowed to greet him, he thought \u2018Is that a man?\u2019\u00a0and made a puzzled face.\u201cYou look young, so I thought students were coming to play.\u00a0Wait over there.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Thank you.\u201dHaving said that, he waited near Lee Wooyeon for his instructions.\u201cGo somewhere warm and have a cup of coffee.\u00a0It\u2019s your first time filming a drama, so you\u2019ll be very bored.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Lee Wooyeon for even a moment.\u00a0For now, it was the best he could do.\u201cIt would be boring.\u00a0You don\u2019t care because you\u2019re my fan?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u00a0Yes.\u201dIt was difficult to pretend to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fan in front of other people, but the most difficult thing was pretending to be a fan in front of him.\u00a0However, there was no other choice but to avoid suspicion.\u201cAs a fan, whatever you do, it\u2019s fun to watch.\u201dSaying that, he bowed his head.\u00a0It was because he did not have the courage to make eye contact with Lee Wooyeon.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smile shook the air around him.\u00a0His laughter sounded like a harp from heaven, and he remembered Jenny\u2019s voice.\u00a0As if tears were about to fall, he quickly tightened his fists and raised his head.\u201cMr. Wooyeon.\u201dIn this drama, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s co-star, Jang Yeonsoo, brought a little boy who appeared to be four or five years old and called out his name.\u201cWho is this one?\u00a0Do I know you?\u201d\u201cI am the manager.\u00a0Please take good care of me.\u201dWherever he went, Choi Inseop always bowed politely to greet.\u00a0There was no way he was an arrogant manager.\u201cI thought he was your younger brother because he is young.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t even look like a manager.\u201d\u201cClothes\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cHe works well.\u201dLee Wooyeon answered instead of him.\u201cHe is the best and most sincere person among managers so far.\u201dChoi Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon with surprised eyes.\u00a0He was not at ease because he could not believe the sincerity of the man who praised him in a serious and soft voice.\u00a0Even though he was wearing a warm jumper, his fingertips were cold.\u201cWho is this pretty little boy?\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed to the child hiding behind Jang Yeonsoo and asked.\u201cThe child actor that I\u2019m working with this time. Say hi, Jiha-ya.\u201d.A little boy who looked about five years old looked at Lee Wooyeon and cried and grabbed the skirt of Jang Yeonsoo again.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon knelt down and tried to make eye contact, but the girl turned her head.\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u00a0You\u2019re not a shy kid.\u00a0Say hello,\u00a0baby.\u00a0This is the uncle you have to play with.\u201d\u201cHi.\u00a0Is your name Jiha?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon spoke, this time the girl burst out crying.\u00a0In embarrassment, Jang Yeonsoo tried to hold the child and calm her down, but the child did not stop crying.\u00a0It was not easy to even lie on the floor and give strength to the whole body and hold her.\u201cWhere did your mother go?\u201dWhen Jang Yeonsoo looked for the child\u2019s mother, the staff next to her hurriedly said that she was in the bathroom, and looked around.\u201cI\u2019ll hold her.\u201dChoi Inseop held the baby instead of Jang Yeonsoo.\u00a0The child cried and struggled.\u00a0Choi Inseop was thankful that he came in comfortable clothes instead of a suit today for the first time.\u00a0Patting the child on the back, he began to walk around the set.\u00a0After a while, the child stopped crying.\u201cAre you raising children?\u00a0You look good.\u201d\u201cI took care of my brothers.\u201dHe responded by patting the child\u2019s back with the palm of his hand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked at Inseop and tilted his head slightly.\u201cBrother?\u00a0Do you have a younger brother?\u201dChoi Inseop recalled that he had bought another Choi Inseop\u2019s name and quickly added.\u201cMy cousin.\u201d\u201cYou seem to like children.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I like them.\u00a0Ah\u2026 fell asleep.\u201dIt must have been because of the unfamiliar environment and drowsiness.\u00a0Choi Inseop continued to pat the child on the back, thinking that the child actors also have a lot of trouble.\u201cThat is great.\u00a0Look after the child while we\u2019re filming.\u00a0When I saw her mother, she didn\u2019t really care for her, and she seemed to be flirting with the PD and being crazy.\u201dJang Yeonsoo laughed at Inseop, uttering a venomous remark without hesitation.\u00a0When he nodded that he would, Lee Wooyeon intervened in their conversation.\u201cHe\u2019s my manager.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s my manager, but he\u2019s taking care of other people.\u201d\u201cWhew.\u00a0Wooyeon, too.\u201dAlthough she was not a first-class actor, Jang Yeonsoo, who was known for her good personality and acting, did not hesitate to slap Lee Wooyeon on the shoulder and smile.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was smiling too, but he didn\u2019t seem very happy.While holding the child, Choi Inseop glanced at Lee Wooyeon with anxious eyes.\u00a0If that person had a temper, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold him back because he was holding a child right now.\u201cOh.\u00a0Did my Jiha fall asleep?\u201dWhen the child\u2019s mother came, she was surprised to see Choi Inseop with her child, and asked.\u201cYes.\u00a0You must be tired.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u00a0She\u2019s not the kind of kid who sleeps in the arms of anyone.\u201d\u201cShe must have been very tired.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon said that, Choi Inseop did not miss the twinkling eyes of the child\u2019s mother.\u201cOh, she will start filming in a little while.\u00a0What to do?\u00a0Should I wake her up?\u201dAs she spoke, her gaze was fixed on Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Choi Inseop shook his head, patting the child who was still whining.\u201cYou can do it after she sleeps a little\u2026\u201dBefore his reply was even finished, the child\u2019s mother said to Lee Wooyeon that she was looking forward to this work, that she had been a fan before, and that seeing the real thing in person was much nicer.Jang Yeonsoo, who made eye contact with Choi Inseop, shrugged her shoulders as if it was the case and left.\u00a0The mother of the child, Lee Wooyeon, who was somehow uncomfortable, and Choi Inseop, who is holding the child, were trapped in the awkward air.\u201cMy child is really good at acting.\u00a0She also has a dream of being an actress.\u00a0Please take care of her when you\u2019re together.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I will try to.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop saw the girl asleep in his arms, he wondered what kind of dream this little child had.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon gestured to him.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGo and buy me some coffee.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0It\u2019s cold, so my throat is a bit numb.\u201d\u201cSorry. I will prepare it right away.\u201dWhen he was struggling with holding the child, Lee Wooyeon took the child and gave it to her mother.\u201cI\u2019d like a latte, please.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dChoi Inseop asked the staff the location of the coffee shop and moved on.\u00a0By the time he came back after buying coffee, they had already started filming.\u00a0He put the coffee in his hands to keep it from cooling down and waited for the director to shout \u201cCut\u201d.When it was time to wait for filming, Choi Inseop approached Lee Wooyeon and offered the coffee.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who took a sip of coffee while reading the script, muttered without looking at him.\u201cThe coffee is cold.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0Can I buy it for you again?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0Never mind.\u201dHe said so, but Lee Wooyeon stopped drinking the coffee and placed it on a nearby table.\u00a0Inseop broke into cold sweats.\u00a0It was the first mistake he made since becoming his manager.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked nervously at the cold coffee and Lee Wooyeon alternately.\u00a0\u2019What do I do, should I go and buy it again?\u00a0What should I say?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0What would I do if he fired me?\u2019\u201cHave you read the script?\u201dWhen asked suddenly, he raised his head, saying, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0and shook his head.\u201cThis script.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u00a0I read.\u201dChoi Inseop read all the scripts for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s dramas and movies.\u00a0Of course, it was the same after he became a manager.\u00a0Not only this short drama, but also the script for the historical drama which will be released soon.\u201cHow can this man like a divorced woman who has children?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cCan you understand that he likes a person with all these shortcomings?\u201dIt was a random question.\u00a0Choi Inseop thought about it for a while and answered, not knowing what the intention of that person was asking him this question.\u201cIf you like it, really, if you like it, that kind of thing doesn\u2019t matter, maybe.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed at his answer.\u201cI think it would matter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI hate mourning.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cJust a joke.\u00a0A joke.\u201dOrdinary people would say that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words were a joke or that their ears heard wrong, but Choi Inseop couldn\u2019t.\u201cDo you hate kids?\u201d\u201cPlease.\u00a0No way.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who said so, hugged the child actor who woke up. When the child whined, a friendly lullaby in her ear and a whispering voice burned the hearts of the women around him. When the child quickly stopped crying, Lee Wooyeon smiled at Choi Inseop, saying, \u201cLook at it.\u201d White and neat teeth showed a pleasant smile to others, but it was a creepy smile to Choi Inseop.\u2018Philip is a swindler.\u00a0Oh.\u00a0When he smiles, it makes me think it doesn\u2019t matter what happens to me right now.\u00a0He is looking at me and smiling.\u00a0But pretending not to see me, and deliberately walking with another woman to tease me.\u00a0He is truly a gifted swindler.\u2019Jenny\u2019s voice, wet with joy, came from somewhere.\u00a0Choi Inseop turned his head and ignored Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smile.Shortly thereafter, filming resumed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was a great actor.\u00a0With the way he leads the other actors as well as the young child actors well, he could understand why he was praised as a top actor.Choi Inseop pressed the cold fingertips with his thumb.\u00a0It was then that a little pain spread and he felt the blood circulate.If he didn\u2019t know about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s true nature, he would have been deceived by such a figure and admired him.\u00a0If he didn\u2019t know Lee Wooyeon\u2019s true form\u2026 Was it true that he knew Lee Wooyeon\u2019s true face?\u00a0Can he trust Jenny and her words and think that Wooyeon was a garbage human?\u00a0\u2026 No. He has to believe.\u00a0He has to trust Jenny.Choi Inseop shook his head and made up his mind.\u00a0Every time the wind blew past his fingertips, it felt like a sharp pain cut through his heart.In the cold wind, Choi Inseop silently watched Lee Wooyeon acting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Love History Caused by Willful NegligenceCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIf we just film this scene, it\u2019s over, so let\u2019s do our best.\u201dThe director shouted, encouraging the staff and actors. Everyone suffered because of the exceptionally cold weather. Choi Inseop found out why CEO Kim and Manager Cha sent him wearing such thick jumpers, and as he faced the cold with his whole body.Every time he moved to the filming location, he was busy just controlling the crowds, but today Lee Wooyeon had a lot of demands. He wished he had hot green tea, he wanted to wipe his hands with a hot towel, a hot pack or hot coffee will relieve his throat, he wanted to sit in a comfortable chair, etc.Choi Inseop had been busy all day without a break, fulfilling his continuous requests. At the same time, he was unable to straighten his back because he looked after the child actor that the mother had thrown him from time to time.Lee Wooyeon was drinking hot green tea and looking at Choi Inseop carrying a waiting child actor. As Jang Yeonsoo said, the child\u2019s mother was having insignificant conversations with the director, so she didn\u2019t seem to care about the child. Choi Inseop put the balloon he had bought with his own money into the child\u2019s hand and was acting like a nanny. A smile was drawn on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips.It was the car he was thinking of firing the manager. Choi Inseop was the perfect manager who accurately understood and matched his tastes and personality. He was quiet, quick-witted, and had a good personality. It was perfect. He was such a perfect manager that he really wanted to ask where he got these people from.So Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t like Choi Inseop. Being overly perfect.It was as if Choi Inseop had researched to become Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager and fit himself into that frame. Most of all, it was funny that he claimed to be his fan. At first he thought it was so, but quickly realized that he was lying from the look in his eyes.Lee Wooyeon was a natural actor. He was able to figure out at once whether he really liked him or if he was pretending to like him.The new manager wasn\u2019t his fan. He knew all the information about Lee Wooyeon that he could never know unless he was a fan, but he was not a fan. However, he claimed to be a fan himself and tried his best to catch Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s fun, but that\u2019s it.\u201dHe muttered as he looked at Choi Inseop, who was keeping an eye on him even while carrying the child.\u2018I mean, it\u2019s fun, but the mood is so gloomy. So, I\u2019ll have to change it now.\u2019\u201cMr. Lee Wooyeon.\u201dChoi Inseop, who was approaching him, called out his name. He continued to speak without a sign of difficulty, even though he was constantly breathing hard because the child was heavy.\u201cI made a reservation for a salon today, but I will change the time.\u201d\u201cOkay. It may be later than I thought.\u201dThere were many variables for outdoor shooting, so it was common to end much later than the expected time. Since CEO Kim insisted that cold wind was bad for the skin and that it must be taken care of after outdoor filming, Lee Wooyeon has often done so. Today, he forgot about it for a while, but the new manager seemed to have not forgotten that fact while he was frantically taking care of him and the child actors.\u201cI think Inseop is really talented.\u201d\u201c\u2026I am just doing my job.\u201dEvery time he heard compliments, Choi Inseop showed a confused look, not knowing where to put his eyes. It was not a pleasant embarrassment accompanied by shame. It was clearly visible that he was somewhat displeased with what the other person said and did not know what to do to hide it.\u201cBecause you are the manager? Or are you a fan?\u201d\u201cIt is both\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed.It would have been really nice if this were excluded. It was obvious that he didn\u2019t like it, but it was like he was desperately trying to catch the other person\u2019s attention.Fun but annoying. However, the displeasure was much greater, so Lee Wooyeon decided to change the manager as soon as possible.\u201cMr. Wooyeon. You can sit here. We\u2019re only fleming your facial expressions without lines, okay? You can take Yeonsoo\u2019s hand. Without talking.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMiss Yeonsoo, Are you good with rides?\u201d\u201cOf course. I like it very much\u201d\u201cAre you okay, Mr. Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that scary, so don\u2019t worry. If you are afraid, you can scream. I\u2019ll edit that scene. Extras don\u2019t shout too much. The mic is out.\u201dPeople burst into laughter at the director\u2019s joke and got on the ride. Lee Wooyeon took Jang Yeonsoo\u2019s hand and let her enter the ride first, and he sat next to her.\u201cIs a seat vacant?\u201dThe assistant director, who was checking the seat, pointed to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s back seat and said.\u201cWhat? Who is it? Just ride anyone.\u201d\u201cAnyone from the lighting team over there.\u201dThe assistant director shouted, but no one willingly stepped forward. It wasn\u2019t about other seats, but it seemed burdensome to appear on the screen because it was right behind Lee Wooyeon.\u201cThere, Mr. Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cTake a ride. If you are afraid, you can keep your head down.\u201d\u201cMe? \u2026 Me, me?\u201dChoi Inseop asked, stammering as he was quite scared.\u201cIt\u2019s not that scary. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026, I don\u2019t like this\u2026 \u201d\u201cWhat are you so afraid of? Hurry up.\u201dWhen the director motioned for him to get on, Choi Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon with a bright red face. In a brief glance, Lee Wooyeon was able to read what the manager wanted from him.\u2018Help me.\u2019\u201cIf you\u2019re scared, take my hand.\u201dLee Wooyeon turned her gaze to Jang Yeonsoo and spoke kind words. The manager\u2019s circumstances were outside his domain. If the manager quits his job because of this, that wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing either.\u201cIf Wooyeon is scared too, hold my hand. I will hold you tight.\u201dJang Yeonsoo lowered the safety bar and answered with a pleasant voice.Choi Inseop, who became white, pushed his back and sat down. It seems that the child actor was taken by the child\u2019s mother.\u201cI, Director, \u2026There, I\u2026 \u201dChoi Inseop called the director with a soft voice to see if he had something to say, but he was too busy paying attention to the camera position.\u201cI, there. Mr. Wooyeon\u2026 \u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThere, there, I\u2026 , I am\u2026 \u201dSeeing the face of Choi Inseop, who was scared enough to look pitiful, Jang Yeonsoo asked as if she was worried.\u201cAre you okay? Mr. Wooyeon\u2019s manager must be really scared.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re scared, will you hold my hand?\u201dLee Wooyeon playfully held out his hand and smiled. Choi Inseop pursed his lips and shook his head. Security guards walked around and lowered the safety bar.\u201cNo! I am\u2026 ! Hello!\u201dChoi Inseop shouted something, but the sound of the safety bar squeaking and locking echoed heavily.\u201cThere, there\u2026 !\u201d\u201cThere, Mr. Wooyeon\u2019s manager. Everything is recorded in the audio, so please be quiet and start filming. Ready, start.\u201dThe director gave the cue sign.Choi Inseop grabbed the safety bar with a pale face and bowed his head. When Lee Wooyeon saw him trembling in fear, he smiled lightly.\u201cHold on tight.\u201dHe whispered to Jang Yeonsoo and looked at Choi Inseop.The ride started moving.\u201cI met the prince.\u201d\u201cYes? Again?\u201d\u201cYes. I met the prince. This time, I\u2019m sure it must be the prince I have been waiting for.\u201dEvery time Jenny moved, the floor squeaked. The elbows of her old pink cardigan were so worn out that they couldn\u2019t be patched up any longer, and her black skirt was shiny enough to tell when she washed it.Jenny smiled broadly, revealing her crooked teeth. She sat down on Peter\u2019s bedside and clasped her hands.\u201cToday, Sandra, that damn bitch fucked me up. Knocked me over, damn bitch. What a fucking bitch.\u201dJenny was angry with her face that said she was unhappy. Peter, who had been lying in bed all day reading a book, listened to her as if it was interesting.\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cI fell. in the middle of the hallway. That damn bitch will giggle and laugh with the soccer boys and ask \u2018Are you okay?\u2019. Not to me, but to the hallway.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s mean. She will be punished.\u201dPeter frowned and nodded. A girl named Sandra, who he only knew through stories told by Jenny, was a bitch like no other in the world.\u201cEveryone laughed. I was picking up a pen that had fallen out of my pencil case. Did I tell you about my favorite pen? Aunt Spencer\u2026\u201d\u201cThe only pear-shaped pen in the world that Aunt Spencer gave you as a birthday present!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s right.\u201dJenny smiled brightly. It was a story he had heard countless times, but every time he heard it, Peter had a happy expression on his face. The only friend who comes to the attic.\u201cIt rolled over. So I reached out to pick it up!\u201dJenny\u2019s cheeks were dyed rosy. Seeing her blue eyes twinkle, Peter was as excited as it was his job and waited for the next word.\u201cThat person picked it up. My pen! The one and only pen in the world! It was an elegant and beautiful finger. He had black hair and black eyes just like you.\u201dWith the words black eyes and black hair, Peter felt sympathy for the prince of Jenny, who did not know his face.\u201cIs he like me?\u201d\u201cAh no. Not at all.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d\u201cPeter, Peter. I love you more than anyone, but the prince and you are completely different. He is a quarterback.\u201d\u201cQuarterback?\u201dJenny\u2019s school was famous for its soccer team. Peter couldn\u2019t help but be surprised to learn that Asians were playing as quarterbacks there.\u201cHe\u2019s tall and handsome, and how good his voice is. He asked me if I was okay and handed me the pen. He has a voice like chocolate.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 there are people like that.\u201dJenny\u2019s prince seemed to be a person who couldn\u2019t be compared with him, who was weak and skinny, and whose daily life was to lie in bed and read a book.\u201cHe studies very well.\u201d\u201cAwesome.\u201d\u201cAnd he is also very popular with women. That damn Sandra is one of those girls who\u2019s been chasing the prince!\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 \u201dAsian boys were usually not popular. Asian girls were often liked\u00a0 because of their mysterious charms, but men weren\u2019t. Because they were compared to Westerners in terms of physical condition, most of the girls did not feel attracted to them.\u201cHe is a very friendly person with a smile. The prince.\u201dWhenever Peter listened to Jenny\u2019s explanation, the image of the prince he had in his head became more and more concrete.Tall stature, beautiful hands, a chocolate-like voice, and a friendly smile. Quarterback.\u201cForget it. I\u2019m definitely going to the graduation party with the prince. Sandra, Rachel, Kelly, Emily, and all the girls, I will kiss the prince as much as I want!\u201dAs she listed the names of the girls who bullied her, Jennifer\u2019s blue eyes burned with enthusiasm. Peter burst out laughing. It was because Jenny\u2019s voice was so serious.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u201d\u201cWhy are you laughing! funny?\u201d\u201cNo, just. Because it\u2019s fun. You just met today, have you already imagined that far?\u201d\u201cOf course. We will have five children. The youngest of them will take your name. You are the godfather of our children. It would be nice if his mysterious black eyes and my blue eyes were half and half mixed!\u201dShe said, putting her hands together like a girl in a dream.\u201cJennifer! Jennifer! Where the hell did this damn pig bitch go! Jennifer!\u201dA phlegm-like voice from the window started looking for Jenny. It was Jenny\u2019s mother, Matilda. Matilda always looked tired, wearing a black dress that was always tight on her body and without makeup. At six o\u2019clock, she called her daughter with a force that seemed to kill her without fail. The whole town hated Matilda\u2019s shouts, but no one could shut her mouth. As a devout Mormon, she saw not meeting mealtimes as a sin. The couple took the rod without hesitation to the daughter who committed the crime. The locals hated the eccentric couple who believed in heresy. No one liked their daughter Jenny.Jenny\u2019s only friend was the shy, skinny Asian boy next door. And for Peter, Jenny was his only friend.\u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201dAs Jenny got up from the bed with a smile, the sheets on the bed wobbled. She gave Peter a kiss on his sweaty cheek.\u201cBye. Don\u2019t be sick. Are you going to the hospital tomorrow?\u201d\u201cYes. For regular check-ups.\u201d\u201cYou should get well soon and go to school with me.\u201d\u201cWait. I will be going back to school in March.\u201dThey both knew it was an unconfirmed promise, but no one showed any signs of it. Peter, who had undergone several surgeries for congenital heart disease, had a seizure while walking not long ago, and now spends most of his time lying down.He has had three surgeries so far. It was almost impossible for Peter to go back to school.\u201cWhen I die, I will give you my heart. My dear Peter.\u201dJenny stood by the doorway and looked at Peter. It was her farewell to Peter all the time. Peter replied with a smile.\u201cYour heart won\u2019t fit me. Besides, if I got it, I\u2019d fall in love with your school soccer team one after another, right? I don\u2019t want to be gay.\u201dJenny laughed. Every time she smiled, her protruding teeth stood out even more. Peter liked Jenny. It wasn\u2019t a romantic attraction, he just liked the human being Jenny.He always thought it was unfair for people to ignore her charm because she was loud, delusional, fat, and badly dressed.Peter pulled out a notebook lying next to the bed and held it. He had a habit of writing down his daily routine or anything else in his notebook. These days, the conversations with Jenny were all written in the notebook, but even that was enjoyable for him.\u201cBye. Jennie.\u201d\u201cBye. Peter.\u201dAfter saying bye, Peter, holding the pen in his hand, called Jenny to stop her.\u201cJenny!\u201d\u201cWhat,\u201d she said, turning her head.\u201cWhat is the prince\u2019s name?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lee Wooyeon closed the book he was reading. Inseop stared blankly at the movement of his fingers. As Jenny said, they were long and beautiful fingers.\u201cDo you have a headache?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. If I had known you wouldn\u2019t like it that much, I would have stopped you. I never thought you would pass out.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Did I faint? Me?\u201dChoi Inseop traced his memory. He had never been on a ride because of his congenitally weak heart. Now, he can do activities similar to ordinary people, but rides were still psychologically unreasonable for him.\u201cYes. You got off the ride and passed out right away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop bit his lip. Come to think of it, he couldn\u2019t even imagine it. An adult man who faints after riding a ride.\u201cFortunately, there was a doctor among the people waiting to ride the rides and looked after you, but they said that you just passed out. So I brought you to the car, would you like to go to the hospital?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop tried to stand up, Lee Wooyeon raised his hand and stopped him.\u201cLie down more. After all, Manager Cha will take some time to come from the province.\u201d\u201cIs Manager Cha coming?\u201d\u201cYes. You passed out, so the manager said that he was coming. It will take about an hour. Lay down and rest.\u201dChoi Inseop touched his head with his hands. He passed out, and even the chief of staff had to come here. Today was really the worst day.\u201c\u2026 Filming?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Everything went smoothly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026\u201dHe muttered helplessly. Lee Wooyeon laughed. Every time he saw that smiling face, Inseop\u2019s heart ached.Prince-like face, sweet smile.It was all a lie and it sounded like Jenny\u2019s screams, telling him to quickly tell the people his true nature.Lee Wooyeon reached out and placed his hand on Inseop\u2019s face. He froze on the spot with the feeling of his hair standing up.\u201cYour face is red. I thought you might have a fever.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dHe stood up. Much better than before. Even when he moved his body, he didn\u2019t feel dizzy.\u201cI will contact the manager and tell him that I will just drive and go.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Rest. There is nothing urgent, right?\u201dEven if he died soon, there was no word from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth that he would drive back. Among the information Choi Inseop found out, it seemed to be true that Lee Wooyeon never drove with anyone.\u201cBecause of me\u2026 sorry.\u201dHe bowed his head and apologized. Lee Wooyeon laughed it off. In this way, he was a very kind and nice person.He gradually lost his confidence. Will he be able to discover the nature hidden within that thick mask?\u201cAh. That\u2019s right. Mr. Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cCan you give me back what I left with you?\u201d\u201cAh, ah\u2026 rock. lucky stone.\u201dChoi Inseop answered while rummaging through his pockets. But the box was not where it should have been. He looked in the other side just in case, but it was the same.\u201cUh, uh\u2026 \u201dHe got up from his seat in bewilderment and banged his head on the roof of the car.\u201cWhy? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cNo, the box was definitely there before\u2026\u00a0 I\u2019m sure\u2026 \u201dEven though he was busy, he put his hand in his pocket and checked the box every now and then. Until he got on the ride.\u201cDid you lose it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dIt was evident that the box in his pocket fell while riding the ride. Fear of riding a roller coaster for the first time, he did not even think about having to leave the box with someone.\u201cI think I dropped it while riding a ride.\u201d\u201cUm, I see.\u201dHis expression grew more and more pale. He looked even paler than when he got off the ride.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019\u2019s okay. Things like that happen.\u201d\u201c\u2026 sorry. It is all my fault.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s shoulders shrank more and more. He had a frightened face, like a child with his hand in the head of a lion.Lee Wooyeon felt better. To be so sorry for a stone that was so insignificant. The new manager fell like a piece of paper even if burned a little. He was sure. That he can fire this human off any time he wanted.\u201cII can\u2019t helped. It was a precious thing, but what can you do with what you\u2019ve already lost?\u201dPrecious thing.It changed often. He put stones, leaves, and key chains in a box inside the cabinet and asked the manager to hold it for a while, saying something like a lucky charm. Seizing the opportunity, he didn\u2019t forget to steal the item and throw it in the trash. The reactions of those who were afflicted with this childish, dog-like trick were almost identical. It was embarrassment at first, then sorry, then resentment. It was a consistent excuse that they clearly had the item, but that it had disappeared.\u2018Tt\u2019s gone because I took it.\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and said, but Choi Inseop didn\u2019t say anything. An awkward silence passed inside the car.\u201cI will go to the bathroom for a while.\u201dChoi Inseop stood up and muttered. Lee Wooyeon nodded and opened the book he was reading earlier.Choi Inseop, who went out like that, did not come back. He closed the book only after confirming that it had been 20 minutes since he left the Benz.\u2018Where else did you fall?\u2019Recalling Choi Inseop\u2019s pale face as he left, Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue. It didn\u2019t matter whether he fell or not, but if something went wrong, his name would be up and down in the newspaper. There were too many eyes that saw Choi Inseop, who fainted, to pretend not to know.\u201cYou are bothering me.\u201dLee Wooyeon put his hat on and went out. He had to walk for a long time to go to the bathroom because he purposely parked the car far away. Hoping that Choi Inseop was lying nearby, he moved on.However, there was no body of the fallen manager in the nearby bathroom or nearby. Choi Inseop\u2019s words came to mind as he was wondering whether he was going to call manager Cha.\u201cNo way.\u201dHe walked towards the roller coaster where he was filming. It was a cold winter, so there were few guests left until this time. Profanity came out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth along with a breath.\u201cWhere the hell is this bastard?\u201dBelow the roller coast was a small man-made lake in an amusement park. It was a small puddle of water to add to the horror as the train plummeted down.It was as expected. Choi Inseop was looking for a box in the pool of water with his pants rolled up. His whole body trembled as if he was about to collapse.Lee Wooyeon smirked. What the hell is the need to look good to him by doing that?\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon called him, Inseop was surprised and raised his back. The wind caused him to lose his focus and fall into the puddle of water.This asshole was really different.Lee Wooyeon suppressed his irritation and made up a worried voice.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I\u2019m fine.\u201dChoi Inseop, who was about to get up, stumbled again and fell. Lee Wooyeon laughed and swallowed the swear words.\u201cWhat are you doing? In there.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I was looking. Box.\u201dThe box Choi Inseop was looking for was in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s pocket. In the car, Choi Inseop lost consciousness and was lying down so he took it out and put it in his pocket. He saw the opportunity and decided to throw it in the trash.\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Come out. Hurry.\u201d\u201cI can find it.\u201dChoi Inseop stubbornly closed his mouth and put his hand into the puddle again.\u201cCome out. You\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Please go inside.\u201dIt didn\u2019t look good at all. Even in the dark, Choi Inseop trembled with his slender shoulders and searched through the water.\u201cMr. Inseop. It\u2019s ok, please stop.\u201dEven when he said that, Choi Inseop did not pretend to listen. So he stopped saying that. Lee Wooyeon leaned against the tree and waited for Choi Inseop to walk out on his own.However, he struggled to find the box with the hand that was not even in the water for ten minutes.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. A stone like that.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a stone, but it\u2019s important.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dLee Wooyeon took off his shoes and rolled up his pants.\u201c\u2026 !\u201dChoi Inseop opened his mouth and was surprised to see him walking into the water.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to stay until we find it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s find it together. That would be better.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it alone\u2026 \u201d\u201cI\u2019m already all wet. Let\u2019s look for it quickly. It\u2019s cold.\u201dLee Wooyeon put his hand in the water and spoke. The water was so cold that it made his bones shiver. Choi Inseop\u2019s lips were red from the cold. If he had left him like that, he would have really had to clean up the body. It was the worst scandal that he couldn\u2019t handle it.And above all, he was curious. The reason why the stupid manager bastard pretended to be his fan and did this while lying.Lee Wooyeon took advantage of Choi Inseop turning his back to look for the box, took the box out of his pocket and threw it in a suitable place. Then he tapped Choi Inseop on the shoulder and motioned for him to go near there.\u201cI\u2019m going here, you go over there.\u201d\u201cYes. All right.\u201dWhile answering, he looked at Lee Wooyeon with worried eyes.Don\u2019t worry about me, you asshole.That was what he wanted to say, but he quietly smiled.\u201cHuh!\u201dChoi Inseop, who found the box, ran to him with his eyes shining. He shouted, picking up the wet box.\u201cI found it!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHe answered, wiping the water off his hand.\u201cLet\u2019s quickly. We\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAs soon as he got out of the water, Inseop wiped the water off the box he was holding and checked the inside.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201dHe handed the box to Lee Wooyeon. Lee Wooyeon put the box in his pocket and said.\u201cThanks. Thanks to you, I found it.\u201d\u201cNo. I did not watch it well\u2026\u201dWhen he came out of the water, hiss face became even whiter. He trembled so much that people passing by looked at him. Lee Wooyeon took off the jacket he was wearing and covered his body.\u201cIt\u2019s dine\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Put it on.\u201dHe thought he would continue to refuse, so Lee Wooyeon held the jacket. Choi Inseop bowed his head and muttered a word of thanks. Lee Wooyeon wiped his feet dry and put on his shoes. Even wearing one more layer of clothes, Choi Inseop could not stop his body shaking.\u201cHey there, maybe\u2026\u201dTo make matters worse, a group of women who recognized Lee Wooyeon surrounded the two of them. Lee Wooyeon pressed the hat deeply, and pulled Choi Inseop\u2019s clothes. Choi Inseop, walking through the women, apologized, asking for forgiveness. Even at this time, the manager looking for manners was frustrating, but Lee Wooyeon walked ahead without saying a word.\u201cIsn\u2019t it Lee Wooyeon oppa?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHe lowered his voice to answer, but to no avail. The falcon-eyed women quickly surrounded him and shouted.\u201cHey! Oh my, this is the real Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cOppa. Please sign.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take a picture together. I am a fan of yours.\u201dThe women surrounded them and shouted, but Lee Wooyeon pretended not to know and walked only looking ahead. Choi Inseop could instinctively know that his mood was not too good.\u201cOppa! Hold on, oppa!\u201dA female student grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hem and pulled him away. In the meantime, a group of women from the same party surrounded Lee Wooyeon. The people who heard their screams also turned their eyes to their side wondering what was going on.\u201cWooyeon brother. I really like you.\u201d\u201cOppa, please sign.\u201dMore and more people started coming in. Choi Inseop, whose behavior and judgment skills became sluggish because of the cold, was embarrassed and did not know what to do.Lee Wooyeon suddenly grabbed his hand. Then he started walking fast. The women who were left behind continued to follow him and call him, but he never looked back.\u201cUh, there\u2026\u201dHe was going to say that the direction of the parking lot was not this way, but that way, but Lee Wooyeon strongly grabbed his hand and pulled him with his mouth shut. Because of the height difference, Inseop had to walk almost like he was running.The screaming women were startled by the cold behavior of the man they believed to be Lee Wooyeon, and followed them from a reasonable distance.Lee Wooyeon took Choi Inseop into the Ferris wheel.\u201cOh, sir. Now the deadline is over\u2026 \u201d\u201cTurn one round, please.\u201dLee Wooyeon took off the hat he was wearing and smiled. The staff recognized him and asked him to sign an autograph.\u201cJust one round. Please turn it slowly. Because I am being chased.\u201dLee Wooyeon said, pointing to the women walking towards this side from a distance. The staff laughed at his playful voice and closed the Ferris wheel door. As he moved away from the ground, Choi Inseop sighed and sat down. Lee Wooyeon also sat across from him.\u201c\u2026sorry.\u201dChoi Inseop said with blue lips like a dead person.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u201dBecause of me\u2026 this wouldn\u2019t have happened if I had kept the box well in the first place\u2026 sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon leaned against the window and looked at Choi Inseop, who was bowing his head in front of him. He could see that the apology was sincere.It\u2019s okay, Lee Wooyeon just turned his head. For some reason, he didn\u2019t feel like pretending to be nice right now.In the quiet Ferris wheel, the sound of Choi Inseop\u2019s teeth chattering was particularly loud.\u201cCold?\u201dSeeing Choi Inseop trembling, he asked.\u201c\u2026 Yes. A little.\u201d\u201cCome sit by my side.\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed to the seat next to him. However, Choi Inseop only shook his head and did not move.\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you want to come by my side?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 no.\u201dInseop, who was shaking slightly, had no choice but to approach Lee Wooyeon and sit down. Just by feeling his warm body, he felt guilty. According to what he believed, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body had to be cold\u00a0 with no warm blood flowing. However, in this narrow space right now, it was impossible to avoid Lee Wooyeon openly. Thinking that a fan or an ordinary manager would do something like this, he gave justification to his actions.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIn the appearance of Choi Inseop shivering from the cold, Lee Wooyeon thought of a wet puppy. It wasn\u2019t a cute puppy that had gained weight, it was a pup that was skinny and somehow encouraged people\u2019s cruel instincts.Lee Wooyeon smiled at Choi Inseop, who was looking up at him with frightened eyes.\u201cWhy did you become my fan?\u201d\u201cYes? Oh, watching a movie\u2026 \u201dChoi Inseop was perplexed. He had imagined that he would be asked about this, but he never dreamed that the person in question would be Lee Wooyeon himself.\u201cHow was the movie?\u201d\u201cIt was good.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dIt was a question that felt somewhat obsessive. Choi Inseop responded calmly, pressing his fingertips with his fingernails.\u201cEyes looking at the sea\u2026, I liked your expression\u2026 It felt like you were lonely, so\u2026 I thought it was good.\u201dThat was true. To find out about the actor Lee Wooyeon, he watched the movie he appeared in dozens of times. The most watched work was his first independent film.Starting with throwing the woman he loved into the sea, the entire movie was shot with the beach in the background. It was a work that was praised for its excellent acting on the sadness that was buried in small and ordinary daily life. Most of all, Choi Inseop did not forget the last scene of the movie.The face of Lee Wooyeon, who looked at the sea alone without saying a word, was terribly silent. He had a face that was completely alone, as if all humans had disappeared and he was left alone on Earth.A person who is completely alone. He didn\u2019t know if that was the right expression, but every time he saw Lee Wooyeon, the words came to mind.\u201cI was going to tell you before but I couldn\u2019t.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s friendly voice brought him back to reality.\u201cWhich day are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIt was the day we ate together.\u201dChoi Inseop nodded his head. That day, Lee Wooyeon was going to say something to him, but he remembered that he left because of the chef\u2019s food.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of fans who like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dHis mouth seemed dry as he answered. Choi Inseop diligently pretended to be a fan, but worried that his attitude was lacking.\u201cActually, I have a hard time dealing with people who like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Okay.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what part of me they like, and I wonder if that\u2019s the truth. Of course, I am always grateful to the fans who like and support me.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s words were not as sincere as he tried to make it. He was annoyed by his fans. He didn\u2019t like the people who ran rudely on the road, and he hated the young women who screamed without shame. For him, fans were just a means to prove his position.\u201cThat\u2019s right. If this person likes me, I am more concerned about my actions, and I am worried that they will be disappointed.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dAlthough he was answering thoroughly, Choi Inseop could not understand why Lee Wooyeon was saying these things to him\u2026 Maybe he was saying that he was annoyed by him because he was a fan.Choi Inseop, unexpectedly, thought that he should go home and write down the fact that he could be good at acting tonight.\u201cMr. Inseop, do you like me? Or do you like my work?\u201dIn response to the unexpected question, he widened his eyes and looked at the man sitting next to him. Thanks to this, the defenseless expression was clearly revealed.\u201cI want to know which one it is.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I am\u2026\u201dA big bang occurred in his small head.Would it be better to say that he liked him, or would it be better to just say that he liked his work? Even so, if he says that he didn\u2019t like him and he only liked the work, wasn\u2019t it a bit wrong? But, obviously, Lee Wooyeon said to him that it would be a bit uncomfortable if someone liked him. Worries about which side would be helpful for future work filled Choi Inseop\u2019s head.\u201cI am\u2026\u00a0 a fan of Lee Wooyeon as an actor.\u201dTo be honest, it was close to an anti disguised as Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fan, but for now, it was best to say that.\u201cSo I wanted to help you out so that you could do better, and now\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201dFor today, Inseop practiced a lot while looking in the mirror. It was more difficult than expected for him to deceive someone, who had never lied to anyone. But he had to.\u201cA fan of Lee Wooyeon as an actor?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Choi Inseop\u2019s unhesitating answer, Lee Wooyeon burst out laughing. Inseop looked at him blankly as he tilted his head back and smiled.Maybe he said the wrong answer?\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate.\u201d\u201c\u2026 !\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad, because I thought it could be burdensome for Mr. Inseop to expect too much from me.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed his hand on Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder. It was a natural attitude. It was a hand that maintained a moderate crush and distance.\u201cLet\u2019s do a good job from now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s palm lightly patted his back. An unknown sensation ran through his back. He tried not to do that, but he trembled without realizing it.A strange smile appeared on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face when he saw it.\u201cCold?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dHi body had warmed up a lot more than before and it wasn\u2019t that cold, but Inseop had no excuses other than those words.\u201cA little bit more. Closer.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dLee Wooyeon watched the other person\u2019s expression harden whenever their shoulders touched. Choi Inseop didn\u2019t know what to do when he felt the gaze, so he turned his head out the window.It was clear he didn\u2019t like it.Lee Wooyeon raised his chin and raised the tip of his lips while looking at Choi Inseop. It wasn\u2019t pleasant to see the bewildered look of the manager whose plans he did not know, but it made him curious.Why the hell was this bastard so clumsy and trying to trick him?He thought he\u2019d put it aside for a bit. It didn\u2019t matter. No one gets tired of something as easily as him, so if he gets tired of it, he\u2019ll cut it off.Inside the narrow Ferris wheel, the two looked at the distant light, immersed in different thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s not allowed.\u201dCEO Kim Hakseung, who was lying face down, said firmly.\u201cWhy?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was lying face down on the bed far away next to him, asked.\u201cThey take guests in and blatantly ask questions. You have a charm that is mysterious, what are you going to talk about there!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay to say it in moderation?\u201d\u201cSpeaking in moderation, what\u2026!\u201dCEO Kim, who had spoken, saw Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, who was rubbing his eyes in front of him, and bit his lip.Lee Wooyeon was like a jerk. He could say that he was a natural actor at how well he hid his temper. However, Manager Cha and CEO Kim suffered from an ominous feeling that one day he would not be able to overcome his ugly temper and destroy his image.\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s not okay. Is there anything else?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have to go to a show program.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that it\u2019s common courtesy to go for interviews when doing a movie or drama?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to do a few more interviews.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t work. Even the PD called yesterday to ask you to do some PR as much as possible. Right? Inseop-ah.\u201d\u201cYes. I got a call yesterday.\u201dChoi Inseop, who was sitting across from him, answered.\u201cSince it\u2019s a historical drama, it requires a lot of investment. Of course, they want us to do PR. Of course, he paid for it. Wouldn\u2019t you do that if you were the CEO?\u201dManager Cha, who was receiving a foot massage next to him, also helped out.\u201cWhy are you following me all the way here?\u201d\u201cI also worked hard, but how can I see only the two of you getting a massage?\u201dThere were three joys in Kim\u2019s life.Fashion, fishing, and massage.Manager Cha caught CEO Kim humming and quietly trying to take Lee Wooyeon with him to the high-end massage parlour that was not available without a reservation a month in advance. He insisted that he would take him, even if no one else knew it. He was having a public meeting with Lee Wooyeon, so even though he shouted for him to leave, Manager Cha did not budge. Because the only place that CEO Kim hummed was when he bought clothes, went fishing, or got a massage.In the end, the four men were given a massage in the same room next to each other. Inseop insisted that he would not receive a full body massage even if he died, so he was sitting next to manager Cha and only receiving a foot massage.\u201cAren\u2019t there any good talk shows?\u201d\u201cLee Wooyeon is not a talk show person. CEO.\u201dDirector Cha, who knows his true nature, carefully expressed his opinion.\u201cWell. So what would be good? What do you think, Mr. Inseop?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon\u2019s looked up at him, Choi Inseop jumped up and answered.\u201cI agree with Mr. Cha\u2019s opinion.\u201d\u201cAre you in a class meeting?\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s face turned red when CEO Kim joked. As his face turned red, the freckles from the bridge of his nose stood out, making him look much younger. Lee Wooyeon noticed that recently. He sometimes looked forward to CEO Kim\u2019s jokes.\u201cThat, I mean, I think.\u201dChoi Inseop pulled out a notebook from his pocket. He turned over a few sheets of paper and spoke calmly.\u201cThere is a program called \u201cFollow the path of history\u201d by K headquarters. It proceeds like a documentary, but it is a program that deals with people who are important in history. Usually the voice actors narrate, but often the actors also narrate. I heard that they are preparing content related to the era Lee Wooyeon is acting in. If Lee Wooyeon narrates, I think he will probably make the content great. That is all.\u201dChoi Inseop put the notebook back into his pocket. All three of them smiled and looked at each other\u2019s faces.\u201cInseop. When do you go to sleep?\u201d\u201cYes? I sleep at night.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha. You really hit the goal.\u201dCEO Kim laughed like crazy. Choi Inseop realized that he had made another mistake and bowed his head. Although he learned from his father and can use Korean as his native language, he still lacked understanding on the usage of rhetorical questions. In other words, it was difficult to distinguish whether he was actually asking a question out of curiosity or using the rhetorical question form with a different intention.\u201cWhen, I mean, \u2026 When do I go to bed, did you ask this?\u201dOnly then did he understand the intention of the question asked by CEO Kim.\u201cOkay. It would be really difficult for you to follow Lee Wooyeon all day long, but why are you doing such an investigation?\u201d\u201cHe does a great job.\u201dA gentle compliment was added. Like a low class person, who received praise from a very high person, at the words of Lee Wooyeon, Choi Inseop did not know where to put himself.\u201cI will obey my manager.\u201dHearing Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, manager Cha blew a whistle. Although Lee Wooyeon was polite to the managers, it was unimaginable to follow their opinions.\u2018I don\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s thinking\u2019, thought Cha. On that day too, an emergency call came and he had business to do in the local area. He was prepared to get ten speeding tickets and went to the amusement park where he frantically ran. The two were riding on the Ferris train, soaking wet. With Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice saying it was the third lap, the manager Cha suddenly thought of what kind of work this bastard was doing.Later, he asked Choi Inseop what had happened, but he kept his mouth shut and only shook his head. Since Lee Wooyeon, who was like a goblin, had no way to say anything, the manager decided to just quietly pass the day\u2019s work.\u201cBecause Inseop is my fan, he understands me better than anyone else. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes, \u2026 Thank you for looking at me that way.\u201dIt was a fact that everyone in the office knew that he was a fan of Wooyeon. The report that he submitted along with his resume became a hot topic later, and everyone read it at least once.\u201cI\u2019m really glad that someone like Inseop is my manager.\u201dManager Cha looked at Lee Wooyeon, who said that with his eyes closed, as if he was being absurd.\u2018Am I crazy? What\u2019s wrong with him? He is not that kind of person\u2026\u2019Manager Cha realized that CEO Kim was also making the same expression as him.\u201cHey. Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cYes. CEO.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you harassing Inseop?\u201d\u201cNo. CEO!\u201dThe answer came out of Choi Inseop\u2019s mouth, not Lee Wooyeon. Lee Wooyeon let out a pleasant laugh.\u201cTell me who I am bullying. You joke too much, CEO. Hahaha.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t talk.\u201dCEO Kim nodded and turned his head in pain.\u201cAre there any uncomfortable places?\u201d\u201cYes Yes. It\u2019s fine.\u201dChoi Inseop responded with extreme respect to the masseuse who was massaging his feet.\u201cThen we will finish it.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dHe said he would wait in the car, but was dragged by manager Cha to receive a massage, but Inseop was burdened with all of this.\u201cInseop, why are you having such a hard time? It\u2019s okay. When would you ever get a service from that frugal CEO?\u201dManager Cha muttered as he leaned deep into the leather chair.\u201cI don\u2019t know about manager Cha, but Inseop deserves service. He was a beginner, so I entrusted him to Lee Wooyeon, just in case, but who knew that he would do such a good job.\u201d\u201cJust in case? Ha ha ha, CEO. You\u2019re too much. Did you choose my manager with that in mind?\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s joke, CEO Kim rolled his eyes and glared at him.\u2018How can you say that. This motherfucker. Do you know how hard it is for me to choose your managers! It was so hard I vomited blood! You bastard!\u2019\u2026 CEO Kim\u2019s heart, who could not shout, burned black.If possible, he wanted to pluck out the root of that evil tongue of Lee Wooyeon. However, since he knows better than anyone how wonderful the effect of that tongue is, he endured it with only his fists clenched.\u201cSo, that\u2019s why he had to choose well. Isn\u2019t it?\u201dAt the words of Manager Cha, CEO Kim said, \u201cOf course,\u201d and nodded.\u201cYou picked well. Very well chosen. So, Lee Wooyeon, you\u2026 do well.\u201dWhile passing through the many words he wanted to say, CEO Kim glared at Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI am doing well. Because Inseop did a good job.\u201dChoi Inseop, who was sitting alone in the chair after receiving the foot massage, only glanced at the direction in which Lee Wooyeon was lying with anxious eyes.Manager Cha tilted his head. Often strange thoughts ran through his head. The new manager, who claimed to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fan, looked nervous to the point that he sometimes felt like he was going too far\u2026\u00a0he felt somewhat scared to say that it was because he was a fan.No way. Lee Wooyeon, that pretentious little bastard, must have shown his personality to a newcomer.Manager Cha pushed the thoughts out of his head and closed his eyes.\u201cManager Cha. Did you forget we\u2019re going fishing this weekend?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely. Let\u2019s go this time. I\u2019m going to show you the skills I\u2019ve been honing for this week.\u201d\u201cAre you two going fishing again?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon asked, CEO Kim shouted, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s good to see you two because you get along really well.\u201d\u201cWho else would go fishing with our him. He\u2019s a complete cheater.\u201d\u201cWhy am I a cheater? Why did you take advantage of my bait while I was sleeping while fishing last time?\u201d\u201cI only checked it because it moved for a moment. Seriously, have you been deceived? You don\u2019t really believe what people say.\u201d\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s face each other fairly this time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear that.\u201dChoi Inseop looked at the two of them like little children, giving and receiving. According to the information that he knew, in Korea, the hierarchy in the workplace is certain, because the two looked like old friends.\u201cAre you two close?\u201dInseop, without realizing it, asked. Then he covered his mouth with the palm of his hand and bowed his head to apologize.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry about. Manager Cha served as a road manager for me when I was a model.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. At the time, he was only a road manager. You\u2019ve grown a lot, Manager Cha.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not only you who has come far. Who would have known that a wealthy man who worked as a model as a hobby would become a president of an agency.\u201dChoi Inseop burst into laughter at the conversation between the two people who were fighting each other. He imagined the two of them when they were young.\u201c\u2026what. So you can laugh too.\u201dManager Cha muttered as if surprised to see Inseop like that.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t laugh at all. I thought you were the kind of person who didn\u2019t smile well.\u201d\u201c\u2026 sorry.\u201dCome to think of it, he couldn\u2019t remember smiling properly after coming to Korea. It was correct to say that he couldn\u2019t afford it. CEO Kim, who saw Choi Inseop scratching his head, remembered something and opened his mouth.\u201cWhat are you doing this weekend? Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThis weekend. Lee Wooyeon, are you off?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m resting.\u201dIt was the last week for Lee Wooyeon, who would start filming the drama next week.\u201cDoes Inseop have any plans for the weekend?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I don\u2019t.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know anyone in Korea, and there wasn\u2019t much to do. This weekend, he was about to read the original story of the drama that Lee Wooyeon started, and was thinking of making his own plans according to the schedule for next week.\u201cIf Inseop doesn\u2019t have a job then, would you like to go fishing in the East Sea with us?\u201d\u201cFishing?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t tried winter fishing, have you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I haven\u2019t done any fishing.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. It will be fun.\u201d\u201cYes. Come with us. The only thing the CEO has is money, he has a boat and a villa, so you can come barefoot. Of course I\u2019ll give you some rice. Because the CEO cooks spicy fish stew so well. Of course, I will buy you sashimi.\u201d\u201cGreat. If it\u2019s Inseop, I\u2019ll go all out. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cNo, I just\u2026 \u201dChoi Inseop was going to say no.This was a place where he wanted to stay quietly and leave. He didn\u2019t want to create any kind of relationship here. In particular, if he later caught Lee Wooyeon\u2019s weakness, they were the people who would suffer the most, except for him.\u201cIt must be fun.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who had not said anything until then, intervened.\u201cOf course. It\u2019s fun. No way\u2026 you want to come?\u201dCEO Kim asked, carefully examining Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes. No way, he thought. From his smile, CEO Kim was able to grasp the exact meaning behind it.\u2018Am I crazy? Why would I go there?\u2019CEO Kim thought the same. Why would he go there?If Lee Wooyeon was taken on a trip, it was no longer a trip.Manager Cha muttered a little saying why was he here.\u201cAnyway, will Inseop come?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just stay home.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing at home?You said you live alone. What are you going to do alone on the weekend? Do you have a girlfriend?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. It will be fun.\u201dEven Manager Cha encouraged him. With no way out, Choi Inseop began to grumble, wondering what to do.\u201cWhy are you forcing yourself with people you don\u2019t like?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate it.\u201d\u201cOf course you don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s hard to rest on weekends, and if you start filming, you won\u2019t be able to sleep well for the time being. He doesn\u2019t want to, but how can he say no to that? The CEO is sometimes too kind. Ha ha.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and took the manager\u2019s side. However, if they listened closely, it seemed like it was words that criticized both CEO Kim and Inseop.\u201cOh, I think it\u2019s a little bit like that. If Inseop is tired, just rest.\u201d\u201cNo. CEO. It\u2019s not that I hate it.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think about it.\u201dSeeing CEO Kim\u2019s shy smile, Choi Inseop felt sorry.He did not intentionally come to Korea to make friends. He only treated the office people in a clerical tone, and even on days off, he did not leave the house and spent all his alone time. Sometimes contacting his family was all he did in his personal time.\u2018Aren\u2019t you lonely?\u2019It was lonely. It was lonely to the bone. He was so lonely that he did not contact his family often to intentionally poison his heart.Sometimes he wanted to go out, watch a movie, eat his favorite food, and get some fresh air. He also wanted to try winter fishing. He also wanted to taste the spicy maeuntang, which he had only read in books, and which CEO Kim cooks so well.\u201cNo. The president\u2019s thoughts are not shortsighted. Just I\u2026 just\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop was speechless. He didn\u2019t know what to say. He had never imagined a time like this. He has imagined countless times while lying in bed when he was sick, to travel all over the world looking at travel books, to become the best basketball player in the world, to become a competent doctor and to heal patients, but his boss invited him to a weekend trip. A scene he had never imagined.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Inseop. I shouldn\u2019t have said that. It\u2019s a boring trip for the elderly.\u201dManager Cha also scratched his head.Thanks to this, the apologetic feeling doubled.\u201cNo. I think it will be a fun trip. I think it\u2019s sure to be a fun trip for older people.\u201dCEO Kim frowned saying he used the wrong definition, but Inseop was diligently ignoring that part.\u201cI think it will be a very interesting trip. I think so too. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to follow the old people because I think it\u2019s a boring trip, I just\u2026 I am\u2026I will go.\u201d\u201cGreat. Is it okay? You don\u2019t have to force yourself to come.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a compulsion. I will go.\u201dChoi Inseop answered with a determined face. CEO Kim was like a benefactor who hired him. Manager Cha was also a person who took care of him several times more than other people. Although there were times when they patted his shoulders with a pitiful expression on their face, he was most grateful to the two he met in Korea.\u201cI will go. For fishing.\u201d\u201cReally? You aren\u2019t forcing yourself?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not. I will go with a happy heart.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop bowed his head and said that, Manager Cha burst into laughter. He said, making Inseop\u2019s shoulders straight with his palms.\u201cI mean, Mr. Inseop speaks very strangely when I see him sometimes. What should I say? Sometimes\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he like a waiter?\u201dAt the words of Lee Wooyeon, who was lying face down, CEO Kim and manager Cha laughed at the words.\u201cPuhahahaha. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cRight, that\u2019s it. Where the hell did you learn to speak like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Am I speaking like that?\u201dChoi Inseop had the knowledge that he should talk politely to a boss at work. After going home tonight, he decided he had to find out right away what a waiter talked like.\u201cIf you have time on the weekend, then you can come, and if you think it is unreasonable, you don\u2019t have to. Oh wait.\u201dThen, Kim\u2019s cell phone rang. Manager Cha handed the cell phone to him.\u201cHello. yes, ah, yes Okay. I will be there soon.\u201dAfter the call, CEO Kim stood up from his seat. He motioned for manager Cha to stand up.\u201cManager Cha. Let\u2019s go. Take me there.\u201d\u201cGo alone. I\u2019m going to get some more.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that I drank wine earlier? Drive me there quickly.\u201d\u201cAh, then call the deputy!\u201d\u201cHow can I leave my car to him? That expensive car!\u201dManager Cha muttered and stood up from his seat. When Choi Inseop tried to stand up together to see off, CEO Kim shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Take it easy. Just go.\u201d\u201c\u2026 thank you.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll see you on the weekend, Lee Wooyeon, you on the weekend\u2026 rest.\u201dCEO Kim smiled awkwardly and patted Wooyeon on the shoulder. Wooyeon said he\u2019ll think about it.When the two left, only Lee Wooyeon and Choi Inseop, a chiropractor who was holding his shoulder, remained in the room. After a while, the chiropractor who finished the massage asked Lee Wooyeon in a quiet voice.\u201cAre there any uncomfortable places?\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen we will finish it.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLee Wooyeon got up. His upper body, tightened with muscles, was exposed. Seeing his broad shoulders, Inseop remembered the broad-shouldered hymn he had made with Jenny. Jenny especially liked the prince\u2019s broad shoulders. She insisted that the splendor of the song should be handed down from generation to generation. Jenny liked to write poetry and make songs. He always wrote works for the prince with her. Of course, the work was never delivered.Quarterback shoulder.Jenny always called the prince\u2019s shoulder that way.\u201cWhy? Is there something on me?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was wearing a gown, felt his gaze and asked.\u201cNo.\u201dChoi Inseop quickly turned his head. It looked like he was looking at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder, unintentionally. His heart was pounding. His heart was beating wildly with just one fragment of the memory he had for a while.Inseop pressed his chest with his hands and tried to regain his composure.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go out first and wait.\u201dChoi Inseop stood up from his seat. Perhaps it was not an exaggeration to say that a foot massage alone would relieve tiredness, but the steps were certainly lighter than before.They say this was Korea\u2019s mysterious Qi treatment.Growing up with a Korean adoptive father, he was able to use Korean as his mother tongue, but in terms of culture, it was mostly new to him. He didn\u2019t say anything, but for Choi Inseop, every day was a series of new things.When he got home and was organizing his new notes in his notebook, someone tapped him on the shoulder. When he turned around, he saw a strangely familiar woman smiling brightly.\u201cHello.\u201dChoi Inseop bowed his head and said hello. Even if he didn\u2019t know her, if she knew him, it was highly likely that she was a person related to work.\u201cAren\u2019t yout Mr. Wooyeon\u2019s manager?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you remember me?\u201dWhile Choi Inseop was thinking back on his memories, the woman looked up and down with a strange smile on her face.\u201cI do remember that day quite clearly.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s expression hardened. It was the woman he had seen at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house a while back. At that time, he was all naked in the shower, so he couldn\u2019t see the other person closely, but the overall impression was memorable.\u201cWhere is he? Did you come with him?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dHe was conflicted. Looking at the atmosphere that day, it didn\u2019t seem like she broke up with Lee Wooyeon well, but he wasn\u2019t sure if it was okay to say that he would come out after a while.\u201cDidn\u2019t you come here with Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cWe came together.\u201d\u201cThen where is he?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dChoi Inseop, who was silent for a moment, said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and bowed his head.\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d\u201cI have nothing to tell you.\u201dYu Minju\u2019s smiling face turned red. It was only now that she understood what the manager was talking about.\u201cHey. Do you know who I am now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI am Yu Minju. You don\u2019t know Minju?\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dChoi Inseop just repeated the same words. Yu Minju, angry with his stubborn posture, started yelling at the him.\u201cHey, are you crazy? What the hell are you doing right now, manager!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere is Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cAre you kidding me? This kid.\u201dFor a moment, his eyes flashed. Choi Inseop, embarrassed by the dizzy and tingling sensation, did not even realize that he had been hit in the face.\u201cYou bastard, how cocky.\u201dYoo Minju slapped Choi Inseop\u2019s cheek with the palm of her hand one after another. The people at the counter ran towards them, but they did not try to stop her.This was because even here, she was already rumored to have a dirty personality, so it was difficult to defend someone from her since they were not powerful.\u201cThis kid. Do you not have a mouth? A bastard like you dares to talk to me like that\u2026 !\u201dSomeone grabbed her hand from behind.\u201cHuh\u2026 Mr. Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice was exceptionally low. Choi Inseop just stood there with his head bowed.\u201cNo, I\u2019m telling him\u2026 \u201d\u201cHe\u2019s my manager.\u201d\u201cYeah, so I\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed bitterly. He put his face to Yu Minju\u2019s ear and whispered softly.\u201cIf you do this right now,\u00a0 your image will be ruined, Minju.\u201d\u201cI mean\u2026Wooyeon contacted me\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon gave strength to the hand that was holding her wrist. Yu Minju said, \u201cOuch,\u201d and screamed a little.\u201cYou must have been drinking. I will help you.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026 Aww, put your hands down, Mr. Wooyeon\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon gestured to the employee who was looking at them from the counter. The staff came running.\u201cI think Minju was very drunk. So, I\u2019m requesting you.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. All right.\u201d\u201cGet her home, and pretend you didn\u2019t see what happened today. Please.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s polite request, the employee blushed and replied that he would of course do so. Most of the shops used by celebrities were strictly confidential, but words were bound to leak out somehow.Thinking that Yu Minju was enough to be swept away by bad rumors, Lee Wooyeon passed the woman over to the staff.\u201cMr. Wooyeon, please tell me\u2026 \u201dLooking at her, who didn\u2019t even think about keeping her mouth shut, Lee Wooyeon made a slight face. He was the idiot who didn\u2019t recognize that fucking bitch from the start.\u201cGo in. Please.\u201dLee Wooyeon tapped the esthetician\u2019s shoulder and made a glance to take her out immediately. Until she left the door, Minju shrieked angrily. After confirming that the elevator was going down, Choi Inseop raised his head.\u201cSorry. It is my negligence.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dLee Wooyeon took a handkerchief from his pocket and placed it on Choi Inseop\u2019s nose. Not only was his cheek red and swollen from how much he had been hit, but blood was flowing from one side of his nose.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you go to the hospital?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cSorry. Because of me.\u201dLee Wooyeon looked at Choi Inseop\u2019s face and continued speaking.\u201cYou won\u2019t bruise, but \u2026There is a wound here.\u201dRecalling Yu Minju\u2019s hand that was wearing a large diamond ring, Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue.\u201cYou just have to apply the medicine. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cGo to the car. I will apply it.\u201d\u201cNo, I will do it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Okay. Don\u2019t be stubborn.\u201dLee Wooyeon took Choi Inseop\u2019s hand and dragged him to the front of the elevator. Of course, he did not forget to greet the staff kindly as he left the door.Lee Wooyeon, who took Choi Inseop to the Benz, sat him in the back seat.\u201cWhere is the medicine box\u2026\u00a0 ah, here it is.\u201dHe brought the medicine box and sat right in front of Choi Inseop. Choi Inseop couldn\u2019t even raise his head, and only held down his fingers.\u201cLook up.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t turn your head, I can\u2019t apply the medicine.\u201d\u201c\u2026I-\u201dLee Wooyeon forced him to raise his head by sticking his finger under his chin. The two\u2019s eyes met.Lee Wooyeon squeezed the ointment on the tip of his finger and rubbed it against Inseop\u2019s wounded cheek. The touch of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s beautiful fingers was transmitted to him through pain.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat woman, I think she was looking for me. You just had to say I was coming out soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I thought you would hate it.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed. What the hell is with this idiot?\u201cAre you going to avoid doing what I don\u2019t like even if you die?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0 maybe.\u201d\u201caybe?\u201d\u201cI will not do it.\u201dA childlike reply came back, vowing to do good. Lee Wooyeon said in a voice mixed with laughter. He felt like he had a dog that listened well. It was interesting to see his small body trembling in fear while pretending to wag his tail vigorously. The problem was that, as always, Lee Wooyeon hated puppies.\u201cYou are very loyal. Our manager.\u201dLee Wooyeon joked, took out a band-aid and put it on Inseop\u2019s face.\u201cIf I tell you to die, you will die.\u201dLee Wooyeon said so while looking at his swollen face. After hesitating for a while, Choi Inseop replied, \u201cI will.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you tell me to die, I\u2019ll die.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cI will do that. I don\u2019t know if that will happen though.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who had been dazed, burst into laughter. It had been a long time. It was not like how he faked his laugh, but he actually laughed out loud.Lee Wooyeon really wanted to ask.\u2018What the hell are you thinking doing this?\u2019\u201cWhy would I ask you to die, don\u2019t you even know how to joke?\u201dHe lightly tapped Choi Inseop\u2019s cheek with his palm. He thought about Choi Inseop\u2019s real age, written on his resume, at the touch of his cheeks as soft as a child\u2019s skin. Did he say twenty-six? Hopefully, he was not a minor.\u201cAh\u2026 Yes. It\u2019s a joke. I-\u201dChoi Inseop quickly responded to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words. Seeing his awkward smile, Lee Wooyeon suddenly had a whim.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dChoi Inseop, who was organizing the medicine box, turned his head.\u201cIs the East Sea the place you are going for fishing on the weekend?\u201dWith a languid and lovely smile like a cat on a spring day, Lee Wooyeon asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Love History Caused by Willful NegligenceCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201c\u2026 So, you came here just to refresh your mind before starting the drama?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWinter fishing the day before filming?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u00a0 Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201dCEO Kim laughed with a bewildered expression on his face. His chin hardened.That wasn\u2019t it, it was not that.No matter how good he tried, that was not the case!Manager Cha, who was leaving with a fishing rod, also found Lee Wooyeon standing in front of the car, and his expression hardened. He quickly noticed CEO Kim, but was unable to say anything.\u201cWhen I saw Manager Cha and CEO Kim, I also had a lot of thoughts. I really admire the two of you working together for such a long time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 okay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to do some benchmarking while watching.\u201dBenchmarking? Bullshit. But CEO Kim smiled brightly as he struggled to hold back his from yelling what he wanted to say.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why you came. here? You must be tired because you\u2019re filming a drama next week, huh?\u201dLee Wooyeon responded innocently to the meaningful words thrown by CEO Kim, biting his teeth tightly and smiling.\u201cYou know my stamina very well. Well, who cares?\u201dOne of the reasons that directors and PDs liked Lee Wooyeon was his tireless physical strength. No matter how good someone\u2019s physical strength is, if they miss three days of sleep, they will always show signs of tiredness, but Lee Wooyeon was always fresh. There was even gossip about whether he was taking any kind of medicine. To those who asked what the secret to maintaining stamina was, Lee Wooyeon only gave the old-fashioned answer, \u201cIt\u2019s exercise.\u201d\u201cYeah \u2026You are in good shape.\u201d\u201cYou told me to be friendly with the manager. Why?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to be close \u2026 \u201dManager Cha gave a sharp look to the side of CEO Kim as he was about to speak. It was because Choi Inseop was standing next to him with a bag.\u201c\u2026Ha ha ha ha ha. Of course you should be friendly. Just like me and the Manager Cha.\u201dCEO Kim said, putting his hand on the shoulder of Manager Cha. Manager Cha smiled and dropped CEO Kim\u2019s arm.\u201cWho\u2019s driving the car?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked. Choi Inseop, who was holding the bag, raised his hand suddenly and shouted.\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201dAll three of them couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his outrageous cry.\u201cInseop. Do you have trauma because you couldn\u2019t give a presentation during the class meeting? You can put your hands down.\u201d\u201cHe has a secret desire to present. Mr. Inseop.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s face turned red as he lowered his hand.\u201cI\u2019ll do the driving. Give me the key.\u201dWhen manager Cha gestured, CEO Kim took the key out of his pocket and threw it.\u201cIt\u2019s a new car, so drive gently.\u201d\u201cThen you can take the company car.\u201d\u201cThe Benz stands out too much. I don\u2019t like people snooping around thinking it\u2019s celebrities.\u201d\u201c\u2026 If you\u2019re just trying to play quietly and comfortably, it\u2019s already too late.\u201dManager Cha grumbled as he glanced at Lee Wooyeon. A quiet fishing trip was already ruined because of Lee Wooyeon. If he could only fish at night in a rare place, he had no choice but to lock himself up in the villa during the day.As the manager sat in the driver\u2019s seat, Choi Inseop naturally climbed into the passenger seat. Seeing the opportunity, he was thinking of taking over the steering wheel.CEO Kim sat in the back seat, the best seat, naturally, and Wooyeon took the seat next to him.No one spoke until the car drove through the city. After driving for about ten minutes on the highway, CEO Kim glanced back and said:\u201cIs there a car behind us?\u201d\u201cTwo. A white car and a gray taxi.\u201dManager Cha skillfully turned the steering wheel and answered.\u201c\u2026 is that so?\u201dChoi Inseop turned his body back to check, but he couldn\u2019t tell which vehicle they were talking about.\u201cA fan or a journalist. It must be one of the two.\u201dLee Wooyeon said as if it was insignificant. CEO Kim said, \u201cHeh, heh,\u201d and grabbed his shoulder.\u201cDidn\u2019t you just get away from it?\u201d\u201cThe CEO knows better how persistent these people are.\u201d\u201cNo matter what, would we want to play with such crap around us, right?\u201dManager Cha glanced behind him and asked if he should get rid of them.\u201cGet away.\u201dWhen CEO Kim\u2019s permission fell, the engine accelerated with a boom. As the speed suddenly increased, Inseop, who was sitting in the front seat, gasped, and grabbed the handle.\u201cDo not worry. It\u2019s manager Cha, he\u2019s good at driving.\u201dCEO Kim spoke slowly from behind, but Inseop could hardly let go of the handle because the speed he felt in front of him was enormous.Manager Cha casually changed lanes and overtook the car in front, increasing the speed gradually.\u201cUwahhh.\u201dAs he narrowly passed the car in front, Choi Inseop\u2019s face turned white and he screamed. Lee Wooyeon, who was reading the script from behind, grinned at the sound.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He is a man with a personal taxi license because he has been driving without an accident for 20 years.\u201dChoi Inseop, who was blind to Korea\u2019s jokes, could not read between the lines. While he was holding the handle tightly, he shook his head hard and spoke to manager Cha.\u201cYou even got a personal taxi license while being busy, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why did I take it?\u201d\u201cThe representative\u2026 No. Guess there was a mistake\u2026\u00a0 Ahh.\u201dOnce again, the car swerved sideways. He couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. Choi Inseop took the medicine from his pocket and put it in his mouth and began to chew.\u201cWhat drug? Do you take motion sickness medicine?\u201dIt was a heart medicine with a tranquilizer component. Choi Inseop, on paper, was a healthy man, but he ignorantly answered.\u201cIt\u2019s a pain reliever.\u201d\u201cAre you eating it without water? Don\u2019t you need it?\u201d\u201cI ate it often so it became a habit.\u201dChoi Inseop, who had spoken up to that point, realized his mistake. The average person would not have developed the habit of chewing on a headache pill. But no one paid any attention to Inseop\u2019s words. Inseop let out a small sigh.He didn\u2019t want to show any deviation from the normal and ordinary Choi Inseop.\u201cCan you read it in a moving car?\u201dCEO Kim saw Lee Wooyeon reading the script and asked.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you dizzy? I always feel dizzy.\u201d\u201cThe CEO usually gets upset when he reads a book.\u201dManager Cha giggled and made fun of CEO Kim.\u201cWhen did I? I read a lot of books.\u201d\u201cGive me the title of a book you read recently.\u201d\u201c\u2026 hey, you\u2019re out of your mind. Close the script.\u201dCEO Kim, who\u2019s mouth twitched, quarreled with Lee Wooyeon. Lee Wooyeon said, \u201cLet me read a little more,\u201d and didn\u2019t take his eyes off the script.\u201cSpiteful bastard. You\u2019ve already read it until it became tattered. What more do you want to read?\u201dChoi Inseop recalled in an interview that Lee Wooyeon said that he reads the script until he memorizes all the other people\u2019s lines. He had a strange feeling. It was not easy to see Lee Wooyeon\u2019s attachment to something and his efforts.\u201cI have to memorize it.\u201d\u201cDo you really need to memorize other people\u2019s lines?\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed lightly without answering. Manager Cha, who was driving around and around, looked behind him and said.\u201cWe\u2019ve lost them.\u201d\u201cAs expected, Cha. He specializes in this because he has a lot of experience in getting rid of my fans. Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201d\u201cNo way. The representative\u2019s fans weren\u2019t like this. I went out with the representative holding hands.\u201d\u201cHey, this guy! What are you saying in front of the kids! Hahahaha, I never did that. Lee Wooyeon, don\u2019t play with your fans.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that \u2026 what. Does that mean I did that? I didn\u2019t do that either! Manager Cha. Say something!\u201dManager Cha blew a whistle and refused to answer. Choi Inseop looked at the two of them and smiled a little.\u201cDid Inseop laugh again?\u201dWhen CEO Kim leaned forward and asked a question, Inseop shook his head tightly.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you smiling? Don\u2019t you know that laughter brings happiness?\u201d\u201cAll things go well\u2026Is that correct? \u2026 \u2026 is not it.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s muttering voice gradually diminished because he was a little unsure of the idiom.\u201cIt\u2019s just a saying. Hahaha, I do, but sometimes when I talk to him\u2026\u201dCEO Kim, who was about to speak, looked at Lee Wooyeon for a moment and kept his mouth shut. He thought of the sense of incompatibility he often felt previously with someone when talking with Choi Inseop.Lee Wooyeon, who was born and raised abroad, had improved a lot now, but at first seemed like a foreigner who was fluent in Korean. Conversations were often cut off due to differences in cultural thinking rather than problems with pronunciation or tone. Just like right now.\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201dChoi Inseop, who was still clutching the handle by the door, asked with a scared face. CEO Kim said no.He felt sorry for Choi Inseop, because that bastard Lee Wooyeon had a disease that made him suspicious even of anyone.\u201cBut now\u2026 can we slow down a bit?\u201dChoi Inseop looked at the speedometer with worried eyes. Manager Cha tilted his head with a face asking why.\u201cDidn\u2019t you get rid of the car that was chasing us?\u201d\u201cI got rid of it.\u201d\u201cStill, you\u2019re going so fast?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a highway, so I\u2019m driving appropriately. From what Mr. Inseop is saying, you must be a gentle driver.\u201d\u201cGentle driver?\u201d\u201cWooyeon must be frustrated. When you drive, Inseop.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not that bad.\u201dThe only downside to Choi Inseop, who was perfectly adapted to his job, as if he was born to be a manager, was that he drove too slowly.\u201cBetter than the one who is rough.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll be careful and go a little faster in the future.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop criticized himself in front of him, Lee Wooyeon closed the script and said no.\u201cI hate driving that makes me uneasy. Even if it\u2019s a little frustrating, I like people who do it safely.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Rather make it frustrating. He pretended he was good at driving for nothing and in one day, Kang Taekgeun\u2026\u201dCEO Kim suddenly shut his mouth. Choi Inseop asked who it was.\u201cThe guy who got into a car accident in one day and left.\u201dCEO Cha briefly summarized the incident.A man named Kang Taekgeun, who once said he was on the car racing team, wrecked the Benz front bumper worth 100 million won and wrote his resignation in one day. The cause of the accident in the parking lot was a brake failure of an unknown reason, and CEO Kim only guessed to himself that it must have been Lee Wooyeon\u2019s work.\u201cDon\u2019t think too much, Inseop, drive safely. That will last a long time.\u201dCEO Kim gave meaningful advice and looked at Lee Wooyeon. Lee Wooyeon started reading the script again with an expression of not knowing what he was talking about.In the car, short insignificant conversations took place. Choi Inseop was able to release the handle only after manager Cha lowered the speed to 120.The car, which had been running like that for a while, fell into the Donghae rest area.\u201cWhy? Just go. It would take another forty minutes or so.\u201d\u201cMy bladder is bursting. People are not considerate.\u201dManager Cha grumbled and stopped the car in a suitable place. When Choi Inseop tried to open the car door, manager Cha grabbed his hand and blocked it.\u201cWait. You have to make sure your path is clear.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to walk around freely because of him.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. So what should I do?\u201d\u201cYou should ask him. Will you be in the car? What would you like to buy?\u201dLee Wooyeon closed the script and put on sunglasses. Seeing that he was wearing a hat with a hoodie and a jacket, CEO Kim sighed.\u201cHey, what kind of trip is this?\u201dThe three got out of the car first and Wooyeon followed. As expected, after walking a few steps, they were surrounded by a group of women who noticed Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWooyeon oppa!\u201d\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Lee Wooyeon, Lee Wooyeon!\u201dCameras were heard everywhere. The three of them managed to get through the crowds and managed to find a seat in the dining room.Lee Wooyeon was sitting in the middle of the restaurant with a face that said he didn\u2019t care about the noise around him. While Manager Cha went to the bathroom, CEO Kim returned after finishing his order.\u201cLet\u2019s just eat and go. We will eat sashimi again when we arrive anyway.\u201d\u201cManager Cha. Here.\u201dManager Cha quickly found the three people and came to their seats.\u201cI\u2019m glad no one is there. If there was a school trip anywhere, it would be really over.\u201d\u201cThis is not the season for school trips. Do you remember before? While filming in the countryside, I stopped at a rest stop, and there were twenty or several school trip vehicles standing there. Ha ha ha ha ha. At that time, there was a riot that prevented the car from starting, and you called me, Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cYes. I did.\u201dIt sounded like he was talking about a funny memory, but the anecdote contained therein was bloody.The call to Lee Wooyeon, who went out for a filming in the countryside, was suddenly cut off saying that he had to send manager Cha as he was locked up because of the stupid manager bastard. Wherever Cha went to the location, Wooyeon was in the van, and the manager was in cold sweat because he couldn\u2019t even approach the Benz. The manager, who came to the rest area where dozens of school trip vehicles were standing, said with a very loud voice in the bathroom that he was filming with Lee Wooyeon. In the end, Lee Wooyeon was trapped in the van due to the girls who went looking for him. When another school left, another school arrived, and then another arrived. It was endless repetition. Lee Wooyeon was locked in the car for about three hours, and the filming that day came to a stop.At that time, the manager was cut off by CEO Kim under pressure from Lee Wooyeon and Cha.\u201cOh, that happened. \u201dRemembering the bitter memories, CEO Kim smacked his lips. Food came out and the number of people asking for autographs decreased because the women were conscious enough to wait for the others to finish their food.\u201cAs expected, udon tastes the best at rest areas. Although it\u2019s not the same taste I had on a school trip.\u201d\u201cYes. Udon noodles are the best when eaten on school trips.\u201dManager Cha also said. Lee Wooyeon and Choi Inseop were just using their chopsticks without saying a word.\u201cCome to think of it, was Inseop from Sinseok High School? Who is it? Didn\u2019t the planning team leader say he was from there?\u201d\u201cReally? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s right. Shin Seok High School. Don\u2019t you two know?\u201d\u201cDoes the CEO know everyone who went to your school?\u201dEven if Cha rebuked him, CEO Kim remained firm.\u201cOf course. All the students in my school know me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what the CEO says. Mr. Inseop must have been kind and docile even when he was in school, but how does it compare to someone who talks like the CEO?\u201dChoi Inseop was silent and only moved his chopsticks. His school life was miserable. He was a so-called loser in school due to the tag of an Asian adopted child and was held back several times because he was not able to fulfill his attendance. He wondered how many people would remember him. There was no Jenny to remember him, so he didn\u2019t exist in anyone\u2019s memory now.\u201cWhere did you go on a school trip when you were in high school?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cSchool trip.\u201dIt seemed that the topic of the story flowed there for a while. Inseop pretended to think, \u201cWell,\u201d and then got up saying he was going to go to the bathroom. As soon as he left, CEO Kim raised his eyes and began to pester Lee Wooyeon.\u201cYou, Why did you come here?\u201d\u201cI came here to get some air.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan? You didn\u2019t follow him to bully, did you?\u201dPointing in the direction where Inseop disappeared, CEO Kim continued to interrogate:\u201cDon\u2019t do what you\u2019ve never done.\u201dWooyeon put down his chopsticks and smiled,\u201cIf you were going to be this scared, the CEO would have died of a heart attack in the past. What\u2019s wrong with you? Like an amateur.\u201dCEO Kim couldn\u2019t even laugh at the joke:\u201cDon\u2019t say nonsense. Why are you here?\u201d\u201cI came here because I was curious.\u201d\u201cWhat are you curious about? Fish? Are you here because you are wondering what kind of fish to catch?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is going on in our manager\u2019s head.\u201d\u201c\u2026what are you talking about?\u201dCEO Kim looked at manager Cha as if for help. Manager Cha shrugged lightly. If possible, he didn\u2019t want to be involved with Lee Wooyeon.\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to care more about Kang Youngmo than that now?\u201dWhen Manager Cha mentioned the name of the male actor who had been cast as a second lead actor in the same drama as Lee Wooyeon this time, CEO Kim\u2019s expression also deteriorated.Kang Youngmo, who is famous for his dirty personality, couldn\u2019t stand it when the spotlight came on other actors besides himself. He was selfish to the extent that he accompanied a writer who changed the script to suit his taste. Those that worked with him once just shook their heads when they heard his name. Still, there was only one reason why he continued to be cast. He was so good at acting that he was one of the few actors who got a decent rating just by appearing.\u201cAh. That changed to that person?\u201d\u201cIf I had known he was going to be in the movie, I wouldn\u2019t have put you in there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201c\u2026how can I not be worried?\u201dBecause of Kang Youngmo\u2019s fiery personality, he often heard rumors that he fought with not only the PD, but also the other actors, extras, and even the staff. What Kang Youngmo particularly hated was the situation in which someone else got attention. Lee Wooyeon, who was very popular, seemed to have all the conditions to become his rival.\u201cWhen he filmed the movie last time, there was an article saying that Kim Seokhyun poured alcohol into his head and clenched his fists.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also been corrected that it\u2019s not true. The two of them are friendly and shoulder-to-shoulder.\u201d\u201cThen, before the movie was released, would the film company just let such an article go? It\u2019s just that he gave reporters money and fed them alcohol. Kim Seokhyun is a kind kid, so even after fighting, he just put up with it for the film, but what are you going to do?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled brightly,\u201cI don\u2019t do that.\u201dWhen a passerby greeted Lee Woo-yeon, he smiled kindly and bowed his head. In that state, he whispered softly.\u201cI\u2019ll kill him when no one\u2019s watching.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cHahahaha. It\u2019s a joke, a joke.\u201dLee Wooyeon waved his hand cheerfully, but they both knew that what he had just said wasn\u2019t just a joke:\u201cWhat, I\u2019m nice too.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 .\u201dFans often called Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smile a murder smile because of his eyes that bend like a crescent moon when he smiled. CEO Kim and Cha also agreed to the name. If Lee Wooyeon laughed like that, he had a murderous intend.\u201cCan\u2019t you ask the director?\u201dWhen Manager Cha expressed his opinion, CEO Kim jumped:\u201cAre you crazy? I did all the commercials now and even had a production presentation, but if I asked that, what kind of article would come out?\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s right. But\u2026\u201dManager Cha\u2019s melancholy gaze reached Lee Wooyeon, who was eating udon with a face that had no place in the world.\u201cBut, wouldn\u2019t that be better than being a murderer?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201c\u2026Why is the CEO raising a child like that\u2026\u201dWhile the concerns of the two were ripening, Lee Wooyeon finished eating peacefully.\u201cShould we go?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Why isn\u2019t Inseop coming out?\u201d\u201cI guess he\u2019s doing his business.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take him to the car. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to eat the udon anyway, because he was about to go to the bathroom. Please give me the key.\u201dManager Cha took the car key out of his pocket and handed it to him. As Lee Wooyeon stood up, several women who were watching him from the corner rushed in with their cameras. Lee Wooyeon steered through the crowd with a modest smile, rejecting them. Seeing this, Manager Cha took a deep breath and said,\u201cWhy did he come?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIsthere something wrong with the manager? Did he follow Inseop to kill him?\u201d\u201cHow should I know?\u201d\u201cOf course the CEO should know. Who else would know?\u201d\u201cWould I be like this if I knew what he was thinking? Come on.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t we just cancel the contract? If it was Lee Wooyeon anyway, there would be a lot of agencies to pick from.\u201dManager Cha spat out the words he really wanted to say that he had kept in his heart. CEO Kim, who was eating udon, glared and looked at him asking what he was talking about.\u201cI\u2019m so nervous when I see him. It\u2019s because he really doesn\u2019t talk. When I think about how hard he worked as a manager, really.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to tell me what to do.\u201dDid he know how hard he had it back then? It was manager Cha who stripped CEO Kim off of his repertoire. Thanks to this, he had never paid for it while drinking with CEO Kim. The Lee Wooyeon effect was that great.\u201cDo you think I have him because I like it? We\u2019re going to review the list in 3 months. What\u2019s the point of terminating the contract with Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cSo, I\u2019m even more anxious. What would you do if you had an accident with a child like that and suddenly got delisted? CEO, aren\u2019t you completely risking your life for that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m betting. Of course I\u2019m betting.\u201dCEO Kim was focusing his efforts on listing so much that he was secretly going to the hospital due to stress.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m paying more attention to Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even care after hiring a rookie manager.\u201dAs manager Cha mumbled like an old man, CEO Kim put down his chopsticks aloud on the table\u201cThat\u2019s why you have to take care of it.\u201d\u201cYou still haven\u2019t given up on that dream?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf I call the reporters and have a press conference and tell them I\u2019m going to die with CEO, are you going to throw them away? That chubby dream.\u201d\u201cOkay. I won\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWhen CEO Kim politely handed the apology, manager Cha nodded and accepted the apology. Both of them had simple and uncanny personalities, so many things had happened, but they were able to be together until now. Manager Cha, who was grumbling like an old man, squinted and asked again.\u201cLee Wooyeon and Kang Youngmo. Aren\u2019t you a little nervous?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll figure it out well enough. He\u2019s like a fox.\u201dHe said so in front of Lee Wooyeon earlier, but inside, it was CEO Kim, who believed in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s pretense. To be exact, he wanted to believe.\u201cYes. Looking at the fact that the tail hasn\u2019t been stepped on yet, even that fox is not an ordinary fox. It was luck in a way that we caught him that day\u2026 Was it bad luck?\u201dThe expressions of the two, who were recalling the memories of blood, became dark. The depressed faces of the men who knew that they would like to live without knowing filled each other\u2019s glasses of water.Clink.The two encouraged each other by hitting their stainless steel glasses together silently.Cha, who was drinking water and cleaning his mouth, suddenly asked an essential question once again.\u201cWhy is he here? Lee Wooyeon.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

come?Lee Wooyeon was asking himself that question.Why did he come?\u00a0Why was he here?He turned his head and looked inside the bathroom to find the person holding the answer.\u00a0He frowned at the musty smell peculiar to public toilets.\u00a0Outside, a group of women were waiting for him, some still standing.Did they have no shame?No matter how good a man was, he wondered if he would want to do that in front of the bathroom.\u00a0When women fell in love, it seemed that their body secretes hormones that made them lose their mind.\u00a0When he remembered that women often waited for him in the shower or locker room even when he was in America, it didn\u2019t seem to be a particular characteristic of Asian women either.Wiping off the moisture on his hands, Lee Wooyeon remembered the women who were fighting while waiting for him in front of the locker room, punching and fighting.\u00a0A soft smile hung on his thick lips.He couldn\u2019t even remember the names or faces of the women who fought over him.\u00a0All he could think of was the people gathered around him with excited faces saying there was a fight between the two queen bees, the ones who were the best in school.It was a fun scene.Wooyeon wiped the corner of his mouth with his still dry hands.\u2018You shouldn\u2019t play with people\u2019s emotions\u2019, said Dr. Arnold, his doctor.\u00a0No, it may have been Dr. Henry.\u00a0It didn\u2019t matter who.\u00a0From a young age, he had always been indoctrinated with that.\u2018People have feelings, and those feelings are to be respected, and under no circumstances should you play with people\u2019s feelings.\u2019\u00a0At the age of eight, he accepted the doctor\u2019s advice.\u00a0He realized that he could not be healed even after hundreds of treatments, but one day he decided to accept that fact.He thought that\u00a0if he couldn\u2019t understand, he could just memorize it.Still, he had to admit that sometimes things that he couldn\u2019t memorize existed.\u00a0Such was the behavior of the manager who brought him here today.\u00a0Human emotions generally moved within a pattern that could be memorized, but Choi Inseop did not.\u00a0He was a mess, like a person without a frame.\u00a0The existence that was moving hard along that messy movement caught Lee Wooyeon\u2019s attention.\u00a0He was intrigued by the behavior he saw for the first time.\u00a0He knew he would lose interest once he got used to it, but it was true that it caught his eye at first.Gradually, he got tired of it, but something interesting happened.After putting on sunglasses and a hat before going out, Lee Wooyeon looked inside the bathroom again.\u00a0The only thing that caught his eye was the bastard who had been staring at him with anxious eyes.\u00a0The manager and him seemed to have missed each other.As he turned around, he paused and stopped his feet.He didn\u2019t hear it wrong.Lee Wooyeon looked back.\u00a0When their eyes met, the yellow-haired bastard standing at the edge of the bathroom was noticeably anxious.\u00a0Without hesitation, he walked to the end of the bathroom and pulled the doorknob.\u00a0Pushing the bastard trying to stop him, he kicked the bathroom door with his foot.\u00a0A couple of kicks broke the doorknob.\u00a0There were still scenes that were difficult for Lee Wooyeon to memorize.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.\u00a0In fact, it was a situation that anyone with eyes could understand at a glance without asking.\u00a0A dirty-looking man was holding Choi Inseop from behind with his undershirt upright.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s face, covered with dirty hands, was covered in tears.\u00a0The man who had been anxiously watching Lee Wooyeon from before was either on the lookout or waiting for his turn.\u00a0Either way it didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0The fact that he was faced with such a situation itself was unpleasant.\u00a0He\u2019d come across scenes like this a few times in his life, but he couldn\u2019t help but be stiff every time.\u00a0It was something he didn\u2019t even want to acknowledge.Even while attending school in the United States, it was not limited to women who showed a crush on him.\u00a0It was easier than closing his eyes for him, who had a social and physical advantage over the losers who looked at him passionately.\u00a0As long as it didn\u2019t harm him, it was enough to pretend he didn\u2019t know.\u00a0He didn\u2019t feel the need to spend his emotion on it.\u00a0But now, it was someone who had something to do with him.With a hardened face, Lee Wooyeon reached out and grabbed Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201dWith strength, he pulled his body away from the man.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who pulled Choi Inseop out of it with ease as if he was shaking off dirty dust, continued talking as if he didn\u2019t care about other men.\u201cThe CEO and the manager are waiting in the car, so please go first.\u201d\u201cI, I\u2026\u201dIt was disgustingly sad to see him trying to say something with his pale blue lips because he couldn\u2019t breathe properly.\u201cI\u2019ll listen to you later.\u201dHe didn\u2019t really want to hear what was going on inside.\u00a0What was important to Lee Wooyeon was to get out of this unpleasant situation.\u201cGo to the car and wait.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dHe was annoyed at Choi Inseop, who was trying to explain as if he still had something to say.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon gave strength to the hand holding his shoulder and whispered in a low voice.\u201cI\u2019m not doing this out of curiosity.\u00a0There\u2019s nothing good about being noticed by other people.\u00a0Such a dirty situation.\u201dIt was a small voice, but it was enough to be heard by Choi Inseop as well as the man who was holding him.\u201cWhat?\u00a0Dirty?\u00a0Who are you, you bastard?\u201dThe man grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s neck.\u00a0Choi Inseop reached out and tried to stop him, but Lee Wooyeon told him with a soft tone.\u201cGo out and wait.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d\u201cGo out and wait.\u201dHis eyes were smiling, but his voice was cold.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulders trembled.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pushed his shoulder.\u00a0He arranged his ruffled clothes with trembling hands and went outside.\u00a0A group of women were standing in front of the bathroom waiting for Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0His legs were shaking and he had to lean against the wall in front of the bathroom and wait for Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Not long after, Lee Wooyeon walked out with a clean expression as usual.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re\u00a0late.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon wrapped his arms around Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder and said that, screams erupted from among the women around him.\u00a0He looked like a kind celebrity who took care of his manager.Choi Inseop lost strength in his legs and it was not easy to even walk.\u00a0If Lee Wooyeon hadn\u2019t supported him by pretending to be walking shoulder-to-shoulder, he would have hesitated because he couldn\u2019t even walk a few steps.\u00a0Choi Inseop tried to explain the accident in the bathroom.\u00a0However, there were too many people around to see Lee Wooyeon.Lee Wooyeon gave strength to the hand that was placed on Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder and released it.\u00a0With that brief movement, Choi Inseop was able to accurately grasp his intentions.Don\u2019t do any nonsense.It wasn\u2019t a ferocious look or a harsh voice, but with a simple gesture, it felt like the other person\u2019s malice was flowing into his body.\u00a0He didn\u2019t feel well.\u00a0Choi Inseop stood, covering his lips with the palm of his hand.\u201cAre you unwell?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice was very kind and his eyes were also friendly.\u00a0But Choi Inseop could no longer stand leaning on him.\u00a0He was out of breath.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t breathe, as if someone had pumped out all the air around him.\u00a0He knew he was fine now, but he often had psychogenic seizures like that.\u00a0He felt like he was drowning.\u00a0He pushed Lee Wooyeon away.\u00a0It was a struggle to live.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know how he swung his hand.\u00a0As far as he could, he pushed Lee Wooyeon away.Actually, he was pushed back a couple of steps, but that was enough for Choi Inseop.It was as if he had been clamped in a vise, his breathing was open.\u00a0He was coughing and salivating.\u00a0After a while, he heard a soft voice from behind.\u201cPeople are watching.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll take you to the car.\u201dAlthough he sounded worried, Inseop knew that he was as worried about him as he would about his fingernails.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon stood next to Choi Inseop and waited for him to raise his head.\u201c\u2026Sorry.\u00a0For causing trouble\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0Never mind.\u201dChoi Inseop discovered that there was a small blood stain on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s collar.\u00a0There were no scars anywhere on his face.\u201cI\u2019ll take you to the car.\u201dChoi Inseop looked helplessly in the direction of the bathroom he had come out of earlier.\u00a0Once inside, he didn\u2019t know that the evidence he had been looking for so much would remain.\u00a0But he couldn\u2019t go back to that place again because of that one possibility.\u00a0Just the thought of going back there made his body lose energy and his breathing quickened.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed his arm.\u00a0He could feel the strength that pushed him away easily before in the firm hand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed his arm and led him into the car.\u00a0There had never been a moment when his will, weak enough to cry, was so resentful.The morning of the day he went to school, he felt like he was getting worse.\u00a0In fact, he didn\u2019t have a fever and he didn\u2019t have any problems, but he felt several times worse than the days he laid in bed and did nothing.\u00a0From the moment he got on the school bus, his whole body felt weak.\u00a0A dwarf and small Asian boy entered the school with a wild imagination that his body would shrink and disappear from the world someday.\u00a0After a long absence from school, no one greeted him.\u00a0Even after class, it was time for a break.\u00a0He often imagined that his name might be a curse word that should not be uttered.\u00a0If someone calls out his name, the curse may be lifted.It was a secret that no one could tell that he, as a man, imagined the ugly duckling becoming a swan.\u00a0But he couldn\u2019t stop imagining it.\u00a0If he stopped even that, it was as if the support to withstand the difficult reality would disappear.In his imagination, he was the best at whatever he did.\u00a0Physics, math, running, fencing, basketball.\u00a0No matter what he did, he received praise from people, and their love was monopolized.\u300cIsn\u2019t it a bit harsh to be monopolized?\u300dHe shook his head and headed to the library.\u00a0He was thinking of borrowing a book for a long time.\u00a0As he spends most of his free time sitting in bed or on a chair, he thought that the habit of reading a book might be self-defense in order not to die from boredom.\u00a0He greeted the librarian, one of the few people he knew in school, and went into the library.\u00a0He picked up a few travel books.\u00a0He has never traveled because of his health, but he made a plan to go on a trip when his body was healthy.\u00a0Just like his parents, his sisters, of course.\u00a0So, who will take care of Will?\u00a0Did he want Aunt Stacey to take care of him?\u00a0Aunt Stacey was very forgetful and may not be able to take care of Will\u2019s food.Worried about his incoming thoughts, Peter left the library with the borrowed book.\u00a0Someone tapped him on the shoulder as he was walking with a book in his bag.\u00a0As a result, the books spilled on the floor.\u00a0Peter quickly picked up the book.\u300cHey, China.\u300dHe heard a voice over his head.\u00a0It was Fred.\u00a0Fred was in the same grade as Peter, but he was tall enough to look a couple years older.\u00a0It was only natural that Peter\u2019s complexion turned blue when he heard the voice of Fred, who had been following and tormenting him since the beginning of the semester.\u300cChina.\u00a0Where are you going?\u300dChino and China were nicknames used to demean Asians.\u00a0Peter wanted to say that his nationality was American and that he was born in Korea, not China, but he already knew that all those things were useless.\u00a0Such a distinction was meaningless to humans who deliberately used the name Chi-na and Chi-no to insult Peter.\u300cChina, what are you going to do after reading a book like that?\u300dFred and the others around him giggled and made fun of him.\u300cWhere are you going to travel?\u300d\u300cWhat does it say?\u00a0Korea?\u00a0Where is Korea?\u300d\u300cIsn\u2019t this a country where war broke out?\u00a0Hi, Arigatou.\u300dThe ignorant guys who couldn\u2019t even tell the difference between Japan and Korea giggled again.\u00a0Peter quickly picked up the book and tucked it into his bag.\u00a0He wanted to get out of this place as soon as possible.\u00a0Seeing that Fred was stepping on a book, Peter carefully pointed to the book with a trembling hand.\u300cI\u2026I am reading that book.\u300d\u300cAnd?\u300d\u300cIt\u2019s a book I borrowed from the library, so I have to return it cleanly.\u300dNoticing the trembling of Peter\u2019s voice as he was speaking, the people around him burst into laughter.\u00a0Fred picked up the book under his feet,\u00a0\u00a0\u300cThis?\u300dhe\u00a0asked.\u300cYes.\u00a0Back\u2026\u00a0!\u300dHe reached out, but to no avail.\u00a0Fred raised his heels below him and looked down funnily at Peter, who was stunned.\u300cWhat are you going to do with a book like this?\u300d\u300cGive it back.\u300d\u300cYou want to go back to your country?\u300dOccasionally, they cursed Peter to return to his country.\u00a0Adopted to America at the age of one, Peter had no country to return to.\u00a0The country he had no memory of was just one of the distant countries.\u00a0He has been learning Korean since he was a child according to the will of his second-generation Korean father, but he never thought of himself as a Korean.\u300cGet out of our country.\u00a0China.\u300dThe boy standing next to Fred kicked Peter in the ass and teased him.\u00a0\u300cI understand,\u300d\u00a0exclaimed Peter in an angry tone.\u300cWhat?\u300d\u300cI\u2019m going.\u00a0I\u2019m leaving, so give me the book!\u300dFred, who didn\u2019t expect a skinny Asian boy to yell at him, was stunned, while Peter stole the book.\u300cI don\u2019t want to be with kids like you either!\u300d\u300cSo you\u2019re going back to China?\u300d\u300cIt\u2019s Korea, not China, you can\u2019t tell the difference, but it\u2019s completely different\u2026\u00a0!\u300dHe couldn\u2019t finish speaking and shut my mouth.\u00a0Fred slapped Peter in the face with his fist.\u300cFuck, where do you think a bastard like you goes!\u300dFred was furious and started punching as if Peter had uttered something he shouldn\u2019t have said.\u00a0At first, the guys who giggled and watched started to look worried as the severity got worse.\u300cFred, this bastard has a heart condition, so if you hit him like that\u2026\u00a0\u300d\u300cShut up, damn, who said I\u2019m going to hit him?\u300d\u300cThere are too many eyes to see Fred\u2026\u300dFred grabbed Peter\u2019s hair as he was spilling his nosebleed.\u00a0Then he dragged him into the empty gym room.As he threw him on the dusty mat, he felt a lump of blood rushing down his throat.\u00a0The friends who knew Fred\u2019s personality only pretended to stop him a few times, but no one followed.\u00a0Fred came in and locked the door.\u300cWhat?\u00a0Where are you going?\u300d\u300c\u2026\u00a0\u300d\u300cI asked where you were going!\u300dThick palms caressed his cheeks.\u00a0The blood that had pooled in his mouth splattered onto the mat.\u00a0Peter didn\u2019t like Fred.\u00a0Even though he did not commit any crimes, he could hardly understand him, who often followed him, teased him, hid books, and tormented him.\u300c\u2026\u00a0does not exist.\u300d\u300cWhat?\u300d\u300cIt doesn\u2019t matter where in the country as long as you aren\u2019t there.\u300dHe still couldn\u2019t understand where that courage came from.\u00a0Even after saying those words, Peter\u2019s hands and feet trembled in fear of being beaten.\u00a0Fred, who had a look as if he had been hit with a single blow, bit his lip and spoke.\u300cTake that back.\u300d\u300c\u2026\u00a0\u300d\u300cTake that back, you asshole!\u300dThe more Fred\u2019s face grew, the more frightened Peter became.\u00a0But at the same time, it was refreshing.\u00a0The reason was unknown, but it was clear that he had hurt Fred\u2019s self-esteem.\u300cTake that back!!!\u300dHe was terrified of Fred, who used his evil squeaking sound, but Peter shook his head.\u00a0Fred screamed and flew over Peter\u2019s body.\u00a0Peter closed his eyes, ready to be beaten.\u00a0But it wasn\u2019t physical violence that came over his body.\u300cYou fucking Asian bastard.\u300dIt wasn\u2019t until Fred unzipped his pants that Peter realized what this meant.\u00a0Peter saw that the blonde haired bastard Fred had blonde hair down there too.\u300cWhat, what\u2026\u00a0\u300dBefore he could finish speaking, Fred grabbed Peter\u2019s pants and pulled him down.\u00a0It was then that Peter realized that the other party was trying to use violence against him with other intentions.\u00a0He was nauseated.\u00a0He waved his arms desperately.\u00a0However, it was not enough to face Fred, who was twice his size.\u300cFuck, be still.\u00a0Be still!\u300dExcited, Fred grabbed Peter\u2019s arms and pressed them to the floor.\u00a0Peter shouted, shaking his head with a bloody nose.\u00a0\u300cTake it off, don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t touch it.\u300d\u00a0Fred then covered his mouth with the palm of his hand.\u00a0His palms were thick as steel.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t breathe.\u00a0Peter struggled to breathe, but the more he did, the less oxygen he had.\u00a0Even in the midst of his increasingly distant mind, he felt goosebumps at Fred\u2019s touch, panting and touching his body.That was when\u00a0with a popping sound, Fred\u2019s heavy body fell on his own.\u300cAre you\u2026\u00a0okay?\u300dIt was a trembling voice.A fat girl with bad-grained blonde hair with side braids held a flat trophy in one hand.\u00a0Her face, stained with sweat and dust, looked incredibly messy.\u00a0It was a fact that he learned later, but that day, she also said that she was locked up in the gym for more than two hours because of bullying by girls.\u300cCan you stand up?\u300dShe held out her hand.\u00a0Her hands were larger and more generous than Peter.\u00a0Peter took her hand.That was his first meeting with Jenny.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

who came to the bathroom, washed his hands in cold water as usual.\u00a0As his fingertips tingled, his mind became clearer.\u00a0He murmured as he looked at himself in the mirror.Calm down.\u00a0Should be good.\u00a0Let\u2019s endure it even when it\u2019s hard.As he washed his hands, he mumbled all the phrases he had seen in other books about mind control.\u00a0He was so absorbed in the act of washing his hands that he did not even realize that someone was near him.\u00a0The man in ragged clothes said something.\u00a0The moment he raised his head because he couldn\u2019t understand well, the man\u2019s eyes met his.\u00a0He had a bad feeling, so he thought he had to get out immediately.\u00a0The man asked to borrow a lighter.\u00a0Inseop said he didn\u2019t smoke, but the man kept repeating the same thing over and over.\u00a0He wondered if it was the Korean-Chinese who was somehow awkward with the way he spoke.\u00a0When he first came to Korea, Inseop didn\u2019t even know what Korean-chinese meant.\u00a0When he said strange things or some words were difficult to understand, Koreans asked him if he was Korean-Chinese, so he searched the Internet for what it was.\u00a0Inseop looked through his pockets and pretended he had nothing.\u00a0Then another man behind him suddenly covered Inseop\u2019s mouth with his palm.\u00a0He was choked with disgust as if insects were crawling all over his body.\u00a0He struggled, but he couldn\u2019t stand the strength of the two men.\u00a0The man who dragged him to the corner of the bathroom, lowered his pants and started groping his body.\u00a0Inseop couldn\u2019t even make a sound as his mouth was blocked by his clasped hands.\u00a0He wanted to call Jenny\u2019s name.\u00a0But he knew that even if he called her name, she wouldn\u2019t be there to help.\u00a0Tears spilled out.\u00a0Whoever it was, he cried out to help him.\u00a0Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.As in the morning of that day, he constantly called out Jenny\u2019s name.\u00a0The door opened and someone came in.\u00a0The moment he saw that person\u2019s face, his mind went blank.\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cDid you

be absurd.\u00a0We have less than thirty minutes left to reach the villa.\u201dAfter hearing the voices of CEO Kim and Manager Cha, Inseop knew where he was.Choi Inseop.\u00a0A twenty-four-year-old Korean man disguised as twenty-six.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u00a0He was currently traveling somewhere in Gangwon-do.It was all a dream.He blinked a couple of times.\u00a0Tears were welling up in the corners of his eyes, running down his cheeks.\u00a0He quickly wiped away the tears with his palm and looked at Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting next to him.Lee Wooyeon, who was reading the script, turned his head and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re still not feeling well?\u201d\u00a0Hearing that sweet voice, everything that happened before he got into the car felt like a lie.\u00a0It was a very brief moment, but Inseop could feel the cold side of Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t an illusion.\u00a0In and out of the bathroom, he treated him as badly as anyone else.\u201cDrink some water.\u201dWooyeon offered him a bottled water.\u00a0Choi Inseop accepted it, but continued to glance at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side face.\u201cInseop must have drooled on Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder while sleeping, did you wipe it off?\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s face turned bright red at CEO Kim\u2019s words, who was sitting in the front seat.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe rummaged through his pockets, pulled out a handkerchief, and looked around Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulders, anxiously trying to find the saliva marks that were left behind.\u201cThe president was joking.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Yes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a joke, a joke.\u201d\u201cRight.\u00a0I was joking.\u00a0How can Lee Wooyeon leave a sleeping man drooling on his shoulder?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh.\u201dManager Cha quietly hit the side of CEO Kim, who was stuttering useless words, with his fingertips.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and took out a pen and started writing something on the script.-I didn\u2019t tell anyone what happened before.\u00a0Would that be okay?Choi Inseop nodded slightly.It was something he didn\u2019t even want to say out of his own mouth.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even want to tell anyone about it as he didn\u2019t want their worry or comfort\u2026 In fact, it was worse that Wooyeon found out about the situation.\u00a0Not feeling well just thinking about it, Choi Inseop continued to drink water.\u201cAh, by the way, those bastards were really annoying earlier.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like that wherever you go these days, huh?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dChoi Inseop, who had been listening to the conversation that was happening in the front, asked.\u00a0As soon as he got into the car because he wasn\u2019t feeling well, he fell asleep as if he fainted.\u201cSome crazy bastards made a sudden stop in front of us and we almost got into an accident.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cAh, really.\u00a0Throwing cigarette butts in my car.\u00a0How much is this tint?\u201dCEO Kim reluctantly grinded his teeth and swept down the car glass with his palm.\u201cThey suddenly lowered the glass of their car and cursed in Chinese, but I thought they were crazy bastards.\u201dChoi Inseop, who had heard CEO Kim\u2019s grumbling, looked at Lee Wooyeon with an anxious face.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon gently raised one eyebrow and made a troubled expression.\u00a0They looked fine in the bathroom earlier.\u201cWeren\u2019t they Korean-Chinese?\u00a0They could be.\u201d\u201cThey were Korean-Chinese and they cursed at me, those Chinese bastards\u201dCEO Kim casually made remarks that would be marked as racially discriminatory if they had been heard by others.When Choi Inseop\u2019s complexion turned pale again, Lee Wooyeon wrote on the script again and showed it to Inseop.\u201cWhen you were sleeping, there were some trivial things that happened.\u201dEven looking at the letters, Inseop\u2019s anxiety did not subside.\u201cYou have nothing to worry about.\u00a0It\u2019s not like we\u2019ll see them twice anyway.\u201dChoi Inseop hesitated for a moment, then motioned for the pen to be handed to him.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon gave the pen, he carefully wrote down the letters.\u201cSorry.\u00a0For letting you get caught up in something unpleasant.\u201dUnpleasant.Choi Inseop was not in a good mood even as he wrote it himself.\u00a0It was more shameful than he could have imagined, for a man to be seen as such an object by another man and to be subjected to such a thing under the pressure of physical force.The moment the bathroom door opened and he saw Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face for the first time, the thought that entered his head was, \u201cI don\u2019t want to live and die instead.\u201d\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon pulled him out of it, there was an instinctive feeling of anxiety in his heart.He shouldn\u2019t have done that.If he looked at the facts alone, Lee Wooyeon took the risk and saved him.\u00a0Regarding that, it was right to exclude personal feelings and thank him properly.Should he say thank you?\u00a0Will it just go away as if nothing ever happened?\u00a0Can he have the feeling of gratitude towards Lee Wooyeon?\u2026\u00a0It would be better to do it though.Choi Inseop picked up the pen.\u00a0The moment he was about to write a thank you, CEO Kim exclaimed in an excited voice.\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201dWhen they arrived at the entrance of the villa, he undid his seat belt, screaming loudly like a child.\u00a0It was a mansion with many large windows and gray-white exterior walls giving it a modern feel.\u00a0The lake was not far away, and the mountain could be seen in the background.\u00a0Choi Inseop could understand why President Kim praised his villa so much before coming here.\u201cHow is it?\u00a0My cottage.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cInseop.\u00a0That\u2019s good, not a single word, but a more glamorous rhetoric.\u201dChoi Inseop frowned for a moment at the word glamorous rhetoric, and then used the phrase used by young people these days.\u201cKing Wang is the best.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo \u2026Hahaha, it\u2019s a splendid rhetoric.\u201dManager Cha, who parked the car, unloaded the luggage from the trunk.\u00a0When Choi Inseop went to the side and tried to help him, he waved his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Inseop is not feeling well.\u00a0Go and rest.\u201d\u201cWhat made you so sick?\u00a0You still have a sickly face.\u201dChoi Inseop, who had gone to the bathroom, was put in the back of the car, and Lee Wooyeon blamed the car sickness for his poor condition.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon gently pushed Inseop\u2019s shoulder, who was about to move the luggage, saying it was okay now.\u201cGo and rest.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop, unable to say anything, stood tall.\u00a0Even knowing the fact that he said these words with consideration for him, strangely, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, every word, came to him with weight.\u00a0Being caught in the bathroom didn\u2019t help at all, instead he felt as if he had a weakness.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Come here.\u00a0Look at this.\u00a0Isn\u2019t the view amazing?\u201dExcitedly, CEO Kim pointed to the lake and told him to think of it as his own.\u00a0He was quite different from the stylish CEO in the office who was well dressed and treated his employees.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to, but Choi Inseop started to notice the good things of the people around him and it was difficult.Manager Cha saw CEO Kim and went inside the villa with his luggage.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took the rest of the luggage from the car and went inside.\u201cThe caretaker prepared well.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u00a0I just called him a few days ago.\u201dThe walls and floors were all made of parquet.\u00a0Inseop, who had changed into the slippers he had prepared, looked around the inside of the villa without hesitation.\u201cInseop, sit there and rest.\u201dCEO Kim pointed to the sofa.\u00a0Inseop carefully sat on the sofa and looked around with a blank expression on his face.\u201cHow is it?\u00a0Is it okay?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s\u00a0great.\u201d\u201cWhen I built this, I lived in Gangwon-do for a month. If you don\u2019t nag the builders, the work will be delayed, so you have to keep an eye on them.\u201d\u201cIt was really hard back then.\u00a0There were a lot of things to deal with, but the CEO was crazy about the villa and didn\u2019t come to the office.\u201dManager Cha sighed as he recalled the past.\u201cStill, I did all the paperwork to pay.\u201d\u201cThe CEO just said ok and I stamped it.\u00a0Of course, I also reviewed all the documents.\u201d\u201cI gave you a bonus.\u201d\u201cHuh, that was just a small bonus.\u201dChoi Inseop, who saw the two of them fighting like old friends, said.\u201cThe two of you must be really close.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not close at all.\u00a0My road manager was pitiful, so I kept him.\u201d\u201cHe he he.\u00a0CEO.\u00a0If I take the kids and talk about the days when the CEO played, no one will listen to the CEO anymore.\u201d\u201cHey man, Manager Cha.\u00a0Talking about it now, it\u2019s a riot.\u201d\u201cWho would listen to what a nosy person is saying? Why are you so serious?\u201dManager Cha, who laughed playfully, grabbed Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder and continued.\u201cMake sure you have at least one or two weaknesses of the celebrity you are in charge of.\u00a0The day will come when it will become your property.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was looking around the house, put his hand on his waist and burst into laughter.\u201cHahaha.\u00a0The manager is really.\u00a0Are you instructing Inseop to uncover my weaknesses?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, I mean\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are my weaknesses?\u201dLee Wooyeon frowned playfully.\u00a0However, all three other men did not accept the prank and their faces turned pale.\u201cThat is \u2026other celebrities.\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0I mean, if you take on other celebrities, that\u2019s it.\u00a0Wooyeon has no weaknesses\u2026 does not exist.\u201dManager Cha stuttered and continued.\u201cI have no intention of becoming another celebrity\u2019s manager.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dChoi Inseop, who had said his true feelings without realizing it, said, lowered his head.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon made a more pleasant laugh than before.\u201cWould Lee Wooyeon make Inseop the fan club president?\u201dWhen CEO Kim told the joke, Choi Inseop only shook his head with a bare face.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was happily looking at Inseop like that, turned around and said.\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d\u201cSecond floor.\u201dAs CEO Kim pointed to the stairs, Lee Wooyeon naturally climbed the stairs as if it was his own house.\u00a0As soon as his figure disappeared, the two sat down next to Inseop.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Did something happen before?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIs it that Korean-Chinese or Chinese?\u00a0What happened to Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes?\u201dIn the car, Wooyeon clearly said that he would not say anything to the two of them.\u00a0Choi Inseop chose to breathe slowly as he felt the blood draining from his fingertips.\u201cNothing\u2026\u00a0 there was none.\u201dIt was always difficult to lie.\u00a0Still, he couldn\u2019t help it.\u00a0Inseop didn\u2019t want anyone else to know about the terrible things that had happened to him.\u201cReally?\u00a0There must have been an argument.\u201dManager Cha, who was organizing the luggage said to CEO Kim, \u201cRight?\u201d\u201cClearly there was something.\u00a0Otherwise, Wooyeon will not throw it\u2026\u00a0Ha ha ha ha, there is dust here.\u201dManager Cha, who was talking, suddenly bent down and pretended to wipe off the dust.\u00a0When Choi Inseop turned around, CEO Kim rolled his eyes and changed his expression.\u201cWhat happened while I was asleep?\u201d\u201cNo, I was just asking just in case the Chinese suddenly picked a fight.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dHe said so, but CEO Kim Hakseung was extremely concerned.When a madman made a sudden stop in front of him and they almost had an accident, he threw all kinds of curses at him.The people who spit on his newly bought Evoque, raised their middle finger, and swore in unintelligible Chinese, made CEO Kim angry to the point of being pushed back.\u00a0Just as he was about to point his finger at those crazy people and swear at them, Lee Wooyeon, who was quietly reading the script from behind, stretched out and brought something from behind.\u00a0Then he opened the window and threw a spanner at them.\u00a0It happened before he could stop him.When he saw the spanner stuck in the windshield of the car, CEO Kim shouted in surprise.\u00a0After all, there could have been a really big accident.However, Lee Wooyeon motioned for him to be quiet and sat down as if it was no big deal and started reading the script again.\u00a0It was a very minor incident that happened when Choi Inseop was asleep, leaning on the seat, moaning.It was also a small incident that showed what kind of person Lee Wooyeon was, who generously showed his true personality in front of CEO Kim and Manager Cha.\u201cOh, Wooyeon didn\u2019t take this.\u201dManager Cha, who was organizing the luggage took out the shampoo from the bag.\u00a0Choi Inseop already knew that Lee Wooyeon only used a certain brand of shampoo.\u201cCan you take this to him?\u00a0I think I should go grocery shopping.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dChoi Inseop took the shampoo and stood up.\u201cHey, let\u2019s go together.\u00a0Let\u2019s buy beer and buy soju.\u00a0I\u2019ll buy the liquor.\u201dLooking at the back of CEO Kim, who followed Cha, Inseop recalled his relationship with Wooyeon and had a bitter taste.As he went upstairs, he quickly found the bathroom with the sound of running water.\u00a0As soon as he raised his hand to knock, the door swung open.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201d\u201cUh.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who opened the door, was also surprised.\u00a0Choi Inseop held out the shampoo he was holding in his hand.\u201cThank you.\u00a0Anyway, I was just about to go down now.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who had only one towel around his waist, smiled and took the shampoo.\u00a0Choi Inseop put his gaze elsewhere and spoke calmly.\u201cThen, please take a shower.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s laughter leaked out from the crack in the door that\u00a0was about to close\u00a0.\u00a0Choi Inseop also thought that he had made a mistake and came down the stairs, tilting his head.After taking a shower, Lee Wooyeon came down, wiping his hair with a towel.\u00a0In his training pants and a thin white T-shirt, Choi Inseop could understand what it means to say that everyday life became a CF.\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0They went shopping.\u201d\u201cThey did?\u201dLee Wooyeon sat down on the sofa.\u00a0Reading the script on the table, he leaned back on the backrest.\u00a0Inseop didn\u2019t know what to do at the smell of a man\u2019s shampoo, which he felt was too close, and he looked anxiously forward.Even the slightest movement was enough to touch his shoulder.\u00a0They even sat next to each other in the car, but after that incident, it was the first time they were alone.\u00a0His mouth was dry from the tight tension.After hesitating a few times, Inseop opened his mouth.\u201cEarlier\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWhere are you hurting?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s eyes widened like a puppy surprised by a sudden question.\u201cI think you are not feeling well.\u201d\u201cJust a little\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe couldn\u2019t say that his heart was not good, he was no different from a normal person now, but he couldn\u2019t say that he shouldn\u2019t overdo it yet.\u00a0Instead, he replied in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well.\u201dLee Wooyeon took out a cigarette from the cigarette pack on the table and lit it.\u00a0Choi Inseop was surprised.\u00a0According to the information he had gathered, he did not smoke.\u201cTobacco\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are times when I have to smoke while acting.\u00a0Sometimes, I smoke.\u201dThe appearance of Lee Wooyeon speaking with a cigarette in his lips seemed unfamiliar.\u00a0While reading the script, Choi Inseop stared blankly at the side of him smoking a cigarette with his forehead narrowed.\u00a0Then he inhaled cigarette smoke and coughed a little.\u201cDo you hate cigarette smoke?\u00a0Sorry.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dLee Wooyeon got up and opened the window.\u00a0He had wide shoulders.\u00a0The moment he looked at his shoulder, Inseop thought of a word.Quarterback.Jenny talked about the prince\u2019s shoulder enough to write a book about it.\u00a0The rapturous praise of the shoulder was always concluded with one line.He has the shoulders of a quarterback.Maybe that was why Choi Inseop often glanced at his shoulder without realizing it.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t smoke because I was exercising\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled faintly as he blew smoke into the air.Did it even bring back memories of the past?\u00a0Choi Inseop wondered what he was thinking.\u201cI smoke often, so this isn\u2019t bad either.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u00a0By the way, what kind of exercise did you do before?\u201dThe last question was asked in a more serious tone.\u00a0It was a feeling of wanting to give even a small scratch to Lee Wooyeon, who lived as if he had nothing to do with the past.When the manager, who is always modest, suddenly asked such a question, Wooyeon was a little surprised .\u201cThis and that.\u00a0I did it like everyone else.\u201dLee Wooyeon rubbed more than half of the remaining cigarette on the ashtray and put it out.\u00a0He stretched out his hand.\u00a0Putting the back of his hand on Choi Inseop\u2019s cheek,he said in a low voice.\u201cGet some rest.\u00a0You must have been very surprised.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dOn the back of his hand, he felt Inseop\u2019s whole body stiffen from his touch but he did not lift his hand.\u00a0He touched his forehead with his hand, and his face went pale.\u201cYou have a fever.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cForget such bad things.\u00a0It\u2019s like being bitten by a crazy dog.\u201dThe appearance of Choi Inseop nodding his head with a pale face as if he was about to collapse at his words reminded him of what he had always been taught not to do as a human being.Lee Wooyeon was different from others since childhood.\u00a0Parents liked that he was a polite little boy who could control his emotions.\u00a0However, it was only that he lacked the emotions to restrain himself in the first place.\u00a0He was a child who had to memorize it as a social norm rather than emotionally understanding why he shouldn\u2019t bully someone weaker than him.It wasn\u2019t like he had no emotion at all.\u00a0But in a way different from others, he felt pleasure.When others suffered, grieved, were sick, and in pain.Those things he enjoyed.He\u2019d been taught not to do that, that humans should respect the feelings of others, that was a social promise.\u00a0To live among the people, he accepted the promise.\u00a0But sometimes the urge to break that promise arose.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Where is it uncomfortable?\u201dWhen he bowed his back and looked at the complexion of his opponent, Inseop had a face that looked like he was going to faint.\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026\u00a0\u201dSeeing his manager barely saying that with his trembling lips, Lee Wooyeon swallowed a laugh inside.He thought it was well attached to the subject he disliked so much.He didn\u2019t shed any tears, but it was not much different from the look on his face from being attacked by a pervert in the bathroom.Lee Wooyeon, who suddenly remembered the scene that happened earlier, frowned slightly.\u00a0The very idea of committing such a thing to the same man did not fit his sensibility.\u00a0It was funny to say that someone like him was talking about sense.It was a scene he didn\u2019t want to see twice.\u201cGet some rest.\u201dLee Wooyeon said moving away.\u00a0Choi Inseop nodded, holding the hem of his robe in his hand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon stood up from his seat with the script.Previous Chapter<All

    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Love History Caused by Willful NegligenceCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIt\u2019s an outdoor barbecue.\u00a0There is no such luxury.\u201dCEO Kim shrugged his shoulders and smiled wildly.\u00a0Manager Cha, who was grilling meat next to him, said sarcastically.\u201cI\u2019m cooking all the meat, so the CEO is living in luxury.\u201d\u201cLet me cook.\u201dChoi Inseop, who had been restless for a while, held out his hand.\u00a0But Manager Cha shook his head.\u201cMr. Inseop it\u2019s okay.\u00a0You saw how well I was grilling a few pieces of meat earlier.\u201d\u201cThe meat is cooked well by Cha.\u201d\u201cI am very curious about what brought you here.\u201dEven if he said so, MAnager Cha\u2019s hand, who grilled meat, did not rest. After going to a nearby sashimi restaurant at lunch and tasting the effect of Lee Wooyeon, who paralyzed nearby roads, CEO Kim quietly went to a butcher\u2019s shop and bought meat. He decided that it would be impossible to even sleep in the villa, let alone fishing, if he continued to carry Lee Wooyeon around.In the end, the four of them had a barbecue in the front yard of the villa.\u201cManager Cha.\u00a0Even if you roast my meat for the rest of your life, you cannot complain.\u00a0You lost your last fishing bet.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because the president made a foul.\u201d\u201cYour foul play talk will freeze me to death.\u201d\u201cThe position of my fishing rod changed while I was in the bathroom.\u00a0If it\u2019s not you, who will touch it?\u201dManager Cha, grumbling with a face that said he would die of unfairness, grabbed Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder and started giving serious advice.\u201cIf you go fishing today, the key to successful fishing is whether that person touches your fishing rod or not.\u00a0Understand?\u201d\u201cYes?\u00a0Haha\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u00a0All right.\u201d\u201cWhat are you!\u00a0Seop.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Oh, Seop.\u00a0Seop.\u00a0This sticks in your mouth.\u00a0Shall I call you Seop from now on?\u201dChoi Inseop was bewildered and could not answer.\u00a0If even a nickname was attached, it would become difficult.\u00a0He was going to disappear without being noticed, but he started to feel like his plans were going wrong.\u00a0It also happened that Lee Wooyeon helped him with such a terrible thing today\u2026 Whatever it was, he should be fired within three months.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Don\u2019t you like Seop?\u00a0It sticks in your mouth and sounds good.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like it.\u00a0The representative doesn\u2019t even notice that?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0It\u2019s good.\u00a0You too, manager Cha, you said you didn\u2019t like your nickname at first, but later\u00a0 you said you liked it and keep using it.\u201dCha Hyeongyu\u2019s nickname was Cha Cha.\u00a0It was a nickname derived from his habit of waving a tambourine when he went to a karaoke room after drinking alcohol.\u00a0He used to introduce himself as the manager of cha-cha-cha when he went to a place where he had to show off the atmosphere.\u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201dManager Cha wrapped the meat in a large leaf and stuffed it into CEO Kim\u2019s mouth.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting on the chair looking at it, raised his sunglasses over his head and said.\u201cYou guys are like a couple.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201d\u201cLee Wooyeon\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t talk like that.\u201d\u201cCEO Kim is an indecisive husband.\u00a0Manager Cha is a wife who listens to everything his husband says while nagging.\u201dChoi Inseop wanted to express his strong agreement with Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words for the first time.\u201cHahaha.\u00a0Well, there was a wife in the middle, so it\u2019s not completely wrong.\u201dIn the meantime, CEO Kim, who felt superior to being referred to as a husband rather than a wife, gave a loud laugh.\u201cWhat does it mean that your wife is in the middle?\u201dChoi Inseop asked carefully, wondering if it was a Korean expression he did not know.\u00a0Because if it was a new Korean expression, he had to write it down in a vocabulary notebook.\u201cMy second wife was married to Manager Cha.\u00a0I told him not to do it, but he didn\u2019t listen to me and married her, and lost all the money he earned in alimony. Tsk tsk.\u201d\u201cHey, why are you talking about that here?\u201dManager Cha shouted, turning red.\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cYeah, you don\u2019t even have to talk about it\u2026\u00a0Ah really.\u201dManager Cha started drinking the beer from the bottle without pouring it into the cup.\u00a0As Kim said, it wasn\u2019t a false statement, it was the truth.\u00a0Mr. Cha, who married the second wife of CEO Kim, got divorced and went bankrupt, and it was CEO Kim who accepted him.\u00a0There was no such reason why manager Cha was loyal to CEO Kim.\u201cLee Wooyeon.\u00a0If you want to make your manager loyal, let your second wife marry your manager.\u00a0The moment they divorce, your manager will be loyal to you forever.\u201dManager Cha couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the words of CEO Kim, who knew how to turn painful reality into a gag.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was drinking beer, responded with a smile as well.\u201cI don\u2019t like other people laying their hands on my things\u201dNone of the three of them felt the strange inappropriateness of his words referring to women as objects.\u201cBut what do you call a case like this?\u201dChoi Inseop reflexively exclaimed at the question posed by Lee Wooyeon.This is what he knew!\u201cHole buddy\u2026\u00a0\u00a0Is that correct?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u00a0Inseop-ah.\u201dThe mouths of the two who suddenly became brothers had convulsions.\u00a0With a strange expression of holding back his laughter, Lee Wooyeon replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not wrong.\u201d\u201cI was trying to say \u2018Pillow Buddy\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201dChoi Inseop bowed his head.He learned Korean from his father at home from a young age, so he could use it like it was his mother tongue, but he had to study the vocabulary part and the slang used by people of today\u2019s generation separately.\u00a0Before coming to Korea, he used various dramas and internet bulletin boards to memorize slang, so sometimes he didn\u2019t know exactly what they meant.\u00a0That was exactly the situation as it is now.In the atmosphere, realizing that he had made a mistake, Choi Inseop apologized.\u00a0CEO Kim smiled emptily and patted Inseop\u2019s head.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0By the way, where did you learn such strange words?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0on the Internet.\u201d\u201cThe internet ruins all the kids.\u201dSuddenly, he felt like a child ruined by the Internet.\u00a0Choi Inseop quietly fiddled with the lettuce and waited for the meat to cook.Then he saw a white object approaching from afar.\u201cOh, Happy.\u201dWhen CEO Kim recognized him and called his name, the white-haired dog ran wagging until his tail.\u201cWho\u2019s is it?\u00a0That dog.\u201d\u201cThe dog from next door.\u00a0This guy knows me for a long time.\u201dWhen CEO Kim scratched his chin a couple of times, the white dog narrowed his eyes and wagged his tail to say he was in a good mood.\u00a0As soon as Choi Inseop saw the dog, he remembered Will he had left at home.\u00a0Now that he was an old dog, he was worried about whether Will, who lost his hair and couldn\u2019t see well, was doing well.Happy came to Choi Inseop\u2019s feet, sniffed it, and wagged his tail.Have fun with me, human.Even though he knew what it meant, Inseop did not readily reach out his hand.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Do you hate dogs? You\u2019re scared?\u00a0Oh, he doesn\u2019t bite.\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201dThe opposite was true.\u00a0He loved them so much that he just wanted to hug him and roll around in the front yard even now.\u201cThen touch him.\u00a0His tail will fall off.\u201dInseop carefully reached out his hand.\u00a0Then Happy put his front paw on it.\u00a0Everyone burst into laughter at the cute and funny appearance.\u00a0Choi Inseop also grabbed Happy\u2019s front paw and smiled brightly.\u201cSmile like that.\u00a0In the future.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSeop, you.\u00a0You do your job well, but you always look depressed.\u00a0Manager Cha was very worried.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I was worried in a different way.\u201dManager Cha\u2019s gaze fell on Lee Wooyeon for a moment.\u201cWhy is the young guy so clumsy in expressing his emotions?\u00a0Because you don\u2019t have to try too hard.\u00a0We\u2019re not bad people\u2026 No, not all of them are good.\u201dIt felt like a crime to put Lee Wooyeon in the category of good people, so CEO Kim quickly corrected his statement.\u201cThank you.\u00a0Thank you for caring.\u201d\u201cLook.\u00a0Again.\u00a0Laugh like you laugh at the dog.\u00a0From now on, forever.\u201dAfter saying that, CEO Kim wrapped the wrap by hand and put it in Choi Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u00a0The size of the lettuce wraps that filled his mouth made him shed tears.\u00a0He replied, munching on the lettuce wrap, saying that it was delicious.\u00a0That was all he could do now.Peter was an emotional boy.\u00a0There was a lot of laughter, a lot of crying, a lot of fear and a lot of dreams.\u00a0He was abandoned by his biological parents due to congenital heart disease and was adopted at the age of one, but he was brought up by parents who were more wonderful than anyone and was able to grow up as a boy with diverse emotions like a flower garden in spring.\u00a0When he was sad, he cried and when he was happy, he laughed out loud.\u00a0That was his way of life battling the disease.But Choi Inseop was not.\u00a0He was a person who had to suppress his emotions as much as possible, live like a shadow, and then disappear.\u00a0In fact, such a trip should not have come in the first place.\u00a0Choi Inseop felt guilty because it felt as if the little happiness or laughter he felt was betraying Jenny.Happy rubbed his head at Inseop\u2019s feet and showed affection.\u00a0In his heart, he wanted to hug him tightly and give him a lot of love, but Choi Inseop deliberately turned his head, pretending not to know.\u201cSeop.\u00a0Please take him to the next door.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe owner is an old man with limited mobility.\u00a0He thinks it\u2019s terrible, so if he doesn\u2019t see his dog for a long time, he will always look for him.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dChoi Inseop grabbed the dog\u2019s leash.\u00a0The dog thought he was going for a walk, so excitedly, he took the lead and started walking.\u00a0The moment he saw the dog\u2019s butt swaying with excitement, Inseop thought of the path he and Will had walked.As soon as he passed the outer wall of the villa and turned the corner, Inseop sat down and hugged him.\u00a0The dog, who had struggled at first in bewilderment, quickly wagged its tail and licked his face.\u201cWill\u2026 Will\u2026\u201dHe called him that, even though he knew it wasn\u2019t Will.\u00a0Tears streamed down his cheeks at the small warmth that engulfed his chest.\u00a0He felt the hot salt water rushing through his throat.He wanted to see Will.\u00a0He missed his mom and dad, his sisters, Aunt Stacey, his grandmother, and Jenny.\u00a0Pretending to be an adult, suppressing emotions, and doing bad things in an unfamiliar place was very difficult.Every time he touched the hearts of those who were kind to him, his heart broke.\u00a0He wanted to write on his chest that he was not worthy of such kindness, if possible.Above all, it was very difficult to look at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0It felt like someone had engraved a feeling of guilt into his heart with a sculpting knife.\u00a0It hurt.\u00a0However, he had to keep his promise to Jenny.\u00a0Because she was his dear friend.\u201cWill\u2026\u00a0\u201dAs Choi Inseop squirmed and shed tears, Happy licked his face and comforted him by licking him with his tongue.\u00a0Choi Inseop gave more strength to hug the dog.\u00a0Suddenly the dog started whining.\u201cUh, sorry\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop released his hand, but Happy hung his ears and ran behind him to hide.\u00a0Choi Inseop noticed that a long shadow was cast at his feet.\u201cAre you crying?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhy are you crying here?\u00a0Holding the dog.\u201dHe wanted to say no, but the tears he still couldn\u2019t wipe were running down his cheeks.\u00a0Choi Inseop quickly wiped his face with the hem of his sleeve.\u201cWhy did you cry?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was sitting with his knees bent in front of him, asked with a curious face.\u00a0There was no sign of concern or regret.\u00a0He was just curious.\u00a0Why was the manager hugging the dirty dog and crying?\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not feeling well\u2026\u00a0\u201dChoi Inseop made up the reason for crying with the most plausible lie.When he thought of his hometown, he wanted to throw everything away and go back, but he kept in mind the heavy promise with his friend that he cried.\u201cOh.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Choi Inseop and lifted him up and continued.\u201cAre you still unwell?\u00a0Then you should go in and rest.\u00a0Not here crying with a dog.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201d\u201cWhat do you have to be sorry for?\u00a0I am not sick.\u201dIt was a subtly contradictory conversation, but it wasn\u2019t a situation worth voicing.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon picked up Happy, who was whining from behind Choi Inseop, with one hand.\u00a0Happyi was struggling at first, but when Lee Wooyeon smiled and said \u201cStop,\u201d he stretched out and relaxed as if he understood what he was saying.\u201cI will take it.\u00a0Go in and rest.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop, who raised his head, closed his mouth to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes looking down at him. In the eyes assuming kindness, there was a sharpness that penetrated the other person. Choi Inseop realized that he was observing him, and his back cooled.Since when has he been staring at him like that?\u2026.\u201cGo in and rest.\u201d\u201c\u2026all right.\u201dHe had no choice but to do as he said.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who saw Lee Wooyeon\u2019s disappearing back with a dog in one hand, sighed.Looking at the crescent moon hanging from the end of the tree, he prayed that the long day would end soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I love what I\u2019m doing here right now\u2026 I love it.\u201dSuddenly, a large blanket wrapped around his body.\u201cWhat do you love so much?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u00a0!!\u201d\u201cAre you good?\u201dLee Wooyeon sat down next to him and asked.\u00a0Choi Inseop was surprised and couldn\u2019t shut his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s cold, so why are you here?\u00a0You\u2019re not feeling well.\u201d\u201c\u2026taking a walk\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have a cold.\u201dBecause of the blanket Lee Wooyeon covered him with, Choi Inseop noticed that his body was quite cold.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201dHaving said that, Lee Wooyeon did not get up from his seat and leaned back with his hands in his pockets.\u201cThe stars are so bright.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quiet.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dChoi Inseop thought that Lee Wooyeon would get up soon after.\u00a0But he rummaged through his pockets, pulled out a cigarette, and even took a bite.\u00a0It meant that he wouldn\u2019t get up until he had at least smoked a cigarette.Holding the blanket, Inseop was conflicted.\u00a0At what point would it be awkward to stand up?\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWith a cigarette in hand, Wooyeon called out Inseop\u2019s name.\u00a0Inseop thought that the name that was being called out was like choking him.\u201cWhy are you doing this, Mr. Inseop?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201dHe was taken aback by the sudden question.\u00a0His sharp gaze touched his skin like a needle.\u00a0Not knowing what kind of answer he was looking for, it was getting harder and harder to breathe for Choi Inseop, like a fish being dragged to the shore.\u201cSince I was little, I didn\u2019t quite understand why people were doing this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cNow I know what it is in general.\u00a0But I don\u2019t know what Mr. Inseop is.\u201dChoi Inseop thought hard.\u00a0And he gave him the best answer he could.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Manager.\u201dUpon hearing that answer, Wooyeon opened his eyes like a person who had been hit in the back of the head.\u00a0After a moment of silence, he burst into laughter.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0Yes.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u00a0You\u2019re a manager.\u00a0My manager.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled like it was really fun.\u201cHahaha. Okay.\u00a0What does the manager want?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there something you want?\u00a0From me.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you tell me now, I will listen.\u00a0I\u2019ll give you five seconds.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dChoi Inseop was confused because he did not know whether he was joking or not.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon started the countdown with a serious face.\u201c5.\u00a04. 3\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to know your weaknesses, your weaknesses!\u201dThat answer burst out of his mouth like an unconditional reflex that bounces off when he hits his knee.\u00a0Having said that, Choi Inseop\u2019s face turned white, wondering what he had done now.\u2018Crazy.\u00a0What did I say now\u2026\u2019\u201cA weakness?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMy weakness?\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed to himself and confirmed again.\u00a0Choi Inseop was about to go crazy.\u00a0The countdown, which started suddenly, made him go crazy.\u00a0Otherwise, he could not admit what he had just said.\u201cYou want to know my weakness?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0You don\u2019t even have to tell me.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop turned his gaze to another place and said that, Lee Wooyeon brought his face closer to him and asked.\u201cReally?\u00a0Can I really not tell you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe wanted to die.He couldn\u2019t do anything, he just wanted to die right now.\u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you.\u201dLee Wooyeon got up from his seat.\u00a0Choi Inseop grabbed the hem of his robe and shouted.\u201cPlease tell me!\u201dIt was a gamble.\u00a0He thought it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to hear it from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth, which he wouldn\u2019t be able to find out if he went on like this.Lee Wooyeon looked down at the hand holding his clothes.\u00a0A faint smile crept across his lips.\u201cOkay.\u00a0I will tell you.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s eyes twinkled as he raised his head and looked up at him.\u00a0He thought he looked younger even when he was wearing a suit, but he looked even younger when he was wearing casual clothes and his hair was messed up.\u00a0His eyes were clear like a boy in a dream.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon could read the hope in those eyes.\u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201dLee Wooyeon looked down at the lake and spoke.\u201cI can\u2019t swim.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEven when I was taking classes at school, I was always polka-dotting during swimming class.\u00a0I\u2019m good at other sports, but I can\u2019t really swim.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I seet.\u201dThe vitality disappeared from the twinkling eyes.\u00a0As fast as water seeping into the sand.Lee Wooyeon smiled and put his hand in his pocket.\u201cYeah, my manager knows my weakness and what is it going to be used for?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it meant to be used somewhere?\u00a0Do you want to pass it on somewhere?\u201d\u201cNo\u201d\u201cBut why?\u201dLee Wooyeon leaned over and looked directly at Choi Inseop\u2019s face and asked.\u00a0He was even looking forward to what he would answer now.\u201cI\u2026 I wanted to know.\u00a0Everything about Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u00a0Weaknesses, knowing it will help you someday.\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re my manager?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u201dIt was a stupid excuse enough to make him laugh.\u00a0Choi Inseop regretted falling for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s pun, but it was useless.Lee Wooyeon smiled happily.\u00a0A small ripple from his laughter spread across the surface of the lake.\u00a0He was standing narrowly on the shore of the lake.\u00a0Choi Inseop swallowed dry saliva as he looked at his shoulder exposed by the moonlight as a backlight.\u00a0It felt like his hands were shaking from tension and paralyzing every cell in his head.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s slender hand reached out from inside the soft blanket.\u201cAre you going to push me in?\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re next to me because you have a grudge against me, this is a great opportunity.\u201d\u201cOh, no. It\u2019s not\u00a0like that.\u201dA light of surprise passed across Choi Inseop\u2019s face.\u00a0Then embarrassment, shame, and even trouble.\u00a0Emotions that should not be revealed to the other party passed one by one.Until Lee Wooyeon smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m joking,\u201d Inseop\u2019s expression remained frozen.Wooyeon wanted to give Inseop advice.\u00a0If he wanted to deceive others, study a little more and come back.\u00a0He wanted to tell him that no one will be fooled by such clumsy craft that didn\u2019t even have the least amount of effort.He wanted to explain to the manager with an innocent face how careful he should be to deceive people.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201dIt was the first time.What made him decide to give such heartfelt advice to someone?\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dAs if noticing something, Choi Inseop\u2019s eyes widened like a puppy with his tail on fire.\u201cMr. Inseop\u2026\u201dBefore even starting the advice he was trying to give to the other person in good faith, Wooyeon felt a burning pain in the area of his head.\u00a0Choi Inseop screamed and stood up, but Wooyeon did not understand exactly what he was saying.\u00a0He touched the back of his head with his hand.\u00a0A dull pain swept through his back again before he could figure out what the damp liquid was.An unpleasant, incomprehensible language rang out loudly.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon noticed that it was the dirty Chinese people he had met at the rest stop that had hit him from behind.\u00a0He regretted adjusting the direction of the spanner he threw from the moving car so that it did not hit anyone.Lee Wooyeon swung his fists.\u00a0One guy was hit in the face and fell down, but the other guy hit Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder again with the wooden stick he was holding.\u00a0Choi Inseop rushed in and tried to stop the Chinese, but to no avail.\u00a0He was hit by a fist that wasn\u2019t too strong, and Choi Inseop fell to the floor.\u00a0Wooyeon swung his fists, thinking that the next manager should be chosen as someone who at least knew how to protect himself.\u00a0The Chinese guy lightly dodged Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fist.Normally, they would\u2019ve killed him off, but when the man who hit him in the back of the head was fumbling with Choi Inseop\u2019s body in the bathroom, he felt unpleasant, so he hit his groin with his foot, and that person ran up to him cursing.The guy who hit Lee Wooyeon\u2019s his head pushed him into the lake.\u00a0The sound of a splash rang out, and the men giggled in unintelligible Chinese.\u00a0The lights came on and the dog started barking, probably because he heard the noise from the neighbor next door.\u00a0The Korean-Chinese, who knew that people would soon flock, blinked at each other and began to move.\u00a0After he heard the car start, the loud Chinese language faded away.Choi Inseop, who had collapsed, ran to the lakeshore.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s figure could not be found.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon sank beneath the ice-cold lake.\u00a0He, who was hated like a thorn in his eyes, had finally disappeared from the world.\u00a0The strength in his legs was released and he did not hesitate to fall to the ground.Lee Wooyeon disappeared from the world.\u00a0Jenny\u2019s revenge was accomplished without him even touching him.\u201chaha\u2026\u00a0Hahaha\u2026\u00a0 haha\u2026 Jennie\u2026\u00a0I\u2026\u201dThere was no saying that he did it.\u00a0The bad person Lee Wooyeon, that motherfucker was punished, but he didn\u2019t even think that he had achieved Jenny\u2019s revenge.This was not revenge.\u00a0It was just an accident.He couldn\u2019t go to Jenny with the news of the accident.Choi Inseop shouted\u00a0asking for help.\u00a0He shouted out loud to send 119 or the police or anything.\u00a0The sound of people rushing could be heard in the distance.\u00a0However, Choi Inseop had an intuition that everything would be over when someone who could help came along.Yet, it was not the time.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t let Lee Wooyeon go like that.Choi Inseop took off his shoes.The second sound of a splash split the ice-cold lake water.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you going to push me?\u201dGilbert, standing by the water, asked with a grin.\u201cOh, no. I\u2026\u201dUnfortunately, Gilbert, who was playing on the water\u2019s edge, stumbled and fell to the bottom of the lake.When this unlucky Gilbert, who was making fun of him, disappeared to the bottom of the lake, he surprised Ann and he ran to the lakeshore.After hesitating for a moment, Choi Ann took off his shoes.Plop!Choi Ann, who jumped into the lake, barely swam out holding Gilbert\u2019s hand as it was settling to the bottom of the lake.\u201cHaa haa\u2026\u201dTaking a deep breath, Choi Ann looked at Gilbert.\u00a0His bluish lips show that his breathing was unusual.Ann was amazed and checked his breathing.\u00a0He was not breathing.Ann\u00a0pulled his hair back and remembered the man who made fun of him as a manager.\u00a0He also remembered Diana Jenny\u2019s crying face.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnn bit his lip and placed his on Gilbert\u2019s.He definitely knew how to do CPR.After several artificial respirations, water and cough came out of Gilbert\u2019s mouth.\u201cCough\u2014.

Manager.\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2026 I\u2026!\u201dChoi Ann struggled.\u00a0But Gilbert gave strength to the hand that was holding his hair.Choi Ann thought.Fuck you.As soon as he was discharged from the hospital, Lee Wooyeon was literally busy.\u00a0Reporters who liked to talk about his sudden hospitalization published speculative articles, but the agency announced that it was a minor fracture caused by a car accident.\u00a0Since it was a bad accident, he also had to talk with the police.The script meeting, which was supposed to start right away, was also canceled.\u00a0There was also a setback in the programming of the drama.\u00a0There was even talk of replacing with another actor, but the PD and the writer said that this role would not be possible unless it was Lee Wooyeon, and came to the hospital with a fruit basket.The doctor actually told him to rest in the hospital for a month, but after a week, Lee Wooyeon was restless and forcefully left the hospital.\u00a0Choi Inseop was destined to be busy at the same time, but he was given a special three-day vacation.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled at Inseop, who said it was okay, and did not hesitate to remark that he should not have returned alive from the bottom of the lake if he did not allow his lifesaver this small gesture.\u00a0In the end, Choi Inseop had to spend three precious days alone in the corner of his room.For absolute stability, a vacation was necessary for Inseop, who had to listen to the doctor, but for him, every minute was a waste of time.When he returned from the three-day vacation, manager Cha, who had become surprisingly skinny, grabbed his hand and asked if he was okay, whether it was really okay to work, instead of going to the hospital, and once he confirmed that Inseop was okay, he left the office saying that he was now on vacation.CEO Kim also asked him many times if he was okay.\u00a0He hesitated and replied that he was okay and not to worry.\u00a0He wanted to thank manager Cha and CEO Kim for taking care of him,\u00a0but he was worried that he might get attached to him, so he couldn\u2019t even say his greetings properly.On the way to pick up Lee Wooyeon, Choi Inseop put down his cell phone, pondering many times whether he should send a text message to the two of them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0What should I say?\u201dA bittersweet cry pierced his heart.\u00a0Inseop drove the car with his mind wandering.\u00a0Today was the day of the script reading, which was delayed due to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s injury.\u00a0CEO Kim repeatedly said that it was very important because it was the first meeting after the lead actor changed to Kang Youngmo.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who learned about the hidden story of the actor Kang Youngmo through Googling and searching, could not help but be nervous.And above all, he was terribly nervous to face Lee Wooyeon for the first time after being discharged from the hospital.\u00a0His hands holding the steering wheel were so sweaty that he had to rub his palms over his clothes several times.Choi Inseop was afraid of Lee Wooyeon.While in the hospital, he was hospitalized in the room next to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He asked to move to a 6-person room because a single room was too burdensome, but CEO Kim refused firmly.\u00a0In the end, he had no choice but to spend the whole week in a single room in a luxurious hospital.\u00a0During that time, Inseop had to face Wooyeon while wearing a patient uniform.\u00a0He would open the door of the hospital room all the time and say trivial things. Until then, it could have been said that it was an act to appease the boredom of hospital room life by making concessions, but the problem was at night.It was more terrifying than he could have imagined to experience someone looking down at him when he suddenly woke up from his sleep at night.\u00a0Each time, Inseop grabbed his heart and even wondered if that person was trying to kill him from a heart attack.\u00a0When he asked what was going on, Lee Wooyeon smiled like he was saying \u2018I know\u2019, and went back to his room.\u00a0As if nothing had happened.The next day, Lee Wooyeon did not mention anything.\u00a0At first, Choi Inseop thought he had a nightmare and passed it on, but the next day he found Lee Wooyeon standing by the bed as well.\u201cWhew\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe had to call Wooyeon and tell him that he had arrived at the parking lot, but his hand did not move.\u00a0In just a few days, he felt like a lot of bad things had happened.\u201cYou came?\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201dSuddenly, someone knocked on the car glass, and Inseop dropped his cell phone and screamed.\u00a0His heart was pounding and he had to lean on the steering wheel for a while, breathing heavily.\u201cDid I surprise you?\u00a0Sorry.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and opened the back door of the car.\u00a0As he entered the car, Inseop cleared his breath and grabbed the steering wheel.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\u201cFine.\u00a0Thanks to you, I have improved a lot.\u201d\u201cWhy are you thanking me?\u00a0I survived thanks to Mr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0All because of me\u2026\u201d\u201cThis talk was over then, so why are you saying that again?\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u201dBecause of him, Wooyeon was involved in an unsavory thing, and Inseop bowed his head and apologized as soon as he came to his senses.\u00a0Then for the first time, Wooyeon scolded him with an angry voice and told him not to talk like that again.Inseop, contemplating what to say, just quietly started the car and drove.\u00a0At this time, he felt very fortunate to be driving a car.\u00a0This was because Wooyeon seldom spoke to the manager while driving except for urgent business.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWhat urgent business did he have?He looked at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face from the rearview mirror and answered.\u201cDid you eat?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dIn response to the unexpected question, Inseop began to wonder if there was a hidden meaning that he did not know in Korean.\u201cDid you eat?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon asked again, Inseop realized that he was really asking if he had eaten.\u201cYes, a simple\u2026\u201dBefore coming here, he really simply filled up his stomach and left the house.\u00a0Eating alone was one of the things that Inseop, who had always had a noisy meal time surrounded by a large family in the United States, was not used to.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t used to Korean food yet, so it was unreasonable to cook by himself.\u00a0His meal consisted mostly of bread, salad and drinks.\u201cWhat did you just eat?\u201d\u201cToast and milk\u2026\u201dWhile driving, Choi Inseop was suddenly worried.Why was he doing that?\u00a0Why was that person like that?Even as a courtesy, Lee Wooyeon was the kind of person who never asked questions about whether he had eaten or what he ate.\u00a0Not knowing what his intentions were, Inseop\u2019s mouth was dry with anxiety.\u201cYou can\u2019t eat things like that. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not feeling well yet.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019m healthy.\u201dLaughter was heard from behind.\u00a0Inseop bit his lip, wondering if he had made another mistake.\u201cWhat time is the meeting today?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s three o\u2019clock.\u201d\u201cThen we have about an hour to spare, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u201dLee Wooyeon was famous for arriving as early as possible and waiting for people.\u00a0It was Lee Wooyeon who set the schedule to leave two hours earlier than the meeting time today.\u201cThen let\u2019s go eat.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dChoi Inseop asked as he thought he had heard it wrong.\u201cLet\u2019s go eat.\u00a0What do you like?\u201d\u201c\u2026Now, what are you saying?\u201d\u201cWe have enough time, don\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cIt is enough, but\u2026\u00a0are you okay?\u201dUsually, it was a habit for Lee Wooyeon to go early and wait, but CEO Kim said that it would be better to be early today. Although it was an accident, the script meeting and filming date were delayed because of him, which was like an unintentional nuisance to other actors. Not only CEO Kim but also Choi Inseop thought it would look good to go and wait early on a day like this.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u00a0I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Okay.\u00a0If it\u2019s like that.\u201dAlthough he was reluctant from the sudden meal offer, Choi Inseop was obedient and decided to follow him.\u201cWhat do you like to eat, Mr. Inseop?\u201d\u201cI eat anything\u2026 Except for the spicy ones.\u201dHe added the spicy part quietly.\u00a0Because of his father, he had the opportunity to eat Korean food often, but he could not enjoy spicy food at all.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s favorite Korean food, such as bulgogi, japchae, and ribs, was limited to the level that foreigners all over the world could eat.\u201cReally?\u00a0Then let\u2019s go to a good place.\u201dInseop could feel a little laughter in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice when he said that.***\u201cIt\u2019s delicious here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been here a few times.\u201dThere was nothing on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face as he said that, except for bright kindness.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at the menu board and his face alternately with a feeling of wanting to cry.\u201cOh my, who is this?\u00a0Aren\u2019t you the handsome bachelor from TV?\u201d\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cAh, I feel it every time I see you, but you\u2019re really, really, really handsome.\u00a0Your mum must be full even if she doesn\u2019t eat.\u201dThe staff who came to take the order recognized Lee Wooyeon and trembled.\u00a0He smiled with no sign of annoyance, and gave him a modest smirk.\u201cWhat would you like to eat?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0well.\u201dChoi Inseop read the menu again.\u00a0With the exception of alcohol and rice, there was no food that did not contain red pepper powder on the menu and it made him feel hopeless.\u201cThe fried octopus here is delicious.\u201d\u201c\u2026okay.\u201dWhen he looked at the seat next to him, everyone seemed to be eating it.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at the menu again with a depressed face.\u00a0He also had no other food to eat.\u201cI will order.\u00a0Here, fried octopus for two, please.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dUnable to even call the lady who took the menu, Inseop licked his lips.\u201cThey say that eating spicy food makes you feel a little better.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I see.\u201d\u201cEat and relax.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dThe Gonggibap and side dishes were served first, but among them, there was no side dish that Inseop could eat.\u00a0He scooped up some rice with chopsticks, put it in his mouth, and tried to figure out what the hell Lee Wooyeon might have meant to bring him here.What?\u00a0Why was that?\u00a0Why was he suddenly pretending to be close to him?\u2026\u00a0what did he do wrong?\u00a0Perhaps that\u2026 No, because no one had seen it.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cMr Inseop.\u00a0Sometimes you get very dazed.\u00a0You must be thinking a lot.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I will never be dazed again.\u201dInseop raised his chopsticks and looked down and answered with a straight face.\u00a0He had eyes like a child being scolded by an adult.A gentle smile appeared on the lips of Lee Wooyeon, who was looking at him.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know because they barely spoke, but now that he heard it, Choi Inseop\u2019s Korean was a mess.\u00a0It made him want to ask where he learned to speak in such a stupid manner.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you get dazed.\u00a0I was just wondering what you were thinking.\u201dHe wondered what was going on inside that little head.\u00a0If possible, he wanted to split his head off and look inside.\u201cI don\u2019t really think about anything.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t believe he was saying something like that.\u00a0He was as unreliable as a politician claiming to be honest.Lee Wooyeon drank water and smiled at his manager.From the day that the manager risked his life at the bottom of the lake to save him, Choi Inseop became the most incomprehensible human being in his head.As the two were exploring each other like that, a plate of steaming stir-fried octopus arrived.\u201cPlease eat.\u201dWooyeon recommended that Inseop eat first.\u00a0As Choi Inseop murmured while holding his chopsticks, he stretched out his hand and urged him to hurry up and grab a bite.\u201c\u2026\u00a0I will eat well.\u201dIn front of the bright red octopus stir-fry that brought tears to his eyes just looking at it, Inseop prayed inwardly.Heavenly Father, lead me not into temptation. Thank you for the daily bread.Ame\u2026n!!!Inseop\u2019s face literally turned bright red when he put a piece of stir-fried octopus in his mouth.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting on the other side, started to use chopsticks with a relaxed face.\u00a0Inseop covered his mouth with his palm and barely swallowed the fireball in his mouth.\u00a0He scooped up the rice twice with a spoon and ate it, but the fire on his tongue did not go out.\u201cIs it spicy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0yes.\u201dInseop did not even realize that he was making a short tongue pronunciation because it was so spicy.\u201cIt\u2019s only at the beginning.\u00a0If you eat it, you will be fine later.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat means, keep eating.\u201cYou were asked to go on a vacation, but you were under a lot of stress because of\u00a0 work, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0no.\u201d\u201cEating spicy food relieves a lot of stress, so come on.\u00a0Please eat.\u201dThis time, Lee Wooyeon even picked up the octopus with his chopsticks and placed it on Inseop\u2019s rice.\u00a0The big star\u2019s outrageous service meant that only the manager would die.\u201cTh, thank you.\u201dInseop put the second stir-fried octopus in his mouth.\u00a0This time, he swallowed it without chewing it.\u201cCough\u2026ugh\u2026cough\u201dHis tongue was fine, but his throat was the problem.\u00a0When something hot and spicy suddenly entered, he started coughing and even tears formed.As tears flowed from the corners of Choi Inseop\u2019s eyes, Lee Wooyeon coughed slightly.\u00a0The suggestion to have a meal with his manager was to treat a life saver with a meal from the heart of the 1% that made him a human being.\u00a0However, the moment he heard Inseop\u2019s timid addition that he can\u2019t eat spicy food, the other 99% remembered this place.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s head was still complicated.\u00a0He was wondering what the hell that fucking manager was up to.\u00a0Normally, it would be enough to kill or chase away annoying flies by hitting them with the palm of his hand, but this guy strangely aroused curiosity.Why was that fly flying around in such a strange shape?As he was thinking about it, he felt like his headache wouldn\u2019t go away.\u201cEat a lot.\u201dLee Wooyeon took a handful of stir-fried octopus and placed it on top of the rice to the odd fly that gave him a headache.Choi Inseop\u2019s face when he saw it became a tearful face.He was told that in Korean food culture, it was not polite to refuse if someone gave him a side dish, even if it did not suit his taste.\u00a0Inseop knew that it was a Korean sentiment and that he should never ignore it.\u201c\u2026\u00a0well\u2026\u00a0I will eat.\u201dLike a criminal who took the medicine, Inseop shoved the octopus and rice into his mouth while crying.\u00a0Tears streamed down from the corners of his eyes.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t until the point where he didn\u2019t know whether he was eating rice or drinking tears, Lee Wooyeon handed him a glass of water and made a sad expression.\u201cCan\u2019t you eat it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t think you can?\u201dAt the crossroads of Korean affection and death, Inseop nodded at the thought of living.\u00a0Seeing the tears flowing down his cheeks, Wooyeon couldn\u2019t help but change his mind.\u201cIt\u2019ll get better as you eat, so eat one more.\u201dAs soon as he saw Lee Wooyeon picking up an octopus with an angelic face and handing it over to him, Inseop recalled two Chinese words he studied hard before.At first glance, there was a letter that he thought was fascinating because the character for heart was attached to the words that looked similar, but it meant the opposite.Affection and poison.\u201cHere, eat.\u201dChoi Inseop dropped his head, thinking that what Lee Wooyeon handed over to him was not Korean affection, but poison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHaa\u2026\u00a0ha\u2026\u00a0haa.\u201d\u201cIs it still that spicy?\u201d\u201cSor\u2026\u00a0ry.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who found joy in the appearance of an adult man crying over and over just from eating stir-fried octopus, and did not tell him to stop eating until the end, asked that question.As soon as Choi Inseop finished eating, he apologized and ran to the bathroom to wipe his tongue with cold water, but his tongue had long since lost the pain sensation.\u00a0After leaving the restaurant and eating the vanilla ice cream that Wooyeon gave, Inseop shed tears for a long time.\u00a0Even while driving, his tongue tingled, and he made a strange breathing sound and turned the steering wheel.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dEven after saying that, Inseop drank the bottled water for a long time.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who looked at it as if it was interesting, opened his mouth.\u201cCan\u2019t you eat anything spicy?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Ah, just\u2026\u00a0\u00a0little.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you can even eat kimchi..\u201d\u201c\u2026I eat.\u00a0Some kimchi.\u201dHe barely ate Kimchi unless he washed it in water.However, Inseop did not talk about such a fact.\u00a0He just wanted to make Lee Wooyeon remember as littles facts about him.Lee Wooyeon smiled and got out of the car with the script.\u00a0Choi Inseop also quickly turned off the engine and followed him down.\u00a0Reporters started taking pictures of him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon greeted reporters politely and went inside.\u201cHello.\u00a0Forgive me for being late.\u201dAlthough he arrived about ten minutes earlier than the scheduled time, Lee Wooyeon came first and greeted the actors who were waiting for him.\u00a0Everyone warmly asked him if he was okay and had a friendly first meeting.\u2013 The prince is kind to everyone.\u00a0Treats everyone like a princess.Jenny\u2019s voice seemed to have been heard in Inseop\u2019s ear, who was watching him.\u00a0To Lee Wooyeon, who greeted each person without showing any dislike, the female actors openly expressed their affection.It was just like Lee Wooyeon.Choi Inseop, leaning against the wall, thought as he watched Lee Wooyeon sit down.\u00a0In an instant, he made the people in the conference room look at his side.\u201cWhat?\u00a0Did you just arrive??\u201dThe door to the conference room opened and a man\u2019s loud voice was heard.\u00a0It was Kang Youngmo.\u00a0With the script in hand, he found his seat and sat down with a very serious expression on his face.\u201cHello.\u00a0Nice to meet you.\u201dLee Wooyeon bowed his head and politely greeted him, but he did not even turn his head and grumbled with a frown on his face.\u201cYou make people wait for your personal reasons, are you crazy?\u00a0Wherever you are, you only believe in popularity.\u201dIt was a voice that everyone in the conference room could hear.\u00a0And if you weren\u2019t an idiot, you could tell who it was referring to.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u00a0senior.\u00a0I unintentionally caused trouble.\u201dLee Wooyeon said with his head bowed, but Kang Youngmo seemed unwilling to look at his face.\u201cWell, how do we know if it is unintentional or not?\u00a0Everyone is busy, so do we have to suffer because of your own schedules?\u201dSuddenly, the people who were beside them started to look at Kang Youngmo and Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you all doing?\u00a0Without sitting down.\u00a0Aren\u2019t you going to practice the script?\u00a0Has everyone read the script?\u00a0Did Lee Wooyeon read it too?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I read it.\u201d\u201cLee Wooyeon, when you receive a script, you\u2019ll read it just once, and you will memorize the entire script, right?\u201d\u201cI do memorize it, but I have to read it over and over again to understand.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dKang Youngmo picked up the script lying in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side and threw it in the trash.\u00a0Even the director was surprised by his sudden action and couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut.\u00a0Fortunately, the reporters hadn\u2019t been called in yet, so the incident did not leak out.\u00a0Kang Youngmo was doing something like that, but no matter how much he looked at it, Inseop felt like it went beyond the limit.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You didn\u2019t memorize it?\u00a0Then go and pick it up again.\u201dKang Youngmo pointed to the trash can behind his back.According to the information found by Choi Inseop, Kang Youngmo was insufferable and arrogant, but he did not interfere with work.\u00a0Inseop realized that most of the information he had found about Kang Youngmo was true, but some were not.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to pick it up, do you?\u00a0If that\u2019s the case, then don\u2019t lie to me in the first place.Aigoo.\u00a0I am sorry.\u201dThe director\u2019s expression darkened.\u00a0So did the other actors.\u2026\u00a0It was not to the extent that it did not interfere with work.\u00a0But he was interfering.\u00a0That too, a lot.Lee Wooyeon looked at the senior who was being sarcastic in front of him.\u00a0His eyes showed no emotion.\u00a0With a calm face, he only looked at the person named Kang Youngmo.Choi Inseop quietly approached Kang Youngmo\u2019s back.\u00a0As he bent over and tried to put his hand in the trash can, Wooyeon called out his name with a firm voice.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes?\u201d\u201cJust stay.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u201dIt was a sweet voice that seemed to melt as soon as it touched his ear, but Inseop felt the blade hidden in it and shrugged his shoulders without realizing it.\u201cBecause I memorized everything.\u201dKang Youngmo\u2019s expression became even more serious at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s added words.\u00a0But then, as if to give it a try, he gave his shoulder strength and chin.\u201cWhere do we start?\u201d\u201cDo it from the 5th.\u00a0Director, is it okay?\u201d\u201cNo, we need to understand the characters first, so I think it would be better to start with episode 1 in order\u2026\u00a0\u201dUsually, other actors also came to read the script for episode 1, so only a few people read it until episode 5.\u00a0Moreover, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t even have a script.\u00a0It was almost impossible to start by memorizing the lines of episode 5.\u201cWhy nott? Lee\u00a0Wooyeon said that he memorized everything anyway, and everyone else has a script, so why don\u2019t they read it themself?\u201dEveryone in the conference room knew that Kang Youngmo was doing that on purpose to suppress Lee Wooyeon\u2019s spirit.\u00a0The director could not step forward in haste because he knew that it would be better for peace in the future if he did not get involved in the fight for pride between the actors.Besides, Kang Youngmo was rumored to have a dirty personality, so if he took the wrong side for nothing, he would end up getting headaches over and over again.\u00a0Although the production company of this drama was the entertainment that Kang Youngmo belonged to, and although his personality was dirty, once Kang Youngmo appeared, he was able to catch the viewership ratings.\u00a0In terms of acting, he was a hard-to-find person, so even if someone worked with him and got insulted like that from behind, he always got the script.Anyway, that was a bit harsh.Everyone looked at Kang Youngmo with that expression.\u00a0But no one had the courage to speak out such a thought.\u201cI am okay.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter if others do as they please.\u201dEveryone turned their attention to the generosity that came out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u00a0In that case.\u201dA twisted ridicule hung around Kang Youngmo\u2019s lips.Choi Inseop watched him nervously from behind.\u201cWhere do we start?\u201d\u201cFrom page 14 of episode 5.\u00a0How is it?\u00a0The scene where Kim Youngha and Lee Wonsik meet at the market on the street.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0That\u2019s fine.\u201dEveryone was sitting in their seats, but no one opened their mouths hastily because they only looked at each other\u2019s eyes.\u201cThen I\u2019ll start first.\u201dKang Youngmo cleared his throat and started his own lines.\u201cThen do you think all this is wrong now?\u00a0Just because you close the door, close your ears, and don\u2019t speak up, can you count these things as non-existent?\u201dIt was an enormous volume.\u00a0Even if this work was not an orthodox historical drama, it was obvious that the vocalization should be different from that of a typical modern drama.\u00a0In this work, which dealt with the conflict between intellectuals set in the late Joseon Dynasty and the era of the enlightenment, Kang Youngmo and Lee Wooyeon were the protagonists who stood in opposition to openness and isolation of the country.Kang Youngmo\u2019s character was a scholar who studied abroad in China, and was an intellectual who argued that Joseon should change according to the flow of the times. .After finishing his line, Kang Youngmo looked at Lee Wooyeon with a triumphant expression.\u00a0The pronunciation, tone, and usage of modern dramas were very different from those of modern dramas, so it was a historical drama in which the pronunciation was twisted even when reading the script.\u00a0No matter how much he memorized the script, it was very difficult to counter the other person\u2019s lines in the absence of a script.\u201cBecause I consider it to exist, I am trying to protect it.\u00a0It is something I want to protect because it is here now, before, and in the future.\u00a0Have you ever thought about whether the forces that come in with new things are only treating us with favors?\u201dIt was a soft and mellow tone, like flowing water.\u00a0However, the power and eyes contained in the voice more than overwhelmed the audience.There was a depth in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes.\u00a0The people sitting in the conference room could see the face of a scholar who was agonizing while embracing the anxieties of the country.\u201cDon\u2019t you still understand that the world changes and we must change too?\u201d\u201cWe should discuss who is holding the reins.\u201d\u201cWe will hold it.\u00a0Knowing, studying, and tasting new things, we hold it and move forward.\u00a0You, too, must change your mind.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed.\u00a0There were no lines in the script saying that Kim Youngha should laugh, so everyone thought he was laughing because he forgot the lines.\u201cShould I change my mind?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was smiling, asked again with a dry tone.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t the noble and honest scholar\u2019s face he had just shown.\u201cShould I change my mind?\u00a0Me?\u201dA cold contempt for the other was glimpsed in the half-turned eyes.\u00a0This episode was a scene where two people who met in front of Yukjo street ministry were sharing their thoughts.\u00a0Kim Youngha, played by Lee Wooyeon, quietly refutes Lee Wonsik\u2019s thoughts from start to finish, but there was no line anywhere that he should be angry or ignore Lee Wonsik.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this at all.\u00a0I never knew the day would come when you would say that to me.\u201dThis line sounded like he was saying a monologue in a self-helpful tone with bitterness, but Lee Wooyeon laughed at Kang Youngmo with narrow eyes and seemed to speak directly to him.\u00a0Kang Youngmo\u2019s face turned red and he threw the script he was holding onto the table.\u201cAre you telling me to listen now?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLike a person waking up from a dream, Lee Wooyeon asked in surprise.\u00a0When he asked again, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Kang Youngmo began to scream.\u201cWhere is the line?\u00a0Isn\u2019t that what you said to me now?\u201d\u201cIThat\u2019s not true.\u00a0Sunbae.\u201dLee Wooyeon shook his head.\u201cIf there are any shortcomings in my acting, I will accept it as much as I can.\u00a0It was just acting, and I\u2019m sorry if I offended you.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt was acting, but Kang Youngmo was uttering the words that he was immersed in the drama to the point of being confused with reality.\u00a0Unable to do this or that, Kang Youngmo trembled with the hand holding the script and barely opened his mouth.\u201cEp 3, page 19, from the second scene again!\u201dAll the actors sitting in the conference room couldn\u2019t help but smile wryly.\u00a0In the reading of the script that followed, Wooyeon showed a perfect role without ever forgetting the lines, and gave out the spirit of lovingly telling the lines of other people who made mistakes.When reporters came in to take pictures, it was no exaggeration to say that Lee Wooyeon almost led the flow of the play.\u00a0In the end, Kang Youngmo said that he was not feeling well that day and got up from the middle and left.It was Lee Wooyeon\u2019s victory.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t say much, and I\u2019m not sick. And Kang Youngmo is kind of\u2026 I think there was a war of nerves, but he finished his script reading well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very fortunate.\u201dA loud sigh was heard from CEO Kim.\u201cYes.\u00a0Fortunately, the other actors were also worried, but nothing happened\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not sick.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon will be fine.\u00a0If Kang Youngmo had a head, he wouldn\u2019t have been very upset on the day the reporters gathered.\u00a0Of course, he would have done it in moderation.\u00a0Take good care of your body\u00a0Inseop-ah.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s heart became cold at the added friendly words.\u2018Sorry.\u00a0I don\u2019t deserve that kind of concern.\u00a0CEO.\u2019Enduring the words in his heart, Inseop bit his lip.\u201cSorry for worrying you.\u201d\u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u00a0Anyway, what are you going to do after Lee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule today?\u201d\u201cI want to rest at home.\u201d\u201cTake a break when you can.\u00a0When we start filming for the drama, there will be a lot of overnight filming and there will be no time to close your eyes.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0Then I\u2019ll get going.\u201dAfter saying goodbye, he put his phone in his pocket.\u00a0As he walked to the parking lot to pick up his car, Inseop remembered what had happened today in his head.He knew that the people on this floor had a lot of energy, but seeing it with his own eyes today, he felt like his whole body was leaking out.\u00a0Everyone could not help but admire Lee Wooyeon\u2019s ability to respond naturally no matter what page Kang Youngmo opened and whatever lines he said.\u00a0When he had a photo time after calling reporters for a while, reporters were also impressed by his acting ability to digest every scene without a single mistake.The script practice, which continued for a long time even after the reporters left, ended with Kang Youngmo leaving, but everyone sighed.It was because everyone had guessed that this was not the end, but the beginning.Inseop, who was watching the scene, clinging to the wall, shrugged his shoulders as if he was being hit whenever Kang Youngmo screamed nervously.After seeing the pale face of the manager following Kang Youngmo, he clicked his tongue and sympathized with him.If he had been Kang Youngmo\u2019s manager, he would have collapsed after not being able to hold out for even a week.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know how he was holding out.\u201cI feel tired\u2026\u201dJust being in the same room with Kang Youngmo for a while was exhausting, but the manager thought about how he felt and then shook his head in a hurry.\u00a0He was surprised to think that his situation was better than that of Kang Youngmo\u2019s manager.It couldn\u2019t be better.\u00a0Because he was just sticking with Lee Wooyeon\u2019s weakness to catch him.\u00a0It was an insult to others who were working hard.With a self-pitying smile, he walked down the road leading into the parking lot.\u00a0The moment he turned the corner, a car protruding from the side barely passed Choi Inseop.\u00a0As he reflexively stepped backwards, he lost his balance and fell to the floor.\u201cWhat!\u00a0Watch where you\u2019re going!\u201dThe man who lowered the windshield of the Audi roared fiercely.\u00a0It was Kang Youngmo.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know why he drove out of the parking lot by himself, but Inseop got up quickly and bowed his head to him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dKang Youngmo stared at Inseop\u2019s face as he gave him an apology and said, \u201cAh,\u201d and opened his mouth.\u201cAre you Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager?\u201dAfter hesitating for a while, Choi Inseop answered yes.\u00a0Even if he said no, it was best not to do anything that could be bad because they would continue to face each other in the future.\u201cIs it over now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhy are you talking like that?\u00a0Do you think I\u2019m\u00a0 a senior soldier in the army?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201dHe didn\u2019t understand the intention of the other person, but he apologized first.\u201cAs a manager to Lee Wooyeon, you\u2019re very disciplined.\u00a0Hahaha.\u201dInseop wanted to get out of there immediately.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know what Kang Youngmo would do to him, so sweat was dripping down his palms.\u00a0When he fell, he landed on his hand incorrectly and his palms began to feel sore as if he had a wound.\u201cOkay. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u00a0Nice to meet you.\u00a0I\u2019m a little thirsty, can you go and get me a Coke?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want you to get me a Coke.\u00a0Please do me a favor.\u201dChoi Inseop looked around to see if it was right for him to run an errand for him.\u00a0Kang Youngmo\u2019s manager, who should have been there, was not in the car.\u201cMy manager went first because he had work.\u00a0Please listen to my request.\u00a0I can\u2019t just walk around recklessly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInseop was worried.Lee Wooyeon, who was talking with reporters, had implied to him to bring the car to the entrance as soon as possible.\u201cWhy?\u00a0busy?\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager isn\u2019t Lee Wooyeon, but he seems very busy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll buy it for you.\u201dAt Choi Inseop\u2019s answer, Kang Youngmo, who had been sarcastic until recently, said okay and smiled.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face frowned as he went up the parking lot again and even said a thank-you afterward.He can\u2019t help it though.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t create his own problems.Be quiet, then quietly disappear.That was Choi Inseop\u2019s current goal.\u00a0The doctor\u2019s words came to mind that he should not run for a while and refrain from strenuous exercise so as not to strain his heart, but he could not walk leisurely.Recalling that there was a drink vending machine inside the building, he quickly ran towards it.\u201cThere!\u201dWhen he found a red vending machine, he quickly rummaged through his pocket and took out a bill.\u00a0He was nervously pushing the banknotes back in again and again because it didn\u2019t fit the machine. When the lights on the vending machine finally came on, he hurrahed inside.He had to do it quickly, quickly, quickly.Choi Inseop scanned the Coke with his hand and muttered the word \u201cquickly\u201d.\u00a0However, while he was contemplating whether to choose Coke or Pepsi, someone reached out and put an end to his worries.\u201cThank you.\u00a0I was thirsty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0uh.\u201dLee Wooyeon bent over and took out the drink that came out from below and smiled.\u201cThis is what I promoted.\u00a0Drinking in front of reporters would be good for advertising.\u00a0There is talk of renewing the contract.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0 Yes.\u201dChoi Inseop took the money out of his pocket again and carefully pushed it into the vending machine.\u00a0Seeing him pull out a Coke and put it in his pocket, Wooyeon made a puzzled face.\u201cDo you want a cola?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0just\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWhen you are thirsty, it is better to drink bottled water.\u00a0Ion drinks are fine, but bottled water is better.\u00a0It puts less strain on the body.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u00a0I\u2019ll bring the car right away.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0Let\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI was just about to come down anyway.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop, who was late, went to the lobby of the building and did not return, Lee Wooyeon was starting to get annoyed.\u00a0Even though he looked stupid, Choi Inseop time management was as sharp as a knife.\u00a0Wanting to see how long the knife had already become dull, Lee Wooyeon checked his watch.\u00a0Choi Inseop rushed into the building, making the\u00a0 reporter\u2019s laugh with a sarcastic remark that he must have had an important appointment.It was strange.\u00a0He hadn\u2019t seen Choi Inseop running in a while.\u00a0When it rained, he only widened his stride while making a puzzled expression.\u00a0Running inside like that, he must have had some reason, Lee Wooyeon said goodbye to the reporters and followed Inseop.The moment he found Choi Inseop, who was looking crazy while choosing a drink in front of the vending machine, Lee Wooyeon clenched his fists.Instead of scratching the back of his head, Lee Wooyeon quietly approached his back and pressed a random button to bring out his drink.\u201cGo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dSeeing Choi Inseop, who was murmuring and watching, following behind, Lee Wooyeon inquired.\u201cWhy are you so late?\u00a0I was waiting for you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dChoi Inseop never made excuses for his mistakes.\u00a0He just quietly admitted his mistake and offered an apology.\u00a0It felt neat at first, but now it was annoying.Lee Wooyeon asked again.\u201cWhat happened?\u00a0I wonder if you were meeting someone while I was standing there?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was a joke, but Choi Inseop bowed his head and didn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon turned the bottle cap of the drink he was holding.While drinking the drink that opened with a click, Lee Wooyeon waited for Choi Inseop\u2019s answer.\u201c\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop did not say anything until the end and quietly followed him.\u00a0Gradually, his stomach twisted.\u00a0The thought of not knowing what kind of seed was being planted behind the innocent face of not knowing anything, the suppressed irritation began to grow.It made him want to twist his slender neck and scream at that tiny head to tell him right away what he was thinking.Lee Wooyeon, who was walking ahead, turned around.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dWhen their eyes met, Choi Inseop\u2019s eyes widened even more.\u00a0It was heinous to have such innocent eyes on a person that lied and\u00a0 tried to deceive people.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon spoke like a child.\u201cPeople have a lot of problems here.\u00a0You take good care of yourself, but it\u2019s not a bad thing to be careful.\u201d\u201c\u2026all right.\u201dHe didn\u2019t quite understand what Lee Wooyeon was talking about, but he thought he was telling him to be careful, so Inseop blinked his eyes and answered that.\u201cDid you understand what I mean?\u201d\u201cYou mean beware of people, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Okay.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dEven after hearing his answer, Lee Wooyeon did not feel relieved.As he entered the parking lot, Choi Inseop\u2019s signs of restlessness became clearer.\u00a0The way he looked around made it clear that he was looking for someone.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon was annoyed.If he was going to deceive people, either make it look plausible, or don\u2019t deceive.\u00a0He was about to ask what the hell he was doing.\u00a0That was when the silver Audi started flashing its headlights fiercely.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon covered his face with his hand at the headlight that was so bright that he could not see ahead, and checked who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat.Kang Youngmo was leaning on the steering wheel and looking at him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked back at Choi Inseop.\u00a0Seeing Inseop trying to get a drink out of his pocket, he knew at a glance what was going on.Lee Wooyeon took Choi Inseop\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cStay still.\u201dHe held Inseop\u2019s hand and made him put it back into his pocket.\u00a0Then, dragging Inseop as it was, he went to the side of Kang Youngmo\u2019s car.\u201cAre you leaving now?\u201d\u201cOh yeah.\u00a0I\u2019ve got some business to do.\u00a0But the manager there\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop tried to get the Coke out of his pocket, but Lee Wooyeon held his wrist and did not let go.\u201cWe are busy, so let\u2019s go.\u00a0Goodbye.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Wait a minute.\u00a0Are you ignoring what I asked earlier?\u201dThe atmosphere became harsh.Inseop hated rebellion.\u00a0Of course, it was physically painful, but not wanting to be in a difficult situation mentally also played a big part in avoiding the group that bullied him to death at the school he sometimes went to.Choi Inseop liked peaceful times.\u00a0He loved the time he spent sitting in bed and imagining pleasant thoughts alone.\u00a0He longed for quiet peace and pursued friendly human relationships.\u00a0However, after coming to this place, he was on the verge of shriveling due to the harsh situations he unintentionally encountered.He just wanted to give the Coke and leave quickly.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon, who was holding his wrist tightly, didn\u2019t seem to want to do that.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI told your manager to buy me a Coke, but you\u2019re going now?\u201d\u201cOh, we are.\u00a0Our manager was busy, so it must have been forgotten, sunbae.\u201dHaving said that, Lee Wooyeon held out the drink he was holding and held it in front of Kang Youngmo.\u201cThen, would you like to have this instead?\u201d\u201c\u2026You.\u00a0This\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop was able to see with his own eyes twice today how the color of a human face can change.\u201cOr if you go out in front, there is a convenience store, so it would be good to buy bottled water.\u00a0It\u2019s better for your health than these drinks, sunbae.\u201dLee Wooyeon greeted him politely and grabbed Choi Inseop\u2019s hand again.\u00a0Frightened of Kang Youngmo, who was staring at him, Inseop looked back several times.\u201cDon\u2019t look back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dThe two walked to the place where the car was parked.\u00a0In front of the car, Inseop began to think about how to remove himself out Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand that was still in his pocket.\u201cDid that person ask you to run an errand?\u201d\u201c\u2026sorry.\u201dIn any case, he thought that he should apologize because he was the one who caused this situation.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon did not accept the apology.\u201cDon\u2019t do it. From now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, things may get a little worse, but Choi Inseop is my manager, not that person.\u00a0Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dHe thought it was not enough to answer like that, so Inseop added, \u201cI will never do that again.\u201d\u00a0After hearing that, Lee Wooyeon smiled brightly.\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201dInseop carefully opened his mouth, looking at the hands in his pockets that were still not let go.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHand\u2026\u201d\u201cAh.\u00a0Right.\u201dLee Wooyeon took his hand out of his pocket.\u00a0Holding Choi Inseop\u2019s wrist.\u201cI\u2019m going to throw this away.\u201dLee Wooyeon took the Coke from his hand and threw it into a nearby trash can.\u00a0In that decisive action, Inseop felt a chill of unknown reason.His grandma used to say that people who casually threw away food were bad people\u2026 And so, Lee Wooyeon was clearly a bad guy.\u201cWhy happened here?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDid you fall?\u201dLee Wooyeon looked at Choi Inseop\u2019s palm and asked.\u00a0Inseop hid his hands behind his back and responded bluntly saying, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing.\u00a0Where did you fall?\u201d\u201cI fell in parking lot.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder and made him turn around.\u201cYou fell backwards.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s face turned red and he brushed off the dust on his buttocks.\u00a0It was rare to fall backwards on a non-icy road.\u00a0Unless something threatens in front of you.Lee Wooyeon remembered the silver Audi, which was parked on the corner and was waiting for Inseop.\u201cHahaha, really\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dInseop, who was opening the car door, turned his head in surprise.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, with his usual face, said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d and got into the car.As he sat in the driver\u2019s seat and closed the car door, Choi Inseop tilted his head.\u00a0Obviously he didn\u2019t hear it wrong before, or it sounds like\u2026\u201cI\u2019m going to work out today, so please go there.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dChoi Inseop played a CD where only Lee Wooyeon\u2019s favorite songs were sung.\u00a0The sound of starting the car was drowned out by the prelude to the song.As he turned the wheel, Inseop began to ponder what exactly the words he had heard earlier meant.\u2018Fucking dog.\u00a0He said fucking dog didn\u2019t he?Did he mean a dog chewing sound?\u00a0It was a bad word since he said dog, right?\u2019A car with a handful of his worries slowly began to slide out of the parking lot.The manager, who had come from a honey-like vacation, had two medicines in his hand.\u00a0Since this was the last time, CEO Kim said that this would never happen again, held onto his pants and begged, and so he served as Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager for only a week.The results were horrendous.He felt like his whole body was weakened just by suffering from Lee Wooyeon for a few days.\u00a0When he remembered the face of Inseop when he was getting his herbal medicines, he unknowingly asked for another set.It wasn\u2019t that the other managers who had passed by were not pitiful either.\u00a0However, his heart was especially drawn to Choi Inseop.\u00a0It was pitiful that he did not know the devilish Lee Wooyeon\u2019s true form and jumped into the ice-cold bottom of the lake to save him, and that he was put back to work after lying in the hospital because of it.Besides, what does it mean to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fan?\u00a0Tears filled his eyes as he watched him running around with reduced sleep time for such a gutter-like guy.\u201cThe older I get, the more tears I shed\u2026\u201dManager Cha wiped his eyes with his palm and waited for the elevator.\u00a0Today was Monday, so Inseop would come to the office.\u00a0Usually, he received and checked the new schedule by phone or email, but Inseop personally came to the office and checked Lee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule update.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cOh, Mr. Inseop.\u00a0Are you all right?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m fine\u201dHe replied that he was okay, but his face still looked weak.\u00a0While riding the elevator, Inseop stood silently in the corner and watched only the numbers on the instrument panel change.When he heard a ding and the elevator door opened, Choi Inseop\u2019s face turned red and the manager felt bitter.\u00a0He had a nice and kind personality, but strangely, Inseop often drew a line towards people.As he entered the office, he saw Choi Inseop walking around, greeting people one by one.\u00a0Even though he was busy, he thought it was strange to see the lady who was cleaning the house bowing his head to say hello.\u201cOh.\u00a0Did you finally come to work?\u201dToday, CEO Kim, who had been admiring himself from head to toe, warmly patted him on the shoulder.\u201cHello.\u201dInseop, who saw him, bowed his head towards him.\u201cSeop.\u00a0Let me see you for a second.\u201dCEO Kim called Inseop to his room.\u00a0Manager Cha followed after him without a word.As Inseop entered, CEO Kim motioned for him to sit on the sofa.\u00a0An anxious expression was evident on Inseop\u2019s expression as he sat on the sofa.\u201cEvery time I called you, you trembled like a criminal.\u00a0I won\u2019t eat you.\u201dCEO Kim took out a drink from the refrigerator and continued.\u201cHow is Lee Wooyeon these days?\u201d\u201cHe is busy.\u00a0Interviews keep coming in, and we are preparing for filming.\u00a0He is constantly training and practicing.\u00a0Today, he has two interviews, one to participate in a movie premiere, and he has plans to appear in an entertainment program.\u201dTaking out a schedule notebook from his pocket, Inseop calmly explained Lee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule.\u00a0CEO Kim couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter and tilted his head back.\u201cAhaha.\u00a0What I asked is how Lee Wooyeon is these days.\u00a0You don\u2019t have to be so precise.\u201d\u201cYes?\u00a0Oh, sorry.\u201dHe could communicate freely, but it was still difficult for him to grasp the lines or hidden meanings of a conversation.\u201cThen what are your plans for tonight?\u201d\u201cMr. Wooyeon is going to go home at 10 o\u2019clock tonight.\u201d\u201cNo, not Lee Wooyeon, you, Inseop.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m going home.\u201d\u201cThen stop by the office before you go home.\u00a0Understand?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dCEO Kim liked this part of Choi Inseop.\u00a0When a superior asked him to do something, he accepted everything without asking why.\u00a0He seemed to think that was the manager\u2019s duty.\u201cThen do your best today.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Thank you.\u201dChoi Inseop stood up from his seat with an uneasy face.\u00a0The relaxed expression continued until Manager Cha called him to a stop.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes?\u201dEven though he had only called his name, when he looked at him with frightened eyes, Manager Cha felt even sadder.\u201cDrink this.\u201dHe handed out the medicine he had brought from the health center earlier.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cRemedy.\u00a0Your body looked a little weak, so I bought you one of mine.\u201d\u201cMine?\u00a0What about me?\u201dWhen CEO Kim intervened without fail, manager Cha made an outright annoyed expression.\u00a0What the hell, this annoying human, the words soared up to the top of his throat.\u201cThe CEO should buy with his own money.\u00a0A person must have a conscience.\u201d\u201cWhat did I do!\u00a0Isn\u2019t my money money?\u201d\u201cThen my money is not money!?\u201dBetween the two of them, Inseop pulled out his wallet.\u201cHow much is it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow much can I give you?\u201dChoi Inseop checked the cash in his wallet and turned a slightly dark expression.\u00a0He was worried because he could not estimate how expensive the supplement would be.\u201cWait a minute and I\u2019ll go down and get some more cash\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u00a0Who wants money.\u00a0I\u2019m just giving.\u201d\u201cWhta?\u201d\u201cEat it, because it\u2019s just something I got for you while getting mine.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0I\u2026\u201dInseop bowed his head.\u00a0He was very grateful for the goodwill of Manager Cha, but he felt that he did not deserve this kind of thing.\u201c\u2026I am okay.\u00a0I am healthy.\u201d\u201cYou eat to be healthier.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u00a0Just take it.\u201dManager Cha held out a box of medicines.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s head bowed even more.\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cTake it.\u00a0When I give something like this, you just take it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0Don\u2019t embarrass the giver, take it.\u201dWhen Manager Cha and CEO Kim alternately told him to take it, Inseop reluctantly received the box.\u00a0As he said thank you, his face turned red with embarrassment.\u201cIt was made in a good place, so eat it thoroughly.\u00a0You can eat it 30 minutes after eating.\u00a0Eat it warm as much as possible.\u201dInseop said thank you again in a small voice.\u00a0But his expression was still dark.\u201cLet\u2019s eat this and do our best to take care of Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Fighting.\u201dWhen CEO Kim struggled and shouted fighting with a bright voice, Choi Inseop shouted fighting with a lifeless voice.\u00a0As he went out with the medicine, manager Cha shrugged his shoulders.\u201cDid you do anything wrong to him?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0That can\u2019t be.\u201d\u201cThen why was he taking the medicine with such a depressed expression and leaving?\u00a0I don\u2019t think Lee Wooyeon ordered anything to put in there, right?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy!\u00a0Am I the kind of person to do what Lee Wooyeon asks?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d\u201cI did it because he was pitiful, because he was pitiful.\u00a0He\u2019s a fan of the dog-like Lee Wooyeon, and it\u2019s pitiful for him to take care of Wooyeon so much that his face is like that, so I made medicine for him.\u00a0The CEO has never been Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, so you\u2019re just talking like that.\u201d\u201cI have no intention of taking Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side, but \u2026\u00a0Not one of the kids who quit said it was difficult.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because Lee Wooyeon is cleverly crafting something.\u00a0If you don\u2019t believe me, try to be a manager for one day.\u00a0How it burns people up!\u201dManager Cha, who followed Lee Wooyeon as a manager for the past week, started to think that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s personality was like a dog.\u00a0He felt sorry for Inseop, who was working hard without knowing anything.\u00a0Of course, he also wanted him to never quit.\u201cAnyway, the CEO also wants Choi Inseop to take good care of him.\u00a0If he quits, it will be difficult to find another person, but there is still a lot of talk about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager changing frequently.\u201d\u201cI know.\u00a0I know.\u00a0I also won\u2019t let Choi Inseop go.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry.\u00a0I have everything prepared.\u201d\u201cDid you prepare something?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201dAfter leaving CEO Kim\u2019s meaningful smile behind, manager Cha left the representative office clicking his tongue.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext

are you eating?\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dChoi Inseop, who was sitting in the car and drinking the medicine with a straw, turned his head in surprise.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who had already finished filming, was tapping the car glass with his finger.\u201cOh, are you here?\u201dChoi Inseop lowered the glass.\u201cWhat are you eating?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a medicine.\u201d\u201cDo you take something like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0The manager gave it to me at the office today.\u201dAs he spoke, Inseop was choked up by the fact that he was not worthy of such kindness.After receiving the precious medicine, Inseop stood outside the office holding the medicine box for a while, with a grateful, but a sorry heart.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t do it because he was afraid he would look too spoiled if he returned it to manager Cha, and when he ate it, he felt like he was stabbed in his conscience and couldn\u2019t swallow it.\u00a0Even so, he couldn\u2019t throw away that precious thing.In the end, Choi Inseop, who had been hanging around with a medicine box outside the office for 30 minutes, received the medicine as a gift and changed his mind that one day he had to pay back to Manager Cha.\u00a0Of course, in his notebook, he wrote it down three times with a bright red ballpoint pen saying that he had to repay Manager Cha.\u201cThe Manager?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon opened the passenger seat door and got inside.\u00a0The Benz, which he always rode, had a problem and he was driving the car he borrowed from the office today.\u00a0However, Inseop couldn\u2019t help but panic when Lee Wooyeon got in the passenger seat without hesitation.Inseop watched with anxious eyes as he pushed the medicine box placed on the passenger seat to the back seat.\u201cWhat?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who felt the gaze, asked.\u201cAren\u2019t you sitting in the back seat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dUnable to say that he wasn\u2019t okay, Inseop put the medicine he was drinking back into his mouth and started sucking on the side.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who watched the round cheeks fluttering and moving, said with a smile.\u201cYou\u2019re eating well\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Because I received it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really like the black goat or soft shell turtle ones.\u00a0Other medicines are fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0What?\u201dChoi Inseop raised his eyes and asked if he had misunderstood.\u00a0There was confusion as to whether the black goat and soft shelled turtle mentioned by Lee Wooyeon were the words he knew.\u201cI didn\u2019t take it well.\u00a0Well, I\u2019ve never run out of stamina to eat medicine.\u201d\u201cNo, not that.\u00a0What do you not take well?\u201d\u201cThe black goat and turtle.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop looked down at the plastic pack of medicine he was drinking.\u00a0There, with the blazing sun in the background, was a humorous picture of a black goat and Soft shell turtle holding each other\u2019s shoulders.The dark brown liquid in Choi Inseop\u2019s mouth dripped down.\u00a0After feeling the hot liquid dripping down the nape of his neck, he came to his senses and quickly took out a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his lips.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dFortunately, the car seat was unharmed.\u00a0He wiped the medicine from his mouth with a handkerchief and apologized again to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was smiling with his eyes bent, asked.\u201cThen, did you know what you were eating?\u201d\u201c\u2026Medicine.\u201d\u201cI guess you didn\u2019t think about what type of medicine it is.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dManager Cha\u00a0 had vaguely said that it contained oriental mysterious medicines that were good for the body, but Inseop had never thought deeply about them.\u201cBlack goats are good for your health.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0eh\u2026\u201dInseop, who remembered an image of a black goat in his head, covered his mouth with his hand and grimaced.\u00a0The corners of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes gradually curved softly.\u201cIf the manager had done it, one animal would have properly been used.\u00a0One black goat, one soft shell turtle.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u00a0That one black goat becomes this kind of liquid.\u201dThe more Lee Wooyeon spoke, the more Inseop\u2019s expression became distorted.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pretended not to notice it and continued talking.\u201cBecause the turtle is boiled thoroughly, it will be good for physical recovery.\u00a0Take good care of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInseop, who was holding the medicine bag that had not yet been emptied, looked like someone who had received poison.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon gestured to him to finish up, Choi Inseop\u2019s eyes quickly turned red.Just a black goat was enough, but a turtle.However, he could not throw away the expensive medicine he received as a gift in front of Lee Wooyeon.He can do it.\u00a0He can do it.\u00a0He\u2019d done more than this, just a Black Goat and a turtle were no big deal..Choi Inseop closed his eyes tightly and poured the remaining medicine in the pack in one mouthful. It felt as if the turtle and the black goat were dancing together in his mouth, but he remembered Jenny and swallowed the rest of the medicine.He felt like he was going to vomit, but he struggled to endure it and started the car.\u00a0He was already worried that Lee Wooyeon was next to him, but he was careful to even breathe because it felt like a disgusting smell would come from his mouth.\u201cThree times a day.\u00a030 minutes before meals.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon read aloud the words written on the pouch of the medicine, Inseop shuddered and shook his shoulders.\u201cEat well.\u00a0You have to take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 thank you.\u201dChoi Inseop answered in a melancholy voice, not at all thankful.\u00a0Even when he emptied one bag, he made a sound as if he was dying, and Lee Wooyeon wondered if Inseop would be able to eat all the medicines in that box.\u00a0He felt good at the thought that he had something to check after every meal.While turning the steering wheel, Inseop continued to glance at Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting next to him.\u00a0As usual, Lee Wooyeon was reading the script with his head on the window, holding the script in one hand.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous if you don\u2019t focus on driving and glance at me like that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon turned the script back one page.\u00a0Beside the lines, the phrases he wrote with a pen were densely written.\u00a0Seeing that, CEO Kim used to say it was inappropriate sincerity.\u00a0However, it was an unavoidable task for Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0In order to act properly, he had to understand the emotional lines between the people around him, and that was more difficult for Lee Wooyeon than other people.Knowing why people were angry and in a good mood, and acting it out, was the difference.When the signal was red, Inseop glanced at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s profile as he was reading the script.\u201cYou like it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0What?\u201d\u201cIs it so good to have the celebrity you admire right next to you?\u00a0Aren\u2019t you looking at me too much?\u201dLee Wooyeon covered the script.\u00a0It was hard to tell if he was joking or being sincere.\u00a0Choi Inseop gave strength to the hand that was holding the handle.Don\u2019t overdo it, just say it naturally.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u201cInteresting?\u201d\u201cYes. I was watching from afar, but now you\u2019re so close\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie.Inseop always watched Lee Wooyeon from afar.\u00a0He thought he was from another world.\u00a0He never thought he\u2019d be able to have a conversation like this.At that time.\u201cPeter!\u201dExcitedly, Jenny ran into the room.\u00a0Peter closed the notebook he was writing in.\u201cWhat?\u00a0What were you writing?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dKnowing that Peter had a habit of taking notes of useless things all the time, Jenny started talking about herself without asking any more questions.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come see the prince?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Prince?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Today is the day of the practice match.\u00a0Let\u2019s go see him right now.\u201d\u201cNow?\u00a0Right now?\u201dPeter frowned as if worried.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even wash his hair, so he stretched his hair out, and there were things that had to be finished by tomorrow.\u00a0Instead of going to school, Peter always gave himself homework and was tested by his mother.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You just need to change clothes and go out.\u201d\u201cMy hair\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u00a0It\u2019s lovely.\u201dJenny pushed Peter on the back and urged him to quickly change his clothes.\u00a0Peter had no choice but to wash his face and change his clothes before leaving.\u00a0Jenny\u2019s cheeks were flushed with excitement.\u00a0Her face quickly turned red.\u00a0It was to the point that he wondered if it wasn\u2019t hypothyroidism.\u00a0Seeing that, the girls in the same class made fun of Jenny as a stupid pig.\u00a0Jenny didn\u2019t care.\u00a0No, she pretended not to care.\u00a0Peter felt sorry for her.\u00a0He told her that whenever she blushed, her face was dyed rosy.\u00a0Then she smiled broadly.\u00a0Peter liked seeing Jenny smiling.With a face even more red than usual, Jenny grabbed Peter.\u00a0The hot weather made her sweat a lot, and Peter had a hard time breathing too.\u201cWait, wait\u2026\u201d\u201cYou just have to go a little bit further.\u00a0Quickly.\u00a0If you don\u2019t go now, there won\u2019t be a seat in front.\u00a0There are always swarms of bees on the fence on the day the prince appears in the game.\u201d\u201cAfter a little rest\u2026\u00a0ha\u2026\u201dHe opened his mouth wide and tried to breathe in, but his lungs were still hurting and his heart was pounding.\u00a0Jenny kept tumbling about to get a good spot.\u201cHurry up, Peter, quickly\u2026\u00a0\u00a0uh\u2026\u201dShe stopped talking with her mouth open.\u00a0Peter noticed that Jenny\u2019s gaze stopped behind his back and turned his head.A group of men passed by him.\u00a0Peter could recognize at a glance who the prince Jenny was talking about.\u00a0A man with shoulders that were not inferior to those of Westerners due to genetic differences in physique caught Peter\u2019s eyes.Quarterback shoulder.The man with the shoulder that Jenny always spoke of walked across the street.\u00a0He had the same black hair and black eyes as you, but it was a completely different feeling.As he passed by, Peter unknowingly stared at his back as he walked away.\u00a0He compared himself with him on a scale of one to ten.\u00a0No, it was impossible to even compare.\u00a0He was living in another world.In Peter\u2019s eyes, the prince was not a person in the world he lived in.\u201c\u2026\u00a0changed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe signal has changed.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201dInseop, who was lost in thought for a moment, quickly stepped on the accelerator.\u201cIt\u2019s really weird\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cUsually, you seem very calm and meticulous, but sometimes you are sloppy.\u00a0Which is the real you?\u201dHis stomach churned.\u00a0The black goat medicine he drank earlier now felt like it was dancing in its stomach.\u00a0Inseop was trying to pretend to be calm.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0Everyone has a hidden side to some degree.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dInseop, who was caught in the red light of the traffic light, thought that it would be better for him to pay attention to his driving.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t the first time he had driven with Lee Wooyeon, but it was the first time he sat next to him.\u00a0It bothered him.\u00a0He was not used to it.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know what would come out from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth, so the hand holding the steering wheel was sweaty.For some reason, Lee Wooyeon covered the script he was reading and leaned against the seat to look at Inseop.\u00a0Feeling the pressure of having to say something, Choi Inseop started saying what came to mind.\u201cYou have two magazine interviews today.\u00a0You have to have a movie premiere, and you have to do a dating program interview late in the evening.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThere was nothing more to talk about.Lee Wooyeon moaned as if he was enjoying it and looked at the manager\u2019s face who was looking for something to talk about.\u201cI gathered everything related to the interview and put it in a file.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I will read it.\u201d\u201cI have prepared the clothes to wear to the premiere.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t stand it anymore..He couldn\u2019t have a conversation with Lee Wooyeon unless it was a work-related topic.\u00a0In the end, Choi Inseop grabbed the steering wheel and looked only at the windshield with his eyes wide open.He felt like he was going crazy from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s gaze that was on his cheek.\u00a0According to the original plan, he was the one making the observation, but today the situation had been reversed.\u00a0Inseop had to constantly moisten his chapped lips with his tongue because his lips were dry.\u201cTurn left.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou should have turned left here.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 sorry.\u201dHe missed the timing to change lanes because he was concerned about Lee Wooyeon sitting next to him.\u201cYou can\u2019t make a U-turn in front of this, so you\u2019ll have to cross the signal and make a T-turn.\u00a0You have plenty of time, so don\u2019t worry too much.\u201dThere were many celebrities who swore at their managers if they even took a wrong turn.\u00a0If Lee Wooyeon\u2019s attitude was any better, he would be in a good position.\u00a0However, the problem was not Lee Wooyeon\u2019s tone or attitude.\u201cIs there something on my face?\u201dInseop, who received Lee Wooyeon\u2019s gaze for about ten minutes, couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and asked.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut when it was his turn to ask why he was looking at him like that, Inseop kept his mouth shut.\u00a0It seemed that it would be seen as excessive self-consciousness for a man himself to speak like that.\u201cWhere will you be for the interview today?\u201d\u201cI will be in the car.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that, sit next to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy was he doing this to him today?Swallowing what he wanted to say, Choi Inseop slowly turned the steering wheel.\u201cI think today\u2019s interview is going to be long.\u00a0It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re alone in the car.\u2019\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then I will be nearby.\u201dIt had been a long time since he had thought that he could get any information about Lee Wooyeon from an interview.\u00a0Although Lee Wooyeon gave a favorable interview, he was not an actor who gave interesting interviews.\u00a0Inseop, who watched the interview in which only words were changed appropriately within a set frame, came to the conclusion that it would be better to get enough sleep during that time.Someone like reporter Kim Haeshin, who interviewed him before, should appear.\u00a0The reporters who decided to interview today were only entertainment reporters who were rumored to be polite.A long and tedious interview was expected.\u00a0Inseop sighed.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou were sighing now.\u00a0What are you worried about?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0Nothing.\u201dIf he was worried, it was that he couldn\u2019t find any flaws in Lee Wooyeon, but the only thing was that time was passing.\u00a0A month had already passed.\u201cI will do whatever I can to help.\u201dAll he wanted was his dirty nature.\u00a0Even if he asked for it, he would never give it to him\u2026\u201cThank you for your words.\u201dWhen the hard answer came, Lee Wooyeon smiled and leaned back.\u00a0He tried to pretend to be blunt, but he could feel how tense Inseop was with his whole body.It felt like he was watching a boy general trembling while wearing hard armor.\u00a0What kind of expression would he make if he took off all that armor?While thinking about various things, Lee Wooyeon watched Inseop\u2019s side view as he was driving.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dChoi Inseop stopped the car.\u201cThen I will go first.\u00a0Park and come up.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dHe dropped off Lee Wooyeon first, and Inseop went to the parking lot.\u00a0The car was smaller than the van he usually drove, so parking was easy.\u00a0Someone grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled him out of the car.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWooyeon oppa by chance, is he having an interview here today?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u201dThere were many fans who followed after their favorite star.\u00a0One of the manager\u2019s jobs was to control them well.\u00a0However, there were bound to be people who were out of control.\u00a0Inseop noticed that the woman in front of him was the fan who had previously poured coffee on him.\u00a0Even Lee Wooyeon, who didn\u2019t have a hard time expressing himself in front of fans, turned his head when this woman appeared.\u00a0The woman did not give in to that, but suddenly appeared and yelled at Lee Wooyeon to look at her.\u00a0In addition to that, how did she even find out the information of an unofficial interview location or filming location.\u201cCan you give him this?\u201dThe woman held out the envelope.\u00a0Choi Inseop hesitated for a moment.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon adhered to the principle of not accepting gifts from fans.\u201cA letter is fine.\u201dAs if she knew why Inseop was hesitating, the woman smiled as she held out the letter.Well,\u00a0a letter would be fine.\u201cAll right.\u201dChoi Inseop took the letter and put it in his pocket.\u00a0He bowed his head to the woman and left the parking lot.\u00a0When he entered the French restaurant on the second floor, Wooyeon, who was seated, gestured to him.After bowing to the reporter, Inseop sat down at the table next to him.\u00a0The interview continued on the other side.\u00a0Boring stories about new dramas and acting philosophies came and went.\u00a0Inseop opened the book he had brought and began to read.\u00a0Sleeping or reading books in his spare time were the greatest luxuries he could enjoy today.Once he kept his promise to Jenny, he would be able to do whatever he wanted to do.\u00a0He will be able to enjoy those moments without guilt, where he can write, travel, take pictures, read books, and fantasize to his heart\u2019s content.\u2026Will the day ever come when he would be free from guilt?\u201cI\u2019ll be away for a while.\u201dLee Wooyeon apologized to the reporter and stood up.\u00a0Inseop followed his back with his eyes, then turned his gaze back to the book.\u201cWhat book are you reading?\u00a0Is it a novel?\u201dThe reporter spoke to Inseop, wondering if the waiting time was boring.\u00a0Inseop quietly picked up the book he was reading and showed the title.\u201cThis book will save your life?\u00a0What kind of life saving story is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a novel.\u201d\u201cIs it fun?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Until now.\u201d\u201cOh right.\u00a0I\u2019m late to introduce myself.\u00a0I\u2019m Yoon Ahreum, a reporter for Monthly Blue.\u201d\u201cI am Choi Inseop.\u00a0I am Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u201dThe reporter with her hair neatly tied back handed her business card to Inseop.\u00a0Inseop didn\u2019t have a business card to give, so he hesitated for a moment, then wrote his name and cell phone number in the corner of a paper and handed it to her.\u201cSorry.\u00a0I haven\u2019t made a business card yet.\u201dHe had no intention of ever making it.Reporter Yoon Ahreum, who took the paper, said, \u201cOh,\u201d and looked at the other person\u2019s serious expression and burst into laughter.\u201cOkay.\u00a0I\u2019m going to use it really well.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Ah\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dHe wondered what mistake he had made again, but he didn\u2019t have time to ask about it.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who had gone to the bathroom, returned.\u201cWhat interesting things were you two talking about?\u201dOf course, Inseop was going to answer it was nothing.\u00a0However, Yoon Ahreum spoke first.\u201cLee Wooyeon\u2019s manager gave me his phone number.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201d\u201cI gave him a business card and he gave me his phone number.\u201dReporter Yoon Ahreum smiled as she waved the paper that was handed to her earlier.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked back at Inseop with a slightly stiff expression.\u00a0Choi Inseop waved his hands to express his denial, but the paper in her hand clearly had his name and phone number written on it.\u201cI don\u2019t have a business card, so\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u201dLee Wooyeon interrupted Choi Inseop\u2019s words.\u00a0Inseop wanted to make an excuse that it wasn\u2019t like that, but he couldn\u2019t intervene in the interview.Hearing the two of them having a conversation again, Inseop opened the book.\u00a0He read the text, but he understood nothing.\u00a0In the end, he had to close the book without even going over 30 pages in the two hours.\u201cThanks for the interview.\u201d\u201cI am very grateful.\u00a0It was a great time.\u201dSeeing Lee Wooyeon shaking hands with the reporter, Inseop stood up.\u201cThen I will go first.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I will also be cheering for Wooyeon\u2019s drama.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cGoodbye.\u201dChoi Inseop also bowed his head to the reporter.\u00a0Reporter Ahn Ahreum smiled and waved her hand.\u201cBy the way, can I really call this number?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 If it\u2019s a business thing, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just joking.\u00a0See you next time.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0See you later.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t say anything until she left the restaurant and got into the elevator.\u00a0When there were only two people left in the elevator, Lee Wooyeon opened her mouth.\u201cShe must be your type.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIdeal type.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u00a0Not that\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t have a business card.\u00a0I got a business card\u2026 Sorry.\u00a0I did not give her my phone number with that intention.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry if you misunderstood.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who watched Choi Inseop flustered and apologing to him, smiled deeply.\u201cWhat is the misunderstanding?\u00a0If you like, you can give your contact information.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThe elevator door opened with a ding sound.\u00a0While going to the place where the car was parked, Choi Inseop was constantly making an upset face.\u00a0Even though he wasn\u2019t the type to make excuses for his actions, he seemed to want to make an explanation for this incident.Lee Wooyeon, who sat in the passenger seat, asked while putting on his seat belt.\u201cThen what kind of person is Inseop\u2019s ideal type?\u201dInseop, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, turned his head with a puzzled expression.\u00a0Like someone who didn\u2019t hear right.\u201cI\u2019m sure you have an ideal type.\u00a0Do you like a neat and feminine type like Yoon Ahreum from earlier?\u201dInseop quickly closed the car door and fastened his seat belt.\u00a0Muttering, \u201cLet\u2019s leave,\u201d he started the engine.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon persistently asked the question.\u201cYou don\u2019t have an ideal type?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIs there anyone who doesn\u2019t have an ideal type?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy was this person like this?\u00a0Why would someone do this to him?He wanted to yell at him to stop teasing him if he could.\u00a0But, what would come back was probably a notice of dismissal.\u201c There is. An\u00a0ideal type.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026A friendly person.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dAt Choi Inseop\u2019s resolute answer, Lee Wooyeon laughed lowly.\u201cDo they just have to be kind?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201dAnother word that he did not know how to interpret was said.\u00a0In-seop, who thought about it for a while, shook his head.\u201cA kind person is harder to find than you think.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dChoi Inseop seems to have misunderstood the meaning of the word easy. They just need to be kind.\u00a0The fact that such a person still existed was surprising to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cHave you ever been in love with a friendly person?\u201dInseop\u2019s eyes fluttered as he was reversing the car.\u00a0He knew that the other person was uncomfortable with the previous question, but Lee Wooyeon pretended not to know and asked again.\u201cWas your first love a kind person?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop bit his lip.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon wondered what he was desperately thinking in that little head.\u201cWho was it?\u201dInseop\u2019s expression gradually darkened.\u00a0If he pushed him a little more, he was even about to shed a tear.It was like his first love died.\u00a0How pitiful.Hiding his twisted heart, Lee Wooyeon whispered to Inseop in a friendly voice.\u201cWho was it?\u201dInseop\u2019s head throbbed at the persistent interrogation.\u00a0If he could stop Lee Wooyeon\u2019s slew of questions, he would answer everything.Whatever will be, will be.\u201c\u2026 they were a bad person.\u201dA word like a sigh came out of Choi Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u201cBad person?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cA bad person was your first love?\u00a0No, you had your first love.\u00a0Hahaha, sorry.\u00a0It\u2019s not that I\u2019m teasing you, because Inseop seems far from that kind of thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dChoi Inseop firmly shut his mouth at the thought of saying something useless.\u00a0Biting his lip, he rummaged through his pockets and held out a pale pink envelope to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt was given to me by a fan.\u201dRealizing that this was the biggest turnaround he could possibly have, Lee Wooyeon almost burst out laughing out loud.It was such a clever piece of work.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a gift, so I took it\u2026\u00a0Ahh!\u201dInseop, who was talking, screamed and opened his eyes wide.\u00a0A car driving out of the parking lot made a loud noise and came to a sudden stop.\u00a0A woman suddenly jumped out of the front and approached the window in the passenger seat with a slow smile.\u00a0The woman knocked on the window with her palm.\u00a0The moment he saw the woman\u2019s face, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cOppa.\u00a0I love you.\u201dAfter the dark confession of love, the woman smiled and walked away.\u00a0An accident could have occurred.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was very annoyed because of the woman who persisted like a cockroach even when ignored.If he had been holding the steering wheel, he might have pretended it to be a mistake and stepped on the accelerator.He shook his head, and ruffled his messy hair with his hand.\u201cAre you surprised?\u00a0Originally that girl\u2026 Why are your hands like that?\u201d\u201cWhats?\u00a0Ah\u2026\u00a0uh?\u201dAs Wooyeon pointed, Inseop realized that blood was flowing from his hand.\u00a0Confused, he rummaged through his pocket with the other hand and quickly wrapped the wounded hand with the handkerchief he pulled out.Without a word, Lee Wooyeon took the letter from Choi Inseop\u2019s hand and opened the blood-stained envelope.\u00a0As expected, it had several blades stacked inside it.\u201cThis\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe clenched his teeth and swallowed the rising swear words.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon opened the window and threw the envelope, then grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand.\u201cDoes it hurt a lot?\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d\u201cThere is a lot of blood.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to call Manager Cha, so wait a minute\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201dChoi Inseop desperately grabbed Lee Wooyeon.\u201cDon\u2019t.\u00a0Don\u2019t call Manager Cha.\u00a0Don\u2019t even tell your representative.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to cause any more trouble.\u201dIf he was to let them know that he was injured, they would have a pale face and open their eyes wide as if it was a big deal.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t know but Choi Inseop thought that he had caused a great inconvenience to the two of them.\u00a0That was why Choi Inseop was desperate.\u201cI can drive.\u00a0The bleeding will stop soon.\u00a0Really.\u00a0Look.\u00a0I\u2019m not that hurt\u2026\u201dBlood dripped from Inseop\u2019s hand as he unfolded the handkerchief that was wrapped around the wound.\u00a0The moment he saw the pinkish flesh, his stomach became nauseous.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dHe hurriedly covered his mouth, holding back his nausea.\u00a0Countless times, Lee Wooyeon tied Inseop\u2019s wound with a handkerchief.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like the wound is deep, but you still need to go to the hospital.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cAs requested, I won\u2019t tell the manager and the CEO that you were injured.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cInseop, please listen to my request instead.\u201dLee Wooyeon took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the blood from Inseop\u2019s hand.\u00a0The hair on Choi Inseop\u2019s head stood at his friendly behavior, which was obviously acting.\u201cWill you please?\u201dA friendly voice pierced Inseop\u2019s ear like a sword.Previous

He also added that when a leaf shrank away when touched with a hand means the person had a sensitive and delicate nerve.Inseop, who brought the flowerpot into the house with care, named the flower Kate that day.He always took it out on sunny days and brought it back into the house on cold days.\u00a0He also watered it meticulously and recorded\u00a0 it, and checked its condition.Before going to bed, he always touched Kate\u2019s leaves.\u00a0Seeing the leaves curling up, Inseop found comfort knowing that he was not alone.To Inseop, Kate was the only person in Korea with whom he had an open heart conversation..\u201cI\u2019m hurt.\u201dHe showed his hand to Kate and muttered to himself.\u201cSo I was dismissed early\u2026 I feel bad.\u201dShe wanted to touch Kate, but he was limited to touching her only once a day before bed.\u00a0The florist said that if he kept touching it, saying it was fun, the plant would get stressed and die.As he sat down on the floor, he began to mourn.\u201cI really don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything right.\u00a0Kate.\u201dOthers would point out that he was crazy, but he needed someone he could talk to openly.Choi Inseop, who worked quietly and faithfully by Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side, could not be himself.\u00a0Crying from loneliness, who liked to talk to people, Peter, a crybaby, was able to be himself only from the moment the rooftop door closed.\u201cI don\u2019t have time.\u00a0But I keep making mistakes.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, no, Phillip\u2026 I\u2019m going crazy.\u00a0Nothing\u2019s going right,\u00a0Jenny, I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing right now.\u201dInseop covered his face with both hands.\u00a0Tears flowed.\u00a0He was ashamed.\u00a0The guilt and shame that had been holding him down for a while came crashing down just by saying the name Jenny.\u00a0Even breathing was difficult.He sat on the floor and cried for a long time.\u00a0The tears did not dilute the guilt.\u00a0Still, he couldn\u2019t help but cry.After crying so much, he got thirsty, and Inseop got up.\u00a0He took a bottle of water from the refrigerator and drank water.\u00a0Tears welled up as he drank the water.He wiped the tears with his palms and changed his clothes.\u00a0When he checked my phone, there were two text messages.One was an unknown number.\u00a0When he checked the contents of the text, it was the reporter to whom he handed his phone number earlier.\u201cI\u2019m Yoon Ahreum.\u00a0I wish you all the best in the future.\u201dHe was about to send a reply, but he just gave up.\u00a0It was because he thought that there was no need to contact her unless it was for business purposes.\u00a0The other was from Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI\u2019m taking a break today.\u00a0Filming starts tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis was the first time Lee Wooyeon sent a text message.\u00a0Just reading the short sentences made his heart race.\u00a0Inseop buried his face in the pillow.\u00a0He opened his mouth and let out a silent scream.\u00a0Until he ran out of breath.\u201cIt\u2019s tiring\u00a0\u2026\u201dTaking his face off the pillow, he muttered quietly.When he decided to go to Korea, his whole family stopped him.\u00a0The reason for the opposition was that they could not send him to a foreign land when he had a weak body and where no one knew him.He was not blindly stubborn either.\u00a0Because he knew that no matter how much he talked about it, it was of no use.\u00a0He started working.\u00a0From waking up early in the morning, from washing the dishes to cleaning the restaurant, he did whatever he could to earn money.\u00a0In his spare time, he studied Korean.\u00a0The exercise didn\u2019t stop.\u00a0It took a year to collect all of the planned amount.\u00a0He knelt down in front of his father with his bank book containing all the money, and brought up the topic of going to Korea again.\u00a0His father looked at the calluses on his son\u2019s hand and nodded.Instead, he gave his son permission to go to Korea only after promising a one-year deadline, contacting him once every three days, sending an email if his phone did not work, receiving a regular checkup at the hospital once a month and sending a scan of the results. .If he were to write about the hardships he experienced after coming to Korea, ten notebooks were not enough.\u00a0In fact, there were exactly thirteen diaries written with tears at that time.That was how he was able to be where he was today.\u00a0Compared to when he was following Lee Wooyeon like a stalker and collecting data, it was a much better situation now.It was painful thoughHis body was comfortable, but his mental hardship was difficult to describe in words.\u00a0He was very intimidated and fearful, but he felt like he was going to die because he couldn\u2019t show it.When he injured his hand today, he almost fainted when he saw blood flowing.\u00a0He barely found a handkerchief and tied the wound, but when he had to look at his skin again, the sandwich he ate for breakfast almost came up.\u201cIt\u2019s tiring.\u00a0I think I\u2019m going to die. I\u2019m\u00a0lonely\u2026 I miss Mom, Will, Grandma, Mary, and Nicholas, I miss you.\u00a0I want to go home.\u00a0I\u2019m tired of Paris Baguette sandwiches.\u00a0I\u2019m scared of extreme fans\u2026 I\u2019m lonely.\u201dHe hugged the pillow and acted like a child to his heart\u2019s content.\u00a0He wanted to act as weak as he wanted, even when he was alone, because no one would see him.\u201cPhilip, \u2026I hate Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0I hate him.\u00a0I hate him.\u00a0I hate him so much\u2026 I won\u2019t like him. I don\u2019t like him.\u00a0I hate him.\u00a0He\u2019s a bad guy. A\u00a0bad guy. A\u00a0bad person.\u201dPlacing one cheek against the pillow, he mumbled monotonously.\u00a0Words piled up in his mind like a magic spell.\u00a0After repeating \u2018hate\u2019 and \u2018bad person\u2019 a hundred times, Inseop\u2019s cell phone rang.Choi Inseop jumped up from his seat and picked up his cell phone.\u00a0It was CEO Kim.\u201cCEO.\u00a0This is Choi Inseop.\u201dReturning to the mature manager, he knelt down and started talking on the phone.\u201cInseop, where are you?\u00a0Aren\u2019t you with Lee Wooyeon?\u201dIn-seop hesitated for a moment.Should he talk about hurting his hand because of the eccentric fan, or should he just keep quiet about it?\u201cI\u2019m at home.\u00a0I had urgent business, so I came home first.\u201dHe explained his situation in words that were neither false nor true.\u201cI thought so.\u00a0Manager Cha was suddenly called.\u201d\u201cManager Char?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon called him urgently and asked him to drive today, but I wondered what was going on.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon promised that he wouldn\u2019t say that he was hurt.\u00a0Strictly speaking, it wasn\u2019t a lie.\u201cSorry.\u00a0I will go back right away.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u00a0Are you okay?\u00a0Manager Cha will have a hard day today, huh?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I will leave right away.\u201dInseop picked up the clothes he had taken off.\u201c\u2026Lee Wooyeon said that if he called you, he will use manager Cha as a fixed manager in the future.\u00a0Forget it.\u00a0You better just rest at home today.\u00a0I just called because I was curious about what was going on.\u201dInseop felt guilty when he remembered the face of manager Cha, who was particularly pale on the day he came after working as Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to give affection, but he also didn\u2019t want to cause trouble.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Because of me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0Besides, today\u2026 Oh.\u00a0Ha ha ha ha ha.\u00a0Okay.\u00a0Can you stop by the office tonight?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0What time shall I come?\u201d\u201cCome around 9 o\u2019clock.\u00a0At that time, Manager Cha will also be free.\u201dInseop picked up a pen and wrote in his notebook, 9 o\u2019clock office.\u00a0There was no way he\u2019ll ever forget it, but it made him feel reassured to write everything down like that.\u201cYes.\u00a0I will come before then.\u201d\u201cNo no.\u00a0Just come on time.\u00a0Understand?\u201d\u201cYes. Then I\u2019ll be right on time.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Thank you for your effort.\u201dThe phone was disconnected.Inseop put his phone back on the desk and hugged the pillow.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go\u2026\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to go.\u201dHe wanted to look professional, so he said that he would go without asking why, but his heart was not okay.\u00a0On a day like today, he just wanted to rest at home.\u00a0His hand hurt and his heart was aching.He wanted to finish his day reading a novel.\u201cNo.\u00a0Calm down.\u201dHe got up and slapped his cheeks with both hands.\u00a0It was said that managing the mind with pain was a Buddhist practice.\u2018Sorry God.\u00a0I will live like a Buddhist only when I am in Korea.\u2019As the little tingling pain on his cheek was gone, he felt his heart weaken again.\u00a0Inseop slapped his cheek again with the palm of his hand.He looked at himself in the mirror, thinking that his body and mind would get used to the pain and not feel any pain at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just for today.\u201dManager Cha put his hand on Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0The smell of cigarettes was so strong that he thought he was going to cough, but Inseop struggled to endure it like an adult.Even after getting into the elevator, manager Cha did not release his hand on his shoulder.\u00a0While Inseop was thinking about when it would be a natural time to lower his hand, the elevator stopped at the office on the 9th floor.All the office lights were off.\u00a0Inseop was surprised and looked at the manager standing next to him.\u201cI think the CEO has left work.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0He said he was waiting here.\u201d\u201cObviously, I told you to come here by 9 o\u2019clock before\u2026\u201dThen all of a sudden, the office lights came on and sparks came from all over the place.\u201cSurprise!!\u201d\u201cSurprise!\u201d\u201cAhh!!!\u201dInseop screamed and hugged Manager Cha.\u00a0When people hiding in every corner of the office suddenly set off firecrackers, Inseop screamed louder than before and hugged the head the manager.\u201cMr. Inseop, over there, Mr. Inseop\u2026\u201dThe more he tried to remove the frightened Inseop, the more he tightened the arm he was holding.CEO Kim, who brought the cake with spraklers from the corner, started singing Happy Birthday without noticing it.\u201cHappy Birthday to you.\u00a0Happy Birthday to you.\u00a0Happy birthday dear Inseop.\u00a0Happy Birthday to you!\u201dEveryone clapped and rejoiced.\u00a0Inseop couldn\u2019t even raise his head properly because he couldn\u2019t assess the situation.\u00a0His heart was pounding and his vision was blurry.\u201cInseop.\u00a0What are you doing?\u00a0The cake is heavy.\u201dWhen CEO Kim called his name, manager Cha forcibly removed Inseop\u2019s arm.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0What are you so surprised about?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Ah\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you birthday, so you should have expected a birthday party.\u201dManager Cha\u2019s playful remarks made him realize that Choi Inseop, the person he borrowed the name from, celebrated his birthday today.\u00a0Also, the fact that the reason Cha volunteered to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager today without saying anything was because of Choi Inseop\u2019s birthday.\u201cMake a wish.\u201dCEO Kim held out the cake in front of Inseop.\u00a0The people in the office clapped and shouted Inseop\u2019s name to put out the candles.\u201cCongratulation.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d\u201cCongratulations on being discharged from the hospital.\u00a0Good luck in the future.\u00a0Quickly put out the candles.\u201d\u201cMake a wish!\u201dChoi Inseop looked like he was about to cry.\u00a0Because he didn\u2019t deserve to be treated like this.\u00a0Even so, the kindness of people was so nice that tears welled up.Inseop quickly blew out the candles because someone could see his red eyes. And before someone turned on the light in the office, he said, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d and opened his mouth.\u201cHuh? Why? Are you touched? You\u2019re so touched that you want to work here forever, right?\u201dCEO Kim replied with a smile.\u00a0Choi Inseop tried to pretend to be normal and said words that were contrary to his heart.\u201cI am embarrassed by this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t like this.\u00a0So, in the future, never\u2026 I hope you don\u2019t take care of me.\u201dHe deliberately spat out harsh words, knowing that he would never get a chance for the office people to celebrate his birthday again.Everyone was at a loss for words at the sudden gloomy atmosphere.\u00a0Inseop said goodbye and left the office.As he waited for the elevator, he felt the tears running down his cheeks.\u00a0Behind him, he heard manager Cha calling out to him.\u00a0Inseop did not wait for the elevator and ran in the direction of the emergency stairs.Thinking that if Manager Cha followed, he would be caught soon, he started going up the stairs in the opposite direction.\u00a0When he reached the roof after passing the tenth floor, he opened the door and burst into tears.\u201cUgh\u2014.\u201dEven now, he wanted to go down to the office and hold hands and say thank you to everyone.\u00a0\u2019Thank you for doing well.\u00a0If we do well in the future, I will be more grateful.\u00a0Let\u2019s be friendly\u00a0It would be fun to watch a movie together on days when there is nothing to do.\u00a0I would be very grateful if you could call me and talk to me when I am lonely.\u2019\u00a0To be that kind of friend.He wanted to vomit out the words inside and maintain a friendly relationship.\u00a0But to him now, all those things were just luxury.Because in the first place, he came here to betray Lee Wooyeon as well as the people who work with him.\u2018Don\u2019t be foolish.\u00a0I have to act like an adult.\u2019\u00a0However, it was very difficult to maintain that line.\u00a0Choi Inseop covered his face with both hands and cried profusely.\u201cUgh\u2013.\u00a0Ahh!\u201dAs he wiped away his tears, he fell backwards in confusion.\u00a0The man who was smoking a cigarette leaning against the roof railing was throwing an interesting gaze towards him.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe bit his lip in frustration that shook his whole body, but the tears didn\u2019t stop. Lee\u00a0Wooyeon threw his cigarette and started walking towards Inseop, who had fallen down.\u00a0Surprised by the momentum of Lee Wooyeon approaching, smiling with his hands in his pockets, Inseop fell to the floor and stepped back.\u201cUh\u2026Why\u2026\u00a0At home\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy am I here instead of home?\u201dInseop nodded his head instead of answering.\u00a0Tears still flowed down his collar.\u00a0He should have stopped crying, but he was so shocked that he couldn\u2019t.\u201cI stopped by because Manager Cha had something to do here for a while.\u00a0They said it would take 10 minutes.\u201dInseop knew that Lee Wooyeon hated driving.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know why exactly, but because of his inclination, Inseop was surprised and disappointed that he drove himself home today.\u201cThere are eyes that watch me below, so I often smoke here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dHe resented himself for overlooking the fact that the office was on the way to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house.\u00a0It was shameful to death that Inseop was found out by Lee Wooyeon, that he was not an adult at all.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201dLee Wooyeon squatted in front of Inseop and asked, putting his face close.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWhy are you crying like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say other than \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019.\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u00a0I\u2019m just curious as to why you\u2019re crying.\u201dIt was an expression of pure curiosity, with no worries or regrets for the other party.\u00a0The moment the always quiet and sincere manager ran up the roof crying like a child, another question came to his mind.Why was this bastard like this?Lee Wooyeon tilted his head slightly and asked again.\u201cWhy are you crying like that?\u201dIdiot, the words were hidden with a smile.Choi Inseop desperately shook his head to think of a valid reason.\u00a0What should he say?\u00a0What could he say to keep the image of a calm and mature manager?Inseop, who was moaning and thinking, remembered the surprise party that happened earlier.\u201cI was surprised\u2026 so I cried.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI cried because I was so moved that they held a birthday party for me.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t entirely wrong.\u00a0If he analyzed the reason for crying, it was 20% emotion, 70% remorse, 10% pessimism.\u201cIs it your birthday today?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t say that he didn\u2019t even think of the birthday written on the paper until CEO Kim held out the cake today and said happy birthday.\u00a0Inseop blurted out, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d.\u201cWere you so moved that people prepared a party?\u00a0Enough to come up here alone and cry?\u201dIf he saw an adult man crying loudly, wasn\u2019t it polite to pretend that he didn\u2019t see it and move on?Inseop thought that he could not understand Lee Wooyeon\u2019s intentions, who questioned him as if to confirm the fact that he was crying like a child.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u00a0I was touched.\u201dBut now he had no choice but to bow down and answer.\u201cAre you so moved by that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cYour ideal type is anyone as long as they\u2019re friendly, right?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0\u2026Yes.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know why it was being said here, but he answered it for now.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s soft laughter was heard from above.\u201cIt\u2019s easy, but also difficult.\u00a0I never knew.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0?\u201dThis was the person he didn\u2019t know.\u00a0Choi Inseop did not understand why Lee Wooyeon was smiling like that and why he said it was easy and difficult.\u201cThen, even if I treat you kindly, will you cry like that?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0 that is\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWill you cry more?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s not like that.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to bother anyone while he was working.\u00a0Even if it was Lee Wooyeon, the target of his revenge.He was going to work as best as he could and be fired.\u201cI\u2019m not crying.\u00a0Today, I was just a little surprised and suddenly burst into tears.\u00a0You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dA faint disappointment passed over Lee Wooyeon\u2019s expression upon hearing In-eop\u2019s answer.\u00a0Disappointment melted into his dark eyes as quickly as a snowflake that fell on a bonfire.\u201cI am very worried.\u201dJust as he was about to answer that he should not worry about that now, CEO Kim opened the roof door and came up to the roof.\u201cInseop!\u201d\u201cCEO\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop quickly turned his head and wiped his face with the palm of his hand, fearing that CEO Kim would know that he was crying.\u201cWhy are you making my manager cry?\u201dIt was in vain with Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words.\u201cDid you cry?\u00a0Did Inseop cry?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed and made a crying sound.\u00a0If Inseop could fly, he wanted to jump off the roof right now.\u201cHuh?\u00a0Why?\u00a0You\u2019re not mad?\u201d\u201cWhy are you angry?\u201d\u201cNo, he got angry and went out saying that it was burdensome to have a party. I thought you were angry because I called you for something like this.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were moved to tears?\u201dInseop\u2019s face flushed like a drunken man.\u00a0Under the current circumstances, he felt that it was useless to pretend to be cold and use a business-like tone. However, he could not reveal his feelings by crying.\u201cAre you really touched?\u00a0I thought you were angry for calling you again.\u201dWhen CEO Kim put on a relieved expression, Inseop felt even more sorry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, bowing his head, and CEO Kim smiled wildly.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0If that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s go back and have a birthday party.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe felt like dying.Refusing a birthday party like a cold city man and having to go back there with puffy eyes.\u201cI thought Inseop was good, but his heart is softer than he looks.\u00a0It\u2019s just a birthday party.\u00a0You were that thankful?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dIt was true that he was grateful, so he answered meekly.\u201cIf you\u2019re thankful, you can do well from now on. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I will do well.\u201dWhen Inseop responded obediently, CEO Kim chuckled and laughed as if he was satisfied.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon noticed that all of this was Kim\u2019s shallow trick to keep Choi Inseop by his side.\u00a0It was clear that only his asshole manager, who was bewildered and bowing his head, was unaware of the fact.He really didn\u2019t know.If he thought he understood the inside, he was hard to understand, and if he thought he was hard to understand, he acted surprisingly simple.\u201cLee Wooyeon.\u00a0Are you going down to the office too?\u201dCEO Kim hesitated and asked.\u00a0Of course he was not going\u00a0It was a question with hope.Lee Wooyeon smiled brightly.\u00a0It was a really sweet smile.\u00a0CEO Kim Hakseung remembered the past when he was deceived by that smile, and it was heartbreaking.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smile suddenly reminded him of the time he was drinking with Manager Cha, who cried out that he was a public fraud.Even if he pretended to be polite and friendly, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s frame was a filthy bastard.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t the kind of person who devoted his time to his manager.\u00a0And Kim didn\u2019t want that either.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to see Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes at the party. He wanted to have fun.\u201cWhy would you ask such a obvious question?\u201d\u201cHahaha. Is that so?\u201dYeah.\u00a0If he asked him, only his mouth would hurt.\u00a0He won\u2019t go to his manager\u2019s birthday party anyway\u2026\u201cOf course I should go.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my manager\u2019s birthday.\u00a0Asking the obvious.\u00a0Representative, you\u2019re too much.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s expression became complicated.\u00a0It was a face that could not believe what he said.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon put his arm around Inseop\u2019s shoulder and interrupted him.\u201cThen let\u2019s go down.\u00a0CEO.\u201dChoi Inseop was dragged down the stairs by Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms with a depressed face.\u00a0CEO Kim quietly took out his cell phone.\u00a0It was time to tell the bad news to manager Cha who had left Lee Wooyeon and come right away.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I\u2019m okay\u2026 Ugh.\u201dChoi Inseop, who had been walking before, stood up against the wall and groaned for a while before starting to walk again.\u00a0During the party, he couldn\u2019t refuse the drinks that people offered, and he took one drink at a time, and that was what happened.Choi Inseop refused to take a taxi or accept a ride.\u00a0All he said was that it was okay because his house was within walking distance of the office, slurring his words.Lee Wooyeon, who drove Inseop home for the first time today, knew that those words were not entirely wrong.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s house was located halfway between the office and his house, and it was within walking distance.\u201cAh\u2026 Uh\u2026\u00a0\u201dOf course in a sane state.Choi Inseop, who had been walking and leaning against the wall repeatedly, eventually collapsed to the floor.With his hands in her pockets, Lee Wooyeon cast his eyes on Inseop, who was having some difficulty.\u00a0No matter how late it was at night, Lee Wooyeon rarely walked home.\u00a0However, after a long time at a party held in the company, everyone was drunk.\u00a0Manager Cha started drinking the wine as soon as the party started, without anyone having time to try it.\u00a0It was an expression of his clear will that he did not want to become Lee Wooyeon\u2019s knight.The other employees also drank in a pleasant atmosphere when Inseop returned.Lee Wooyeon also drank a few glasses of wine served by CEO Kim, who had a depressed face.\u00a0In the end, there was no one to take the chance.\u00a0He never called for surrogate driving, so in the end, Lee Wooyeon followed Inseop along the road.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s dizzy.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m dizzy.\u00a0No, I\u2019m dizzy.\u201dInseop bowed his head and muttered incomprehensible words.\u201cWake up.\u00a0In this weather, it\u2019s still too much to sleep on the road.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dAfter answering, Inseop did not think about getting up.\u201cAre you going to stay here?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I will go first.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Bye\u2026\u201dUnable to finish saying goodbye, Inseop\u2019s body fell from leaning against the wall.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took out his cell phone and checked the weather for the night.Minus three degrees.It wasn\u2019t the weather where one would freeze to death by spending one night on the road.Lee Wooyeon left Choi Inseop lying behind and started walking.\u00a0Because of the chilly night air, people walking on the road accelerated their steps.\u00a0He wore a hat deeply and covered half his face with a scarf, but some of the passers-by turned their heads to look at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0But no one stopped and spoke to him.\u00a0Still, he stopped in the middle of the road.After thinking for a moment, he started going back down the way he had come up.Choi Inseop was lying on the floor in the same position he had fallen before.\u201cWake up.\u201dThere was no use in talking.\u00a0Perhaps he had fallen asleep after all, as he did not even give an insincere answer.\u00a0On the road, only the occasional sound of passing cars could be heard.Lee Wooyeon tapped Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder with his toe.\u00a0With a slight frown on his face, Inseop showed no sign of getting up.\u00a0Wooyeon pressed his foot on Inseop\u2019s shoulder and shook it slightly.\u00a0It was useless.If Choi Inseop was left as it is, it was clear that the schedule for tomorrow morning would be disrupted.\u00a0It was the day the drama filming started, so he had to prepare from dawn.If Choi Inseop did not appear, Wooyeon could fire him as an excuse.\u00a0It was a very good opportunity.\u00a0If it had been another manager, he would have done it without paying attention.\u00a0Because it has been a month already.Lee Wooyeon looked down at Choi Inseop\u2019s face, lying on the floor.It was a young face.\u00a0Even if he said he was still a student in school, he would believe it.He was skinny enough to wear a suit.\u00a0It was amazing how he could do so many things with that body.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201dThe world was a series of things one would never understand. Since he got to know that, Lee Wooyeon had been fooling around. He realized that it would be a waste of time thinking or wrapping his head around something he didn\u2019t understand.But this was a little different.Even while lying in the hospital room, Lee Wooyeon suddenly thought about why Choi Inseop did that and he could not stop thinking about it.\u00a0When he came to his senses, he went into the next room and looked down at Choi Inseop, who was sleeping.That didn\u2019t mean there was an answer though.Lee Wooyeon touched Choi Inseop, who was asleep at his feet, with his foot again.\u00a0As he kicked a little harder, Inseop raised his head, and frowned.\u201cWake up.\u201dIf he didn\u2019t listen this time, he thought he\u2019d just go, whether he froze or not.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was a human that would remain the same.If Inseop had not hugged Lee Wooyeon\u2019s pants with tears in his eyes, he would have done so.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon was someone who was different from ordinary people and their emotion, but in this situation, he couldn\u2019t help but be a little shocked.\u00a0While he was thinking for a moment whether he should put strength on his feet and let the thing sticking to his pants come off, Inseop blinked his big eyes and spoke.\u201cDon\u2019t go Jennie.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe thought he was a fool, but it seemed to be true that there was a woman he was dating.\u00a0Did he even meet foreigners?Inseop hugged Lee Wooyeon\u2019s feet even tighter and muttered the name Jenny a few more times.\u201cFuck, who are you calling Jennie?\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder and shook it relentlessly.\u201cHey.\u00a0Choi Inseop.\u00a0Do you have any friends to contact?\u201dChoi Inseop smiled, not even opening his eyes.\u201cDo you have any friends?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0do not have.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there one?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t have one.\u00a0I don\u2019t need\u2026\u00a0\u201dWhile trying to ask why he was talking informally, Lee Wooyeon bent down and took out a cell phone from Inseop\u2019s pocket.\u00a0He was thinking of finding the woman named Jennie and telling her to pick up this bastard.\u00a0That was all the goodwill he could bestow.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes widened as he looked at the call list on Inseop\u2019s cell phone.Office, Lee Wooyeon, Office, Office, CEO Kim, Office, Manager Cha, Manager Cha, Office, Office,\u00a0and Lee Wooyeon.The name Jennie was nowhere to be found.\u00a0He searched the list of phone numbers from start to finish just in case, but all the numbers stored were people related to work.\u00a0So was the text.\u00a0It was all about checking Lee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule and checking his clothes.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t a normal person\u2019s cell phone.If someone looked at Choi Inseop\u2019s cell phone, his whole life was directed towards Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0While standing in the street and checking Choi Inseop\u2019s cell phone, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips gradually moved upward.\u00a0He reached out and grabbed the unusual manager\u2019s shoulder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who drinks alcohol for fun?\u201d\u201cThen why are you drinking?\u201d\u201cI drink it because it\u2019s cool.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0My father and mother drank it like it was very delicious.\u201dPeter, who had never drank beer, wanted to try it every time he saw a can of beer thinking it was delicious.Peter took another sip of the beer.\u201cOh, it\u2019s not good.\u201dJenny laughed softly.\u00a0The wild birds sleeping were startled at the sound of her laughter and left their seats.\u00a0The sound of the tree rustling was heard.\u00a0Peter liked Jenny\u2019s laugh.\u00a0When she smiled, he felt better.\u00a0So much so that he made unrealistic wishes that she would always want to laugh.\u201cWould you like a toast?\u201dJenny asked, holding a can and waving her feet.\u00a0Her legs, visible under the worn-out skirt, were covered with scars.\u00a0It was pointless to ask where the injury was from or who did it.\u00a0Jenny\u2019s mother beat her daughter for nonsensical reasons.\u00a0She was a woman who beat her daughter for no reason, she would even make up a reason.\u00a0Jenny habitually said that on the day she became an adult, she would buy clothes from the most expensive department store and then say goodbye to her mother.\u00a0Peter waited for that day.\u00a0They even promised to go together to buy clothes that day and pick out clothes for themselves.\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cFor the love of me and the prince.\u201dWhen he heard the word prince, the broad shoulders he had seen that day came to mind.\u00a0It felt like blood was rushing to his face.\u201cAre you drunk already, Peter?\u00a0Your face is red.\u201d\u201cIs it\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s lame.\u00a0If it\u2019s like that, then you can\u2019t hang out with the other kids.\u201dJenny laughed loudly as Peter pouted his lips.\u00a0Her large body shook with laughter.\u00a0Peter wanted to make her laugh whenever he could.\u00a0Because once Jenny crawls into depression, there is nothing Peter can do to help.Jenny was severely bipolar.\u00a0He was clearly aware of that.\u00a0But knowing that didn\u2019t make it any better.\u00a0Peter almost didn\u2019t recognize Jenny the first time he met the depressed Jenny on the street, not the cheerful Jenny.\u00a0She didn\u2019t speak to him, nor did she make eye contact.Worried, Peter went to Jenny\u2019s house for the first time that night.\u00a0Contemplating whether to ring the doorbell or knock on the door, he heard Jenny\u2019s cry through the crack in the open door.\u00a0He swore he had never heard such a cry.\u00a0It was hard to believe it was a human voice.\u00a0Peter saw Jenny lying in the living room through the crack in the door and knew that the cry was Jenny\u2019s.Jenny, who was making a strange sound with all her emotions suppressed, abruptly got up and started eating ice cream.\u00a0She was eating it with so much greed that he couldn\u2019t tell whether she was eating it or crumpling it in her mouth.When Jenny, who said she didn\u2019t know why he was gaining weight even though she didn\u2019t eat much, overlapped with the figure in front of him, Peter got goosebumps.\u00a0Seeing the scene, Jenny\u2019s mother began to swear and beat her.\u00a0The two cursed at each other.\u00a0Peter\u2019s face hardened and paled at the sound of vulgar profanity that\u00a0 he had never heard of.In the end, he returned home without talking to Jenny.\u00a0When the depression hit, Jenny didn\u2019t even go to school.When she came out of the long tunnel of gloom, she came to Peter with a cheerful face as if she had always been like that.\u00a0In a gesture that was several times more exaggerated than usual, she talked about traveling for several days.The place she traveled to was at Aunt Spencer\u2019s house.\u00a0Jenny\u2019s eyes lit up as she described the story of a millionaire aunt who traveled the world.\u00a0The story of the party at Aunt Spencer\u2019s house, the jewelry, and the dress that her aunt gave her became more and more elaborate.\u00a0Peter knew that she was making up stories just like he did.The only difference between the two was that Peter knew that the story he had created was fiction and just enjoyed imagining it, and Jenny was addicted to the lie she had made up and considered it real.Jenny made up a story whenever she couldn\u2019t stand reality.\u00a0Peter knew all that, but didn\u2019t want to expose her wounds by pointing it out.\u201cDid we talk?\u00a0I mean, the last time I met the prince was in the school cafeteria.\u00a0I was passing by with a plate, and the prince looked at me and smiled.\u00a0It\u2019s clear.\u00a0He\u2019s also interested in me.\u00a0One day he will definitely talk to me again.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0I hope so.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have anyone you like?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0There are quite a few pretty girls in your class.\u201dPeter laughed silently.There were many pretty children.\u00a0Every woman in the world is pretty like a flower, Peter\u2019s father said.\u00a0Peter thought so too.\u201cYou are pretty too.\u201d\u201cOh.\u00a0What should I do? But I already have a man I like.\u00a0If things don\u2019t go well with the prince, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u201cWhat.\u00a0Am I a substitute?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0You are my friend.\u201dJenny, who was drinking beer, laughed bashfully.\u00a0He thought it wasn\u2019t enough, so even if he gave her his heart, it wouldn\u2019t be a waste, he added.\u201cYou are also my precious friend.\u00a0So I won\u2019t take you away from the prince.\u201d\u201cWhew.\u00a0Peter.\u00a0Sorry.\u00a0See you again in the next life.\u00a0At that time, I will definitely put you first.\u201dPeter put his hand on the rock and leaned back.\u00a0The cool breeze of the lake ruffled his hair.\u201cFeels\u2026great.\u201dPeter muttered.\u00a0\u201cMe too,\u201d said Jenny, and lay down next to him.\u201cIs this why you drink?\u201d\u201cHey hey.\u00a0What are you talking about when you can\u2019t even empty half a can of beer?\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0Is it?\u201dPeter took another sip of the beer.\u00a0He was impressed by the feeling of lukewarm carbonic acid, but the feeling of alcohol spreading into his blood made him feel better.\u201cPeter, shooting star.\u201dJenny, who was lying down, pulled Peter\u2019s clothes.\u201cDid you make a wish?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u00a0A prom party with the prince.\u201dEver since getting to know Philip, Jenny\u2019s wish has remained the same.\u00a0Being his prom partner, the prince of the school.\u201cI\u2019ll dance with you too.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be graduating then.\u201d\u201cYou can still dance.\u00a0Are you okay?\u00a0I will lead.\u201dThe way she spoke, which seemed to be sympathetic, was funny, and Peter burst out laughing.\u00a0The laughter didn\u2019t stop.\u00a0The laughter that had continued quickly turned into the sound of hiccups.\u201cDid you get drunk?\u201d\u201cUh-huh\u2026\u00a0hic.\u00a0Uh\u2026 Huuuu.\u201d\u201cOh.\u00a0Poor Peter.\u201dShe patted Peter on the back.\u00a0Peter also laid himself on the rock.\u00a0He felt much better.\u201cYou as well, quickly get someone you like.\u201d\u201cIs that going to happen the way I want it to?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, you should get the feeling, growing fond is only the second problem .\u00a0You just have to make up your mind.\u00a0Then it will be easier.\u201dPeter laughed and nodded at the advice of Jenny, an expert in unrequited love.\u201cNo one can stop what\u2019s going on in your heart.\u00a0The eyes follow that person first, and by the time you realize it, it\u2019s already too late.\u00a0You will realize that the heart has already gone before the eyes.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cWhen you wake up, the whole world is that person.\u00a0Ah!\u00a0Prince!\u00a0My whole world is the prince!\u201dJenny stretched out her arms towards the sky.\u00a0Peter reached out to follow her.\u00a0The cold wind tickled his fingertips.The world shook as the wind blew.\u00a0The first drink he experienced was absolutely delightful.\u00a0Until Peter, upset, vomits up everything he ate that evening.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019ll have a meal truck at the set. Let\u2019s eat there.\u201dThe moment he heard the word resting place, Lee Wooyeon skillfully turned around, seeing Inseop\u2019s shoulders shrug, recalling bad memories.\u201cLet\u2019s stop by the rest area for a while.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have time, so I\u2019ll just go.\u201dThere was nothing wrong with Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words.\u00a0Time was tight because they had to arrive at the set in Gangwon-do before 9 am.Since filming on set was a physical battle, they have to pay more attention to preparing breakfast than other days.\u00a0He should have drank in moderation, but the loneliness was so intense that he couldn\u2019t even say that he was smitten by the kindness of people, and he drank until past midnight.Was that all?\u00a0When he woke up, he was in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house.Choi Inseop was tired of his own stupidity and wanted to bang his head.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dAs Inseop let out a deep sigh without realizing it, Lee Wooyeon, who was reading the script, lifted his head.\u201cWhy?You have a headache?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cHow are your hands?\u201d\u201cFine.\u00a0The wound has almost healed.\u201dIt was just a razor cut, so there was more blood than the wound.\u00a0There was no problem in driving.\u00a0The only problem was that his hands were sweating and tingling from worrying about last night.\u201cI think you drank a lot yesterday.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0It was my birthdaybbeong, so I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cBirthdaybbeong?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJudging by his serious reply, it didn\u2019t look like he was joking.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and corrected his mistake.\u201cBirthday bbang.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bbeong, it\u2019s bbang.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u00a0bbang.\u00a0Birthday bbang.\u201dGripping the steering wheel, Inseop\u2019s ears quickly turned bright red.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon felt the urge to reach out and turn Inseop\u2019s head back.\u00a0Of course, he wasn\u2019t foolish enough to put it into action.\u201cI\u2026 I apologize if I made a mistake yesterday.\u201dChoi Inseop hesitated and opened his mouth.\u201cSomething wrong?\u00a0Ah, ha ha.\u00a0There was no mistake.\u201dNo mistake, Inseop\u2019s heart fluttered at the meaningful words.\u00a0To the extent that he wondered if there was something wrong with his now healthy heart.\u201cYou seemed to be pretty drunk.\u201d\u201cDr, Drunk?\u201dHe almost hit the brakes on the highway.\u00a0Inseop cleared his mind and asked in a calm tone as much as possible.\u201cI mean\u2026\u00a0Are you saying I was drunk?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShould he just open the car door and jump out of here?Seeing Inseop perplexed, Lee Wooyeon smiled and continued.\u201cIs Jenny the bad person?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cIs Inseop\u2019s first love Jenny?\u00a0The bad person?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dInseop groaned.\u201cJenny is not that kind of person.\u00a0If you don\u2019t even know Jenny, please don\u2019t say things like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe hadn\u2019t watched the manager for a long time, but it was a coincidence since he had never imagined him getting angry in this way.Strength entered the hand holding the script.\u201cSorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon first apologized.\u00a0Only then did Inseop realize that he had reacted unnecessarily, and replied with a soft voice, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It was my mistake to say that without knowing it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was after he had already shut his mouth when he felt that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice was subtly cold.There was an awkward silence in the car.\u00a0In the end, the two didn\u2019t talk at all until they arrived on set.As soon as he parked the car, Lee Wooyeon opened the car door and went out.\u00a0Inseop sighed.\u00a0In hindsight, it was usual for Lee Wooyeon to read a script or sleep in the car.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t long before Lee Wooyeon started talking to Inseop in the car.\u201cNever mind.\u00a0Basically, this is normal.\u201dHe mumbled bitterly.Inseop put the car key in his pocket, gathered various supplies, and followed Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Inside the filming set, the staff who arrived first were preparing for the filming.Seeing Lee Wooyeon greeting people with a bright smile, Inseop was relieved.\u00a0He was not angry.\u201cMr. Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Make up.\u201dThe makeup team called Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Inseop sprinted after him to receive the clothes.\u00a0The make-up of the main characters in historical dramas took several times longer than the make-up of modern dramas.\u00a0Inseop sat next to him and waited for him until he finished his makeup.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who had his eyes closed the whole time he put on makeup, called Inseop only after changing all his clothes.\u201cThis.\u201dHe handed over the clothes that he was wearing.\u00a0Inseop folded his clothes neatly in the suitcase he had prepared.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon started reading the script again.\u00a0The conversation ended there.The director called for Lee Wooyeon, and he left.\u00a0After contemplating for a while, Inseop left his outerwear and headed to the parking lot to put away the clothes in the car.\u00a0Putting his clothes in the van, he double-checked that the van\u2019s doors were locked.\u00a0This was because there were many fans who followed to the local filming location, opened the car door, and stole the things of their favorite stars.\u00a0When he was following behind him to dig up information about Lee Wooyeon, he witnessed a lot of things before his eyes as to how far a stalker fan could go.It was said that the day would be sunny, but the set in Gangwon-do was cold.\u00a0Inseop had a hot pack in his pocket, considering Lee Wooyeon\u2019s waiting time.\u00a0There wasn\u2019t even room for a hand in his pocket.Inseop moved his steps, melting his frozen fingertips.\u00a0As he walked down the street, blowing his hands, he couldn\u2019t even see who was walking in front of him.\u201cHey.\u201dNot even aware that the arrogant voice was calling him, Inseop walked forward.\u201cHey, hey.\u00a0You. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u201dAs the tone of his voice increased, Inseop raised his head in surprise.It was Kang Youngmo.After finishing the makeup, Kang Youngmo, who was walking with his manager, gestured to Inseop.He quickly bowed his head and greeted Kang Youngmo.\u201cCome here.\u201dChoi Inseop went and stood in front of him.\u00a0Kang Youngmo placed his hands on his waist and arrogantly raised his chin.\u201cWhen you see someone, you have to say hello.\u00a0What are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Just before\u2026\u201d\u201cSay hello!\u201dWondering if he didn\u2019t see it, Inseop bowed his head again and said, \u201cHello,\u201d louder than before.\u00a0Kang Youngmo smashed Inseop\u2019s head with the script he was holding.\u201cCan\u2019t you say hi?\u00a0Didn\u2019t you even learn to say hello?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dSurprised, Choi Inseop blinked his big eyes and tried to understand the situation.\u00a0He must have seen him say hello on this street.\u00a0In the end, the reason why Kang Youngmo was doing this wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t like the greeting, but that he didn\u2019t like him.\u00a0No, to be precise, it meant that he didn\u2019t like Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u201cSay hello properly.\u201dChoi Inseop bowed his head more deeply than before.\u00a0He said hello in the most polite voice possible, but Kang Youngmo\u2019s script slapped him in the head again.\u201cHey, you bastard.\u00a0Who taught you to greet like that?\u00a0Your mom and dad said it like that?\u00a0Is your boss like that?\u00a0Or is the actor you are in charge of teaching you that way?\u00a0You have bow enough to touch your knees.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTears seemed to flow from the sadness and sorrow.\u00a0Seeing Inseop struggling with being caught by Kang Youngmo, no one helped.\u00a0People who clearly knew Kang Youngmo\u2019s personality did not want to interfere and create problems.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dAlthough there was nothing to apologize for and nothing wrong with him, Inseop bowed his head and apologized for now.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to create any problem either.\u00a0If there was a problem with Kang Youngmo, Lee Wooyeon would also get involved.\u00a0He absolutely wanted to avoid it.However, what came back this time was a bundle of rolled up scripts.\u201cYou have to say hello properly from the beginning. Do you think you\u2019re something? Since you\u2019re Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, you can\u2019t see anything?\u201dKang Youngmo could not touch Lee Wooyeon, so he was arguing with the manager under him.\u00a0Even though he knew that Kang Youngmo\u2019s reason for tormenting him was unreasonable, Inseop didn\u2019t say a word.\u201cAre you sorry?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re sorry, go and buy a plate of sashimi.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want you to buy me a plate of sashimi.\u201dIt was forced.\u00a0To buy sashimi, he had to drive a car for a long time.\u00a0Inseop could not be absent for such a long time.\u00a0Whatever the purpose, for now, he had to keep his position as Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u00a0That was his job.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I can\u2019t leave right now.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re just saying you\u2019re sorry?\u201dKang Youngmo tapped Choi Inseop\u2019s forehead with the corner of the script.\u00a0Inseop, who was stunned by his insulting remarks, saw the figure of Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was walking from the other side while talking with the director, saw him. Their\u00a0eyes met.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u00a0Why are you looking the other way when I\u2019m talking?\u201dChoi Inseop quickly lowered his head.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Is it even possible that Lee Wooyeon is behind me?\u00a0Are you going to tell him?\u201dKang Youngmo smiled and pretended to look back.\u00a0Inseop shook his head.\u201cHeh. Go ahead and tell him like last time. Why? You can\u2019t do it?\u201dThe edge of the script that stabbed his forehead started to hurt more and more.\u00a0Choi Inseop bit his lip because he thought he was about to cry.He can\u2019t cry.\u00a0He can\u2019t cry and be unprofessional in a place like this, where everyone was watching\u2026 He still wanted to cry.\u201cSunbae.\u00a0You\u2019re here.\u201dA soft voice called Kang Youngmo softly.\u201cWhat?\u201dKang Youngmo turned his head with a no-nonsense expression.\u201cThe director is calling.\u201dKang Youngmo, who was struggling, reluctantly walked with the script on his side.\u00a0Inseop couldn\u2019t raise his head.\u00a0If he met Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes right now, he thought he would burst into tears that he couldn\u2019t turn back.\u201cMr. Lee Wooyeon!\u201dA voice was heard calling him from afar.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon turned and disappeared to the place where the director was.When Lee Wooyeon\u2019s back was too far to be seen, Inseop\u2019s eyes became blurred.\u00a0Tears from the corners of his eyes began to wet his shoes.He did not expect Lee Wooyeon to be angry with Kang Youngmo in front of people.\u00a0Because he wasn\u2019t a person with the generosity to throw his image for someone else.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even want that in the first place.\u2026Still, he should be able to ask pretentious questions about whether he was okay.\u00a0Pretending to be kind in front of people was a human trait.\u201c\u2026\u00a0What do you expect?\u201dInseop muttered, wiping away the tears with his palms.\u00a0He bowed his head at his own stupidity.\u00a0Are people incapable of learning?\u00a0Why was he doing this again?\u00a0He should calm down.\u00a0He shouldn\u2019t do this.\u00a0He shouldn\u2019t be weak.Choi Inseop slapped his cheek with his palm to cheer himself up.\u201cAck, it must hurt.\u201dInseop was startled by the voice coming from right behind him and turned his head.\u201cCome on, here.\u201dA woman dressed as a hostess took a handkerchief from her waist and held it to Choi Inseop.\u00a0As soon as he saw her chubby and warm face, tears began to form again in the corners of Inseop\u2019s eyes, as she reminded him of Jenny.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u00a0A grown man.\u201d\u201c\u2026sorry.\u201dTaking the handkerchief, Inseop quickly dried the corners of his eyes.\u00a0Even today, he didn\u2019t know how many times he apologized.\u00a0He was ashamed.It was the day where he realized he had still not grown from the skinny boy who had tears in his eyes from the teasing of Fred and the gang who had been tormenting him.\u00a0He was miserable\u201cThere are days when bullies are wild.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis floor is normally like that. If it\u2019s unfair, tremble. There\u2019s a saying like this.\u201dShe seemed to regard Choi Inseop as an unknown assistant performer.\u201cLet\u2019s go over there and sit down.\u00a0A little bit of air will make you feel better.\u201dShe pulled the hem of Inseop\u2019s sleeve, whose face turned red from crying.\u00a0Sitting on a bench at the back of the set, Inseop thanked her.\u201cSo.\u00a0It looks like you got caught by Kang Youngmo.\u00a0The rumors about him are bad.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I see.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one that person quarrels with.\u00a0He has fist fights with the staff and fights with the actors.\u00a0Ugh, really.\u00a0Is it enough if you are good at acting?\u00a0Human nature has been spoiled.\u00a0Actors have to go through personality tests too.\u00a0Then they would really be eliminated.\u201dInseop smiled softly at her cheerful voice.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you smiling.\u00a0My name is Lee Eunyoung.\u00a0Yours?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201cIs this your first time filming?\u00a0Haven\u2019t you received the role yet?\u201dChoi Inseop hesitated for a moment, then opened his mouth.\u201cI am not an actor.\u201d\u201cStaff?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 Manager.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Really?\u00a0Nonsense.\u00a0You look so young.\u201dThe saying that he looked young had always been heard in the United States.\u00a0He thought it was because Westerners had a hard time figuring out the age of Asians, but when he heard such things even in Korea, he felt strange.\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cTwenty-six.\u201d\u201cWow.\u00a0OMG.\u00a0At most, I thought you just graduated from high school.\u201dHe was actually twenty-four.\u00a0In Korean age, he was twenty-five, and he would have been in the military.\u00a0Choi Inseop said with a bitter face, and answered Lee Eunyoung\u2019s words.\u201cWhose manager?\u00a0Choi Eunbyeol?\u00a0Yoon Yiseok?\u00a0Go Yoonji?\u201dWhenever the names of other actors in this work appeared, Choi Inseop shook his head.\u201cNo way\u2026\u00a0Kang Youngmo?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen who?\u00a0Who is left?\u201dShe tilted her head and said, \u201cNo way,\u201d and opened her eyes.\u201c\u2026I am Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u201dWhen the words of confirmation came out of Choi Inseop\u2019s mouth, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense,\u201d and trembled even more than before.\u201cReally?\u00a0Really?\u00a0Are you really Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWow.\u00a0I envy you.\u00a0Then you can see each other\u2019s faces closely every day, talk, and eat together.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0We eat food sometimes\u2026\u201d\u201cI envy you!\u00a0Envy!\u00a0Wow, how is he?\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, is he really that polite and kind?\u201dAfter hesitating for a while, Inseop answered yes.\u201cI saw him from a distance, and he was really handsome.\u00a0He looks more handsome up close, right?\u201dInseop laughed awkwardly.\u00a0He had no intention to refute her statement that Lee Wooyeon was handsome.\u201cAre you two very close?\u00a0Then can you let me take just one picture with him later?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I think that would be a bit difficult.\u201d\u201cAh, Lee Wooyeon must hate that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m not close with Lee Wooyeon.\u201dSaying that, Inseop lowered his head.They were not friends now, but he didn\u2019t intend to be friends in the future.\u00a0The only purpose was to quickly catch Lee Wooyeon\u2019s weakness and go to America.\u00a0He had to think about that, but he kept thinking about other things and his head got complicated.\u201cHave you just started working?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen you can get to know each other little by little.\u00a0What are you so depressed about?\u201dInterpreting Inseop\u2019s lonely expression in a different way, she smiled brightly and patted his shoulder.\u00a0At her generous laughter, Inseop mumbled inside without realizing it.\u201cI\u2019m not going to make friends.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cFriends\u2026 we won\u2019t be friends. Probably.\u201d\u201cCome on. That\u2019s impossible. As time goes by, we\u2019ll all get close. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s like that at first in work life. Look at me. I want to be a representative actress in Korea, but my role is always a side character. Still, I live thinking that I can play a better role in the future.\u201dShe was a very cheerful person.\u00a0He felt the contagious joy when he was next to her.\u00a0Inseop said thank you in a small voice.\u201cCheer up. There are weird bosses like that in the company. When I was working for an insurance company in the past, there was a manager who had a dirty temper like Kang Youngmo, and he was so annoying. When I went to an acting academy, he said to lose weight and look in the mirror.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0You are pretty.\u201d\u201cMr. Inseop knows how to flatter.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u00a0That\u2019s how you have a social life.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not flattery.\u00a0All women are pretty.\u201d\u201cOh my. Oh my. It doesn\u2019t look like that, but you have a Casanova personality.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I didn\u2019t mean it like that, really\u2026\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0I know. Inseop is so cute. You can\u2019t tell the difference between the teasing words.\u2026\u201dThat was all Lee Eunyoung said.\u00a0She opened her mouth with a surprised expression as if she had seen a ghost.\u00a0Choi Inseop turned his head to check what was at the end of her gaze.\u201cYou were here?\u00a0I\u2019ve been looking for you for a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201dSurprised, Inseop stood up from his seat.\u00a0With the script in hand, with arms crossed, Lee Wooyeon was standing there smiling brightly.\u201cDoes Inseop have the car keys?\u201d\u201cYes?\u00a0Oh yes.\u00a0I have it.\u201dAs Inseop rushed through his pockets, Lee Wooyeon raised his hand as if giving up.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk as we go.\u201dLee Wooyeon greeted the woman who was still looking at him with a surprised face and held Inseop\u2019s arm.Choi Inseop was startled and shook off his arm.\u00a0No one saw the chill seeping into Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smiling eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Your hands would still hurt.\u00a0I didn\u2019t pay attention.\u201dLee Wooyeon first made up the reason for Choi Inseop throwing away his arm.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u201dInseop, who couldn\u2019t tell a lie, turned his gaze to the side.\u00a0Watching the manager rubbing his arm with the opposite hand without making eye contact, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s stomach twisted.He didn\u2019t even know why just because a bastard took good care of him like an idiot.The side profile of Lee Wooyeon, who was walking with such a thoughtful expression on his face, the additional cast members and staff members glanced and blushed.\u201cI left something in the car, so please go with me.\u201d\u201cI will go.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Okay.\u00a0I have to find it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u00a0This.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s outerwear that Choi Inseop was holding was draped over his shoulder.The two began to walk side by side.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hummed and greeted everyone he met while walking.\u00a0Choi Inseop also greeted them, but there was no conversation between the two of them.He was more awkward than before.\u00a0He hated it\u2026 He wanted to go home.\u201cAbout before.\u201dLee Wooyeon spoke first.\u00a0Inseop responded with an awkward voice to his gaze looking at him with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0I think of it as a social life and I will endure it.\u00a0You don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u00a0I don\u2019t care.\u201dHaving said this, Inseop bit the tip of his tongue in his mouth.No.\u00a0There was no need to add the last word.\u00a0What was the difference between saying that out loud and asking him to take care of him?\u201cWhat do you mean?\u00a0I was asking about that friend earlier.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Friend?\u201d\u201cThe woman next to Inseop.\u00a0Is she a new friend?\u201d\u201cAh, Eunyoung\u2026\u00a0no, not friends, just\u2026\u201d\u201cJust?\u201d\u201cI was just talking\u2026\u00a0I think she is a good person.\u201dEven as he answered, Inseop could not erase the strange feeling that he was being questioned for some reason.\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t need it.\u201dWhen he heard Lee Wooyeon muttering in a low voice, he asked back, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u00a0So, have you become very close with her?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know because I met her for the first time today.\u201d\u201cCan we be friends?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t close with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHe didn\u2019t think Lee Wooyeon would have heard it from there.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s face turned white and blue repeatedly.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Why aren\u2019t you friends with me?\u00a0You\u2019re my manager.\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026I\u2019m not good at my job yet, so\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are doing a good job, Mr. Inseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon slowly closed his eyes and opened them.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s eyes were clearly engraved with a slight frown around his eyes as if he was dazzled by the sunlight.\u201cYou are the best manager ever.\u00a0You make no mistakes.\u201dNot knowing whether to be happy or sad, Inseop quietly nodded his head at the compliment.\u201cAnd what does being unable to work have to do with being friends?\u00a0Right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cBesides, Inseop is my lifesaver.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cSo, let\u2019s be friends from now on.\u201dAt that word, Inseop\u2019s expression was complicatedly wrinkled.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was smiling, but it wasn\u2019t very pleasant.The manager\u2019s foolish attitude of not answering that he would do so even when he said something meaningless at a level of eating together someday twisted his judgment.\u201cDo you hate me?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.Like a person stabbed in the spine with the tip of a sharp knife, Choi Inseop was startled and answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0I know.\u00a0There\u2019s no way Inseop doesn\u2019t like me.\u00a0He was the one who risked his life to save me.\u201dInseop became increasingly uncomfortable with this conversation.\u00a0Rather, he regretted that he didn\u2019t hand the car key to Lee Wooyeon earlier and say that he would wait.\u201cBy the way, what did you mean by \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0It\u2019s nothing.\u201dInseop thought that Lee Wooyeon would talk about his affairs with Kang Youngmo.\u00a0When Kang Youngmo smashed his head with the script, his eyes met with Lee Wooyeon from afar.Obviously their eyes met\u2026\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0Nothing happened.\u201dThere was no need for him to go out and make a big deal.\u00a0No, even if he said it, he didn\u2019t think Lee Wooyeon would make a big deal out of it.When they arrived at the place where he parked the car, Lee Wooyeon held out his palm.\u00a0Choi Inseop took the key out of his pocket without saying a word.Lee Wooyeon, wanting to find something important, pulled out a ballpoint pen from the back seat.\u201cI found it.\u201d\u201cDo you have anything else?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I had to memorize it while striking the line with this ballpoint pen to get the lines right.\u201dAlthough it was questionable what Lee Wooyeon was saying, who usually memorized quite a few lines by scanning the script with his eyes, Inseop did not say anything.\u00a0He locked the car door and pulled the handle twice to make sure the door was locked.\u201cWhy are you pulling it twice?\u201d\u201cDouble check. Just in case.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s gaze, looking down at Inseop, deepened for a moment.\u201cYou have good pronunciation.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cEnglish pronunciation.\u00a0I think it\u2019s better than Korean pronunciation.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0No.\u00a0Korean pronunciation is much better.\u201dChoi Inseop waved his palms as if they were fluttering, and made a serious facer.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon laughed.\u201cI praised you for speaking good English, but you hate it?\u201d\u201c\u2026thank you.\u201dA cold sweat ran down his back.\u00a0Again he made a mistake.Communication was not a problem at all, but there were many loopholes in understanding jokes or understanding hidden meanings in words.\u00a0Choi Inseop vowed to answer only in a short-answer form with Lee Wooyeon if possible, without saying anything other than necessary.\u201cIf it\u2019s cold while waiting, you can wait in the car.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIt will be difficult.\u00a0In the case of historical dramas, the standby is long.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFrom afar, the assistant director spotted Lee Wooyeon and beckoned him.\u00a0He took off the robe he was wearing and handed it to Inseop.\u201cIt will be a long day.\u201dBefore the sound of the words faded away, Lee Wooyeon stepped forward.\u00a0Choi Inseop stood silently and watched his back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cCut.\u201dWhen the director\u2019s cut rang, Lee Wooyeon and Kang Youngmo, who had just sat facing each other and displayed a friendship like no other in the world, turned their faces.\u201cAfter taking a five-minute break, we start with the scene reading Mr. Youngmo\u2019s letter.\u201dKang Youngmo motioned he understood and stood up.\u00a0His manager ran over and brought blankets and clothes to cover him.\u00a0Kang Youngmo shouted, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring hot water?\u201dChoi Inseop, who was standing near the pillar, also ran to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cThank you.\u201dIf they only had to shoot the next two scenes, today\u2019s shoot was over.\u00a0Of course, no one could predict how long it would take to film those two scenes.The robe that Inseop was holding was draped over Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cGo to the car and sleep.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cI think it will take a couple more hours.\u201dIt was already past midnight, and Inseop wanted to cry when he said that it would take a couple more hours.\u00a0Of course, he didn\u2019t show it on the outside, and he calmly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d, but he just wanted to go home and lie down.It would be nice to take a hot shower and sleep with Kate once\u2026 Today was the day he called his mom.\u00a0Fortunately, it will be midday in the United States by the time he goes home and makes a phone call.\u201cYou don\u2019t look good at all.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and put his hands in his pockets.\u00a0He looked at Inseop when he touched the warm object.\u201cIs it a hot pack?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSo the clothes were warm.\u201dEven during breaks, Lee Wooyeon, who read the script while putting his clothes on his shoulders, did not know what was in his pocket.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cI think the only person who thinks of me like this is Inseop.\u201dThat was correct.From the time he opened his eyes to the time he closed his eyes, Inseop only thought of Lee Wooyeon all day.\u00a0He remembered his schedule and planned the day to spend with him.\u00a0He was only looking for an opportunity to catch Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fatal weakness.So, he only thought of Lee Wooyeon.\u201cBut why are you empty-handed?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked, pointing to Inseop\u2019s frozen red fingertips.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t have enough hot packs\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop was more sensitive to temperature than others.\u00a0It was easy for him to get cold and hot.\u00a0Because of the longer filming time than expected, the hot packs Inseop brought to use were also used to warm Lee Wooyeon\u2019s clothes.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t even put his hands in his pockets because he was holding Lee Wooyeon\u2019s clothes.\u00a0However, he didn\u2019t want to put his hands inside Lee Wooyeon\u2019s clothes.\u00a0In the end, his hand was frozen.Choi Inseop put his hand in his pocket.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took out a hot pack from his pocket.\u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201dHe threw the hardened hot pack into the trash and pulled Inseop\u2019s hand out of his pocket.\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cWarm up your hands.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand and put it in the pocket of his coat.\u00a0Choi Inseop tried to remove his hand, but the more he did, the more Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand.\u00a0Inseop was on the verge of screaming because his hand hurt.The warmth transmitted from hand to hand was warm, but due to the immense grip strength, it was hard to tell whether it was a good thing or a bad thing.\u201cStay still.\u00a0Your hands are frozen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201dKnowing that Inseop was embarrassed and flustered, Lee Wooyeon pretended not to know and turned his gaze to another place.\u00a0The female staff members passing by joked about Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI would like to be the manager of Mr. Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cI want to be Wooyeon\u2019s manager too.\u201dIt was rare for the staff to talk to the lead actor without hesitation and joke around.\u00a0As such, the image of actor Lee Wooyeon was kindness itself.\u00a0But for Inseop, his friendly image became poison.\u201cNow my hands are warm.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it still cold?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u00a0Now stop\u2026\u201dKang Youngmo, who was passing by drinking coffee, frowned at the sight.\u201cWhat.\u00a0Was it like that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u00a0Sunbae.\u201d\u201cAre you two like that?\u00a0Hahaha, is that why your manager was so cocky with me?\u201dEven today, Kang Youngmo had Choi Inseop run an errand three times to bring him warm water.\u00a0Thinking that he didn\u2019t understand the sign of putting his manager next to him and harassing someone else\u2019s manager, Inseop diligently picked up water and gave it to Kang Youngmo.Of course, each time, Kang Youngmo said that the water was too hot or cold, and poured the water that Inseop brought onto the floor.Inseop wanted to ask him if there was something in his actions where he could associate the word arrogance.Lee Wooyeon did not respond to Kang Youngmo\u2019s words.\u00a0That made Kang Youngmo even more angry.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that Lee Wooyeon liked men.\u00a0I know that women would go crazy if they knew.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed out loud.\u00a0Choi Inseop was nervous.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know if Lee Wooyeon would reveal his true nature and change his behavior\u00a0 to beat Kang Youngmo.\u00a0In that case, he would be able to grant Jenny\u2019s wish without having to dig out the secret himself\u2026Lee Wooyeon, who was smiling while shaking his shoulder, hardened his expression and approached Kang Youngmo.\u00a0When the man, with his extraordinary physique, suddenly approached in front of him, Kang Youngmo was startled and stepped backwards.Lee Wooyeon stood in front of Kang Youngmo with a cool expression on his face.The staff were also startled, so they stopped moving and looked at them.\u00a0Everyone was puzzled by the sudden change of Lee Wooyeon, who always had a gentle smile like a bodhisattva.\u201cCan I hold your hand too?\u201dHowever, the words that came out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth were completely absurd.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI will hold your hand.\u00a0If it\u2019s cold.\u201dLee Wooyeon took Kang Youngmo\u2019s hand.\u00a0Kang Youngmo, bewildered, shouted and pulled out his hand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled as he watched him walking away vigorously.Choi Inseop took the opportunity to pull his hand out of his pocket.\u201cTo the bathroom\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop barely mumbled a word and ran away from the place.\u00a0The hand held by Lee Wooyeon was hot.\u00a0It felt like someone had put some paste on his hands.\u00a0He wanted to wash his hands.\u00a0He wanted to wash away that sensation quickly with water.Choi Inseop went to the bathroom, turned on cold water and washed his hands.\u00a0The wound that had not yet healed stung.\u00a0It didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0If only he could wash away the warmth left on his hands.His fingertips, which had barely warmed, froze cold.\u00a0He lost feeling in his hands.\u00a0Only the sound of running water from the sink rang out in the empty bathroom.He looked in the mirror.\u00a0Choi Inseop brought his fingertips to his face as usual.\u00a0Blood rushed to the tip of his frozen fingertips.The coldness of the heart that seemed to freeze and the tickling warmth of each of his cell dancing were mixed together, making it impossible to know what was what.\u201cLike a fool\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t stand it because he hated himself for being shaken by such nonsense.\u00a0He thought that his heart was already dead\u2026 With Jenny, he believed it had been buried with her.He raised his head.\u00a0His wet eyes were stained red.Peter, not Choi Inseop, was standing there.\u201cPeter. You\u2019re\u00a0late.\u00a0Come down quickly.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Wait.\u201dPeter, who was ready, slowly descended the stairs.\u00a0His father beckoned him to come down quickly.\u201cWe will be late.\u00a0We\u2019ll have to go now, so that we can reach on time, right?\u201d\u201cCan I not go?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dNormally, he accepted all of his son\u2019s foolishness, but this time, Inseop realized that his father was too stubborn and got into the car reluctantly.Today was the day of the monthly Korean student council meeting.\u00a0Since Inseop was adopted to the United States when he was one year old, he did not have any particular patriotism in Korea.\u00a0However, Peter\u2019s father, a third-generation Korean American, said it was important to know his roots and even gave him a Korean name.His father insisted that if he goes to the Korean student council and hang out with the same Korean students, he will be able to understand more about the country he was born in.\u00a0Peter didn\u2019t really agree with that.Even in the student council, Peter had no particular sense of belonging.\u00a0He was reluctantly attending because of his father\u2019s insistence.\u00a0It was all about sitting in the back seat, reading a book, or just enjoying daydreaming alone.\u00a0Even there, no one paid any attention to him.\u00a0After thinking that his time was wasted, Peter stopped attending the meeting.\u00a0After hearing from the Korean community that he hadn\u2019t been to the meeting for four months, his father decided to take the time today and drop off his son himself.\u201cCall me, I\u2019ll come pick you up when you\u2019re done.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just figure it out.\u201d\u201cAre you going to go somewhere else?\u201dHe shook his head sternly, knowing that his son had gone elsewhere and read a book in the library or on a park bench.\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019ll be waiting here at the end of the day, so be sure to call me.\u00a0Understand?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPeter answered helplessly and entered the building.\u00a0The children who were seated first were chatting with each other.\u00a0No one recognized him and greeted him.\u00a0Peter sat down in a corner and took out the book he had brought and began to read.Today was the day of class and discussion on Korean literature.\u00a0It was uncomfortable to hang out with people, but the literature class itself wasn\u2019t bad.For his son who liked books, his father also ordered Korean novels and presented them to his son.\u00a0The novel he was reading now was a gift his father gave him.\u00a0But that was all.\u00a0Peter liked the book, but couldn\u2019t find more than that.He turned the pages and prayed that time would pass quickly and the class would be over.That was then.The surroundings became quiet as if someone had poured cold water on them.\u00a0As Peter lifted his head, a friendly voice came from overhead.\u201cIs the seat next to you taken?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0uh, \u2026\u00a0no.\u201dThe boy sat down next to Peter.\u00a0The girls in the auditorium murmured and looked at the boy.\u00a0Peter knew what the meaning of that gaze was.Admiration, and surprise.It was today that Peter found out for the first time that Jenny\u2019s prince was of Korean descent.\u00a0And most of the people gathered here were like that.The prince sat down calmly and waited for the start of class, not paying attention to his gaze.\u00a0Until the teacher came in and told everyone to take their seats, all eyes in the auditorium were on the boy sitting next to Peter.The class was conducted in Korean.\u00a0Peter was concerned about Jenny\u2019s prince sitting next to him, so he couldn\u2019t even hear the teacher\u2019s voice.As if he felt a glance at him, the boy gave a gentle glance to Peter.\u00a0Peter quickly turned his head.\u00a0He felt guilty for making eye contact with her prince without Jenny\u2019s permission.\u201cWho will read the poem we will learn today?\u201dThe teacher\u2019s eyes scanned the auditorium.\u00a0Everyone could immediately notice where her gaze stopped.\u201cOkay.\u00a0You said you were here for the first time today.\u00a0Your name\u2026\u201d\u201cPhillips Levin.\u201dHis name leaked out of someone\u2019s mouth before the boy could answer.Phillip Levin.As a quarterback for WT Utson\u2019s football team, he was so famous that everyone in the neighborhood knew his name.\u201cPhilip.\u00a0Okay.\u00a0Would you like to come forward?\u201dEven though he wasn\u2019t criticized, Peter couldn\u2019t lift his head properly because his heart was pounding.Phillip slowly got up from his seat and went out to the front of the auditorium.Peter looked up slowly.\u201cDo you have a Korean name?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWith a soft smile, the boy continued.<I am Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Please take care of me.>At that moment, for the first time, Peter realized that Korean was a word with such a respectful sound.\u00a0And he couldn\u2019t help but be surprised at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s near-perfect Korean pronunciation.<Can you read this poem to me?>The teacher handed him the book.\u00a0The boy stood with his elegant hands wrapped around the back of the book and began to read the poem down.<Kim Namjo.\u00a0For you.>A deep silence filled the auditorium.<My night prayers are long and repeat one thing.Opening your eyes quietly is an unbelievable blessing.>It was a beautiful poem.\u00a0The words that came out of the boy\u2019s mouth created poetry.\u00a0Peter looked at the boy who read the soulful poetry.<My dear, a bright soul who is thoroughly filled with only the freshly bloomed light.A generous love that I could not attain even when I let down my hair and lie lonesomely.>The sunlight pouring down from the high window of the auditorium hit the boy\u2019s hair.\u00a0Each time his soft voice broke into the light and touched the air, Peter took a deep breath.The boy\u2019s voice echoed softly in the auditorium.The words of the boy which dispersed in the air and met again to create a delicate image whispered in his ear.<For I will live for you, I shall give you anything precious.I shall forget things I already gave you and remember only the love I haven\u2019t given you.\u00a0My dear.In the distant sky where snow is falling, I behold you like I behold a halo of the moon..>No one could take their eyes off the profile of the boy reading the poem with his eyes down.\u00a0He caught everyone\u2019s attention in the auditorium.\u00a0Peter couldn\u2019t take his eyes off him.<Only for you, everything has a name and joy.My dear.>The boy raised his head.The girls who were listening to the poem read all at once threw their gazes at him.He handed the book back to the teacher.\u00a0The teacher praised the boy\u2019s perfect pronunciation and started explaining the meaning of the poem to the students.The boy returned to his seat and sat down.The schoolgirls sitting near him turned and glared at the boy.\u00a0The boy leaned his chin as if concentrating on the class and listened to the teacher\u2019s explanation.He should have jotted down all of this in his notebook, but Peter couldn\u2019t.\u00a0All he did was read the same pages of the book over and over again.\u00a0But not a single word entered him mind.When he woke up, Peter noticed that he was writing the same words over and over in his notebook.My dear.\u00a0My dear\u2026\u00a0My dear.It was the last verse of the poem the boy had read.As soon as class was over, Peter tore up the paper from his notebook and threw it in the trash.\u00a0It was Sunday afternoon when he first kept a secret from Jenny.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Love History Caused by Willful NegligenceCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop took a deep breath.\u00a0He turned on the water in the sink again and started washing his hands.He turned off the faucet when the sensation in his fingertips was gone.\u00a0All that was felt on his fingertips was the freezing cold.He touched his heart as he looked at himself in the mirror.\u201cYou can do it.\u00a0Let\u2019s think of one thing.\u201dHe slapped his cheek with the palm of his hand and left the bathroom.\u2018Let\u2019s not be weak. I\u00a0can do.\u00a0I can do it.\u00a0Let go of useless nonsense.\u2019Inseop constantly muttered and walked quickly.\u00a0It was perhaps a natural response that he started walking faster without seeing the person walking from the opposite direction as he turned the corner.\u201cOh!\u201dA woman\u2019s voice followed after bumping into each other.\u00a0When Inseop raised his head in surprise, the person he had already bumped into was on her buttocks on the floor and leaning back.\u201cSorry.\u201dChoi Inseop quickly reached out his hand and lifted the person that fell.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0This happened because I walked carelessly.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe apologized over and over and looked around to see if the other person was hurt.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0I just fell a little\u2026\u00a0 oh.\u201dThe woman let out a short exclamation and pointed a finger at Inseop\u2019s face.\u201cYou\u2019re the close friend of Lee Wooyeon whom I met by chance after a long time, but now you\u2019re working as Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager!\u201dThere were thorns in her words.\u00a0Choi Inseop recognized reporter Kim Haeshin and bowed his head.\u201cI envy Lee Wooyeon. A close friend serves him as a manager.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop made no excuses.\u00a0It felt like she knew everything.\u201cI heard that from that day on, Lee Wooyeon said that he will not accept any interview from us.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u00a0We do not decline or refuse interviews with specific media outlets.\u00a0If the time is right, we will make an appointment.\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u00a0But coincidentally, the time seems to be off with us.\u00a0Mr. Lee Wooyeon.\u201dAfter the interview that day, Lee Wooyeon had given an order not to accept interviews with reporter Kim Haeshin.\u00a0The day she will officially interview Lee Wooyeon will not come in the future.\u00a0Reporter Kim Haeshin and Choi Inseop knew that fact.\u201cWhen the time is right, we will make an appointment.\u201dTherefore, Inseop had no choice but to repeat the same words as before.\u00a0Reporter Kim Haeshin glanced at Inseop, then pulled out a cigarette from her pocket and put it in her mouth.\u00a0She was digging through her pockets and bags looking for a lighter. She asked whether he had a lighter.\u00a0Inseop took a lighter from his pocket and lit her cigarette.While exhaling smoke, reporter Kim Haeshin suggested Choi Inseop to smoke.\u201cI don\u2019t smoke.\u201d\u201cWhy does a person who doesn\u2019t even smoke carry a lighter?\u00a0Who are you going to light a fire for?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFrom the day after learning that Lee Wooyeon smoked occasionally, Inseop always carried a lighter in his pocket.\u201cI carry it with me because I never know when I will need it.\u201dInseop put the lighter back into his pocket and answered as soon as possible.\u201cBut what are you doing here at this hour?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking too early.\u00a0Why would a person like me come to this place at a time like this?\u00a0It\u2019s obvious.\u00a0I\u2019m just wandering around looking for news.\u201dReporter Kim Haeshin smiled as she held up the large camera hanging from her neck.These days, the more provocative the news articles, the more they sell, so he has heard that reporters followed the stars and cover secret contents like foreign paparazzi\u2019s.\u201cYou are working hard.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s not sarcasm, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m\u00a0serious\u2026Did I do something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, looking at your expression, you seem sincere, but I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s something I\u2019d heard from the manager of Lee Wooyeon, who I\u2019m aiming for.\u201dThe expression that she was aiming for him was a little creepy, but in a broader sense, he and reporter Kim Haeshin were comrades.Inseop murmured, and lowered his gaze.\u201cHow long has it been since you started working as manager of Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cReally?\u00a0Then take this.\u201dShe put the cigarette in her mouth, pulled out her wallet, and pulled out a business card from it.\u00a0It contained her personal contact information and email.Choi Inseop hesitated for a moment.\u00a0As a manager, receiving a business card from a reporter was not a big deal, but Kim Haeshin was a little different.\u00a0Since she was a reporter who Lee Wooyeon banned from interviewing him in person, he had no choice but to be cautious about his behavior.\u201cThank you.\u201dBut if you didn\u2019t take it here, that was a bigger problem.Inseop took Kim Haeshin\u2019s business card with both hands and bowed his head.\u201cCan\u2019t you give me your business card, manager?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201dAnd he had no intention of making it in the future.\u201cYou made the right decision.\u00a0You will be cut off before the ink on the business card dries.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re about to quit your job, just give me one phone call.\u00a0Let\u2019s do an interview with a pseudonym.\u201d\u201cIf I quit, I\u2019ll think about it then.\u201dWith an ambiguous answer that was neither negative nor positive, Inseop greeted her.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0If you think of it later, please contact me.\u201dReporter Kim Haeshin conveyed the conviction that Choi Inseop would be cut soon.\u00a0Inseop nodded his head without saying a word.Lee Wooyeon, who was holding the script in front of the set, took off his clothes and handed it to Choi Inseop as if he was waiting.\u201cI\u2019m going back to filming now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dChoi Inseop took Lee Wooyeon\u2019s clothes, folded them in half, and put them on his arms.\u00a0Then Lee Wooyeon took the clothes again.\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201dHe unfolded his clothes and put them on Inseop\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0Because of the difference in physique between the two, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s clothes covered Choi Inseop\u2019s body as if it were a hug.\u00a0He looked like a child in adult clothes, and the passing staff giggled when they saw it.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u00a0I.\u201dAs Choi Inseop hurriedly tried to take off his clothes, Lee Wooyeon pressed his hand on his shoulder.\u00a0This time, he held him with a strong grip, and Inseop led out a low and wrapped his hands around his shoulders.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Are you sick?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0no.\u201dIt hurt so much that tears came out, but Inseop raised his head while pretending to be calm.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes met his eyes.Lee Wooyeon smiled and patted his shoulder.\u201cThen wait.\u00a0Don\u2019t take the clothes off.\u00a0If you take off the coat, I will come out during filming and put it back on.\u201dLee Wooyeon said so and walked back into the filming set.\u00a0Inseop, wrapped in his coat, stood there, unable to do anything, and waited for the filming to end.It was just as Lee Wooyeon said.It was such a long day.\u201cUgh, Inseop-ah.\u201dWhen CEO Kim saw Inseop coming to the office, he was surprised and called his name.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cHey, why did you get so slim in just a few days?\u00a0Oh right.\u00a0Did Lee Wooyeon start filming?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt will be really hard.\u00a0But it will be more difficult in the future.\u201dIt was pre-filming now, so he was filming all night once every two days, but once the broadcast started, he would be fortunate to sleep even three hours a day.\u00a0Unlike Lee Wooyeon, who had steel-like stamina, Inseop was so weak that even if he only stayed up all night, it was immediately visible on his face.\u201cAre you taking the medicine I gave you well?\u00a0Eat well.\u201dManager Cha next to him also said some words as if he was worried.\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019m eating well.\u201dIt was a gift, so he couldn\u2019t throw it away, but it was a medicine he didn\u2019t want to take.\u00a0But for some reason, did Inseop take medicine after Wooyeon ate?\u00a0He was going to take the medicine.\u00a0It was an unwanted kindness.\u201c\u2026\u00a0What about Lee Wooyeon, is there anything else?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Nothing special.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u00a0Well, isn\u2019t it difficult?\u201dCEO Kim asked politely.\u00a0Whenever he had time, he called Inseop and asked if he had any difficulties or if there was anything he could do to help.\u00a0Every time he came to the office, he bought his food and sometimes gave him a bonus.Compared to the other managers, at a glance, he was being extra kind with him.\u00a0Choi Inseop felt guilty as CEO Kim was good to him, and he did his best in his work.\u00a0CEO Kim was a person who knew how to properly use reward and punishment.\u00a0He had the ability to instinctively figure out what would work for a certain person.As soon as he saw Choi Inseop, he decided to use reward tactics.\u00a0This was because a person with a weak heart like Choi Inseop tried to live up to expectations the more he does it well.\u00a0In fact, Choi Inseop met expectations and did a good job.\u00a0It was difficult to find a reason not to do well.CEO Kim wanted to somehow hold Choi Inseop next to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cTell me if it\u2019s hard.\u00a0For a day or so, Manager Cha will take care of him\u2026 Ouch!\u201dThe edge of the file folder fell on CEO Kim\u2019s feet without mercy.\u00a0As he ran around the representative room holding his feet in both hands, Manager Cha spoke calmly.\u201cSleep while you can sleep, Mr. Inseop.\u00a0And you don\u2019t have to come to the office for a while.\u00a0Why would you go to the office and waste time when you can check by email or phone?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s on the way home anyway.\u201d\u201cEven so, it\u2019s different to visit and go.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cAigoo, I guess you did not learn how to say it\u2019s not okay.\u201dIt was from a famous show program, so as soon as Manager Cha finished speaking, CEO Kim chuckled and laughed.\u00a0Manager Cha also giggled.Inseop, who had never watched a Korean show, exclaimed with a red face at the thought that he had been teased.\u201cI learned.\u00a0I know that.\u00a0I learned.\u201d\u201cReally?\u00a0Who said that? Because Inseop doesn\u2019t seem to be able to tell the difference between a real joke and a serious story.\u00a0Would you like to go to a school that separates them?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen Inseop went home today, he decided to search for the academy and register right away.\u201cThen the schedule for today ends here, right?\u00a0It\u2019s over early.\u00a0If you\u2019re going home, I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201dCEO Kim said, putting the car key in his pocket.\u00a0The last time Choi Inseop drove Lee Wooyeon home, he always parked his car in the office parking lot and walked home.\u00a0The fact that Inseop, who was busy these days, came to the office to check his schedule, meant that he took Lee Wooyeon home.\u201cNo.\u00a0I must go back.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going again?\u201d\u201cLee Wooyeon is currently working out, so I stopped by for a while.\u201d\u201cYou are you too, but Lee Wooyeon is also Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0How can he be not tired and even exercise?\u00a0He\u2019s not human.\u00a0He is a beast, a beast.\u201dManager Cha looked at CEO Kim, who badmouthed his company\u2019s entertainers as if they were others.\u201cIt\u2019s good to take good care of yourself.\u00a0CEO.\u201d\u201cAlthough it is.\u00a0There is no humanity.\u201dManager Cha smiled and pinched CEO Kim\u2019s side.\u00a0It was because he thought that Inseop, who claimed to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fan, might be offended.\u201cWhy pinch?\u00a0Did I say something wrong?\u201dManager Cha pointed to Inseop, who was quietly making a complicated expression.\u00a0Realizing his mistake, CEO Kim tried to change the topic with a broad smile.\u201cOf course, there is no humanity, but it is true that he is professional.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon is so perfect that he\u2019s not human.\u00a0I can\u2019t catch a flaw.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0He is.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s expression darkened even more.\u00a0He was a person who devoted everyday to finding Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fault.\u201cHahaha.\u00a0Okay.\u00a0Our Inseop.\u00a0It takes a lot of hard work to be the perfect celebrity manager.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all good because it\u2019s what I love to do.\u00a0Then I\u2019ll just go.\u00a0Good-bye.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Do your best.\u201d\u201cSee you next time.\u201dInseop greeted the two of them and left the office.In fact, he still had a lot of time before Lee Wooyeon\u2019s workout was over, but it was time to close the office, so he couldn\u2019t stay there forever.Most of all, the problem was that people who were kind to him were getting better and better.\u00a0As the day cleared, Inseop felt distressed because it seemed that his heart would be relieved at the same time.\u00a0He desperately wanted to finish his revenge before spring came and return to America.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll go to sleep.\u00a0At this time.\u201dLee Wooyeon tapped the clock with the tip of his finger, it was well past midnight.\u00a0Choi Inseop held the steering wheel of the van and glanced at Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting next to him.\u00a0After taking a shower at the fitness center, his wet bangs were covering his forehead.\u00a0Whenever Lee Wooyeon moved, the strong smell of shampoo dispersed in the car.\u201c\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop looked at the back seat and Lee Wooyeon alternately.\u00a0It was an unspoken urge asking him to go back.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLee Wooyeon fastened his seat belt.\u00a0It was an expression like he did not want to go back.\u00a0Inseop sighed and started pulling out the car slowly.\u00a0As he left the parking lot and drove down the road, Choi Inseop pressed the play button on the audio and turned up the volume.It was the usual seat position that blocked the silence in the car.\u00a0However, when they were sitting side by side like this, he was so worried that he could not concentrate on driving.\u00a0At times like these, it was best to turn the music up loud.\u201cHistoria de un amor.\u201dLee Wooyeon tilted his head slightly and muttered the name of the song.\u201cThis song.\u00a0Historia de un amor.\u00a0What a love story.\u00a0It\u2019s my favorite song.\u201d\u201cYes, I know\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop bit his lip without talking.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s soft laugh mixed with the female singer\u2019s voice and echoed in the car.\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Because I am a fan.\u201d\u201cReally?\u00a0Did I say that on TV?\u00a0I can\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cOne day, just a passing word\u2026\u00a0\u201dActually, he didn\u2019t hear it on the radio or on TV.\u00a0So Inseop strangely obscured the source of the story.\u201cYou have a good memory.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cJust trying.\u201dChoi Inseop always wrote down things to remember.\u00a0The daily routine was meticulously organized in a notebook.\u00a0It was a daily routine and a habit.\u00a0Today\u2019s diary was all about Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He wrote down all the details about Lee Wooyeon in a notebook, enough to be mistaken for a stalker\u2019s diary if anyone saw it.\u201cYou are working hard for me.\u00a0It feels good.\u201dWhen the sound of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words reached him, his ears lit up.It was for Jenny\u2019s sake, but it was not easy to deceive someone in this way.\u00a0It felt like his shaky conscience was being stabbed with the tip of a knife.\u201cDo you know the lyrics to this song?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was looking at the manager holding the steering wheel with a complicated face, suddenly asked.\u201cOnly\u2026\u201d\u201cIt made me understand all good and evil and gave me a light in my life, but now I just turn it off.\u201dLee Wooyeon interpreted the lyrics to the song that was playing.Inseop breathed in as if to stop breathing.\u00a0Even though he knew that Lee Wooyeon was not that kind of person, his heart raced at the sweet voice that came out of his mouth.\u201cOh, my life is really dark. I can\u2019t live without your love.\u201dAfter completing the interpretation of the lyrics of the song, Lee Wooyeon turned his head to Inseop.\u201cDo you understand how someone cannot live without the other\u2019s love?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0well.\u201dThere were days when he understood.\u00a0But not now.\u00a0Now, he didn\u2019t want to understand how they were going to live and die for love.\u201cIt\u2019s quite something.\u00a0I really don\u2019t understand that.\u201dLee Wooyeon continued speaking with his voice low as if he was telling a great secret.\u201cThe role I\u2019m playing this time will eventually die because of love.\u00a0But even if I read the script dozens of times, it\u2019s not really easy to understand.\u00a0It\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 It\u2019s a big problem.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who heard Inseop\u2019s answer, laughed out loud.\u201cHahaha.\u00a0Yes.\u00a0That\u2019s a big problem.\u00a0But don\u2019t people usually comfort someone by saying that it\u2019s okay?\u00a0You can do it, or something.\u00a0Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201dPerhaps the answer from the manager was interesting, Lee Wooyeon never stopped laughing.\u00a0He raised his shoulders and laughed until the light changed and he turned right.\u201cI think Inseop is a fun person the more I know him.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dIt felt complicated.\u00a0He felt like he was being teased, so he couldn\u2019t even say thank you\u2026\u00a0Oh, he thought he should go home quickly and register for that academy.\u00a0No, if it was like this, even if he registered for an academy, he won\u2019t have time to attend.While Inseop was thinking about various things, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cell phone rang.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said, \u201cHold on for a moment,\u201d and politely apologized and answered the call.It was fast and fluent English.\u00a0Perhaps he thought Inseop, who was sitting next to him, couldn\u2019t understand, and he made the call without hesitation.<I sent you a montage. Make sure to find out and call me back. I hope we can talk on the phone next time with good news.>He couldn\u2019t hear what the other side was saying, but it was certain that Lee Wooyeon was looking for someone.\u00a0After a few more words, he hung up.\u00a0Inseop began to guess in his head who Lee Wooyeon was looking for.After finishing the phone call, Lee Wooyeon glanced at the side view of the manager who was driving.\u00a0Inseop, who looked like he was thinking hard on his own, but didn\u2019t ask questions, was now considered peculiar.\u201cWhat time do I have to come down tomorrow?\u201dLee Wooyeon hadn\u2019t checked his schedule these days.\u00a0In the past, he had to check every single detail to manipulate the schedule to fuck with\u00a0 the manager, but he gave up after realizing that it was impossible with Choi Inseop.\u00a0This was because Inseop went directly to the office and received the schedule from the person in charge of the schedule.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t mess around in the middle.\u00a0In order to cut Choi Inseop, he needed a different method from other people.\u201cFive thirty.\u201d\u201cThen, when do you sleep, Mr. Inseop?\u00a0Do you have office hours?\u201dTomorrow, they have to start filming early in the morning, so they had to start earlier than other times.\u00a0Inseop took Lee Wooyeon home because of the preparation time, and then he had less than two hours to go home and sleep.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be okay.\u00a0How long does it take to get home by car?\u201d\u201cI do not know.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cI park the car in the office and walk.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dThe office was located in the middle of Choi Inseop\u2019s house and Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house, but it wasn\u2019t a walkable distance every day.\u201cThere is no space to park the car.\u00a0It\u2019s an expensive car and it\u2019s big\u2026\u201dThe van that Choi Inseop was driving now cost more than 100 million won.\u00a0If anything happened after parking it anywhere, it was not an amount that Inseop could afford.\u201cDo you walk like that every morning?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Exercise is good too\u2026\u00a0We\u2019re here.\u201dInseop said as he parked the car.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon did not intend to get out of the car.\u201cWould you like to go to my house and sleep?\u00a0Just park the car here.\u00a0I have to leave early in the morning.\u201dHe asked out of courtesy. He did not have a hobby of bringing men or women into his house.But did that asshole manager turn red to the nape of his neck and hurriedly waved his hands?\u00a0Like a virgin who hated that he accepted an offer to sleep with a pervert.That hurt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s feelings.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0I will just go home.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0You\u2019re tired from going back and forth.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u00a0The house is comfortable.\u201dIn other words, it meant that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house was uncomfortable.\u00a0He got impatient.\u00a0The behavior of the manager who drew a strange line against him strangely angered him.\u201cSleep at my house.\u201dAt this point, he was getting tired.Lee Wooyeon smiled kindly and held out his hand to the manager.\u00a0But the manager didn\u2019t even budge.\u201cNo.\u00a0I have work to do when I get home, and I have to give Kate some water\u2026\u201dInseop, who was speaking, quickly shut his mouth.\u201cKate?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0good bye.\u201dInseop reached out and opened the door of the passenger seat where Lee Wooyeon was sitting.\u00a0But Lee Wooyeon slammed the door shut.\u201cWho is Kate?\u201dChoi Inseop was perplexed.How can he say that he missed people so much that he bought plants, gave them names, and talked to them?\u201cShe\u2019s just an acquaintance.\u201dWhen he uttered the word \u201cperson,\u201d Inseop shrugged his shoulders and set his gaze elsewhere.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon intuitively recognized that he was lying.\u00a0However, the point he observed the lie was that it was not just a person but an acquaintance.\u201cReally?\u00a0You\u2019re meeting them this late.\u00a0Is she waiting at home? Kate?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dIt was surprising.\u00a0Last time it was Jenny, this time it was Kate.Lee Wooyeon looked at the manager who was struggling, as if scared and not knowing what to do.\u00a0He looked like a fool who didn\u2019t know anything besides looking here and there, but he couldn\u2019t believe he was living with a western woman.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you don\u2019t have a girlfriend?\u00a0Or is it just like that?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing like that\u2026\u201dLiving with someone who was not his lover.It was getting progressively worse.Lee Wooyeon looked at Choi Inseop\u2019s trembling face that looked like he was saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then see you tomorrow morning.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and opened the car door.\u00a0And before Inseop could answer, he closed the car door aloud and disappeared.Choi Inseop said, \u201cAh,\u201d and scratched his head.\u00a0It seemed that Lee Wooyeon was not in a good mood, but he could not figure out the reason why he was angry.\u201cWhat\u2026\u00a0what else have I done?\u201dAfter all, the conversation should have been in a short-answer format.\u00a0The longer the words, the more mistakes.He sighed and slowly backed up the car.\u00a0It was about a 10-minute drive from where Lee Wooyeon lived to the office.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

always parked and turned off the ignition, the phone rang.\u00a0It was text\u201cWho is it?\u201dThe moment he checked the text message on his cell phone, Inseop doubted his own eyes.\u00a0The sender of the text was Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI have an important request, so please come now.\u201dIt was rare for the word \u201crequest\u201d to come out of Lee wooyeon\u2019s mouth, but when the word \u201cimportant\u201d was added in front of it, it seemed that something had happened.Choi Inseop hesitated.\u00a0If he went to Lee Wooyeon now, he would have had to change clothes without sleeping for even an hour.\u00a0He could also pretend that he didn\u2019t see the text message.\u00a0However, Inseop thought that Lee Wooyeon must have a reason for calling him.Inseop started the car again.\u00a0He parked the car and took the elevator up to the floor where Lee Wooyeon lived.When he rang the doorbell, Lee Wooyeon opened the door without asking who it was.\u201cSorry.\u00a0You must be tired.\u201dThere was no sign of urgency unlike the text message he sent at this time to ask for help on the smiling face.\u201cNo.\u00a0What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cCome in at once.\u201dLee Wooyeon stepped aside, telling him to come inside.\u00a0Choi Inseop hesitated for a moment, then entered the front door.\u00a0This was the fourth time he had been to this house.\u00a0It was easy to get used to, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous every time he came in.Taking off his shoes, Inseop thought it was fortunate that he came wearing clean socks today.\u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t give anything to my guest, I would feel sorry\u00a0Can I get you some juice?\u201d\u201cThen I would like a glass of water, please.\u201dLee Wooyeon took water from the refrigerator.\u00a0Inseop took the cup with both hands and said thank you.\u00a0After taking a sip of water, Inseop asked him why he called him.\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cCan you give me a shoulder massage?\u00a0My shoulders are tight, but I can\u2019t reach them.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s absurd request, Inseop made a bewildered expression for a moment, then sighed and approached behind him.\u201cWhere are you uncomfortable?\u201dWith a small fist slightly clenched and a serious face asking, Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter and bent down.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0Sorry.\u00a0Do you really think I would have called my manager to give me a shoulder massage?\u201d\u201c\u2026 you didn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cDo you think I look like that kind of asshole?\u201dIt was a voice that sounded friendly even when he cursed.\u00a0As Choi Inseop could not answer and stood muttering, Lee Wooyeon approached him and stretched out his hand.\u00a0Every time he touched his body, he felt Inseop twitch.Lee Wooyeon smiled and picked up the script that was on the table.\u201cPlease read the opposite.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trying to rehearse the scene for tomorrow, but I can\u2019t feel my emotions.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0So, are you asking me to read the lines of the other actors?\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s expression hardened coldly.\u00a0It was as if he had heard a curse that he shouldn\u2019t have heard.\u201cYes.\u00a0That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cSomeone like me\u2026 do you think it will help?\u201d\u201cI called you because I thought you would be helpful.\u201dLee Wooyeon answered shamelessly and sat down on the sofa.\u00a0Choi Inseop stood with the script and looked at Lee Wooyeon.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I\u2019m serious.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t gone to an academy that helped him distinguish between jokes and seriousness, but now he knew that those words were sincere.\u00a0Inseop had no choice but to open the script.\u201cSit down, here.\u201d\u201cI will stand.\u201d\u201cSit down please.\u00a0It must be difficult.\u201dLee Wooyeon forcibly grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand and pulled him to sit next to him.\u00a0Inseop deliberately pretended that nothing was wrong and fumbled through the script and asked.\u201cWhere do we start?\u201dSeeing him looking at the script with a serious expression, Wooyeon had to hold back his laughter.\u00a0Anyone would be annoyed if he called them to read a script at this time, but Inseop didn\u2019t have that.There was a plan, but basically the person named Choi Inseop had a good personality.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was watching what Choi Inseop was thinking as his manager, caught his eye these days.He suddenly thought that it would be great to get rid of the unexplained plan.\u00a0If he fully poured his loyalty into himself like a kind person, he can use him for a long time as CEO Kim said.But for some reason, Choi Inseop\u2019s attitude was very questionable.\u201cFrom there on page 8, line 5.\u00a0Would you like to read it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop\u2019s face, who was holding the script, went hazy.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pretended not to notice and urged him.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s eyes turned red.\u00a0He looked like he was about to cry.\u201cFrom here.\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed out which lines to read with his fingers, but Inseop couldn\u2019t speak easily.\u00a0Hesitating, he cast a hesitant look at Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I\u2026\u00a0This\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cAs I said before, I have a weak understanding of love.\u00a0It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been in a proper relationship because I\u2019ve been busy with acting.\u00a0It\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was nothing wrong with Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words.\u00a0He did not have a proper relationship, but he just met girls.\u201cSo please help me.\u201dIt was a polite but earnest request.\u00a0Choi Inseop had to recheck the lines that Lee Wooyeon pointed with his finger.\u00a0Just reading it with his eyes seemed to raise his body temperature by several degrees.\u00a0The line that started with the master was followed by embarrassing words.\u00a0The lines made up of elegant old sayings were as sweet as the scent of flowers.\u00a0No matter how many times Inseop read it, he didn\u2019t have the courage to say it out loud.As Choi Inseop sighed, Lee Wooyeon blinked slowly and asked him.\u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can just read it.\u00a0Like you bought a coffee machine and were reading the instruction manual.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if any coffee machine instruction manual contained the phrase, \u2018Master, please understand my heart\u2019, but Inseop decided to think about it that way for now.\u201cyoung\u2026mas\u2026\u00a0ter.\u201dIt felt like a hundred eons had passed before he could say that one word.\u00a0He felt a cold sweat.\u201cWhat next?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Can\u2019t we just go ahead with what I said?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t.\u00a0Then I would\u2019ve done it alone. Why would I request the manager for help in the middle of the night?\u00a0Please.\u00a0Read.\u201dWhen the word \u201crequest\u201d came out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth, Inseop let out a big sigh.\u00a0He had never felt as arduous as today. He opened his eyes and stared at the script.\u00a0Just reading the letters on the paper made the hairs on his body stand up.\u201cYoung\u2026\u00a0young master.\u00a0Girl\u2026\u00a0in the mind of\u00a0\u2026\u00a0so that day\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0From that day\u2026\u201dInseop stuttered and read the lines like a child who first learned Korean.\u00a0It was pitiful how much he stuttered and his voice trembled.Lee Wooyeon looked at the script with a serious expression on his face.Calling Choi Inseop back to his house was ridiculous even now.As soon as the face of the manager, who had been trying to go to his house where a bitch named Kate was waiting, came to mind, Lee Wooyeon felt annoyed.\u00a0He didn\u2019t like the manager\u2019s choice to go home to her to spend less than two hours with her.He was putting up with Choi Inseop, who had a plan, but he was going to give the woman water?\u00a0The most disturbing thing was that he had said that he was going to water her in front of him.\u00a0Inseop, who looked clueless and used such vulgar expressions, offended the mood of Wooyeon.As soon as he imagined the scene where the innocent manager gasped in front of the body of a woman, he texted Inseop to come here.\u00a0He was going to send him home after disciplining the son of a bitch a few times, but when I saw Inseop trembling like a drowning puppy, he changed his mind.All night long, he\u2019ll have to read the script.\u201cRead more.\u00a0There\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I can\u2019t.\u201dInseop put the script down on his lap and wept.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon felt better whenever Choi Inseop cried.\u00a0He liked that close-up look that looked like he was going to burst into tears at any moment.He preferred a frown on the other person\u2019s smile if he had to hide his anger. His expressions of sadness, pain, or distress caught his attention.He overheard his doctor explaining to his parents that it was a common occurrence for antisocial disorder and sadistic tendencies to coexist.\u00a0He said he was still young, so he couldn\u2019t make a diagnosis, so he told her to keep an eye on him.His mother, who had grown up without any resentment, came to the bedside of her sleeping son every night and cried and prayed.\u00a0She wanted her son to get better.Every time her son showed a different side from others, his mother held his hands and told him over and over again.\u00a0It\u2019s not that he was bad, it was that he had a disease in his mind.\u00a0Just as the body suffers from diseases, the mind also suffers, but this was by no means a bad thing.\u00a0It was a little worse than the others, but he can fix it, so not to worry, his mother used to tell him as if she was making a promise to herself.As a child, he listened to his mother and thought.\u2018So, does that mean my mind is sick?\u00a0Fuck, what a relief.\u00a0It\u2019s hard to hide physical pain!\u2019From that time on, he began to observe and imitate the attitudes of ordinary people.\u00a0The habit of the body made Lee Wooyeon who he is today, but he could not completely erase his natural tendency.He felt good when he looked up at Choi Inseop who had an expression that said he was uncomfortable.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s brown eyes with slightly raised eyebrows made Lee Wooyeon satisfied.Like now.\u201cYou can just read it.\u00a0You know how to read Korean.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think that you\u2019re saying it, just read it.\u00a0It\u2019s convenient if you think you\u2019re reading to someone other than me.\u00a0Like Eunbyul.\u201dInseop read the lines in the script again and took a deep breath.Choi Eunbyeol, who took on the role of Lee Soohyun, who was the opposite of Lee Wooyeon, was a new actress who had just turned 20.\u00a0Because of her excellent acting skills in the Oriental Beauty Award, she received people\u2019s attention when she was cast for the role of Soohyeon.\u00a0Lee Soohyeon, played by Choi Eunbyeol, was Lee Wonsik\u2019s younger sister, and was not the traditional female figure of the Joseon Dynasty, but an enterprising woman.\u00a0She was the heroine who actively confesses her love to Kim Youngha, played by Choi Inseop, expresses her heart, and creates her own destiny.\u00a0Conservative Kim Youngha initially resented her, but gradually opened up to her, but eventually came to a tragic end due to differences in status and faction problems.\u201cHave you seen Eunbyul acting?\u00a0You can think of that image and do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dLooking at Lee Wooyeon, he remembered the face of the actor who played the role that ended in a tragic love.\u00a0It became even more difficult to read the lines.Inseop licked his lips a few times and finally shook his head.\u201cSorry. Really\u2026 I can\u2019t.\u201dWhen he was in school in the United States, he participated in a play only once.\u00a0It was the role of a standing waving leave from behind without dialogue.\u00a0In fact, there was one line, but the teacher removed the line in consideration for him, who was shaking like an aspen tree.\u201cReally?\u00a0Then there is nothing we can do.\u201dLee Wooyeon showed a slight disappointment and put the script in Choi Inseop\u2019s hand on the table.\u201cI\u2019m going to be a little lost tomorrow.\u00a0I can\u2019t sleep all night, so I\u2019ll have to practice the script.\u00a0Then go in first.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and said.\u00a0With that lonely smile, Inseop couldn\u2019t get up from the sofa.\u00a0Whatever the reason, he had to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s capable manager now.\u201cYou may go, Mr.\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry for asking too much.\u201dLee Wooyeon was a natural actor.\u00a0With that single word, it naturally made the other person feel remorse.\u201c\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that\u2026 excuse me\u2026\u00a0then\u2026\u00a0I\u2019ll do it.\u201dInstead, Choi Inseop immediately added a condition.\u201cI will look back.\u00a0I hope Lee Wooyeon will turn around as well.\u201dThat was the greatest consideration that Inseop could do.Just reading the lines made him cringe to death, but it was impossible to do this face to face with someone.Besides, it was Lee Wooyeon, not someone else.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t say anything to confess his love for Lee Wooyeon.\u201cAre you going to do facing back?\u201dIt was a disappointing proposal for Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He wanted to see the scene where Inseop trembled and spit out girlish lines that didn\u2019t suit him.\u201cYes\u2026\u00a0If you\u2019re okay with this.\u201dIf he spoke with his back turned, he could have imagined that it was not Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Inseop believed so.\u201cIf Inseop is like that, I can\u2019t do anything.\u201dLee Wooyeon sat down with Inseop\u2019s back turned away from him\u00a0Choi Inseop picked up the script on the table.\u201cFrom the beginning of page 3.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dIt was better not to see each other face to face.\u00a0Inseop thought that the person behind him was someone other than Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0At times like this, he was grateful for his rich imagination.Inseop read the lines slowly, as written in the script, in a dry tone like a person reading a coffee machine instruction manual.\u201cThe Threefold Path says that a virtuous woman should follow, but the girl\u2026\u201dInseop coughed in vain.\u201cThe girl has already decided in her heart who she wants to follow.\u00a0So, my brother\u2026\u201d\u201cWonshik, are you there?\u201dInseop couldn\u2019t help but be surprised by the voice he heard from behind.\u00a0It was said that historical dramas differ from modern dramas in the tone and vocalization of their voices, but when he listened to them so closely, he felt like a completely different person.Kim Youngha, not Lee Wooyeon, was behind him.\u201cSkip the line of Mr. Kang Youngmo.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dInseop eagerly began to find his lines and read them.\u201cDo, the master\u2026\u201dEven if he tried to think that he was just reading a novel, he was worried about the name Lee Wooyeon called behind his back, so he started stuttering again.\u201cUh, for some reason, I\u2019m here\u2026\u201d\u201cThe next line is from Kang Youngmo, so I\u2019ll move on.\u201dA strong voice followed the soft voice.\u201cI\u2019ve come to you with something to share with you.\u201dFrom then on, it was a scene where Kang Youngmo and Lee Wooyeon had a verbal battle.\u00a0Inseop, wondering what to do now, held his breath and waited for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s instructions.\u201cThe lines start on page 5.\u201dInseop hurriedly turned over the script.\u00a0From there, it was a scene where the two shared their hearts in the backyard.\u201cGi, girl\u2026, gi, girl\u2026\u201dThe person behind his back is not Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0It\u2019s not Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Not Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u00a0Even though it was Kim Youngha, his heart was pounding.\u00a0His tongue did not move freely.\u00a0Inseop sweated and read the lines slowly.His stuttering can be frustrating, but Lee Wooyeon quietly waited for Inseop\u2019s line to end.\u201cThe girl\u2026\u00a0 Ma, Master\u2026 Le, let me tell you\u2026\u201d\u201cI will be waiting here, so please speak slowly.\u201dInseop felt guilty as he suddenly seemed to have made the other person\u2019s role stutter.\u00a0He doubted whether reading these lines would be of any help.\u201cI have someone in my heart\u2026\u201dHe could feel Lee Wooyeon slowly nodding his head from behind.\u00a0It was a move according to the script.\u00a0Choi Inseop read the lines written in the script.\u00a0It was a scene where Soohyeon showed the thimble she received from Youngha when she was young and said that there is only one Jeongin in her heart.\u201cThis insignificant thimble is a sign that my heart belongs to him.\u201dHaving said that, he had to smile while putting the thimble into his finger.It was nothing but a line.\u00a0He could read the text without emotion, but his hands were shaking.\u00a0Choi Inseop grabbed the script with all his might.\u00a0I thought it was fortunate that Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting back to back, did not see that his hand was shaking.He was hopeless.\u00a0Sitting like that, with a cold sweat from a single line with no meaning.Reading this didn\u2019t mean he was speaking his heart.\u2018No, my heart is already dead\u2026\u2019\u201cYou can read the next line.\u201dHis face heated up at the calming voice he heard from behind.\u00a0It sounded like an interrogation to reveal the truth quickly, so he couldn\u2019t even raise his head.Why the hell was he here?\u00a0Maybe he was fulfilling his greed under the pretext of sacrificing for Jenny.Inseop stared at the letters on the script.\u00a0He held back tears from welling up.These words were not his heart.\u00a0His heart was no longer here.Because he had to hate Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0No, because he hated him.Suppressing his emotions as much as possible, Inseop read the lines.\u201cThis insignificant thimble is my heart\u2026\u00a0uh\u2026?\u201dThe next words did not continue.\u00a0Choi Inseop quickly covered his nose with his palm and tilted his head back.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon turned around.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u00a0Do you have a nose bleed?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t tilt your head like that.\u201dLee Wooyeon took a tissue and put it under Inseop\u2019s nose and said.\u201cThe blood runs all the way back.\u00a0Lean forward like this.\u201dChoi Inseop bowed his head forward as Lee Wooyeon told him.\u00a0Dark red blood quickly dripped onto the tissue.\u201cI;m sorry.\u00a0On the script\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop pointed to the blood that had fallen on the script.\u201cIf you have time to worry about that, take more care of yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIf you say you\u2019re sorry one more time, I won\u2019t make you the fan club president.\u201dMaking light threats mixed with jokes, Lee Wooyeon pulled out more tissues and wiped Inseop\u2019s face.\u201cI am\u2026\u201d\u201cStay still.\u00a0The blood is still flowing.\u201dInseop quietly waited for the nosebleed to stop.\u00a0It was a nosebleed after a long time.\u00a0In the past, there were times when he woke up with a nosebleed and his pillow was soaked with blood.\u201cIt still hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cLie down.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s shoulder and pulled him back.\u201cNo, just\u2026\u201d\u201cLie on your side.\u00a0Like this.\u201dIt was impossible to overcome Lee Wooyeon by force.\u00a0Inseop was forced to lay down on the sofa.\u201cAre you tired?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dIt was probably a mental stress issue rather than fatigue.\u00a0Inseop had always been like that.\u00a0The next day, when he had an important exam or something he didn\u2019t want to do, he would have a nosebleed.\u201cYou know what doesn\u2019t look all right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYour face has turned white, your eyes are puffy, and your nose is bleeding.\u00a0Isn\u2019t this how Inseop will fall?\u00a0I don\u2019t know if I should ask to change you with someone else.\u201d\u201cNo!\u00a0You can\u2019t.\u201dInseop jumped up and desperately insisted that he was okay.\u201cThe nosebleed is not because of tiredness, but because of stress.\u00a0It\u2019s really ok.\u00a0I can work.\u201d\u201cStress?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cDo you bleed when you are stressed?\u00a0So reading the script here right now was very stressful, you mean?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u201d\u201cIn what scene?\u00a0The scene here where you put the thimble on your finger and kiss the cheek?\u00a0Or is it the scene of hugging Kim Youngha\u2019s back as he turns around?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Are there scenes like that?\u201dThe nosebleed, which had barely stopped, dripped again.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue, pressed Inseop\u2019s nose with a tissue, and laid him down on the sofa.Inseop closed his eyes as Lee Wooyeon looked down at him.\u00a0He was terribly ashamed.\u00a0The fact that he was stressed enough to bleed from just reading the script.\u00a0And the fact that he recognized Lee Wooyeon as well.It was miserable because the harder he tried, the more messy it seemed.\u00a0As he closed his eyes, he felt a rush of tiredness that he had forgotten.\u201cBut when you\u2019re really stressed, does your nose bleed?\u201d\u201c\u2026sometimes.\u201dHe used to get nosebleeds a lot when he was a teenager, but as an adult he didn\u2019t bleed so much that he forgot that he had this condition.\u00a0He thought it was a thing of the past, but over and over, the old faces of Peter suddenly appeared here.Choi Inseop had to admit that he was now confined to his mental limit.\u00a0It was so lonely.\u00a0It was lonely and difficult, so he was mentally exhausted enough to want anyone to be by his side.\u00a0The energy left in his body was used to hate Lee Wooyeon, so he didn\u2019t even have the strength to lift a finger.Tiring.As soon as he realized that, fatigue came over him like death.\u201cDid you hate coming here?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the manager\u2019s duty, something like that.\u00a0When I called at this hour, you didn\u2019t want to come, did you?\u201dNormally he would have answered no.\u00a0It\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s not a big deal if he didn\u2019t sleep for a day, and that he could endure even more difficult tasks.\u00a0He had to say it was nothing.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u00a0I hated it.\u201dWhen the honest answer came, Lee Wooyeon smiled a little.\u00a0Inseop wondered what kind of expression he was making.\u00a0He had to open his eyes and look at him, but lifting his eyelids was so difficult that it seemed impossible now.\u201cWhy are you sitting still when you\u2019re stressed out like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt would be nice if that could be the case\u2026 He wanted to leave.\u00a0He wanted to go out\u2026\u00a0But why does Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice sound so sweet?\u00a0He loved it\u2026Due to extreme fatigue, Inseop could not contain the thoughts that came to his head and left him there.\u201cYou can leave.\u201dLee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s shoulder with the palm of his hand and continued.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it that much, you can just turn your back and walk away.\u201dIt was a soft voice, as if whispering a lullaby into a baby\u2019s ear.\u00a0Every time Lee Wooyeon touched his palm, he could feel Inseop\u2019s shoulder twitch.\u00a0So he didn\u2019t stop patting.From the day that Lee Wooyeon realized that the way he felt was different from other people, he made no effort to understand others.\u00a0It was enough to memorize behaviors that were not understood.However, the person named Choi Inseop was someone he could not understand.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t figure out whether he liked him or hated him.\u00a0He was too sacrificial to a person he didn\u2019t like, and his attitude toward him was disappointing for a person he did like.He thought he would be able to distinguish them clearly if he put them next to each other, but it became increasingly difficult to judge them.The fact that the manager, who was so sacrificial that he ran here without expressing disgust at a single text message, was so stressed that he had a nosebleed made him feel uncomfortable.He felt like he was in a bad mood.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u00a0If you don\u2019t like it that much, just quit and leave.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s slender shoulder with the palm of his hand, as if hugging him.If Choi Inseop said he was leaving, he was going to fire him today.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to hold onto someone who hated him so much.He liked that Choi Inseop made a troubled expression towards him or felt embarrassed, but he didn\u2019t want him to seriously hate himHe knew it didn\u2019t exactly make sense, but it did.Lee Wooyeon was determined to get rid of Inseop before it got more complicated.\u00a0It was a pity that he\u2019ll miss coffee and food brought in every morning according to his taste, and perfect song selection that seemed to fit the mood of the day.\u00a0Also the meticulous workmanship that never made a single mistake.Most of all, it was a pity that he could not see the big, frightened eyes that looked carefully at him again.\u00a0But he hated him so much, he didn\u2019t need to be patient anymore.\u201cYou can answer honestly.\u201dHowever, the answer did not come back after a long time.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Are you still thinking?\u201dLee Wooyeon bowed his head and looked at the manager\u2019s face.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t long before Inseop, who he thought had just closed his eyes, confirmed that he had fallen asleep.Amazing.How could a person who was bleeding due to stress fall asleep in such a situation?\u201chaha\u2026\u00a0 Ha ha ha ha ha\u2026 haha, \u2026Well, this bastard.\u201dThe laughter didn\u2019t stop.\u00a0It was just absurd to be in an unpredictable situation.He got up from his seat and swallowed a smirk\u00a0, then looked at the manager\u2019s face again.\u00a0He felt like an idiot for thinking about things that were not right for even a moment.\u201cFuck, Choi Inseop\u2026!\u201dLee Wooyeon stretched out his hand to wake Choi Inseop from sleep, and then opened his eyes slightly.\u00a0Choi Inseop was crying.\u00a0His long eyelashes were tangled with tears.It was a pitiful appearance that aroused cruel curiosity.Lee Wooyeon suddenly remembered the poor puppy he had picked up out of curiosity when he was young.\u00a0It was not known whether it had been abandoned or left the house, but the dog, deprived of love, was trembling with fear.\u00a0He was intrigued by the little creature\u2019s grunt, trying to get sympathy for his existence.But the curiosity didn\u2019t last long.\u00a0The dog had been crying all night and had trouble sleeping.\u00a0Eventually, at dawn, he took the dog and put it back where he had found it.\u00a0The next morning he went to the place where his sister was having a riot and found the dog dead.\u00a0He was not surprised.\u00a0Because it was a natural result.\u00a0It was raining and it was a cold day, so it was quite predictable.But within that day, the younger sister cried as if the world had ended.\u00a0Besides, the younger brother shouted that his brother had killed the dog.He did not fully understand his sister\u2019s accusations against him.It wasn\u2019t his fault, and it was the criticism that he couldn\u2019t understand at all about what a big problem it would be to put back something that he had been holding for a while.In the end, his sister did not speak to him for a month after that day.\u00a0He also had to listen to a lot of admonitions about responsibility from his parents.There was definitely a lesson to be learned at that time.\u2018Do not pick up anything on the road.\u00a0And once you pick it up, you must not let it go until you die due to the problem of responsibility.\u2019The problem was that his curiosity quickly cooled as he waited for the animal to die naturally.\u00a0The only way to get rid of boredom was to kill animals.\u00a0However, he never picked up an animal after that day, knowing that the nagging and post-processing that followed would be a nuisance after killing an animal.\u00a0Even when he was dating a woman or sleeping with them, he never did anything that made him responsible.Seeing the manager crumpled up like a mop and sleeping on the sofa, Lee Wooyeon remembered the wet dog crying in the rain.\u00a0He memorized the human face.\u00a0He did not forget the expression he had seen once because it was a training he had been repeating since he was young.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know if he knew, but that was exactly what Choi Inseop was feeling right now.\u00a0The fear of a young puppy abandoned by the world.Seeing the manager sleeping on the sofa trembling, Lee Wooyeon thought.\u2018Did I pick up another son of a bitch?\u2019A complex emotion, neither particularly pleasant nor unpleasant, crossed over him.The good news was that this bastard was trembling with fear, but didn\u2019t cry.Instead of waking him up, he wiped the tears from Inseop\u2019s eyes.\u00a0Choi Inseop curled up like a shrimp and wrapped his hands around his shoulders.\u201c\u2026\u00a0chu\u2026\u201dIn his sleep, Inseop muttered a little and crouched down.Lee Wooyeon took a blanket from the bedroom and put it over Choi Inseop\u2019s body.\u00a0Now it was the best kindness one could give to a puppy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext

For\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, doesn\u2019t this kind of thing come in a lot?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0A lot comes in.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was rumored not to receive gifts from fans, did not pay much attention to the lunch boxes that came in during filming, as these were returned to the staff and the people around them.\u00a0Of course, he didn\u2019t even speak.\u201cI envy you.\u00a0Because you can eat delicious things like this often.\u201d\u201cWould you like some?\u201dInseop held out the remaining lunchbox to Eunyoung.\u201cReally?\u00a0Can I really eat?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0There\u2019s two left.\u00a0It\u2019s great.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to throw it away.\u201d\u201cThen I will eat it without hesitating.\u00a0I was getting a little tired of the food from the food truck.\u201dShe smiled and accepted the lunch box.\u00a0Inseop broke the wooden chopsticks and handed them to her.\u201cThank you.\u00a0Wow, it\u2019s delicious.\u00a0Free rice\u00a0Free rice.\u201dSeeing that she liked it, Inseop burst into laughter.\u00a0He had always liked seeing someone eat delicious food.\u00a0He stopped eating and watched the scene where Eunyoung ate her lunch box with his chin on his hand.\u201cWhyat?\u00a0Have you never seen a fat woman eat rice?\u00a0Am I eating too much?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u00a0It tastes good and it looks good.\u201d\u201cJust joking.\u00a0Hehehe.\u00a0I eat really well.\u00a0My mom said that just looking at what I eat makes her stomach bloated.\u201d\u201cYou look good.\u201dChoi Inseop said with a smile.\u201cLooking at it, I think Inseop\u2019s taste is very unique.\u00a0Last time he looked at me and said I was pretty.\u201d\u201cWhat about that?\u00a0Eating well is a good thing to look at, and women are naturally pretty.\u201dLee Eunyoung looked at Choi Inseop blankly.\u00a0There was no pretense or falsehood in hiss face as he spoke like that.\u201cWow\u2026\u00a0a man who thinks like this still exists in Korea.\u201dWhen she saw Inseop, she was truly amazed.\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\u201cI think you grew up receiving a lot of love from my parents.\u00a0Right?\u201d\u201cI did, but\u2026 am I weird?\u201d\u201cNo!\u00a0You\u2019re not weird.\u00a0I wish all Korean men would think that way.\u00a0Then I wouldn\u2019t have to go on a diet either.\u201dAs she ate her lunch again, she murmured over and over again.\u201cBecause women in my country are all too thin.\u00a0Do you know that\u00a070% of Korean women think they are fat, and 70% of men think that it is okay if they do this.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u00a0Then I belong to the 30%.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Inseop is fine.\u201d\u201cI am?\u00a0No way.\u201dHe had a skinny body, a white face with freckles, and his eyes were as big as a frightened puppy.\u00a0Inseop thought that there was nothing in his appearance that could appeal to a woman.\u201cNo.\u00a0Sincerity.\u00a0If it\u2019s Mr. Inseop, it\u2019s really good.\u00a0Don\u2019t you have a girlfriend yet?\u00a0Would you like me to introduce you to a pretty girl among the younger people I know?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0That\u2019s okay.\u201dInseop frowned and waved his hand.\u201cWhy?\u00a0They\u2019re really pretty.\u00a0They don\u2019t look like me.\u00a0There are a lot of pretty and slender dongsaengs among the kids I go to acting school with.\u201d\u201cNo, not for that reason, I\u2026 I can\u2019t afford to date people yet.\u201dThere was not enough time to go after Lee Wooyeon and pursue him.\u00a0He was busy enough that he prayed that a day would be thirty-six hours.And, above all, after work, he had to return to the United States.\u00a0He had no intention of making any relationship in Korea in the first place.\u201cAh, it\u2019s a shame.\u00a0Let me know if you change your mind.\u00a0I will introduce you to a good person.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Thank you.\u201dA smile appeared on Lee Eunyoung\u2019s face as Inseop greeted her politely.\u00a0Having been here a lot on this floor, she knew how top-star managers treated people.\u00a0There were people who mistakenly thought that the entertainer they were playing was them, and there were many people who cringed at the director, but were stiff towards the extra performers.It was hard to find a person with a polite and friendly personality like Choi Inseop.\u201cBut why don\u2019t you eat with Lee Wooyeon?\u00a0Where did he go?\u201dAs Inseop heard Eunyoung\u2019s question, his face turned red, coughing, and pounding his chest with his fist.\u201cDrink water here.\u201dInseop drank the water she poured into the paper cup at once.\u00a0After coughing like that for a while, Inseop answered in a small voice, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cThe manager doesn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cNothing!\u00a0Nothing happened!\u201dLee Eunyoung could guess what had happened from the way he was denying fiercely with a redder face than when he coughed.Isn\u2019t it said that a strong negation is called positivity?\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0Nothing would have happened.\u201dEunyoung thought she would pretend that she didn\u2019t know and move on.\u00a0However, Inseop, who had already remembered something, put his forehead on his lap and fell into a sense of shame.\u201cHuh\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe let out a pleasant sigh at the feel of his soft fur.\u00a0It was Will.\u00a0Every morning Will would jump onto his bed and wake him up like this.\u00a0He reached out and embraced the soft warmth.\u00a0A pleasant shower cologne scent from Will\u2026\u00a0shower cologne?!\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026!\u201dWhen he opened his eyes, he realized that the person he was hugging was dark haired, not the white haired Will, and screamed out.\u00a0Instinctively, he struggled, thinking that he had to run away, and then he rolled over to the bottom of the bed.\u00a0The sheet that came with him obscured his view.Inseop desperately struggled with his hands and removed the sheet.\u00a0What appeared in front of him was a man from the Jeolla province.\u201c\u2026\u00a0what are you doing.\u201dHe asked in a hoarse voice.Inseop couldn\u2019t tell if the situation in front of him was a dream or reality, so he traced his face with his palm to find his cheek.\u00a0As it slammed down, the tingling pain informed him that this was reality.As if he had not yet woken up, the man who looked beautiful even with a slight frown on his face blinked a couple of times and asked again.\u201cWhat are you doing in the morning?\u00a0Are you trying to be funny?\u201d\u201cuh\u2026\u00a0Ah\u2026\u201dThe words disappeared and did not come out of his mouths.\u201cYou fell asleep on the sofa yesterday.\u00a0Dripping blood.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was a shame to sleep like that on the sofa, but when he was informed that he was bleeding, Inseop wanted to evaporate into the air.He could remember closing his eyes, thinking that it was painful and lonely to the point of death\u2026 and he fell asleep like that.\u00a0He really was not really human either.\u201cWell, why am I in bed\u2026\u201d\u201cWell.\u00a0I think you went to the bathroom and came in here.\u00a0I didn\u2019t move you, so you must have come on your own feet.\u201dLee Wooyeon gave a long yawn with a sleepy expression.\u00a0Every time he moved, his bare body, not wearing a single cloth, was revealed.It was ironic that the voice of CEO Kim, who cursed Lee Wooyeon for not skipping exercise no matter how tired he was, and even adjusting his diet, came to mind at that moment.It was a fact that anyone, except the blind, could recognize at a glance that Lee Wooyeon was in good shape.\u00a0Of course, Inseop knew it too.\u00a0In some cases, he had to borrow clothes, so he knew his body size.\u2026But seeing it with his own eyes was different.Inseop was about to die.He was half-naked last time, but now he was fully naked\u2026 He was a mountain across the water. No, he met a tiger while trying to avoid the tiger. No. Did Horangi and Beomirang\u00a0have the same meaning?\u00a0In this case, the proverb fits perfectly\u2026 What use is the proverb now?\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was lying naked in front of him!\u201cYou okay?\u00a0The nosebleeds seem to have stopped.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Ah\u2026 Yes.\u201dInseop fumbled his nose with his hand and pulled out a tissue stained with dried blood.Seeing this, Lee Wooyeon smiled softly and buried his face in the pillow.Choi Inseop\u2019s face was hot.According to his plan, he would be with Lee Wooyeon as if he was not there, and after uncovering his dual nature, he would be dismissed smoothly and he had to slowly disappear to the United States.\u00a0It was not at all pleasing to Inseop to keep getting entangled with Lee Wooyeon in this way.\u00a0In Lee Wooyeon\u2019s memory, he would remain as the manager who fell asleep on the sofa with a nosebleed\u2026 No, there was the lake incident before that, the toilet pervert incident, and not long ago, he even got caught crying while crying on the roof.Now he was looking at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s nude body under the bed\u2026He was screwed. So screwed.In Lee Wooyeon\u2019s memory, he couldn\u2019t help but admit that he was glamorous as a manager with a faint impression.\u00a0A few years later, when he thought of the manager named Choi Inseop, it was clear that two letters of truth would appear in front of him.\u201cWhat time is it?\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s question, Inseop turned his head to look for the watch.\u201cIt\u2019s not even four o\u2019clock yet.\u201d\u201cThen we can sleep a little more.\u00a0I set an alarm.\u201dHe heard Lee Wooyeon lying on the bed again.\u00a0Inseop, who was on the floor, was unable to do anything except fiddle with the sheet.\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you coming?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0No.\u00a0I\u2019ll go back to the sofa\u2026\u00a0Ahh!\u201dA large hand that reached out from the darkness grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm.\u00a0Even in the midst of falling backwards, Inseop hated himself for thinking that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand holding him was huge.\u201cJust sleep.\u00a0We\u2019ll get up soon anyway.\u201d\u201cNo, on the sofa\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon pulled the bed sheet and put it on Inseop.\u00a0Then he grabbed both ends of the sheet and turned to the other side.\u00a0Choi Inseop was trapped inside the seat.Hearing Lee Wooyeon, who was lying next to him, breathing quietly, he waited for the alarm with his eyes wide open.It was the longest hour of his life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s all about making ends meet anyway.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Eat it all and leave it there. I\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s fine.\u00a0I\u2019ll clean it up, so don\u2019t worry and go.\u201dInseop said thank you and busily walked towards the 2nd set.\u00a0All the way, his heart was heavy, wondering how to look at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face.\u00a0All the way to today\u2019s filming location, Inseop didn\u2019t say a word to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He answered only in a short form and didn\u2019t even look at his face.\u00a0In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to say that he ran away from Lee Wooyeon all day today.Normally, he quietly waited for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s call in a place where his eyes could reach him, but today he desperately hid himself.\u00a0When he was filming, he was hiding behind a tree, and when he was resting, he was hiding behind the set.Even the lunch box was purposely found in a corner and eaten alone, but in the end, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s call made his efforts go in vain.\u201cha\u2026\u201dA familiar shadow appeared in front of him as he sighed.\u201cWhat are you worried about?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you thinking of dying like that?\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u00a0I heard you called me\u00a0\u2026\u201dInseop shook his head and fiddled with the hem of his clothes.\u00a0He knew it was immature behavior, but there was no other way.\u00a0Just the fact that he was standing in front of Lee Wooyeon now made his face pale.\u201cThe director said there was something to discuss about the filming schedule.\u00a0When it comes to scheduling issues, he said the manager knows better than me, so he\u2019s looking for Inseop.\u201d\u201cAre you the director?\u201dChoi Inseop rolled his eyes and raised his head.\u201cOf course, you should discuss it with me first and then talk with the director.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dSeeing the manager who lost his vitality in his eyes and lowered his head at that one word, Lee Wooyeon grabbed his neck and wanted to tell him to do something properly to deceive people.Still, it was still fun to see his expression change back and forth with each word he said.\u201cWhat time is it on Wednesday?\u201d\u201cYou have an interview scheduled in the morning, so it will probably be possible at 3pm.\u201d\u201cWhat about Friday?\u00a0Can you make time in the morning?\u201d\u201cIt is impossible.\u00a0If it\u2019s a Saturday morning, you\u2019ll be fine.\u00a0Wait a minute, check\u2026\u201dInseop pulled out a notebook from his pocket.\u201cYes.\u00a0Also on Saturday morning\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cWow, you\u2019re writing very meticulously.\u201dLee Wooyeon pulled his head out and looked at Inseop\u2019s notebook.\u00a0Surprised Choi Inseop tried to close the notebook, but Lee Wooyeon was faster.\u00a0Inseop, who had the notebook taken away, rushed in panic.\u201cGive it back!\u201d\u201cIs there anything written here that I am not allowed to see?\u201dLee Wooyeon held the notebook over his head and pretended to open it.\u00a0Inseop hurriedly stretched out his hand.\u00a0As it was like a diary in which he wrote not only information about Lee Wooyeon, but also his feelings, he desperately reached out.\u201cGive it back!\u00a0Don\u2019t look!\u00a0You can\u2019t see it.\u201dPeople passing by burst into laughter when they saw Inseop screaming while running around Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Inseop wanted to cry.\u00a0It may seem like a joke to others, but to him it was a desperate problem.On the very first page of the notebook, there was also a picture of Jennie and himself.\u00a0When he ran out of pages in his notebook, he would always put the picture in a new one.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want Lee Wooyeon to find out about anything.\u201cGive it back!\u00a0Please!\u201dAt first, it was a joke, but when Inseop became so scared and shouted, Lee Wooyeon had no intention of returning the notebook.\u201cAre you cursing me by writing here?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon opened the notebook, Inseop ran with all his might and stretched out his hand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who has a motor nerve incomparable to that of a normal person, turned slightly to avoid Inseop\u2019s hand.\u00a0Thanks to this, Inseop fell to the floor with his body stretched out like a frog who had been electrocuted.People burst into laughter at the sight of him falling over with a clap and pounding noise.\u201cHahaha.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, why are you so mean?\u201d\u201cYou are more playful than you look.\u201dLee Wooyeon also smiled cheerfully and wore a playful top star mask.\u201cIt\u2019s because the manager is cute.\u00a0It makes me want to play pranks without realizing it.\u201dHe squatted down next to Inseop, who was lying on the floor.\u201cI\u2019ll give it back.\u00a0Stand up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you getting up?\u00a0Then can I have this?\u201dChoi Inseop raised his head.\u00a0Looking down at how he had his mouth closed while holding back tears, Lee Wooyeon smiled softly.So wasn\u2019t it him who wanted to play hide-and-seek all day?\u00a0It was very annoying to find him.\u00a0Even today, he didn\u2019t know how many of the staff members he asked to find Inseop.Lee Wooyeon shook Inseop\u2019s shoulder as if playing a prank on his close friend.\u201cGet up.\u201dLee Wooyeon raised Inseop and stood him up.\u00a0As soon as Inseop got up from the floor, he reached out again to retrieve the notebook.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand as if he knew it would happen.\u00a0Then he wiggled it playfully.\u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d\u201cThere is no\u2026\u00a0Please return it.\u201dIt was fun to see him pretend to be calm with tears flowing.People who passed by said, \u201cPlease stop. Return it now,\u201d and started to take Inseop\u2019s side.\u00a0The joke should have ended here.\u00a0At this point, he knew he had to give it back, but Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t feel like it.It was difficult.\u00a0He should stop joking around at this point, but it was difficult because it was getting more and more fun.Lee Wooyeon smiled and looked at Inseop\u2019s face.\u00a0He started to look forward to how much more trouble he would make.Choi Inseop bit his lip.\u00a0Waiting for Lee Wooyeon to return the notebook, it seemed that all the contents in it would be found out.The thought that Lee Wooyeon might know something about him right here, right now, made him more and more afraid.\u00a0He was cowardly, but he did not have the confidence to receive the contemptuous gaze from Lee Wooyeon.Lee Wooyeon stopped laughing when his big eyes, dyed with fear, glared at him.Again.\u00a0A mass of heavy and hot emotions ran up from the stomach to the inside of the throat.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dInseop flew towards Lee Wooyeon as much as he could.\u00a0It was either death or slaughter.\u201cAh\u2013!\u201dIt was an unexpected counterattack.Suddenly, Lee Wooyeon, who did not think that the gentle manager would throw himself at him, lost his balance and fell backwards.\u00a0The two of them fell to the floor with their bodies overlapping.Lee Wooyeon instinctively hugged Inseop\u2019s shoulder with one hand.\u00a0Heis slender shoulders were cradled in his arms.\u00a0A sweet sensation was transmitted through Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand.Choi Inseop did not miss a chance and quickly took the notebook.\u201cI will take it back.\u201dInseop wiped the dust off the notebook and put it in his pocket.\u00a0He also felt elated.\u00a0It seemed like he gave Lee Wooyeon a nice shot.In fact, Lee Wooyeon was looking up at him with a puzzled expression.\u00a0Inseop reached out his hand to lift him up.\u201cGet up.\u201dIt felt good.\u00a0For the first time in Korea, he felt like he was standing above Lee Wooyeon.\u201cUh, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand\u2015\u2015.\u201dBut that feeling of superiority did not last for even three seconds.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face also became contemplative from a single word from the coordinator standing next to him in contemplation.The bottom of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s palm, which was on the floor, was stained red with blood.\u201cAh, I must have been hurt.\u201dLee Wooyeon waved his hand as if it was nothing.\u00a0Blood splattered over his clothes.\u00a0It looked like his hand was torn when he fell backwards.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t cut deep enough to see his bones, but the wound was pretty deep, so there was quite a bit of blood.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and said to Inseop.\u00a0However, those words had not reached Inseop\u2019s ears.\u00a0As if his own hand had been cut off, he had turned pale and stared blankly at the blood flowing from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand.The FD rushed over and looked at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand and frowned.\u00a0Blood was constantly gushing out of the bumpy torn wounds.\u201cCan you move?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLee Wooyeon moved his fingers one by one.\u00a0Blood dripped down his fingers and wet the tips of his sleeves.\u00a0Another FD showed up with a medicine box.\u00a0While disinfecting his hands and applying medicine, Lee Wooyeon did not frown once.\u201cOh, it must be very painful.\u00a0Are you really okay?\u201dThe FD wrapped around the bandages asked with a worried face.\u201cYes.\u00a0Well, that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there a jousting scene today?\u201dInstead of answering, Lee Wooyeon looked at Inseop\u2019s face, who was standing still.\u00a0It was as expected.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s complexion turned pale as if he was about to collapse.\u00a0As if his own finger had been cut off.Inseop stood there with his mouth shut until the wounds were all tied up with bandages.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThese were the first words Inseop, who was standing in gloomy silence, opened his mouth.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI am\u2026\u00a0because of me.\u201dEven speaking up to this point was too strong, Inseop swallowed dry saliva and spoke again.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry that you fell and your hand was hurt like that.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dLee Wooyeon looked at the bandaged palm and replied cheerfully.\u201cI will accept any kind of punishment as a result of this incident.\u201dChoi Inseop seemed to think he would definitely get fired from his job.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon felt a little dirty.\u00a0When he thought that Choi Inseop was not worried about his injured hand, but whether he was going to be fired or not, a burning displeasure rose from his stomach and up his throat.\u201cPunishment?\u00a0Why are you saying that?\u00a0I don\u2019t get it.\u201dLee Wooyeon continued to speak with a sulky impression.\u201cAm I going to tell you that I\u2019m firing the manager for something like this?\u00a0\u2026Ah\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon, who was about to put his hand in her pocket, groaned in pain, Inseop was restless and looked at his face.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Would you like to go to the hospital right now?\u00a0May I contact the representative?\u00a0Are you very sick?\u201dSeeing the other person cut off from his own pain, Lee Wooyeon felt a strange sense of satisfaction.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt much.\u00a0I have to be patient.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I was very playful.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I\u2019m glad Inseop wasn\u2019t hurt.\u201dEveryone could not help but be moved by the appearance of actor Lee Wooyeon who smiled generously and spoke like that.\u00a0They were the ones who had seen a lot of celebrities in the field screaming at the manager\u2019s small mistakes.Lee Wooyeon was like a miracle to those who worked hard in the field.\u00a0Inseop, who caused such pain to such a person, was still restless.\u00a0The director, who heard the news not long after, rushed to the site.\u201cWhat?\u00a0What happened?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u00a0Director.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not not big deal.\u00a0With your hands like that, can you shoot today?\u00a0How did this happen?\u201dWhen the director raised his voice and asked, Inseop\u2019s shoulder shook.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon stopped him from going forward.\u201cI fell alone.\u201d\u201cYou should have been careful.\u00a0Can you ride a horse right now?\u00a0No, riding a horse is not the problem.\u201dThe scene that required the most attention in the historical drama was riding a horse.\u00a0This was because a fall accident can lead to serious injuries.\u00a0When preparing for a historical drama, the first thing male actors did was learn to ride a horse.\u00a0Otherwise, it would have been better to use a double from the beginning.\u00a0There were quite a few cases where they said they would ride a horse, but it led to an accident.Above all, Lee Wooyeon decided to play the scene in which he stumbled into a trap while riding a horse and fell without a stand-in.\u201cI\u2019ll have to tell the action director to prepare for the role.\u201d\u201cHow do I use a stand-in?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulders were unusually wider than other male actors, so it was obvious that if he used a double, he would get noticed at once.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big scene, but if you\u2019ve already used it, the viewers won\u2019t be able to get immersed in it.\u00a0Clearly.\u201d\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know that?\u00a0But today, you have to shoot a scene where you roll off a horse, but how are you going to do it with your hands like that?\u201dLee Wooyeon glanced at Inseop who was standing next to him.\u00a0His expression was getting worse and worse, like a person being strangled.\u00a0It looked like he was going to fall over if he left it like that.\u00a0That was not the problem here.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u00a0Director.\u201d\u201cThen what if you get hurt?\u00a0Use a stand-in today.\u00a0Are you going to be filming only today?\u201dEven if no one else knew, if Lee Wooyeon was injured, the whole filming would be disrupted.\u00a0In a situation that was not long before the airing, that was something that shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201cIt\u2019s not just for today, so you shouldn\u2019t use a stand-in.\u201d\u201cHa, you really.\u201dThe director grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand and looked around.\u201cAre you really okay?\u00a0If you think it will be too much, postpone the filming.\u201dProcrastinating the filming date was a disaster not only for the staff but also for the actors.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit painful, but it doesn\u2019t interfere with movement.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m glad.\u201dWhen the director made a very suspicious expression, Lee Wooyeon smiled softly as if he was really okay.\u00a0When the director left to prepare for filming, Inseop bowed his head again and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYou told me that earlier. It\u2019s okay. Oh, can you get me dressed?\u201dChoi Inseop quickly took Lee Wooyeon\u2019s jumper and held the end of the sleeve so that he could wear it.\u00a0As the wound rubbed against his clothes, he purposely frowned slightly.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who saw this, was startled and asked if he was okay with it.\u201cI think I was punished for making fun of my good manager.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019m just\u2026\u201dInseop\u2019s ears were dead.\u00a0The tail and ears that weren\u2019t there could be seen hanging down.Lee Wooyeon was happy to see Inseop, who was so depressed because of him.\u00a0Suddenly, as long as it didn\u2019t interfere with his work, he thought that it would be okay to get hurt often.He shouldn\u2019t have such a useless habit.\u201cWhat.\u00a0Why are your hands like that again?\u201dKang Youngmo, who was passing by, found Lee Wooyeon and shouted.\u201cI fell.\u201dLee Wooyeon spoke up before Choi Inseop stepped forward.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0There is a horse riding scene today.\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern.\u00a0It\u2019s no problem.\u201d\u201cReally?\u00a0Be careful not to fall off the horse.\u00a0Then, if one part breaks, an unprecedented situation of replacing the lead actor can occur.\u201d\u201cWe will make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then good luck.\u201dAs Kang Youngmo passed by, Choi Inseop widened his eyes as if in surprise.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s surprising.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt seems that Kang Youngmo is very worried about you.\u00a0I was a little surprised.\u201dLooking at Kang Youngmo\u2019s back, Inseop\u2019s muttering expression showed the surprise of the other person.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon noticed that his manager was genuinely surprised, and not being sarcastic.\u201cDoes it sound like he was really worried?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he just say you were worried?\u00a0Did I hear it wrong?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled brightly.\u00a0He quietly tapped the manager\u2019s shoulder.\u201cYou heard him right.\u201dInseop tilted his head slightly and waited for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s next words, as if he could not understand the situation.\u201cHow about you manager?\u00a0Are you worried about me?\u201dLee Wooyeon raised his hand wrapped in bandages and asked.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s big eyes filled with guilt and conflict.He injured him by knocking him over and he had to shoot an important scene today.\u00a0He shouldn\u2019t be worried.But did he deserve it?\u00a0Can he say that he was worried about him, he was very worried and felt guilty for hurting him.No matter what kindness he gave, the end was the same.\u00a0He must betray Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Even knowing that, he kept feeling guilty.\u201cYes.\u00a0I am worried.\u201dChoi Inseop was deliberately blunt.\u00a0So that his feelings of excessive concern for Lee Wooyeon were not revealed.\u201cOkay, do that.\u201dA gentle voice like the spring breeze echoed above his head.\u00a0Inseop raised his head halfway at the words he couldn\u2019t understand.\u00a0He didn\u2019t have the courage to look into his eyes.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips moved gracefully.\u201cPlease continue to worry.\u00a0Then\u2026\u201dWhile Inseop was looking for a word to answer, Lee Wooyeon disappeared among the staff.Inseop stared blankly at his familiar back.\u201cDid you hear that?\u201dJenny, who opened the door without knocking, exclaimed in an excited voice.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dClosing the notebook he was writing, Peter turned his head.\u201cPrince!\u00a0Philip!\u00a0I\u2019m talking about the prince.\u201dWhen the name Philip came up, Peter\u2019s heart fluttered.\u00a0He still hadn\u2019t told Jenny that he had seen the prince at the Korean youth group.The first day he met him, he thought of the poems of poet Kim Namjo the whole time under his blanket.\u00a0Peter forgot to tell Jenny about the prince, thinking about the poem with every word stuck in his body like a fever.\u00a0As the two days passed, then three or four days passed, it became more and more difficult to talk.\u00a0He thought he had to do it, but it didn\u2019t come off his mouth easily.\u201cI happened to hear some girls today and they said that the prince was of Korean descent.\u00a0He is of Korean descent like you.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u00a0okay\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that surprising?\u00a0The fact that he shares the same blood as you.\u201d\u201cWell.\u00a0I never thought that I was Korean.\u201dIt was an inconvenient truth, but that was the truth.He didn\u2019t even know the face of his birth mother, and since he left Korea when he was a baby, he has no memory of that country.\u00a0For him, it was no exaggeration to say that the image of Korea as a country was all that his father gave him.\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s a good opportunity.\u00a0It\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201dHer eyes gleamed.\u00a0Her cheeks were rosy.\u201cWhat chance?\u201d\u201cDo you speak Korean?\u201d\u201cUh?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Huh.\u00a0Why?\u201d\u201cTeach me Korean.\u00a0Until graduation, I will continue to write love letters to the prince in Korean.\u00a0He\u2019ll wonder who it is.\u00a0Then I\u2019ll appear and speak to the prince in Korean.\u00a0Be my partner.\u00a0How romantic!\u201dShe clasped her hands and spread her imagination.\u00a0She seemed to think that talking to Philip, who was of Korean descent, in Korean would have a great effect.\u00a0Peter wanted to advise her to stop.Whenever Philip came to the Korean youth group, the girls around him deliberately spoke in Korean.\u00a0It was an obvious intention to feel a sense of unity.\u00a0Philip was kind to all the women, as Jenny said.\u00a0But it didn\u2019t make anyone special.\u201cKorean?\u00a0Me?\u00a0To you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Are you fine with it?\u00a0Is that a good idea?\u201d\u201cJennie\u2026can you learn?\u201dPeter knew almost everything about Jenny.\u00a0She had no hobbies and no talent for studies.\u00a0Especially when it came to the linguistics part.\u201cOf course.\u00a0I can do it.\u00a0Let\u2019s do it from today.\u00a0Right now.\u201dJenny\u2019s enthusiasm seemed to skyrocket at the thought of being able to become a special being to the prince.\u00a0Jenny sat at Peter\u2019s desk and urged him to start studying quickly.\u00a0However, she could not even get past the first page of the first step of Hangul, which Peter brought through the bookshelf, and she fell on his desk.\u201cI think I\u2019m going to die\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the first time, so what?\u00a0You don\u2019t have to memorize all the consonants and vowels.\u201dPeter shook Jenny\u2019s shoulder and spoke playfully.\u201cI have no idea what it is.\u00a0Why are the letters so weird?\u00a0It looks like a painting.\u201d\u201cDid you think learning a foreign language was easy?\u00a0First, go home today and memorize all the consonants and vowels.\u00a0Understand?\u201dPeter carefully wrote in the exercise book.\u00a0Jenny, who was looking at him silently, burst into laughter.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d\u201cThat letter looks interesting.\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d\u201cThis.\u201dShe pointed her finger at the consonant \u2018\u314e\u2019.\u201cWhy is this interesting?\u201d\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s wearing a hat.\u00a0Cute.\u00a0They look like flowers.\u201dPeter had never thought of it that way, but when he listened to her, the words really looked like a person wearing a hat.\u201cAre you going to fill out the letter to the prince with only those letters?\u00a0To let him know that my heart is a flower garden.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0He\u2019ll probably think it was a letter from a crazy stalker.\u00a0Besides, if you use it repeatedly, it will make it seem like you\u2019re laughing.\u201dPeter mimicked the sound of laughter and laughed for a while.\u00a0Jenny laughed along with him.\u00a0Peter\u2019s mother entered the room as the sound of their laughter flowed out the stairs.\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny that you laugh like that?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing.\u201dPeter waved his hand.\u00a0There was still a playful smile on his face.\u201cJenny, would you like to stay for dinner?\u00a0Today, Peter\u2019s uncle has decided to come, so we\u2019re making dinner in Korean style.\u00a0I don\u2019t know if it will suit your taste, but would you like to try it?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I have to go home.\u00a0My mother is cooking dinner for me and waiting.\u201dPeter and his mother knew it was a lie, but he said nothing.\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u00a0Let\u2019s eat together next time.\u201cYes.\u00a0Thank you.\u201dJenny smiled cheerfully and got up from her seat.\u201cPeter, see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Do your homework by tomorrow.\u201dPeter handed her the practice sheet.\u00a0Jenny put her hand on her forehead as if she was tired.\u00a0Seeing her off, Peter helped his mother prepare dinner.It was the next day that Jenny\u2019s depression started again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Love History Caused by Willful NegligenceCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPeter was woken up by a familiar noise.\u00a0He opened his eyes and looked around and saw that something small was hitting the window.\u00a0Peter staggered over and opened the window.\u201cJennie\u2026\u00a0?\u201dAs expected, Jenny was standing below.\u00a0Peter was completely awakened by the surprise.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t that he woke himself up at this time, but that her appearance had no choice but to surprise him.\u201cWait there.\u00a0I will come.\u201dPeter draped a jumper over his pajamas and left the room with a cardigan in one hand.\u00a0As he went down the stairs, he raised his heels so that his parents wouldn\u2019t wake up.When he got out and looked closer, Jenny\u2019s appearance was even more spectacular.\u00a0Her hair was all tangled up, her lips ripped open and bloody, and her eyes had black bruises.It broke Peter\u2019s heart to see her appearing like this after a few days.\u201c\u2026Did you fight?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe didn\u2019t ask who she fought with.\u00a0It was unconventional.Peter put the cardigan he had brought over Jenny\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0It felt a little small to cover her heavy body, but Peter\u2019s warmt melted her frozen heart.\u201cWould you like to go to my room?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\u201cDinner?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPeter took her hand without saying a word.\u00a0He sat her down on a bench in the backyard, said he\u2019d be back soon, and went into the house.\u00a0Minutes later, he came out again, and in his hand was bread with peanut butter and jam.\u201cEat.\u201dPeter put the bread in Jenny\u2019s hand.\u201cI\u2019m on a diet\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u00a0Then should I eat it?\u201dAs Peter pretended to take the bread again, Jenny hurriedly grabbed the bread.\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u00a0I\u2019ll eat it because of your sincerity.\u00a0Why don\u2019t I go on a diet starting tomorrow?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Great.\u201dPeter sat down next to her.\u00a0Jenny hastily began to eat the bread like a man possessed.\u00a0Peter smiled and waited for her to finish the bread before handing her the orange juice.Jenny\u2019s complexion returned after she emptied a bottle of orange juice.\u201cSorry for waking you up\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cI just wanted to talk to someone.\u00a0Otherwise, I thought I would die.\u201d\u201cWhat did you want to talk about so much?\u201dJenny laughed a little.\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201dHer voice saying that was so pitiful.\u00a0Peter wanted to calm her mood, so he thought of a pleasant topic.\u201cDid you finish the homework I gave you?\u201d\u201cAhaha.\u00a0I forgot.\u201d\u201cThen what will you do?\u00a0Aren\u2019t you going to write a letter to the prince?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you just write the script for me?\u201d\u201cGhost writing?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll write a letter, you can translate it into Korean. Okay?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of love letter is that? Who writes love letters for you?\u201d\u201cAh, what are you saying?\u00a0You are only translating.\u201dWiping her jam-stained lips, she smiled naturally.\u00a0Peter\u2019s heart ached when he saw her ripped lips.\u00a0So to such a ridiculous request, he said yes and agreed.\u201cReally?\u00a0Really?\u00a0Wow, that\u2019s exciting.\u201dJenny laughed like a child.Yes, Jenny just had to laugh.Peter nodded.At the time, he didn\u2019t know what it would mean.Weekend Korean Association gatherings were getting more and more crowded.\u00a0As the rumors about Philip spread, people who had not been seen for a while started coming to the gathering again.\u00a0In particular, the participation of women was noticeably higher.\u00a0Even women who were not of the youth group participated in the meeting.Even if he was a little late, there was no place to sit, so he had to stand and listen to the class.\u00a0Peter left the house early to get a seat today.He looked at the watch on his wrist. His mother\u2019s errand took longer than expected.\u00a0He was nervous.\u00a0To get a window seat, he had to enter the auditorium at least 30 minutes before class time.Philip always sat by the window.\u00a0His seat was regarded as a reserved seat, and no one sat there.Peter sat a couple of rows behind Philip.\u00a0It was nice to see his back from behind.\u00a0It was a shallow thought that it wouldn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t tell Jenny if it was just his back.\u201cI\u2019m late.\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t run.\u00a0He hastened his steps and turned around the corner.\u00a0Peter collided head-on with someone walking from the other side and fell to the floor.\u00a0The book he was holding was scattered on the floor.As if muttering, Peter apologized, and quickly began to pick up the book.\u00a0The person he bumped into also bent down and started to help Peter.\u201cThank you\u2026\u201dPeter couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut.\u00a0Philip, no, it was Lee Wooyeon.Dressed in a white T-shirt and dark jeans, he asked Peter.\u201cAren\u2019t you hurt?\u201dIt was a friendly voice.\u00a0He never imagined that the day would come when that voice was directed towards him.\u00a0So Peter stood there staring at him for a long time.\u201cAre you injured somewhere?\u201dWhen he asked the question as if confirming, Peter barely nodded.\u201cIs this book interesting?\u201dHe looked at the title of the book in his hand and asked.\u00a0It was Kim Seungok\u2019s endless journey, which he received as a gift from his uncle.\u00a0Peter couldn\u2019t answer because he had not read more than a dozen pages yet.\u201cIf you read it and enjoy it, lend it to me later.\u201dHaving said that, Philip handed the book to Peter.\u00a0All of a sudden, the girls who found Philip surrounded him.\u00a0Peter grabbed the book he had given him and watched Philip\u2019s back as he walked away.Peter sat down on a bench without going to class and read the book on the spot.\u00a0The novel was interesting.\u00a0To the extent that he looked up at the sky for a while and pondered the sentence.When class was over, Philip came out, but there were walls of girls around him that were thicker than before.\u00a0Peter watched Phillip\u2019s back as he moved away from the bench.\u00a0The opportunity to speak to\u00a0 Lee Wooyeon first did not come again.Eventually he put the book back into his bag.\u201cIs Lee Wooyeon hurt?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cHe wasn\u2019t hurt because of you, and you have nothing to be sorry about.\u201d\u201cI hurt him.\u00a0I pushed Lee Wooyeon and he fell and got hurt.\u201dThe report was confusing.\u00a0There was silence over the phone.\u00a0Inseop thought that swear words or shouts would come, so he gripped the phone tightly.\u201c\u2026\u00a0are you okay?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0You pushed Lee Wooyeon, did anything happen?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t understand what CEO Kim was saying, so Inseop asked back what he meant.\u201cDidn\u2019t Lee Wooyeon say anything?\u00a0No, no.\u00a0you come back now\u00a0Don\u2019t be alone with Lee Wooyeon.\u201dInseop looked at the screen of his cell phone and confirmed that the person he was talking to was CEO Kim Hakseung.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u00a0It was not me who was injured, but Mr. Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0CEO.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what!\u00a0How terrifying Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body is!\u00a0No matter how tired he is, he exercises, eats healthy food, drinks alcohol and smokes moderately, and does nothing more than relieve stress, and besides\u2026\u00a0 Ack.\u201dCEO Kim\u2019s voice faded away from the phone.\u00a0Choi Inseop shouted, \u201cHello, hello.\u201d\u00a0He heard a voice from the manager Cha harassing CEO Kim, and soon after that,\u00a0 manager Cha picked up the phone, and he continued the call.\u201cOh, Mr. Inseop.\u00a0It\u2019s Manager Cha.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Manager.\u201d\u201cIs Inseop not hurt?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I am okay.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon loves his body like a diamond, okay?\u00a0So today he can be particularly sharp.\u00a0Do you know what I mean?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I understand.\u201dWhen he heard that he might be particularly sharp today, Inseop tilted his head for a moment.Although his hand was hurt, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t look particularly bad.\u00a0Even considering that he was an actor with great emotional control, there was no sign of that.\u00a0As for Lee Wooyeon, Inseop, who gathered enough information to be called a stalker, was able to boldly conclude that his mood was not bad.No, he even seemed a little excited.\u00a0Inseop thought that his excitement was due to the horseback shoot in the afternoon.\u201cAnd after today\u2019s filming is over, after taking Lee Wooyeon home, go straight home.\u00a0If he ask you out for a drink or something, then say it\u2019s okay because you\u2019re tired.\u201d\u201cOf course I can\u2019t drink because he has a shoot tomorrow.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s sort of, Inseop\u2026 Anyway, take care of yourself.\u00a0If anything happens, call me immediately.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Okay.\u201dManager Cha told him to be careful a few more times and then hung up.\u00a0Inseop put his cell phone in his pocket and felt uncomfortable.\u201cMr. Inseop!\u201dIn the distance, Lee Eunyoung waved her hand and walked towards Inseop.\u00a0She was wearing plain clothes as she finished all of today\u2019s filming.\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0It\u2019s all over for today.\u00a0When are you leaving?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go.\u00a0I\u2019ll probably be able to go after midnight.\u201d\u201cYou must be tired.\u00a0You should sleep in the car and wait.\u201d\u201cNo. Lee\u00a0Wooyeon is injured and I have to help him.\u201d\u201cLee Wooyeon?\u00a0Where is he hurt?\u201d\u201cHand\u2026 because of me.\u00a0He got hurt because I pushed him.\u201dHis face was hot as he spoke.\u00a0It was embarrassing to be a manager and to have hurt the actor he was managing.\u201cDid Lee Wooyeon fall?\u00a0Oh, I can\u2019t even imagine.\u00a0Wooyeon is rumored to have good athleticism.\u00a0They say that he exercises daily.\u00a0Did he fall backwards after you pushed him?\u00a0With that body?\u201d\u201cHey, I\u2019m strong too.\u201dChoi Inseop protested in a weak voice.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0You\u2019ll be strong.\u00a0Of course.\u00a0But I wonder if Lee Wooyeon is someone who will fall if pushed.\u00a0He must have been very careless at the time.\u201dWas Lee Wooyeon someone with a careless personality?Inseop tried to recall Lee Wooyeon\u2019s expression just before he hit him with his body, but to no avail.\u00a0He did not have time to look for fear that his identity could be revealed if he saw the contents of the notebook.He was lucky.\u00a0He could only explain it like that.\u00a0Of course, the results were terribly bad.\u201cBy the way, didn\u2019t you say he was filming a horse riding scene today?\u00a0I think I have seen a trailer with horses before.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dAs Inseop;s expression suddenly darkened, Eunyoung thought that she had made a mistake in her words, and reached out to him with a bright voice.\u201cAh. It\u2019s okay.\u00a0These days, whenever possible, the action team will do it for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 He said he won\u2019t use a body double.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0but.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon is a bit like that.\u201dEither way, Inseop\u2019s expression didn\u2019t seem to brighten.\u00a0\u201cOh,\u201d she said and slapped her knee.\u201cOkay.\u00a0Go and ask the horse.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0What do you mean?\u201d\u201cLee Wooyeon has a horse to ride.\u00a0Go and ask the horse to finish filming safely today.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Can I ask?\u201dThere was no way the animals would listen to him if he asked for such a request, but it was brought up in the hope that it would be of some comfort to Inseop, who looked depressed.\u201cSure.\u00a0They\u2019re trained kids, so they\u2019re amazingly good at doing what people ask.\u00a0They even understand the words ready-go, cut.\u00a0So, go ahead and ask them to make sure we can shoot safely today.\u201dInseop\u2019s expression brightened at once.\u201cWhere shall I go?\u201d\u201cUhm, maybe, they usually put it in the back of set 5.\u00a0There is a building that has been set up like a stable there.\u201dFor her, who had only been an assistant performer for five years, the scenery on the set was like a picture on the palm of her hand.\u201cCan I go over there?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Go over there and when you come out to the pond, turn left and go straight.\u00a0If you don\u2019t know, call the staff and ask and they will tell you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cAh, this is nothing.\u00a0Thanks to Inseop, I ate a delicious lunch today.\u00a0If you don\u2019t know, should I go with you?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u00a0I will go alone.\u00a0After a while, I have to go help Wooyeon change his clothes.\u201d\u201cOkay, then.\u00a0I\u2019ll go ahead.\u00a0See you next time.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0See you next time.\u201dChoi Inseop greeted Eunyoung and diligently moved toward the direction she had given.\u00a0As she said, as he turned left along the pond, he saw a trailer with horses parked there.He thought it must be around here, so when he asked a passing staff member, he pointed to a shabby looking temporary building in the corner.As he got closer, he could smell the animals.\u00a0As he opened the door to enter the building, someone hurriedly ran out of it.\u201cuh\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dTheir shoulders bumped into each other.\u00a0Choi Inseop recognized that he was Kang Youngmo\u2019s manager and bowed his head.\u00a0However, Kang Youngmo\u2019s manager turned his head with an angry expression and hurriedly left the place.\u00a0Inseop scratched his head in embarrassment.\u00a0He felt bitter at this situation where even Kang Youngmo\u2019s manager ignored him.It seemed to be true that if celebrities didn\u2019t get along well, the people below them also did not get on with each other.\u00a0He had no intention of making friends with the people in the field, but it was painful to have such a bad relationship.Inseop took a deep breath and entered the building where the horses brought for filming were tied up.\u00a0Inside the building, it was so dark that he could barely see the front.\u00a0There were no voices.\u00a0There seemed to be no one around.Inseop walked slowly and told the tied horses to take good care of them.\u00a0He stopped in front of the horse that was the biggest and most powerful of them.\u00a0Seeing the name tag on the front of the dark gray-haired horse, Inseop widened his eyes.\u201cJenny?\u201dThe horse pricked up his ears when he heard his name and turned to look at him.\u00a0Considering the physical condition of Lee Wooyeon, who was the tallest and had the best physique among the cast, this dark gray horse was most likely his.His heart trembled at the strange coincidence.\u00a0In the East, this was called karma.Approaching the gray-haired horse, Inseop calmly spoke to him.\u201cHey.\u00a0Jenny\u2026\u00a0Please.\u201dHe rubbed the horse\u2019s mane with his hand.\u00a0When he met the eyes of the gentle-looking horse, he felt as if he had read his thoughts, the thoughts which he could not tell anyone.\u201cMe too\u2026\u00a0 a useless and pathetic human being.\u201dIn fact, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t know that asking an animal wouldn\u2019t change the situation.\u00a0Now he just wanted to do something.\u00a0The warmth in his hand felt good, and Inseop did not stop stroking the horse.The horse rumbled, and snorted.\u00a0He could see the horse\u2019s breath scattering white in the dark air.It had been a long time since he had had this kind of contact with a living creature.\u00a0The horse shook its head up and down with a continuous sound, and he wondered if it felt good to just touch the fur with her hand.As soon as he showed a certain reaction when touched, Inseop\u2019s mood gradually improved.\u00a0It felt quite different from Kate, who only shrugged off leaves when he touched her with his fingertips.\u201cYes, yes.\u00a0You are so warm and cute.\u201dAfter speaking, Inseop raised his hand as he thought he was a pervert.\u00a0Then the dark gray horse moved its head and placed it under Inseop\u2019s hand.\u201cYou want me to touch you again?\u201dThe horse snorted as if he was responding.\u00a0Inseop smiled and waved his hand.\u00a0He liked the movement and warmth he could feel from living things.He didn\u2019t have many friends, but he grew up with a lot of love in a large family.A lively buzzing sound at every dinner.\u00a0Will\u2019s lovely movement felt at his feet.\u00a0A mother\u2019s goodnight kiss, which was passed along with a good night greeting.\u00a0The whispers of his brothers.\u00a0Those things were good.\u00a0He miss it terribly\u201cShould I raise a horse?\u201dChoi Inseop remembered the scene with a horse standing in the corner of the roof and smiled to himself without enthusiasm.\u00a0Anything was fine.\u00a0It was a feeling of wanting to lean on anything that could alleviate the despair and loneliness he felt right now.\u201cDon\u2019t.\u00a0I shouldn\u2019t\u00a0hahaha,. That\u2019s pretty funny\u00a0Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201dInseop said to himself and laughed for a long time.\u00a0The dark gray horse was blustering and drooling as if it had understood his clumsy gag.\u201cJenny, there you are.\u00a0I\u2019m not really a good person, no, I\u2019m a very bad person.\u201dHe lamented over and over again.\u201cBut I like being kind to people, and I want to be friends with kind people.\u00a0And to Lee Wooyeon\u00a0\u2026\u201dThe end of the speech was blurred.\u00a0Inseop looked around.\u00a0Confirming that no one was there, he continued.\u201cI want to be acknowledged by that person as well.\u00a0As a good manager.\u00a0A manager who was quite good.\u00a0After I leave, when he thinks of me, I want him to think, oh, he wasn\u2019t bad.\u00a0Well, it\u2019s absurd even when I think about it.\u00a0What does that matter?\u00a0No matter how he remembers me\u2026\u00a0He won\u2019t even remember me in the first place.\u00a0Just like how he doesn\u2019 remember Peter from America.\u201dAs soon as the name \u201cPeter,\u201d came out of his mouth, his heart sank.\u00a0He felt like he swallowed a potion that had a strange taste, mixing the memories of that time and the present self.\u201cI wish Lee Wooyeon was a little more mean to me.\u201dEven if it was in front of another person, his palm was torn, but he did not frown at Inseop.\u00a0Throughout the filming, he asked Inseop if he was okay.\u00a0Yesterday, he had a nosebleed and collapsed, so he said he was worried, and even smiled kindly.He had to admit that he was starting to look at him with the same eyes as Peter at that time.\u201cHey.\u00a0Lee Woo-yeon\u2026\u00a0 maybe he\u2019s not a bad person.\u00a0Then just\u2014.\u201dHaving said that, Choi Inseop covered his mouth with his palm.\u00a0He wanted to keep the words he had just mumbled in the dark inside.How much did he beat his heart and cry as he read Jenny\u2019s letter?\u00a0How regretful that he should have believed Jenny as much as he did.\u00a0Out of unbearable guilt, he did not dare to even visit Jenny\u2019s grave, and he cried in front of her for days and days.After everything, he wanted Lee Wooyeon to be a good person now.\u201cHaha\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m going crazy.\u201dInseop pressed his forehead with his palm and closed his eyes.He said that he hoped that the only thing he had to go through all the hardships and go to Korea to check was the fact that Jenny had lied to him again.Irreparable.\u00a0Garbage.\u00a0A sick bastard.\u00a0Dummy.\u00a0Crazy bastard.He poured on him the bad words he knew.\u00a0Still, the feeling of guilt that filled his chest didn\u2019t go away.As Inseop hardened his face, the dark gray horse made a sound with his mouth and put his chin on his shoulder.\u00a0Then he shook his head and tapped Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0With a short movement, Inseop could read exactly what it wanted from him.\u201cStrength\u2026\u00a0Mine?\u201dIt purred.\u00a0And saliva spouted from the moving horse\u2019s mouth.\u00a0Even that was comforting to Choi Inseop.\u00a0He reached out and hugged the horse\u2019s neck.\u2018Jenny, I\u2019m sorry, Jenny, I\u2019ll never doubt you again.\u2019Inseop stood like that for a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if it\u2019s not something that other people see. What you\u2019re writing now is different, right?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if it\u2019s really okay after I see it.\u00a0Instead, if it\u2019s strange, I\u2019ll just quietly leave the note in your mailbox and go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dJenny was right.If it was a novel or a poem, it was written to be shown to others.\u00a0If he ends up jotting down notes alone, he won\u2019t make any progress.\u201cIf it\u2019s weird, you\u2019ll just put it in the mailbox?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0Of course.\u201dPeter meekly handed the note to her.\u00a0After taking the notebook, Jenny said with her eyes shining.\u201cI have something to show you too.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI, I, wrote a letter.\u201d\u201cWhat letter?\u201d\u201cA love letter to the prince.\u201dShe pulled a crumpled piece of paper out of her pocket and held it out.\u00a0\u201dWow,\u201d Peter exclaimed.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Is it too romantic?\u201d\u201cI need to decipher what you wrote.\u201dJenny laughed out loud and sat down on the bed.\u00a0Peter tried to concentrate and eagerly read down the letters on the paper.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Are you really going to send it like this?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too obvious.\u00a0Ugh, I felt it was fate as soon as we met.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that true?\u00a0I mean, I really felt it was fate.\u00a0Obviously, the prince and I must have been lovers in a previous life.\u201d\u201cWhy would you write that in your first letter?\u201dAs Peter read the letter, the expression on his face grew more and more somber.\u201c\u2026Why the hell does it end by adding that it\u2019s good to have a few children?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to discuss that in advance?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0This is really not the case.\u201dPeter shook his head.\u201cYou can\u2019t write a love letter like this.\u201dJenny pursed her lips.\u201cYou talk like someone who has written a lot.\u201dPeter pointed to the books piled up on the bookshelf.\u00a0There were a few romance novels in it.\u201cOkay.\u00a0Great.\u00a0So what should I write?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell him you love him all the time, what\u2019s more, um\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it be better to start plainly?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cJust.\u00a0Uhm, hello?\u00a0Something like this.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that boring?\u00a0Um, well, okay.\u00a0Just write it like that.\u201dPeter picked up the pen and started writing a new letter in Jenny\u2019s practice book.\u201cYou want to talk about the day you first met?\u201d\u201cOkay!\u00a0That day, the prince picked up the pen that Aunt Spencer bought for me! I was so thankful. Make sure you use that. It was a very special case for me. I\u2019m sure the prince remembers.\u201d\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t remember?\u201d\u201cThere is no way he won\u2019t remember!\u00a0It was so intense!\u00a0How could the prince forget something so important?\u201dPicking up another student\u2019s pen didn\u2019t seem like an intense experience, Peter tried to tell.\u00a0But Jenny\u2019s eyes were so bright that he couldn\u2019t do it.\u201cJust\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be better to arouse a little more curiosity?\u00a0Do you remember the moment we first met?\u00a0Like that. He\u2019ll be wondering when that was.\u201d\u201cOh!\u00a0Good!\u00a0Peter!\u00a0You are a genius!\u00a0All right, then, next.\u201dThe two sat side by side and completed the co-authorship of the love letter..\u00a0While they put their heads together and pondered for a while, Peter\u2019s mother opened the door and handed them lemonade.\u201cWhat are you working so hard on?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a writing assignment.\u201dPeter laughed and smiled.\u201cReally?\u00a0When you finish your writing homework, can you run an errand for your mom?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0What is it?\u201d\u201cGo to the supermarket and buy some oranges.\u00a0I think ten will be enough.\u00a0I need to make marmalade jam, but I don\u2019t have any oranges.\u201d\u201cWow!\u00a0Really?\u00a0Can I buy it right now?\u201dPeter, who loved his mother\u2019s orange marmalade so much, asked excitedly.\u201cYou have a guest over.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine.\u00a0I can come back later.\u00a0I wrote almost everything.\u201dJenny got up.\u00a0Peter looked at her with an apologetic face.\u201cNo.\u00a0You can go in a little while.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0Anyway, it was time for me to go home.\u00a0Actually, I have math homework too\u2026 Real homework.\u201dShe muttered with a sad face.\u00a0\u201dCheer up,\u201d Peter said and patted her on the shoulder.\u00a0As they went down the stairs, the two discussed the love letter they were working on together.\u201cHow long will it take to translate that into Korean?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I pick words, but, uh, it doesn\u2019t take much time. I\u2019ll do it quickly.\u201d\u201cThen, will everything be finished tonight?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0If I finish it, will you buy me something delicious?\u201d\u201cOf course. Of course.\u201dAfter Peter received money from his mother to buy the oranges, the two waved goodbye at the front door.\u201cWould you like to go with me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0Go alone.\u201d\u201cOkay then, go ahead.\u00a0See you next time.\u201d\u201cYeah. Bye.\u201dIt was a relationship where they could see each other at any time even if they seperated without making an appointment to see each other.\u00a0Peter put the money in his pocket and started walking towards the supermarket near his house.\u00a0Because of the sweltering weather, he was sweating profusely even though he only took a few steps.\u00a0He thought it was good that he came alone.\u00a0If he had brought Jenny in this kind of weather, it would have been an act of torture for her.After walking two blocks, Peter changed his mind.No matter how good marmalade was, it was too much for him to come out at this time.\u00a0Still, the mart was a little further away.On his way to the mart, he walked\u00a0 harder, comforting himself that he could enjoy the cold air of the air conditioner to his heart\u2019s content.Peter didn\u2019t like sports.\u00a0Because of his congenitally weak heart, he couldn\u2019t do vigorous exercise, so he didn\u2019t even have a chance to develop his motor nerves.\u00a0His introverted personality also played a part, so he didn\u2019t want to be seen acting clumsily in front of others.However, it was a fact that, not only the doctor but Peter and his family knew, he needed regular exercise.\u00a0In the end, his mother asked her son for walks like this, often disguised as errands.Usually, he was fooled by it, but today, Peter couldn\u2019t help but resent himself for falling for it.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dThe moment he opened the door of the supermarket with sweaty hands and entered, he took a long breath.\u00a0The air was mechanically chilled, but it felt good.\u00a0While carefully and slowly choosing ten oranges, Peter seriously pondered whether he should kill time at the mart until the sun went down.Peter, who had been standing by the door for a while with oranges in a brown envelope, could not stand the stinging glance of the clerk, opened the door and went out.Really\u00a0What was wrong with this heat?\u00a0If he could come this far, he might as well go back home.Peter grabbed the brown envelope in his arms and moved forward vigorously.\u00a0But he could only walk less than a block and sat down, blaming his recklessness.\u00a0Sitting under the shade, Peter waited for the sun to go down a bit.\u201c\u2026 whoever sees me will think that I am a vampire.\u201dPeter looked down at his thin, white arms with blue veins on them.\u00a0He felt a weakness that could not be compared with other male students of the same age.He wanted to be healthy.\u00a0He wanted to run around the playground as much as he wanted, he wanted to travel, and he wanted to run errands without any problems.Peter put the brown envelope aside and looked at the boys playing basketball on the court across the street.\u00a0Seeing them sweating and moving even under the scorching sunlight made him feel even worse.They ran around like wild animals on the grass.\u00a0How could they move while panting like that?Sitting on the bench, Peter watched the boys playing basketball incessantly.\u00a0Then, suddenly, a boy who looked particularly familiar among them caught his eye.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dPeter got up from his seat.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even notice that an orange fell to his feet.\u00a0Peter stared blankly across the street into the basketball court.It was the boy.\u00a0The moment he recognized him, the other people around him disappeared in the background.\u00a0Not because of his tall height, which was one more head than other students his age, but the boy had a recognizable presence.Versatile in all sports, Phillip flew among the other boys, as if to prove the rumor that the entire school athletics department salivated when he entered the school.\u00a0Even if he went to the basketball club instead of football, it was a skill that would not be inferior.Peter crossed the road as if possessed by something.\u00a0The desire to see him up close drove him back under the sun.Standing in front of the basketball court and the wire mesh blocking the sidewalk, Peter watched the boy playing basketball.Peter had forgotten what he was doing until a bang shook the wire.\u00a0Surprised by the sudden loud noise in front of his face, Peter shouted, \u201cAhh,\u201d and sat down on his seat.\u00a0The basketball hit the wire mesh and rolled into the court.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201d\u201cDo you know him?\u201dThe boys playing basketball on the court turned their eyes to Philip, pointing to the little Asian boy who was looking at them.Peter shook his shoulders in amazement like a man on fire.\u00a0If he spoke to him, what would he say?\u00a0If he asked him why he was looking at him, what should he say?\u00a0Ah, maybe it was a good thing.\u00a0His head went blank and he couldn\u2019t think of anything.If there was even a rumor that he was a strange stalker, he would never be able to set foot in the Korean Association again\u2026\u201cAcquaintance?\u201dWhen someone asked that again, Peter, who was wiping his face with a towel, shrugged his shoulders.Just that short gesture.\u00a0With that, Peter realized that he did not belong to his world.\u00a0He also realized how stupid he was, fidgeting for fear that he would recognize him.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dPhilip asked, lightly tapping the basketball on the floor..\u00a0Peter replied that he was fine and started picking up the oranges that he dropped on the floor when he fell.\u00a0Every time he picked up an orange and put it in the envelope, tears welled up.\u00a0He bit his lip and endured it, knowing that even death would not forgive him if he shed tears here.Peter looked around when he realized that there were only nine oranges that he picked up from the ground.There was an orange across the street.\u00a0Peter stood at the end of the sidewalk to cross the road.\u00a0All he had to do was pick it up and get out of there.\u00a0As he took his steps to cross the road, someone grabbed his arm from behind.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dBEEEP.The sound of a rippling horn barely passed in front of Peter.\u00a0He was covered in cold sweat.\u00a0If he was even a little late, he might not be in this world right now.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dA friendly voice came from behind.\u201cAh \u2026uh\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you fall because of the ball?\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWithout answering, Philip crossed the road and returned the orange that had been left behind.\u00a0He smiled and put the orange he had picked up into the envelope.It was over.\u00a0He turned around and ran back into the basketball court as if he didn\u2019t want to hear a thank you.\u201cH, Hey\u201dIt was the first time in his life that he had such courage.\u00a0Peter was surprised to see how red his face had turned when he returned home later.\u00a0But back then, that kind of thing was pretty good.Philip looked back.\u00a0With the wire mesh between them, their eyes met.\u00a0His heart was beating like it was going to explode.\u00a0Thinking it had to be now, Peter held out his hand.\u201cEa, eat this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u00a0You saved me.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter bit his tongue in his mouth as the words didn\u2019t come out properly.\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u201dThe moment he saw Philip smiling brightly after answering, Peter seemed to understand why Jenny called him a prince.Peter silently held out the orange he was holding.\u00a0Laughter was heard over the wire fence.\u00a0Philip reached out and touched the orange.\u201cCan I accept it from here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Ah.\u201dHe held out the orange in between the wire mesh .\u00a0It was safe to say that the other party saw him as a trembling child.As Peter bowed his head and said nothing, Philip whistled over the wire fence.\u00a0He pointed his finger over the pierced wire mesh.Peter threw the orange up.\u00a0The orange, which flew and crossed over to the other side of the wire mesh, landed safely in Philip\u2019s hand.\u201cI will eat well.\u201dWith those words, he went back into the world he belonged to.\u00a0Peter grabbed the bag of oranges and started walking hurriedly.Sweat dripped down his forehead and his heart ached like it was going to break.\u00a0The sound of an exhausted breath leaked out of his throat.\u00a0But he couldn\u2019t stop walking.As soon as he got home, his mother was shocked to see her son drenched in sweat and shouted what was going on, but Peter silently handed the envelope of oranges to his mother.\u201cWhat happened?\u00a0Are you okay?\u201dHis mother asked again and again, worried looking at her son\u2019s unusual appearance.\u00a0Peter just shook his head.\u201cAre you sick?\u00a0Shall we go to the hospital?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cAre you really okay?\u00a0You aren\u2019t sick?\u201dPeter silently shook his head.\u201cAre you really okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I\u2019m okay.\u00a0I\u2019ll just go upstairs and rest.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHis mother, who was taking the oranges out of the envelope, mumbled to herself, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s one missing.\u201d\u00a0Peter, who was going up the stairs, heard the words and began to climb the stairs two at a time like someone being chased.After entering the room, he closed the door, and laid on the bed, and he gasped for breath for a long time, but his pounding heart did not calm down.Peter covered his face with both hands.His thoughts ran back to the missing orange, and the incomprehensible feeling in his mind forced him to lie awake in bed for a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s do what we said before and if it doesn\u2019t work, we can do it this way.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was listening to the conversation between the director and the action director, carefully handed them a warm drink.\u201cOh.\u00a0Manager.\u00a0thanks.\u201d\u201cWe only need to film this scene today, so work hard.\u201dInseop, who was diligent and sincere, was well-received among the on-site staff.\u00a0The people who murmured behind the scenes saying, \u201cHe does his job properly because he\u2019s young,\u201d now had a different view because of his meticulous handling of work.\u201cWould it be okay?\u201dChoi Inseop asked the director.\u201cIt will be fine.\u00a0Since he said it.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said he can\u2019t say no, and that he\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026 I heard it\u2019s not just riding a horse today.\u201dWhat they had to film today was a scene where Lee Wooyeon was hit by an arrow while riding a horse and he would fall to the floor.\u00a0He was told that the horse must also fall down, and that, if they tied an invisible thin thread to the horse\u2019s leg and pulled it, it would fall at the exact moment it should fall.However, even after hearing all those explanations, Inseop could not shake the anxiety that was rising.\u201cDo not worry.\u00a0All the horses are trained, so you can be assured that they\u2019ll act well.\u201dThe action director also helped and relieved Inseop\u2019s worries.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cIs it so?\u201d and shook his head helplessly.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Did the company threaten you to pay if Lee Wooyeon got hurt?\u201dWhen the director joked, Inseop was surprised and waved his hand.\u201cNo.\u00a0The president is absolutely not one to make such threats.\u00a0Since he is a really good person, I sincerely\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cHahahahaha.\u00a0Just kidding, why are you denying it so seriously?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you really being threatened?\u201dLee Wooyeon placed his hand on Inseop\u2019s head, who was not sure what to do between the two directors.\u201cDon\u2019t bully my manager too much.\u201d\u201cAre we bullying?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\u201cHe looks like he\u2019s in pain.\u201dLee Wooyeon moved his face from behind to look at Inseop\u2019s expression.\u00a0Choi Inseop turned pale, like a person being approached by a monster.Lee Wooyeon smiled and patted his shoulder.\u201cI\u2019m going to explain the scene one more time.\u201dInseop glanced at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s profile, giving detailed instructions to the director. Lee Wooyeon, who finished talking with the director, found Inseop looking and smiled.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cAh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Are you okay?\u201d\u201cYou asked that question 10 minutes ago, and I will answer it again.\u00a0I\u2019m okay.\u201dLee Wooyeon responded by waving his bandaged hand in front of Inseop.\u00a0He felt apologetic to the staff and other actors, but Inseop actually wanted Lee Wooyeon\u2019s filming to be delayed.\u201cThe President told you not to overdo it.\u201dInseop finally sold CEO Kim.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon nodded his head as if he knew.\u00a0However,he did not say that the filming would be delayed.Watching him go horseback riding with the shooting team, Inseop let out a sigh.\u201cWhy is a young man like you so worried?\u201dThe director who was checking the camera angle asked\u201cI\u2019m just worried.\u201dInseop laughed weakly.\u201cIf anyone sees you, they\u2019ll think you\u2019re a woman who worries about her husband who went to the battlefield.\u201dAlthough he did not exactly understand the meaning, Inseop shook his head, denying it.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cBut it looks like that.\u00a0Hahaha.\u00a0Anyway, don\u2019t worry too much.\u00a0An actor who is as confident in self-management as Lee Wooyeon is usually not hurt.\u201dWhen the director said that, Inseop\u2019s anxiety subsided a little.\u00a0The director left to check the location of the camera.Sitting on a tree stump, Inseop blew a breath on his frozen fingertips, praying for Lee Wooyeon to finish filming today.\u201cCome quickly, come quickly.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly.\u00a0Step on it, quickly.\u201dCEO Kim, who was contacted while having a drink, called manager Cha and shouted that he had to go to the hospital immediately.\u00a0Manager Cha, who ran out without sleeping, still couldn\u2019t decide what the situation was.\u201cSo, Lee Wooyeon got hurt again?\u201dRecalling the memory of receiving a phone call from Inseop saying that Lee Wooyeon had injured his hand earlier in the day, manager Cha asked.\u201cNo, I mean, Lee Wooyeon was also injured, but he was only bruised, and this time Inseop was injured.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u00a0Taking turns, huh?\u201d\u201cI fucking know.\u00a0Ah really.\u00a0It\u2019s disturbing how many times this has already happened.\u201dCEO Kim clicked his tongue nervously.\u00a0He was still busy with the listing review, but because of Lee Wooyeon, he thought that it had become more common these days.\u201cIs Inseop okay?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was angry and hung up the phone, so I couldn\u2019t even ask.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is Lee Wooyeon angry?\u201dManager Cha, who was driving, was surprised and asked.\u00a0Although Lee Wooyeon had a filthy temper, he never got angry with CEO Kim.\u00a0He has never seen him show his anger so openly.\u00a0He only grinned and annoyed people from the inside.\u201cThat\u2019s right..\u00a0He was so cruel that I didn\u2019t even ask in detail and hung up.\u201d\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\u201cCome to the hospital quickly.\u00a0And\u2026 He said he was going to kill Kang Youngmo.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why don\u2019t we just remove Lee Wooyeon from the drama now?\u00a0Wouldn\u2019t it be better to swear a little now and plan for the future before making a mistake?\u201dManager Cha made his opinion cautiously.\u00a0CEO Kim, who was sitting in the back seat, firmly closed his lips and shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s under review for listing right now, so if something like that happens, it\u2019s fatal.\u00a0No way.\u00a0Ah really.\u00a0Last time we went out, we managed to prevent an accident, but now, how did this happen again?\u00a0Anyway, right now, reporters are scrambling to see if there is anything that would fall on Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cReporter Kim Haeshin?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0It\u2019s terrible.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon got bitten by the worst one.\u201dIt seemed that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s refusal of all interviews related to Kim Haeshin after that day had fueled her desire to win.CEO Kim, who had a frown on his forehead, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit odd to say this,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cChoi Inseop, the kid is nice\u2026\u00a0 but don\u2019t you think these incident\u2019s of Lee Wooyeon is weird?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say he\u2019d sign a contract for the rest of his life?\u201d\u201cThis is the third time Lee Wooyeon has been injured since he came in.\u00a0He\u2019s good at his job and he\u2019s nice, but anyway, after he came in, accidents around Lee Wooyeon keep happening, so it\u2019s a bad feeling\u2026\u00a0After saying this, I feel very sorry for Inseop.\u201d\u201cIf you know you\u2019re sorry, be nice to Inseop.\u00a0Do you know how sincere he is?\u00a0He\u2019s a kid who comes out early in the morning, prepares breakfast, prepares coffee forLee Wooyeon and goes out every week to check the schedule.\u201dIn the eyes of Manager Cha, who had been a manager in the field, Choi Inseop was the best manager.\u201cWho knows?\u00a0It\u2019s just that after Inseop became the manager, Lee Wooyeon had a lot of accidents\u00a0\u2026Would it be good?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re a person who goes to church every week and prays.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying it because it\u2019s frustrating, hey. Really.\u201dHearing CEO Kim grumbling, the car manager stepped on the accelerator.\u201cUh\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon raised his head at the sound of someone calling him.\u00a0It was one of the nurses who peeked inside before.\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, could you please sign it for me?\u00a0Because I\u2019m really a fan\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was leaning on the bed with his chin resting on his hand, frowned.Normally, he would have smiled and signed a few autographs, but now he didn\u2019t feel like it.\u201cSorry.\u00a0I will do it later.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even respond kindly.\u201cWait then, even a picture\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCrazy bitches, she was a nurse. How could she ask that in this situation?Lee Wooyeon looked at her face for a long time and then turned his head.In the end, the nurse, who had been waiting for a while, could not overcome her embarrassment and returned to her seat.Lee Wooyeon looked down at the manager\u2019s face, lying on the bed.\u00a0Seeing the scars all over the bridge of the nose and cheeks made him feel very sick.He felt strange when he heard about the manager who had previously jumped into the icy water to rescue him from the lake.\u00a0It was because he did not understand the situation itself of risking his life for others.\u00a0Besides, he clearly believed that Choi Inseop hated him.\u00a0It was him who had a strange feeling about things that did not match, so he decided to keep Inseop by his side and watch over him.But today, something happened again that Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t understand.\u00a0There was an accident where the reins were cut in a scene where he had to fall when he was on the horseback.\u00a0Just before the horse\u2019s leg touched the ground, the reins were cut, and in an instant, Lee Wooyeon lost his center of gravity.\u00a0As Lee Wooyeon plummeted to the floor, people around him screamed.\u00a0After that, the horse lost its composure.\u00a0No matter how well trained, horses were basically timid animals.\u00a0To make matters worse, Kang Youngmo, following from behind, passed right in front of him without slowing down, so Lee Wooyeon\u2019s horses panicked and started to struggle.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s feet were caught in the stirrups, so he couldn\u2019t get up right away.\u00a0Because of the scene of riding a horse, the shoes that were purposely secured with cloth around the ankles did not come off no matter how much force was applied.\u00a0The horse was so agitated that no one rushed to help.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon felt a strong pain near his shoulder when he got up and tried to pull his foot out.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t move as he had planned, perhaps because his shoulder touched the horse first and was dislocated.\u00a0At that time, Lee Wooyeon saw Choi Inseop\u2019s white and tired face running towards him.\u00a0Seeing Choi Inseop, who was very frightened, reached out his hand to the stirrup that was hanging on the running horse, Lee Wooyeon thought.\u2018Did you save me while trembling like this before?\u00a0With such a frightened face?\u00a0You\u2019re saying you saved me by doing that pathetic thing?\u2019\u2018Go!\u2019Lee Wooyeon probably screamed like that.\u00a0However, Inseop grabbed the stirrup with his trembling hands and pushed out Lee Wooyeon\u2019s feet.\u00a0But as Inseop approached, the horse became even more scared and agitated and rushed towards Lee Wooyeon, swinging his front paws.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon closed his eyes and bowed his head.\u00a0However, it wasn\u2019t the horse\u2019s paws that struck him, but Choi Inseop\u2019s slender body.\u00a0Then, with a popping sound, a heavy feeling of weight was felt.\u00a0Hearing Inseop\u2019s scream, Lee Wooyeon reached out and embraced his body, barely rolling to the side.The zookeeper heard the news and ran to calm the situation.\u00a0However, strangely, he could not easily quieten the horse and it ran wild for a long time.\u00a0After seeing some of the staff rushing and barely dragging the horse out, Lee Wooyeon checked Choi Inseop, who was lying under him.\u2018Are you okay?\u00a0Are you hurt?\u2019Inseop, terrified, crouched down and trembled, unable to answer properly.\u00a0He was so pitiful and miserable that it was hard to keep his eyes open.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon held Inseop\u2019s shoulder, holding back his anger over why he intervened.\u00a0As he tried to hold him up and lift him up, Inseop screamed and burst into tears.\u00a0It was at the same time that a fire spread in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s head, who discovered that Inseop\u2019s two fingers were twisted in a strange shape.Lee Wooyeon yelled at the staff to prepare a car and find the nearest hospital.\u00a0He thought it was not his usual reaction, but he couldn\u2019t contain his anger at that time.\u00a0No, he didn\u2019t even think of that.The only thought was that Choi Inseop, who was trembling with tears in his arms, should be taken to the hospital immediately.\u2018It\u2019s okay.\u00a0It\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry.\u2019Lee Wooyeon wrapped a blanket around Choi Inseop\u2019s body and spoke.\u00a0Perhaps understanding his words, Inseop nodded his head slightly as tears fell.The director ran up to him and asked if he was okay.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon replied that he would be going to the hospital, so filming had to be delayed, and he got into the car.As he drove in the car, he comforted Choi Inseop from crying and thought about why he was so angry, but couldn\u2019t come up with an answer.\u00a0In the end, Choi Inseop vomited and passed out, and Lee Wooyeon yelled at the staff who was guarding the signal, what the hell were they doing?It was Lee Wooyeon who carried Choi Inseop into the emergency room.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon suddenly appeared in the emergency room, doctors and nurses as well as patients were surprised.However, Lee Wooyeon did not see any of that.\u00a0He stood expressionless with his arms crossed next to Choi Inseop until he heard from the doctor that he had no problems other than a broken bone and that he passed out because of the shock.After confirming that Inseop was asleep, Lee Wooyeon calmly told the staff who had accompanied him to the hospital that it would be okay to return as he would keep staying with him.\u00a0When he called the director, he told him not to worry and that it would be fine.\u00a0He knew that nothing really happened.Still, he didn\u2019t feel any better.\u00a0It seemed that this maddening anger would only be alleviated by twisting the head of the horse to death right now.That\u2019s when Kang Youngmo called.\u00a0\u2019How do you get hurt like that?\u00a0Is the manager okay?\u00a0Really, no luck.\u00a0How could such an accident happen?\u00a0If you want, I don\u2019t care if you leave now, but everyone is worried, so get well soon and see you on set.\u2019\u00a0Lee Wooyeon briefly replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d and hung up the phone.\u00a0As if on purpose, when he remembered the face of Kang Youngmo, who passed in front of him, his cursing rose.Lee Wooyeon called CEO Kim to come here right away.\u00a0After finishing the call, he went into the emergency room and Lee Wooyeon sat down next to Choi Inseop\u2019s bed.Inseop fell into a deep sleep as he was given a ringer mixed with sedatives and painkillers, and he never woke up.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon even put her finger under Inseop\u2019s nose to see if this bastard was really alive.Previous

I just said it once.\u201d\u201cIf you want to fire him, you have to fire me.\u00a0I\u2019m really unlucky these days.\u00a0Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cHey, Lee Wooyeon, why are you like this?\u00a0Why are you upset about firing Choi Inseop? Why are you acting different?\u201dWhen CEO Kim asked with a sincere expression, Lee Wooyeon answered with a sweet voice as if confessing his love with a pretty smile.\u201cI feel like shit, now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI have been like this since I was little.\u00a0Even if I hear mosquitoes buzzing in my ears while I was sleeping, I could never go back to sleep until I woke up in the middle of the night to catch the mosquito.\u00a0Even if I had to stay up all night.\u00a0I found that getting rid of anything that bothered me was the smart thing to do.\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s your personality\u2026\u00a0\u00a0okay.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a thing that really gets on my nerves right now, and I\u2019m curious about how to get rid of it, and it\u2019s not comfortable to have it next to me.\u201dBefore even asking what he meant, Lee Wooyeon shrugged and pretended to smile.\u201cSo, I make the decisions about Mr. Inseop.\u00a0Did you understand?\u201dIf he said he did not understand, he thought he would be hit with a brick or a knife while going down the street someday, so CEO Kim nodded his head.\u201cOkay\u2026\u00a0But are you okay?\u00a0You fell off the horse.\u201dCEO Kim carefully looked around Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body.\u201cI think my shoulder is out.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Shoulder?\u00a0Then what are you doing without getting treatment?\u201d\u201cI forgot.\u201d\u201cThere is something else to forget, ah, really.\u00a0Go get an X-ray right now and get treatment.\u00a0Are you crazy?!\u00a0You!\u201dLee Wooyeon stood up and answered.\u201cDoes the CEO still think I\u2019m sane?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a joke.\u201dLooking at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s soft smile, CEO Kim thought that if he hadn\u2019t seen that scene back then, he would have been deceived until now.Feeling the weight of the truth, CEO Kim shook his aching head.Fortunately, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder only had some stretched ligaments, so he was told that it would be okay if he rested for a while.\u00a0The problem was that Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t take a break even for a while.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dChoi Inseop was asleep on the bed, and Lee Wooyeon sat on the bed next to him.\u00a0Manager Cha and CEO Kim remained in the emergency room under the pretext of being the guardians of each of them.\u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201cThe shooting.\u00a0I think I will have to adjust my schedule for the time being.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to shoot all night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better if you put some paste on it and steam it.\u201d\u201cHowever, the ligaments are stretched\u2026\u201d\u201cThere will be no overdoing.\u201dIn response to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s decisive answer, CEO Kim nodded without a word.\u00a0Then the cell phone rang.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled out his cell phone from his pocket, checked the name, and answered the call right away.Then, a nearby nurse politely asked him to leave the emergency room because he couldn\u2019t answer the phone.\u201cSorry.\u00a0It\u2019s an urgent call, so I\u2019ll only talk for a moment.\u201d\u201cThe use of it inside the emergency room is prohibited because cell phones can damage devices through radio waves.\u00a0So\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon said, \u201cOh,\u201d and clasped his shoulder with one hand and pretended to lean on the bed.\u00a0Unknowingly, the nurse reached out and supported him with how sad that expression was.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0My shoulder hurts, so I took painkillers, but the effect doesn\u2019t seem to work yet.\u00a0I\u2019ll go out and talk to him first.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon mumbled that with a lonely face, the nurse who was holding the chart thought for a moment and then began to pull the curtain installed on the bed.\u00a0After creating an independent space by covering all sides with a curtain, the nurse smiled and disappeared, saying that he should finish soon.Seeing Lee Wooyeon smiling kindly and holding his cell phone next to his ear, CEO Kim and manager Cha clicked their tongues with a face like they couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m in the hospital, yes, did you inquire?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was holding the phone, quietly answered yes, yes, yes.\u00a0Then, he changed the hand holding the phone and furrowed his eyebrows like he didn\u2019t like what he heard.\u201cThat\u2019s none of my business. Yes, make sure you have it within a week. Alright. Thank you.When Lee Wooyeon smiled and hung up the phone, CEO Kim asked.\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cSomeone I used to know in America.\u00a0There was something I asked for, and it has almost been resolved.\u201d\u201cWhat are you asking for?\u00a0What do you want?\u201dLee Wooyeon laid his body on the bed and answered indifferently.\u201cThose Korean-Chinese jerks. Who tried to drown me\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Did you find them?\u201dLee Wooyeon put his finger on his lips to tell him to shush and lower his voice.\u00a0CEO Kim lowered his voice with a sign of disapproval and asked questions one after another.\u201cHow did you find them?\u00a0Even the police couldn\u2019t find them.\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t find them because they are police officers.\u00a0I can find them all if I want.\u00a0People keep leaving traces as long as they live.\u201d\u201cSo, did you report it to the police?\u201d\u201cWhy would I report it?\u201dLee Wooyeon opened his eyes and made a face asking what he meant.\u201cThen you should report it to the police.\u00a0What are you going to do?\u201d\u201cI have to bury them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI think Korea has a lot of mountains.\u00a0When I was filming in the countryside and climbing up, every place I looked at was a mountain.\u00a0I think Korea is called the land with beautiful scenery because there are many mountains.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon spoke with a happy smile, a chill ran through the backs of the two men.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, do you know that burying people in the wild is a crime?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dAfter a subtle silence passed, CEO Kim licked his dry lips with his tongue and opened his mouth with difficulty.\u201cSo you mean that you are going to find those people now and bury them in the wild?\u00a0Are you saying that?\u201dLee Wooyeon replied \u201cyes\u201d and smiled brightly like a child.\u00a0CEO Kim said, \u201cI\u2019m glad this is a hospital emergency room, I won\u2019t die even if I collapse,\u201d and grabbed the back of his neck.\u201cHey, Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0\u2026 You can\u2019t bury people.\u201dManager Cha, who couldn\u2019t watch, said .\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said, \u201cI know,\u201d and added a few words as he thought it was not enough.\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to hit people from behind and throw them into the lake. It\u2019s illegal.\u201dThe faces of the two who were listening to those words gradually turned pale.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon laid his body down and asked calmly.\u201cYou didn\u2019t really believe that I was going to bury people in the wild, did you?\u201dTo that question, both of them could not immediately answer.\u00a0No matter how benevolent Lee Wooyeon smiled, it was only an abomination to those who knew his true face.\u201cOf course I\u2019m joking, I\u2019m joking.\u201dEven if Lee Wooyeon said this jokingly, the two of them could not afford to take it as a joke when they saw him holding a blood-stained bottle in a bar.\u201cBy the way, if you find them, are you really not going to report them to the police?\u00a0It would be better to report it instead of making it a big deal.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0okay.\u201dHe answered yes, but never said he would.\u201cIt\u2019s the third time that Inseop saved his life by chance.\u00a0Hey, if you\u2019re saved three times, shouldn\u2019t you put up a statue in front of your house?\u00a0Loyal manager, Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201cThird?\u201dLee Wooyeon tilted his head slightly.\u00a0According to his memory, until today, that asshole manager rescued him and laid him down twice, but he didn\u2019t know when the third time happened.\u201cThen after he rescued you from the lake\u2026 uhmm.\u201dManager Cha covered CEO Kim\u2019s mouth with the palm of his hand.\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dManager Cha tried to hide it, but Lee Wooyeon saw what had happened.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing?\u00a0What happened?\u00a0When did Inseop save my life other than these?\u201dManager Cha said, \u201cAh, really,\u201d and looked at CEO Kim.\u00a0Obviously, after that incident, Inseop came to them and asked them to keep it a secret from Lee Wooyeon, but CEO Kim said it without realizing.\u201cHow did he save my life?\u201dLee Wooyeon looked directly at CEO Kim and asked.\u00a0CEO Kim scratched his head and replied, \u201cErr, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cAt that time, he got you out of the water and he gave you artificial respiration, so you survived.\u00a0Your heart stopped for a moment.\u00a0According to the paramedics, if Inseop hadn\u2019t treated you correctly, you might have died even if you had been rescued from the water.\u201d\u201cMouth to mouth?\u201d\u201cThen artificial respiration through your nostril\u2026\u201dBefore CEO Kim could finish speaking, he heard the sound of something falling over from the bed next to him.\u00a0As the three of them turned their gazes to the side, they caught sight of something lingering under the curtain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He couldn\u2019t ask Inseop, who came to his senses while having such a conversation, if he was okay.Lee Wooyeon stood next to Inseop\u2019s bed and asked kindly.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Are there any uncomfortable places other than your fingers?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026I\u2019m okay.\u201dHearing his crying voice, Lee Wooyeon pointed his finger at the sheet and frowned at CEO Kim.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0You\u2019re okay?\u00a0You aren\u2019t sick?\u201d\u201cI am\u2026 okay.\u201dIt was hard to see how much he was trembling inside the sheet.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed the sheet with his hands and opened it.\u201cAre you really okay?\u201dWhen the protective sheet was removed, Inseop\u2019s eyes widened in surprised.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon reached out and touched Inseop\u2019s forehead.\u201cYou have a fever.\u00a0How many days will you be hospitalized?\u00a0They said there will be a hospital room tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u00a0I will be discharged.\u201dInseop looked anxiously at the small amount of IV liquid and swallowed.\u00a0He just wanted to get rid of the IV and run away.\u201cThe payment is finished.\u00a0If you finish the IV, you can go.\u201dManager Cha returned waving his receipt.\u00a0The four men\u00a0 all looked at the IV bottle at once.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon waited happily with his arms crossed at the sight of the IV\u2019s liquid dripping down, Manager Cha and CEO Kim looked apologetic, and Inseop bit his lip looking like a death row prisoner waiting to be sentenced to death.Finally, the last drop of the IV dripped onto the hose.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon raised his hand to the nurse and asked her to come over.\u201cThen let\u2019s go now.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know why those words made his heart sink, Choi Inseop closed his eyes.\u201cWe will get off here.\u201dLee Wooyeon said so while holding Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0Throughout the ride, Inseop eagerly expressed his wish that he would return home, but Lee Wooyeon shook his head saying that he could not leave a patient alone and that he had something to ask.\u201cI\u2019ll just go to my house\u2026\u201dEven when he saw Lee Wooyeon getting off, Inseop grabbed the seat belt of the car and closed his eyes.\u00a0However, without waiting, Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop and pulled him out of the car.\u201cManager Cha.\u00a0Please postpone all my schedules for tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhat?

Lee Wooyeon stood with his arms crossed and brushed up on Inseop again.\u201cWater must not get into the cast.\u00a0What if the wound rots?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I will do my best.\u201dIn response, Choi Inseop quickly burst into tears at the words that his wounds would rot.\u00a0Hee felt like standing like this, and wanted to explain how maggots infest the wound after it heals for 10 minutes and how terrible the smell of a rotten wound is, but for today, he wanted to stop at this point.Lee Wooyeon smiled and said, \u201cHang on then,\u201d and brought something from the kitchen and handed it to Inseop.\u201cCover around the cast with this.\u00a0Don\u2019t let it get wet.\u201dIt was a wrap.\u00a0Inseop nodded eagerly, thinking that he would be able to wear a cast in one hand by himself.When the wrap was handed over and the door closed, Inseop opened his eyes and breathed a sigh of relief for the first time.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon said something again, his voice was muffled,and\u00a0 attacked him from outside the door.\u201cCall me if you think you won\u2019t be able to shower.\u00a0I will help you.\u201dChoi Inseop said in a trembling voice, \u201cThank you for your words, but it\u2019s really fine,\u201d and then locked the bathroom door.After confirming that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s laughter was getting farther away, he just sat down on the bathroom floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lee Wooyeon swallowed a laugh. When he said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk after taking a shower,\u201d and told him to wait for a while, Inseop\u2019s whole body turned red and he nodded silently.Lee Wooyeon honestly enjoyed the attitude of Inseop, who acted like a virgin who was dragged to the hotel even though he only said he was taking a shower. So he purposely took a shower more leisurely than usual and came out without proper clothes. He was going to relax and watch how much Choi Inseop was shaking.But, was he sleeping?\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon sat on the sofa, put his hands together, and stared blankly at Choi Inseop, who was dozing like a sick chick.Well, it was like that last time too.\u00a0He even had a nosebleed because he was stressed, and then he covered his nose with a tissue and fell asleep.\u00a0At this point, Lee Wooyeon was confused as to whether he was fearful or bold.Lee Wooyeon sat across from Choi Inseop, who was sleeping.\u00a0His left hand with bandage was hurt from the blade that was enclosed in the letter sent by the stalker and his right hand with a splint and half cast on was so pitiful that it was hard to believe that he was working as an actor\u2019s manager.Come to think of it, he lost some weight.When he lowered his head slightly and looked at his twitching face, it seemed that his cheeks that had some baby fat had become slightly thinner.It has been tough these days.\u00a0He barely slept and waited all day on set.\u00a0Inseop, like other managers, did not have the guts to joke around or do other things out of sight, watching the actors moderately, so he always stood there tensedly.Seeing him dozing off, he even looked like a minor who had not yet graduated from school.\u00a0It was unbelievable that a man who was so skinny had saved his life twice, no, three times.When he remembered that Inseop gave him artificial respiration, his eyes naturally moved to his lips.\u2018You put those lips on me?\u2019Lee Wooyeon touched the tip of his lips with his finger.\u00a0He wondered how the cowardly manager would have rubbed his lips while trembling.\u00a0He felt it a bit unfair that he didn\u2019t remember that.He decided to wake Inseop.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201dWhen he shook his slightly bent shoulders a couple of times, Choi Inseop jumped up from his seat, startled like a man on fire.\u201cNo!\u00a0I didn\u2019t sleep!\u00a0I just closed my eyes for a moment.\u201d\u201cWipe the drool off your lips.\u201dInseop gently wiped the side of his lips with an embarrassed expression, but there was nothing.\u00a0His face turned red at the thought that he had been pranked again.\u201cAre you tired?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cAre your hands okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Thank you for your concern.\u201dTo be honest, it was still throbbing and hurt so much that he screamed whenever he swiped it, but Inseop responded like an adult, straightening his back.\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then we can talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInseop thought it would\u2019ve been better if he rolled over in pain. He couldn\u2019t believe they were getting straight to the point.He waited for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s next words, not knowing where to look, as the cold sweat ran down his back.\u201cI have a question for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHolding his heart that was about to burst, Choi Inseop looked only at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips.\u201cWhy me\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI had no choice.\u00a0I thought you would be offended if you found out about it, so I asked other people to keep it a secret.\u00a0I brush my teeth three times a day, and I don\u2019t have any mouth-to-mouth disease.\u201dIt was like a magic bag from which stories poured out with a slap on the side.\u00a0When Inseop put his hand on his lap and looked ahead and uttered the lines he had prepared and memorized, Lee Wooyeon shook his shoulders and burst into laughter.\u201cHahahaha, no, it\u2019s not\u2026 hahaha, of course I was going to ask about that later, hahahaha.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cHa ha ha, yes.\u00a0But that\u2019s not what I was going to ask, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It isn\u2019t?\u201dHe was done for.Why did he think that artificial respiration was the question that Lee Wooyeon had brought him to his place to ask?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He wished that someone could hit his body with a big hammer and shove him into the ground so that he didn\u2019t have to face this.\u201cFor now, let\u2019s move on to that.\u00a0Of course, I\u2019m curious about the specifics, but I\u2019ll ask later.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dAs much as possible, Inseop wished that the latter would not be asked before he left Korea.\u201cI am curious about something else.\u00a0There is something you should know before answering.\u201dAs he said those words, the smile on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face slowly disappeared.\u00a0Instead, there was a cold look on his face.\u201cI don\u2019t care about issues that don\u2019t concern me whether someone else cheats on me or not. But I want to hear the truth at all costs when it comes to what I care about and what I\u2019m curious about. Now I want to hear the truth.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dChoi Inseop was scared because he wondered what kind of question he was trying to ask so grandly.Maybe he found out something about him.\u00a0Maybe he figured out that he was working as a manager under a fake identityAt that thought, his fingertips became cold and his lips were dry.\u00a0However, not wanting to show that he was nervous, Choi Inseop tried to pretend nothing was wrong and raised his head.\u201cSo, please answer my questions honestly.\u00a0Can you promise me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I will.\u201dTheir eyes met.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked Inseop the question in a calm and relaxed tone.\u201cWhy did you save me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhy did you save me twice, even if I did something I can\u2019t remember, three times, three times?\u00a0Why?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m a human being, because I\u2019m a manager,don\u2019t give me the old-fashioned answer.\u201dIt was embarrassing.He expected Lee Wooyeon to ask a question that was out of the ordinary, but he never dreamed that such a question would come to him.\u00a0In addition, when even the most plausible answers he could give were blocked, the thoughts in Inseop\u2019s head evaporated like a white sheet of paper.\u201cIt\u2019s winter and you jump into the lake without any preparation.\u00a0It;s suicide.\u00a0This can be done in return for saving you from such a thing in the bathroom.\u00a0But it\u2019s too much for a reward.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon continued to speak, counting on his fingers one by one.\u201cArtificial respiration is disgusting, but if you rinse your mouth later, that\u2019s enough.\u00a0But I don\u2019t remember this, so I wonder if it\u2019s true even after hearing it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElegant, long fingers were bent a second time.\u201cBut I really don\u2019t understand what happened today.\u00a0Because of what happened today, even the things that preceded it are actually confusing.\u00a0So I really wanted to hear it.\u00a0Why are you acting like a frantic person for not being able to save me from danger?\u00a0Oh right.\u00a0I\u2019m also going to ignore the answer that it\u2019s because you\u2019re my fan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201dAfter losing the last excuse to give, Inseop\u2019s mind went blank.\u00a0What the hell was he supposed to say?\u201cThink slowly.\u00a0Because I have a lot of time.\u201dLee Wooyeon leaned on the backrest and spoke casually.\u00a0However, his eyes were on Choi Inseop and did not let go as before.It felt like\u00a0 his head was being pierced by the tenacious gaze.\u00a0Choi Inseop let out a small sigh and began to desperately think of an answer.\u201cI\u2026\u00a0So \u2026\u00a0honestly\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, be honest.\u201dLee Wooyeon decided that he will decide his course of action based on what answers Choi Inseop gives him. He realized today that he can no longer have Choi Inseop by his side for reasons such as not understanding him or that he was interesting to watch.As CEO Kim pointed out today, he thought that it was only a matter of time before his dirty personality was revealed.\u00a0If his personality was exposed and his image was damaged, he had to quit as an actor.\u00a0He had earned enough money to survive for the rest of his life.\u00a0He started his acting career in the first place on a whim to fuck his father over, who sent him to Korea as a form of curing himself.\u00a0Then, it was not illegal to deceive people, and he made money to the point where his father\u2019s blood pressure went up and he collapsed.\u00a0Even if he had to quit his job as an actor, it wasn\u2019t sad or difficult for him.It was only unpleasant that he had to resign forcibly rather than by his own will.Lee Wooyeon liked to control his emotions.\u00a0However, if he was by Choi Inseop\u2019s side, he often lost his reason.\u00a0Today aswell, he felt a strong and warm emotion spreading in his heart the moment he saw Inseop, who ran to rescue him while trembling.The tingling feeling around his heart was both unpleasant and somewhat awkward, making it uncomfortable.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to be swayed by a feeling he had never felt before without knowing why.\u201cTell me please.\u201dLee Wooyeon stared intently at his manager, whose lips were moistened like a student being scolded by a teacher.\u201cI\u2026\u00a0I, someone, never again\u2026\u201dHe wanted to look elsewhere, but at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s persistent staring, Inseop could not even turn his head, listing the words in his head.\u201cNever again\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t want anyone next to me to die or get hurt.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was looking at him with his hand on his chin, slightly frowned.\u00a0Inseop took a breath and exhaled.\u201cAs long as I\u2019m by your side, I don\u2019t want to let that happen.\u201d\u201cAfter all, you are talking about the preciousness of life.\u201dLee Wooyeon clicked his tongue as if he relaxed.\u00a0Inseop stubbornly shook his head saying no.\u201cI am not talking about the preciousness or dignity of human life, but \u2026\u00a0It\u2019s just my desire.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if Lee Wooyeon would believe it, but everything he was saying now was sincere.Choi Inseop never wanted to experience someone else dying again.\u00a0Even if it was something that happened naturally in life, it was his honest greed that he didn\u2019t want to go through something like that again right now.\u201cWhen my best friend died\u2026\u00a0I couldn\u2019t protect her.\u201dOnce the truth began to burst, it began to flow out like water from a hole in the bucket.\u00a0Even though he knew he didn\u2019t have to say these words, Inseop couldn\u2019t stop his lips from moving.\u201cSo I want to protect you.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to go through that loss again.\u00a0This is just a personal desire.\u00a0It is not a noble feeling of humanity.\u201d\u201cThen you mean you\u2019re going to save whoever it is?\u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not me, right?\u201dInseop did not see the crooked smile on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips as he asked that question.\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s not like that\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0While I am working as a manager next to you, during that time, if there is anything I can do\u2026\u00a0I want to do anything.\u00a0It is all my desire.\u201dIt felt like a ball of fire was spitting out of his throat when he said that.\u00a0It was sincere and true.\u00a0Even if the day comes when he betrayed him, he wants to do everything he can until then. He wanted to do it even though he knew it was all greed, useless greed, and useless desires.So, the moment Lee Wooyeon rolled off his horse, his body moved before his head could make a decision.\u00a0Knowing not to approach the frightened horse, he ran to rescue him.\u00a0Even when the horse swung its front paws and ran towards him, he embraced him without realizing it.\u201cI just want to.\u00a0So it was\u2026\u00a0If you ask why, there is nothing I can say.\u00a0I just want to do it, from my heart.\u201dIt was useless to repeat to himself that he hated Lee Wooyeon and that he was a bad bastard.\u00a0Even if he tried to make up his mind while thinking of Jennie, I had already gone so far in the past.\u00a0Inseop had to accept that even if he betrayed him, he could never hate him.\u201cI just want to do something\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon tried to mumble what Choi Inseop had said quietly in his mouth.\u00a0Hearing what the other person was saying in his own voice made him feel weird, and Inseop\u2019s face flushed brightly.\u201cAnything I want?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s something I can do.\u201d\u201cOkay, then.\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed a finger at his lips and said.\u201cThen kiss me.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cKiss me.\u00a0Now.\u201dAs he listened to his words, Choi Inseop became confused as to whether the kiss he knew had the meaning.\u00a0Inseop blinked his eyes and made a face that he did not understand the current situation.\u201cYou say you can do anything you can.\u00a0Artificial respiration or kissing, it\u2019s the same thing.\u00a0Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cuh\u2026\u00a0Why\u2026 Why\u2026\u00a0This?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u00a0Was what you said earlier a lie?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon said that like he was disappointed, Choi Inseop shook his head saying it was not like that..\u201cI didn\u2019t just say it, but \u2026\u00a0Why are you saying this\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cI want to make sure that what Choi Inseop said to me is sincere.\u00a0If you want to overdo it, you don\u2019t have to.\u00a0I will leave the answer to the question simply with love for humanity.\u201dLee Wooyeon tried to get up from his seat.\u00a0Inseop held on to him saying it\u2019s not true.\u00a0It was a desperate feeling.\u00a0Strangely, he felt a sense of crisis that he had to convince Lee Wooyeon now.\u201cEverything I say is true.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dA faint smirk crossed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face as he asked that question.\u201cI can.\u201dLee Wooyeon glanced down at Inseop\u2019s fingertips trembling even while he was talking like that.\u201cCan you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to push yourself.\u00a0This is not an emergency like I\u2019d run out of breath.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then I will close my eyes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe said it with great kindness.\u00a0Inseop released the hem of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s robe he was holding.\u00a0His mouth was dry.Even if he tried to sort out how things were going, his brain had stopped functioning a while back.Blood rushed to his heart.\u00a0He could feel the pulse all over his body.Knowing that this was just Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fickle test, he couldn\u2019t help but be heartbroken.\u2018Let\u2019s calm down.\u00a0This is just a test.\u00a0A test to see if what I\u2019m saying is true or not.\u2019\u201cYou won\u2019t do it?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked, slightly opening one of his closed eyes.When Inseop faced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face with his eyes closed right in front of him, he felt his heart, which he had barely calmed down, pound like crazy.There were days when he spent hot nights imagining what it would be like to kiss him.\u00a0There were certainly moments when he blushed alone imagining the touch of his lips.When he gave artificial respiration to Lee Wooyeon, who was rescued from the lake, their lips touched, but it was such an urgent moment, he couldn\u2019t even think of a kiss or the touch of his lips.\u00a0Later, he remembered that scene alone in his head, and his face got a little feverish.However, Inseop also had no memory of the touch.\u00a0And now, a new memory about him was on the verge of being created.Choi Inseop slowly leaned his head forward and bowed his back.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cool breath was felt on the tip of his nose from a distance.He thought he was going to die.\u00a0He was so handsome that it felt unreal.\u00a0That\u2019s what all of this felt like.\u00a0He felt like he was dreaming all day today.He moved his lips a little further forward.\u00a0His whole body trembled.\u00a0It was far enough that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath directly touched her lips.\u00a0A little more, a little more.The tip of his lips barely touched.\u00a0Something touched the tip, it was a slight touch, but that alone was enough to kill Choi Inseop on the spot.\u2018Oh My God.\u00a0If I go on like this, my heart will really\u2026\u2019At that moment, Lee Wooyeon opened his eyes.\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cIt was a joke.\u00a0I can\u2019t even joke with Inseop.\u00a0But I have no hobbies with men, so I can\u2019t go beyond this.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t know that the tip of his lips touched slightly, so he continued playfully.\u201cSorry.\u00a0Inseop doesn\u2019t seem to have any hobbies either, so it was difficult, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0I\u2019ll believe you.\u00a0Can I believe what Inseop is saying?\u00a0Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201dLee Wooyeon gently bent his eyes and smiled broadly.\u00a0This was a really fun situation.However, for Inseop,it felt like cold water was poured on him.\u00a0He felt like he was stripped of his emotions in front of Lee Wooyeon.\u201cMr. Inseop, I\u2019m joking\u2026\u00a0?\u201dLee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop\u2019s face, whose shoulders were shaking.\u201cAre you crying?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you crying now?\u00a0Inseop?\u201dHe wanted to deny that this is not the case, but tears were already dripping down his chin.It was only for a moment at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s casual joke, but he hated himself, who was genuinely excited.\u00a0HE wanted to die.\u00a0It was so shameful.\u201c\u2026\u00a0I will go.\u201dThis time, Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm as he was about to get up.\u00a0 Inseop pushed to shake it off, hitting his fingertips on the sofa and curled up with a silent scream.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201d\u201cSrry.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon quickly grabbed him, lifted him up, and examined his face.\u201cDid you bump your hand?\u00a0Are you okay?\u201d\u201cI will go home.\u201dTears fell nonstop.\u00a0It was a mess.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know what it was now. Whether it was embarrassing to show tears in front of this man again, or whether it was shameful that he pushed his face in, trembling after being deceived by a joke.Choi Inseop just wanted to go home.\u00a0His broken finger hurts, his cut stung, his face was burning up\u2026he hated myselfA few years have passed since then, but he was fed up with his foolishness of doing things without the ability to learn.\u00a0He wanted to quit.\u00a0It was obvious what kind of ending he would have if he stayed with Lee Wooyeon here like this.Incompetent, let alone Lee Wooyeon\u2019s weaknesses, he only cared about him, and discovered a lot of good points, so he\u2019ll fall for him again.\u00a0An idiot, a fool, the world\u2019s biggest fool\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Jennie.\u00a0I\u2019m a bigger fool than I thought.\u2019\u201cIt was a serious joke.\u00a0I didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201dLee Wooyeon raised his hand to Inseop\u2019s face, who was silently crying, and tenderly offered an apology.It was true.It was just a joke he made for fun.\u00a0The other person\u2019s feelings were out of his control in the first place.\u00a0He already knew that what Choi Inseop had said to him was true.\u00a0He just wanted to make fun of him.\u00a0He wanted to make it difficult.He just wanted to see that face that was helpless because of him again.Choi Inseop clenched his lips and tried to hold back the tears, but as soon as the tears formed around his eyes, they flowed down.Lee Wooyeon saw that and thought that he was crying so beautifully.\u00a0As an actor, he worked with many actresses and watched them cry a lot.\u00a0Among them, there were some actresses who were praised for having a crying face more beautiful than a smiling face.However, the appearance of Choi Inseop, who was biting his lips in front of him and silently dripping tears, was far superior to them.\u00a0Normally, he had the impression that his features were a little too thin, but when he saw him crying, he looked strangely pretty.Was he the person who cried with this face in the first place?Lee Wooyeon held Inseop\u2019s chin with his hand and looked at it carefully, thinking about it.To be honest, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to look at his crying face all the time, but it was too pitiful to just watch.\u00a0He broke his finger for him today, so he thought he\u2019d be kind for now.\u201cI will believe what Inseop said is sincere.\u00a0So don\u2019t cry.\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0Choi Inseop was startled and tried to push him away, but he strengthened the hand holding his shoulder.\u00a0Then, he placed his head on Inseop\u2019s shoulder and patted his back with the other hand.\u201cDo not cry.\u00a0Okay?\u00a0I am so sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI was wrong.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201dThe friendly voice vibrating on his back seemed more unrealistic, so Inseop shed tears for a while.\u00a0\u2019Don\u2019t cry, why are you crying like this, I look like a bad guy, I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t joke around anymore, I\u2019m sorry for making you cry\u2019, Lee Wooyeon, who was quietly consoling Inseop suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for telling a crying person this\u2013\u201dFearing that he might say something terrible again, Inseop\u2019s tears that had barely subsided became thick again.\u00a0He wanted to cover his ears if he could.Lee Wooyeon, who had been quiet for a while, opened his mouth.\u201cWould you mind rewriting the contract with me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Inseop saved his life twice, so he had to take responsibility, no, it was three times.Regrets that he should not have saved his life came rushing in like a tide.\u00a0Of course, he knew he would go back and do the same thing over and over again, but just for now.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dWhen Inseop sighed again, Manager Cha looked at him, opened the cap of the bottled water he had bought at the convenience store, and gave it to Inseop.\u201cAre your hands okay?\u00a0When are you going to the hospital again?\u201d\u201cHe said see him in a week.\u00a0There are no major problems, so all I need to do is put the cast on like this.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so glad.\u201dSaying that, manager Cha handed the water to Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting behind him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took the water with both hands and said thank you in a polite voice.He didn\u2019t want to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager even if he died, and he won\u2019t do it ever again, but how could he make a boy with both hands hurt work. He didn\u2019t like Choi Inseop and hated other new managers\u2026\u00a0First of all, he decided he would do it for now, so manager Cha decided to act as the road manager for Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Choi Inseop was doing the same thing as before, except driving and using his body, but adjusting the schedule and taking care of Lee Wooyeon in detail.After promising that he would only be a substitute driver, Manager Cha took the steering wheel.\u00a0In fact, he had been working comfortably for several days, now that he didn\u2019t have to worry about anything other than driving.\u00a0Of course, he also planned to rip off a special bonus from CEO Kim.The manager, who felt happy at the thought of the bonus, hummed and turned on the radio.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was reading the script from behind, raised his head with a slight frown.\u00a0Choi Inseop quickly turned off the radio and shook his head.When reading the script, Lee Wooyeon hated turning on the radio or people talking to him.\u00a0The reason was that it would interfere with his concentration.\u00a0Why would manager Cha, who is not aware of the situation, not even notice and turn on the radio again?As the pounding dance music played, the manager hummed and started driving the car.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon glanced at the back of the head of the manager from behind, but didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cI\u2026\u00a0Can I play the CD I brought?\u201dInseop asked cautiously.\u201cYea.\u00a0Do what you want.\u201dInseop opened the glove box on the dashboard, took out a CD, and played music.\u00a0It was a selection of songs that Lee Wooyeon liked and listened to.\u00a0As quiet music played in the van, manager Cha muttered.\u201cWhen I\u2019m driving, I don\u2019t feel like driving when I hear a song like this.\u00a0Mr. Inseop has a very special taste.\u00a0Why does a man listen to this song?\u201dChoi Inseop smiled awkwardly and looked at Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting in the back seat.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t pay attention to them and only read the script, thinking that he should ignore Cha.\u00a0When Inseop and him were alone in the van, it was a completely different atmosphere.\u00a0It seemed that CEO Kim\u2019s statement that the compatibility between Manager Cha and Lee Wooyeon was secretly inconsistent was true.\u201cBy the way, how did the shooting of the horse riding scene go?\u00a0Are you filming again?\u00a0Is it time to shoot again?\u201d\u201cThey will edit it appropriately and export it. Since I did fall down.\u00a0I think the reality would be even better.\u201dLee Wooyeon handed over the script and answered indifferently.\u00a0After that, he received a call from the director saying that the horse that he rode on broke his leg and had to be euthanized in the end, and Lee Wooyeon had a hard time swallowing the words \u201cGood for him\u201d when he heard it.\u00a0Instead he responded appropriately, saying, \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 and the director apologized, saying that the situation seemed a little strange from the beginning.At that time, for a moment, Lee Wooyeon covered the microphone of the cell phone with his hand and asked CEO Kim if he could sue the people who managed it.\u00a0If that happened, it would make him look bad, so CEO Kim told him to just move on.\u00a0Even after hanging up on the phone, Lee Wooyeon thought it would be good to sue, which made CEO Kim\u2019s insides burn.Today\u2019s dinner was a meeting prepared by the director for Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0It was meant to apologize to Lee Wooyeon, who was injured, and to get together and promote the drama that was airing soon.\u00a0A person who knew that he should be sorry would give him a break for even an hour, but the director didn\u2019t seem to care, Lee Wooyeon muttered as he hung up the phone.CEO Kim shivered in cold sweat as he felt that the frequency of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s dirty personality was increasing.\u00a0Looking at Lee Wooyeon these days, it felt like climbing an active volcano where magma was boiling, and he confessed to the manager in tears at a drinking party.\u201cThat means\u2026 Would it be okay?\u201dChoi Inseop, who was not aware of this situation, asked cautiously.\u00a0When the reins were cut and Lee Wooyeon stumbled sideways and fell, it was Inseop who lost his balance and almost rolled on the floor.Manager Cha said, \u2018Uh, you didn\u2019t know?\u2019and he answered Inseop\u2019s question with a question.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dead.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was behind him, said in a very light tone, so Inseop was confused for a moment whether he had chosen the wrong word and used it.\u201c\u2026\u00a0He\u2019s dead?\u201d\u201cYea, that\u2019s right, he broke his leg.\u00a0Horses with broken legs are usually euthanized.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u00a0What is that!\u00a0You can fix it.\u00a0Can\u2019t you just use a cast?\u201dInseop exclaimed.It was hard to believe that the horse with the name of Jennie, who he patted on the shoulder to give strength, died in vain.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even want to believe it.\u201cA horse\u2019s life is over if they hurt their leg.\u00a0Because they can\u2019t lie down like a human.\u00a0They say that a secondary infection occurs while lying down, and then it becomes even more painful.\u201d\u201cBut why euthanized?\u201dHe was almost crying.\u00a0Inseop exclaimed, turning his body completely to the side, the veins in his neck was pulsating.\u201cWhy is that?\u00a0What did he do wrong, he just fell.\u00a0He made a mistake.\u00a0People make mistakes too\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dLee Wooyeon cut off Inseop\u2019s words.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better or not.\u00a0If you take care of him, he might be able to live!\u201dInseop was so erratic that he said he would take care of him if he was right in front of him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon reached out from behind and tapped Inseop\u2019s cheek.\u00a0Inseop was startled by the cold touch of his fingertips and turned pale.\u201cIt is better to accept the inevitable problems.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is unavoidable.\u00a0It\u2019s not something we can choose or influence.\u201dThere was no emotion in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s calm tone.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t his usual way of smiling and provoking people, nor was it an outward tone of being polite and friendly.Manager Cha looked at Lee Wooyeon from the rearview mirror, thinking, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u00a0When their eyes met in the mirror, Lee Wooyeon frowned playfully.\u2018\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I hate him too.\u2019The manager shuddered as if he saw something he shouldn\u2019t see and turned the steering wheel.\u201cThen have a drink until late today.\u00a0Will I be waiting nearby?\u201dNoticing that Inseop was exhausted from talking about horses, manager Cha asked in a bright voice on purpose.\u201cManager, go home.\u00a0I will drive.\u201dInseop didn\u2019t feel like drinking.\u201cHey.\u00a0That\u2019s too much.\u00a0Inseop, have a nice drink today too.\u00a0Seeing that the director deliberately asked Inseop to come, he\u2019ll buy you drinks.\u00a0Ah, I want to have free drinks too.\u201dWhen he thought of free alcohol, manager Cha unknowingly smacked his lips.\u201cGo instead of me.\u00a0I will wait in the car.\u201dWhen Inseop said that seriously, Manager Cha shook his head, saying it was fine.\u00a0Of course, it would be false to say that Inseop\u2019s proposal was not appealing, but he wasn\u2019t fussy enough to tell whether he was allowed to join or not.The reason why one manager, Choi Inseop, was invited to this place today was because he broke his finger in an accident that day.\u00a0Probably, it was clear that only a few big people among the actors and staff were invited to today\u2019s meeting.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0After all, there would be only noble actors.\u00a0Besides, the director called you, of course you\u2026\u201dWhile talking, Manager Cha heard the ringing of his cell phone and nodded to Inseop.\u201cLook at my cell phone.\u00a0The only person to call at this time is CEO Kim.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Who is the \u2018devil\u2019s daughter\u2019?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dManager Cha almost stopped the car in the middle of the road.\u00a0He swallowed his saliva and gestured to Inseop.\u201cPut it away, put the phone away.\u00a0Ex-wife.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTurn off the phone.\u201dInseop remembered hearing that Mr. Cha\u2019s divorced ex-wife was CEO Kim\u2019s ex-wife.\u00a0Hasn\u2019t it been cleared up yet?When Inseop grabbed the cell phone and looked around not knowing what to do, Lee Wooyeon reached out and snatched the phone.\u201cI\u2019ll put it behind.\u00a0Uh, sorry.\u00a0I picked it up.\u201dAnyone could tell that it was intentional, disguised as a mistake.\u00a0From the cell phone, a woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cHello, hello,\u201d echoed inside the car.\u00a0Manager Cha accepted the phone, crying.\u201cHello.\u00a0Uh\u2026\u00a0 uh\u2026 I\u2019m working.\u00a0What?\u00a0No, why would I?\u00a0Why would I go there and do that?\u00a0What?\u00a0What?\u201dThe voice on the phone became increasingly harsh.\u00a0Manager Cha shouted a few more times, \u201cWhy would I go there?\u201d, but to no avail.\u00a0After finishing the call, all the worries of the world fell on his forehead.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s going on?\u201dWhen Choi Inseop asked carefully, manager Cha muttered with a depressed face.\u201c\u2026\u00a0You, don\u2019t get a divorce later, no, don\u2019t get married at all.\u00a0Just live alone\u00a0Because that\u2019s better.\u201dManager Cha apologized for saying that and continued.\u201cI have a place I need to go to today, so when I go, call a chauffeur.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, just bear it for today.\u201dWhen manager Cha looked at Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting behind him, he sent an OK sign with his hand.\u00a0Manager Cha parked in the parking lot of a bar in Nonhyeon-dong, where he had an appointment today, and handed the car key to Inseop.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to call a Chauffeur, take a taxi.\u00a0Understand?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Thanks for taking me.\u201dInseop greeted manager Cha.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon also made a small bow from behind.\u00a0Manager Cha could clearly see the sneer that flashed across his eyes.Son of a bitch.When Choi Inseop disappeared into the building first, manager Cha quietly grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe phone call.\u201dLee Wooyeon said, \u201cAh,\u201d and smiled.\u00a0If one didn\u2019t know what he was like inside, he was really handsome, and he had a beautiful face that made people admire him.\u201cI mean, I hate that dance music.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGoodbye.\u201dLee Wooyeon greeted him, who was confused, and entered the building entrance.\u00a0Manager Cha, who was left alone, stood still, unable to speak, and then sighed.\u00a0As he walked out to the main road to catch a taxi, he decided that he should advise Inseop to think twice before signing the contract.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was mentioned that these days they would go back and forth to Seoul and take a nap, but later on, there would come a day when they would barely have time to be taking a shower at a nearby motel.In addition, after it aired, depending on the reaction of the viewers, the cast of the film could be changed.\u00a0Now, according to the original, Kang Youngmo\u2019s filming ratio is slightly higher, but it was not difficult to predict that the game would change once it was aired.\u00a0The character Lee Wooyeon read and reinterpreted the script was attractive enough to surpass the original, so everyone now knows that the original author was very happy after coming to the set and watching it once.It would not be an exaggeration to say that Lee Wooyeon was the busiest among the actors currently filming, so the filming schedule was almost in line with his schedule.\u00a0Kang Youngmo, who did not like Lee Wooyeon\u2019s every move, was very annoyed that he had to move according to his schedule.\u201cThis week, I will be able to focus on filming because something else has been completed.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u00a0We just have to hope that such strange accidents don\u2019t happen again.\u201dKang Youngmo asked where the bathroom was to the camera director who was sitting next to him.\u00a0Everyone breathed a sigh of relief knowing that it was going to end there.\u201cLee Wooyeon is very lucky.\u201dAs they left the room, Kang Youngmo muttered to himself and smiled at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Even Inseop, who couldn\u2019t read between lines, knew at once that it was a sarcastic statement.\u00a0People on the left looked at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s complexion, worried that he might feel bad.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon was just sitting there with a detached face like a person who wasn\u2019t bothered by such things.\u00a0Everyone really admired his wonderful personality.\u00a0It could not be compared to Kang Youngmo, who only had good acting skills but a bad personality\u201cI was going to park my car over there, but another car parked in front of me, so\u2026\u201dAt that time, Kang Youngmo\u2019s manager, Yoon Cheoljin, who came into the room, confirmed that Kang Youngmo was not in the room and shut his mouth.\u00a0The camera director beckoned him to sit, but he found Lee Wooyeon and Inseop right in front of him and stiffened his expression awkwardly.\u201cWhere is Teacher Kang?\u201d\u201cHe went to the bathroom.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dAs soon as Yoon Cheoljin left, the people sitting inside were arguing.\u201cHe even tells his manager to address him as teacher.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t tell by his personality. He tells everyone to call him a teacher. If you want to hear the name teacher so badly, you can be a school teacher, why be an actor.\u201d\u201cWhat will the students do, then?\u201dEveryone said, \u201cWoah,\u201d and burst into laughter.\u00a0Groups with public enemies were easy to assemble.\u00a0Everyone burst into anger while Kang Youngmo went to the bathroom.\u00a0When it comes to the staff and other actors, it\u2019s usually double assault and pointing fingers, so they couldn\u2019t help but talk behind his back.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll go to the bathroom.\u201dNo one would pay any attention to him, but he felt he had to say that, so Inseop quietly muttered and stood up from his seat.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon jokes, \u201cWould you like to go with me?\u201d, the people nearby laughed, saying, \u201cMr. Inseop must be happy.\u201dChoi Inseop quickly closed the door and went out, wondering what would happen if Lee Wooyeon really followed him.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Huu\u2026\u00a0.\u201dIt was frustrating.\u00a0He was not familiar with Korea\u2019s drinking culture, and Lee Wooyeon next to him, with Kang Youngmo in the next seat, was like a cushion of thorns.\u00a0Regrets came flooding back to him as he thought that he should have just stayed in the car.Wanting to get some fresh air, Inseop walked to the terrace connected to the store.\u00a0The moment he grabbed the handle and opened the door, he heard a familiar voice.\u201cWhat should I do now?\u201dIt was Yoon Cheoljin, Kang Youngmo\u2019s manager.\u00a0Inseop tried to avoid him, wondering if he was going to make a phone call.\u00a0But before he could leave, Kang Youngmo\u2019s annoyed voice could be heard.\u201cWhat do you mean what should I do?\u00a0You fucking bastard.\u00a0Even though you\u2019re not that old, do you still have to taste it to see which one is poop, and which one is the soybean paste?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t figure out why the two people who should be in the bathroom were here.\u00a0It was a common sight to see Kang Youngmo grabbing the manager like a mouse.\u00a0But the next words he heard held Choi Inseop in his place.\u201cStill, I just feel a little bit like that.\u00a0I thought it would just end up falling over.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager broke his finger and said that Lee Wooyeon was also injured\u2026\u201dInseop grabbed the doorknob and listened to the conversation between the two.\u201cThat\u2019s how bad luck those bastards are.\u00a0Why do you care?\u00a0Stop crying.\u201d\u201cThat horse, I feel a bit sorry for it being euthanized\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you stupid?\u00a0What\u2019s the big deal for a horse to die?\u00a0There\u2019s no evidence of that drug anyway.\u00a0There is no evidence, what can they do?\u201dWhen Choi Inseop recalled the appearance of Yoon Cheoljin, who was rushing out of the stable that day, his blood went cold.\u00a0It was clear that Kang Youngmo had instructed the manager to do something about the horse.\u00a0Inseop pushed the door handle he was holding with all his might.\u201cI need to talk to you for a moment.\u201dWhen Inseop suddenly appeared, both of them looked shocked.\u00a0When Yoon Cheoljin did not know what to do, Kang Youngmo beckoned him to leave.\u00a0Rather than make even the slightest mistake, he thought that he would deal with the young manager on his own.\u00a0Yoon Cheoljin left and only two people were left on the terrace.\u201cI\u2019m busy, so I don\u2019t know what you want to talk about, but finish it quickly.\u201dKang Youngmo took a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it.\u00a0Cigarette smoke was deliberately blown out in front of Inseop.\u00a0Choi Inseop calmly made up his mind.\u201cI happened to overhear the conversation the two of you had, and I have a question.\u201d\u201cDid you hear that by chance?\u00a0Aren\u2019t you eavesdropping like a rat?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on purpose, but I apologize first.\u201dHis fingertips were cold.\u00a0Inseop clenched and opened his fist behind his back and looked at Kang Youngmo clearly.\u201cSo what do you want to say?\u201d\u201cI would like to know what medicine you gave Jennie or that horse earlier.\u201d\u201cHorse?\u00a0Ah, that horse.\u00a0It was originally this.\u201dKang Youngmo also pointed a finger near the temple and turned it round and round.\u201cNo.\u00a0When I saw it, it was fine.\u00a0Obviously, you said that you gave the horse some kind of medicine.\u00a0Because of that drug, the horse was strange that day\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop was unable to speak.\u00a0A burning pain spread across his cheeks along with the sound of a slap.\u201cWhat are you saying now?\u00a0Did I drug the horse?\u201d\u201cThe two of you are clearly\u2026\u201dThis time, he was beaten harder than before.\u00a0He could feel the bitter taste of blood in his mouth.\u00a0However, Inseop was not afraid of Kang Youngmo.\u00a0He was just angry.\u201cConversation?\u00a0What conversation?\u00a0I never had any.\u00a0Do you have any evidence?\u201d\u201cObviously I heard it!\u201dHe opened his eyes wide and answered, but what came back was Kang Youngmo\u2019s punches.\u00a0Inseop, who was hit in the vicinity of his face, collapsed on the spot along with the table on the terrace.\u201cWhat are you listening to?\u00a0Do you have any evidence?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn it, there\u2019s no proof, but you\u2019re the only one saying that to me right now?\u00a0Are you out of your mind\u00a0Are you going to make me unable to step on the floor at all?\u201dThe production in which Kang Youngmo was a member of was one of the top three entertainment companies in Korea.\u00a0His uncle was the president of the company, so no matter how dirty his personality was, he couldn\u2019t treat him badly.\u00a0Even CEO Kim advised Lee Wooyeon not to get involved with Kang Youngmo if possible.Choi Inseop raised his head and looked at Kang Youngmo.\u201cWhere are your eyes looking?\u201d\u201cThe reins were cut that day.\u00a0It\u2019s like giving the horse some weird medicine.\u00a0It must have been no coincidence.\u201dKang Youngmo tilted his shoulders back and burst out laughing out loud.\u201cHahaha.\u00a0It\u2019s funny\u00a0Do you know what kind of detective you are?\u00a0You seem to be misunderstanding something.\u201dKang Youngmo once again slapped Inseop\u2019s cheek with his palm and pressed the cigarette he was holding onto his cast to put it out.\u201cYou\u2019ll get seriously injured when you run your mouth off without any evidence.\u00a0Do you know that only you get hurt?\u00a0Even Lee Wooyeon is hurt, so don\u2019t go out in vain.\u201dHe tapped the tip of Inseop\u2019s chin with his shoe and spit.\u00a0The door to the terrace opened and the sound of his shoes gradually faded away.Choi Inseop got up and shook off his clothes.\u00a0As he fell, he unknowingly touched the floor with his injured hand, causing his fingers to tingle.\u00a0He wiped his nosebleed with the hem of his sleeve.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0Ugh.\u201dHe quickly tilted his head back, and then he bowed forward, remembering Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words that if he tilted back, the blood would flow into his throat and it would be rather bad.\u00a0He was holding his nose with his hand, and blood dripped down between his fingers.Seeing the blood falling on the floor, Inseop thought that he did not know what he was doing after coming to Korea.\u00a0One of his hands was torn, a finger was broken, and his nose was bleeding from being beaten.\u00a0In the midst of this, he was thinking of the voice of Lee Wooyeon, who was worried about him\u2026\u201cI feel so stupid\u2026\u201dHe was in tears at how stupid he was.He was going to calmly ask Kang Youngmo what he did to the horse, but he couldn\u2019t even express his intentions properly.\u00a0If he knew his usual temper, he would have recorded the conversation earlier\u2026A human like him would never be able to take advantage of someone\u2019s weakness or threaten them even for the rest of their lives.Inseop remembered the gray-haired horse he had seen that evening.\u00a0\u2019I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Jennie.\u00a0I\u2019m a fool, so I can\u2019t even reveal your unfortunate death.\u2019It happened again this time.Tears dripped down to his shoes.Inseop stood like that for a while, and then came out of the terrace when the nosebleed stopped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

you come to Korea after studying in the US?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0That\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cWhy did you come to Korea?\u201dPutting the glass to his lips, Lee Wooyeon smiled softly without saying a word.His father, who could not keep his son in a mental hospital because of his social status, asked a relative to send him to Korea under the pretext of recuperation.\u00a0According to his father, people like him needed to suffer a little to come to their senses.Lee Wooyeon, who was living a life close to confinement in a remote mountainous area where it was surprising how electricity was available, knocked down the manager who was guarding the hut and came to Seoul.\u00a0And he immediately went to an entertainment company and asked if he could become an actor.That was the fucking secret story that brought Lee Wooyeon to where he is today.\u201cRumor says that you came to Korea against your parents will for acting because you came from a very prestigious family, is that right?\u201dThat\u2019s right.\u00a0He was kicked out.\u00a0He got kicked out because he was crazy.\u00a0He almost went to jail for doing something crazy.\u00a0Of course, as they said, because of his prestigious family, he was put in a mental hospital with a good name, not a prison but a sanatorium.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled kindly and did not say those words out loud.That day was an accident.\u00a0An accident that occurred due to a moment of carelessness in which the person he had been suppressing showed up and his real self personality was revealed.\u00a0It started with the opponent who was waving bananas while mocking him, calling him names before the match and deliberately kicking his shin during the match.\u00a0It was a particularly bad day, and the match didn\u2019t go as well as he had hoped, but the fire was ignited.\u00a0After the match, he went to the opposing team\u2019s locker room and trampled on the player until he collapsed.\u00a0Hearing this, one might think it was a common fight between people of the same age, but if they looked closely, the hairs on their body would stand in fright.The opposing player who provoked him was so injured that he could not use one of his hands, and his cornea was almost peeled off, eventually losing his sight.\u00a0It was such a tragic situation that it was considered a miracle to be alive.\u00a0Not only that, the opposing team player and the same team player who stopped him were also injured.\u00a0Among them, there were several students who were injured to the point that they could not play at all.\u00a0Everyone said he was going to jail, but he was released into a mental asylum.\u00a0At that time, Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t help but admit that money could really solve anything.\u00a0Of course, his illness could not be solved even with money in the end.After a series of tests, he was diagnosed with a lifelong quarantine.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon quietly remembered the face of his mother, who calmly listened to the doctor\u2019s explanation that his innate temperament could not be changed.As usual, he read various emotions from his mother\u2019s eyes.Shame and anger, fear and sorrow, and despair.Isn\u2019t it sad when a person is sick?\u00a0He really doesn\u2019t know why he couldn\u2019t just kill a living thing?\u00a0 \u2018Can\u2019t you really understand why you shouldn\u2019t hurt people?\u2019\u00a0His mother held her son\u2019s hands and asked earnestly several times.\u00a0At that time, he had stopped pretending to be kind, so he honestly smiled and told the truth.\u2018I\u2019m not sad.\u00a0I don\u2019t really know what sadness is.\u00a0Why not kill it?\u00a0It\u2019s terribly annoying.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter if you die or not.\u00a0Hahaha.\u00a0What if I get a little hurt?\u00a0You get hurt after a car accident, it\u2019s similar.\u00a0Yes, I\u2019m serious.\u00a0Shit, what can I say?\u00a0I was born like this.\u00a0Let\u2019s accept what we can\u2019t help.\u2019With a beautiful smile on her son\u2019s face, saying that, the mother let go of the ugly thing.\u00a0After the visit, the mother returned home that day and attempted suicide.\u00a0She couldn\u2019t accept the fact that her son wasn\u2019t a sick patient, but that he was born intact and that the God she loved so much gave her such a monster.Of course, it was a brief show as she had her wrists cut in the bathtub of a house full of employees.\u00a0But for his father, even the brief show was a huge event.\u00a0When his father, who had appeared dazed for a few days, talked about it for a long time, he did not show any particular reaction.He wasn\u2019t really worried because he thought that if she really wanted to die anyway, she wouldn\u2019t have chosen that way.\u00a0He just thought about it for a moment, then said that it would be difficult for her to play tennis for a while.Upon hearing his words, his father jumped up from his seat and left.\u00a0That was the last time.\u00a0After a while he was expelled to Korea.\u201cReally?\u00a0Did you come to Korea to act?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dAs if she had accepted Lee Wooyeon\u2019s silence as a positive, she screamed while blinking her lashes covered with mascara.\u201cI think the rumors are true.\u00a0Totally cool.\u201dThe actress sitting next to Lee Wooyeon was one of the famous idol members, and the so-called agency put her in a small role in the drama.\u00a0Without noticing, she clung to Lee Wooyeon and asked about it, so no one thought of stopping her.\u00a0He thought it was rude, but in fact, everyone was curious about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s past.\u201cAre there any rumors?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked with a smile as if surprised.\u201cOf course.\u00a0Other than that, what was it?\u00a0Oh right.\u00a0Wooyeon, I heard that your family is some kind of aristocratic family.\u00a0Hey, this is a lie.\u00a0Where are the nobles in America?\u201dTo be precise, his grandfather was of British aristocratic descent.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon could not be regarded as belonging to that family because he was a son brought by his mother when she remarried.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled enthusiastically.\u201cLee Wooyeon Oppa, don\u2019t you have a girlfriend?\u201dShe glanced at the people around her and grabbed his arm and asked in a charming way.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pretended to check his cell phone by pulling his hand out.There was a text message.\u00a0The sender was his manager.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was about to go out to check on Inseop, who said he was going to the bathroom, but didn\u2019t come back.A smile fell on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips as he checked the text.\u201cOh, Wooyeon oppa.\u00a0Where are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go out for a while.\u201dLee Wooyeon politely apologized to the people around him and stood up.When Inseop saw his face while washing his face in the bathroom, he was terribly surprised.\u00a0His lips were torn and his cheeks were swollen red, so no matter how much he looked at it, it was like advertising that someone had hit him.Unable to return to his seat, he sent a text message to Lee Wooyeon saying he would wait in the car.\u00a0He turned on the music in the car and sat back with the seat back.Tears flowed down his cheeks as he remembered the two Jennies who would no longer exist in the world.\u00a0Not one of them, he could protect.\u00a0He didn\u2019t get any help.\u00a0Even now, he ran to the drinking party and questioned Kang Youngmo about the horse medicine!\u00a0He must have been the one who broke the reins!\u00a0That person was a bad guy!\u00a0He was the bad guy!\u00a0He wanted to shout.\u00a0But he had no evidence.\u00a0For a short period of time, he was able to feel the way this world was going to make his bones ache.Now, if Inseop said that he was beaten by Kang Youngmo, his relationship with Lee Wooyeon would become even more awkward, and the filming of the drama may be disrupted.\u00a0Then, as a matter of fact, Inseop would be fired.It wasn;t unfair to get fired.\u00a0In the end, he just hated his own incompetence, because he had no choice but to step back without being able to solve anything.\u00a0What kind of\u00a0 a grown man was he to lock himself in the car and cry out.Should he go away?\u00a0Should he go to America?\u00a0Can\u2019t he just throw it all away and go to America, take care of Jennie\u2019s grave for the rest of his life, and live with a heart of atonement?\u201cJennie\u2026.\u201dInseop closed his eyes as he called out a name from which there was no answer.\u00a0Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0I miss you, my one and only friend.Then someone knocked on the car glass.\u00a0Inseop was startled and got up from his seat and lowered the glass of the car.\u201cI\u2019ll take the car out soon\u2026\u201dHe said that as he had double-parked because there was no parking space, but the person looking at him from outside the car was unexpected.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201c\u2026I am tired.\u201dChoi Inseop thought it was fortunate that the lights in the car were not on.\u00a0He won\u2019t be able to see the scars on his face in the dark lighting in the parking lot.\u201cOkay.\u00a0I haven\u2019t been able to sleep at all these days.\u00a0I also want to sleep next to you if possible.\u201dSeeing Lee Wooyeon smiling softly, Inseop breathed a sigh of relief inwardly.\u00a0But the words that followed made his heart sink an inch or so.\u201cBut who did that?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYour face.\u201d\u201cI fell.\u201dLee Wooyeon reached out to the inside of the car glass.\u00a0The white hand approaching from the darkness was terrifying.\u00a0Inseop unconsciously tried to pull back, but his chin was caught.Lee Wooyeon, who was looking at his face, as if examining, muttered to himself.\u201cCan you fall and get hurt like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWho hit you?\u201dChoi Inseop hesitated for a moment whether he should confess everything that happened with Kang Youngmo.\u00a0But he kept his mouth shut and shook his head.\u201cI fell.\u00a0This is what happened when I slipped down the stairs.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s cheek with the other hand.\u00a0The feeling of the cold palms made Inseop\u2019s heart warm and his eyes widened.Lee Wooyeon, who always had a smiling face, opened his eyes slender and spoke in a cold voice.\u201cIt\u2019s annoying for you to keep getting hurt.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant.\u201dChoi Inseop didn\u2019t know what to answer, so he stuttered, as if he was sorry, and apologized.\u201cIf you know you\u2019re sorry, then be careful.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGo home for today.\u00a0I can take a taxi and go back.\u00a0You tell Manager Cha about the car.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes softened.\u201cGo home.\u201dIt was a voice so resolute that anyone would understand that it was a command, not a request.\u00a0Choi Inseop had no choice but to nod his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Okay?\u201d\u201cI have to go now.\u00a0I\u2019ll call you back tomorrow.\u00a0Love you.\u201dInseop saidr and hung up the phone quickly.\u00a0It was because he thought that if they had talked a little more, he would cry and confide in everything that had happened so far.No.\u00a0He had to make up his mind.\u00a0For now, he decided to go home, take a warm shower, water Kate and read his favorite book.\u00a0Then he will feel much better.\u201cGreat.\u00a0It will be fine.\u201dWiping the tears with his palm, Inseop put his phone in his pocket.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dHe realized he had brought the van\u2019s keys.\u00a0Tomorrow Manager Cha would need the key to bring the van.\u00a0He should have left it at the parking lot, but he just brought it with him because he wasn\u2019t in his right mind.Choi Inseop got up from his seat and walked towards the entrance again.\u00a0Looking back the way he had come, he thought about what to do next.According to the plan, after about a month and a half, he would be fired and he would have to go to the United States with Lee Wooyeon\u2019s corruption, and there he had to write a letter to a newspaper.\u00a0It started with the intention of ending everything within that time frame, even buying the plane ticket to the United States.However, if he stayed like this, he may have to sign a three-year contract with Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He absolutely wanted to avoid that.\u00a0He didn\u2019t have the confidence to stand by Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side for such a long time.But maybe that was a good thing?\u00a0If he went back home like this, he didn\u2019t have to face Jennie.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even have the confidence to be by Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side.\u00a0He missed his family, he wanted to lean on someone, and his heart was getting weaker.\u201cShall I just go\u2026\u00a0\u201dPassing through the train ticket gates, Inseop tried to mumble a little.After hearing his mother\u2019s voice, his desire to go to America grew stronger.\u00a0Inseop recalled the evidence he had about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s complicated relationship with women.\u00a0If he gave it to the newspaper, it would be noisy for a while.\u00a0However, he will not be able to take Lee Wooyeon off the spot.\u00a0Unlike female celebrities, the broadcasting industry is generous with male celebrities.\u00a0If Lee Wooyeon held a press conference and announced that there was a misunderstanding and that they were just close friends, it would be noisy for a while, but in the end it would pass without any major problems.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was not only living on his image, but also because he was an actor with a name for his talent.Choi Inseop let out a small sigh.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who he watched from the side, was a perfect actor.\u00a0It may hurt the image of the man named Lee Wooyeon, who was serious and gentle, but in the end, he had to admit that he would not be able to bring down the actor Lee Wooyeon.In a month and a half, won\u2019t something big happen to prove that Lee Wooyeon was an asshole in reality?\u201cWinning the lottery is more likely.\u201dChoi Inseop muttered and walked out.\u00a0He remembered that CEO Kim said as if complaining that it would be difficult to find a person with such an image as Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was also human, so he may make mistakes in life, but the probability that it will happen within a month and a half was close to zero, which was a problem.\u201cI should have gone home.\u201dInseop took out his cell phone and checked the time.\u00a0He heard that today\u2019s dinner party would end early because there was a filming going on tomorrow morning.\u00a0After eating and drinking in moderation, it was an atmosphere of destruction.\u00a0In fact, that\u2019s why he said he would stay until the end, but Lee Wooyeon asked him to return with a scary face, so he had no choice but to get out of the car.He hoped everyone went back after it was over.\u00a0Because he didn\u2019t want to run into Kang Youngmo and his manager today.\u00a0He would go to the filming set tomorrow and see his face, but he didn\u2019t want to see him today.Hoping that today\u2019s meeting was over, Inseop walked down the street.The place where they had an appointment today was in a quiet place far away from the downtown area, so the more he walked, the fewer people there were.\u201cIt was like this.\u201dChoi Inseop looked around.\u00a0It was dark and there were hardly any signs that were lit, so it was harder than he thought to find the way.\u00a0Apparently there was a flower shop and a coffee shop side by side here\u00a0\u2026As he looked back on the way he had just returned, he looked around eagerly.\u00a0Then a silver Bentley came into his line of sight.\u00a0He looked at the license plate to see if it was Kang Youngmo\u2019s car.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dHe frowned at the thought that Kang Youngmo could be nearby.\u00a0It was the first time in his short life that he had such a bad feeling.\u00a0Rather, if he were to uncover the bad things about Kang Youngmo and let the world know, he would be able to gather a lot of evidence in less than a week, let alone three months.Inseop wanted to see if Kang Youngmo was in the car, so he deliberately turned to the inside of the alley instead of that road.\u00a0If he went this way, he would have to walk for a while, but he thought it would be better than meeting Kang Youngmo in a deserted place.He was avoiding it because Kang Youngmo was a piece of shit, not because he was afraid.\u201cKang Youngmo is a piece of shit.\u201dAfter getting that out of his mouth, he felt a little refreshed inside.\u00a0Choi Inseop walked down the street, saying shit, shit, shit a few more times.\u00a0It made him feel strangely better when he was pouring out such vulgar words alone in a street where no one was there.\u00a0He realized this was why people cursed.\u201cA bad guy.\u00a0Kang Youngmo is like shit\u2026\u201dInseop, who was pulling his lips together to say \u201cBastard\u201d, heard a strange sound.\u00a0It sounded like an animal\u2019s cry, so Inseop stopped and listened.\u00a0He thought that if there was an animal that was injured somewhere, he should save it and take it to the hospital.\u00a0However, even after standing still for a long time, the cry of the animal was no longer heard.\u201cDid I hear wrong?\u201dWhen Inseop, who had tilted his head, tried to move again, he heard a dull sound of something breaking.\u00a0Then, a shriek was heard.It wasn\u2019t the cry of an animal, it was the sound of a human moaning.\u00a0Realizing this, he felt goosebumps rising up his spine.What the hell was this? Was someone being robbed?\u00a0Does he really need to call 119 saying someone was injured somewhere?\u00a0Or 112?\u00a0But where was the person?\u00a0Should he call the police first?Inseop looked for his cell phone.\u00a0After finding the injured person, he took out his cell phone and looked around so he could call the police at any time.\u00a0The first thing was to determine where the sound was coming from.Then he saw someone coming out of the gap between the buildings.\u00a0The man threw something he was holding to the floor.\u00a0It was a wallet.That was the robber.\u00a0He was watching the robber now.Inseop hid behind the car without realizing it. He thought he should take a picture of the criminal, so he picked up the phone with trembling hands.\u00a0It is so helpful that when he took pictures with his phone to secretly take pictures of Lee Wooyeon, he modified it so that there is no flash and no sound\u2026\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop, who was taking a picture of the man with his cell phone, froze on the spot.\u00a0The moment the man walked out of the shade of the building, his face was revealed under the moonlight.Lee Wooyeon, who had a sober expression that he would not normally have, raised the tip of his lips and smiled with satisfaction.\u00a0He looked so scary.\u00a0Unlike his eyes, which did not contain any emotion, he was smiling to the fullest, and the appearance of his white teeth exposed in the dark seemed far beyond that of a human being.Inseop\u2019s whole body trembled.\u00a0The man in front of him didn\u2019t seem like the Lee Wooyeon he knew.\u00a0Not knowing what just happened, Inseop hid behind the car and watched Lee Wooyeon nervously.After looking around for a while, Lee Wooyeon walked to the end of the alley with a predator-like expression after a satisfying meal.\u00a0Inseop was unable to move from his seat until the sound of the footsteps disappeared.After confirming that Lee Wooyeon had completely disappeared, Inseop carefully walked out from behind the car.\u00a0Also on the floor was a wallet.\u00a0With his cuffs covering his fingers, Inseop slowly picked up his wallet.He may have heard it wrong.\u00a0It may be that Lee Wooyeon accidentally dropped his wallet\u2026\u00a0Of course, Lee Wooyeon used a black leather wallet instead of a brown wallet.\u00a0He might have a wallet he didn\u2019t know and threw it away when he got tired of it.\u00a0All sorts of possibilities popped into his mind.\u00a0Inseop did not know whose wallet he wanted this to be.\u00a0He just opened the wallet with his trembling hands.\u00a0It also contained an ID.\u00a0He took out the ID.It was a familiar face.\u201cUghh\u2026\u201dA painful moan echoed from the alley.\u00a0Choi Inseop could tell who the man lying in the space where one person could barely pass between the buildings was without looking at his face.\u201cKang Young\u2026\u201dBefore he could even call his name, Inseop realized what kind of scene he was getting into.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t believe it either.\u00a0The bitter wind hitting his face brought him back to reality, but even exhaling felt unrealistic.His fingertip touched the cold screen of his cell phone.Choi Inseop held Lee Wooyeon\u2019s weaknessThe warm sunlight streamed through the window like honey.\u00a0Peter, who was having a drowsy morning, laughed as he heard the sound of someone stomping up the stairs.\u00a0Before the smile on his lips faded, Jennie swung the door open with excitement.\u201cPeter!\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t even knock?\u201d\u201cWhat is a knock between us?\u00a0Now that\u2019s not the problem!\u00a0There are some really cool things going on.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dPeter asked, getting up from his bed.\u00a0Yesterday, he had a fever at night and couldn\u2019t sleep for a long time, but hearing Jennie\u2019s pleasant voice made him feel better.\u201cVoila.\u201dShe pulled a letter out of her pocket.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cA reply from the prince.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you believe it?\u00a0ha ha ha\u00a0I really doubted my eyes when I saw this in my locker.\u201dHer eyes lit up as she waved the off-white envelope.\u00a0Peter looked at the letter Jennie was holding with a blank expression.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cWell.\u00a0Where should we read?\u201dAs she sat down by the bed, she coughed in vain.\u00a0Peter asked in amazement.\u201cDid you not open it?\u201d\u201cHuh.\u00a0I didn\u2019t open it and waited to see it with you.\u00a0I was going to come yesterday, but you said you were not feeling well, so I waited.\u00a0I almost died!\u00a0Me!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s bad, it\u2019s bad.\u201dPeter pointed to the desk and continued.\u201cThe envelope-opening knife is in the drawer over there\u2026you ripped it off by hand.\u201dJennie answered, tearing off the seam of the envelope with her hand.\u201cI used up all the patience I had right now as I climbed these stairs.\u00a0Come on, let\u2019s read it.\u201dJennie opened it and read the letters on the paper.\u201cI read the letter you wrote carefully.\u00a0It was the first time such a special letter had been written.\u00a0You were the first person to think of me that way.\u00a0I\u2019ll wait for your next letter.\u00a0Your Philip.\u201dThe letter was very short.\u00a0After reading the short letter, Jennie struggled with her whole body and liked it.\u201cHow?\u00a0How is it?\u00a0Your phillip.\u00a0Here\u2019s my Philip!\u00a0Our prince is mine!\u201d\u201cWritten by hand?\u201d\u201cHuh.\u00a0The writing is really pretty.\u201dJennie handed Peter the letter.\u00a0Peter narrowed his brow for a moment.\u00a0Not long ago, in class for translating English poetry into Korean, Philip wrote a poem on the blackboard at the request of the teacher.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t intentional, but Peter saw Philip\u2019s handwriting and memorized it with his own eyes.It was a very elegant and beautiful typeface, so he thought it would be possible to distinguish it somehow if he looked at it again.However, the handwriting in the letter Jennie was carrying was not Philip\u2019s handwriting he had seen then.\u00a0Of course, this typeface was also pretty, but it was too delicate to say that it was written by a man.After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Peter asked Jennie.\u201cHey.\u00a0Is this a letter from Philip himself?\u201d\u201cThen?\u00a0Then who wrote it?\u00a0Phillip\u2019s name is written here.\u00a0Philip Levin.\u201d\u201cUm, but\u2026 \u00a0Why did he write in English?\u201d\u201cBecause this is America?\u00a0Isn\u2019t English more convenient?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 okay.\u201dWhen the reaction she had expected did not come from Peter, Jenniee hardened her face at once.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Do you think this is not a letter from the prince?\u201d\u201cNo, not that!\u201d\u201cYou think it\u2019s impossible for someone like Philip to reply to me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0Jennie, I mean\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0I thought only you would be happy.\u201dWhen Jennie turned her back and cried, Peter got up from the bed in a panic.\u201cNo.\u00a0So Philip\u2026\u201dPeter thought he had to confide in everything.\u00a0He tried to say that it because he saw Philip at a Korean student council meeting, and he saw his handwriting there.\u00a0He tried to apologize for not saying that earlier.However, when he thought that she was crying, Jennie spread her palms and showed her tongue.\u201cI was joking!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cI received such a precious letter from the prince, do you think this will make me feel bad?\u00a0Hahaha.\u201dJennie smiled wildly and waved the letter flutteringly.\u00a0Peter sighed, and sat down on the edge of the bed.\u00a0His body was still not completely healed, but he was feeling dizzy.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0You look bad.\u201dJennie asked, looking down at Peter worriedly.\u00a0Peter smiled weakly and shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m on medication.\u00a0I\u2019m just a little sleepy.\u201d\u201cHow about a meal?\u201d\u201cI ate.\u00a0Earlier.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried.\u00a0What did the hospital say?\u201d\u201cI think I need surgery.\u00a0It will probably be a major operation.\u00a0If this surgery goes well, I can run around like everyone else.\u00a0Of course, the success rate is less than 10%.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Huh.\u201dJennie looked at Peter with a gloomy look and clapped her hands as if thinking of something.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0What happened to the novel you sent to the publisher?\u00a0No news yet?\u201d\u201cI totally forgot.\u00a0Hahaha.\u00a0Not yet\u00a0I guess. I just sent it.\u201dAfter reading Peter\u2019s novel in the notebook, Jennie ran barefoot the next day and shook Peter\u2019s shoulder, saying, \u201cYou are a genius, you are definitely a genius.\u201d\u00a0Although Peter was pleased with her words, he objected to sending novels, saying, \u201cHow do I do it?\u201dHowever, Jennie typed Peter\u2019s novel and handed it to him, and Peter got the courage to contribute to the publishing house.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u00a0They\u2019ll be in touch soon.\u00a0If the publisher is blind and doesn\u2019t accept your novel, send it elsewhere.\u00a0Do you know how many times the aunt who wrote Harry Potter was rejected by the publishing house?\u201d\u201cHow do I compare my novel to that?\u201d\u201cI think yours is a lot more fun.\u201dThe novel is about a boy who discovers a door that connects to another world in his dream and the dream affects reality, and the story continues in a dreamlike manner throughout.\u00a0As soon as the next day dawned, Jennie finished reading the notebook she had been reading all night long and ran to Peter.\u201cObviously it will be fine.\u00a0Keep writing, keep writing.\u201dPeter laughed shyly.\u00a0Jennie took his hand and said.\u201cIt will definitely work.\u00a0You are a special kid.\u00a0I can tell.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u00a0If I succeed, I will buy a castle and give you a special floor.\u201d\u201cReally?\u00a0Oh well, then I\u2019ll have to call Aunt Spencer and tell her I can\u2019t go to her house.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Be sure to do that.\u201dThe two laughed heartily.\u00a0The swear words of a hoarse woman looking for Jennie from the house next door resounded.\u00a0Jennie sighed.\u201cI will go.\u201dJennie waved to Peter.\u00a0Peter waved his hand weakly.\u201cTake good care of yourself.\u00a0See you next time.\u201d\u201cYea, I got it.\u201dAfter Jennie left, Peter went back to bed.\u00a0The heat that hadn\u2019t completely subsided yet made his closed eyes stiff.\u00a0Reminding him of the love letter that came from Philip made him laugh.Peter remembered writing Jennie\u2019s letter for him.\u00a0When he chose the orange stationery, Jennie was worried that it would stand out too much for a love letter.\u00a0When he replied that orange is the color of the sun and so it was the color of the prince, Jennie immediately agreed.\u00a0Peter wrote the letters on the stationery he had chosen by hand.As if he was the one sending the love letter.His face heated up at the thought that Philip had read the letter he had written as if he had transferred his heart, letter by letter.His body got hot again.\u00a0Peter thought of the boy who laid in bed for a while, holding an orange stationery.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you ignoring people\u2026\u201dPeter started running without looking back.\u00a0Fred was heard screaming and swearing from behind.\u00a0It was scary.\u00a0It didn\u2019t matter if he was teased for being a coward.\u00a0For now, he just wanted to avoid Fred.Before long, Peter felt his heart ripped open and grabbed his chest.\u00a0The sudden beating of the wind seemed to put a strain on his heart.\u00a0Still, he could not stop running for fear that Fred would follow.\u00a0Just around that corner, just around that corner\u2026\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dPeter fell backwards.\u00a0The person who collided with him also fell down with a sharp scream.\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u00a0Watch where you\u2019re going.\u201d\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dPeter apologized and reached out to lift the woman who had fallen to the floor.\u201cSorry.\u00a0I am\u2026\u201dPeter was speechless.\u00a0The pain in his heart was throbbing and spreading.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t breathe and his face was pale, and as he stood there, he looked at the woman he had bumped into with a pale face.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026no.\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Should I call an ambulance?\u201dHis legs staggered and he fell.\u00a0Peter sat down and took a deep breath.\u00a0He needed to take his medicine.\u00a0Medicine\u2026Peter tried to open the bag with trembling hands, but the strength in his hands did not work, and the items in the bag poured out.\u00a0No matter how much he breathed, he felt like he wasn\u2019t getting enough oxygen.\u00a0He heard\u00a0 a buzzing, like a swarm of bees flying in his ear, and a cold sweat broke out.\u00a0Someone patted him on the cheek and shouted something.\u00a0He blinked several times because he couldn\u2019t see well.\u2018Oh, will I die like this?\u00a0Who will make Will take a walk every morning?\u00a0I have to tell my grandmother I love you, I have to honestly confess to my mother that I broke the bowl when I was seven, and I also have to tell my father that I was the one who took the $15 that had been deposited in advance\u2026\u00a0I have to tell Jenny that I actually know the prince, and\u2026The prince\u2019s face flashed before his eyes.\u00a0Peter involuntarily grabbed the hem of his shirt.\u00a0There were still things he hadn\u2019t said yet.\u00a0He wanted to tell him about Mujin Travel.\u00a0It was interesting, it was a beautiful article, so he had to say it was a must read\u2026\u00a0It was hard to even lick his lips, let alone speak a word.Someone grabbed him by the nape, stood him up, and held out the medicine in his bag in front of him.\u00a0Realizing what that meant, Peter barely nodded.\u00a0The pill entered his mouth.\u00a0Then water ran down his throat.\u00a0After barely swallowing the pills, Peter held his breath for a long time.\u201cWhat is it?\u00a0Who is it?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI think he suddenly collapsed.\u201dHe could hear voices whispering around him.\u00a0His blurry vision became clearer and clearer.\u201cAre you back to your senses?\u00a0Can you hear my voice?\u201dHe heard the voice of the woman he had bumped into earlier.\u00a0Thank God.\u00a0He bumped into a friendly woman.Peter nodded.\u00a0Now it felt like he was breathing slowly.\u00a0Then he saw the face of the woman he had bumped into.\u00a0It was Melinda.\u00a0Having a Korean mother and a French American father, she was one of the most beautiful women in the Korean student council.\u00a0Not only was she fluent in French and English, but she was also fluent in Korean, and she was also the leader of the cheerleading team.\u201cShould I call an ambulance?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026\u201dPeter barely answered.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dA soft male voice came from behind.\u00a0Melinda nodded and smiled.\u201cI only bumped into him a littles.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t hurt.\u201dIt was then that Peter realized that it wasn\u2019t Melinda who was holding his neck.\u00a0At the same time, he let go of the cuffs he was holding.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dThis time, the gentle voice of a man asked Peter.\u00a0His heart, which had barely calmed down, began to pound again.\u201cI took the right medicine out of your bag, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dWhile answering, Peter did not raise his head.\u00a0It was more shameful to fall in front of him than to fall on the road.\u201cCan you get up?\u201dPhilip asked again.\u00a0Peter nodded, and the hand that was holding his neck held him tighter and lifted him up.\u00a0Melinda picked up the spilled items from the bag and put them back into the bag.Philip\u2019s gaze was warm as he looked at her with a beautiful appearance and a kind heart.\u00a0He wiped the dust off Melinda\u2019s clothes and asked if she was okay again.\u201cYea.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI was worried. I came running because you fell down.\u201dPeter stared blankly at the two of them having a friendly conversation.\u00a0The appearance of the two full of beautiful energy just by standing side by side caught the attention of passersby.\u00a0Peter thought they were a very well-matched couple.\u00a0As he thought about it, his heart ached strangely.He puts the bag back on his shoulder.\u00a0Melinda once again kindly asked if he was really okay.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u00a0Really.\u201dHe was taught to live with gratitude for people\u2019s kindness, but Peter was not as grateful for her kindness as for this moment.\u00a0The closer he was to the two of them, the more ashamed he felt of his weak and poor self.It seemed as if he had melted to the floor and disappeared, just how shabby he was.\u201cOh, wait a minute.\u201dAt the sound of Philip calling him, Peter froze on the spot.\u201cI think this is yours.\u201dPhilip held out the orange letterhead to Peter.\u00a0Peter hurriedly grabbed the stationery and shoved it into his bag.\u00a0If he had read Jennie\u2019s letter, he would have clearly noticed that it was the same stationery\u2026 Especially since it was a letter written in Korean\u2026\u2018This is not a letter I wrote.\u00a0It was just a translation\u2026\u00a0So, at the request of a friend, I just\u2026\u00a0\u2018Peter had all sorts of answers in his head, afraid he might ask him about the letter.\u00a0His fingers stiffened for fear that he might misunderstand the love letter.But Philip didn\u2019t ask anything.\u00a0He put his hand on Melinda\u2019s shoulder and disappeared into the building.\u00a0The people around Peter started going their own way one by one.Left alone on the road, Peter thought he could not figure out what was the cause of this vague pain in his chest.The orange stationery in the bag weighed heavily on his shoulder.\u201cWhat about design?\u201d\u201cWell.\u00a0I\u2019m a glamorous person with a full chest, so should I choose a style that enhances the curves of my body?\u201d\u201cWhat color?\u201d\u201cGold?\u00a0Wouldn\u2019t gold suit me?\u201d\u201cI think the color blue would look good too.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dSitting side by side in a small room, talking about various things, the two were drawing different clothes with colored pencils.\u201cI should match the color with the prince.\u00a0I wish the prince would tie a tie in the color of the dress I wear.\u201dPeter\u2019s hand, who was painting with a blue colored pencil, paused for a moment.\u201cThe reply\u2026\u00a0did it come?\u201d\u201cDo you want me to show you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou are being strange.\u00a0Why don\u2019t you want to see it?\u201d\u201cWhy would I read other people\u2019s letters?\u00a0It\u2019s weird that you\u2019re going to show me all that.\u201dPeter grumbled, pretending it was nothing.Replies from Philip were steadily coming.\u00a0Jennie now visits Peter almost every two days to translate the letter.\u00a0Peter translated her letter without a word.When he came across a word he didn\u2019t know, he looked it up in the dictionary and wrote the letter diligently, even if he stayed up all night.However, the reply has not been read since that day.\u00a0It was because the pain in his chest that spread every time he remembered Philip standing next to Melinda was getting worse and worse.\u201cAnyway, the prince must have fallen for me.\u00a0He felt something fateful for me.\u00a0If he doesn\u2019t read my letter, he can\u2019t sleep.\u00a0He always said he would end the day by reading my letter once before going to bed!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really going to memorize that.\u201dEvery time Jennie came to Peter, she told him the contents of each letter in detail, to the extent that he could understand it without even reading the reply from Philip.With about a week left until Prom, Jennie\u2019s dream became more and more delirious.\u00a0She even gave up the chocolate she loved so much so that she could wear the dress that suited her perfectly.\u00a0Jennie had no doubts that she would become Philip\u2019s partner.\u201cWill the prince come to pick me up in front of my house?\u00a0I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll bring a nice car.\u201d\u201cDoes he have a license?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u00a0Did I mention that the prince\u2019s father is an English aristocrat?\u00a0Isn\u2019t that really cool?\u00a0So romantic.\u201d\u201cThere maybe\u2026 another partner\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u00a0He exchanges letters with me so passionately.\u201d\u201cBut, by any chance, if Philip is dating someone else\u2026what would you do?\u201dPeter asked cautiously.\u00a0Jennie clicked her tongue and looked at him with accusing eyes.\u201cWhy do you keep repeating this again and again? It\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u201cIf\u2026 no.\u201dPeter, who was about to say something, closed his mouth, and Jennie narrowed his eyes.\u201cWhat?\u00a0What if?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cWhat, what are you going to say?\u201dPeter pondered whether to speak or not.\u00a0He should start by saying that Philip sometimes shows his face in the Korean community like him.\u00a0Then, should he talk about how they met by chance after he went out to buy oranges?\u00a0Should he tell her what he bumped into at the corner?\u00a0Maybe he doesn\u2019t have to talk about Melinda and his help when he collapsed on the street a while ago.After hesitating for a long time, Peter opened his mouth as if he had made up his mind.\u201cAh, Phillip\u2026\u201dThen his mother knocked on the door and called Peter\u2019s name.\u201cPeter!\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Come on in.\u201d\u201cTake this and eat them.\u201dHis mother put the cookies and lemonade down on the desk.\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m choosing a dress for Jennie for Prom.\u201d\u201cOh.\u00a0It\u2019s already happened.\u00a0I was really good back then.\u201dThe girl-like mother made a dreamy expression as she recalled the past.\u201cHave you decided on a partner?\u00a0Are you going with Peter?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I have another prince to go with.\u201d\u201cReally?\u00a0What a waste. I was going to take a picture of you and Peter.\u00a0That\u2019s right, a mail came for you.\u00a0Is it a newspaper?\u201d\u201cA newspaper?\u201dPeter tilted his head and took the envelope his mother gave him.\u00a0He had not expected mail from the newspaper, but his name was really written on the outside of the envelope.\u201cWhat is this?\u00a0Is it an advertisement?\u201d\u201cTake it off.\u201dJennie, who was next to him, encouraged Peter with a somewhat excited look.\u00a0Peter glanced at Jennie as he opened the mail with a letter knife.\u00a0She urged Peter, \u201cTear it quickly, quickly.\u201dInside the envelope was a sheet of paper.\u201cYour manuscript is\u2026\u201dPeter, who had read that far, opened his eyes and looked at Jennie.\u201cQuickly!\u00a0continue!\u201d\u201cWhat manuscript?\u00a0What is it?\u00a0Read it quickly.\u201dPeter\u2019s mother was also excited and motioned for him to read the next part of the letter.\u00a0Peter stuttered while reading.\u201cI read the manuscript well.\u00a0Congratulations.\u00a0In this contest, your novel won a prize in the short story section\u2026\u201dPeter\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0He quickly scanned the contents of the letter once more.\u00a0He also checked the name on the envelope.\u00a0Clearly, it was a letter for him.\u00a0But he had no memory of sending the manuscript to this newspaper.\u201cDid you write a novel?\u00a0Did it win an award?\u201dHis mother, who did not know that her son was writing, asked in surprise.\u201cI wrote it\u2026 I never sent a manuscript here\u2026\u201dIt was clear that something was wrong.\u00a0Peter thought that there was a mistake and the mail was delivered incorrectly.\u201cI sent it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere was no contact from the publisher, so I sent it to the newspaper.\u00a0I read in the newspapers that there was a novel contest.\u00a0Well, actually, I wasn\u2019t reading the newspaper, I was eating bread and jam near the newspaper.\u00a0I think the publisher\u2019s eyes were strained.\u00a0He didn\u2019t recognize your great novel!\u00a0So I have no choice but to send it elsewhere.\u201dPeter couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut and looked at the letter and Jennie\u2019s face alternately.\u201cPerhaps\u2026 are you mad?\u00a0Sending your novels on my own terms?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0no.\u201d\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you happy?\u201dWhen she asked carefully, Peter answered with a blank expression, blinking his eyes a couple of times.\u201c\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m so happy I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\u201cJust scream!\u00a0Wow!\u201dJennie jumped and spread her arms towards Peter.\u00a0Moving her heavy body to and fro, she ran around Peter.\u00a0Then Peter screamed like a child and embraced her.All of this seemed like a dream.\u00a0He was unbelievably happy.When he did not receive a call from the publishing company, he pretended to be okay on the outside, but in fact, he was depressed and dehydrated on the inside.\u00a0Perhaps, as she said, he was excited to think that he might have a talent for writing, and waited for a call from the publisher.The reason he did not write down his email address or cell phone number on purpose and only wrote down the address was because he thought the mail would be less anxious to wait.\u00a0Of course, Peter had to check his mailbox every morning, open it after lunch, open it in the evening, and even open it before going to bed to confirm that he was wrong.By the time he gave up waiting for a call from the publisher, Peter stopped thinking about the novel at all.\u00a0In fact, these days, he didn\u2019t even have time to translate Jennie\u2019s letter.\u201cI, I got an award!\u201dPeter exclaimed.It was the first time in his life that he was recognized by someone he didn\u2019t know.\u00a0His parents always told him that he was a special child, but Peter never thought of himself as special.\u00a0His body was weak and he went to school late, so he just thought that he was lagging behind others.\u00a0Peter prayed that the day would come when he would prove his parents\u2019 faith at least once.And today was that day.\u201cYou are a special kid.\u00a0It\u2019s a natural result.\u201dPeter\u2019s mother was also delighted to see the two hugging and running wild.\u00a0She alternately kissed their foreheads and shouted that they must have a party tonight.\u201cI thought it would be you.\u00a0of course.\u00a0Because you have talent.\u201d\u201cThanks\u201d\u201cIf I live in the castle later, I will keep my promise.\u201dJennie said, squinting one eye.\u00a0Peter nodded eagerly.\u00a0His mother went downstairs to call the family and tell them the news.\u201cGo after eating dinner.\u00a0There will be something really good today.\u201dJennie shook her head.\u201cI have a lot of homework, I have to write a love letter to the prince, and I have to think more about the dress design.\u00a0I have a lot of work.\u201dJennie\u2019s mother always prayed and ate at the same time.\u00a0Peter knew from the stories of grown-ups that Jennie would be beaten once every minute if she was even a little late.\u201cBesides, Aunt Spencer will call me at 7 o\u2019clock.\u00a0Obviously to talk about my dress.\u00a0I think she\u2019s giving me a dress from a great brand as a gift.\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s an important call, so you must answer it.\u201dJennie\u2019s mother also banned her from using her cell phone.\u00a0The only way Jennie could make a call was through an old-fashioned phone in her living room.\u201cThen I will go.\u201dJennie said goodbye.\u00a0Peter thanked her again.\u201cReally, thank you.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing.\u00a0You have to buy me something delicious later.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dPeter smiled and waved his hand.\u00a0After Jennie went down the stairs, his mother came back up.\u00a0She said that his father was coming home and that she would call all of their relatives as well.\u00a0Peter blushed and said that it wasn\u2019t such a big deal, but his mother rejoiced as if he had won the world.Not long after, his very excited father ran in, unable to park his car properly.\u00a0His younger brothers who were at their grandmother\u2019s house also gathered and everyone rejoiced as if they were the ones who won.Peter felt fortunate to be here, at a moment when his presence brought happiness to others.That day, he was the happiest person in the world.Previous Chapter<All

getting happier.\u00a0After receiving congratulatory calls from all his relatives, his mother invited all of his relatives living nearby to a party for him.\u00a0When he received the award from the newspaper, the whole family came to congratulate him on his award.\u00a0Because it was a contest with more authority than Peter had thought, his victory even made it to the local newspapers.\u00a0His mother cut out the small article from the corner of the local newspaper and put it on the top of the refrigerator, and his father was delighted to see his son\u2019s certificate several times a day.\u00a0Upon hearing the news about his award, the president of the Korean Association contacted him to give him a plaque of merit.\u00a0Even in the student council, the teacher who taught literature called Peter forward and told the students the story of his award.\u00a0Many students, who had not even noticed the existence of the boy named Peter by then, congratulated him.\u00a0Melinda and Philip were also in it.\u00a0Philip said congratulations, but Peter responded in a trembling voice to thank him.\u00a0When Philip joked that he should get an autograph from the future writer teacher in advance, everyone around him burst into laughter.\u00a0It was silly, but Peter went home that night and practiced his signature diligently by himself.\u00a0Each time he wrote his name on a piece of paper, he reflected on his future success as a writer.\u00a0Those were happy days.All of this had happened over the course of a week, so Peter couldn\u2019t help but feel a surge of euphoria.\u00a0The only concern for him now was Jennie.\u00a0At first, she rejoiced as if it was her job, but the depression cycle came again and she was confined to the house for the third day.\u00a0As always, Peter waited for her to come to him first.One night, he was startled when Jennie threw a small stone at Peter\u2019s window.\u00a0Jennie\u2019s face was swollen all over, and her forearms were full of traces of self-harm.\u00a0There was even a bluish bruise near the temple, probably from hitting it somewhere.It was Peter who always pretended not to know her small wounds, but at that time, he couldn\u2019t do that.\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u00a0Why is your arm like this?\u201d\u201cIt was scratched.\u00a0I fell.\u201dIt was never a fall and scratch.\u00a0Peter felt his heart clench and urged her.\u201cJennie.\u00a0It\u2019s not right to hurt yourself.\u00a0You know that too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re having a hard time, tell me\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat happens if I talk to you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m having a hard time, should I tell someone?\u00a0So what will be different?\u00a0It just makes me depressed and you will be depressed too.\u201dShe rolled her eyes and bit her lip.\u00a0Her lower lip was ragged with tooth marks.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything depressing.\u00a0Nothing will change\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cHow about getting counseling?\u201d\u201cAnyway, forget about this.\u00a0Do you think they could change my mother?\u00a0Nothing changes.\u00a0As long as those humans don\u2019t kill us, this problem will repeat forever.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u00a0Why would we die?\u00a0Don\u2019t say such scary things.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that again.\u00a0You said that when I\u2019m sick, you\u2019re sad too.\u00a0Me too.\u00a0Do you know what I mean?\u201dPeter took her hand and said.\u00a0Jennie nodded her head reluctantly.\u00a0After being silent for a while, she struggled to speak in a bright voice.\u201cI spoke to Aunt Spencer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yea.\u201d\u201cShe was supposed to buy my dress, but I refused.\u00a0I don\u2019t think it\u2019s polite to just receive a gift every time.\u00a0What do you think?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u00a0It\u2019s best to do what you want.\u201dPeter guessed that Jennie\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t buy her a dress.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of buying with the money I saved up, are you going to go pick one up with me?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThen a faint smile spread across her lips.\u201cThen we\u2019ll go pick it up tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhat time?\u201d\u201cFour o\u2019clock.\u201dHe had promised to go to the department store with his mother at 4 o\u2019clock, but Peter nodded obediently.\u201cGreat.\u201dThe two got up from the bench.\u00a0After saying goodbye and parting, Peter put a little more force than usual and hugged her tightly.\u00a0But at 4 o\u2019clock the next day, she didn\u2019t show up.\u00a0After waiting for her for a long time, Peter had no choice but to go to the department store with his mother.From then on, Jennie\u2019s whims continued.\u00a0She came to Peter when she felt like it, and talked for a while.\u00a0Peter noticed that her nonsense was getting worse as time went on, but the thought that Jennie was having a hard time just broke his heart.\u00a0He believed that one day she would return as a happy Jennie, and he would stand by her side.\u00a0But she gradually sunk into the abyss of melancholy.\u00a0When she saw Peter talking kindly with his mother, she would often get angry and go home, and she would argue with nonsense reasons.\u00a0Even Peter, who was trying to heal the wounds of his best friend, began to feel the limits of his patience.What made her the most depressed was that the letter from the prince had been cut off.\u00a0At first, Jennie bit her nails nervously, saying there must be some mistake.\u00a0Eventually, she yelled at Peter that he must have written something strange in the letter.\u00a0Peter was astounded.\u00a0But he swore he would never do that because he couldn\u2019t let Jennie be mad at him.\u00a0However, Jennie\u2019s anger did not subside, and it all poured fiercely on Peter.\u2018It\u2019s all thanks to me that you received an award, not because you\u2019re good. Don\u2019t be so proud of receiving an award like that. Did you do such a cowardly thing because your stomach hurts since I\u2019m doing well with the prince?\u2019\u00a0etc.Peter\u2019s blood boiled, not knowing what to do with every nonsense she poured out.\u00a0He knew from the many books he had read for Jennie how depressed people express their frustration and anger towards others.\u00a0However, it was the first time that her anger had been poured out on him in this way, so Peter could not respond properly.How many times did Peter convince Jennie that he hadn\u2019t done it, that he didn\u2019t know how much he valued her, but she kept talking\u00a0 like a mad racehorse with her ears covered.As Jennie grew more violent, her delusions got worse, and she even went on to say that the prince came to her house last night and sang to her.\u00a0Peter was heartbroken.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t sleep that night, so he read until late at night, so he knew Philip didn\u2019t go to Jennie\u2019s house.Jennie talked about the song and the lyrics the prince sang for her for an hour, then shut her mouth and stared at Peter coldly.\u00a0Why was her expression like that?\u00a0The story that began with absurdity came to a forced end by saying that he made things that way because he was jealous of her again.Peter was upset and angry enough to cry, but he had to release his anger alone each time.\u00a0This time, he believed that her melancholy cycle was only getting longer, and that, as usual, his dear friend would be heartbroken watching everything inside.\u00a0It was only natural that, as a young Peter, he could not even guess how serious her condition had become, because the extent of her heartache could not be seen with the naked eye.The end of Jennie\u2019s melancholy cycle was as sudden as a midsummer rain shower.\u00a0Running up the stairs with a lot of fuss, she held out an envelope to Peter and shouted excitedly.\u201cThere is a letter from the prince!\u00a0No, I have an invitation.\u201d\u201cInvitation?\u201dPeter, who was reading a book, got up halfway from the bed.\u201cHe\u2019s inviting me to the party.\u00a0This is really big news.\u00a0The only people invited to this party are the really popular kids who are rumored to be hot at school!\u201dShe screamed in excitement.\u00a0Peter couldn\u2019t be happier with her words.\u00a0Considering Jennie\u2019s condition these days, it was inevitable that the first thing that came to mind was whether the letter was true.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Maybe it was sent by another friend?\u00a0Another friend who likes you.\u201dPeter asked carefully so as not to offend Jennie.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u00a0Who else could send me an invitation like this other than the prince?\u00a0Are you saying you won\u2019t believe what I\u2019m saying now?\u00a0Come on, let\u2019s see.\u00a0What is written here?\u201dThe letter Jenny got simply stated that he wanted to invite her to the party and the location and time.\u00a0Peter recalled Philip\u2019s handwriting he had seen recently.\u00a0It was quite different from what was written on the letterhead.Enough to be recognized by anyone who sees it.Peter was very upset and decided he had to tell Jennie about it.\u201cYou know,\u00a0 I go to Korean gatherings once every weekend, right?\u201d\u201cHuh.\u00a0Why?\u201d\u201c\u2026Philip sometimes comes there too.\u201dJenny put on a puzzled expression.\u201cNot every week, but occasionally.\u201d\u201cWhy are you talking about this now?\u00a0Hey!\u00a0Do you know how hard it was for me to put the letter in the prince\u2019s locker?\u00a0There were times when I pretended to be sick in class and put it in!\u00a0If I knew that he went to the same place as you, it would have been better if I asked you to deliver a letter!\u201dJennie got angry at the wrong point.\u201cNo, you see him at least once a week anyway\u2026 sometimes I can\u2019t go because I\u2019m sick.\u201d\u201cBut.\u00a0Because letters were exchanged once every three or four days.\u00a0Hmmm, but?\u00a0Why are you talking about that now?\u201dJennie put on a very suspicious look.\u00a0Peter swallowed hard.\u201cI was going to say \u2026\u00a0but kept missing out on opportunities.\u00a0He has no connection whatsoever with me.\u201dAs he said this, Peter continued to fiddle with his fingers.No contact.There was contact.\u00a0He thought of Philip and probably memorized his face and name.\u00a0But he couldn\u2019t say that to Jennie.He didn\u2019t want to tell anyone about it, because he didn\u2019t know exactly the palpitations or chest pains he felt when he saw Philip meant.\u00a0No, he really didn\u2019t want to share those feelings with anyone.Peter comforted himself by saying that he felt sorry for Jennie, but that he could keep this as a secret.\u201cReally?\u00a0Well, indeed.\u00a0The prince is always full of people.\u00a0You couldn\u2019t have intervened there.\u201dAt that, Peter groaned for a moment.\u00a0He wanted to counter that he had talked to Philip before, and he said congratulations to him a while ago, and joked that he would get an autograph if he became a famous writer.But now it was useless.\u00a0Peter had to focus on the purpose of bringing up this story.\u201cSometimes, I see Philip writing on the blackboard or taking notes in his notebook.\u201d\u201cWow!\u00a0That would be really cool\u00a0A prince who writes on a blackboard.\u201dJennie replied with a smirk as if the world\u2019s most delicious pie was in front of her.\u201cHowever\u2026 The font is different.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe handwriting on the letter is different from Phillip\u2019s.\u201dHaving said that, Peter bowed his head.\u00a0He thought it was normal for Jennie to scream or get angry.\u00a0She may swear at him.\u00a0Barely out of depression, she could have plunged back into the depths of despair.\u00a0Peter was prepared for the worst.However, the response that came back was unexpected.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0What are you talking about?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0uh?\u201d\u201cIs the font different?\u00a0What is that?\u00a0Does he have multiple fonts?\u00a0A font for doing homework, a font for writing reflections, a font for writing a diary.\u00a0Everyone is different.\u201dShe said, pointing out each hand one by one.\u201cNo, I mean\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat else do you want to say?\u00a0Ha ha ha ha, did you like that that much?\u201dJennie asked Peter as if he were a child.\u201cBecause it\u2019s not.\u00a0That\u2019s not it, obviously the font\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cYou are too suspicious.\u00a0Peter.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201dPeter knew how Jenny was treated at school.\u00a0He had been treated similarly, so he was several times more worried about her than other people.\u00a0It\u2019s strange that Philip willingly invited her to a party even though they didn\u2019t know each other, and it was also strange that he has Melinda next to him and he dares to ask her to be his partner.\u00a0What would he do if she went to the party and other people were harassing Jennie?\u201cI understand why you\u2019re worried about me, but this time it\u2019s for sure.\u00a0It\u2019s an invitation sent by the prince himself.\u00a0No one can say anything.\u201dJennie shrugged and patted Peter\u2019s back with her palm.\u00a0Her pleasant voice and actions almost brought tears to his eyes.\u201cAh, what should I do?\u00a0It\u2019s a party this weekend and I don\u2019t have any clothes to wear\u2026\u00a0!\u00a0No.\u00a0This a masquerade party.\u00a0How do I Prepare?\u201d\u201cMasquerade Party?\u201d\u201cYes. We need a meeting right now!\u00a0Meeting tonight!\u201dJennie shouted.\u00a0Peter smiled broadly.\u00a0He struggled to suppress the anxiety that was creeping up in his chest and welcomed his friend who had come back to him.There was no time to even think about what that single piece of paper would bring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Love History Caused by Willful NegligenceCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChoi Inseop was looking at a photo that was miraculously taken today.\u00a0It was miraculous and fortunate to be there at that moment.\u00a0However, he could not rejoice to his heart\u2019s content at the terrifying luck that had come upon him.Even for a person he terribly disliked, it was not very pleasant to see him lying on the floor bleeding.\u00a0As soon as he confirmed that the person who fell to the floor was KangYoungmo, Inseop found a nearby pay phone and called 119.\u00a0After pretending to be a passerby and reporting without revealing his identity, Inseop hid behind an alley and left only after confirming that an ambulance was taking Kang Youngmo.Then, on purpose, he walked for a long time and got on the bus back home.\u00a0As soon as he got home, he connected his phone to his computer and checked the photos.\u00a0It was clearly captured so that anyone could see at a glance that the person in the photo was Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0In the photo, Lee Wooyeon was throwing his wallet in front of the alley with an expressionless face.\u00a0Obviously, if this case was passed on to the police, they will also check that the wallet is missing, so this photo will be undeniable evidence if he tried to deny it.Choi Inseop printed the picture.\u00a0A printed photo was pasted on a board hanging on the wall of his room.\u00a0The board was packed with materials about Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0In the middle of it, everything was completed by attaching the photo taken today.\u201c\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s it.\u00a0Now.\u201dChoi Inseop muttered blankly in front of the board.The hours he struggled to collect data about Lee Wooyeon flashed through his mind like a lantern.\u00a0While waiting for Lee Wooyeon in the cold, there was a time when the sole of his shoe was torn because it was frozen on the floor and he forcefully removed it.\u00a0How many times he cried as he dragged those shoes back home.\u00a0There was a time when he was looking through the trash and was taken to the police station as a thief.\u00a0Was that all?\u00a0Wearing a hat and wearing a mask, he followed Lee Wooyeon, but was caught by his female fans and was mistaken for a pervert stalker and beaten in the cheek.\u00a0There were times when he cried every night because he wanted to return to the United States, but he finally rose to the position of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u00a0Of course, it didn\u2019t end there.\u00a0Rather, it was physically exhausting to gather information about Lee Wooyeon while circling around him, but mentally it was uncomfortable.\u00a0Staying next to him, talking and maintaining social relationships was the biggest hardship for Inseop. He had to watch \u00a0Lee Wooyeon in a panicked state, whether he would recognize him or not, whether he was aware of his identity.\u00a0In addition, the process of realizing that his feelings for Lee Wooyeon were gradually changing gave him a terrible depression that was difficult to bear.\u201cIt\u2019s over, now, it\u2019s over.\u00a0All you have to do is hand it over to the newspaper.\u00a0Hahahaha, now really\u2026\u00a0 Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201dLaughter erupted.\u00a0It was so funny that once laughter broke out, it was hard to stop.\u00a0Choi Inseop laughed like crazy in front of the board he put all his heart into.\u00a0He smiled enough to worry about what would happen if other people saw him.Not having the strength to laugh anymore, he sat down on the floor and sobbed, and Inseop suddenly realized that he was crying.\u201c\u2026\u00a0ugh\u2026Hahaha\u2026\u00a0ha.\u201dLaughter came from his stomach, but tears from his chest.\u00a0Not knowing what to do with the jumbled emotions, he just cried and laughed again.\u00a0It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s sad, and painful.Why did Lee Wooyeon make Kang Youngmo like that?\u00a0Because of him?\u00a0No, Lee Wooyeon was not someone who moved with a sense of justice.\u00a0Because Lee Wooyeon was a really bad guy.\u00a0That\u2019s how it should be\u2026\u00a0What is this heart that he did not want to believe even after seeing it with his own eyes and taking pictures?\u00a0He can go to America, so why is his heart so heavy?He believed that this feeling that had been weighing down on his heart since he came to Seoul would disappear when everything was settled, but he guessed that wasn\u2019t the case.For Jennie, he worked hard to prove her words and got the results.\u00a0After taking revenge like that, he thought that the guilt he felt against her would fade a little.\u00a0However, as time passed, Inseop became more aware that he was attracted to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0The guilt increased as the heart grew bigger.Like a person walking in a thick foggy forest where he couldn\u2019t see an inch in front of him, each day went on with each passing minute.\u201cStuffy\u2026\u00a0\u201dChoi Inseop came out of the room.\u00a0The only advantage of a rooftop room is that he can get fresh air by opening the door when the room gets hot, or even when it is cold.He sat down on the old sofa left behind by someone who lived before him.\u00a0He heard that the days when he could see the stars were rare because the sky in Seoul was cloudy, but today seems to be one of those rare days.It was a lucky day in many ways.\u00a0In the succession of luck, Choi Inseop sat blankly with a gloomy face.Slowly, he had to organize his life here.\u00a0He had to quit his job and give up his house\u2026\u00a0No, he\u2019ll have to look for a plane ticket first.Everything was over.But his heart doesn\u2019t end here.Recalling the bitter things to come, Inseop stood up from his seat.\u00a0Then the phone in his pocket rang.\u00a0Inseop saw the name floating on the screen and felt his blood cooling down.Should he answer it or not?\u00a0After hesitating for a moment, he cleared his voice and pressed the call button.\u201cYes.\u00a0This is Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dA soft, elegant voice came from over the phone.\u00a0Inseop only prayed that Lee Wooyeon would not notice that he was trembling.\u201cYes.\u00a0What are you doing?\u201dHe pretended to be casual and asked that, but his heart was pounding as if someone was nailing it.\u00a0He remembered Lee Wooyeon walking out of the alley, and it felt like the fingertips holding the phone were freezing cold.\u201cI just remembered and called.\u201dWhen the unexpected answer came, Inseop didn\u2019t know how to respond, so he paused for a moment.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Can\u2019t I just call?\u00a0To my manager?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I don\u2019t mean that.\u00a0It\u2019s just surprising\u2026\u00a0\u201dSo far, he has worked with Lee Wooyeon for a long time, but he swore he has never made a private phone call like this.\u00a0The first day he made a private phone call was the night that made Kang Youngmo like that.The sweeter Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice came from over the phone, the more terrified Inseop was.\u00a0He had to keep his nerves so that his voice did not tremble as he spoke.\u201cI\u2019m going home, and the stars are bright.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see stars in Seoul.\u00a0If you\u2019re home now, go outside and see.\u201dLee Wooyeon also hosted a radio show for a while.\u00a0Although it was during his rookie period, it was rare to see a well-known actor in charge of being a radio host on a regular basis.\u00a0It was frustrating from the perspective of the agency, as he was in charge of the 2 am program with few listeners.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon made a promise to do it for half a year because it was something he wanted to do.\u00a0The results were surprising.\u00a0It was the only radio broadcast at 2 a.m. to have five advertisements. Later, the radio director of the station directly acknowledged his contribution and even delivered a plaque of appreciation.\u00a0There were also protests from parents because of the girls who nodded in the morning because they couldn\u2019t sleep properly listening to his broadcast.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice was so sweet and soft that he thought maybe he was born for the radio.\u00a0When Inseop put his voice to his ear and listened to it, he seemed to understand the feelings of many female students who listened to the broadcast while enduring the rush of sleep.\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019m\u00a0out now.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you at home?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m home\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m out because I was near the roof.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then Inseop and I are looking at the same sky now.\u201dHe felt his face heat up for some reason at the word \u201cSame Sky\u201d, so he touched his cheek with his hand.\u00a0The weather was much warmer than a few days ago, so his fingertips were not as cold as before.\u00a0Inseop thought so, powerlessly, and shrugged.\u201cIs your body okay?\u201dPutting everything behind, it was a really kind and friendly tone.\u00a0Choi Inseop was terrified.\u00a0He was scared because it was right after he saw such a scene, and he was scared because he couldn\u2019t understand the truth of\u00a0 Lee Wooyeon who called him after doing such a thing\u2026\u00a0He was terrified of thinking that he really liked Lee Wooyeon\u2019s worried voice.\u201cYes.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cYou hurt your finger, but you should have been careful.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dWhen he answered that, he heard a small laugh.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who laughed as if he was really happy, continued.\u201cOkay.\u00a0If you know you\u2019re sorry, let\u2019s be careful in the future.\u201dLet\u2019s be careful.As that word lingered in his ears, the cold face of Lee Wooyeon standing in front of the alley naturally came to mind.\u00a0With his palms wrapped around his cold shoulders, Inseop nodded his head seriously, as if the person on the phone was in front of him.\u201cYes.\u00a0I will.\u201d\u201cThen see you tomorrow.\u201dThe sudden call also ended abruptly.\u00a0Inseop sighed and put his phone in his pocket.It went really well.\u00a0He was sorry for Kang Youngmo, who was lying in bed, but it was really good.\u201cIt ends here.\u201dChoi Inseop mumbled as if he was promising himself.\u00a0Inseop was able to get up from his self-talk that was engraved in his heart.\u201cIt\u2019s late, it\u2019s late.\u201dWhile driving, manager Cha grumbled over and over again.\u00a0Inseop, who was sitting next to him, apologized in a small voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and apologized again.\u201cNo.\u00a0Are you okay?\u00a0Do not worry about it.\u00a0It\u2019s just my habit.\u201dWhile changing lanes, manager Cha answered.\u00a0Because of the absurd incident that happened in front of him yesterday, Choi Inseop forgot to leave the van\u2019s key at the checkpoint.\u00a0In the end, manager Cha, who had to wait for Inseop, who had the key, to come to him in a taxi, was unintentionally late.\u00a0Even though he didn\u2019t know anything else, manager Cha, who was strict about being late, was about to say something to Inseop, but when he saw the scars left on his face, he shut his mouth.\u00a0When he asked how it happened, Inseop only replied that he fell.\u00a0Manager Cha, who had seen a lot of dirt on his floor before, patted him on the shoulder without a word.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s heart grew heavier thanks to his kind words.\u201cLee Wooyeon, he really hates being late.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cIf you want to keep working in the future, keep that in mind.\u00a0never be late.\u00a0Oh really.\u00a0Who is texting again?\u201dThe car manager cried when he heard the cell phone vibrate.\u00a0Inseop struggled to look out the window.It seems that there has been no news from the office yet.\u00a0Perhaps\u2026\u00a0 Kang Youngmo was seriously injured, so maybe the police have ordered him to stay silent.When Inseop\u2019s face grew more melancholic and terrifying thoughts appeared, the van arrived at the underground parking lot where Lee Wooyeon lived.\u201cYou are late.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was waiting for the car, opened the door and shouted.\u201cSorry.\u00a0The road was blocked.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only natural for traffic to be blocked at this hour.\u201dAlthough he spoke softly, manager Cha, who knew Lee Wooyeon\u2019s temperament, broke out in a cold sweat and worked hard to make excuses.\u201cNo, it was more clogged than usual.\u00a0Where did the accident happen?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI am\u2026\u00a0We were late because I took the car keys with me yesterday.\u201dInseop was the first to report the truth.\u00a0Manager Cha quickly blinked, but to no avail.\u201cIs it?\u00a0That\u2019s a big deal.\u00a0You\u2019re a meticulous person.\u201dLee Wooyeon took the script out of his bag and answered indifferently.\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then let\u2019s go.\u201dAt this point, manager Cha, who thought it would be good to end the conversation, said while turning the steering wheel.\u00a0Then his phone vibrated again.\u201cAh, what is it?\u00a0Old man, what are you calling in the morning for?\u201dAfter confirming that CEO Kim was in the phone call, he gestured to Inseop and said,\u201cTake it.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u00a0Me, me?\u201dObviously, if CEO Kim calls at this time, he was about to talk about Kang Youngmo.\u00a0He had no talent for tricking others or acting, so it was very difficult for him to pretend to be surprised.\u201cI\u2019m driving, so there\u2019s no hands-free.\u00a0Take it\u00a0hurry.\u201dInseop glanced at Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting behind him.\u00a0He was just looking at the script with a calm face.This is an important moment.\u00a0Never, never pretend to know.Inseop grabbed the manager\u2019s cell phone and started talking.\u201cYes.\u00a0This is Cha Hyungyu\u2019s cell phone.\u201d\u201cIs Manager Cha there?\u201dThe voice over the phone was very urgent.\u00a0When Inseop heard it, he was sweating profusely and his stomach felt nauseous.\u201cYes.\u00a0He\u2019s next to me and driving.\u00a0If you tell me\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cIs Lee Wooyeon there too?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u00a0 He is.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then put it on loudspeaker.\u201dChoi Inseop held the phone in his hand and looked at manager Cha.\u00a0Manager Cha nodded, noticing that the situation was serious from CEO Kim\u2019s resounding voice without even having to turn on the loud speaker.Choi Inseop returned the call to the loud speaker and put the phone down gently.\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d\u201cWhere are we?\u00a0I got out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house and now I\u2019m going to the filming set\u2026\u00a0\u201dBefore Manager Cha finished his answer, CEO Kim started speaking fast, like a rapid-fire cannon.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u00a0Kang Youngmo was attacked yesterday and is now in the hospital!\u00a0I haven\u2019t heard from the reporters yet, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before it gets

the parking lot, was surprised and he tried to step on the brake but stepped on the accelerator accidentally, and the car jumped over.\u00a0Inseop, who was slow to react because of his injured hand, slammed his head into the ceiling of the car.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked Inseop with a sullen look.\u00a0Inseop nodded his head.\u00a0Manager Cha beckoned him to be quiet and pulled the car to the side of the road.\u201cCEO.\u00a0What did you say now? Speak calmly again.\u00a0Have a glass of cold water!\u201dAs manager Cha yelled, the sound of drinking water was heard over the phone.\u201cha\u2026 So I didn\u2019t hear it directly from the representative, but I crossed over and I don\u2019t know exactly.\u00a0What is certain now is that Kang Youngmo is in the intensive care unit.\u201dChoi Inseop felt the blood drain from his face.In an intensive care unit.\u00a0Shouldn\u2019t he have called from his phone right away instead of looking for a pay phone?\u201cIs he seriously injured?\u201d\u201cIt was not life-threatening.\u00a0He had an emergency surgery yesterday and is recovering now, but has not yet regained consciousness.\u201dHe remembered the blood on the floor, and Inseop\u2019s fingertips trembled.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting behind him, clicked his tongue and folded the script.\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d\u201cI did not!\u00a0If the police know about it, will they stay still?\u201d\u201cNow what are you doing?\u00a0What should I do?\u201dManager Cha asked.\u201cI do not know.\u00a0I should have talked to the director first.\u00a0Even if I go to the filming site, I don\u2019t think I can do anything else right now.\u00a0What are you going to do in this situation right now?\u00a0Really, what is this?\u201d\u201cBy the way, what kind of attack did Kang Youngmo have?\u00a0Anti fan?\u00a0Stalker?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u00a0If it is anti-fan, it\u2019s a completely top-notch anti.\u00a0He hit his head with a brick from behind\u2026\u00a0\u201dCEO Kim, who had spoken up to that point, quickly shut his mouth as if he had realized something.\u00a0The same thought ran through Manager Cha\u2019s mind.Manager Cha looked at Lee Wooyeon, who was looking tired in the back seat.\u201cLee Wooyeon\u2026\u201dCEO Kim called him with a trembling voice.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who had guessed what that word meant, answered by leaning forward.\u201cYes.\u00a0CEO.\u00a0I am listening.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it possible?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u00a0it can\u2019t be.\u00a0Absolutely not.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dManager Cha, who was listening to the words that continued like a question-and-answer session next to him, coughed in vain and cut off the conversation.\u201cCEO Kim.\u00a0We\u2019ll talk about it in the office.\u201d\u201cOay.\u00a0Come to the office right now.\u201dThe call was disconnected.Manager Cha disengaged the side brake and started the car.\u00a0No one spoke in the car on the way to the office.\u00a0Occasionally, there was only the sound of the manager\u2019s sigh.Choi Inseop looked out the window and made up his mind.Now, it\u2019s the start.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

turned on the lights in the office, where no one had come to work, CEO Kim ran up in a hurry.\u00a0When he saw him, who always paid attention to his looks from head to toe, wearing a sweatshirt and a hat, he was able to understand the seriousness of the situation.\u201cWait here, Inseop.\u201dCEO Kim spoke to Inseop and crossed the hallway into his room.\u00a0Manager Cha and Lee Wooyeon followed him.After confirming that the door to the representative room was closed, CEO Kim turned around.\u201cLee Wooyeon.\u00a0was it you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLee Wooyeon sat down on the sofa, with an expression that asked what he meant.\u201cWho else is there besides you?\u00a0Why was Kang Youngmo suddenly attacked from behind?\u201d\u201cWell.\u00a0Could it have been a robbery?\u201dLee Wooyeon replied as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u00a0A fellow actor who was filming a drama with him was attacked and was lying in the intensive care unit, and his reaction was not normal.\u00a0Even with empty words, he never spoke out of concern about Kang Youngmo.\u201cIs the robber crazy to hit a celebrity from behind in the middle of the city?\u201d\u201cHe must be a crazy robber.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled brightly.\u201cDid Kang Youngmo piss you off?\u201dCEO Kim asked directly.\u201cSenior Kang Youngmo has the talent to piss people off.\u201d\u201cYeah, right?\u00a0Is it because he wounded your pride?\u00a0I think Kang Youngmo is a little unfriendly.\u00a0Huh?\u201dBefore things got bigger, CEO Kim pretended to appease Lee Wooyeon, wanting to do something about it.\u201cHe spits a lot when acting, and, um, his mouth smells a little bit.\u00a0He has a bad temper, he pretends to be a good person, and he has no luck.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon pointed out Kang Youngmo\u2019s weaknesses one by one with his fingers, CEO Kim responded with a confused face.\u201cYeah, yes.\u00a0okay.\u00a0 Kang Youngmo has a bad temper, I know that well.\u00a0So, did this happen after fighting with him after you got angry?\u00a0Huh?\u201d\u201cFighting.\u201dLee Wooyeon opened his eyes and answered.\u201cDid I fight with Kang Youngmo?\u00a0Who said that?\u00a0I had a good mood yesterday.\u00a0If you need someone to testify about that, you can bring all the people gathered yesterday.\u201d\u201cBut why did you do that to Kang Youngmo?!\u201d\u201cBe quiet.\u00a0People might hear.\u201dManager Cha motioned for CEO Kim to lower his voice.\u00a0CEO Kim tapped his chest with his fist, pulled water from the refrigerator and gulped it down.\u201cha\u2026\u00a0Let\u2019s start again.\u201dCEO Kim put his hands on the desk and tried to calm down.\u201cSo it\u2019s not you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Why not?\u201d\u201cCEO.\u00a0I\u2019m the one who belongs here in your

these days.\u00a0Yesterday the senior drank too much.\u00a0He was so drunk that he couldn\u2019t even move his body properly.\u00a0When I sent the manager home and said I would take care of it, if I had known it would be like this, I would have been by his side.\u201d\u201cSince when are you so fond of your seniors\u2026\u201d\u201cI can say that I have been affectionate since yesterday.\u201dThat was a really creepy answer.\u00a0CEO Kim shook his head, pressing his temple with his fingers.\u201cReally, it\u2019s not you?\u00a0Even if one article comes out even if it\u2019s useless, it would be shameful.\u00a0Men fighting each other using fists can be daunting.\u00a0Are you really not the one?\u201dManager Cha asked as if to confirm.\u201cI said

manager Cha were wrinkled like rotten and twisted rags.\u201cThen please contact the director.\u00a0If you have anything to say, please contact me.\u201dLee Wooyeon got up from his seat.\u00a0CEO Kim, who did not have the energy to speak any more, waved his hand and asked him to leave.Inseop, who was sitting alone in the corner of the office, saw Lee Wooyeon coming out of the representative office and jumped to his feet.\u201cUh, how is he? Is Kang Youngmo okay?\u201d\u201cWell.\u00a0I haven\u2019t heard the details yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026he, he\u2019s not dead\u2026\u00a0is he?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dLee Wooyeon was careful not to cause trouble as much as possible.\u00a0Of course, there was a high probability that yesterday\u2019s work would be a nuisance, but after removing Kang Youngmo, his mood improved and he felt refreshed as if a tooth had been removed.And above all.\u201cWhat if he is seriously injured?\u201dChoi Inseop, who was restless while crying, came into Lee Wooyeon\u2019s field of vision.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon reached out and grabbed Inseop\u2019s chin.\u201cDid you take any medicine?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou were bruised.\u201dWhen his hand touched Inseop, he blinked with a frightened face.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was briefly immersed in the recollection of how he felt when he tormented a young animal.\u00a0When he pressed on the wound on the corner of Inseop\u2019s mouth pretending it was unintentional, Inseop frowned, saying, \u201cAww!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you put any medicine. What if it leaves a scar?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m not okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dAfter saying that, he felt really bad.\u00a0To cut out all the complicated emotions, he didn\u2019t like the scars on Inseop\u2019s face.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t that it was a waste of a wound on his pretty face.\u00a0He had seen a lot of pretty people in the entertainment industry, so he didn\u2019t really think that Inseop\u2019s looks were great.A round nose, freckles, and eyes that were too large for a small face even made him look uneasy.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t an objectively beautiful face.\u00a0Still, the moment he saw the scratches, he felt a surge of displeasure.\u201cThe medicine is in the cabinet over there.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u00a0But there\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop, who hesitated for a moment, opened his mouth with difficulty.\u201cMr. Kang Youngmo\u2026 Is he really going to be okay?\u201dLee Wooyeon sighed..\u201cDo you like Kang Youngmo?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hate him?\u201dInseop was dazed for a moment at the sudden question, then stuttered an answer.\u201cHe\u2019s, he\u2019s not good, but it\u2019s just\u2026\u00a0, what I don\u2019t like is\u2026\u00a0of course I hate him, but\u2026\u00a0\u201dThis situation, in which he asked whether he liked or disliked the person who was lying in bed injured was uncomfortable for Inseop.\u00a0Of course, if he were to talk about his feelings for Kang Youngmo, it was closer to dislike.\u00a0But he didn\u2019t want him to die or be crippled.\u201cAnyone who sees you would think that you are a fan of Kang Youngmo.\u00a0You are very concerned.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0?\u201dLee Wooyeon waited for Inseop\u2019s next words with a relaxed face.\u201cJust\u2026\u00a0Because we know each other\u2026\u201dInseop felt a heavy burden because he felt that Kang Youngmo\u2019s condition had gotten worse because he had reported late.\u00a0The fact that he endangered people with his vengeance haunted him the whole time he came here.\u201cMr. Inseop is really\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon, who looked at Inseop with his eyes down sadly, narrowed his eyes and smiled.\u00a0Not knowing what he was trying to say, Inseop\u2019s heart raced with anxiety.\u201cInseop!\u00a0Inseop-ah!\u201dCEO Kim opened the door to the representative room and called out his name.\u201cYes!\u00a0CEO.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m calling them right now\u2026\u00a0Why is your face like that?\u201dCEO Kim was surprised to see Choi Inseop\u2019s face and asked.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even think to look at Inseop because he wasn\u2019t in a good mood before.\u201cI fell.\u201d\u201cDo you fall down and get hurt like that? Did you get hit by someone?\u201dCEO Kim glanced at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0If it were him, he would pretend it was a mistake and slap people in the face just because he didn\u2019t like him.When their eyes met, Lee Wooyeon frowned slightly.\u00a0It meant that he didn\u2019t like the misunderstanding.\u201cHe didn\u2019t even put medicine.\u201d\u201cYou have to take medicine.\u00a0Your face is hurt.\u201d\u201cI know.\u00a0I\u2019m worried.\u201dCEO Kim looked at Lee Wooyeon as if he heard something unbelievable.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and asked what.\u201cWorry\u2026?\u201d\u201cOf course I am concerned.\u00a0He is my lifesaver.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u00a0He saved me three times.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u00a0It\u2019s not like that.\u201dInseop strongly denied it, waving his hands.\u00a0Words could not express the pressure he felt whenever the word lifesaver came out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth.\u00a0He had to leave Korea soon and expose Lee Wooyeon\u2019s weakness, so he wasn\u2019t a life saver.\u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver.\u00a0In this case, if the person was a woman, we\u2019ll get married.\u00a0Right?\u00a0CEO.\u201dCEO Kim looked at Lee Wooyeon with a sullen face.\u00a0In front of Inseop, he couldn\u2019t say he was lucky because Inseop was a man.\u201cYeah, yes.\u00a0Well, anyway, Inseop, call here.\u00a0The article will be published in the morning, so if you get calls from\u00a0 reporters, answer them appropriately.\u201dInseop took out his notebook, put a pen between his injured fingers, and calmly wrote down his to-dos.\u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be crazy for a while, so Inseop, you should be careful too.\u00a0In such a case, if any word comes out\u2026\u00a0Well, I did a good job making up his image.\u2026\u00a0.\u201dCEO Kim muttered bitterly and handed Inseop various papers.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was watching Choi Inseop accepting it, put his hands together as if he remembered him.\u201cDon\u2019t put the pen down.\u00a0You have to sign it.\u201d\u201cA sign?\u201d\u201cThe contract signing.\u00a0Have you thought about it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Ah\u2026!\u201dConfused, Inseob missed the pile of paper he was holding.\u00a0Picking up the scattered papers on the floor, he desperately tried not to make eye contact with Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon picked up a piece of paper that had fallen at his feet and handed it to Inseop.\u201cAre you still thinking?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cWhat do you need to think about?\u00a0You don\u2019t like the terms of the contract?\u00a0Then let\u2019s raise your salary a little more.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt was CEO Kim who was surprised this time.\u00a0The terms of the three-year contract written at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s request were so good that it could be said that it was exceptional.\u00a0Even Manager Cha looked at the salary written there and said that it would be better not to show this to other people.Was he suggesting a higher salary?\u00a0Did he go crazy?At CEO Kim\u2019s surprised face, Lee Wooyeon glared at him and said in a soft tone.\u201cCEO.\u00a0If you can have a good person by your side, is money a problem?\u201dHe\u2019s being ripped off.Lee Wooyeon swallowed the words inside and smiled lightly.Although Kang Youngmo was arrogant in front of his eyes, the fact that he kept harassing Inseop was offensive to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0During the drinking party, Kang Youngmo went to the bathroom for a while, while the staff got drunk and discussed various things.\u00a0Kang Youngmo harassed the managers of other actors so much that one or two managers quit after filming together.Lee Wooyeon smiled and said, \u201cYes, yes,\u201d but at that time, he made up his mind to get rid of Kang Youngmo.\u201cIf you have a desired salary, please tell me.\u00a0I will discuss it with the representative and update it.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s enough for now.\u201dEnough and overflowing.\u00a0Inseop was only sorry for everything he received here.\u00a0CEO Kim and Manager Cha treated Inseop, who was in charge of Lee Wooyeon, especially better than the other managers.\u00a0He wouldn\u2019t be able to properly repay such a favor and leave\u2026\u201cThen when are you going to sign?\u201dThere seemed to be no doubt in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mind that Inseop would refuse.\u00a0Inseop replied, \u201cWell, well,\u201d and left the room.CEO Kim made fun of Lee Wooyeon by clicking his tongue.\u201cLee Wooyeon\u2019s getting dumped.\u00a0Don\u2019t you think Choi Inseop doesn\u2019t want to sign?\u201d\u201cIs it possible?\u201d\u201cIf he was going to sign the contract, he would have done it on the day he got the contract.\u00a0Isn\u2019t it so?\u201dIt was half a joke.\u00a0He thought that Lee Wooyeon would pass it on with a light smile as always.\u00a0However, there was no reply from Lee Wooyeon, who was standing there.CEO Kim, who felt a strange energy, turned his head to check Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face, and breathed in.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was standing there with an expressionless face, not smiling or angry.\u00a0Even though Lee Wooyeon was deceiving people inside, he showed various expressions on the outside, so he was able to treat him without hesitation.\u00a0But he couldn\u2019t believe he could make such a face.It was creepy.\u00a0It felt like he had glimpsed the moment when Lee Wooyeon, standing next to him, was out of the human category.\u201cPlease.\u00a0Inseop is my fan.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s face as he said that came back to life again.\u00a0CEO Kim took a deep breath.\u00a0Now it felt like he was talking to a living person.\u201cYeah, yes.\u00a0What\u2026\u00a0But you\u2026\u00a0Kang Youngmo.\u201dCEO Kim and Manager Cha put their heads together in the representative office and discussed measures to save themselves.\u00a0If Lee Wooyeon really hit Kang Youngmo\u2019s head from the back, how should they fix it? How will they convince Lee Wooyeon to go voluntarily to the police?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Will Lee Wooyeon really listen to them?The conclusion was that Lee Wooyeon would never leave any evidence and would never go to the police with his own\u00a0 two feet.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dAs he touched the beard that had grown rough because he had not yet shaved it, CEO Kim made a sad expression.\u201cWhat?\u201cKang Young-mo.\u201d\u201cWhat will I do?\u00a0Am I a doctor?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll buy a red rose and visit him, okay?\u201d\u201cLee Wooyeon!\u201d\u201cHahahaha, I won\u2019t. \u00a0I\u2019ll take good care of it.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u00a0Where are you going?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon looked like he was about to leave, CEO Kim shouted.\u00a0Now, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s every move was an uneasy one.\u201cTo the aesthetician.\u00a0I\u2019ve been filming all night these days, and my skin seems to have gotten rougher.\u00a0Reporters will come.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cThen see you later.\u201dWatching Lee Wooyeon disappearing with a light wave of his hand, CEO Kim cursed himself on the day he cast a young man who came without any connection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

over.As the news spread that Kang Youngmo, who was filming the drama, was lying in the intensive care unit after being attacked by a man on the way home after a dinner party, reporters rushed in with foams in their mouth, saying this was a scoop that comes only once in a hundred years.There was no life-threatening injury, but the skull was cracked and four ribs were broken.\u00a0Rumors spread that the weapon was a brick that had fallen beside him.\u00a0Of course, it happened so quickly that Kang Youngmo did not even notice that someone was approaching behind him.Was it a stalker\u2019s crime?\u00a0Tragedy caused by excessive love, the weapon waiting for him in a dark alley, until the moment of brain death for Kang Youngmo, 10 reasons not to be considered a simple robbery.Each of them published articles with provocative headlines and tips from acquaintances who could not be revealed.\u00a0Filming for the drama was completely stopped, and an emergency meeting was convened that afternoon between the director, broadcaster, and producers.Although Kang Youngmo regained consciousness, the filming was postponed indefinitely due to the fact that he was not currently able to move.Dozens of articles related to Kang Youngmo flooded the Internet every day.\u00a0The interest of reporters was so great that the phone calls were not only made to Kang Youngmo\u2019s agency but to the agencies of the actors who were filming with him as well.\u00a0Although the police could not give exact details, they have announced that it appeared to be the work of a burglar for money.\u00a0Of course, people didn\u2019t listen to such trivial facts.\u00a0The reporters, who knew better than anyone else that the public liked dramatic stories, were eager to uncover the hidden stories.As CEO Kim said, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s surroundings were also full of reporters.\u00a0Reporters followed him everywhere he went, so he couldn\u2019t even eat properly, so he ate bread for three meals in the van.\u00a0Inseop, who managed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule, was also busy.\u00a0Another schedule that had been postponed for filming pushed in, so he had to make adjustments from the beginning, and he could not make long-term plans because he did not know when filming would resume.\u00a0Choi Inseop could not let go of his cell phone as he received dozens of calls from reporters and made dozens of confirmation calls a day.Meanwhile, Inseop slowly cleaned up his surroundings.\u00a0He contacted the landlord and asked for the house to be sold, and he made the deposit to the person he borrowed the name from.\u00a0He wrote down a separate list to donate useful items from his rooftop room and throw away the rest.\u00a0He also booked flight tickets.The last thing left was to be quietly fired.\u00a0This was not difficult.\u00a0When Inseop saw Lee Wooyeon walking by the car, Inseop made up his mind.\u201cAh, I\u2019m tired.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who got into the car through the walls of the reporters, muttered like a sigh and closed the door.\u00a0An important thing happened to Manager Cha, so Inseop decided to drive today.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was skeptical about how to make a person who had a broken bone on his finger drive a car, but Inseop assured him that he could do anything.\u00a0In order to get out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes, it was decided that it would be good to somehow create an opportunity for the two of them.Inseop, who was holding the steering wheel, took a deep breath.Now, let\u2019s start the plan.\u201cAre you tired?\u201d\u201cYes, there are too many people.\u00a0I expected it.\u201dThere was an article on the Internet stating that Lee Wooyeon and Kang Youngmo had an unusual relationship on the set, and he was being hounded several times more than other people.\u00a0Although the surrounding staff and director explained that there was no such thing, those who like to tell other people\u2019s stories paid more attention to gossip than to know the facts.\u00a0Recently, articles that strangely entwined Lee Wooyeon with Kang Youngmo were coming up, so the agency was also very nervous.\u00a0Inseop could guess who was posting the small articles that came up with the photos inside the set.\u00a0Although using a pseudonym, the work of reporter Kim Haeshin was clear.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon also seemed to know that fact, but he didn\u2019t pay much attention to it.\u00a0No, from the beginning, he was consistent with the attitude that this incident was completely irrelevant to him.As time passed, Inseop realized that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s nature might be darker than he thought.\u00a0If he hadn\u2019t witnessed the scene, he wouldn\u2019t have even thought that Lee Wooyeon would have hit Kang Youngmo from behind.Lee Wooyeon was someone who was much better at acting than people knew.However, today Lee Wooyeon got into the car with a strange face.\u00a0He saw a slight wrinkle between his forehead as he lay leaning on the seat.\u00a0That was evidence that Lee Wooyeon was genuinely annoyed.On days like this, he had to be more careful about his actions than usual.\u00a0But Inseop had no intention of doing so.He pretended not to know and spoke to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cCan I play some music?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0That would be nice.\u201dLee Wooyeon had a picky taste in music.\u00a0Knowing that Inseop only played music according to his taste.\u00a0When he was tired like that, he calmed down with a quiet song\u2026Boom, boom, boom, boom, thump, thump.\u201c\u2026\u201dAt the club music echoing inside the van, Lee Wooyeon thought for a moment that his ears were hearing wrong.\u00a0The audio was playing so loud that drivers in the next lane turned their heads at least once to look at the van.\u201cMr. Inseop\u2026 do you even listen to this song?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s good, I like it.\u201dInseop answered in an awkward voice.\u00a0Wanting to do something else, Lee Wooyeon watched Inseop from behind instead of asking him to turn off the music.Between the awkward silence of the two of them, club music filled the space.\u00a0Inseop, who said he liked this kind of song, had his shoulders stiff as a rock and just stared at the front.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising.\u201dLee Wooyeon was the first to speak.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI never thought you would listen to this song.\u00a0You seem to like the club.\u201dInseop kept a notebook with the Ten Commandments not to be fired by Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Now he just had to do the opposite.\u00a0Inseop, who had played\u00a0 the loud and thumping music on purpose, nodded slightly.In fact, he had never even been near the club\u2019s threshold, but for now, he have no choice but to say yes.\u201cDo you go to clubs?\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u00a0I go, sometimes.\u201d\u201cWhere do you go?\u00a0Cheongdam?\u00a0Itaewon?\u201d\u201c\u2026I just go everywhere.\u201dIf he spoke too long in detail, his lies would be exposed, so Inseop only answered in short words.\u201cOkay, then, when are we going together?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u00a0What?!!\u201dHe almost made a sudden stop.\u00a0Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon through the car\u2019s rearview mirror, and made an expression asking what he meant just now.\u201cYou must have been under a lot of stress these days, so you have to go get some relief.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u00a0You\u2019re busy with work, and the situation these days.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon is a celebrity, so if you go there, people will talk behind your back.\u201dHe spoke random words that just came to his mind. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s behind the scenes stories?\u00a0When asked, Inseop nodded his head vigorously.\u201cWho says that these days?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0If we go out and have a drink and hang out, no one will care.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u2018I will care. Me!\u00a0That\u2019s what I pay attention to.\u2019Choi Inseop wanted to cry.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t undo what he spit out, and it tasted like death.\u00a0No, when can a busy Lee Wooyeon go to the club with his manager?\u00a0If he can get fired before then\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201cHow is your schedule this week?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt was supposed to be a drama shoot, but there\u2019s a lot of time left, so wouldn\u2019t it be okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u00a0Yes, but you have other schedules\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dBut, that meant he was not okay.Even if he regretted now thinking that he should have played trot, it was already irreversible.\u00a0In the distance, he can himself waving awkwardly in the club.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLee Wooyeon quietly swallowed a smile when he saw Inseop answering in a depressed mood.So who told him to play this kind of song in the car?\u00a0The guy who did it without notice made him want to bully him too.\u201cSo when are you going to sign the contract?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Oh yeah.\u00a0I\u2019ll think about it a little more deeply\u2026\u201d\u201cAre there any conditions you want?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked, gently furrowing his eyebrows.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s reaction was regrettable.\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re my fan, do a good job and sign a contract, I think you\u2019ll be fine in the industry, but I don\u2019t know why you aren\u2019t signing the contract.\u201d\u201cYet\u2026\u00a0I want to think about it a bit more and make a decision.\u201dNext week, Inseop was due to go to the United States.\u00a0The signing of the contract had to be delayed with some excuse.\u201cNo way\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon narrowed his eyes and lowered his voice.\u00a0Choi Inseop couldn\u2019 figure out what Lee Wooyeon was going to say, so his heart was pounding and he stared at the front of the car, dying.\u201cI mean, do you hate me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t sign because you hate me and you don\u2019t want to work with me?\u201d\u201cNo, I mean, I\u2026\u00a0\u201dWhen sitting in the back seat, he could see many things.Lee Wooyeon enjoyed watching Inseop\u2019s ears turn red while stuttering and making excuses in embarrassment, and his fingers holding the steering wheel trembled slightly.And in a little while, the nape of his neck will slowly be dyed red.\u201cDo you hate me?\u201dWhen he asked once more, Inseop turned bright red all the way to the nape of his neck.\u00a0He thought the wind blowing through the slightly open window was warm, but he just turned redder\u201c\u2026\u00a0No, not like that.\u201dIt was a subtle denial.\u00a0Like it or dislike it..Lee Wooyeon was smiling, but strangely, he was not in a good mood.\u00a0He wanted to grab Inseop by the nape, shake him, and urge him to speak quickly.\u00a0Of course, if he said no, he\u2019d tear his mouth apart.\u201cThen sign the contract.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I\u2019ll think more.\u201dInseop\u2019s stubbornness until the end ignited Lee Wooyeon\u2019s twisted nature.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0What are you doing after your schedule tonight?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who had a soft smile in his eyes, whispered sweetly.After answering the call, CEO Kim screamed and poured all sorts of anger on Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0\u2019Are you insane right now, I don\u2019t know what to say if you go to a place like that when the atmosphere is already bad, remembering your sick colleague at home, or mourn, no, no, take care of yourself with a sad heart, and stress?\u00a0It sounds funny!\u00a0What kind of stress does a guy like you get, your brain doesn\u2019t release stress-producing hormones?\u00a0You bet my finger on it, what?\u00a0Cut off my finger?\u00a0Hey, you son of a bitch!\u00a0Ah fuck!\u00a0Don\u2019t hang up, give it to Inseop, Choi Inseop\u2026\u00a0!\u2019Lee Wooyeon, who had heard everything, smiled lightly and turned off the phone.\u00a0Then, he told Inseop, who was looking at him with worried eyes, that the CEO wanted them to have a good time, and lied sweetly.How many times would he be okay with Inseop while going to the club? Lee Wooyeon asked.\u00a0Even in the middle of the night, Lee Wooyeon, who wore sunglasses in light casual clothes, stood out so much that people who recognized him stopped walking while looking back.There were so many people in the club and the chances of accidents were high.\u00a0Of course, the manager was right to stop Lee Wooyeon from going to the club.\u201cOf course it\u2019s fine.\u00a0I\u2019m here to relieve my manager\u2019s stress.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe was paying the price for one wrong turn of music in the car.Of course, he was under a lot of stress.\u00a0In a little while, he had to fly to the United States and send proof that Lee Wooyeon was a bastard to the world.\u00a0There were a lot of problems that had to be solved before that.\u00a0This meant that now was not the time to be going to a club with Lee Wooyeon.In his mind, he wanted to strike Lee Wooyeon with a slap and cut him off at once in order to get fired as soon as possible.\u00a0It would be impossible, but\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been to this place, so it\u2019s really nice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWhich club does Inseop go to often?\u201d\u201cOh, it was somewhere around here, where was it?\u201dInseop muttered while looking around.\u00a0Seeing him anxiously moving his eyes, Lee Wooyeon folded his arms and thought how long it would take him to say a name.\u201cWhat was the name of the club?\u201d\u201cWhat was the name?\u00a0My memory is fuzzy\u2026\u201d\u201cMr. Inseop has a good memory.\u00a0Didn\u2019t you write it down in your notebook?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who knew Choi Inseop\u2019s habit of taking notes on even the smallest details, asked teasingly.\u201cI left my notebook today\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s sad.\u2019As Lee Wooyeon stopped on the road and was doing this, more and more people began to gather around him.\u00a0Either way, Lee Wooyeon stood watching Inseop as if to remember the name of the store quickly.\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u00a0we can go anywhere.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Wouldn\u2019t it be more convenient to go to the place where Inseop used to go?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dSo the problem was that he didn\u2019t have anywhere to go.\u00a0How can things get so twisted?\u00a0At this point, he didn\u2019t know if he was lucky or not.As Inseop moaned while standing on the road and began to agonize over his life in general, Lee Wooyeon grabbed his shoulder and whispered softly.\u201cThere are too many people.\u00a0Shall we just go nearby?\u201d\u201cYes!\u00a0Great.\u201dLee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s head as he nodded as if he was waiting.\u00a0The women who were looking at him said, \u201cWow,\u201d and let out a small scream.\u00a0Among the women, there were quite a few who looked at Inseop, who was Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, with envy.\u00a0The more he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s kindness, the more complicated Inseop felt.\u201cFollow me.\u201dLee Wooyeon took Inseop\u2019s hand.\u00a0Unable to shake his hand off in front of people, Inseop walked as he led.\u00a0It was the first time in his life that he had received so many people\u2019s attention, but he was more concerned about the wrist Lee Wooyeon was holding.The women could not stop Lee Wooyeon, and they screamed and took pictures or watched the two of them.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon arrived in front of the club, an employee who recognized him contacted the MD, and a person ran out immediately.Since it was a Saturday night, the front of the club was full of people trying to get in.\u00a0Inseop, who had been watching Lee Wooyeon talking with the MD from a distance, thought whether he would run away like this.\u201cCome here.\u201dLee Wooyeon motioned for him to come closer.\u00a0People who recognized Lee Wooyeon took out their cell phones, took a picture of him, and screamed.\u00a0As they walked through the entrance, the sound of music began to reverberate.\u201cThere are a lot of people, so follow me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201dLee Wooyeon shouted into Inseop\u2019s ear.\u00a0Inseop pressed his warm ears with his palms and nodded.\u00a0After sitting at the seat that the club MD guided, Inseop looked around and opened his mouth.A really, really huge number of people were dancing to the music.\u00a0Besides, all of them were handsome and pretty people, so he was hesitant to think that he could be confident in a place like this.\u201cAre you going to dance?\u201d\u201cDa, dance?\u201d\u201cAre you going to come to the club and just sit there?\u201dIn fact, Inseop thought he was really lucky to have a place to sit in the club.\u00a0He did not know that Lee Wooyeon had reserved the vvip room, which was an independent space on the stage.\u201cI\u2019m going to have a drink and go out.\u201dLee Wooyeon picked up the bottle that was on the table and filled Inseop\u2019s cup.\u00a0Inseop took it without a word and drank it at once.\u00a0He felt like he was getting drunk with just one drink, but he didn\u2019t have the courage to go out on stage and dance.\u201cWould you like another drink?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dSo he drank a few more glasses.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was just smiling while leaning on the sofa to watch what Inseop was doing.Choi Inseop felt very burdened at this moment.\u00a0It was because he thought that he would never go with Lee Wooyeon to a private place until he quit his job.He didn\u2019t even want to have a cup of tea together, but he went to a Saturday night club.\u00a0If this was a game, today\u2019s work was definitely the worst move.\u201cWould you like to go out together?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I need to go to the bathroom\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop got up from his seat and ran out of the room as if running away.\u00a0He came out to get some air, but the sound of music was so loud that it shook his head and the crowds of people seemed to be distracting him again.Besides, no matter how much he looked around, he couldn\u2019t find where the bathroom was, so he had to look around for a long time.\u00a0Then someone tapped him on the shoulder.<What\u2019s the matter?\u00a0Can I help you?>A handsome blond man with a piercing near his eyebrows asked.\u00a0Inseop was happy and asked where the bathroom was.\u00a0The man motioned for him to follow him.As he went to the bathroom, the foreigner constantly questioned Inseop.\u00a0Did you come alone, where did you come from, your English pronunciation is good, where did you learn it, what are you going to do here today?Inseop was careful not to bump into people, and answered diligently.\u00a0There were a lot of people in front of the toilet, so he had to wait in line.\u00a0The foreigner who guided him was also standing next to him, so Choi Inseop set aside a seat thinking he also had to go.\u201cIs this your first time coming to a club?\u201dAt the man\u2019s question, Inseop was taken aback for a moment.\u00a0Perhaps there was a club courtesy that he was not aware of?<Why are you asking such a question?><No, I was just guessing.\u00a0You really look very naive.>He wasn\u2019t sure if it was a compliment to come to the club and to be told that he was naive, but Inseop said thank you.\u00a0Even when he came out of the bathroom, the man did not leave Inseop\u2019s side.<Would you like to go dancing together?\u00a0It\u2019s completely dead here.><I have a party\u2026><Woman?\u00a0Man?><It\u2019s a man.>He smiled with the expression that he knew he would say that.\u00a0He wrapped his arms around Inseop\u2019s and dragged him towards the stairs.<I have to go over there\u2026><Let\u2019s go.\u00a0I will introduce you to my friends.><No, I have a party\u2026><Who takes care of a partner in a place like this? Let\u2019s go have fun..\u00a0I\u2019ll make it super fun.>Inseop panicked and tried to shake off the man\u2019s hand, but the drunk man was strong.\u00a0He dragged Inseop and took him to the room he was in.When he opened the door and entered, the women and men were entangled with one another, creating an uncomfortable sight.Choi Inseop was startled and without realizing it, he shouted, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and closed the door.\u00a0The man standing next to him laughed.\u00a0When he opened the door again, the people inside turned their heads in their direction.<Tony, what is it?\u00a0Who is that innocent-looking kid?><My friend.>Almost all the people in the room were foreigners.\u00a0There were also some Korean women, but they all spoke English naturally.<I\u2019ll introduce you.\u00a0What was your name?>In the first place, the two did not even exchange names.\u00a0After thinking about what to do, Inseop replied, <Peter><Okay.\u00a0This is Peter.\u00a0Over there, Rick, Kevin, Jack, and Keith.>The men raised their hands one by one and said hello. Of course, most people raised their hands without turning their heads while kissing a woman.<I am Tony.\u00a0The boss of these damn cool bastards.><\u2026\u00a0Yes.><Tony, he\u2019s about to cry, the little boy.\u00a0Aren\u2019t you supposed to send him home?><Leave him alone, it\u2019s just Tony\u2019s taste.>Inseop sighed.Why did he have to come to the club and get bullied?<Don\u2019t worry about what these bastards say.\u00a0Let\u2019s drink and dance together.><No, I have someone, so I have to go back.><Wah, that\u2019s really frustrating.\u00a0Who comes with a partner to a place like this? It\u2019s more fun to play with people you don\u2019t know.><Not a partner\u2026\u00a0It\u2019s someone I work with.><Are you the boss at work?\u00a0I\u2019m their boss too, and I don\u2019t care.\u00a0Are you going to get a bonus because you look good to the boss?>Inseop lowered his head for a moment at the expression that he could see well.\u00a0As this man said\u00a0there was no reason to be good to Lee Wooyeon .\u00a0It was better to get out of his sight and get fired sooner rather than later.<I like you.\u00a0Let\u2019s drink together.>Tony cheered and went up to the table and brought a bottle of alcohol.\u00a0Pouring the beer into a glass full of spirits, he motioned for him to drink.\u201cIf I drink this, I will get drunk\u2026\u201dAs Inseop muttered to himself, Tony grabbed his arm and lifted it up so he could drink quickly.\u00a0One of the things Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t like was irresponsible behavior.\u00a0How irresponsible would he look if he went to the bathroom and played with people in a place like this?\u00a0Inseop closed his eyes and brought his mouth to the glass.He had already drunk several glasses of alcohol Lee Wooyeon gave him, so when he drank another glass, he got so drunk that his head went round and round.\u00a0As he emptied his glass and handed it to Tony, the crowd clapped and shouted.<Is it hotter than it looks?><Is that so\u2026>Feeling dizzy while talking, Inseop stumbled for a moment.\u00a0Tony grabbed him and grinned.<Are you doing this to eat him today?><Boss, you had a lot of fun today.>Even the booing of his friends sitting there didn\u2019t come into Inseop\u2019s head.<Shall we go dance together?><I can\u2019t dance\u2026><I will teach you.>Tony grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand and moved his body to the rhythm.\u00a0Standing slumped, Inseop did the best he could do to keep his body balanced so as not to fall to the floor.\u00a0After falling over several times in Tony\u2019s arms, he hugged Inseop and started dancing.At this point, can he say that was acting irresponsibly?Inseop raised his head and looked up at the man who was holding him and dancing like crazy.<You are cute.>When their eyes met, Tony raised his eyebrows.<What?><You\u2019re really cute.\u00a0How is it?\u00a0Good mood?\u00a0Is it fun?>To be honest, he didn\u2019t feel very good.\u00a0The sound of the song was so loud that it felt like his brain was ringing and his stomach felt nauseous.\u00a0He just wanted to lie down somewhere and sleep.<Isn\u2019t it amazing?>When Inseop frowned slightly and didn\u2019t answer, Tony rummaged through his pocket and pulled out a small pill and shoved it in.<Do you want me to make you feel better?><What?><It\u2019s not dangerous.\u00a0It\u2019s not addictive, it\u2019s just going to help you relax.>Inseop quickly shook his head.<No, I don\u2019t do drugs.><But it\u2019s not a dangerous drug.><It\u2019s okay.\u00a0I just\u2026 I\u2019ll go back.><Okay okay.\u00a0I won\u2019t force you.\u00a0Okay?>Tony raised his hands and reassured Inseop.\u00a0He put the pill in his mouth and drank from the bottle of water, and then he smiled.<It\u2019s just like a cold medicine.\u00a0Something like eating to relax before an exam.\u00a0How do you say that in Korea?>A woman sitting on the lap of a black man in the corner and kissing passionately replied, \u201cWoo Hwang Chung Sim Won.\u201d<Did you hear it?\u00a0Woo Hang\u2026\u00a0anyway, it\u2019s something like that>Inseop didn\u2019t know what that was, but he was vigilant enough to not take medicine from someone he didn\u2019t know.<I\u2019ll just leave.><Why?\u00a0It\u2019s getting more fun.\u00a0Let\u2019s go to the stage and dance together.><No.\u00a0Now just\u2026 I\u2019ll go.><Really?\u00a0Then I have something to tell you.>Tony motioned for Inseop to come closer.\u00a0Before going, Inseop put his face in front of him, wanting not to ruin the atmosphere.\u00a0A large hand grabbed Inseop\u2019s back and pulled him straight.\u00a0Then, his lips parted and something slipped inside.\u00a0It happened so quickly that Inseop didn\u2019t even realize what kind of situation he was in.Only after the saliva and the small pill that had entered his mouth passed into his throat did Tony open his mouth and back off.<Now, Now\u2026\u00a0what did you do!><It\u2019ll really make you feel really good.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry.><Tony you bitch. You\u2019re pathetic.\u00a0Peter don\u2019t be like that. Have fun with Tony today.\u00a0Our boss has a lot of money, and he treats his woman well.>Inseop\u2019s face flushed hot.\u00a0It was then that he realized why Tony had brought him into this room.He pushed Tony away and opened the door.\u00a0Tony ran from behind and hugged Inseop tightly.<Let\u2019s go dance together.><I don\u2019t like it!><Tony, I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I don\u2019t like it, so let me go.><You\u2019re cute.\u00a0I want to leave the club together with you today.>Inseop struggled to push him away.<Hahaha.\u00a0You\u2019re good at dancing, yes, let\u2019s go out and dance like this.><I don\u2019t like it\u2026\u00a0!>Just then, the door swung open, and a woman\u2019s scream flowed into the room.\u00a0The eyes of the people in the room turned to the man standing in front of the door.\u201cWhat?\u00a0Isn\u2019t that Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cI wonder why Lee Wooyeon is here\u2026\u00a0oh my, are you really Lee Wooyeon?\u201dThe women in the room were startled and stood up.Lee Wooyeon, who found Choi Inseop, frowned for a moment and then clicked his tongue.\u00a0Before Inseop could say anything, he reached out and hugged Inseop\u2019s shoulder, giving him strength.\u00a0It was when Inseop realized that he was in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms, his soft voice echoed from above.\u201cI was looking for my manager and he was here.\u201dTony, who had suddenly been deprived of the person he was with, looked at Lee Wooyeon, and who he was.\u201cMr. Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Did you come here to play?\u201d\u201cWould you like to join us?\u201dThe women who got up from their seats surrounded him and spoke in a charming voice.\u201cI\u2019d love to, but I think I should get going.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled, apologized and bowed his head politely.\u00a0As Inseop staggered and was about to fall, Lee Wooyeon grabbed him by the waist and hugged him tightly.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 ah, a little, yes.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201dAs he answered, Inseop frowned.\u00a0It looked like he was getting drunk.<You\u2019re Peter\u2019s boss.><Tony, that person is an actor, not the boss.\u00a0Have you never seen him?><Should I know?\u00a0If I don\u2019t know you, you\u2019re not a very famous actor, don\u2019t you think?>As Tony frowned when he looked at Lee Wooyeon, the women took the side of Lee Wooyeon<What are you talking about?\u00a0He is the most famous actor in Korea.><Tony, if you say something like that, you will be stoned.>Tony stood up crookedly and glared at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon just smiled and shook his head.\u201cWe\u2019ll just go.\u201dAs he was about to leave, Tony grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.<He decided to play with me.\u00a0Leave him.>Ha.\u00a0fuck, this fucking bastard.Lee Wooyeon swallowed his anger and kept smiling.\u00a0Too many eyes were on him.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t a place to properly get angry.He ignored the blonde piercing and lightly tapped Inseop\u2019s face with the back of his hand.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Wake up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u201dInseop staggered and clung to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body.\u00a0Tony grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm and lowered his head.<Hey, Peter.\u00a0You said you were going to get out of here with me today.\u00a0Right?\u00a0Answer me.><\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m leaving..>As a clear English answer came out of Inseop\u2019s mouth, Lee Wooyeon opened his eyes wide and looked at him.<Did you say you were going with me?\u00a0Would you like to leave your boss and come join my company?\u00a0If it were you, I think I could give you a huge salary.>Tony persistently grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm and groaned.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon barely resisted the urge to grab hold of the blonde hair and smashed it on the table.\u201cSince he\u2019s with me, I\u2019ll take him with me.\u201dLee Wooyeon pretended not to hear Tony and tried to take Inseop out.\u00a0Tony blocked them again.<People are talking, but why are you just going out?>\u201c\u2026\u00a0Fuck.\u201d<What?\u00a0Didn\u2019t this son of a bitch just curse right now?>Tony pointed at Lee Wooyeon and shouted.\u00a0The people who couldn\u2019t hear Lee Wooyeon\u2019s murmuring because of the loud music had confused expressions on their faces.<Tony, he\u2019s not that kind of person.><Don\u2019t fight and just get out of the way.>The entire 3rd floor was a vvip room.\u00a0Money was money, but even if one tries to make a reservation, it was a space that you could not enter unless the MD of the club gave you a recommendation.\u00a0In other words, it was the same as saying that if there was a problem, it would be difficult to enter again.<Did you curse at me now?\u00a0Do you think I can\u2019t understand Korean?>Lee Wooyeon supported Inseop\u2019s body and focused on getting him up no matter what Tony said.<Tell me.\u00a0Hey, you bastard.>Tony hit Lee Wooyeon on the shoulder with his palm.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smiling expression hardened.\u00a0The only person who saw his fists clenching was Inseop, who was hanging from his waist.\u201cNo!\u201dChoi Inseop spread his hands out to the sides, blocking the space between them.\u00a0And with a very serious face, he poured out English like a rapid-fire gun at Tony.<I\u2019m not going out with you.\u00a0I\u2019m not a woman, and I won\u2019t go to your company.\u00a0I don\u2019t even want to dance!\u00a0And ah\u2026>Inseop, who had spoken up to that point, frowned and bit his lip.<And, what?>When Tony rushed him to say the next word, Inseop trembled and barely continued the next word.\u201cI don\u2019t feel good\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dAs soon as those words were said, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand hugged Inseop\u2019s waist and ran out as if supporting him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was not that he hated it when he was smiling like a fool, but he thought something was wrong.Lee Wooyeon stopped his car on a quiet street.\u201cHave you eaten anything other than alcohol?\u201dWhen Choi Inseop, who was going to the bathroom, did not return, Lee Wooyeon got up from his seat just in case.\u00a0He remembered the incident in the break room and searched the bathroom thoroughly.\u00a0He still couldn\u2019t find him, so he went to search from the 3rd floor first, so he knocked on the vvip rooms one by one and opened the door to enter.Eventually, in the fifth room, he found Inseop struggling in the arms of a man.\u00a0Seeing that scene, Lee Wooyeon was able to know exactly what emotion he was feeling this time.He was really angry.Even a passing dog would have the ability to learn more than that. Fuck, what\u2019s the point of saving him? Every time he took his eyes off of him, he was caught by perverts.The guys who were with Inseop were the kind of people who wanted to brag about money at the club and flirt with women for one night.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was barely enduring the desire to cut the throat of Inseop, who followed a stranger in the club without any hesitation.Lee Wooyeon shook Inseop\u2019s shoulder and asked again affectionately.\u201cWhat did that bastard feed Inseop?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u00a0Is it Woo Wang cheong?\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0I said I didn\u2019t want to eat it, but I just forced it in\u2026\u00a0Ah, uhg.\u201dAs if Inseop remembered the situation, he rubbed his lips with his sleeve.\u00a0With that single action, Lee Wooyeon could guess what happened to Inseop in that room.\u201cDid he feed it by mouth?\u00a0Forcibly?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dNormally, he would have blushed and could not have answered properly, but Inseop nodded without hesitation.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed his chin and smiled slowly.\u201cThen if I die, don\u2019t give me artificial respiration and just leave me. All right? Do you understand?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t give me artificial respiration with your mouth that was all over the place.\u201dAfter hesitating for a moment, Inseop blinked his eyes a couple of times and shook his head.\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cPeople dying\u2026\u00a0How can I leave it alone?\u201d\u201cLeave it.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t let it go.\u201d\u201cLeave it.\u201d:No, I don\u2019t want to!\u201dInseop groaned.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s head was pounding, wondering what the heck that bastard fed this bastard.\u00a0He was filled with regrets for not punching a hole in his head with a fork, whether people saw it or not.\u201cNo, I do not want to!\u00a0No, I don\u2019t want to!\u00a0I will save you.\u00a0I will save you many times.\u00a0Can\u2019t I just do that one thing on my own terms?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cBecause I conceded everything else\u2026\u00a0As far as saving lives, let me do whatever I want.\u201dLee Wooyeon reached out and touched Inseop\u2019s forehead.\u00a0His fever was rising, it looked like he had been given a drug containing a stimulant.\u00a0Originally, he was a weak person, but he ate a mixture of stimulants and alcohol, so it was not unreasonable to talk nonsense.\u201cCan\u2019t you see anything in vain?\u201dInseop answered Lee Wooyeon\u2019s question, looking blankly at his face.\u201cNo, it feels good.\u00a0Really good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat bastard saying awesome was really going to freeze to death.\u201cOh, it\u2019s hot.\u201dInseop unfastened his seat belt and opened the car door.\u201cChoi In\u2026\u00a0, Hey!\u201dWhether Lee Wooyeon called or not, Inseop went outside and started running.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon got out of the car, wondering if there was anything else.\u201cMr. Inseop!\u00a0Hey!\u00a0Choi Inseop!\u201d\u201cWow!\u00a0I can run!\u00a0yahoo.\u201dWhat made running so good that Inseop was excited like a child and sprinted toward the park?\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was watching him from behind, bit his lips, closed the car door and started running after him.\u00a0Not long after, Inseop was grabbed by Lee Wooyeon by the hair and fell backwards.\u201cAh!\u201dChoi Inseop screamed and clapped his hands together.\u00a0Recalling his finger, Lee Wooyeon swallowed a curse and wrapped his arms around Inseop\u2019s shoulder.The two of them fell on the lawn with their bodies stacked on top of each other.\u00a0Inseop, who would normally be trembling that he was sorry, smiled and placed his face on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body.\u201cWide.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is very wide. Shoulder.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dIt was a very quiet park, so they were lucky that no one was passing by.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon did not hide his irritation, and grabbed Inseop\u2019s shoulder and forced him to stand up.\u201cWait.\u00a0Wait a minute!\u00a0I have something to say.\u201dHe was drunk on drugs and alcohol, and his manner of speaking was a mess, and his tone of voice was different from usual, and he was young and cute.\u00a0\u2019What is it?\u2019 Lee Wooyeon replied.\u201cThere is something.\u00a0May I ask you one thing?\u201dAs Inseop asked in a voice like a child with a cotton candy in his hand, Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t return the answer, \u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cAsk.\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to sign a three-year contract with me?\u201d\u201cBecause, of course\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s big eyes looked at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t just a glance or a slight turning of the gaze as usual, but a gaze that looked at everything as it was.For that moment, Lee Wooyeon thought that Inseop would not believe whatever lie he told.\u00a0The smile was lifted from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face.\u201cI don\u2019t know what your intentions are, but I don\u2019t want Inseop to stab me in the back.\u201dAt first, he couldn\u2019t understand his intention, so he decided to keep him by his side and watch.\u00a0But as he watched, he was intrigued.\u00a0What is it really?In addition, an asshole like him risked his life to save him.\u00a0An ordinary person would have been impressed, but he was not an ordinary person, but here the fun was added.\u00a0There was also greed.\u00a0If it was Choi Inseop, even if he showed his real face, wouldn\u2019t he be quiet next to him?\u00a0He didn\u2019t know what Choi Inseop wanted from him, but he also wished that he would never find it..This was the most honest answer Lee Wooyeon could give now.However, Inseop\u2019s expression wrinkled upon hearing the answer.\u00a0It looked like he was laughing and he looked like he was going to burst into tears at any moment.\u201cI\u2026 do you believe it?\u201d\u201cIs there any reason not to believe it?\u201dThe question was returned with a question.\u00a0Tears welled up in Choi Inseop\u2019s eyes.\u00a0Seeing the face of Inseop crying silently with only tears flowing, Wooyeon clenched his mouth.It was really weird too.\u00a0If an unpretty face cried, they would look uglier, but he looked so pretty.Lee Wooyeon watched Inseop\u2019s crying face without even thinking of wiping the tears away.\u00a0Seeing Inseop wiping away his tears after crying for a while, Lee Wooyeon patted him on the waist and said:\u201cAre you crying?\u00a0Let\u2019s go now\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dChoi Inseop suddenly grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s neck.\u00a0At the sudden action of Choi Inseop, who flinched even when he touched his fingertips, Lee Wooyeon was at a loss as to how to react.Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t like the act of hugging.\u00a0The only time he could hug a woman\u2019s body was when he was acting or having sex.\u00a0Because he didn\u2019t know what it felt like to be comforted by the warmth the other person gave, the warmth of a person only gave him a synergistic effect, but nothing more.\u00a0It was a chilly early spring night, and the warmth of Inseop hugging him was felt..\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was easy to remove Inseop.\u00a0It was because he was holding him with such a small force that he could throw him away with just a little force on his hand.But he had no intention of forcibly removing him.\u00a0A small warmth embraced him with all his might.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop on the back with his palm, thinking that he was doing something unusual today.\u201cHave you stopped crying now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInseop nodded his head.\u00a0Tears streamed down his chin as he moved his face.\u00a0Choi Inseop said with a wide smile with a crying face.\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re a bad guy.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad\u2026why can\u2019t I give up\u2026 \u00a0I want to give up and pretend not to know\u2026 Why\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2026!\u201dLee Wooyeon was a person who was not surprised by anything.\u00a0Surprise was a category of human emotions.\u00a0At first his parents were proud of their overly calm son, but later they became increasingly burdened.\u00a0However, he couldn\u2019t force himself to pretend he was surprised, so he always maintained his coolness disguised as calm in everything.\u00a0But this time, he was definitely surprised.\u00a0He was feeling the emotions that fit the word, amazing, enough to count in his hand over the course of his life.Choi Inseop was kissing him, his timid manager who hesitated and looked nervously at people.\u00a0It was a kiss while desperately hanging on like a person hanging from a cliff, but it was clumsy like a child.Lee Wooyeon, who was dazed for a moment at the boring kiss that didn\u2019t even involve\u00a0 tongue, grabbed Inseop\u2019s hair with his hand. When Inseop was pulled off with strength, Inseop looked down at Lee Wooyeon, terrified, like a child caught doing something bad. The moment he saw the scared and cringed figure, Lee Wooyeon felt a heavy displeasure in his heart.Why was he looking at him like that after he did that first? It pissed him off.Lee Wooyeon let out a low swear word and hugged Inseop\u2019s head again. He forced his lips to open and put his tongue in. He felt Inseop\u2019s body harden. As the kiss deepened, Inseop struggled and tried to pull himself back. The more he did, the more Lee Wooyeon held him in his hand, making it impossible to move away.Lee Wooyeon did not feel much interest in the act itself. Why did he need to force himself? Women spread their legs. Among the guys he was working out with, there was a guy who said he wouldn\u2019t get excited if he didn\u2019t force them. It was purely because of Choi Inseop\u2019s reaction that he suddenly remembered the words of the guy who bragged about how awesome it was when he binds his girlfriend\u2019s wrist and inserts it. Whenever he touched his lips, he was stubbornly rejecting it like a virgin who would be violated.As Inseop struggled with his strength, he felt strangely better.\u00a0With the intention of trying it one more time, Lee Wooyeon scoured Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u00a0Sucking up his dry tongue and lips, he grabbed Inseop\u2019s slender neck so he couldn\u2019t even move his head.\u00a0It looked like it could be broken with just a little bit of force of his hand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and gave strength to his hand.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s breathing became more and more difficult as he was choking.\u00a0As the power gradually drained from Choi Inseop\u2019s body, a body that fit perfectly in his grasp came to him as if sagging.\u00a0At that moment, a human change came to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body.Sexual desire.For others, it may be a desire close to instinct, but for Lee Wooyeon, even that was a feeling close to emotion.Lee Wooyeon laid Choi Inseop\u2019s body down, and he climbed up and kissed him in earnest.\u00a0With Inseop, whose eyes were red and bloodshot, and panting while crying, he felt a very human sexual desire.Just as Lee Wooyeon was about to feel a little more humane, Inseop, who was breathing heavily, raised his head, kissed Lee Wooyeon on the cheek, and whispered a small word.\u00a0And then he just lost his consciousness.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body became cold at that moment.\u00a0It felt like he was drenched in cold water.Lee Wooyeon quietly mumbled the words Inseop whispered to him.He said\u2026 Good bye\u2026\u00a0Phillip.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a simple and formal question, such as what happened that day and when they broke up. Lee Wooyeon was also there, so he was questioned by the police, but someone took a picture of the scene, and posted an article with the title, \u201cThe atmosphere of Lee Wooyeon and Kang Youngmo\u2019s filming site was unusual.\u201d Of course, that someone was reporter Kim Haeshin. She was personally showing the most painful example of a reporter becoming an anti-celebrity.Because of the article posted on the Internet by reporter Kim Haeshin, Lee Wooyeon, who had no anti\u2019s, was also criticized for a while.\u00a0It was like he knew it would happen, and people who pretend not to know like that were scary.Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t care that it was a story without evidence, even if it lasted for three days, but Inseop, who had the evidence, got cold sweats on his hands.\u00a0He was worried as if he had injured Kang Youngmo.\u201cI guess it\u2019s not time for him to come out yet?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dEven though it was almost time, Inseop answered that way.\u00a0Reporter Kim Haeshin smiled and nodded.\u201cYeah, let\u2019s have a cup of coffee nearby and wait, okay?\u00a0I only have time left. Oh, right. You know what? I was suspended.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere was pressure from above.\u00a0It\u2019s too bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dChoi Inseop recalled the words of Chief Cha, who said that even though CEO Kim seems sloppy, he has a wide network of people, so he is sure to protect the entertainers who belong to him.\u201cSo sooner or later, I\u2019m going to do something loud and go back screaming.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u00a0do your best.\u201dInseop nodded his head.\u00a0Because he didn\u2019t feel the need to talk to her anymore.\u00a0She, who was looking at Inseop, asked with a strange smile.\u201cBy the way, is Inseop leaving the job of a manager?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cWhy did you book a plane ticket?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cTo go to America, next weekend, ah, what was the exact flight number?\u201dShe blurted out her words, pretending that she didn\u2019t remember.\u00a0The blood drained from Choi Inseop\u2019s face.\u00a0He had no idea how much she knew.\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026I do not know.\u201dInseop turned his gaze and responded calmly.\u00a0Cold sweat dripped from his hands and he hid them behind his back.\u201cRemember Blue\u2019s Yoon Ahreum?\u201dIn Inseop\u2019s memory, the face of a reporter with neat short hair came to mind.\u201cShe\u2019s my school mate.\u00a0I heard that she had exchanged phone numbers with Inseop before, so I asked for it too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs a manager, his phone number wasn\u2019t particularly secretive, but he didn\u2019t feel good .\u201cDo you know what a copy phone is?\u201d\u201c\u2026I know.\u201dIn order to dig into the private lives of the celebrities they are pursuing, some polarized fans illegally copy their cell phones and secretly spy on them for text messages and phone calls.\u00a0Inseop also knew that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cell phone number was impossible to get because CEO Kim had changed the name in a complicated way.In the end, reporter Kim Haeshin illegally copied the manager Inseop\u2019s cell phone to find out Lee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule and private life.\u201cThat is illegal.\u201d\u201cWho said that?\u00a0I was just telling you that there is such a thing.\u00a0By the way, the cell phone that Inseop is using now is a cannon phone.\u00a0The owner came out under a completely different name, what happened?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop bought his number under the name he bought on the Internet to prevent unforeseen events.\u00a0Later, when the person named Choi Inseop disappeared, it was a choice he made so that he could not find his whereabouts.It is unknown how reporter Kim Haeshin found out about this fact, but it was very unpleasant and uncomfortable for him.\u201cYou seem to have more secrets than you look.\u00a0But, seeing that you only got a one-way ticket to the United States next week, you must have quit your job.\u201d\u201cIt is not a matter for journalists to worry about.\u201dThinking that only he would get tired if they talked, Inseop bowed his head to avoid her and said goodbye.\u00a0Reporter Kim Haeshin asked Inseop as he was about to walk away to the car.\u201cMr. Inseop, you agreed to have an interview with me before writing your resignation.\u201d\u201cI never promised anything like that.\u201dAfter answering in a rage, Inseop realized his mistake.\u00a0Inseop was not strong enough to face her, who had thick bones in the entertainment club.\u2018Let\u2019s ignore it, ignoring is the best.\u2019Inseop moved quickly again.\u201cBy the way, does Lee Wooyeon know that Inseop is quitting his job?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cDoes CEO Kim Hakseung know?\u00a0The last time I met him, I asked him, and he didn\u2019t say anything like that.\u201d\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u2026\u201dInseop saw Lee Wooyeon coming down from the elevator in the distance and shut his mouth.\u00a0Reporter Kim Haeshin also moved her head following his gaze and smiled, saying, \u201cAha.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s a secret that Inseop is going to America next week.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dThere should have been a clear counter-attack there, but Inseop couldn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0It was true.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter that he had to quit his job somehow, but he never wanted to be found out about going back to the US.\u00a0He wanted to prevent any suspicion that the person who provided the information was Choi Inseop.When Inseop opened his eyes and lifted his head, Lee Wooyeon was already close to him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon found reporter Kim Haeshin and greeted her by saying hello.\u201cI can\u2019t greet you back.\u00a0Mr. Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Did you know I was suspended?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u00a0It must be hard.\u201dHe softly offered words of consolation, but Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes were not smiling at all.\u00a0There was no way he would be happy when a reporter showed up wherever he went, took pictures, and wrote delusional articles.\u201cI\u2019m going to make a big hit soon.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I hope so.\u00a0Then, I\u2019ll be leaving.\u201dLee Wooyeon bowed his head politely and passed by reporter Kim Haeshin.\u00a0He beckoned Inseop to get to the car quickly.It was then-\u201cLee Wooyeon, did you also know about it?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dReporter Kim Haeshin said while looking at Inseop, who was standing behind Lee Wooyeon\u2019s back with a pale face.\u00a0Choi Inseop bowed his head.\u00a0There could be situations where he cannot go to the United States even with evidence.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to do even the slightest bit of harm to the person he had borrowed his name from.\u201cMr. Kang Youngmo.\u00a0They said his condition has improved a lot.\u00a0Just go to the hospital.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I was going to do that anyway, but thanks for letting me know.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t listen to the next words, and gestured to Inseop to get into the car quickly.\u00a0Reporter Kim Haeshin frowned at Inseop, and signed at him with her hand to give her a call.Inseop walked out and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat of the van.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who entered the car afterward, sighed.\u00a0A tired look was evident.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you talking to reporter Kim Haeshin?\u201dExcept for the two words in the morning, it was the first time Lee Wooyeon had spoken to him.\u00a0He wanted to give him a long answer, but he didn\u2019t think it would be okay, so Inseop said it was no big deal.\u201cI\u2019ll decide whether it\u2019s a big deal or not.\u00a0Please tell me what you were talking about.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s words were particularly sharp.\u201cShe just asked about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule, and I answered that I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThe first thing that caught Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes when he was walking from a distance was not the sickening leech-like reporter, but the white face of the manager.\u201cIf possible, do not contact reporter Kim Haeshin.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t she say you should call her earlier?\u201dLee Wooyeon seemed to have noticed that reporter Kim Haeshin was beckoning from behind.\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dAt first, he had no choice but to answer.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon nodded and leaned back on the seat.\u00a0As they exited the parking lot and entered the city, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cell phone rang.\u201cYes.\u00a0This is Lee Wooyeon.\u201dIt was a clear, low-pitched sound.\u00a0Inseop slowly moved the steering wheel, thinking that the day would not be long before he would hear that voice in person.\u201cOkay.\u00a0Yes\u2026 That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u00a0I want acceptable results.\u00a0Yes, please contact me again.\u00a0As soon as possible.\u201dAfter the call, Lee Wooyeon closed his eyes with a sigh of exhaustion.Choi Inseop suddenly remembered the words of CEO Kim, who said that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s blood is made of Bacchus and never gets tired.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know what Bacchus was, so he searched the internet later to find it, but he laughed for a while by himself.\u00a0That is why Lee Wooyeon had good physical strength.\u00a0Even if the person he was following was hard on him, he never showed any signs of that.But today, he didn\u2019t look particularly good.\u00a0His mood seemed very bad.\u00a0In such a case, if he played the 23 club songs that he had carefully selected, he may be fired on the spot.After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Choi Inseop took out a CD containing the quietest songs among Lee Wooyeon\u2019s favorite songs and put it into the audio.\u00a0A waltz by Shostakovich.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who had closed his eyes until then, raised his eyelids slowly and pulled the tip of his lips together.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop, really\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop, who was holding the steering wheel, waited impatiently for the next word.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon smiled and closed his eyes again.\u00a0Inside the moving car, the sound of quiet music continued like a dance.Inseop stepped on the accelerator, thinking in vain, wishing that the road he was taking would not end.\u201cI left for a while\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was opening the passenger\u2019s car door, paused and shut his mouth.\u00a0When he went up for a while, Inseop was asleep.\u00a0Seeing him curled up and sleeping, he thought that he must have been very tired.Lee Wooyeon sat in the passenger seat and closed the car door, making as little noise as possible.\u00a0He was thinking of picking up the documents he handed Inseop earlier and looking for them myself.Perhaps because of the sound of the car door closing, Inseop made a small moan and tossed and turned.\u00a0At that moment, the body odor mixed with the smell of Inseop\u2019s sweat spread.\u00a0It was a sweet smell, like a child with a high body temperature.Lee Wooyeon, who reached out to search the glove box, turned to Inseop.As he looked at his slightly chapped lips, he naturally remembered what happened yesterday.Yesterday;s event was a simple accident.It was done out of a rush because of the fever when the reckless manager rushed at him to see if his head was spinning.\u00a0He concluded that the human change in his body was due to starvation for various reasons.But was he really that hungry?Looking at the face of the manager who was a billion light years away from his taste, skinny, too gentle, and even a little rustic, Lee Wooyeon thought such a thing.But with a face like that, panting from below, and being held in his arms, he was in awe.Inseop tossed and frowned again.\u00a0It felt a lot more emaciated than when he first saw it.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon reached out and gently brushed Inseop\u2019s hair up.\u00a0Feeling itchy, Inseop wrinkled his nose and wiped his mouth.Lee Wooyeon suddenly had a thought that he wanted to shove something down into his lips.\u201cCrazy\u2026\u201dHe swallowed a laugh and clicked his tongue.\u00a0He must\u2019ve been starving for too long.Lee Wooyeon, who found the documents in the glove box, got out of the car and called the person who he asked for an investigation earlier.\u00a0He hung up after receiving a reply that by tomorrow morning he would be able to send him the correct material.Waiting for the elevator to come down in front of the elevator door, he made another call.\u00a0Then he whispered sweet words to a suitable opponent who could relieve the repulsion of his lower limbs.Previous Chapter<All

Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201dAs he entered the room, Inseop muttered to himself.\u00a0The only thing waiting for him in the empty space was the dark stillness, but he wanted to breathe life into it even if it was like this.The first thing he did when he turned on the light and went inside was to wash his hands and feet.\u00a0Inseop, who changed clothes and sat in front of the desk, organized what he had done today in his notebook.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t have to find out about Lee Wooyeon anymore, but it was a habit he got, so he scribbled it down mechanically and closed the notebook.\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201dChoi Inseop was lying on the floor and muttered.He felt like his whole body had run out of energy because he was watching Lee Wooyeon all day today.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was consistent throughout the day with a cold attitude.\u00a0Even if he bought bread for him, he took a bite and threw it away, took a sip but said the coffee didn\u2019t taste good, and even threw it in the trash.\u00a0It was such a transformation that he wondered if it was someone other than Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0It seemed like something had happened after leaving the club, but he couldn;t ask Lee Wooyeon about it.The events of yesterday that he couldn\u2019t remember weighed heavily on Inseop\u2019s heart.Rather, it would be better to say, \u201cShut up, you did crazy things to me yesterday among other things.\u201dInseop turned his head to the flowerpot in the corner of the room and spoke.\u201cKate.\u00a0There are not many days left to see you now.\u201dOne of the things he had to clean up after leaving Seoul was Kate.\u00a0Inseop went to the flower shop where he bought Kate and said that he would return the flowerpot.\u00a0The owner of the flower shop was confused, but Inseop said that he would pay for the cost of arranging and nutritional supplements that would occur in the future, so he allowed him to do it with a sullen face.\u201cLee Wooyeon\u2026 You hit Young-mo Kang.\u201dEven as he said that, Inseop lowered his voice as much as possible so that no one would hear him.\u201cSo Kang Youngmo is still in the hospital.\u00a0He had to lie in bed for a while.\u00a0Fortunately, nothing went wrong, but \u2026 Lee\u00a0Wooyeon did that.\u00a0Only I know that Lee Wooyeon did it.\u201dAt first, when he took a picture of Lee Wooyeon coming out of the alley, Inseop thought he had a chance not to go back to him.\u00a0However, the secret grew heavier as time went on and weighed on Inseop.\u201cI thought everything would be clear if I had Lee Wooyeon\u2019s weakness, but it\u2019s even more frustrating.\u201dInseop realized that he was more deeply attached to Lee Wooyeon than he had thought.\u201cWhat should I do?\u00a0What should I do?\u201dHe asked a question, but no answer came back.Inseop lightly stroked his face with the palm of his hand.He had to hold on to his weak heart.\u00a0Only the most important ending of the waiting moment remained.\u00a0If the word dismissal does not come out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth by next Wednesday, he can use the excuse that he is not feeling well and write his resignation letter.Anyway, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager changes once every three months, so even if he left, no one will care.Even though there was a clear blueprint for the future, Inseop was still confused.\u00a0Inseop, who was fiddling with Kate\u2019s flowerpot with his fingertips, checked his watch and stood up.\u00a0Today was the day he had a phone call with his mother.\u00a0After a few rings, he heard his mother\u2019s voice.<Hello?\u00a0Peter?><Yes.\u00a0What were you doing?><Will was taking a bath, Inseok-ah!\u00a0Where are you running away?>He heard Will barking over the phone.\u00a0The whole living room of the house would be covered in water because of Will running around every time he took a bath.<Tell him yo\u2019ll give him his favorite snack after bathing.><You have to listen.\u00a0Will!\u00a0Stay there.\u00a0Otherwise, I won\u2019t give you snacks.>He heard Will\u2019s loud barking.\u00a0He still seemed to think of bathing as a game.\u00a0In terms of human age, even though he was well over his twenties, Will was always an underdog.\u00a0Inseop, who was smiling, thought that he wanted to hug Will quickly.\u201cMom.\u00a0Next week\u2026 I might come back.\u201dEven after booking the plane ticket, Inseop did not inform his family that he was going back to the United States.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know how things were going to end yet, so he thought he wouldn\u2019t tell them until he got to the airport.\u201cWhat?\u00a0Really?\u00a0Are you really coming back?\u00a0Thank you, God.\u00a0Do you know how much I cried when you appeared in a dream yesterday?\u201dHe heard his mother\u2019s crying voice.\u00a0If he had known that she would like it this much, he guessed he should have told her sooner.\u201cAre you really coming back?\u00a0What time is the flight?\u00a0Huh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet, so for now, only mother knows.\u00a0I\u2019ll give you more details in a few days.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Okay.\u00a0Are you eating well?\u00a0Are you in pain?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cBy the way, did the work you were trying to do in Korea work out well?\u201dInseop hesitated for a moment at his mother\u2019s voice asking carefully, then answered honestly.\u201cI think it will work out\u2026\u00a0I am not sure.\u201d\u201cWhat certainty?\u201dWhen Inseop said he was going to Korea, it was his mother who opposed him the most at first.\u00a0She was angry and opposed because of the fact that her weak son was leaving for a distant place, and he didn\u2019t explain the reason properly.\u00a0He had to convince his mother to believe in him only once, because Inseop was really going for someone who was so precious.\u00a0But in the end he didn\u2019t tell anyone what it was.\u00a0Except for Jenny, who was no longer in the world.If someone listened to it, they would say that he was crazy, or they could laugh at whether it would be a waste to waste his life on such trivial things.\u00a0But for Inseop, it was the most important issue.<I\u2019m confident that I\u2019m doing the right thing.>Right now, he just wants to step away from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side.\u00a0An ominous feeling that if he stayed by his side even a little longer, he would not be able to control his heavy heart on his own, was slowly growing.<Peter.\u00a0People cannot always do what is right.><\u2026\u00a0\u2026><You just have to do what you want the most.\u00a0Mom believes in you.>Peter\u2019s heart ached at the words that she believed. Wasn\u2019t he trying to sell someone for his redemption here and now with that one word?When no answer came from the son, his mother deliberately continued the conversation in a pleasant voice.<You know that when I\u2019m not in a good mood, I always go out to buy donuts at the 3rd Street store, right?><Yes.\u00a0I know.>His mother, who made donuts, as well as various breads and cookies better than most bakeries, would go to the old store whenever she was stressed and buy donuts that didn\u2019t taste special.<At first, I did it because the donuts were delicious, but in the end, the way I walked to it felt better.><\u2026\u00a0\u2026><I am not obsessed with results.\u00a0Because there are many cases where you find meaning along the way.\u00a0Understand?><\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u00a0Then I will call you back next time.><Okay.\u00a0I hope to see you next week.>A friendly greeting was added and the call was disconnected.\u2018What I want.\u2019What is it?\u00a0Inseop laid on the floor and picked out the things that immediately came to his mind.\u00a0His family, the cookies his mom baked, the books he left on the bookshelf after not reading, Will\u2019s soft paws, the never-ending story with Jenny, and\u2026The cell phone rang.\u00a0He woke up and looked at his phone screen, and three letters of the name Lee Wooyeon struck his heart.Choi Inseop was conflicted.\u00a0He shouldn\u2019t answer the phone.\u00a0He should just say he didn\u2019t know because he was sleeping tomorrow morning.\u00a0Anyway, Lee Wooyeon was the person he had to throw away.\u00a0It was no use trying to be nice to this person anymore\u00a0\u2026\u201c\u2026\u00a0Hello.\u201d\u2026\u00a0no use.\u00a0For a human like him, no matter how much he put his mind to it, it was really useless.Inseop took the call and let out a bitter sigh.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I am listening.\u201dIt was very dangerous to hear Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice over the phone.\u00a0Because the receiver part touched his ear, he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s sweet voice flowing into his ear and fluttering.\u201cHow is your body?\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u00a0It must have been a cheap drug.\u201dInseop\u2019s face flushed as he remembered the memory of yesterday when he was forced to take a drug.\u00a0Until recently, he had made up his mind by muttering that it had nothing to do with Lee Wooyeon, but at every word he said, he felt really pathetic that he was helpless like a teenage girl.\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201dIt was a strange feeling.When they were together just a moment ago, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t say anything kind to him, he just stared at him with ferocious eyes, but what was the reason why he suddenly spoke on the phone with such a soft voice?\u201cI was just.\u201dInseop answered, drawing various pictures on the floor with his fingers.\u201cWhere are you?\u201d\u201cAt home.\u201d\u201cWho are you with?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlthough the tone was friendly, Inseop could hear the sharpness hidden inside and realized that he was being interrogated.\u201cKate?\u201dStartled, he moved his hand and touched Kate\u2019s leaf.\u00a0Kate curled up her leaves like clenched fists.\u201cAre you with Kate?\u201d\u201cWe are together, but\u2026\u201dInseop looked at the flowerpot in front of him and answered.\u201cDid you give her water today?\u201dWhen did he tell Lee Wooyeon that Kate was a plant?\u00a0Did he say something like that while drinking yesterday?Inseop scratched his head and replied with a shy voice.\u00a0There was silence over the phone, followed by laughter.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my life that I have a hard time memorizing a person like Mr. Inseop.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what he was memorizing, but Inseop responded appropriately saying was that so.The sound of flipping papers could be heard over the phone.\u201cAre you reading a book?\u201dIt was a question he could ask because he knew that one of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hobbies was reading.\u201cIt\u2019s not a book, but I was reading something a little more interesting than that.\u00a0For sending it earlier than I thought\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was muffled at the end of his speech, suddenly asked Inseop a question.\u201cIs the job okay?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThese days, is the work okay?\u201dIt was as if a friend was greeting him after a long time.\u00a0Inseop let out a small sigh and answered honestly.\u201cI would be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t difficult, but it\u2019s okay because it\u2019s my choice.\u201dLee Wooyeon replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI think I didn\u2019t know too much about Inseop.\u00a0Again.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThere was no reply to that, and he didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0Just then, a soft moan came from the phone.\u201cWhere are you?\u201dWhen Inseop asked that question, Lee Wooyeon let out a pleasant laugh.\u201cI have a little headache.\u201d\u201cThen take your medicine.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any medicine at home.\u00a0Then I\u2019ll hang up the phone here.\u00a0Don\u2019t forget to use a condom when watering.\u201dThe phone hung up as suddenly as it was when it came in.Choi Inseop, who stared blankly at his phone, sat down in front of the computer as if possessed.\u00a0He was looking for the hidden meaning of the expression \u201cwatering\u201d on the Internet, and within 30 seconds he ripped off his head and stood up.As he climbed up the elevator, Inseop was embarrassed to the point of dying at the glance of the woman he was riding with.\u00a0Tonight, holding a flowerpot and riding in the elevator of a luxury apartment, this guy must want something.Upon arriving on the 49th floor, Inseop got off the elevator and greeted the person who glanced at him.\u00a0Of course, that woman, far from being greeted, quickly pressed the close button and climbed up before Inseop bowed his head.Inseop sighed and turned away.No matter how much he thought about it, Inseop had to bring Kate with him because he thought that Lee Wooyeon was misunderstanding him.Inseop came to the conclusion that Lee Wooyeon was thinking of Kate as a woman after looking up what he meant by giving water.\u00a0What came after the conclusion was a great shame.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t raise his face for a while because he thought that Lee Wooyeon had imagined he was with a woman.No.\u00a0He was not.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t do that.\u201cThis is Kate\u2026\u201dInseop held out the flowerpot and practiced what he was going to say.\u00a0No matter how he said it, it seemed that he could not avoid looking stupid.\u00a0However, it was better to correct the misunderstanding.\u00a0There was nothing, of course.Choi Inseop put Kate on his side and rang the bell.\u00a0The intercom turned on, and after checking his face, he heard the sound of a door opening.Lee Wooyeon was seen through the gap in the open door.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cOh,\u201d and opened his eyes.Lee Wooyeon, wearing only one brief, was standing with his wet hair.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dIt was strange.A different atmosphere from usual was exuded from Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Not knowing exactly what it was, Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon blankly, then rummaged through his pocket and took out the medicine he had bought at the pharmacy.\u201cThis\u2026\u00a0is a pain reliever.\u00a0I didn\u2019t know which one would be better, so I bought several good ones.\u201d\u201cDid you come all the way here because of a headache medicine?\u201d\u201cTomorrow\u2026\u00a0you have a schedule, so it shouldn\u2019t be a hindrance\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop muttered like that and glanced down at Kate, who was held on his side.\u00a0The purpose of coming here was not for headache medicine, but for Kate.\u00a0The misunderstandings needed to be cleared up.\u00a0He should be brave and tell him he was not one of those people\u2026\u201cWho is outside?\u201dAt that moment, a husky female voice was heard from inside.Choi Inseop was startled and almost dropped Kate, which he was holding.\u00a0The woman wore only one slip that exposed her breasts.\u00a0She was an actress he saw a few times on TV.\u00a0Inseop quickly bowed his head.\u00a0It was a situation where he could guess why Lee Wooyeon wore only one brief and opened the door.\u201cIt\u2019s my manager I talked to earlier.\u00a0Never mind.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon turned his head to answer, the figure of the woman disappeared inside.Inseop blushed like a person being beaten in the cheek in the middle of the market, unable to hide his embarrassment.\u201cAre you really here for medicine?\u201dWhen he thought that Lee Wooyeon had misunderstood him like that, Inseop could not sleep at all.In addition, he was naturally worried because a person who never says that he was sick made a sound of headache while calling. However, looking at the two that were talking now, it was doubtful whether the moaning sound really came from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth.Inseop had to watch closely with his own eyes to see how the drugs he had barely obtained as there were no pharmacies that opened late had become useless.Inseop wanted to die.What misunderstanding did he mean?\u00a0Lee Wooyeon doesn\u2019t even think about him in the first place.\u00a0So there was no misunderstanding.He couldn\u2019t even laugh at his own stupidity anymore.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed to the flowerpot In-seop was holding and asked.\u201cNothing\u2026 no.\u201d\u201cTomorrow\u2019s schedule starts late in the afternoon, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate.\u00a0Inseop, then go in and rest.\u201dChoi Inseop nodded his head.\u00a0As the door closed, Lee Wooyeon and the woman\u2019s voices drifted further away.Inseop, who was holding the flowerpot, had to exhale slowly, feeling the shame rising to the end of his throat.\u00a0Bitter memories with a sour smell of filth flooded his mind with every breath he exhaled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

51Chapter 51Translated by NaralaraEdited by Naralara\u201cHow is it?\u00a0Is it okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t it too naughty?\u201d\u201cHey, you have to wear something like this.\u00a0That way those bitches will flatten their noses, right?\u00a0Bitch Sandra, how surprised would she be to see me and the prince side by side.\u00a0Isn\u2019t it?\u201dJennie, dressed as Catwoman, looked at herself in front of the mirror and gave a satisfied expression.\u201cHowever\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Did you contact Philip?\u00a0Did he come to pick me up?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0There was no such thing.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange?\u00a0He usually comes to my house.\u201dWhen attending a party as a partner with a woman, coming to the front of the house as an escort was one of the basics.\u00a0However, there was no way Jennie could hear such a thing in her over-excited ears.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s usually during this time though.\u00a0How about it?\u00a0You can escort me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Jennie.\u201dPeter wept.\u00a0It was this part that the two were in sharp opposition.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0Even if you weren\u2019t invited, you\u2019re my friend who came with me.\u201cStill, I\u2026\u00a0I just don\u2019t want to go.\u201dPeter shook his head.\u00a0With Jennie\u2019s threats and conciliation, requests and pleas, Peter also prepared a suit, but no matter how much he thought about it, he thought that this should not be the case.\u201cWhy?\u00a0It will be fun.\u00a0It\u2019s a party that only the best kids in our school are invited to.\u00a0If you go, you will never regret it.\u201d\u201c\u2026I probably won\u2019t even fit in.\u201dWhat if Philip recognizes him?\u00a0He said to Jenny that he had no contact with him, so maybe she would be angry.\u201cThen what about me?\u201dJennie, who was fixing her makeup in front of the mirror, looked back and asked.\u201cThen what do I do?\u00a0If other girls lock me in the bathroom, who will save me?\u201d\u201cAm I going to go into the women\u2019s restroom then?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I mean.\u00a0Anyway, you are my one and only friend.\u00a0You have an obligation to watch the scene where I confidently take the seat next to the prince.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dPeter was also concerned.Even though it was the day of the party, there was no phone call for Jennie, so he wondered if the person who sent the letter was really the one who invited Jennie to the party.\u00a0He told Jennie to check this out again, but she didn\u2019t seem to listen.\u201cYou look like that again.\u00a0Are you saying you don\u2019t believe me?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s because I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re that worried, you can escort me.\u201dPeter sighed deeply.\u00a0Jenniee was right.\u00a0If he was worried, it was probably the friend\u2019s job to at least bring her to the doorstep.\u201cYeah, I see.\u201dPeter\u2019s mother asked outside the door if they weren\u2019t ready yet.\u00a0It was within walking distance, but when she heard that they had been invited to a party for the first time, she decided to drive her own car.\u201cI\u2019m done!\u201dJennie, who had said the same thing 20 minutes ago, asked while blinking her eyelashes with mascara.\u201cHow do I look?\u201d\u201cPretty.\u201dPeter smiled and pulled out a tissue to fix the smudged makeup on her.\u00a0When the two of them were ready to go down to the first floor, Peter\u2019s mother liked it and took a picture of them.\u201cIt\u2019s like a pre prom.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAfter getting into the car, Jennie did not stop talking for a moment.\u00a0It was proof that she was very nervous.The party took place in a mansion less than two blocks from Philip\u2019s house.\u00a0Philip\u2019s father, famous enough to be mentioned in newspapers, owned three houses in the surrounding area alone.\u00a0One of them was used as a rental when guests stayed for a long time, and sometimes they hold parties like this.\u201cGo and have fun, both of you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Aunt.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u00a0I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m done.\u201dPeter opened the car door first and walked out.\u00a0After holding Jennie\u2019s hand and helping her get out, she closed the door.\u00a0Peter sighed as he watched his mother\u2019s car move away.Now really, it was his turn to escort Jenny.\u201cJennie.\u00a0If the atmosphere is even a little strange, you can come out.\u00a0Understand?\u201d\u201cBecause you are really scared.\u00a0So, how are you going to get the surgery next week?\u201dShe smiled as she stroked Peter\u2019s hand with her long tail attached to her hip.\u201cThe surgery is done by the doctor, not me.\u201d\u201cThat is even scarier.\u00a0You\u2019re just putting yourself in someone else\u2019s hands.\u00a0What if you can\u2019t wake up forever?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say anything stupid.\u00a0Then you want me to die and regret it?\u201dThe surgery next week was a really important one.\u00a0As Jennie said, there was a possibility that he would never wake up.\u00a0In fact, that was the case with every operation he underwent.\u00a0This time, it was a more difficult and dangerous operation than all the previous surgeries combined.\u00a0He waited almost four years to get surgery from Dr. Johnson, one of the top five heart surgeons in the United States.\u00a0The list of patients for surgery is long, and there are even rumors that the patients waiting for him will fill an American city.\u00a0Peter\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t good enough for surgery yet, but he couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\u00a0If he missed this opportunity, his turn would be pushed back 20 years, so Peter decided to have surgery.\u201cWhy will you die?\u00a0You will live longer than me\u00a0After surgery, you\u2019ll get better and come back to school.\u201d\u201cI hope so.\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s a long time ago, would you like to join the party?\u201d\u201cHmm, \u2026\u00a0okay.\u201dWith that answer, Peter only stared at the bell in front of the door, but didn\u2019t even put a finger on it.\u00a0In the end, Jennie, who could not bear him, pushed him away and rang the bell without hesitation.\u00a0The door opened without asking who it was, whether it was because of the party.The moment he stepped inside, Peter froze on the spot.\u00a0None of the people drinking and having fun were pretending to be someone else.\u00a0It was only natural that Jennie in her catwoman outfit caught everyone\u2019s attention.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Jennie.\u00a0Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u201dJennie, too, noticed something strange, but insisted on seeing Philip.\u201cJennie.\u00a0only you\u2026\u201d\u201cOh my, who is this?\u00a0Isn\u2019t that Jennifer Bate?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dPeter could tell who the women were talking about.\u00a0Sandra was a tall, dark-haired woman with dark makeup, Kelly was a blonde, busty, and bad-tempered Barbie doll, and Rachel was the woman next to her who looked like she was poisoning the food her fellow models ate.\u00a0It was because he heard Jennie talk about them so much it pierced his ears, and that was enough to recognize them at a glance.\u201cI came here by invitation.\u201d\u201cInvite?\u00a0By whom?\u201d\u201cBy Philip.\u201dWhen Jennie proudly raised her head and said, the girls burst into laughter.\u00a0The other people around also laughed at Jennie.He had a foreboding of something bad.\u00a0Peter took Jennie\u2019s hand and whispered quietly to get out.\u201cWhy am I leaving?\u00a0I was invited to a party.\u00a0Where is Philip?\u201d\u201cHey, he\u2019s in the backyard pool.\u201dAs soon as Sandra finished speaking, Jennie started walking across the living room.\u00a0Peter quickly followed and grabbed Jennie\u2019s arm.\u201cJenny, let\u2019s go.\u00a0I think you better go home.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re like this again.\u201d\u201cI think\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to hear your thoughts!\u201dJennie shouted in a sharp voice.\u00a0Peter was angry and wanted to go back, but he couldn\u2019t leave Jenny here alone.\u201cListen to me, Jennie.\u201d\u201cThere he is!\u201dJennie, who found Philip, shook off Peter\u2019s hand and ran away.\u00a0The courtyard connected to the pool had to go down half a floor.\u00a0Seeing Jennie running down the stairs, Peter sighed and followed her.\u201cPhilip!\u00a0Philip!\u201dJennie called his name and ran to the door leading to the backyard.\u00a0Until then, Peter had only thought of taking her back home.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to embarrass her in front of Philip any more.\u201cJennie, let\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cYou go.\u201d\u201cJennie!\u201d\u201cYou go, Peter.\u201dJennie gave her strength to open the door.\u00a0The door that had been closed moved tightly and opened with a rattling sound.\u201cPhil\u2026!\u201dAs Jennie took a step forward calling out his name, something poured down over her head.\u00a0Peter, who was standing next to her, also had it pour over him.Upon confirming that the two were drenched, Sandra and the crew cheered on the terrace and liked it.\u00a0People around them also burst into laughter.Peter froze on the spot.\u00a0The water that fell from above had a sour smell because it was a mixture of all kinds of food and alcohol.\u00a0When he wiped the food residue off his face with his palm, Peter could see Philip properly.Lying on the bed next to Melinda, he slowly got up from his seat with a look of what the hell was going on.\u00a0His face, wearing a white shirt and black jeans, was a mixture of perplexity and bewilderment, and a little bit of annoyance as if he didn\u2019t like the commotion.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dWhen Philip asked that question, Jennie, who was trembling, said, \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d and looked at Philip.\u00a0Philip looked at her with puzzled eyes.\u00a0Peter immediately understood what that brief glance meant.Philip doesn\u2019t know her.\u00a0He had no idea how this situation was going.\u201cI, you invited me\u2026\u201dWearing revealing clothes and wearing ice-cold water, Jennie\u2019s lips trembled.\u00a0The water smeared the mascara and made her face like something out of a grotesque movie.\u00a0Still, the people around her looked at her with interest as she continued to stutter to Philip.\u201cI, I mean\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but only invited people can come here.\u00a0You must have misunderstood something.\u201dPhilip kindly explained to Jennie, but with a look of disbelief, she pulled out a wet piece of paper from her pocket and held it out.\u201cI, this\u2026\u201dPhilip did not accept the paper, glanced down once before answering.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cGet me a towel over there.\u201dSomeone handed the towels piled up by the pool, and Philip gave them to Jennie.\u00a0Philip said in a friendly but firm voice to Jennie, who was about to say thank you.\u201cIf you run out of towels, you can use more.\u00a0The bathroom is over there, do you need anything more?\u201dIf you don\u2019t need anything, will you leave?No one could not understand these last words.\u00a0Jennie asked, grabbing the towel and squeezing out her last courage.\u201cYou do not know?\u00a0I keep writing to you on orange stationery\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I never saw it.\u201dHaving said that, Philip turned around and walked back to where he had been sitting.\u00a0Friends around asked Philip who these two were, and Philip shrugged and answered.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u00a0It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve both seen each other.\u201dPeter\u2019s body turned red as if blood rushed to his face.Philip;s words were more shocking than when he was covered in dirty clothes.\u00a0He ran out of the house.\u00a0Jennie followed and called Peter\u2019s name.\u00a0Peter was so embarrassed that he almost drowned.To Philip, both Jennie nor Peter were just strangers.\u00a0He realized how foolish it was for him to be afraid to be recognized.\u201cPeter!\u00a0Peter!\u201dJennie grabbed his arm.\u201cThere is a misunderstanding.\u00a0Yes there is a misunderstanding\u00a0It\u2019s because Philip doesn\u2019t know what kind of letter I wrote yet.\u00a0If I go and explain the situation, Philip will clear up the misunderstanding and make it clear\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat misunderstanding?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of misunderstanding was there?\u00a0Do you still think he must have read the letter?\u201d\u201cThen what was the reply, that must have been what Philip wrote to me\u2026\u201d\u201cHow do you think Sandra was preparing to pour water on you just in time?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Wait, what do you mean, then Sandra read my letter?\u00a0It can\u2019t be.\u00a0Did you write a letter in Korean?\u00a0Philip obviously replied\u2026\u201d\u201cDoes Philip know your name?\u00a0He doesn\u2019t even know your face.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t know anything!\u201dPeter cried out loudly in anger that a passerby stopped and looked at him.To Philip, Jennie and even Peter were just uninvited guests, nothing more.\u00a0No matter what he did, people like him could not belong to his world.\u00a0In the first place, they were different kinds of human beings.The moment cold water poured down his head, Peter sadly realized the truth.\u00a0The only thing that came after the realization was shame, and anger at himself.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0He\u2019s not interested.\u00a0He was not interested in the first place.\u201dPeter said those words, not knowing if he was saying that to Jennie or himself..\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dJennie\u2019s face turned red and she screamed.\u201cWhat do you know?\u00a0It was you who wrote the letter.\u00a0Guess you don\u2019t even know where Philip\u2019s locker is?\u00a0Isn;t it because you translated it strangely?\u201d\u201cStop it,\u201d Peter shouted and started walking down the street.\u00a0Then Jennie persistently followed after him and chastised him.\u201cWhat did you write in that letter?\u00a0What did you write?\u201d\u201cI wrote what you wrote.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say something strange?\u00a0So Philip got angry\u2026 so that\u2019s why.\u00a0right?\u201d\u201cPlease stop!\u201dPeter said, shaking Jennie\u2019s hand.\u201cWake up\u00a0Jennifer Bate.\u00a0Please calm down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cPhilip doesn\u2019t know you.\u00a0It has always been, and will always be.\u201d\u201cWhy are you saying that?\u201d\u201cHow long will you live in a delusion?\u00a0Please face reality.\u201dIt was for Jennie, and Peter poured out all the words he didn\u2019t even mean to say.\u00a0He hated all this now and was ashamed.\u00a0He was so angry that he just wanted to disappear from this place.Peter took Jennie\u2019s arm and said firmly.\u201cSee?\u00a0This crappy and stupid looking thing is our reality.\u00a0They and we cannot be the same.\u201dPeter continued, looking at the mansion that was lit up brilliantly and the sound of music and laughter blended together.\u201cWake up.\u00a0Wake up from your dreams.\u201d\u201cDream?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Dream.\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be like them?\u00a0What do they say?\u00a0If I were to go to Aunt Spencer\u2019s house, it would be a house like that\u2026\u201d\u201cAunt Spencer?\u201dWhen Peter asked with a snort, Jennie\u2019s expression wrinkled wildly.\u201cWhat about Aunt Spencer?\u201d\u201cDoes Aunt Spencer even exist?\u201dJennie slapped Peter\u2019s cheek.\u00a0Blood dripped from his nose and wet Peter\u2019s lips.\u00a0The bitter taste of blood reached the tip of his tongue.\u201cDo you think everything I told you was a lie?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPeter didn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0It was not that they were all lies, but there was always some exaggeration and lies in her words.\u00a0Peter did not stand by Jennie\u2019s side, even though he knew that it was the only liberation she had endured through that difficult life.\u201cThen why the hell did you come to this party?\u00a0If you didn\u2019t believe me in the first place, why would you come to this party?\u00a0\u2026 Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201dShe smiled as she brushed her wet hair up.\u00a0Tears streamed down her smudged face.\u201cDid you follow me to see Philip?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou also like Philip, don\u2019t you?\u00a0So you were secretly writing something else in my letter?\u00a0Is that so?\u201dJennie\u2019s mental world was weakened,, and it was so disorganized that it collapsed with the touch of a hand.\u00a0The only thing that could come out of her was accusations and anger towards the other person.\u201cYou were pretending to be helping me and fussing behind me.\u00a0Right?\u00a0You hooked up with that piggy Fred too.\u00a0Even Fred says he goes into heat when he sees you.\u00a0I saw the soccer punks walking with you and me, and I heard a giggle saying that if they had to go with either of us, they would hit you.\u00a0Hahaha.\u00a0Did you deliberately go out and flirt with the Korean group you attend?\u00a0But Philip doesn\u2019t pay any attention to you, so you\u2019re taking revenge on me like this.\u00a0Isn\u2019t it?\u201dPeter was at a loss for words.\u00a0His fingertips trembled at the thought that the person swearing at him, as if possessed by evil, was really the friend he loved.\u201cShall I go and tell Philip?\u00a0Tell him you like Philip, and you wrote the whole letter!\u00a0In fact, it\u2019s all up to you!\u201dSeeing Jennie raising her hands wide and screaming, Peter answered quietly.\u201cJennie, stop it.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Are you embarrassed?\u00a0I\u2019m going to tell him.\u201dPeter knew that Jennie didn\u2019t even know what she was talking about.\u00a0Still, he couldn\u2019t hold her and pat her.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to then.\u00a0There was no room for that.It was the same hurt and the same hardship, Peter believed.Peter was also just 18 years young.\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore.\u201dPeter walked out, leaving Jennie behind.\u00a0That was the last conversation he had with Jennie.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

52Chapter 52Translated by NaralaraEdited by NaralaraAfter getting off the bus, passing through the alleyway and climbing the slope for a while, Inseop could see his house.\u00a0When he first bought a house here, he had trouble sleeping because he was worried about going up and down the slope.\u00a0Obviously, on a hot summer day, on his way home, he fell and was found like a fallen corpse, which he thought seriously would make people uncomfortable.Currently, Inseop was realizing how the human body quickly adapts to the environment.\u00a0Even though he was almost all the way up the slope, he couldn\u2019t breathe.\u00a0Maybe it was because of Kate, the Mimosa in his arms, that he was walking slowly, taking care not to stress it out.\u00a0Instead of being out of breath, his steps were heavy.Climbing up to the top of a mountain where no one lives, he felt like he wanted to run up, shouting \u201cI am the world\u2019s greatest idiot\u201d ten thousand times.As he was slowly going up the slope, someone\u2019s profile caught his eye.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was an unwelcome face.\u00a0Recognizing Inseop was coming, she raised her hand to greet him.\u201cWhere did you go with the flowerpot?\u00a0Don\u2019t tell me you came out in the middle of the night to repot that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI called you on your cell phone, but you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d\u201cIt turned it off due to low battery.\u201dInseop turned off his cell phone as soon as he got into the elevator of his apartment, in case Lee Wooyeon would contact him.\u201cI kept waiting.\u201dWhen he thought about why reporter Kim Haeshin had come all the way here, Inseop\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cWhy do you need to make such a distasteful expression?\u00a0I want us to help each other out.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want any help from reporter Kim.\u201d\u201cReally?\u00a0You really don\u2019t?\u00a0I think you should think about it well.\u00a0So, shall I go now and tell Lee Wooyeon or CEO Kim what I found out?\u201d\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dInseop passed by her side.\u00a0To such a person, he should not show any weakness.\u00a0Because the moment she sees a gap, she\u2019ll attack.\u201cOkay.\u00a0However, Choi Inseop here has a very different face from the Choi Inseop I know.\u00a0What has happened?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cI have one of my friends who is a master in this field.\u00a0Suddenly booking a flight to America with a burner phone, isn\u2019t it strange?\u00a0My reporter\u2019s senses fluttered wildly.\u00a0I\u2019m busy these days and it\u2019s been really hard to figure this out.\u00a0So what\u2019s Lee Wooyeon\u2019s phone number\u2026\u201dReporter Kim Haeshin took out her cell phone while muttering to herself.He must not look back.\u00a0If he looks back, everything will go according to that woman\u2019s will.\u201cHello.\u00a0This is reporter Kim Haeshin.\u201dHis brain went blank.\u00a0He didn\u2019t care, but the person who he borrowed his name from may be harmed.\u00a0Inseop reached out and grabbed the phone from her hand.\u00a0When he checked the phone, the call was not even connected.\u2026He was deceived.\u201cI don\u2019t mean to ask you for that difficult thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cBefore your resignation, you just need to have a brief interview with me.\u00a0I just have a few questions for you.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019ll just do an interview?\u201dReporter Kim Haeshin pulled out a tape recorder from her pocket and held it in front of Choi In-eop.\u00a0When Inseop looked down at it with a puzzled expression, she shrugged.\u201cI don\u2019t mean to do this, but it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have the confidence to remember this conversation.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry.\u00a0Please tell me a little about what happened that day.\u00a0From what I\u2019ve heard, I know that Kang Youngmo had a bit of an argument with Inseop that day.\u00a0Is that right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cChoi Inseop didn\u2019t take Lee Wooyeon home that day, right?\u00a0Did you have an altercation with Kang Youngmo that day and went home?\u00a0Does Lee Wooyeon know about that too?\u201d\u201cI was tired that day and went home.\u00a0That\u2019s all.\u201dWhen Inseop did not give the answer she wanted, reporter Kim Haeshin clicked her tongue with a troubled face.\u00a0She turned off the tape recorder and put it back in her pocket.\u201cWe can\u2019t do it today.\u00a0I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u00a0And please bring at least one good article that day.\u201dThis was the stage of intimidation.It starts with something simple at first, and eventually adds another condition one by one.\u00a0Choi Inseop realized that she wouldn\u2019t let him go until she got what she wanted.\u201cI\u2019m not a journalist, so I don\u2019t know what an article should be.\u201d\u201cThink about it.\u00a0I\u2019ll give you some time to write.\u00a0And where is Choi Inseop originally from?\u00a0Oh, is this also a secret?\u00a0Then I will call you later.\u201dShe tapped Inseop on the shoulder and walked down the slope.A very easy road has been opened.\u00a0To get Lee Wooyeon off the spot, all he had to do was hand over the picture to reporter Kim Haeshin.\u00a0She will get rid of Lee Wooyeon by any means.\u00a0It was also important to find the right person to send photos to.\u00a0If the celebrity or the person had a close cooperative relationship with the agency, there was a possibility that they would contact the agency before making it public and destroy the evidence.\u00a0If they were a money lover, they can ask for money from Lee Wooyeon and then hand over the data.\u00a0So, Choi Inseop had a list of reporters and newspapers who were favorable to Lee Wooyeon and his agency and had them on a table.\u00a0Each reporter was found, read, and separated.Reporter Kim Haeshin was a very special type.\u00a0She risked her life for a scoop, and once she bit a celebrity, she was a poisonous dog that would never let go.The most suitable person to hand over the picture that was taken that day came to Inseop on her own two feet.\u00a0If it were her, she was a person who could even say that she took the picture because of her desire to enhance her reputation as a reporter in the entertainment department.It was the moment when all the requirements were met and now the only thing left to do was make a decision.Choi Inseop stood there and watched the ominous fortune vanish down the slope.Before leaving the house, Choi Inseop stood in front of the mirror and checked himself.\u00a0It was a decision he made after thinking all night long, so he decided not to think about it again.\u201cGreat.\u201dAfter straightening the disheveled shirt collar, Inseop left the front door.\u00a0As he walked to the office, he looked around carefully, thinking that this time would be the last.Because Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t have a morning schedule today, it was possible to relax.He went to the office and Inseop was going to say that he will quit his job today.\u00a0If asked why, he would give a plausible answer.\u2018My parents told me to study civil service, and I decided that it would be more suitable for my aptitude.\u2019\u00a0What if they stopped him one more time?\u00a0\u2019My father\u2019s health is not getting better these days, so I think I will have to go back to my hometown right away.\u2019\u00a0Can they stop him again?Then he should use his injured finger as an excuse.Inseop looked at the bandaged finger and wished he didn\u2019t have to go this far.\u00a0Kim and Cha, both of them treated him very well, so he knew that each time they stopped him, his heart would weaken.\u00a0That is the reason why he immediately bought a plane ticket for next week.\u00a0If the two of them asked him to work a little longer and to think about it, he wouldn\u2019t be able to cut them off.Fortunately, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager is changed once every three months, so no one would think it would be strange if he quit at this point.He arrived in front of the office as he was organizing his thoughts.\u00a0Saying hello to the old security guard in the building with a familiar face now, Inseop got on the elevator.\u00a0The moment he was about to press the floor number of the office, a large hand dug into the gap in the elevator door that was about to close.\u00a0The elevator door opened and Lee Wooyeon stepped in.\u201c\u2026\u201dChoi Inseop knew that his expression was clearly of shock, but he couldn\u2019t show any other reaction at that moment.\u201cGood morning.\u201dHe was wearing sunglasses, so he couldn\u2019t tell if his eyes were smiling, but his voice was sweeter than yesterday.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Hello.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule for today was to go to the gym after sleeping till late in the morning, and in the afternoon to talk with the director about filming the drama.\u00a0He was not supposed to be in the office early in the morning.\u00a0Besides, yesterday he was obviously with the actress\u2026\u201cYou came early.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t look well. I guess you didn\u2019t sleep at all last night\u201dInseop, who had been contemplating all night, got up only when he saw the window brightening.\u201cDid you have a good time?\u201dThe elevator arrived at the office as soon as Inseop was about to answer, noticing the truth behind the words thrown like a joke.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon blinked at Inseop to get off first.\u00a0An office worker who left early saw the two of them coming in side by side and greeted them.\u201cHello.\u00a0What are you up to today?\u00a0Both of you came together.\u201d\u201cDid the CEO come?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.\u201cYou will have to wait 30 minutes.\u00a0Please wait inside.\u201dLee Wooyeon turned his gaze to Inseop.\u201cWhat are you doing here, Mr. Inseop?\u201d\u201cI came to see the CEO.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then, let\u2019s go together.\u201dAs he walked to the office, Inseop thought that his life must have a revolving door through which misfortune and good fortune came and went.Sitting on the sofa in the CEO\u2019s room, Lee Wooyeon placed the briefcase he was holding on the table.\u00a0Choi Inseop asked if he would like a drink.\u201cNo.\u00a0I already had breakfast.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Okay.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even have to ask who made it.\u00a0Yesterday, at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house, the actress, who was half-naked, was rumored to be good at cooking, so she filmed several related commercials and was also running a related business.Choi Inseop stood far away from the sofa, looking at the calendar and pictures on the wall, waiting for CEO Kim to return.\u00a0But Lee Wooyeon got up and stood behind Inseop.\u201cThis is my picture.\u00a0Do you know when it was filmed?\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed his finger at the photo he took during the photo shoot.\u00a0Inseop nodded his head.\u201cI know.\u00a0When you went to Saipan from P company 3 years ago and did a solo photo shoot\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u00a0So, do you know when this is?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked, pointing to a black-and-white photo of him wearing a hat and smoking on the street.\u201cI understand that it was a photo that a famous photographer accidentally took and posted on his blog when he attended a film awards ceremony in Paris a year ago.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0Exactly.\u201dA soft smile was drawn on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips.\u00a0Inseop was concerned about the man\u2019s breath touching his back, so he couldn\u2019t move and just looked at the picture.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows me as well as Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0thank you.\u201dInseop\u2019s white nape was quickly dyed red with shame.\u00a0He just prayed that Lee Wooyeon standing behind would not notice it.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s arm touched Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0Standing as if leaning on his shoulder, Lee Wooyeon continued speaking with a plain face.\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Mr. Inseop, so that\u2019s really unfortunate.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u00a0In fact, Inseop doesn;t know what\u2019s important either. Are we the same?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0yes, what\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s breath touched the tip of his hair.\u00a0Inseop just wanted to get out of this awkward posture quickly.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cInseop, you said you wanted to know my weaknesses in the past.\u201dInseop looked back with an expression like a herbivore whose nape was bitten by a predator.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop and asked seriously.\u201cIf I tell you that, will you sign a contract?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAt the sudden and absurd suggestion, Inseop did not know what to say, so he remained silent.\u201cIf that\u2019s what Inseop wants, I\u2019ll let you know, so would you like to continue working with me?\u201dIt felt like he was on a Mobius strip.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t a sweet joke or a pun.\u00a0Inseop wanted to know why Lee Wooyeon wanted to have him by his side so much.\u00a0But a warning sounded like an instinct in his head that he shouldn\u2019t ask about it.\u201cIt will be a new start, one by one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat was he saying now?\u00a0Was this another new language expression?No, he doesn\u2019t have to worry about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words.\u00a0He was not going to sign the contract anyway.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dInseop calmly opened his mouth.\u00a0In fact, after he tells CEO Kim and Manager Cha that he will quit his job today, he was going to inform Lee Wooyeon by phone or text message.\u00a0He didn\u2019t have the courage to speak to him face to face.But since they met in the office like this, he felt like he had to tell him in person.\u201cWhat?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was sitting, raised his body forward and asked.\u00a0The moment Inseop was about to answer, the door to the CEO\u2019s room opened and CEO Kim came inside screaming.\u201cArg!\u00a0Really!\u00a0I won\u2019t leave her alone.\u00a0Isn\u2019t Kim Haeshin really crazy?\u00a0I\u2019m really angry now.\u00a0What, Lee Wooyeon, why are you here?\u00a0Did you come after seeing the article on the internet too?\u201d\u201cAn Internet article?\u201d\u201cKim Haeshin posted a CCTV footage on her Twitter account after the accident, saying that she would reveal where you were after you left the restaurant.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked with a stern tone.\u201cWas there even a scene where I hit Kang Youngmo?\u201d\u201c\u2026Of course it wasn\u2019t there, but the fact that she posted an article saying it was strange to go around that area.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m suing.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled broadly in response.\u00a0CEO Kim asked, \u201cIs that easy?\u201d and sat across from him.\u00a0It was not a matter of suing the reporter.\u00a0Since it usually ends up with them being slapped with a fine, the only thing to worry about was the issue after the lawsuit.\u00a0It was clear that a reporter with a poor personality like Kim Haeshin would try to write bad news more persistently after being sued, thereby undermining the celebrity\u2019s image.\u201cBut what are you two doing here this morning?\u201d\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cBoth?\u00a0What?\u00a0It\u2019s not like you two are dating, are you?\u00a0Then I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dLee Wooyeon was the only one who laughed out loud at the joke CEO Kim threw.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0Please, am I crazy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon\u2019s laughter grew louder, Inseop\u2019s expression darkened.\u201cIf I say that, I will call the CEO my father.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u00a0I never had a son like you, and I don\u2019t want to.\u00a0No, wait a minute, how many years apart are we for you to call me father?\u201dSeeing CEO Kim getting angry, Lee Wooyeon swept up his messy hair and laughed softly.\u201cSince it\u2019s ladies first, then, Mr. Inseop, you tell first.\u201dLee Wooyeon turned his head to Inseop.\u00a0There was still a playful smile in his eyes.Inseop swallowed hard.\u00a0It was finally time to put an end to it.\u00a0Clenching his hands tightly so as not to tremble, Choi Inseop opened his mouth.\u201cI will quit my job as of today.\u201dThe moment Inseop finished speaking, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smile fell from his face.When he returned home and organized his clothes, Inseop smiled sadly.How was it that simple?When he announced his intention to resign at the office, as expected, at first, CEO Kim jumped up and down, confirmed that Inseop\u2019s will was stubborn, and eventually accepted the resignation with a face that said that there was nothing he could do.Lee Wooyeon looked at Inseop for a moment without saying a word, then frowned slightly and fell into thought.\u00a0He was holding his chin with his hand and bowing his head, but he couldn\u2019t tell what kind of expression he had.Then, Lee Wooyeon reached out to Inseop.\u2018You\u2019ve worked hard all this time.\u00a0Thank you.\u2019Inseop hesitated, then grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand.\u00a0The moment the large, generous hand wrapped around his own, he felt like crying.\u00a0It was the hand he held when he first started working.\u00a0As the warmth that had embraced his hand faded away, Inseop became aware of it.\u00a0This was really the last time.\u00a0The day he will hold this hand will never come again.After receiving the call, manager Cha, who ran to him, patted Inseop on the shoulder with a strange face, but didn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0Inseop said he would work until this week, but Lee Wooyeon firmly shook his head.Inseop felt a clear line in his words, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t cause any more trouble to people who go out.\u201d\u00a0Realizing that there was no reason for him to be there anymore, Inseop greeted the people and left the office.Manager Cha said that he would send him off, but Inseop refused.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon only waved his hand with a friendly smile in the CEO\u2019s room.\u201cIt\u2019s over\u2026\u201dSo many things happened.He remembered the times he worked hard to get here.\u00a0It was the road that he had come to push himself into as atonement for Jennie.\u00a0He had the result in his hands, but couldn\u2019t decide what to do with it, so Inseop finally decided to embrace it and go to America.Not making a decision right now doesn\u2019t change anything.\u00a0When he made up his mind like that at dawn yesterday, his thoughts that had been tangled like tangled skeins were organized.But he will not hand over anything to reporter Kim Haeshin.\u00a0It was enough to hand over a couple of pages that were the most appropriate among Lee Wooyeon\u2019s complex female relations data he has collected.That would be it.While organizing the clothes to throw away and the clothes to take, Inseop looked around his rooftop room again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Love History Caused by Willful NegligenceCH 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201c\u2026\u00a0Mr. Lee Wooyeon!\u201d\u201cAh yes.\u201d\u201cWooyeon, are you listening?\u00a0Have you even thought about which method is the best?\u201d\u201cWell.\u00a0I\u2019m still thinking about it some more.\u00a0I will discuss it with the CEO.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0So let\u2019s finish it up for today.\u00a0Because it seems that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s heart is somewhere else.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and got up from his seat.Seeing tManager Cha rising from afar, the PD tilted his head, saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cBut where did the manager go?\u00a0He has big eyes and looks stupid, but he is a good manager.\u201d\u201cHe quit.\u201d\u201cReally?\u00a0It\u2019s a shame.\u00a0He was a friend who was good at work and seemed sincere.\u00a0Give me his contact information.\u00a0I have an idea, I have to ask him to come and work at our company.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Why?\u00a0Are you sad that he suddenly quit so you don\u2019t want him to work somewhere else?\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0No way.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled cheerfully and greeted director Kim.\u00a0When Inseop said he was quitting and left, manager Cha accepted the job as his manager with a face like an old man carrying death on his back.It was a company that wouldn\u2019t change much if one person left.\u00a0For the time being, even if it was not Manager Cha, he\u2019ll just have to take someone temporarily and let them drive him.When Choi Inseop said that he was quitting his job abruptly, CEO Kim or Manager Cha looked a little surprised at first, but said that they saw it coming.\u00a0They had no doubt that Inseop quit his job because Lee Wooyeon had done something behind the scenes.It was Lee Wooyeon who was the most shocked on the spot.It was as if the sparrow he was holding in his hand suddenly bit off the back of his hand and flew off to a branch.\u201cAfter treating that person with kindness\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon knew early on that Choi Inseop was not the same person as Choi Inseop on the paper.\u00a0Either way, he didn\u2019t say anything to CEO Kim because he thought it had nothing to do with changing him anyway.It was the day that Inseop called him Phillip that changed his mind.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon mobilized his connections to investigate who Choi Inseop was, who was the manager now.\u00a0Not long after, he got a very annoying phone call.\u00a0They said that no one could be found in Korea that matches the photo he sent. Lee Wooyeon hung up the phone asking for acceptable results.And yesterday, while having sex for a long time, he got the result quickly.\u00a0Thinking that there was nothing in the world that can\u2019t be done with money, he looked at Inseop\u2019s personal information in the envelope.\u00a0If he had put his mind to it, he would have been able to find out about this easily, but it was clear that CEO Kim was a fucking idiot when it came to hiring people.\u00a0Even if a person like Kim Haeshin came in to become a manager, he would readily accept her.First, he went to the office to talk with CEO Kim, and he saw the back of a head going into the elevator, which he had seen a lot.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon stopped the elevator and went up to the office with Inseop.There, Lee Wooyeon made the last suggestion.\u00a0Inseop looked very surprised.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon thought that Inseop would naturally accept his proposal.However, the answer that came out of Choi Inseop\u2019s mouth was like smashing Lee Wooyeon on the back of the head and splitting it in half.Choi Inseop, who acted as if he would never quit his job as a manager even if the earth was halfway, uttered the words of quitting too casually.\u00a0The way he said it was so natural that at first, Lee Wooyeon even wondered if he had heard it wrong.\u00a0CEO Kim tried to stop him suddenly, but Inseop expressed his intention to quit so firmly that it was as if he was hiding such a knife-like personality.He even got rid of Kang Youngmo, who was bothering him, and put up with the fact that he got drunk and flirted with him, but suddenly he backstabbed him like this.As he thought about it as he walked to the parking lot, Lee Wooyeon felt his anger rising.\u00a0In practical terms, there was no loss to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He was a one-time use manager, so it was enough to get someone else.But he felt like he was losing money.He smiled and asked to shake hands, but inwardly, he thought about breaking one of his wrists.\u201cI thought I would break it\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon mumbled and got into the car, and Manager Cha turned around asking if he said something.\u00a0The moment he saw the bearded face, Lee Wooyeon became irritated for some reason.\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to you\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0okay.\u00a0Did you finish talking to him well?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s fucking over.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u00a0Where should I go now?\u201d\u201cThe manager has to take care of that, so how should I know?\u201dManager Cha sighed deeply, took his cell phone out of his pocket and called the office.\u00a0After talking to the staff in charge of the schedule, he looked at Lee Wooyeon.\u201cIs there no schedule after this?\u201d\u201cWho said that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dManager Cha, remembering the face of CEO Kim who was crying and clinging to him telling what it means to be a good friend, gritted his teeth gently.\u201cThen go home.\u201dHe started the car and slowly made his way out of the parking lot.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon sat with his arms crossed and looked out the window.Disliking the harsh silence, Manager Cha turned on the radio and opened the window.\u00a0As the wind, which had now become quite cool, breezed into the van, the unpleasant feeling seemed to be relieved a little, so the manager hummed.\u00a0But the hum didn\u2019t last even a single verse.\u201cIt\u2019s fucking loud.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cTurn off the radio too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMotherfucker. He was really unlucky.Manager Cha swallowed the fireball inside and turned off the radio.\u00a0Again, the inside of the car was filled with a harsh silence that seemed to have swallowed them.Manger Cha came up with regrets about his life as to why he was doing this at this age.\u00a0The moment he saw the post-it that Choi Inseop had written on his to-do list next to the driver\u2019s seat, manager Cha was moved by the gentleness of Inseop.He opened his mouth and spoke to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI mean, I wasn\u2019t going to say this\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to say it, don\u2019t say it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.No, I still have to say it.\u00a0You need to change your character.\u00a0I wonder if Choi Inseop quit and left because of that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dSeeing Lee Wooyeon shutting his mouth, Manager Cha asked whether that was true.\u201cI pretended to be nice to Inseop, and asked him to sign a three-year contract, and you\u2019re saying I bullied him behind the scenes, but look.\u00a0In the end, even that good Inseop quits and leaves.\u00a0The CEO will call me later and tell me again, but in the end, no matter who you bring\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cAh!\u00a0Whoa!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon slammed the car glass with his elbow, the glass in the back seat cracked with a popping sound.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smashed the car glass several more times with his fists one after another, as if that would relieve his anger.\u00a0Manager Cha wondered how the car that was running next to them was reacting, so he opened the car door and checked the van.\u00a0Manager Cha began to contemplate on whether or not to jump out of the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cHey, Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0People are outside\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWhat about them?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cThe nice Choi Inseop didn\u2019t like it, so he left, but what do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cYeah, so it wasn\u2019t that you were trying to get him out\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cWhat a masterpiece.\u00a0Fuck, that bastard did that and I tried to close my eyes.\u201d\u201cWhat, what did you close your eyes for?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0Cause it\u2019s all over\u00a0Drive straight ahead.\u201dLee Wooyeon sat down with his arm crossed again.His profile was as beautiful and elegant as a picture, but he never knew when he would turn into a vicious monster.A gentle spring breeze blew in through the cracked glass.\u00a0However, Cha took off his shirt and drove the car, feeling like a dog pulling a sled in the middle of the North Pole.It was with one phone call from CEO Kim that the thin ice plate was broken.[Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0If you see this text, please contact me.][Lee Wooyeon, please call me when you see this text message.][Hey, you fucking bastard!\u00a0Are you planning to fuck me over?][Please, Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Please, please, please.][Right now, as you said, I applied for an embargo to put the news on hold, but don\u2019t you think I should explain the situation!!!][Lee Wooyeon, fuck you\u2026\u00a0If I don\u2019t kill you today, I\u2019m going to change my last name!!][Lee Wooyeon, please.\u00a0Please give me a call.][Wooyeon! Wooyeon, Wooyeon!!!!!!!]Since then, dozens of text messages from CEO Kim have continued.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon roughly checked the text, turned off the phone, and put it back in his pocket.\u00a0A man\u2019s screams was heard behind him.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201dLee Wooyeon spoke kindly and threw the tissue he got at the gas station into the back seat.\u201cIf you get blood stains on it, it won\u2019t come off well, so please clean it yourself.\u201dAs soon as Wooyeon said that, the man began to frantically wipe the blood-stained leather seat with a tissue.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon laughed softly.\u00a0Holding a cigarette in one hand and turning the steering wheel, he stepped on the accelerator.\u00a0The Ferrari borrowed from CEO Kim made a heavy sound and moved forward.A car passed slowly sideways.\u00a0Horns were honking at the Ferrari, which was zigzagging in all directions, as if it was doing acrobatics.\u00a0The man behind him groaned and clasped his head with his palms.\u201cYou won\u2019t die.\u00a0People don\u2019t die that easily.\u201dLee Wooyeon spoke in a light tone, opened the window and flicked off the cigarette ashes.\u00a0A great roar echoed in his ears due to the speed of the car.\u00a0As the glass of the car slowly moved upward, he heard the cry of the man sitting behind him again.\u201cShut up before I rip your mouth open. I don\u2019t want to hear you bastard squeal.\u201dLee Wooyeon said firmly.\u00a0The man nodded his head and said in a trembling voice, begging for help.\u201cWho said I was going to kill you?\u00a0We\u2019ve already finished talking.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u00a0that\u2026.\u201dLee Wooyeon suddenly turned the steering wheel.\u00a0Smoke was rising from the wheels of the Ferrari due to the sudden stop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who stopped the car, turned back from the driver\u2019s seat.When the man sitting behind him met his eyes, he trembled and put his hands together asking him to save his life.\u201cI said you would save you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Save me, please\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0But you have to do what I said.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 then I\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon said it wasn\u2019t a big deal and shook his head as if annoyed.\u00a0Holding the steering wheel in one hand, he thought for a moment, and then he said in a very relaxed tone.\u201cI\u2019m going to bring your older brother who I hung up on the mountain before, and I\u2019m going to hang you upside down again.\u00a0You won the rock, paper, scissors and so I brought you back, but I think your brother will do better.\u00a0By the way, when I hang you on the top of the mountain this time, I will only remember roughly where it is.\u201dLee Wooyeon tapped his temple with his finger and said.\u00a0In the dark car, whenever his white teeth could be seen, the man trembled like a leaf.\u201cI\u2019ll just remember it roughly, so even after your brother does his job properly, it will take some time for me to find you.\u00a0Do you understand what I mean?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0let me live\u00a0please.\u00a0Help me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying, soI\u2019ll have to hang you somewhere around here.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon grabbed the steering wheel to turn the car, the man shouted.\u201cNo.\u00a0No.\u00a0I\u2019ll do everything you tell me.\u00a0I\u2019ll do it all, please, just that, please\u2026\u201dThe man, who had just been rescued from hell an hour ago, bowed his head, saying that he would do anything Lee Wooyeon told him to do.\u201cThen say it again.\u00a0Who hit Kang Youngmo?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me and my brother.\u201d\u201cWhy did you hit him?\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to see celebrities\u2026\u00a0 I just did it because I didn\u2019t like seeing people making money and messing around on TV\u2026\u00a0I did it.\u00a0I\u2019ve done it to Lee Wooyeon in the past, but it feels good to tell people that I made him that way, so I want to hit a more famous person\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWhy are you confessing?\u201d\u201cMy, my brother said he was innocent\u2026The two of us were fighting, and my older brother was going to report me, so the person who fights and confesses first gets a lighter sentence\u2026\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon taught, the man continued his confession by stuttering.\u201cOkay. You don\u2019t have an alibi, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re upset? Because you didn\u2019t do it, but you have to confess?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dThe man covered his face with both hands and said yes in a crawling voice.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon burst into laughter like a crazy person.\u201cHahahaha, what are you talking about?\u00a0Hahahahaha.\u201dWhenever Lee Wooyeon\u2019s laughter grew louder, the man shrugged his shoulders and pulled back.\u00a0But in the narrow car, there was nowhere to back off.He thought it was a dream and pinched his thigh several times, but to no avail.\u00a0There was no nightmare like this.He drank makgeolli in the morning with the daily allowance he had received a few days ago, and Lim hyung was sleeping, heavily drunk.\u00a0The nightmare started when a man came to their single room without knocking.\u00a0It took him a while to realize that someone had entered the room as he was drunk.\u00a0By the time he felt something strange, he had already lost consciousness after a strong punch in his face.When he regained consciousness, Lim Hyung realized that they had been dragged into the forest.\u00a0Also the fact that the man who dragged them was the same guy who they had hit and pushed into the lake before.The neat-looking man was holding a shovel in one hand.\u00a0Wearing a high-quality suit, his expression was extremely gentle, and even though his hands and feet were tied, he did not feel a sense of crisis.\u00a0Like an actor \u2013 later he heard that he was actually an actor \u2013 in a gentle voice he said he would make him regret being born. Lim hyung, who has been through all kinds of hardships in his life, laughed at the words of a man who had never experienced hardship.But that smirk didn\u2019t last a minute, and it turned into a terrifying astonishment.If there was a demon in human disguise, it would have a face like that.The man smiled and beat up two people to death with a shovel.\u00a0The man did not bat an eyelid even when he saw that his legs were broken and his knee was torn out.\u00a0That\u2019s what he thought when the grinning man cut off the second knuckle of his brother with the tip of a shovel.There was no use in crying out, \u2018Why the hell are you doing this, and why are you doing this now?\u2019\u00a0He used a shovel to cut off the tattered fingertips of his older brother, which had not been properly cut.The two screamed in fright.\u00a0But there was no one to hear the sound from the hills and save them.The man told them to choose.\u00a0Will you be buried in the mountains or will you be hung on a tree?\u00a0Getting buried sounder better, but after seeing the side profile of the man that muttered, the face no longer looked kind.When he began to bow his head and beg for his life to be spared, the man said with a smile that he would now understand.When he saw hope that he could live, Lim hyung frantically clung to the man.\u2018Just let live.\u00a0I will do anything, I will do anything if you spare my life.\u2019The man told him to pay for his crime.\u2018Wha, what\u2019s the crime?\u2019\u2018The penalty for killing me.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s\u2026\u00a0 but not, not dead but alive!\u2019He said so, holding his bloody finger.\u00a0But the man didn\u2019t seem to like the answer.\u00a0Seeing that he smashed his brother in the face with a shovel.The older brother, who had a broken nose bone, fell to the floor with a strange sound.\u00a0The man spoke in a firm but soft tone.\u2018At that point, I was dead.\u00a0So you have to pay for your sins.\u00a0There are other people who saved me, so that\u2019s not your problem.\u2019The man was asked to choose whether to pay for his crimes legally or privately here.\u00a0Lim hyung, who knew the hidden meaning of the word \u201cpaying for his sins privately,\u201d had no choice but to reply that he would pay it legally.As a result, Lee Wooyeon was driving on the highway with the older brother hanging from a tree and the younger brother in the car.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0You are really fun people.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who had been smiling for a while, stopped laughing.\u00a0The difference in that bizarre change made the man feel his heart froze with fear.\u201cYou are both murderers.\u00a0Because I died once.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cObviously, you made a choice and I brought you here.\u00a0If you are sad, tell me.\u00a0I\u2019ll take you back to the mountain right now.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u00a0No.\u00a0I will pay for my sins.\u201dThe man put his blood-stained hands together and bowed his head.\u201cI like that.\u00a0Then we will be on our way.\u201dLee Wooyeon straightened his body.\u00a0To the man trembling behind him, he said another thing.\u201cIf you have other thoughts or want to run away, you better quit.\u201d\u201cI, I am not thinking of that!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0You made the right decision.\u00a0What will you do when you run away?\u00a0You\u2019ll be caught again wherever you go anyway.\u00a0It\u2019s better to come out cleanly and start a new life than to live your whole life trembling about when I\u2019ll come to catch you, and then get caught again and be buried.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and continued.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about saying anything at the police station.\u00a0Even if it\u2019s not me, there are many people that can catch you and destroy you.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLee Wooyeon stepped on the accelerator.\u00a0The red Ferrari started running again, making a heavy engine noise.\u201cIf Lee Wooyeon comes, I will kill him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0kill him.\u00a0Be sure to kill\u00a0him. Kill him twice, no, kill him three times.\u201d\u201cReally, if I don\u2019t kill him, I\u2019ll have my hands full\u2026\u00a0so just come.\u00a0I really won\u2019t let you go!\u201dCEO Kim screamed and collapsed on the sofa.\u00a0This morning he got a call from the director of the entertainment department of M Company.\u00a0Kim Haeshin was preparing an article, but the content was not serious.\u00a0Reporter Kim Haeshin, who visited Kang Youngmo, who had just been able to speak, showed him a picture of Lee Wooyeon from a nearby CCTV and asked him to check if there was anything strange. \u2018You may not remember the culprit, but if you think about it, he was dressed like this, wasn\u2019t he?\u00a0You won\u2019t be able to see who this person is from a distance, but didn\u2019t you feel like this is the culprit?\u2019\u00a0She persistently planted a connection between Lee Wooyeon and the criminal in Kang Youngmo\u2019s mind, and eventually drew an answer from Kang Youngmo saying that a man with a physique similar to Lee Wooyeon attacked him.\u00a0She said that it was strange that the person who reported to the police used a payphone and made a call, and said that she had an interview with a man who was believed to have made the call.\u00a0Obviously, the reporter had a close relationship with the criminal, so he accidentally saw the scene and reported it, but the article ended with the statement that he could not proceed.\u00a0And the director said that there was a CCTV picture that looked like Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0The problem is that there is a file of an interview of Kim Haeshin with a man who has a voice that is very similar to the reporter, and today Kim Haeshin said that she would finish the article and publish it after the interview.When he heard this story, CEO Kim\u2019s head went blank.\u00a0he called manager Cha and Lee Wooyeon and yelled at them to come back to the office quickly.\u00a0After hearing the explanation at the office, Lee Wooyeon tried to stand up from his seat, saying okay, with an expression like it was no big deal.\u00a0However, after hearing the voice in the file that CEO Kim had heard, his expression hardened.Usually, the reporter\u2019s voice was legally protected and goes through voice alteration when it goes on air, so nobody cared about it.\u2018This\u2026\u00a0Isn\u2019t it similar to Mr. Inseop\u2019s voice?\u2019 As Manager Cha said cautiously, CEO Kim said, \u201cYeah,\u201d and nodded.Lee Wooyeon remembered that Choi Inseop returned home with the key that day, and manager Cha showed up very late, waiting for him the next day.Why did Choi Inseop, who was so meticulous, who wrote everything down in his notebook, didn\u2019t come back that day, even though he took the key with him?\u00a0In fact, after returning, he might have returned without leaving the key.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes gradually darkened.CEO Kim, who felt\u00a0 that the atmosphere was unusual, tried to call Choi Inseop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon stopped him.\u00a0If Choi Inseop knows something, it\u2019s no use calling him now.Then, to CEO Kim, who was screaming what to do, Lee Wooyeon asked him to give him only six hours.\u2018I\u2019ll get everything sorted out in six hours, so apply for an embargo.\u2019Having said that, Lee Wooyeon searched the office warehouse, found a rope and a shovel, and put it in his bag.\u00a0To CEO Kim, who was thinking about what he was going to do with it, Lee Wooyeon asked to borrow his fastest car.\u201cAre you crazy, are you crazy?\u201d CEO Kim shouted like a whale, but Lee Wooyeon told him to shut up and asked for the car key with a smile on his face.That was the reason why he waited eight hours for Lee Wooyeon, who took a shovel and borrowed a Ferrari.He applied for an embargo, but he didn\u2019t know how long it would work.\u00a0Unless Kim Haeshin brought something far greater than the story she was going to expose, Lee Wooyeon was over.\u201cIs it only for Lee Wooyeon?\u00a0Shit, but is it over?\u00a0Our company is going public next week, so what do you think?\u201dCEO Kim jumped up again and vomited his anger as he walked around the room.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have taken him in.\u00a0Black-haired beasts should not be taken in recklessly, but I\u2019m crazy.\u00a0I\u2019m possessed by that shiny face, oh my gosh, I\u2019m crazy.\u201d\u201cNow, there is no use in regretting what happened years ago.\u00a0Let\u2019s just turn ourselves in first.\u201dManager Cha came up with the most realistic alternative.\u201cSurrender?\u00a0That bastard, I\u2019ll turn myself in to see if that bastard was right!\u00a0I\u2019m sure he ran away in my Ferrari. You crazy asshole, my Ferrari! My Ferrari! My Ferrari that I haven\u2019t ridden even 10 times yet!\u201d\u201cYour Ferrari is here.\u201dCEO Kim snatched the car key flying from behind his back in the air.\u201cHey, Lee Wooyeon?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m late.\u00a0It suddenly rained.\u201dLee Wooyeon said as she shook off the water that had fallen on his clothes.\u00a0CEO Kim grunted as if he was about to run out of breath and grabbed his clothes.\u201cWhere were you and what are you doing now?\u00a0Huh?!\u00a0And where did you go and what did you do\u2026\u00a0What is this, blood?\u201dCEO Kim became pale as he saw the blood on the end of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s suit sleeve.\u201cDon;t worry.\u00a0It\u2019s not my blood.\u201d\u201cHey!\u00a0This! You bastard!\u00a0It\u2019s not your blood, that\u2019s why I\u2019m worried!!!!\u201dWhen CEO Kim collapsed by grabbing the back of his neck, manager Cha quickly approached him and supported him.\u201cCEO.\u00a0Then, before you kill Lee Wooyeon, the CEO will die first.\u201d\u201cHey, Manager Cha, him, kill him.\u201d\u201cThe president has to kill him.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u00a0You bastard, someone please kill him!\u201dLee Wooyeon made a disappointing expression and folded his arms.\u201cYou\u2019re too much.\u00a0To those who have been working hard to solve the case.\u201d\u201cSolve?\u00a0What are you trying to do?\u00a0In the first place, you didn\u2019t know Kang Youngmo\u00a0\u2026\u00a0this wouldn\u2019t have happened if you hadn\u2019t hit him!\u201dEven in the midst of yelling in anger, CEO Kim himself adjusted the volume of his voice.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took off the jacket he was wearing, threw it on the sofa, and began to untie his tie.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cChanging my clothes.\u00a0Do you have one more suit here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I only have the mourning clothes you borrowed last time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dHaving said that, Lee Wooyeon took off his shirt and threw away the pants he was wearing.\u00a0No matter how manly he was, he had no hesitation in wearing a brief.\u00a0Wearing a hanging black suit, Lee Wooyeon spoke with an unconcerned face.\u201cCall Kim Ha-shin and tell her to go and do exclusive coverage of the culprit who hit Kang Youngmo in the head, because he is now at the Gangnam Police Station.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe culprit has been caught.\u00a0No, he didn\u2019t get caught, but he went to confess.\u201d\u201cWha, what are you talking about?\u00a0Are you going to confess?\u00a0In,in mourning clothes?!\u201dIf that was the case, the situation in which Lee Wooyeon was wearing a black suit made sense.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon, who heard the words of Manager Cha, put on a serious expression, asking what he meant.\u201cWhy me?\u00a0When did I say I hit Kang Youngmo?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dYou did it\u00a0you bad bastard.When the two looked at each other with strange eyes, Lee Wooyeon said with an innocent face which had no shame in it.\u201cThere is no evidence.\u00a0You can\u2019t do that to someone who doesn\u2019t have proof.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe criminal went on his own feet to confess, so contact Kim Haeshin.\u00a0It will be the best scoop.\u201d\u201cWho is the culprit?\u201d\u201cFrom that time, it was the Korean-Chinese who smashed my head in Gangwon-do and threw me into the lake.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha.\u00a0They said that they hit Kang Youngmo\u2019s head like that.\u00a0It\u2019s such a coincidence that it seems like a lie.\u00a0Oh right.\u00a0Later, when the police call to investigate what happened before that, just tell the truth as it is.\u00a0That\u2019s what happened then.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0What did you do to those Koreans?\u201dRecalling the blood stains on the cuffs, CEO Kim barely asked.\u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything yet?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I am so glad that the culprit has been caught.\u00a0It\u2019s just that he\u2019s ready to confess.\u201dWhile looking in the mirror and wearing a tie, Lee Wooyeon opened his eyes slenderly and smiled.\u00a0It was such a pretty smile that it would be enough to exclaim that it was a really beautiful smile if someone was watching the scene right now and muted the sound.However, it was only a creepy smile to CEO Kim and Manager Cha, who had to listen to all of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s rotten words in an enclosed space.\u201cIf that bastard with Kim Haeshin is that one now, he\u2019ll shut his mouth for a while.\u201d\u201cWh, what if someone hears you, haha\u2026 please be careful.\u201d\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m going to talk prettily in this situation?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you and Kim Haeshin?\u00a0Have you ever touched her? I wonder if she is doing this with a grudge.\u201d\u201cWho touches whom?\u00a0Even if you give me a bitch like that, I won\u2019t eat it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dSomeone shut his dirty mouth. upCEO Kim glared at Lee Wooyeon with an expression that looked like he was about to collapse at any moment.\u201cLend me a car.\u00a0This time, something hard to notice.\u201d\u201cWhich car is inconspicuous among my cars!\u00a0There is no such car!\u201dIt was CEO Kim, who had already suffered a lot with the Ferrari.\u00a0Of course, the most comfortable car he had was the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, so his words were not entirely false.\u201cGet in my car.\u201dManager Cha took the car key out of his pocket and threw it at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took it and put it in his pocket and winked. At the look that he gave him, which looked like it was straight out of an ad, goosebumps began to appear. Manager Cha wiped his sweaty palms on his clothes.\u201cWhere are you going\u2026\u00a0\u201dCEO Kim, who did not have the energy to be angry now, asked with a gloomy expression.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon answered, wiping his ruffled hair with his hand.\u201cTo the person who I think knows me best in the world.\u00a0I don\u2019t think he knows the most important thing yet.\u201dAfter speaking, Lee Wooyeon put on a black mourning jacket and left the office before CEO Kim caught him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

54Chapter 54Translated by NaralaraEdited by NaralaraAfter organizing his luggage, Inseop looked around the room one last time.\u00a0If he meets with reporter Kim Haeshin this afternoon and goes to the airport at night, this would be the end.\u00a0All expensive items such as refrigerators, desks, and monitors were donated to a nearby orphanage, so there were very few left in the house.\u00a0There was too much data about Lee Wooyeon left on the computer, so he decided to just take it with him to the United States.Now all he had to do was clean up the board.Choi Inseop remembered the day he first bought the board and put it on the wall when he came into this house.\u00a0He put a lot of information about Lee Wooyeon on this board and nailed it, deciding that he would inevitably catch his weakness.In the middle of the board, there is a picture of Lee Wooyeon throwing away the wallet after leaving the alley.\u00a0He hasn;t taken it off since he took the picture that day.\u00a0Inseop blankly looked at Lee Wooyeon in the picture.There was a man with a different face from the Lee Wooyeon he knew.\u00a0Jennie said this was Philip\u2019s true form, but Inseop still couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Seriously, I am the greatest idiot in the world.\u201dInseop sighed and ripped the pictures of Lee Wooyeon from the board one by one.\u00a0The photo of that day, which was placed in the middle, was well placed in the secret pocket of the notebook.\u00a0As he was organizing the photos, he found the file he was supposed to give to reporter Kim Haeshin and looked at the photos in it one by one.In the photo, Lee Wooyeon was walking, eating, driving, and kissing a woman.\u00a0Inseop took out the picture of them kissing.After putting the other three photos in the file, Inseop took them out again.\u00a0Among the three pictures, Lee Wooyeon was looking at a woman affectionately, and he removed it.\u00a0He was thinking about putting the other two sheets in, but he started to contemplate again between the two.Would it be better to give the one where they\u2019re going by car, or would walking together be better?\u00a0Which one would look like a less romantic person?After thinking for a while, Inseop chose a picture of the two of them walking down the street and put them in the file.\u00a0Done.\u00a0If this was the case, he can turn around as a celebrity colleague he knew very well.Inseop kept the file next to him.\u00a0He got up again and removed the picture from the board when he heard someone knock on the door.Who is it?\u00a0He had already been in and out of the real estate before.\u00a0Was it the landlord?Inseop tilted his head and said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d and went out to the front door.\u201cInseop, are you inside?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0this\u2026Lee Wooyeon?\u201dWhy did Lee Wooyeon come to his house?Inseop hid the picture he was holding behind his back.\u00a0No, somewhere out of sight\u2026so once\u2026\u201cAre you inside?\u201d\u201cHold on, wait a minute.\u00a0Wait a minute\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop turned around at the thought of removing the board.\u00a0But before he could finish speaking, there was a bang from the front door.\u00a0Surprised, Choi Inseop shrugged his shoulders and looked back.Once again, bang.Neatly, the doorknob and hinges were smashed and the door fell to the floor.\u00a0Above it, Lee Wooyeon walked in with his shoes on.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cWhy are you here\u2026\u201d\u201cI have something to talk to you about, Mr. Inseop.\u201dHe had an attitude like a guest who came in after being invited.\u00a0He entered the house without taking off his shoes and began to examine the room.\u201cAre you moving?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Hold on, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cWhere did you pack up your bags and send them?\u00a0There is nothing left.\u201d\u201cGo out, go out and speak\u2026\u201dInseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and removed Inseop\u2019s hand.\u00a0He found a board stuck in the middle of the wall and pointed to it.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t those all my pictures?\u201dLee Wooyeon approached and stood in front of the board.\u00a0Inseop, realizing that there was no way to use his hands anymore, turned his head.\u201cWhen did you take all of this?\u00a0Wow.\u00a0It\u2019s really no joke.\u201dLee Wooyeon looked at the photos with an innocent face like a child.\u201cIs this a year ago?\u00a0Inseop, since when have you been chasing me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cAre you going to keep the data separately?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked while looking through the files organized by year.\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t touch it!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0It\u2019s all about me anyway, so how about looking at it a bit?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u00a0No.\u201dIt was no use.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took the file in hos hand and began to scan it thoroughly.\u201cHahahahaha.\u00a0There\u2019s everything.\u00a0Did you even collect these things?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWhat is Inseop\u2019s true identity?\u00a0No, should I call you Peter?\u201dThe moment the name Peter came out of his mouth, Inseop\u2019s blood froze cold and he couldn\u2019t even breathe properly.\u201cWhat is that?\u00a0Have you already packed up your bags to go back to America?\u201dLee Wooyeon tapped the luggage bag with the tip of his shoe and asked.\u00a0Inseop couldn\u2019t even make eye contact with him.\u00a0All he could do was grab the hem of his trousers with trembling hands and do his best not to fall on the spot.\u00a0When Inseop did not respond, Lee Wooyeon opened the bag and looked through the luggage inside.\u201cAre you going to take your computer hard drive too?\u00a0If you take it like this, it will break.\u201dLee Wooyeon said as he tapped the computer hard drive that Inseop had wrapped between his clothes with his fingertips.\u201cWhat are you doing here to leave and go to America?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIs there a lot of data about me here too?\u00a0Really?\u201dBecause it was true, Inseop did not respond at all.\u00a0No, he couldn\u2019t.\u00a0This situation was so frightening and embarrassing that he couldn\u2019t breathe properly.Lee Wooyeon found the passport in his luggage, unfolded it, and began to read it.\u201cTwenty-four years old, and American.\u00a0Who did you learn Korean from?\u00a0It was almost perfect.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWhy? You\u2019re afraid I didn\u2019t even know this?\u201d\u201cUh, how\u2026\u00a0when\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Choi Inseop\u2019s hem.\u00a0When he ripped it off with force, the buttons on his shirt fell down on the floor.\u00a0Inseop was embarrassed and tried to fasten the hem of his shirt with his hand, but he could not hide the clear surgical scar on his chest.\u201cI saw this.\u00a0When you showered at home.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cSo I thought that Choi Inseop on the document saying he was physically healthy would not be this Choi Inseop.\u201dIt was unexpected.Then, almost at the beginning of the job, Lee Wooyeon knew that he was a person using a false name.\u00a0But, why didn\u2019t he say anything?From Inseop\u2019s expression, Lee Wooyeon whispered softly as if he had read what he was thinking.\u201cI thought it didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0\u2018Cause I\u2019m gonna cut you off anyway\u00a0But it\u2019s starting to matter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cBut now I don\u2019t care and I can\u2019t let it go.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled brightly.\u00a0Inseop liked the way he smiled brightly on the screen, but now he can\u2019t say that he liked it.It was like watching the scariest horror movie in the world alone in a dark room.\u00a0He wanted to close his eyes and turn off the TV, but his body was frozen stiff that he couldn\u2019t, and it was such a terrible moment when scary scenes unfolded in front of his eyes.Lee Wooyeon picked up a file with Kim Haeshin\u2019s name on it.\u00a0He looked at the photos placed next to the file and the photos inside, one by one, and snorted.\u201cIs this the picture you want to hand over to Kim Haeshin?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I don\u2019t mean to give her everything\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you pick the one that came out best?\u00a0Did Kim Haeshin send Inseop?\u00a0She wanted you to investigate?\u201d\u201cNo!\u00a0It\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cThen what?\u00a0You and Kim Haeshin are fucking doing this together, so did you do what that bitch told you to do?\u201dInseop doubted his own ears.\u00a0This situation, with such vulgar words pouring out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth, felt like a scene from a movie far away.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t even know her\u2026.\u201d\u201cHave you been threatened?\u201dWhen he hit the nail on the head, Inseop flinched his shoulder and raised his head. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth was strangely raised. He continued affectionately with a smile that seemed to convey his anger to his opponent.\u201cI don\u2019t know what that motherfucker knew, so you thought of shutting her up?\u201dLee Wooyeon reached out and brushed Inseop\u2019s messy hair up.\u00a0His fine black hair ran through his fingertips.\u00a0Goosebumps rose up his spine.\u00a0His jaw trembled and his teeth clashed.\u00a0It was only now that Inseop could feel the words that Lee Wooyeon was a bad person with his whole body.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes were gracefully curved like a crescent moon.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not\u2026\u201d\u201cYou saved me three times and sold me to that fucking bitch?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026\u00a0\u201dWith a snap, Inseop\u2019s body collapsed to the floor. Before he realized that it was Lee Wooyeon\u2019s beautiful hand that hit him on the cheek, his hair was bent and caught.Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting in front of Inseop with his knees bent, pushed his face closer and asked.\u201cIf not, what is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u00a0 I am\u2026\u201d\u201cIf not, what is it?\u00a0What are you?\u00a0Tell me with your mouth what the hell you are.\u201dIt felt like all his hair was being pulled out.\u00a0It hurt.\u00a0It hurt so much that he felt like crying.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon, who was questioning him like this, was so scary that he could not even dare to shed tears.Lee Wooyeon looked down with cold eyes as Inseop trembled and licked his lips.\u00a0He thought he would feel a little better after beating the Korean-Chinese bastards, but instead of that, he felt a lot worse than before he came here.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon yelled at Choi Inseop, who still couldn\u2019t say a proper excuse.\u201cSay it with your mouth!\u201d\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u00a0\u201dTears welled up in Inseop\u2019s eyes and ran down his cheeks.\u00a0As tears touched the lips, moisture seeped through the gaps in his dry, bloody lips.Like a mermaid who was forcibly dragged by people\u2019s hands and thrown to the ground, Inseop was wriggling and unable to utter a proper word.\u00a0That made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mood worse.\u201cWhy can\u2019t you speak?\u00a0Do you have anything to say?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you just pretending to like me by pretending to be my fan like that and staying by my side to sell some of those photos to reporters?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know where to start or what to say.\u00a0In Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, where should he deny, where should he apologize, and what should he do, his terrified mind was not at all organized.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything to say, shall I go to the police?\u00a0If you bring Choi Inseop, whom you borrowed your name from, and we can talk together, things will be sorted out.\u201dThe tone was a kind invitation, but the content inside was a sharp threat.\u00a0Inseop turned white and shook his head.\u00a0In any case, he did not want to cause any harm to the person he borrowed his name from.\u201cNo.\u00a0no.\u00a0It\u2019s all just me, he\u2019s got nothing to do with this.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop desperately protected the person who lent his name, Lee Wooyeon raised his eyes fiercely and asked.\u201cWhat is your relationship with that person?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0No relationship.\u00a0He just\u2026 he needed money, and I\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cI needed the name Choi Inseop,\u201d Inseop answered with a weeping voice.\u00a0Choi Inseop was his real name.\u00a0He deliberately chose someone with the same name.\u00a0He was even scammed when he went to a broker who told him to connect them.\u00a0The owner of the name he borrowed after hard work was a student on leave of absence, taking care of his girlfriend due to an incurable disease.\u00a0He promised to work under his name for only three months on condition that he would not cause any problems.That was all.\u00a0Inseop did not want the lives of strangers to be ruined because of him.\u201cReally, it has nothing to do with it.\u00a0I am\u2026\u00a0just by myself\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy alone?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.Why?\u00a0Why?Among all the people he met, Choi Inseop was the one person he had lots of questions about.\u00a0When he realized that people\u2019s emotions are not understandable, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t ask the question why.\u00a0It was because in most of the cases, people did not understand the reason anyway.However, the question of why followed Choi Inseop\u2019s actions.\u00a0Whenever he couldn\u2019t understand his behavior, he became curious enough to get annoyed.\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hair and asked, as if chastising a child who had made a mistake.\u00a0Inseop only trembled with a bluish face, but when he did not answer, Lee Wooyeon asked again.\u201cWhy did you do that? I\u2019m curious.\u00a0I\u2019m really curious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t answer, I\u2019ll call Choi Inseop and ask.\u00a0Would he have just lent his name to someone who he has nothing to do with?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon said that and tried to stand up, Inseop desperately grabbed the hem of his shirt.\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019ll tell you.\u00a0I, all me, Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Tell me\u00a0so I can understand.\u201dLee Wooyeon wiped Inseop\u2019s tearful cheek with his finger and asked for an answer.\u201cA friend\u2026 She liked you\u2026\u00a0Jennie, my friend, is, is dead.\u00a0I didn\u2019t trust my friend\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh, I didn\u2019t believe her\u2026\u00a0when my friend died, she\u2019ll be by my side\u2026\u00a0, received a letter after the death of my friend.\u00a0Because of you, you put my friend in trouble\u2026\u00a0, my friend committed suicide\u2026 that if you don\u2019t, I won\u2019t trust you forever\u2026so, I, I made my friend die\u2026\u201dInseop trembled like a drowning dog, gibbling with contradictory words.\u201cAre you doing this because of your friend, that is, just because of what your friend said?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop nodded. Tears hung between his eyebrows, blinking several times to see if he could see well, and nodding his head constantly.\u201cDid you come to Korea because of that friend?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cSo, you collected my data, stalked, took pictures, became a manager\u2026\u00a0and risked your life to save mine?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t all because of Jennie, but Inseop responded that way.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon shut his mouth for a moment and looked straight at him, then burst into laughter.\u201cHahahahaha.\u00a0Hahahaha, me, really.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHahahahaha, damn, am I supposed to believe you now?\u201dHis clenched fist broke the sink leg and it collapsed with a bang.\u00a0Inseop was terrified, gasping for breath, and clasped his head with both hands.Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s chin with his hand and forced him to make eye contact.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0If you have a brain, you have to lie properly if you want to lie\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s real.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t convince me with such a nonsensical, third-rate novel.\u00a0Right?\u00a0Rather, say you like me, and that\u2019s why you followed me all the way from America.\u00a0So you stalked, gathered data, and even was my manager.\u00a0Damn it, wouldn\u2019t it be better to say that Choi Inseop came all the way here because he wanted to get fucked in the ass by me?\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u00a0No, I really\u2026\u00a0\u00a0I hate Lee Wooyeon\u2026 therefore\u2026I have to hate you\u2026\u201dHe should have hated him, but he didn\u2019t.\u00a0If he had found a weakness, he should have reported him without looking back, but he couldn\u2019t.\u00a0He should have trusted Jennie, but\u2026 he didn\u2019t do that either.\u00a0Inseop could not achieve anything in Korea and was about to leave.\u00a0He was trying to return to the United States with the time he had to work hard to believe in Jennie without achieving anything.Lee Wooyeon got up and kicked the sink with his feet.\u00a0A thick wooden panel shattered with a few kicks.\u00a0Inseop was afraid of Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He was so frightened that he had no intention of stopping him, of running away, or of any thought.Lee Wooyeon, who stopped kicking, turned to Inseop.It didn\u2019t look like he was angry or annoyed.\u00a0It was expressionless with nothing.\u00a0His face, as white as white paper, gave a creepy feeling.Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop and held out his hand.\u201cI will count to five.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cGive me a reason that makes sense during those five seconds.\u00a0Otherwise, whether it\u2019s the bastard who lent you your name, your dead friend, or whatever, I\u2019ll bring them all and let them tell me why you made me so fucking stupid.\u00a0Say it properly.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2026\u201d\u201cFive.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0A friend, because he likes Philip, Jennie, blonde and a little chubby\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cFour.\u201d\u201cShe got an invitation to a party and went there, but it was not, people poured filth on Jenny\u2026\u201d\u201cThree.\u201d\u201cJennie, she\u2019s dead, my friend, so, you, you lied to my friend, so I, I should have trusted her\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cTwo.\u201d\u201cIt really is, it really is.\u00a0It\u2019s not a lie.\u201d\u201cOne.\u201dLee Wooyeon finished the countdown.\u201cFirst, let\u2019s start by killing the real Choi Inseop.\u201dNo! Inseop clung to his feet. Even knowing that killing people was an exaggeration, Inseop was frightened by the words. If Lee Wooyeon was left as it is, it seemed like something big would happen to Choi Inseop, who lent his name. The real Choi Inseop needed money, and he needed a name. It was sheer greed to choose the name Choi Inseop. He really wanted to stand in front of Lee Wooyeon with his Korean name, not someone else\u2019s name. Since Lee Wooyeon won\u2019t know Peter anyway, he won\u2019t remember that Peter\u2019s Korean name is Inseop.\u2026\u00a0But he could not say that there was no hope at all that he might remember him faintly.\u00a0He wanted to somehow prevent the damage to the other people because of his useless greed.\u201cMy name is Choi Inseop.\u00a0It\u2019s originally Inseop.\u00a0So I chose it.\u00a0He has nothing to do with it.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t even pretend to listen.\u00a0Choi Inseop was desperately clinging to him.\u00a0Now all he could think of was that he had to stop him somehow.\u201cI like you. I did it because I like you. I like you so much that I\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter to anyone. It\u2019s all me, so\u2026 I like you.\u201dInseop did not think that the day would come when he would confess his feelings to this man.\u00a0When he liked him as Peter, he was frustrated before he even realized it was love, and when he came to Korea and met him again, he was in a situation where he shouldn\u2019t have liked him.\u00a0But there were times when he dreamed of confessing to him.\u00a0He used to wake up from a dream while approaching the boy who was sitting by the window reading a book to confess his feelings.In real life, he may not be able to confess to him, but in his dreams, he carefully looked forward to telling him that he liked him someday.But now, this situation was a scene that he had never thought about, neither in his dreams nor in reality.\u00a0Drowned in tears and runny nose, trembling with fear, Choi Inseop desperately told Lee Wooyeon that he liked him.\u201cI like you.\u00a0Because I like Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m a stalker.\u00a0I\u2019m the only one who needs to go to the police station because no one else is bad.\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.\u00a0Inseop nodded his head as his neck fell out.\u00a0Right now, protecting the person who lent him the name Choi Inseop was the top priority.Inseop was very afraid of Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Even though he was talking, he felt like he couldn\u2019t communicate.\u00a0As long as he could stop him, he thought that it had nothing to do with pride.\u201cI really am\u2026\u00a0It is true.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt happened because I liked Lee Wooyeon with a bad heart.\u201dInseop covered his face with his palms.\u00a0His sincerity poured into the words he said to escape the situation.\u00a0It all started because he liked Lee Wooyeon and Philip with a bad heart from the beginning.\u00a0If he hadn\u2019t liked Philip, he wouldn\u2019t have been so harsh on Jennie, and she wouldn\u2019t have made such an extreme choice when she was left alone.In the end, the worst was him.\u201cI will burn all the photos.\u00a0So\u2026\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201c\u2026For that Choi Inseop\u2026 please\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop put his hands together and knelt down.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s hand, which was broken while trying to save him, and was wearing a cast, caught Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes.\u00a0The unfamiliar feeling that had been forgotten warmed up again in his heart.\u00a0He thought Inseop\u2019s crying face was pretty, but looking at it now, it was not pleasant at all.\u00a0Seeing him shivering and turning white with a face full of tears and a runny nose felt like hell.\u00a0The most disgusting thing was the thought that the third-class garbage story that Inseop had brought up earlier as a reason might be true.\u00a0Even now, seeing how he cries and clings to the person who he borrowed his name from for fear of harming him, that asshole would do more than enough for his friend.Lee Wooyeon was really annoyed at the fact that it wasn\u2019t him who made Inseop into such a moron, but someone else.\u201cDo you like me that much?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon asks, Inseop made a sullen face and nodded his head.\u00a0Seeing that, Lee Wooyeon swallowed a smirk.If he really liked him, he would have the will to look pretty in front of him, but he was like a nerd who didn\u2019t even have the minimum courtesy.\u201cDid you follow me all the way from America because you liked me?\u00a0To stalk me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cHow much do you like me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cHow much do you like me?\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s face turned bright red.\u00a0Tears flowed down, he had a runny nose, and he was hot to the face, it was a spectacle.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon laughed at Inseop, bent over and wiped his face with his hand.\u201cHow much did you like me that you do this damned thing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cYou want me to believe that? If you say you like me, should I trust you? Do you think I\u2019m the same idiot as Inseop?\u201d\u201cI like, I like you.\u00a0I, I\u2019m serious.\u201d\u201cOkay, then.\u00a0Let\u2019s see if you\u2019re serious.\u201dLee Wooyeon tapped Inseop\u2019s cheek a couple of times with the back of his hand, and then stood up.\u00a0He lowered his zipper.\u00a0He ripped open his underwear and pulled out a piece of flesh from it.Choi Inseop widened his eyes and watched what he was doing.\u201cConvince me.\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\u201cWhether you\u2019re serious or not, try to convince me.\u201dInseop still didn\u2019t understand what Lee Wooyeon was talking about, so his eyes widened.\u201cYou came all the way here because you like me.\u00a0Let\u2019s see how much you like me.\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed his flesh in front of Inseop.\u00a0Only then did Choi Inseop realize how to convince him.\u00a0A light of astonishment flashed across his pale, bloodless face.\u201cWha, what\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Did you just say that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I, I\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you came this far because you like me, you can show me this kind of sincerity.\u201dChoi Inseop, who had lost all strength in his body, sat back down.\u00a0He shook his head and waved his hand, but Lee Wooyeon was stubborn.\u00a0A large hand approached and grabbed Inseop\u2019s trembling chin.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pushed his thumb into Inseop;s mouth and lowered his lower jaw, opening his mouth.\u201cI\u2019ll see how well you do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Ah, no, I\u2026\u201d\u201cNo? you don\u2019t want to?\u00a0You?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0If he had to decide whether he likes him or not, he would say I like him.\u00a0He suppressed his heart, thinking that he shouldn\u2019t like him, but Inseop liked Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Because of that heart, in the end, he decided to go back to America with everything.But now the situation was beyond his mind.\u201cThen do it.\u00a0Convince me with your body how much you like me.\u201dLee Wooyeon opened Inseop\u2019s mouth and pushed his own flesh into it.\u00a0At the sudden touch of a large piece of flesh in his mouth, Inseop was physically nauseous and backed away.\u201cUh\u2026ugh.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hair again.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to hurt anyone, do it well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dAgain, Lee Wooyeon put his finger in and opened Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u201cOpen your mouth, yes.\u00a0To the end, swallow it.\u201dInseop closed his eyes tightly and opened his mouth as wide as possible, taking in the man\u2019s flesh.\u00a0Even though he didn\u2019t do anything, the feeling of the flesh growing in his mouth kept giving him goosebumps.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s head and did not let him go.\u201cSuck it well.\u00a0Yes, like that.\u201dLee Wooyeon made Inseop\u2019s head move back and forth with his hands.\u00a0Every time the red, swollen genitals touched the tip of his neck, Inseop\u2019s tears welled up.\u00a0Saliva dripped between his gaping lips.\u00a0A squeaking sound echoed loosely in the empty rooftop room.\u201cIs it so good?\u00a0Do you like me so much that you drool while sucking on a man\u2019s dick?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked subtly.\u00a0Inseop couldn\u2019t answer because of the flesh filling his mouth.\u201cLick it all the way with your tongue.\u00a0Ha\u2026 you suck it like it\u2019s very delicious.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tenacious gaze, which seemed to eat him up, scanned Choi Inseop\u2019s face.\u00a0Even when he opened his mouth as wide as possible, Inseop couldn\u2019t even move his tongue properly at the sensation of the flesh rushing in.It was a clumsy oral.\u00a0The orals he received as a teenager were many times better than this, it was so bad.\u00a0It was at a level where all he had to do was keep his mouth open and his head moved back and forth.It was done to fuck Choi Inseop over, who was lying like a dog to escape the situation.But strangely, it didn\u2019t feel bad.\u00a0It was very, very good to see him grimacing and taking his big cock into his mouth.Looking down at the way it moved in and out of Inseop\u2019s small mouth, Lee Wooyeon licked his lips.\u00a0Tears welled up on Inseop\u2019s black eyelashes.Feeling his gaze, Inseop lifted his head upward.\u00a0The tears that were welling up flowed down his cheeks.Then, blood rushed to the bottom of Lee Wooyeon.\u201cFuck\u2026\u201dHe grabbed Inseop\u2019s small head with both hands and began to shovel quickly.\u00a0The feeling of the hardened flesh touching the inside of his mouth was amazing.\u00a0Unable to follow the rough movements, Inseop tried to pull his face back, but Lee Wooyeon never let go.It felt like he was killing him.\u00a0It felt like he was pounding into a virgin\u2019s hole.\u00a0Choi Inseop gasped for breath and scrambled his arms.\u00a0The stiff, hot flesh brushed Inseop\u2019s tongue and teeth.\u201cHa\u2026is it good? Are you going to die because you like it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u00a0!\u201d\u201cFuck\u2026\u00a0ha.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s head and pierced his genitals to the inside of his neck.\u00a0Putting Inseop\u2019s face close to his pelvis, Lee Wooyeon trembled.Hot semen was ejected into Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u00a0The dripping liquid wet Inseop\u2019s lips and chin.Lee Wooyeon opened her eyes narrowly and\u00a0 the languid ejaculation.\u00a0Inseop pushed him away and stood up.\u00a0He ran straight to the bathroom, grabbed the toilet and began to vomit.\u201cUgh\u2026\u00a0ugh\u2026\u00a0uhh\u2026\u201dInseop vomited while holding on to the toilet for a long time due to the nausea that came up over and over again.\u00a0Inseop, who was exhausted from having to vomit, sat down on the bathroom floor.\u00a0When he looked up, Lee Wooyeon was standing next to the bathroom door, watching him.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dIt was a voice so friendly that it was hard to believe that he was the same person as the man who had just been brutally fulfilling his desires.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop bit his lip and bowed his head.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t even tell if what he was feeling right now was sadness, anger, or shame, as his mind was confused and complicated.\u00a0Tears welled up.\u00a0Inseop covered his face with his trembling hands and prayed so that he could hide his shame.\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dDone.\u00a0Now it\u2019s over.Everything is over.\u00a0He won\u2019t have to feel these big emotions that he can\u2019t handle anymore.\u00a0Well done, well done, well done\u2026 \u00a0Now it\u2019s over.Inseop sat down on the cold bathroom floor and cried, soothing his heart.Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop like that, raised him up, and whispered softly.\u201cThen try to do better next time.\u201dLeaving behind the devil-like sweet whisper, Inseop\u2019s consciousness faded away.\u00a0What followed was darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tsk.\u201dLee Wooyeon frowned and clicked his tongue.\u00a0He said, \u201cGive it to me,\u201d and grabbed Inseop\u2019s blood-stained hand.\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not okay.\u00a0You\u2019re bleeding.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t don\u2019t touch me.\u201dWith the hammer in hand, Inseop trembled and shouted.\u00a0With one hand in his pocket, Lee Wooyeon, who was watching him, started to laugh like crazy.\u201cHahahahaha.\u00a0What?\u00a0Are you threatening me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t, don\u2019t come near me.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha.\u00a0Really, you\u2019re a funny guy.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and stretched out his hand.\u00a0Inseop, frightened, shook his head and stepped back.\u00a0But because of the door that was behind his back, he had nowhere else to retreat.Lee Wooyeon straightened the hammer in Inseop\u2019s hand and said,\u201cIf you\u2019re going to hit it, you have to hit it like this. You can only break a bone with that. You have to take a sharp shot to break it at once.\u201dIt was as if he was teaching him a math problem that he didn\u2019t know.At that time, when the sheet wrapped around his body slid down, Inseop panicked and dropped the hammer and grabbed the sheet.Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue and picked up the hammer that had fallen to the floor.\u201cYou\u2019ll get hurt..\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI had a job in the morning, so I went out and bought some food.\u00a0Are you not hungry?\u201dInseop blinked and looked at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Inseop was completely confused by his attitude as if it had never happened in the first place.Did he not wake up from his dream yet?Inseop patted his cheek with his hand and slapped it lightly.\u00a0The tingling pain told him that this is now a reality.If so, maybe he\u00a0\u2026\u00a0What happened to his head after the accident?\u201cAre you not hungry?\u201d\u201c\u2026What about my clothes?\u201d\u201cI threw it away.\u00a0I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll run away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be doing that for a while.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon\u2019s unusual answer came back, Inseop had to admit that he didn\u2019t have a head injury and that this was a reality.\u201cUh, give me the clothes back.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.\u00a0He had a strange expression.\u201cI have to go back.\u00a0The flight time\u2026\u201d\u201cThis one?\u201dHe asked, taking out Inseop\u2019s passport from his pocket.\u00a0Inseop reached out to snatch his passport, but Lee Wooyeon raised his hand above his head first.\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me.\u00a0I never gave you permission to go back.\u201dLee Wooyeon said calmly.\u00a0Inseop felt a chill and grabbed the sheet with his hands.\u201cI\u2019m hungry, so let\u2019s eat first.\u201dHaving said that, Lee Wooyeon left Inseop and sat down at the kitchen table.\u00a0Inseop, who had no desire to eat and only wanted to get out of this situation, followed him and asked for his clothes again.\u201cGive it back.\u00a0My clothes\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cSit down please.\u00a0The food here is not salty and light. I bought it because I thought it would not hurt your stomach..\u201d\u201cReturn my clothes\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon kicked the chair opposite him.\u00a0Then he smiled and said to Inseop.\u201cSit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop carefully grabbed the seat with his injured hand, raised the chair with his left hand, and sat down.\u00a0With a satisfied expression on his face, Lee Wooyeon laid out the food he had bought on the table.He put the abalone porridge in front of Inseop and handed him a spoon.\u201cPlease eat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be good for your health. My anger has not subsided yet.\u201dWithout thinking, Inseop couldn\u2019t help but grab the spoon in his hand.\u00a0Although he mechanically put the porridge in his mouth little by little, Lee Wooyeon was sitting opposite him, so he was concerned and Inseop did not feel any taste.\u00a0Besides, the sheet kept falling off and he was holding it.Everything was unreal.\u00a0This moment of eating at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s house with a sheet wrapped around his body, and the events that hit him like a storm yesterday.As Choi Inseop was slowly eating porridge with a stiff face, Lee Wooyeon suddenly spoke.\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s silk.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe sheet is silk, so it flows down.\u00a0But you don\u2019t have to hold it like that.\u00a0I don\u2019t get excited when I see a man\u2019s body.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dRather, because of those words, the memories of yesterday came to mind, and Inseop almost vomited the porridge he was eating.Originally, he was eating it without knowing what it tasted like, but his taste buds came back.\u00a0When he put the spoon down on the table, Lee Wooyeon narrowed his eyes and said,\u201cBecause of the sincerity of the person who bought it, please eat more.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I have no appetite.\u201d\u201cIf someone you like bought it for you, wouldn\u2019t it be right to eat everything?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cEat it.\u201dIt was a curt command.\u00a0Choi Inseop, wanting to cry, lifted the spoon and put the porridge in his mouth.\u201cOh right.\u00a0Have you seen this?\u201dLee Wooyeon opened the newspaper he brought along with the food on the table and asked.\u201c\u2026What\u2026\u00a0!\u201dA light of astonishment filled Choi Inseop\u2019s eyes as he read the headlines of the newspaper.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who saw it, asked what happened.\u201c\u2026\u00a0the culprit\u2026\u201d\u201cHe surrendered.\u00a0The culprit.\u00a0He went on his own two feet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dUnbelievable, Inseop rubbed his eyes with his hands and looked at the newspaper articles again and again.\u00a0In the newspaper, there was a special report about the criminal who confessed that he had hit Kang Youngmo from behind and stole his money.\u201cHow\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe culprit\u2026 Why\u2026\u00a0surrendered\u2026\u00a0\u201dIn fact, what he wanted to ask was, why did a person who was not the criminal surrender for something that he did not do?\u00a0However, Inseop could not say that he saw Lee Wooyeon coming out of the alley.\u201cWell.\u00a0Is your conscience pricked?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThere must be something.\u00a0We don\u2019t even need to know that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cBut aren\u2019t these criminals familiar?\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon said, the photo of the criminal in the newspaper had his face covered with a mask and a hat, but it felt strangely like he had seen it somewhere.\u201cIt was very strange to say that it was the Korean-Chinese who struck me in the back of the head at that time.\u00a0So I went to the police station earlier, wrote a report and gave an interview.\u201dLee Wooyeon calmly explained the situation.\u201cIn the first case, there were many witnesses and there was a lot of evidence, so the crime was established immediately. In the second case, there were no witnesses and there was no evidence, but it is a similar case and there is a confession that they did it, so it is easy to establish a case. People don\u2019t think there\u2019s a man who\u2019s done it only once. There are people who haven\u2019t done it, but there are no people who have done it only once. So naturally, if you add a confession, this is what they did\u201dEvery time Lee Woo-yeon added an explanation in a soft voice like a flower petal, Inseop got goosebumps and sweated.As Jennie said, Lee Wooyeon was a bastard.\u00a0no\u2026 More than that.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know how to explain, he was such a bad guy.\u201cDo you know who wrote this article?\u201dInseop looked at the reporter\u2019s name written in the place where Lee Wooyeon was pointing and opened his eyes.\u00a0Whether Inseop\u2019s reaction was interesting, Lee Wooyeon sat with his arms crossed and watched him.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You don\u2019t understand why Kim Haeshin suddenly changed her mind and turned her palms over like this?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat he needed was an article, not me.\u00a0There are no permanent comrades and no permanent enemies in this field of work.\u201dThe article written by Kim Haeshin praised the professional spirit of actor Lee Wooyeon, who was attacked by an illegal immigrant and did not say anything for fear that the filming of the drama would be disrupted.There are no permanent enemies and no permanent comrades.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words echoed in Inseop\u2019s ears.\u201cWhat kind of interview were you planning on having with reporter Kim Haeshin?\u201d\u201c\u2026She said that she would be interviewing the reason why I quit.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0I\u2019m curious about that too.\u00a0You\u2019re not going to go to the US to study civil service.\u201dInseop bit his lip in embarrassment.\u00a0Excuses such as studying to become a civil servant or because his father is ill no longer work for Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Fortunately, Lee Wooyeon did not know that he had witnessed the scene that day.\u00a0Inseop thought that he was lucky enough to put the picture in his notebook, and came up with an excuse.\u201cJust\u2026it was hard.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBeing next to Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u201dIt was true.\u00a0The more Inseop was next to Lee Wooyeon, the more confused he became, and he even forgot what he was here for.\u201cYou liked me so much, you chased me all the way here and even worked as a manager, but you just quit because it was hard?\u201dBut the opponent wasn\u2019t that kind of person.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon sharply dug into the gap, Inseop stuttered and answered.\u201cThat day\u2026\u00a0Lee Woo-yeon and the woman\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that day.\u201dLee Wooyeon nodded, remembering that Choi Inseop had come to see him the night before he said he would quit.\u201cYou\u2019re going to stop because of that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDid you just quit because I had sex with a girl?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dInseop knew that he had no options.\u00a0The best thing he could do now was to match Lee Wooyeon to his rhythm as he wanted.\u00a0He must never be a nuisance to the college student who lent him the name.Lee Wooyeon frowned and made a troubled expression with a frown.\u201cAt the same time, you were threatened by Kim Haeshin.\u00a0Well, you don\u2019t have to do an interview.\u00a0Anyway, the reason Kim Haeshin wanted to interview Mr. Inseop was something else.\u201d\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201d\u201cThe person who found and reported Kang Youngmo and Inseop\u2019s voice were very similar.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo she was probably trying to get the media to share something similar to eyewitness accounts.\u00a0It almost got me in trouble.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon clicked his tongue softly.\u201cWhy would you do something that would be intimidating like that?\u00a0Even though you were threatened, you sold me to Kim Haeshin?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing.\u201dInseop was so shocked and scared that his stomach was stinging, but Lee Wooyeon, who was so happy, continued to talk with a smile on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment to know that your feelings for me are only that much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201dHe didn\u2019t have anything to say other than I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Not knowing how this breathtaking game of lies would end, Inseop trembled with his fingertips and quietly swallowed dry saliva.\u201cStill, yesterday was a little more believable.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and ran his fingers across Inseop;s lips as if he were running them down.\u00a0It was very clear what that short movement meant.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s face heated up at once.\u00a0Inseop quickly lowered his head and grabbed the sheet with both hands as if embracing it.\u00a0His body trembled again.\u201cDo you want to go to America?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dInseop nodded vigorously.\u00a0Right now, he just wanted to get a taxi, run to the airport, and catch a plane to America.Lee Wooyeon stretched out his hand.\u00a0His fingers ran down Inseop\u2019s cheek.\u00a0He gently touched Inseop\u2019s face as if stroking a small and lovely being.\u201cActually, I was really, really angry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad the truth came out, but I almost got fucked because of Inseop and Kim Haeshin.\u201dThe whereabouts of the Korean-Chinese who made him like that were already known.\u00a0He was so busy with his schedule that he just left it, not that he forgot.\u00a0It was something he thought he would have to go down by himself after a while and either break his leg or bury him somewhere.\u00a0If Choi Inseop hadn\u2019t stabbed him in the back like that in cooperation with Kim Haeshin, there would have been no remorse for the crime of the Korean-Chinese hitting Kang Youngmo.\u00a0As a result, it was fortunate that everyone was happy, but Lee Wooyeon was very dissatisfied with Inseop\u2019s choice, which put him in a corner.\u201cI can\u2019t trust Mr. Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was no excuse for that.\u00a0It would be a strange situation if Lee Wooyeon were to say that he believed in him.\u201cSo I can\u2019t let you go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0what?\u201d\u201cHow can I let someone who I don\u2019t believe in leave with that material?\u201d\u201cI will dispose of all the materials now.\u201d\u201cHow do I know you haven\u2019t hidden more?\u00a0Your name, age, and personal information are all lies.\u00a0Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThen I will go to the police station.\u00a0I will pay for my sins.\u201d\u201cLee Wooyeon\u2019s manager turned out to be a scammer.\u00a0It\u2019ll be a good article.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop, who had been silent, asked in a calm tone.\u201cThen\u2026What do you want?\u201dEven if he were sued for identity theft or stalking, there was nothing he could do.\u00a0Inseop decided that he would endure all the sins he had committed.\u201cYeah.\u00a0I\u2019m curious about that too.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his chin and narrowed his eyes to answer.It was true.\u00a0He was contemplating on what to do with Inseop now.\u00a0Letting Choi I-seop go, aside from being anxious, he couldn\u2019t do it because he was so angry.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even think about handing him over to the police.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to hand over the fish he caught.\u00a0Besides, it was fun to watch him cling to him desperately saying he liked him, so he wanted to enjoy it for a while.\u201cI like it.\u201dAfter contemplating for a while, Lee Wooyeon finally opened his mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInseop swallowed and waited for the sentence to come out of his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019ll come back to work as my manager again.\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201d\u201cWork next to me and make sure I trust you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cHow much Inseop likes me, I\u2019ll be watching for that, so I ask you to desperately hang on to me.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon said one by one, Inseop\u2019s face grew pale.\u201cIt\u2019s one month.\u00a0Within a month, if I trust you, I\u2019ll return your passport and ID.\u00a0Of course, I won\u2019t even touch Choi Inseop, who you borrowed your name from.\u201d\u201cWhat is that\u2026\u201d\u201cBut even after a month has passed, if I still don\u2019t want to trust Inseop, then I\u2019ll call you and Choi Inseop, and then we\u2019ll talk together.\u201dInseop\u2019s lips trembled.\u00a0It was a nonsensical proposal in the first place, so he didn\u2019t answer anything and just looked at Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You can\u2019t?\u00a0What\u2019s so difficult?\u00a0I wish you could show me a little bit of that damn sweet love of yours that made you chase me all the way from America.\u201d\u201cUh, you wouldn\u2019t believe me anyway, would you?\u201d\u201cWe never know.\u201dIt was a game with an obvious end.\u00a0In the game that started with the brand of defeat, Inseop knew he could never win.Lee Wooyeon just wanted to torment him.\u00a0Just like yesterday, once was enough.\u00a0Inseop couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201dInseop looked at Lee Wooyeon and said that. He didn\u2019t want to stay here for even a second, let alone a month.\u201cPlease return my passport and clothes.\u201d\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\u201cIt is mine.\u00a0Please return it.\u201dAlthough he was choked with fear and his hands and feet had no strength, Inseop gathered all the courage he could and said so.\u00a0In the midst of this, a fairy tale about a woodcutter who ironically hid a fairy\u2019s clothes came to mind.\u201cI can give it to you, but\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon slurred the end of his speech.\u00a0Laughter broke out at the end of the muffled voice.\u00a0It was a beautiful and soft laughter that sounded like a piano melody.\u00a0The smile slowly lifted from his face, revealing his original expressionless face.\u201cAfter you go, what will Choi Inseop do?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop realized it then.The fact that it was not the woodcutter who hid his clothes, but the wild tiger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His mother took his hand and wept profusely.\u00a0He cried too.\u00a0He kept crying until the doctor gave him a sedative and he fell asleep.When he returned home from the hospital, someone came to see him.\u00a0A woman in a shabby outfit introduced herself as Jennie\u2019s aunt.\u00a0Aunt Spencer.\u00a0She was the one who Jennie always spoke of.\u00a0Saying she couldn\u2019t attend Jennie\u2019s funeral because she had been on a trip to Africa, she handed Jennie\u2019s diary to him with tears in her eyes.\u00a0After saying she wanted him to keep it and she would\u2019ve liked it that way, Aunt Spencer left in an old navy blue wagon.\u00a0He returned to his room and opened the diary.\u00a0There, Jennie\u2019s daily life was written with a hard-to-recognize handwriting.\u00a0Things about a prince, a fight with her mother, a story about being bullied at school, etc.\u00a0It was a series of contents that contained words like her wanting to die, wanting to kill, and again, wanting to die.The only happy reality in it was her time spent with Peter.\u00a0It was written at the end of the diary.\u2018If Peter would trust me again, I could do anything.\u2019He realized that she had fallen into despair because he had let go of her hand.\u00a0So he lost Jennie.Choi Inseop pressed the corners of his eyes with his palm.\u00a0Tears welled up just thinking about the past.Jennie wrote a diary which was full of curses towards Philip.\u00a0Even on the days she talked about the prince\u2019s kindness towards her, she wrote in her diary about Philip ignoring her and tormenting her.\u00a0At first he didn\u2019t believe Jennie\u2019s diary.\u00a0However, as time passed, it became difficult to ignore her loneliness.\u00a0Every time Jennie wrote something about Philip, she poured love and curses on him.\u00a0She said that Phillip was tormenting her, and that the only way out of this suffering was to kill him.\u00a0In the diary, she wrote on the last day that she was apologetic towards Peter, that if he would believe her, and that Philip had tormented her, so she asked him to take her revenge.\u00a0Whether it was true or not was a fact only Jennie knew.Since she passed away with the truth, there was nothing he could do but believe in it.But he could do nothing.Inseop covered his face with his palms.\u00a0His lack of power was the same then and now.\u00a0He was the same as before, naked and sprawled out with no strength at all.What the hell did he do? What did he do?\u00a0He believed Jennie\u2019s words, and after coming here, he only harmed other people.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0really\u2026\u201dHe thought it was amazing and he laughed out loud.\u00a0If he told anyone about this, it was obvious that they would only laugh at how stupid his revenge is.\u201cJennie\u2026\u00a0I came here to get revenge\u2026 But I got\u00a0caught.\u201dAs he spoke, he became even more miserable. He worked hard to sharpen the blade of revenge and ran to kill the monster, but he couldn\u2019t even use it properly and the knife was taken away and he turned into the monster\u2019s hostage.\u00a0Even worse, he was so moved by the terrifying monster that after he tried to find his weakness, he just tried to return home.If someone made this into a children\u2019s book and sold it, even if they sold it for 100 won a book, they won\u2019t be able to sell even five.\u00a0How in the world can there be a story like this?Inseop covered himself with the sheets all the way to the top of his head and constantly blamed himself.\u00a0Then, as soon as he closed his eyes for a moment, it was as if he had fallen asleep.\u00a0When he woke up to the sound of the door opening in his sleep, he heard a gentle sigh of a man from the bedside.\u201cI\u2019m amazed.\u201dThat was understandable.\u00a0Obviously, the two of them were having a fight right now, but when he got home, he found that the other person was sleeping on the sofa with only a sheet on.Inseop pretended to be asleep and waited for Lee Wooyeon to leave.\u00a0He heard the sound of the heavy door of the dressing room being opened to change clothes.\u00a0Inseop thought about getting up and running into the dress room and stealing any clothes and leaving, but he was afraid of the consequences.No, obviously he wouldn\u2019t even be able to run a few steps, as he would be grabbed by his hair and dragged around, and this time he would be locked up in the dressing room.Taking a deep breath, Inseop erased his brief dream of escaping.\u00a0After changing all the clothes, Lee Wooyeon came out to the living room.\u00a0Contrary to Inseop\u2019s expectation that he would take water from the refrigerator and go inside, Lee Wooyeon walked back to the sofa.\u00a0Then he lifted Inseop while holding the sheet.Choi Inseop screamed inwardly.\u00a0Still, whenever Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingertips touched his body, he got chills and goosebumps.\u00a0He wanted to avoid being held in his arms like this.\u00a0But from the beginning, he pretended to be sleeping, so he struggled and couldn\u2019t get out.Lee Wooyeon threw Inseop on the bed.\u00a0Feeling the presence of him lying next to him, Inseop tensed up inside the bed.\u201cGood night.\u201dThe light in the room went out.\u00a0Inseop breathlessly waited for the man lying next to him to fall asleep.\u00a0Soon, the sound of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breathing evened out.He lowered the sheet slightly with his fingertips, and Inseop looked to the side.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019e eyes were closed and he was asleep.\u00a0Inseop slowly got down from the bed.Lee Wooyeon put down his cell phone\u2026\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop found Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cell phone near the table, and ran quickly to grab it.\u00a0Once he calls his parents, tell them all is well\u2026 He wasn\u2019t, but he had to tell them not to worry.He quickly dialed the number and Inseop crouched, covering the phone with his hand.\u00a0After ringing five or six times, he heard his mother\u2019s voice saying \u2018Hello\u2019.<It\u2019s me, Peter.><Peter?\u00a0Where are you?\u00a0I couldn\u2019t even call you.\u00a0You said you\u2019ll come yesterday but there was no contact.\u00a0What the hell happened?>As expected, his mother asked questions in a worried voice.\u00a0Inseop silenced his voice as much as possible and whispered.<Something happened, but I\u2019ll be back soon.><What?\u00a0I can\u2019t hear clearly.\u00a0Peter, speak out loud.><Some work\u2026\u00a0!>The phone swung over his head.<I don\u2019t think I will be able to come back for a while because I have some work at the company.\u00a0Please understand.\u00a0I\u2019ll hang up now.>After finishing the call in fluent English, Lee Wooyeon pressed the power button of the cell phone and threw it on the sofa.\u00a0Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon with a look as if he had seen a ghost.\u2026\u00a0No, he was more afraid of Lee Wooyeon than a ghost right now.When did he come out?\u00a0He couldn\u2019t even hear his footsteps\u2026\u201cI think I said no calls.\u201d\u201cUh, I have to call my mother once every three days.\u00a0I promised.\u201d\u201cWhat does that have to do with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Lee Wooyeon also has a mother, so can you try to understand?\u201dAs a last resort, he tried to explain using \u2018mothers\u2019 that everyone has.\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to my mom on the phone for, let\u2019s see, more than four or five years?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe was someone whose emotions did not work.\u00a0Inseop quelled his despair and fixed the sheet.\u201cDon\u2019t be such a virgin.\u00a0I won\u2019t be excited by your naked body.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop bowed his head as his ears grew bright red.\u00a0A strange smile spread across Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips when he saw it.\u201cWhat?\u00a0Are you really a virgin?\u00a0Haven\u2019t you done anything?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve been living as a virgin until now because you want to try it with me.\u201d\u201cOh, no\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe didn\u2019t live as a virgin because he wanted to try with Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He had been living with his virginity because he had never been on a date with anyone because he was not popular.\u201cMr. Inseop, which part of me do you like so much?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInseop pursed his lips and turned his head to the side.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon reached out and forced his head towards him.\u201cWhich part of me do you like?\u201dA fierce chill flashed in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smiling eyes.Desperate to answer just anything, Inseop replied that he liked his shoulders.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s broad.\u201d\u201cAh, so the last time\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled brightly as he recalled pleasant memories and continued.\u201cWould you like me to put it in?\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u00a0If you were a woman, I would have put it in at least once.\u201d\u201cNo, no, no way.\u201dHe wanted to avoid this kind of atmosphere.\u00a0Inseop grabbed the sheet and walked to the sofa.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon persistently followed.\u201cHave you ever thought of me?\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201d\u201cWhat did you imagine?\u201d\u201cAh, I don\u2019t.\u00a0It\u2019s not like that.\u201dHe shook his head resolutely, but Lee Wooyeon did not listen.\u201cDid you imagine me putting it in your back?\u00a0Thinking like that, you will satisfy your desires alone, right?\u201dInseop, who sat in the corner of the sofa, covered the sheets all the way to the top of his head and expressed that he did not want to talk any more.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed the sheet.\u00a0Choi Inseop tried his best to hold on, but because he was someone he could not overpower, the sheet was quickly taken away by Lee Wooyeon.Inseop, who had become naked, floundered like a drowning person and tried to cover himself with the hem of the sheet.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon gently pushed him away and said,\u201cAnswer me.\u00a0Then I will give it to you.\u201d\u201cAh, I don\u2019t.\u00a0I don\u2019t think like that, I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u00a0You said you like me so much.\u201dIt was peaceful for three days, so Inseop thought that Lee Wooyeon was protecting his last pride.\u00a0He was just now realizing that it was a huge mistake.\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say that you have a platonic love at this age, do you?\u00a0Well, is that it?\u00a0Even then, you sucked my dick very nicely.\u201dLee Wooyeon said vulgar words casually.\u00a0His voice was so sweet and supple that it felt unrealistic because of the large gap between the content and the voice.\u201cSorry.\u00a0This is because I woke up in a very bad mood because of Inseop.\u201dIt was a voice that was not at all sorry.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s annoying because I can\u2019t even bring a woman home.\u201d\u201cThen just let me go\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn it, shut your mouth when I say something nice.\u201dLee Wooyeon threw the sheet he was holding on the floor.\u00a0Inseop shrugged and moved his body to the corner of the sofa.\u201cHow can I trust you and just let you go?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, then, how will you trust me and use me as a manager again?\u201dHe was afraid to die, but he had to say it.\u201cSo I\u2019m asking you to believe me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cConvince me that what you say is true.\u00a0By any means.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026Why are you saying that?\u00a0I am\u2026 Lee Wooyeon\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I like you\u2026\u00a0if you believe that\u2026\u00a0what will\u2026 change?\u201dIn a crying voice, Inseop asked a question that had been in his mind for days.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said, \u201cWell,\u201d and sat down next to Inseop.\u00a0Inseop was so nervous that whenever Lee Wooyeon moved, his heart sank.\u201cWhat will change?\u201dLee Wooyeon mumbled, talking to himself with a terrifying expression on his face.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201dThat\u2019s what he just asked.An unhappy cry echoed in Inseop\u2019s chest.Lee Wooyeon, sitting next to him, stared at Inseop and repeated \u2018what would be different\u2019. Because he was really curious about it, Inseop was more frustrated because he didn\u2019t know what Lee Wooyeon was thinking.Sitting with his back on the sofa, Lee Wooyeon was immersed in thought for a long time.\u00a0Eventually, he looked at Inseop with his soft smile restored and said,\u201cI\u2019m curious to see what will change, so let\u2019s find out.\u201d***When Lee Wooyeon took Choi Inseop to the office, the expressions on the faces of CEO Kim and Manager Cha were that of astonishment.\u00a0Manager Cha grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm and asked if he was okay, if there were any injuries, and what happened.\u00a0As Inseop was hesitating because he could not answer, this time CEO Kim ran in and grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand and questioned him like a rapid-fire cannon.\u00a0What happened to you and Kim Haeshin, why did you suddenly quit your job and contact Kim Haeshin, tell me what happened in the meantime, etc.In the end, the question baptism ended only after Lee Wooyeon led CEO Kim into the representative room.\u00a0When it was just the two of them standing outside the office, Manager Cha cautiously opened his mouth.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cStill, looking at your face\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst.\u201dManager Cha was muttering to himself, and he lowered his head, unable to say what he wanted to say: It\u2019s not inseop, this is the worst.\u201cInseop, do you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201c\u00a0\u2026Roughly.\u201d\u201cI kept calling, but your phone was turned off.\u00a0I was worried.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0sorry.\u201dInseop had not seen his cell phone since that day, so he had nothing to say.After a moment\u2019s hesitation, the manager lowered his voice and whispered.\u201cI\u2019m from the same agency, so it\u2019s a bit awkward to say things like this, but Mr. Inseop\u2026\u00a0I prefer not to have anything to do with Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0It looks like I\u2019m already involved.\u201d.\u201cLee Wooyeon, somehow, has a good image and is good at acting, and that\u2019s\u2026 So\u2026\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Run away.\u201dBefore Cha could finish his last meaningful words, the door to the representative office opened and Lee Wooyeon exclaimed in a bright voice.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u00a0Come and sign the contract.\u00a0Hurry up.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dManager Cha and Inseop stared at each other\u2019s faces without saying a word.\u00a0There was a lot of comfort and sorrow in those silent gazes.After signing the contract in the representative office, the people in the office congratulated Inseop.\u00a0\u2019Congrats on coming back, why did you quit, you\u2019re back, so let\u2019s do our best in the future.\u2019Receiving the congratulatory words, Inseop answered their greetings with a smile, not wanting to cause them worry.\u00a0The female employee in charge of the schedule handed Inseop Lee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule and a rough plan for one month.\u201cThe details will come down once a week.\u00a0Even if I don\u2019t explain it, you\u2019ll know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u00a0Thank you.\u201dInseop took the paper with a depressed face and put it in his pocket.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to write it down in your notebook?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cYou always wrote down everything I said in your notebook.\u00a0When I saw that, I thought Inseop was very cute.\u00a0It\u2019s like seeing my son, who is an elementary school student, going to school and writing down every word.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0A, a good son.\u201dInseop smiled awkwardly and shook his head.\u00a0The notebook, along with his passport, was buried deep in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s safe.\u00a0Maybe he didn\u2019t see the picture in the notebook, so Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t say a word about it.\u00a0It was a fortune out of misfortune.\u00a0No, the misfortune was too great for it to be called a fortune.As he stood in front of the elevator door and waited for the elevator to arrive, Lee Wooyeon quietly whispered to him\u201cLaugh a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLike a dog brought to the slaughterhouse, what is it?\u00a0Am I forcibly dragging you, Mr. Inseop?\u00a0That\u2019s not it.\u201dAs if he was saying \u201cI feel a little bad, but do you want to go get some fresh air?\u201d Lee Wooyeon told Inseop to persuade him because he was curious about the results.It was absurd, Choi Inseop protested, asking what the heck that meant.\u00a0He said he was wrong, but \u2026\u00a0he wanted take revenge for what he did to his friend\u2026\u00a0he even said he did this because he like Lee Wooyeon, but if he says he won\u2019t believe him anyway, at this point, he was just trying to harass him.Of course, all these words were barely said, his voice trembling, sounding like an ant was crawling out of his mouth.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who nodded his head seriously, saying yes, that is it, said as soon as Inseop finished speaking in a weeping voice.\u2018So, when will you start working?\u2019It was an infinite loophole.\u00a0No matter how much he tried to hold on, Lee Wooyeon only interpreted it as he liked.\u00a0In the end, he made Choi Inseop reply that he would return to the manager\u2019s job.The first thing Inseop did when he came out with the underwear and clothes that Lee Wooyeon had bought him was to come to the office and sign the contract.Looking at CEO Kim\u2019s pale face in a few days, Inseop could only guess how much heartache he had suffered.\u00a0CEO Kim watched Inseop signing the contract with a complicated expression.\u00a0He didn\u2019t like having someone who left once, who seemed to be having a difficult time, as Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager again, but above all, the fact that Lee Wooyeon came back with Inseop made him very uncomfortable.Of course, the most uncomfortable and worst among them was Choi Inseop.\u00a0While he promised Jennie to get revenge, he was in a situation where he would be eaten by Lee Wooyeon if he made a mistake.The only comforting thing was the picture in the notebook in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s safe.\u00a0He didn\u2019t do any harm to Lee Wooyeon with the picture, but he thought he could at least make an excuse when he went to see Jennie if he took the picture back.The biggest problem right now was to release the innocent Choi Inseop by letting the words \u201cI believe\u201d\u2019 come out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth.Inseop, who sat in the driver\u2019s seat of the van after a long time, took the steering wheel in his hands with a complicated heart.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who came in after him, closed the door and asks.\u201cWhat about music?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Shall I turn it on?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Because I like the songs that Inseop has selected for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop searched the glovebox and took out the CD he had burned.\u00a0He left it in case he needed it, but manager Cha didn\u2019t seem to have touched it.\u00a0Inseop properly took one out and pushed it into the audio.After checking the schedule, Inseop asked Lee Wooyeon.\u201cYou have time, would you like to go home?\u201dIn fact, after taking Lee Wooyeon home, he wanted to go back to his house and clean up the mess.\u00a0If the owner of the house saw it, he would have kicked him out immediately.\u00a0Inseop thought it was a good thing that he left the money in his bank account as an emergency fund. Once he handed all the money to the landlord, and entrusted it to repair it, he decided to renew the contract again.\u201cWhat are you going to do, Mr. Inseop?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do when I get home?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I will go to my house.\u201d\u201cAmerica?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice was particularly ferocious.\u201cNo\u2026\u00a0there.\u00a0The rooftop room.\u201d\u201cAh, you don\u2019t have to worry about that anymore.\u00a0Because I took care of everything.\u201dLee Wooyeon said as if he had read Inseop\u2019s mind.\u201cYou dealt with it?\u201d\u201cI threw away all your luggage and paid for the repairs.\u00a0Of course, the house will go out to someone else as planned.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then where am I going to live?\u201dIt was like a rant.\u00a0It was more difficult than picking a star in the sky to find a clean room with such a cheap house price among those close to the company.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a room.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I will find a room for myself.\u201d\u201cHow can I believe Choi Inseop and leave you alone?\u00a0What are you going to do by yourself?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m not going to do anything.\u201d\u201cI have to trust you to believe you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even have the energy to pursue it anymore.\u00a0Inseop held the steering wheel with a depressed face and sighed.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Where would you like to go?\u201d\u201cALright.\u00a0I just thought of a place to go.\u201dSaying that, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes narrowed like a crescent moon.\u00a0At the same time, anxiety crept into Inseop\u2019s heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

knocking twice, he heard a voice saying, \u201cCome in.\u201d\u00a0Just hearing that voice made Inseop\u2019s stomach ache.\u201cSunbae.\u00a0Are you all right?\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon entered the hospital room, he greeted in a friendly voice.\u00a0As soon as Kang Youngmo, who was lying down with a cast on his neck, saw Lee Wooyeon, he frowned.\u201cWhat, why are you here?\u201d\u201cSunbae is hurt, so of course it\u2019s the junior\u2019s job to come and visit.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon held out the fruit basket, the caregiver quickly took it and set it down on the table.\u201cSo you come as a junior to visit me only now?\u00a0It\u2019s really beneficial for the junior.\u00a0Who else is there?\u00a0Why is he crawling here again?\u201dKang Youngmo looked at Inseop and frowned harshly.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Are you, are you okay?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Are you here to take a look at me?\u201d\u201cVisit\u2026\u00a0I came to visit.\u201dInseop stood in the corner and backed away as far as he could from Kang Youngmo.Just seeing Kang Youngmo and Lee Wooyeon together, Inseop remembered Lee Wooyeon in the alley that day, so he couldn\u2019t manage his facial expressions properly.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon said he would visit Kang Youngmo, Inseop couldn\u2019t help but doubt his ears.\u00a0From the back of Lee Wooyeon choosing a fruit basket, Inseop thought that the person he was dealing with might not simply be a bad person.\u201cWhat else is that?\u201dKang Youngmo asked, pointing to the small flowerpot Choi Inseop was holding.\u201cOh right.\u00a0It\u2019s a visitation gift.\u201dInseop muttered as he carefully placed the small flowerpot he had bought from the flower shop below on the table.\u201cTake it away.\u00a0Where am I going to put your cheap potted plants?\u201dKang Youngmo said angrily, and the caregiver, whose face was pale, quickly put the flowerpot on the corner by the window.\u00a0Expensive flower pots sent by PDs and various broadcasting officials were lined up in the hospital room.Rather than Lee Wooyeon, who he could not understand, Inseop thought that Kang Youngmo, who was the same inside and outside, so that people could avoid it, was better.\u201cDid you hear about the drama?\u201d\u201cI heard.\u201dDirectors, broadcasting stations, and investment company officials gathered and had a heated discussion about whether to cast another actor instead of Kang Youngmo, who was injured, or whether to postpone filming until he gets well.\u00a0The director and broadcasting station wanted to hire another actor because filming could not be postponed indefinitely, and the investment company officials wanted to continue with Kang Youngmo.\u00a0It was a natural result since the company to which Kang Youngmo belonged to invested.\u00a0The position was divided in half and the opinions were hardly narrowed down, so it was expected that the filming would be difficult.\u00a0At that time, Lee Wooyeon, who had been quietly listening, spoke in a quiet but strong voice.\u00a0\u2019If you don\u2019t go with Kang Youngmo sunbaenim, I\u2019ll get off this drama too.\u2019The director looked at him with a face that asked what the hell he was talking about, and other people also stopped him, but Lee Wooyeon calmly continued.\u2018If we are on the same boat, we must go together until the end.\u00a0Filming has started, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to switch to a different actor at this point.\u00a0In this drama, I think there is no one but Kang Youngmo for Lee Wonsik.\u2019In the end, filming for the drama was delayed until Kang Youngmo got better.\u00a0Naturally, the broadcasting station was in a fuss to fill in the hole in the drama arrangement.\u00a0Another drama, which was supposed to come in as a follow-up, hastily started filming, and the problems were concluded.Kang Youngmo\u2019s first reaction after hearing all the stories was \u2018Is Lee Wooyeon crazy?\u2019\u00a0When they were on set, there was no problem between the two of them but on the outside, it was impossible to say that they were good friends.\u00a0Kang Youngmo argued over and over again, and Lee Wooyeon pretended to be gentle with him, but he never bent down.\u00a0The person who knew it better than anyone was Kang Youngmo.He instinctively sensed that Lee Wooyeon was rotten inside even though he had a soft smile on his face.\u201cWhat on earth were you thinking of going on with me?\u201d\u201cI wanted to finish the drama with sunbaenim.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Are you afraid that the ratings won\u2019t come out if it\u2019s not me?\u201d\u201cThat reason is also great.\u00a0Of course.\u201dThe two looked at each other and smiled.\u00a0Inseop felt like his energy was being sucked out, so he was only drenched in a cold sweat.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m really glad that the culprit was caught.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u00a0But there are all sorts of weird coincidences.\u00a0The culprit who hit you hit me?\u00a0Can you believe it?\u201d\u201cI know, right.\u00a0There really are such coincidences.\u201dKang Youngmo looked at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He firmly believed that he was definitely doing something.\u201cWhat I have realized while living in this world is that there are no coincidences.\u00a0Even if there is a fabricated coincidence.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0There is.\u00a0Accidents happen.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled, pointing his finger at himself.\u00a0Kang Youngmo looked at him with an expression that seemed to ask what he was bullshitting about.\u201cHahaha.\u00a0I\u2019m glad that you look healthy.\u00a0I am relieved.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0what?\u00a0Relief?\u201dWith a cast on his neck and a broken leg, Kang Youngmo was unable to properly control his body.\u00a0There, Lee Wooyeon was saying that his heart was at ease with a very happy voice.\u201cDoes this look healthy to you?\u201d\u201cI worded it wrong, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting better.\u201dInseop realized that it was his true intentions, not his mistake.\u00a0Kang Youngmo, unable to overcome his temper, wrinkled his face and glared at Lee Wooyeon, found Inseop restless next to him, and fired an arrow of attack at him.\u201cHey, you. Go and buy a drink.\u201d\u201cYess?\u00a0What\u2026\u201d\u201cThe coffee shop in the basement of the hospital has great fresh fruit juice, so buy one there.\u00a0No syrup.\u201d\u201cWhat should I buy you for?\u201d\u201cStrawberry.\u201dWithout giving any money, Kang Youngmo shamelessly asked him to run an errand.\u00a0As Inseop was about to leave the hospital room, Lee Wooyeon gently grabbed his arm.\u201cI will buy it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou stay here.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2026\u201dA slight chill appeared in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smiling eyes.\u00a0Inseop dropped his shoulders and nodded his head.\u201cShould I buy you the strawberry juice?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Do whatever you want.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter which of the two went out for Kang Youngmo.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon left the hospital room, Inseop was sweating more than before because of the awkwardness.\u00a0When even the caregiver aunt woke up to eat, she was almost stunned.When Choi Inseop was confused in the corner of the hospital room, Kang Youngmo called him.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDid you tell Lee Wooyeon that you were beaten that day?\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dInseop did not speak of that day.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon asked who hit him, he just replied that he fell.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know if he would believe it, but Inseop didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell Lee Wooyeon?\u00a0I wondered if that asshole took the brick and hit me on the back of my head.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dCold sweat dripped down.\u00a0He thought it would be better for him to buy a hundred glasses of fresh fruit juice and carry it around.\u00a0What the hell was this?\u201cReally?\u00a0If you tell him, you will not be able to set foot in this world from that day.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201dIn his heart right now, he wanted to beg, to please, please, get him out of this world.Kang Youngmo said groaned and said fuck..\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Should I call the nurse?\u201d\u201cHey, there\u2019s a urinal under there.\u00a0Wash it.\u201d\u201cUnder the bed?\u201dInseop asked, holding up a small plastic bottle placed from under the bed.\u201cYes.\u00a0Wash it and bring it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a very pleasant feeling, but he changed his mind, thinking, \u201cThe patient is a patient, so of course I have to listen.\u201d\u00a0However, Kang Youngmo continued with a very blatant request.\u201cI want to pee.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want to pee.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Should I call the caregiver?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t wait. I feel sick.\u201d\u201cThe nurse\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you want the nurses to do? I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re paid for this, but do you know how talkative they are?\u201d\u201cWhere did the manager go\u2026\u201d\u201cI fired him, he was annoying.\u00a0What are you doing?\u00a0I want to pee.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe should\u2019ve gone to buy the fresh fruit juice.\u00a0He should have gone.Inseop was crying and feeling bitter, but he lowered Kang Youngmo\u2019s hospital gown and put the urinal there.\u201cHey, you asshole.\u00a0Do it right.\u00a0It\u2019s all leaking.\u201dKang Youngmo was so angry that Inseop was startled and pushed it back into the urinal.\u201cTurn your head.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dIt was a sight he didn\u2019t want to see anyway, so Inseop meekly turned his head to the other side.\u00a0The sound of liquid pouring into the empty vat was heard.Embarrassing.Inseop struggled to think differently, waiting for this unpleasant time to pass.\u00a0At that moment, the door to the hospital room opened and Lee Wooyeon came back with a canned drink in one hand.\u201cThey ran out of fresh fruits, so I just\u2026\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon looked at the two with surprised eyes, Kang Youngmo became annoyed and shouted.\u201cWhat.\u00a0Don\u2019t you even knock?\u00a0Ignorant bastard.\u00a0Close the door.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dWhen Lee Woo-=yeon came in, Inseop became even more nervous.\u00a0In the end, it was Inseop\u2019s responsibility to give Kang Youngmo his clothes after finishing his chores, and even to wash the urinal.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Are you feeling uncomfortable?\u201dStill, as a courtesy to the patient, Inseop asked Youngmo to adjust his dress.\u201cYou really don\u2019t have any guts.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d ask you to pee and I\u2019d pee on your face.\u00a0Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201dKang Youngmo, who was laughing with his mouth wide open, immediately cried out in pain when his neck started hurting.\u201cFuck, seriously.\u00a0It\u2019s not enough for them to be grinded.\u00a0How dare these trashy things hit me?\u00a0Why are you crawling into a foreign country?\u00a0It\u2019s annoying.\u201dLee Wooyeon, a trashy fellow who crawled into another country, lightly responded, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cBy the way, A manager should be like this, he should be a little stupid, he\u2019s my type. Kids these days don\u2019t have much guts, so they\u2019re going to quit soon.\u201dInseop sighed a little when he heard Kang Youngmo saying that he had just fired him because he was annoyed a while ago.\u2018\u2026\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m glad he\u2019s okay, but I really don\u2019t like this person.\u2019Kang Youngmo nodded and continued speaking, as if he suddenly had an idea.\u201cLee Wooyeon, lend me your manager.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u00a0What do you mean?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a manager, so it\u2019s a bit inconvenient.\u00a0I\u2019ll get one soon, but whatever.\u00a0This bastard listens well and is obedient, so he feels like a good manager.\u201dKang Youngmo pointed at Inseop with his chin.\u201cNo.\u00a0He is my manager.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and refused.In the past, he might have cheered for Lee Wooyeon internally, but to Inseop today, Kang Youngmo, or Lee Wooyeon, they were both the same.\u201cYou, as well, change managers a lot.\u00a0It\u2019s perfect for a bastard who doesn\u2019t have any guts.\u201dInseop suddenly became a bastard with no guts, but he could not refute it.\u00a0Even if he added stupid idiot to an asshole without guts, he had nothing to say.\u201cLend him to me for three weeks, no, just one month.\u00a0Let him do some errands.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201dNo, he didn\u2019t agree to that either.\u00a0Kang Youngmo\u2019s eyes widened wildly when he replied that he didn\u2019t like the suggestion.\u201cWhat?\u00a0No?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I hate it.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t like sunbae now?\u00a0Do you hate that an injured sunbae asks you to borrow your manager?\u00a0Ha, really, has it become easier to act these days?\u00a0Huh?\u00a0Does your sunbae look like a piece of shit?\u201dIt was a strange logic.\u00a0Choi Inseop started to feel upset when Kang Youngmo started fighting.\u00a0He just wanted to get out of this uncomfortable place.\u201cHow can you borrow my manager?\u201d\u201cYou have a lot of other managers.\u201d\u201cSunbae-nim has a lot of other managers.\u00a0I have only Mr. Inseop.\u201dThere is only Mr. Inseop.Even knowing that there was no meaning in it, Inseop\u2019s face heated up.\u201cWhy is he standing there with his face blushing?\u00a0Are you two really not like that?\u00a0How nasty.\u201dA mean smile spread across Kang Youngmo\u2019s lips.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled.\u201cIsn\u2019t that really what it is?\u00a0So why don\u2019t you let me borrow him?\u00a0Fuck, are you afraid I\u2019ll eat that bastard?\u201dKang Youngmo\u2019s sarcasm grew stronger and stronger.\u00a0Inseop, who felt insulted, bowed his head and prayed that this visit would be over as soon as possible.\u201cSunbae.\u00a0Don\u2019t make such jokes.\u00a0I asked you that day too.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and took Kang Youngmo\u2019s hand.\u00a0The expression on his face, which had a soft smile on it, faded.\u00a0With an expressionless face like a pale white paper, he looked down at Kang Youngmo and continued.\u201cPlease be more careful in the future.\u201dHe spoke softly like a butterfly sitting on a flower, but when he realized the truth behind those words, Inseop\u2019s spine became cold.Kang Youngmo\u2019s eyes widened, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smile returned again.\u201cAnyway, please don\u2019t bully Inseop too much.\u00a0As I said that day, he is my manager.\u201d\u201cFuck, what do you know about that day?\u00a0I can\u2019t even remember what I said when I was drunk.\u00a0It\u2019s annoying, so get out.\u201dKang Youngmo waved her hand and asked them to leave.\u201cYes.\u00a0Then we\u2019ll just go.\u00a0Take care.\u201dLee Wooyeon said goodbye to Kang Youngmo, who was grimacing at them, and left the hospital room.\u00a0Choi Inseop also bowed his head and left the room.\u00a0As he walked down the hallway of the hospital room, the nurses and patients looked at each other, chattering.Normally, he would have passed by with a moderate smile, but now Lee Wooyeon\u2019s steps were particularly fast.\u00a0Inseop gasped for breath and walked after him, noticing that his heart was twisted.While taking the elevator down, people pretended to know him, but Lee Wooyeon only nodded mechanically and did not respond affectionately. Going to the underground parking lot, Lee Wooyeon urged Inseop, who was following him, to hurry up and come.Choi Inseop walked as fast as he could.\u00a0Later, he almost had to run after Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm as he was about to get into the driver\u2019s seat of the van parked in the corner.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201dLee Wooyeon dragged him to the back seat without saying a word.\u00a0Inseop, startled by the sound of the rear seat door closing, trembled.\u201cWhy\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you asking because you don\u2019t know?\u201dLee Wooyeon put Inseop on the seat and said while sitting next to him.\u00a0He was asking because he really didn\u2019t know, so Inseop only looked at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face.\u201cYou really go crazy for a man\u2019s dick.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cAre you touching it because Kang Youngmo asked you to touch it?\u00a0If it\u2019s a man\u2019s dick, no matter who it is, it\u2019s all good, right?\u201d\u201cAh, no.\u00a0Kang Youngmo said he wanted to pee\u2026\u00a0because he can\u2019t get up\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you accepting Kang Youngmo\u2019s fucking urine?\u00a0Inseop doesn\u2019t seem to have any guts.\u201d\u201cBecause he\u2019s a patient\u2026\u201d\u201cI left the nurse, so why are you doing it?\u00a0What did the caregiver do with money?\u201d\u201cThe nurse said no, and the caring aunt went to eat\u2026I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cWhat can you do?\u00a0So you touched his cock?\u00a0So is that why that bastard was asking to borrow Inseop?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cThen why is Kang Youngmo suddenly asking for Mr. Inseop?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked with an angry face.\u00a0His sharp eyes met and his cheeks sting.\u00a0Inseop blinked his eyes and shook his head saying he did not know.\u201cAren\u2019t you pretending you don\u2019t know anything and actually running around flirting with men?\u00a0Well, those Korean-Chinese bastards in the bathroom were the same, and the club was the same.\u00a0There must be no reason not to be attracted to Kang Youngmo.\u201d\u201cNo, I never did.\u201dIt was embarrassing.\u00a0The accident in the bathroom was such a terrible thing that if he put it on the list of memories he would like to erase in his life, it would be on his top list.\u00a0When he was with the foreigner at the club, he just asked for directions to the bathroom.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at how well you stroked him, that the ill-tempered Kang Youngmo s possesed.\u201dLee Wooyeon got on Inseop\u2019s body.\u00a0Inseop, who went pale, shook his head.\u201cTry it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0You misunderstood.\u201d\u201cI have not misunderstood.\u00a0Because I\u2019m speaking as I see it.\u201dLee Wooyeon put Inseop\u2019s hand on his groin and said.\u201cDo it.\u00a0Just like you did to Kang Youngmo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0please\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop\u2019s face quickly heated with embarrassment and anxiety.\u00a0A narrow emotion lingered in his large eyes.\u201c\u2026Someone will come.\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t even see us.\u00a0You know that.\u201dVans used by celebrities were tinted several times more black than usual cars.\u00a0There was even a curtain inside, so even if someone came close and looked inside, they wouldn\u2019t even be able to see if there was anyone inside.\u00a0It was a minimum defense measure to protect the celebrity\u2019s privacy from extreme fans.It became poison to the present Inseop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon unzipped his pants.\u00a0Inseop was able to guess what was going to happen next, so he struggled with all his might.\u201cNo, I really didn\u2019t do anything.\u00a0As a patient, so\u2026\u00a0 really.\u00a0Please believe me.\u201d\u201cI want to trust Inseop too.\u201dLee Wooyeon covered Inseop\u2019s face with the palm of his hand.\u00a0He did\u2019t see him blinking his eyes a little while ago and dabbling terribly.\u201cI\u2019m doing this because I want to believe.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to believe you, but Inseop keeps doing things that make me not believe it!\u201dLee Wooyeon forcibly pulled Inseop\u2019s hand and placed it between his legs.\u201cGet me off with your hands.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cGet me off by your hands.\u00a0Why?\u00a0Can\u2019t you do it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Please, don\u2019t do this.\u00a0Please.\u201d\u201cYou said you liked me.\u00a0That\u2019s why you said you did that.\u00a0But now, you say you can stroke another man\u2019s dick and not mine, Inseop, are you playing with me?\u201dEven now, Inseop gave his hands a lot of strength to pull them back.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon did not change his expression, holding Inseop\u2019s arm with one hand and speaking calmly.\u201cDo it quickly.\u00a0I have to get to the next schedule.\u201dIt was like standing in a long line at a cafe and begging for a quick coffee.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon intertwined his hands on Inseop\u2019s palm and made him slide it into his underwear.Inseop furrowed his brows and forcibly grabbed the half-swelled dick.\u00a0A viscous liquid came into contact with the palm of his hand.\u201cAre you just going to hold it like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHave you never done it alone?\u00a0Think of this as Inseop\u2019s and do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2026\u201dInseop had little experience of masturbation.\u00a0When he learned about sex, exercises that puts stress on the heart was prohibited.\u00a0Among the strenuous exercise was sexual excitement.\u00a0Only once, he went to a strange site on the Internet and turned off the computer with only a bunch of popups and guilt.\u00a0That night, he had a fever and was moaning through the night, but when he woke up at dawn, his pants were wet.\u00a0That was the first and last for Inseop.As Inseop murmured with his head down, Lee Wooyeon asked with a sincere voice.\u201cYou really haven\u2019t done it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNever?\u201dPositive silence returned.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon burst into laughter.\u00a0How in the world were there people like this?\u201cHahahaha, then that\u2019s fine.\u00a0This is the opportunity to learn properly.\u201dLee Wooyeon loosely overlapped Inseop\u2019s hands, then moved them up and down.\u201cThis is how you do it, without pulling too hard, just this much.\u00a0Okay?\u201dWhile pointing to something very lewd, Lee Wooyeon whispered into Inseop\u2019s ear in a clear tone as if he was reading a poem.\u201cTouch the balls under it.\u00a0Yeah, that\u2019s good.\u00a0Try rubbing the ends with your fingers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInseop felt his ears burn at the feast of lewd and vulgar words.\u00a0The edge of his ears where Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words touched was so hot that the heat of his body seemed to be concentrating on it.\u00a0The feeling of the wet pre-cum gradually increasing on his hand made the feeling of his hands moving more vivid.\u201cJust think this is Inseop\u2019s dick.\u00a0This is how you do it.\u201dAs if teaching a child, Lee Wooyeon took a deep breath from time to time.\u00a0Inseop closed his eyes tightly and moved his hand as Lee Wooyeon told him.\u00a0The sound of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s soft voice and hot breath echoed in the car.\u201cYou\u2019re doing well, a little bit more, now quicker\u2026 ha.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed his hand on top of Inseop\u2019s hand and quickly moved it.\u00a0The touch of Inseop\u2019s palm, who had not worked much, was as soft as a baby.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon suddenly thought of how soft it would be to touch Inseop\u2019s body in every nook and cranny.He reached out and tucked his hand into Inseop\u2019s clothes.\u00a0He touched Inseop\u2019s nipples with his fingertips.\u00a0Inseop, who had closed his eyes, was startled and opened his eyes.\u201cHands, get your hands off me\u2026\u00a0ack.\u201d\u201cHold on, fuck, this is the only thing I can touch.\u201dLee Wooyeon twisted Inseop\u2019s nipples hard with his fingertips.\u00a0Inseop shook his head and told him to stop, but Lee Wooyeon was no longer satisfied with just his hands.\u201cNobody told you to rest your hands, do it quickly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0But\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be touched by someone you like.\u00a0Look, it has hardened.\u201dLee Wooyeon said while touching his clearly stiff nipples with his fingertips.\u201cMen feel here too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0please\u2026.\u201dEven though he only touched his nipples a little, Inseop was in tears and didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0Instead of moving his hands, his whole body turned red and he was gasping for breath.\u00a0In this way, it was clear that the climax would not be reached even after a hundred years had passed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon briefly clicked his tongue and made Inseop\u2019s mouth open.\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because Inseop doesn\u2019t seem to be able to do well with his hands yet.\u00a0The mouth only has a hole, so open it up.\u201dInseop closed his lips and turned his head to the other side.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon sighed and forced Inseop to open his mouth.\u00a0Then he shoved his wet dick into his still-open mouth.\u00a0The sudden insertion into the mouth made Inseop choke, and he inhaled.\u201c\u2026\u00a0I like this.\u201dLee Wooyeon said while fiddling with Inseop\u2019s ear with his fingers.\u201cMr. Inseop\u2026Fuck, your mouth is fucking hot.\u201dLee Wooyeon leaned Inseop\u2019s head on the seat and moved his waist.\u00a0He grabbed Inseop\u2019s struggling hand and wrapped it around his waist.\u201cHow is it?\u00a0Do you like it?\u201dHe raised his back and asked Inseop.\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cBecause you have my dick in your mouth\u2026\u00a0How are you feeling?\u201dKnowing that Inseop\u2019s mouth was full of his genitals and he couldn\u2019t answer, Lee Wooyeon continued to ask mischievous questions.\u201cIt\u2019s the glans that are rubbing the roof of your mouth right now.\u00a0Haha\u2026\u00a0lower your tongue a little more.\u00a0Yeah. Good job.\u201dThe graceful and beautiful Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand stroked Inseop\u2019s neck.\u00a0A softer touch than he had expected touched his palm.\u00a0The more he rubbed Inseop\u2019s body, which was shaking like a wet puppy, the more he felt thirsty.\u201cWith a man\u2019s dick in your mouth, your expression is amazing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTears welling up in Inseop\u2019s eyes flowed down.\u00a0Even if he didn\u2019t want to cry, tears welled up at the hard thing that stabbed his throat.Lee Wooyeon groped Inseop\u2019s chest with his fingers and uttered sweet jokes.\u201cLick the balls too.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u00a0Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dLooking down at Inseop holding his testicles with his mouth open, Lee Wooyeon smiled softly.\u00a0He received a lot of oral.\u00a0Even a certain actress, known for having a high nose bridge, sucked his dick like a person who had been obsessed with him.\u00a0There was nothing special about satisfying cravings with the mouth.However, the clumsy and childish oral by Choi Inseop strangely ignited a fire underneath.\u00a0He looked up at him with eyes messed up with guilt and shame, and the expression on his face was exquisite.Lee Wooyeon wanted to see Inseop\u2019s face, so he made him lift his chin, and then repeated shoveling.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was rubbing his glans on Inseop\u2019s tongue, was breathing more and more harshly.Lee Wooyeon made Inseop\u2019s head stick close to his crotch, and then ejaculated his semen inside his throat.\u00a0Every time Lee Wooyeon shook his waist, fishy semen flowed out into Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u00a0As the semen flowed into his throat, Inseop coughed and removed his face.Lee Wooyeon covered Inseop\u2019s mouth with his hand.\u201cSwallow it.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cSwallow it all.\u201dInseop had a weak stomach.\u00a0It was hard to even hold the semen in his mouth right now, and he was about to die.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon persistently demanded that Inseop swallow his semen.\u201cCome on, swallow it.\u00a0Yes, like that.\u201dLee Wooyeon opened Inseop\u2019s mouth, checked for any semen remaining in it, and stroked his head.\u201cNow lick the semen on my dick.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Do I have to?\u201d\u201cLick it down to the last drop.\u00a0All of it.\u201dInseop closed his eyes and licked Lee Wooyeon\u2019s dick with his tongue.\u00a0The taste of the fishy semen that he barely swallowed began to spread sourly in his mouth.Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop by the back of his head and did not let him go until Inseop licked all the semen with his tongue.\u201c\u2026 Is it okay?\u201dInseop looked up at Lee Wooyeon, asking for permission.\u00a0When their eyes met, Lee Wooyeon licked his lips with his tongue.\u00a0At that sensual act, Inseop lowered his gaze without realizing it.\u201cIt\u2019s a little disappointing, but I have another schedule, so I\u2019ll stop here for today.\u201dThere has never been a day where he was more grateful for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s tight schedule than today.\u00a0Choi Inseop got up from his seat and pulled out his clothes.After moving to the driver\u2019s seat, Choi Inseop rinsed his mouth with the bottled water he had purchased from the center console.\u00a0Even after rinsing several times, the taste of semen seemed to remain, so Inseop grimaced.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201dInseop was startled by the voice Lee Wooyeon called from behind and turned around.\u201cIf you get caught touching another man\u2019s dick in front of me one more time, I\u2019ll break the rest of your hand.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe van parked in the corner of the parking lot began to move slowly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re not getting off?\u201dInseop got out of the car.\u00a0The footsteps following Lee Wooyeon were heavy.\u00a0He remembered hearing from somewhere that it was the most inconvenient to have to go into the same house after a fight when living in the same house as a couple.\u00a0They were not married and they don\u2019t live together in the same house, but he didn\u2019t feel comfortable having to go into the same place with Lee Wooyeon after work.Moreover, after doing such a thing in the parking lot during the day, Inseop couldn\u2019t even look at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face properly.\u00a0Even in the elevator, Inseop stood in the corner and waited to get out of the cramped space.\u00a0But as soon as he entered the house, he realized that a larger closed space was waiting for him.\u201cWhat?\u00a0Are your socks dirty today as well?\u00a0Shall I carry you and take you to the bathroom?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s clean\u2026No, not very clean.\u201dInseop looked down at his socks and muttered something.\u00a0He took off his shoes neatly and went into the house.\u201cI\u2019m taking a shower.\u201dLee Wooyeon said as he went into the bedroom.\u00a0The guest bathroom in the living room was occupied by Inseop.\u00a0Entering the bathroom, Choi Inseop stared blankly at his reflection in the mirror.\u201c\u2026Really, what are you going to do?\u201dHe tried to ask, but the man in the mirror did not give an answer.\u00a0Standing under the shower with hot water turned on, he felt exhausted.\u00a0Inseop, who was about to put on the clothes he had taken off after a quick shower, saw the clothes lying in front of the bathroom and cried out in surprise.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clothes.\u201dThe answer came from the kitchen.\u201cWh, what about the clothes I was wearing?\u201d\u201cHow will you wear the clothes you wore outside?\u00a0I\u2019m going to send it to the laundromat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dWasn\u2019t it too much?Inseop was at a loss for words at the man who brought him only one large T-shirt, and he stood blankly, not understanding his actions, so he just put it on.\u00a0Until a few days ago, he was living in this house without a single cloth, with sheets wrapped around himself, but he thought this shirt would be better than that.However, Iseop changed his mind the moment he saw the face of Lee Wooyeon, who saw him as he walked into the living room wearing clothes.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0It fits you well. That outfit..\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll fit into my bottoms, so I put them off for now.\u00a0Let\u2019s go buy some pajamas tomorrow.\u201dWhile saying that, Lee Wooyeon smiled looking at Inseop\u2019s legs that were exposed under the T-shirt.\u00a0It was not something to worry too much about, but because of that gaze, Inseop kept pulling the hem of his T-shirt down and walking.\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201dLee Wooyeon looked at the wine he was drinking and asked.\u00a0He didn\u2019t like alcohol, but on a gloomy day like today, Inseop thought it wouldn\u2019t be bad to lean on alcohol to sleep, so he nodded his head slightly.Lee Wooyeon poured the wine into a wine glass and handed it over.\u00a0Inseop, who took the glass with both hands, savored the wine little by little.\u201cCan you drink alcohol?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed his finger at the surgical scar on his chest.\u00a0Inseop quickly pulled up the hem of his robe and covered the surgical scar.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u00a0It\u2019s fine now.\u201d\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0It was originally like that.\u201d\u201cHeart malformation? Was it that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLee Wooyeon showed no hesitation while asking things that exposed the wounds of others.\u00a0That person seems to have stopped acting in front of him now.\u00a0Inseop sighed and took a sip of the wine.\u201cAre you completely better now?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me if I am perfect like others\u2026 it\u2019s not to that extent, but I can still live a moderately similar life.\u201dInseop believed that it was all thanks to Jennie.\u00a0He always thought that the heart that stopped once on the operating table had started beating again with Jennie\u2019s will, so this heart was the one that she gave as a gift.\u201cAren\u2019t you exercising too much?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to do it in moderation, but if I overdo it, it can be dangerous.\u201dEvery time he got regular checkups, he heard the doctor telling him that he was doing well, and that if he kept managing like this, he\u2019ll be able to live to a hundred years old.Lee Wooyeon frowned and clicked his tongue.\u201cHow have you been driving all night?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0That\u2019s just\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to clean up a body in my van, so please don\u2019t follow me on overnight filming from now on.\u201dInseop hesitated for a moment, not knowing whether he was worried or simply expressing that he did not want to remove a dead body, but he chose to just say thank you.\u201cThank you.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t answer.\u00a0He guessed it was probably the latter..Inseop sat in the corner of the sofa, sipping wine without saying a word.\u00a0There was only an awkward silence in the living room.\u00a0He knew that Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t turn on the TV unless he was watching a movie, but he wanted to get rid of this silence by playing something.Even before knowing Lee Wooyeon\u2019s true form, there was no smooth conversation between the two of them.\u00a0Because Lee Wooyeon wasn\u2019t the talkative type, and Inseop didn\u2019t even think about talking to him.But when he found out his true form, the thought of talking to him has long since disappeared.\u00a0Inseop wanted Lee Wooyeon to go into the bedroom first.\u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll sleep.\u201d\u201cThen aren\u2019t you going in?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Who?\u201d\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cWhy would I go in?\u201d\u201cThe bedroom is over there.\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed to the bedroom.\u00a0Inseop looked at his face as if he did not understand, then said, \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep here,\u201d and pointed to the sofa.\u201cYou think I trust you to let you sleep on the sofa?\u00a0You could rob the safe and run away.\u00a0You can\u2019t run away, so I have to hug you tight and sleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dSeeing the blood draining from Inseop\u2019s face, Lee Wooyeon smiled briefly and added, \u201cI\u2019m joking.\u201d\u201cStill, sleep inside the bedroom.\u00a0Where I can see you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0all right.\u201dEven if he said no, it would be a waste of energy.\u00a0Inseop accepted Lee Wooyeon\u2019s order.\u00a0After drinking the wine, he went to the bedroom and put a pillow below the bed.Lee Wooyeon came in and saw Inseop lying on the floor, and tapped his back with his feet.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cTurn your head to the other side.\u00a0So I can see your face.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Okay.\u201dInseop moved the pillow so that he was facing the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took off the clothes he was wearing and put them on the bedside.\u00a0Inseop, who remembered his habit of sleeping with all his clothes off, hurriedly pulled the blanket and covered his face.\u201cDon\u2019\u2019 you have to look at it without covering your eyes?\u201d\u201c\u2026Good night.\u201dInseop turned his back to the other side and answered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s soft laughter was heard on the bed.\u00a0The lights in the bedroom went out and silence fell over the two of them.\u00a0There was only the sound of breathing in the dark room.Inseop tossed and turned several times, thinking about the future.\u00a0Can he get out of here, let alone take revenge?\u00a0He\u2019ll have to call his parents in America tomorrow.\u00a0Does he have to do what happened during the day again?\u00a0Does it mean that Lee Wooyeon will believe what he says only by doing such things?\u00a0If he does it again, he thinks his heart will burst.\u00a0\u2018Ha\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Jenny, why did we fall for a man like this?\u00a0I miss Will.\u00a0Mom\u2026\u00a0What about Kate that I left on the roof?\u00a0She needs water\u2026\u00a0mom\u2026I want to run away.\u2019The haphazard thoughts continued to eat away his heart, gradually leaving him, and the sound of Inseop\u2019s breathing dispersed evenly.Lee Wooyeon, who was lying on the bed and looking down at Inseop, put his head on the pillow only after confirming that he was completely asleep.A long day was coming to an end.\u201cOh.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201dManager Cha, who saw Inseop at the office, greeted him warmly.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cLong time no see.\u00a0Did you have breakfast?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I have eaten.\u201d\u201cDid you have dinner last night?\u201d\u201cI ate.\u201d\u201cDid you have lunch yesterday?\u00a0Yesterday morning\u2026\u00a0are you eating well?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Thank you for your concern.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201dManager Cha patted Inseop on the shoulder.\u00a0Inseop, knowing what the meaning of his hand was, bowed his head silently.\u00a0They assumed that they both knew Lee Wooyeon\u2019s true identity, but never said it.\u00a0In the silent encouragement they shared whenever they met, they simply praised each other for their hard work.\u201cDid you take all the herbal medicine I gave you last time?\u00a0Should I make you another one?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u00a0Thank you.\u201dAlthough he answered confidently, Inseop wanted to cry for the kindness of the manager who took care of him warmly.\u00a0Manager Cha looked at Inseop with affection.Obviously, he knows Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0It was clear that Choi Inseop knows that Lee Wooyeon is like a mongrel dog trash.\u00a0He and CEO Kim were bound by the company, so why was he doing this without running away? \u2026\u00a0\u00a0Maybe it was to catch his weakness.Manager Cha clicked his tongue and shook his head.\u00a0On the day Lee Wooyeon went out with a shovel telling him to apply for an embargo at the newspaper where Kim Haeshin was located, something must have happened between the two of them.\u00a0However, when asked about this, Lee Wooyeon, that son of a bitch, bastard, asshole said not to worry about it and Choi Inseop, who was kind, naive, and pitiful only kept his mouth shut with tears in his eyes.Something happened. He was sure something happened.Knowing that the reporter\u2019s voice and Choi Inseop\u2019s voice were similar, Lee Wooyeon went out wearing mourning clothes with the intention to kill a person, and appeared a few days later holding Inseop\u2019s hand.\u00a0With a face as white as a corpse, Manager Cha told Inseop, who was dragged by Lee Wooyeon, to run away, but it was already too late.Obviously something must have happened.Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t stand something that bothered him.\u00a0He had a violent and ferocious personality, and he cast away things, be it work or people who annoyed him so that he could work well.\u00a0According to his usual behavioral pattern, Choi Inseop would have been buried in the ground about ten times.\u00a0However,the fact that he lived like that and even returned to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager position, it was either that Choi Inseop was a human mole, that even if he was buried, he continued to break through the ground or Lee Wooyeon\u2019s personality had changed.\u201cWhere is Lee Wooyeon?\u201dCEO Kim, who was passing by, saw Inseop and asked.\u201cWaiting in the car.\u201d\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he come up?\u201d\u201cHe said he was reading the script.\u201d\u201cScript?\u00a0What script?\u00a0There are no dramas or movies for the time being.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0he just don\u2019t want to come up.\u201dWhen Manager Cha answered instead, CEO Kim let out a sigh as he passed by.\u00a0After checking Lee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule and meticulously checking the changes, Inseop greeted the people in the office one after another and left.\u201cLet\u2019s go out together.\u00a0I have business with the bank.\u201dManager Cha followed Inseop into the elevator.\u00a0There was a metallic sound as the elevator\u2019s conveyor belt moved.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dBefore arriving on the first floor, Manager Cha opened his mouth with difficulty.\u201cMaybe, Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, the elevator door opened and Lee Wooyeon appeared, standing tall in front of him.\u201cHello,\u00a0manager.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and greeted him.\u00a0Manager Cha, who knew his nature, knew exactly what that smile meant, so he hesitated for a moment and stepped back.\u201cIt\u2019s been quite awhile since Inseop went up, but he didn\u2019t come down and so I was about to go up.\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long.\u00a0He came down in less than 10 minutes\u2026\u201dManager Cha hurriedly shut his mouth.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was staring at him with a smile on his face.\u201cYou seem to be very busy with the listing issue.\u201d\u201cRight.\u00a0So what?\u201d\u201cThen keep working hard.\u201dLee Wooyeon gestured to Inseop to go.\u00a0Watching Inseop drooping his shoulders and following him, Manager Cha remembered the documentary about wife that was assaulted he watched yesterday, and his heart was heavy.\u201cOh right.\u201dLee Wooyeon thought of something and walked up to manager Cha.\u00a0He didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but he felt uneasy, so he looked up at him, asking what happened.\u201cManager.\u00a0Thank you for being nice to my manager, but you don\u2019t have to say useless things.\u201d\u201cWh, what nonsense did I say?\u201dHis heart was pounding, but Manager Cha put out his own for once.\u201cI still get angry when I think about the trouble I went through because of that asshole.\u00a0I have no intention of letting Choi Inseop go for a while, so I told him not to cheat on me.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his teeth and spoke, one syllable at a time.\u00a0The momentum was so brutal that Manager Cha had no choice but to swallow his breath and nod his head.After hearing the desired answer, Lee Wooyeon waved his hand and disappeared.It was as Manager Cha expected.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s personality wouldn\u2019t change even if the world changed ten times, so it was clear that Choi Inseop was a human mole.\u00a0The next time he gets buried, he hoped in vain that he would dig a hole in the other side of the world and run far away without being caught by Lee Wooyeon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Doing such thingsInseop muttered bitterly inwardly and looked at the glass of the car with raindrops pouring down.When they got to the studio and stopped the car, it was raining more heavily than before.\u00a0As he recalled, there was no underground parking lot here.\u00a0As soon as Inseop turned off the engine, he grabbed an umbrella and ran out and put the umbrella on Lee Wooyeon.\u201cHurry in.\u201dSeeing Inseop say that with a very serious face even though he was working as a manager after being threatened, Lee Wooyeon burst into laughter.\u00a0He grabbed Inseop\u2019s shoulder and started running towards the entrance of the studio.Today was the day of a photo shoot in the studio, so he saw a few diehard fans waiting for Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Inseop did his best to secure a space so that Lee Wooyeon could pass through the gap between the squeaking women.As soon as he went inside, Inseop breathed a sigh of relief and wiped the rain off his clothes.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon went inside to check his clothes.\u201cAre you here?\u201dPhotographer Yoo Ohjin, who recognized Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, greeted him.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s raining a lot. It\u2019s pouring all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a coffee machine over there, so have a cup of coffee.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dA smile was drawn on Yoo Ohjin\u2019s lips as Inseop bowed his head politely to thank him.\u00a0After a while, Lee Wooyeon came out wearing the prepared clothes and finished makeup.Choi Inseop sat in a corner and watched him film.\u00a0If anyone around him needed a hand while filming, he ran to help without hesitation.\u00a0When the filming was finished in two hours and the director said, \u201cYou did a great job,\u201d Lee Wooyeon thanked them with a smile first.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI am grateful.\u00a0I think this photo will be great.\u00a0I\u2019m going to sell some magazines.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because photographer Yoo took good pictures.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I like the model.\u201dWhile Lee Wooyeon was removing his makeup, Choi Inseop was walking around, handing drinks to the staff one by one and saying goodbye.\u00a0Yoo Ohjin, who saw it, hinted a smile and looked at Inseop.\u201cWhy are you looking?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked the meaning of the gaze.\u201cHe\u2019s cute.\u00a0He looks like he\u2019s not very fussy, but if you look closely, he\u2019s working really hard.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s sincere.\u201dHe was so sincere that he started his work again with threats, but somehow it seemed like he was working harder than before.\u201cDoes Inseop perhaps play for my team?\u201dYoo Ohjin secretly winked.\u00a0He was a gay man and everyone on the floor knew.Lee Wooyeon smiled and said he probably was not.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cNo, I just wanted to stand out.\u00a0Because that kind of thing makes me a little hot.\u00a0He looks normal, but if you look closely, you\u2019ll notice it. He must have been the type of person who would have been bullied by bad guys when he was in school.\u00a0Hahaha.\u201dChoi Inseop, who finished his drink, was approaching them.\u201cThank you for your hard work\u201dInseop greeted Yoo Ohjin by handing him a drink.\u201cThank you.\u00a0Inseop, aren\u2019t you interested in things like photography?\u201d\u201cPhotogrphy?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you thinking of modeling?\u00a0I think it will turn out well.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0No, I would never do that.\u201dChoi Inseop frowned and shook his head.\u00a0However, Yoo Ohjin encouraged him to try modeling again.\u201cI think it will come out well because you have a small face and long limbs.\u00a0The freckled on your face are cute too.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I am not interested.\u201d\u201cReally?\u00a0I;m sorry.\u00a0If you are interested in the future, please come to the studio anytime.\u00a0I\u2019ll take a picture for you for free.\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201dChoi Inseop did not know that photographers take pictures of people they like when they flirt with them.\u00a0A bastard who has never experienced dating and never masturbated would not be able to recognize such a nuance.\u00a0And Lee Wooyeon knew that fact better than anyone.Still, he felt displeased and annoyed by the situation itself.\u201cWe\u2019re late.\u201d\u201cYes?\u00a0Ah yes.\u00a0Okay.\u201dHe knew there wasn\u2019t anything left on the schedule, but Inseop answered that way.\u201cI will prepare an umbrella.\u201dYoo Ohjin looked at Inseop\u2019s back as he ran to get an umbrella.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said goodbye and left the studio.\u00a0At the entrance, fans still waiting for Lee Wooyeon had gathered in groups of three or five.\u201cOppa, can you take a picture with me?\u201d\u201cWooyeon oppa.\u00a0Please look here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s raining, so hurry up and go in. You\u2019ll catch a cold..\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon said that in a friendly voice, screams erupted from among the waiting women.\u00a0Inseop was waiting for Lee Wooyeon with an umbrella open at the entrance.The moment Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes met Inseop, who was staring at him with big, frightened eyes, one shoulder wet, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s anger, that had barely been suppressed, soared.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHe grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm.\u00a0Then he took the umbrella that was in Inseop\u2019s hand.\u201cUh, I\u2019m holdi\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up and go.\u201dLee Wooyeon whispered softly and grabbed Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0Fans flocked to see Lee Wooyeon around him and blocked the road.\u201cOppa!\u00a0Say anything, your movie name, please say something just once.\u201d\u201cWooyeon brother.\u00a0Please take this.\u201d\u201cOppa, look here for a second!\u201dThe demands were also varied.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon and Inseop took an umbrella and started running towards the van.\u00a0Fans in raincoats also ran after them.\u00a0A fan, anxious to catch Lee Wooyeon, who was striding along, reached out and grabbed Inseop\u2019s hem.\u00a0As Inseop shuddered and fell backwards, Lee Wooyeon reflexively hugged Inseop\u2019s waist.\u00a0The scent of a body soaked in rain suddenly wafted from Inseop\u2019s body.From the barely touched face, Lee Wooyeon noticed that Inseop was scared of him, not the woman who pulled him.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201dChoi Inseop straightened his body and moved away from Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Even though his shoulders outside the umbrella were all wet in the rain, he didn\u2019t think of approaching Lee Wooyeon.Early spring rain poured down on the umbrella.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who looked down at Choi Inseop for a moment, went into the van.\u00a0Inseop covered himself with his hand and quickly got into the driver\u2019s seat.All the way home, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t say a word to Inseop.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have some business to attend to.\u201dWondering if he had misunderstood his words, Inseop turned off the engine and sat in the driver\u2019s seat for a while.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Do you want to follow me?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u00a0Can I be alone?\u201dFrom that day on, Lee Wooyeon always accompanied Inseop, not only on the schedule, but also on small chores.\u00a0It was because of the claim that he did not know what would happen if he kept him out of sight.\u201cGo and wait at the house quietly.\u00a0You know best that it is better not to think useless thoughts.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u00a0all right.\u201dLee Wooyeon got out of the car first, changed to his own car and left the parking lot.\u00a0As Inseop got out of the driver\u2019s seat, he stared blankly at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s car, which was moving away.As he climbed up to the 49th floor by himself in the elevator, Choi Inseop wondered if this might be a great opportunity.\u00a0However, when he remembered what would happen to the innocent Choi Inseop after he disappeared, he couldn\u2019t stop walking.\u00a0Most of all, he was trapped and he couldn\u2019t leave for the United States right away because his ID and passport were all in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s safe.\u201c\u2026 I will be caught.\u201dEven if he calmly closed his eyes and ran away, there was no guarantee that Lee Wooyeon would not find him.\u00a0If he came to his hiding place looking like he did that day, Inseop thought that his heart function, which had barely returned to normal, would stop that night.As Lee Wooyeon taught him, he entered the house after entering the password, and Inseop smiled bitterly as he recalled the ability of humans to adapt.It was not Stockholm Syndrome, but what should he call this because he came to seek revenge.\u00a0It should be reported as a new theory in academia.Inseop took off his shoes and went into the house.\u00a0He always came in with Lee Wooyeon, but coming in alone made the house feel even bigger.This place was always in a neat condition because a cleaning person came every few days to clean up the house.\u00a0Inseop, who was still looking for something to clean up, folded the newspaper on the table and arranged the cushions on the sofa.When he got out of the shower, he noticed a few more things to organize, so he went back and forth in the living room.\u00a0After all that was done, Inseop quickly became relaxed.\u00a0Previously, he would have spent time organizing and taking notes about Lee Wooyeon, but now he doesn\u2019t have to.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe didn\u2019t know how long it had been since he had time to kill. Inseop felt like he was alone with the sudden freedom that he received.He turned on the TV and changed the channels, but there was no program on that he was currently watching, so he quickly lost interest.\u00a0He was standing in front of the bookshelf thinking about reading a book, but he didn\u2019t want to touch someone else\u2019s book, which was not his, or someone else\u2019s book, even though there was no owner.Standing in front of the safe, Inseop gently grabbed the handle and shook it.\u201cIt can\u2019t be opened\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon took his cell phone and returned it only when making a business call or calling home once every three days.\u00a0In fact, even if he had a cell phone, there was no one to contact.\u00a0He had no friends or close friends in Korea.\u00a0He had nowhere else to go.It would not be an exaggeration to say that his life in Korea was solely for Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know if this was a good thing or a bad thing, but in the end, when he looked around, only Lee Wooyeon was left.Choi Inseop looked at his watch.\u00a0He was surprised to find out that less than an hour had passed since he had come home.\u00a0Has an hour been this long?\u201cWhen are you coming\u2026\u201dEven after speaking, Inseop covered his mouth with his palm and was startled.\u00a0It was as if he was waiting for Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He was glad no one was listening.His face burned hot as if he had discovered the truth he was holding inside.\u00a0Inseop slapped his cheek with the palm of his hand.\u201cWake up.\u00a0Choi Inseop.\u201dHe was like this because Lee Wooyeon was treating him a bit better.\u00a0No.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was a bad guy.\u00a0Very bad guy\u00a0No, he was a strange person and no words can fully expressed him.\u2026but he was good to him.Except for the occasional times when Lee Wooyeon spoke mean words or showed a dirty personality, he was much better than before.\u00a0They were so small that it wouldn\u2019t be noticed if one didn\u2019t pay attention to them, but he treated him kindly.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even make Inseop lift heavy things.\u00a0He also informed the office to adjust the schedule so that all schedules could be completed before 12 noon.\u00a0Of course, it was possible because there were no dramas or movies being filmed, but these days, everyday life was more comfortable for Inseop, who always saw the morning moon and went to work looking at the morning stars.\u00a0While waiting for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s filming, he often skipped meals, but these days, that is rarely the case.\u00a0There was always a break in time for meals.\u00a0Occasionally, on days when there was no schedule, he prepared breakfast for him.\u00a0He bought him anything he needed.\u00a0All the clothes and shoes he was wearing now were bought by Lee Wooyeon at the department store.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was so kind to Inseop that he wondered if it was okay to live such a luxurious life.\u00a0Today, when he was using an umbrella, he even wrapped his arms around his shoulders and hugged him.Inseop patted his shoulder alone and sighed.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It would be better if he didn\u2019t make fun of him.Inseop shook his head and stood up from his seat.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know when Lee Wooyeon would come back, but he stood in the kitchen thinking that they would have dinner together.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t very good at cooking, but he simply prepared a salad and made pasta sauce.\u00a0He was thinking of boiling the noodles when Lee Wooyeon arrived.After setting the table in the kitchen, Inseop checked the clock again.\u00a0He ate the salad alone and waited for Lee Wooyeon to come.Then he heard the door open.\u00a0Inseop jumped up from his seat and ran to the front door.\u201cYou came\u2026\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201dLee Wooyeon was back.\u00a0And next to him was a woman in bright clothes.Baek Heejin.\u00a0She was an actress who had a scandal with Lee Wooyeon before, and also an actress Inseop knew.\u201cHe\u2019s my manager.\u201dLee Wooyeon answered and went inside.\u201cI\u2019m here to change clothes.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u00a0\u201dWhile Lee Wooyeon entered the dressing room, Baek Heejin took off her shoes and went inside and started looking around.\u201cMr. Wooyeon, the house is very neat.\u00a0Anyone who sees it will know that you are living with a woman.\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s because there is someone else who cleans it up.\u201d\u201cIs the manager cleaning it too?\u201dShe turned her gaze to Inseop and asked.\u201cNo, I\u2019m just tidying up, a little\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0Do you two live together?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just for a while for some reason.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why he asked to meet outside.\u201dHearing Baek Heejin talking to herself, Inseop just lowered his head.\u00a0She let out some words of admiration as she looked at the bookshelf covering the wall in the living room.\u201cLee Wooyeon seems to really like books.\u00a0Oh, I know this author too.\u00a0This book is interesting.\u201dThe book she chose was the one that Lee Wooyeon had thrown away without even reading a few pages.\u00a0Inseop was about to say that, but he just kept his mouth shut.Lee Wooyeon, wearing a light blue shirt, with a tie around his neck, and buttoning up a button, smiled brightly at the book Baek Heejin was holding.\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting book.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I enjoyed it so much that I read it all in one sitting.\u00a0I don;t usually read books.\u00a0It seems to suit your taste.\u201d\u201cI know, right.\u201dLee Wooyeon answered by buttoning the sleeves of his shirt.\u00a0Inseop stood still and did not raise his head like a guilty person, only fiddling with the hem of his clothes.\u201cIf there is a book I want to read later, can I come and borrow it?\u201d\u201cPlease do.\u201dAlthough he gladly replied, he was never serious and had never met the same woman more than once.\u00a0While Baek Heejin was looking around the bookshelf and making a list of what books to borrow next time, Lee Wooyeon turned to Inseop.\u201cDid you eat?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I was about to now\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon glanced at the table top.\u201cAre you going to eat it all by yourself?\u201dHe asks, knowing that the food on the table was for two people.\u00a0Inseop only nodded his head slightly.\u201cIf you eat too much, you won\u2019t be able to sleep because of indigestion.\u00a0Eat in moderation.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and said.\u201cLet\u2019s get out quickly.\u201dBaek Heejin put her arm around Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm and said in a charming way.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon told Choi Inseop to look after the house and left through the front door.Hearing the two voices moving away from the front door, Inseop smiled bitterly.Again.It was like this every time.\u00a0If Lee Wooyeon does a little bit well, he gets excited by himself without knowing the anything\u2026\u00a0that in the end it will be like this.Inseop sat at the table alone and ate all the leftover salad.\u00a0He tried to boil the pasta noodles, but he lost his appetite and threw away all the sauce.\u00a0While cleaning the table, Inseop noticed that he was crying.\u201cI\u2019m sick of it, really\u2026\u201dIf trained repeatedly, dogs and monkeys also learn, but even though he was a human, he was disappointed and frustrated at the same thing every time.\u00a0Choi Inseop went into the room Lee Wooyeon had given him to use.\u00a0With the sheet over his head, he laid down on the floor.Should he run away like this?\u00a0Can\u2019t he live selfishly?\u00a0Can\u2019t he just do what he wants to do and live his life?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0there will be no one.\u00a0He can\u2019t run away alone at this point when he has already brought other people into this problem.He hated it though.\u00a0Anyway, Lee Wooyeon won\u2019t even believe him, and he\u2019ll do what he likes and obviously later\u2026\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026\u201d\u201cI left something behind and came back from the car.\u00a0Did you not hear me calling?\u201dThe door was closed and the sheets were rolled over, so he didn\u2019t hear the sound of him coming in.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked at Inseop, who was drenched in sweat and tears, as if it was funny.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIs it because I\u2019m with a girl?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s just that I\u2019m crying.\u201dNo matter how hard he tries to pretend it was nothing, it was obvious.\u00a0Inseop pulled the sheet Lee Wooyeon was holding.\u201cDon\u2019t mind me.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed softly at the added words.\u00a0At the sound of that laughter, Inseop felt his chest tighten.\u00a0No matter what he does, in the end, Lee Wooyeon only saw all of this as a joke.Saying bad things, being kind, or asking for strange things was just a thoughtless act.\u00a0Just like the kindness that Philip gshowed ave to Peter that he will never remember, nothing.\u201cIt bothers me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cBecause it bothers me, I take the girl to the hotel.\u00a0I don\u2019t go to the hotel very often because of the reporters.\u00a0I told her to wait downstairs, but the woman followed.\u00a0You must have foolishly thought I brought her here for you to see.\u201dChoi Inseop had no intention of ridiculing her.\u00a0They were all the same idiots, both him and the woman.\u201cI understand.\u201dInseop deliberately answered firmly and hid himself in the sheet again.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled open the sheet.\u201c\u2026Why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m different from Mr. Inseop, so if I don\u2019t do it for a long time, my stomach hurts.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI have to release it.\u00a0Not with your hands or your mouth, it\u2019s about putting it in a hole properly and wrapping it.\u201dInseop was still not used to seeing Lee Wooyeon making such a gentle and kind face and saying such vulgar things.\u00a0It felt like he was watching a scene from a bizarre movie where only the words were covered by the voice actors dubbing it.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to have sex.\u00a0Still, I thought I\u2019ll do it outside because Inseop is here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, good luck.\u201dWhy the hell was this guy telling him he\u2019s going to have sex?\u00a0You can do it without having to tell him.Inseop tried to pull the sheet out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon did not loosen the strength in the hand holding the sheet.\u201cIs Inseop crying because of me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I was just crying.\u201d\u201cIt felt good.\u00a0You heard the doorbell and came running.\u00a0To the front door like a dog.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cYou prepared food and waited, but then I went out with another woman, so did you cry?\u201dLee Wooyeon gently clicked his tongue and wiped the tears from Inseop\u2019s face.\u00a0The hand that wiped his face was very kind, but Inseop vowed not to be shaken.\u201cThat\u2019s not why I cried.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of me.\u00a0You\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll have sex with a woman.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0no.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Inseop, don\u2019t you like me?\u00a0You like me, so you\u2019re doing this shit right now.\u201d\u201cGo away.\u00a0She is waiting.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop;s arm as he was about to lie down again.\u201cDon\u2019t act like an adult. Tell me honestly that you cry like a child because you want to have sex with me.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u00a0! It\u2019s not like that.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know where and how such a conclusion came from, but Inseop blushed in embarrassment.\u00a0His voice trembled.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u00a0No, just\u00a0\u2026\u00a0go.\u201dHe wanted to lie on the floor and go to sleep, but Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm and wouldn\u2019t let him go.\u201cThen why are you crying?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThe expression on Inseop\u2019s face that he saw before closing the door and leaving hit Lee Wooyeon\u2019s nerves and it bothered him.\u00a0The voice of the woman next to him chattering was so loud but he couldn\u2019t even hear it.\u00a0He eventually said he had something he had left behind and turned around.He couldn\u2019t see Inseop, so when he entered the room, he saw that he was lying on the floor with a sheet covering him.The moment he saw Inseop\u2019s face blushing and holding back tears, Lee Wooyeon pulled him down.\u00a0It was the feeling he felt all the way home today in the car.To get rid of this heavy feeling, he had to put it in a hole properly and have sex.\u00a0It was quite tempting to use Choi Inseop;s mouth or hand to release his desires, but it was not completely resolved to that extent.\u00a0It felt lacking.So he contacted the woman.\u00a0Because he needed a hole for sex.But when he saw Choi Inseop with a sheet on and crying all by himself, he didn\u2019t like it very much.Lee Wooyeon, who had been contemplating for a moment with a frown on his forehead, asked with a gentle tone, as if he had made a decision.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Then would you like to have sex with me?\u201dChoi Inseop looked up blankly at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Occasionally he said things he didn\u2019t understand, but never as confusing as now.Lee Wooyeon asked in a serious voice without a smile.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u00a0I asked if you would like to have sex with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0What?\u201dLee Wooyeon forced Inseop to stand up.\u00a0Then he reached out and touched Inseop\u2019s buttocks.:\u201dI\u2019m asking if you want my cock in Choi Inseop\u2019s ass, now.\u201dThere were no other words that could explain it more easily.\u00a0Still, Inseop could not accept Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, so his eyes widened and he looked as if he had been hit hard in the back of the head.No matter what he said, Inseop seemed unable to accept the situation.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon made a sullen impression and tapped Inseop\u2019s cheek with his finger.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Then just say this.\u00a0Do you want me to bring her up here in front of you and take her to bed in my room?\u201dHis lower half was even heavier than before.\u00a0He didn\u2019t feel like going to the hotel and sleeping with her.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s chin and pushed him fiercely.\u201cDo you want to see me sleeping with her in front of you?\u00a0Just say no, I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d\u201c\u2026no\u2026\u201dInseop shook his head blankly.It wasn\u2019t what he wanted.\u00a0No, he didn\u2019t like it.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t like he was struggling here to see that kind of thing.\u201cOkay, then.\u201dLee Wooyeon pulled out his cell phone from his pocket and called the woman who was waiting in the car.\u00a0He said he had to go right now because something very urgent happened, and he hung up the phone without adding a single word of apology.Lee Wooyeon threw the phone away and dragged Inseop\u2019s arm out of the room.\u201cWhat are you doing\u2026\u201d\u201cObviously it was Inseop\u2019s choice.\u00a0I need a hole to put it in now, and Mr. Inseop has to provide it.\u201d\u201cWhy me,\u00a0no\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe was thrown into the bed.\u00a0Seeing Lee Wooyeon taking off his clothes, who closed the door, Inseop got up.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cObv, obviously\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.\u00a0He had a face that said he didn\u2019t really understand.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like it?\u00a0Inseop likes me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon continued the conversation as he unbuttoned his shirt one by one.\u201cYou don\u2019t like me having sex with other women, nor with you.\u00a0Where do you find such selfish words?\u201d\u201cLee, Lee Wooyeon, you don\u2019t want to do it with me!\u201dInseop desperately tried to find a reason to stop Lee Wooyeon.\u201cLee Wooyeon, that is, it\u2019s not something you want to do with me.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon was a straight guy who liked women.\u00a0What had happened before was like a cruel prank to inflict shame on him.\u00a0But this could not be dismissed as a joke.\u201cIf I want to do it with Inseop, does that mean I can do it?\u201d\u201cI mean\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon nodded.\u201cI want to do it.\u00a0With Inseop.\u201d\u201cAh, don\u2019t lie\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon covered Inseop\u2019s mouth with his palm.\u201cShut up and listen to what people say.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI want to.\u00a0I want to put my dick in your hole.\u00a0Is this what you wanted to hear?\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s shoulder and took off the T-shirt he was wearing.\u00a0Inseop struggled to get out of his hand, but he was soon overpowered and put on the bed.Lee Wooyeon pressed Inseop\u2019s arm with his knee, unbuttoned the shirt, and threw it off.\u00a0He looked down at Inseop with cold eyes.\u00a0Inseop, who read the man\u2019s desires wriggling in his cool gaze, struggled.\u201cI don\u2019t, I don\u2019t.\u00a0So\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to do it.\u00a0Now.\u201dHe thought he won\u2019t be able to get hard for a man, but that thought was wrong.\u00a0Seeing Inseop crying on the floor, blood rushed to the bottom and he did not have any problems with his dick getting hard.\u201cInseop likes me.\u00a0Right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dBehind the cliff was a hungry tiger..\u00a0Choi Inseop could neither shake his head nor say no, so he bit his lip in frustration.\u201cYou\u2019re doing it with someone you like, but why do you hate it so much?\u201dLee Wooyeon slowly reached out to Inseop\u2019s pants buckle and whispered.\u201cEven then, you suck my dick like it\u2019s delicious, so don\u2019t pretend that you don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon led Inseop\u2019s hand between his legs.\u201cTouch me.\u201d\u201c\u2026hate\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say no, I\u2019ll tear your mouth apart.\u201dWhen Inseop was frightened and took a breath, Lee Wooyeon laughed.\u201cJust a joke.\u00a0But don\u2019t really say you don\u2019t like it.\u00a0Because I don\u2019t have a hobby of violating men by force.\u201dLee Wooyeon took off his pants and threw them under the bed.\u00a0The tip of his dick was already wet with precum.\u201cYou\u2019ve done it before, so you can do better.\u201dInseop tried to pull his hand back, but Lee Wooyeon was faster.\u00a0He clasped Inseop\u2019s hand between his fingers and made him tuck it into his underwear.\u201cTouch it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe made an expression like something disgusting had touched his hand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled softly and broke Inseop\u2019s wrist.\u201cAHH\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou have to pay the price for making me come back when I was about to have an affair with a woman who was willing to spread her legs.\u00a0Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cUgh, it hurts\u2026\u201d\u201cSo do it right.\u201dLee Wooyeon released Inseop\u2019s hand.\u00a0Inseop bowed his head down from the pain of his twisted wrist and swallowed a moan.\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to play around right now.\u00a0I want to put it in right away, but it\u2019s Inseop\u2019s first time, so I\u2019m being patient.\u201dLee Wooyeon ruffled Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0Then he bent down and kissed his earlobe.\u00a0Inseop was startled and covered the area where Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips touched with his palm.\u00a0His face turned red and he wanted to ask if he was breathing properly.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Do you like this?\u00a0Do you, Inseop?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, I\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon removed Inseop\u2019s hand and pressed his lips to the area where he had kissed earlier.\u00a0Inseop wriggled to escape, but Lee Wooyeon gently kissed the edge of the ear several times more.Inseop was in tears.\u00a0He stubbornly refused, saying he didn\u2019t like it, and his whole body turned red after he kissed him in the ear a few times.\u201cWhy are you crying again?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s pathetic.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and pressed Inseop\u2019s eye area with his finger.\u201cAre you more pathetic than me, who left the woman in the car ready to sleep with me from head to toe?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s have a good time, two\u00a0 pathetic people together.\u201dLee Wooyeon put his lips close to Inseop\u2019s ear and whispered.\u00a0It was pretty cute to see Inseop not knowing what to do whenever his lips brushed, and Lee Wooyeon kissed it a few more times.This was pretty goodLee Wooyeon laughed and took off Inseop\u2019s pants.\u00a0Inseop weakly resisted, but each time, Lee Wooyeon kissed Inseop\u2019s ear.With a piece of underwear between them, their bodies touched.Lee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s back with his palm.\u00a0The bones of the spine touched the tip of his finger.\u00a0Too skinny.\u00a0Such a skinny body was not to his liking.\u00a0He liked the sensual body shape that was soft to the touch when held.\u00a0Even so, the skin was soft and it had a pleasant feeling in the palm of his hand.Lee Wooyeon ran his hand in front of Inseop.\u00a0The hand that had been stroking his flat chest stopped at the long, vertical surgical scar on the left.\u00a0Inseop was also bewildered by what he noticed, so he covered his chest with a sheet.\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDid you have any pain during the operation?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t know because I was anesthetized.\u201dWhen an unfamiliar answer came back, Lee Wooyeon burst into laughter.\u00a0However, Inseop was still clutching the sheet with a frightened face.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0I\u2019m trying to do well.\u00a0So Inseop, try your best.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dWhen he turned his head and their eyes met, Inseop regretted that he lifted his face.\u00a0What a beautiful face.\u00a0It was a pitiful and beautiful face that made his heart flutter even when their eyes met.As Inseop was looking up at him blankly, Lee Wooyeon smiled and asks.\u201cIt it good?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cYou love me so much that you stare at me in awe.\u00a0Then you\u2019d better do it with me.\u201dLee Wooyeon brought Inseop\u2019s hand to his groin again.\u201cTouch it.\u00a0Like last time, you know right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just like last time\u2026 can I do it?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u00a0If you do well like last time, I\u2019ll just finish it like that.\u201d\u201cAll right\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop swallowed slowly.\u00a0Just like last time, he will be able to finish it somehow.\u00a0He moved his fingers and grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s dick and shook it.\u201cNot like that. Think of it as grabbing your skin a little bit. Yes. Like that.\u201dLee Wooyeon corrected Inseop\u2019s hand posture and movement.\u00a0Inseop laid down, desperately turning his head to the side so as not to make eye contact, holding Lee Wooyeon\u2019s and moving his hand.\u00a0Soon his palms were sticky and wet.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t hold all with one hand, which started to swell, so it slipped out of his hand several times.\u201cTsk.\u201dLee Wooyeon raised his waist and frowned.\u201cAre you doing this on purpose because you want to do it with your mouth?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s too big\u2026keeps slipping out of my hand\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re begging me to put it in your mouth like that.\u201dLee Wooyeon moved and put his groin in front of Inseop\u2019s face.\u201cSuck it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201cYou seduced me now because you wanted to suck.\u00a0I\u2019ll let you suck, so you can suck as much as you want.\u201dLee Wooyeon put his hand inside Inseop\u2019s mouth, opened it, and made him take the end of his dick to suck.\u201cClose your lips.\u00a0Ah\u2026okay.\u201dAs he pushed into his moist mouth, Lee Wooyeon moaned in a low voice.\u00a0Inseop tried to open his mouth as much as possible, but it was not enough to put it all in his mouth.As Inseop kept coughing and panting for breath, Lee Wooyeon pulled him back.\u201cLie down.\u00a0It will be better if you lie down and suck.\u201dHe made Inseop lie down and pulled his hair as if clutching it.\u00a0Watching Inseop\u2019s small face move carefully between his legs, Lee Wooyeon licked his dry lips with his tongue.\u201cIs it very tasty\u2026\u00a0You\u2019re doing well.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201dInseop wanted to rest for a while because of the large dick that stabbed in his mouth, but Lee Wooyeon did not let him go.\u201cDon\u2019t rest.\u00a0Lick it with your tongue.\u00a0It\u2019s a dick you\u2019ve been wanting to eat.\u201dIt was too hard.\u00a0His mouth was numb and tears were pouring down his cheeks.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who watched Choi Inseop moving with tears in his eyes while sucking him, muttered a low swear word.He was so turned on that he couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.\u201c\u2026ha.\u00a0Fuck, really.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop and raised him up.\u00a0Inseop wiped his lips with the back of his hand, wondering if he had made another mistake, and looked at Lee Wooyeon with a blank look.\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cI was going to cum once, but let me just put it in and cum.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u00a0!\u201dBefore he even asked what he was going to put where, Lee Wooyeon turned Inseop\u2019s body and made him lie on the bed.\u00a0Inseop shuddered at the embarrassing posture with his hips raised and shivered.\u201cStay still.\u00a0I\u2019ll put it in now\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u00a0wait\u2026 Wait a minute\u2026 Ah, I don\u2019t\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI said that if Inseop did well, I might not put it in\u00a0 but I never said I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not fair\u2026\u00a0, ah, wait a minute.\u201dInseop reached out to push Lee Wooyeon\u2019s chest, but his hand was caught and held on top of his head.\u201cIf someone you like tells you they want to put it in, just spread your legs out.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed his waist to put the tip of his wet dick between Inseop\u2019s buttocks.\u00a0When Inseop was startled and tried to get up, Lee Wooyeon pressed his hand down on his head, making him immobile.\u201cStay still, stay\u2026 \u00a0Because I am putting it in.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0!\u2026\u00a0ahh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0wai\u2026\u201dHe felt a fireball in his body before his head could recognize what had happened.\u00a0A suppressed scream escaped Inseop\u2019s open mouth.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was pressing Inseop\u2019s head from behind and inserting it, spit out abusive language like he was angry.\u201cRelax.\u00a0Just a little bit more and it\u2019s all in.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Ah\u2026\u00a0hurts.\u201d\u201cEverything went in. Okay?\u00a0Relax.\u00a0Breathe out slowly.\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop\u2019s back and whispered to him.\u00a0As Inseop barely exhaled and relieved the tension from his body, Lee Wooyeon did not miss the gap and pushed his dick between the hole.\u201c\u2026\u00a0!\u00a0Ughh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop bit his lip again and shivered.\u201cRelax\u2026\u00a0Slowly, breathe.\u00a0Almost done.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026ugh, Mr. Lee Wooyeon, take it out\u2026 take it out\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI see.\u00a0I\u2019ll take it out.\u00a0I\u2019m going to take it out, so let your body relax a bit.\u201dLee Wooyeon comforted Inseop who was crying and rubbed his back.\u00a0If the sharp pain that dug through his legs was to disappear, Inseop was willing to do anything.\u00a0He exhaled slowly as Lee Wooyeon instructed, trying to relieve the tension in his body.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!Ugh\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed to the end.\u00a0He narrowed his eyes and exhaled a hot breath at the feeling of his dick inside the tight hole.\u201cFuck\u2026\u00a0It really is amazing.\u201d\u201cAh, it hurts\u2026\u00a0ugh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, take it out\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou want me to take this out?\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s buttocks with both hands and raised his waist.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s tears flowed down and he begged for it to be removed.\u201cIt hurts, ah\u2026, please, ah\u2026\u201d\u201cHow do I get this out?\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201dAs he spit out his question, Lee Wooyeon shook his waist.\u00a0While Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hard body collided with a popping sound, Inseop let out a weeping sound.\u201cAwesome, Fuck, Mr. Inseop\u2019s hole bites my cock so tightly and doesn\u2019t let go.\u201d\u201cAh!Ugh\u2026!\u00a0Ah, ha\u2026\u00a0!\u00a0Ah!\u201dWhenever Lee Wooyeon moved his waist, Inseop\u2019s body shook helplessly.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm and half-lifted his shoulder, then deepened the bond.\u00a0After pushing through the narrow gap to the end of the root, Lee Wooyeon sighed softly.\u201cInseop, it\u2019s really delicious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Ah\u2026\u00a0Haaa\u00a0\u2026\u00a0uh\u00a0Ah, ack!\u201d\u201cMr. Inseop\u2019s hole is so delicious.\u00a0Ah,\u2026\u00a0\u201dEvery time he moved his waist, Inseop squirmed and screamed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon liked it, so he moved even faster and harder than usual.\u00a0He was going to taste Inseop\u2019s hole slowly, but he couldn\u2019t afford to do that.\u201cNo\u2026\u00a0No, ah, take it out, take it out\u2026\u00a0, Ah\u2026please\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s good that I put it in.\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0The sheets were stained with tears.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon reached out and grabbed Inseop\u2019s legs.\u201cYou say it\u2019s painful, but your dick is hard.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u00a0no\u2026\u00a0.\u201dPutting Inseop;s genitals between his fingers and rubbing them up and down, Inseop\u2019s body quickly turned red.\u00a0The sound of breathing warmed up on the sheet.\u201cHaha, Mr. Inseop.\u00a0You\u2019re so lewd.\u00a0I touched your cock a few times and you clenched your hole around me.\u201dLee Wooyeon ran his hand over Inseop\u2019s and slammed into him.\u00a0Inseop groaned and endured the moan.\u00a0It was shameful that his body was changing strangely.\u201cWith such a lewd body \u2026\u00a0You\u2019ve never done it?\u201dLee Wooyeon moaned and bumped his thigh.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body fell on the sheet like it was collapsing.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u00a0 got on top of him and started moving.\u201cAh!\u00a0Aah!\u00a0Ugh\u00a0Ah!\u00a0Uh!\u00a0Ah, plea\u00a0\u2026\u00a0please\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u00a0Am I the first to put it in Mr. Inseop\u2019s hole?\u201dInseop barely nodded his head.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon continued with a satisfied smile.\u201cDid I takeChoi Inseop\u2019s virginity?\u201d\u201cAh, ha\u2026\u00a0Ah!\u00a0Uhhhhhh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cFuck, answer me with your mouth.\u00a0I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m the first to put it up your hole.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes, ah\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ah\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.heuk\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop\u2019s body from behind.\u00a0The sweet scent that was wafting out of him made him even harder.\u00a0He put his teeth on Inseop\u2019s shoulder and licked it with his tongue.\u00a0Watching the marks he made with his teeth, Lee Wooyeon smiled faintly.Inseop gradually became harder in the palm of his hand.\u00a0He had no intention of touching a man\u2019s cock, but seeing Inseop panting and exhaling hot breath, he thought that this was not bad either.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0uhh.\u201dLee Wooyeon moved his waist and let out a low moan.He heard that once you taste the taste of a man\u2019s hole, you can\u2019t get rid of it.\u201cDo you like it?\u00a0Mr. Inseop\u2026\u00a0Do you like it?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked, but Inseop did not give any answer because he was shaking like a beast, and he only moaned like an animal.\u201cChoi Inseop, are you okay?\u00a0You have to answer!\u00a0Because I, I, put it in your hole, you\u2019re going excited.\u201d\u201cAh, no\u2026 I\u2026\u00a0 Ah\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop was unable to accept this situation in his head.\u00a0Being suddenly caught and inserted by Lee Wooyeon was a shock that seemed to turn his world upside down, but even with the pain, he was panting as if he was out of breath.\u00a0No matter what he did, it was unacceptable.The man\u2019s hard dick penetrated to the inside of his stomach and stabbed him like he was hollow inside.\u00a0Inseop held Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm with his one uninjured hand and made an unknown plea.\u00a0\u2019Please, please, please\u2026 please, how, ah, I think I\u2019m going to die\u00a0\u2026 please\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u2019Lee Wooyeon, who had been moving his waist around like a horned beast, suddenly stopped moving while looking down at Inseop.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?!\u201dWhen the intense sensations that had been mixing in his body stopped, this time his head was spinning.\u00a0Inseop looked up at Lee Wooyeon with red swollen eyes and licked his lips.\u201cTell me you like it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou love it because I put it in, confess it.\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201dSaying that, Lee Wooyeon gently raised his waist.\u00a0A groan came out of Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u201cYou seduce me.\u00a0I like Lee Wooyeon, so I got down on my knees that day and hung on to him. Say it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why\u2026\u00a0 I\u2026.\u201d\u201cI want to hear it.\u00a0I want to hear Inseop say he likes me while my dick is in Mr. Inseop\u2019s hole. Okay?\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop and encouraged his confession.\u00a0Every time Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath touched his back, Inseop\u2019s body trembled.\u00a0Inseop said \u2018I, I,\u2019 and moved his lips a few times before shaking his head.Then, Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s dick and began to rub him.\u00a0Inseop shuddered as if he was about to run out of breath, and his back twitched.A little more, a little more, as if he was going to cum, Inseop opened his dry lips halfway and instinctively pursued the pleasure at the tingling sensation that was dripping from his toes.\u00a0However, when they reached the climax, Lee Wooyeon pressed the tip of his penis tightly with his fingertips.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please, hand\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cTell me you like me.\u00a0If you don\u2019t tell me, I\u2019ll never let you go.\u201dInseop was about to faint at the tingling sensation that was holding his breath.\u00a0He wanted to get rid of it quickly and then breathe freely, but Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t let him do that.\u201cWo, Wooyeon\u2026 hand\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you tell me, I will let you go.\u00a0Hurry up.\u201d\u201cLike, I\u2026\u00a0like\u2026\u00a0you\u2026\u00a0ha.\u201d\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d\u201cLee Woo\u2026\u00a0yeon\u2026\u00a0I like you\u2026\u00a0\u201dAs soon as he finished his confession, Lee Wooyeon said, well done, and patted Inseop\u2019s back.\u00a0Then, holding his genitals in his hands, he slammed his back hard.\u201cAck!\u00a0Ah!\u00a0\u00a0Ah!\u00a0Haa!!\u00a0Haa!!!!\u201dJust before ejaculating, when he was hit from behind while being blocked, Inseop screamed and squirmed.\u00a0Sweat was also forming on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead.\u201cOh, I\u2019ll cum for you.\u00a0There\u2019s a lot in Mr. Inseop\u2026\u00a0, fuck, ack.\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop\u2019s shoulder and pulled him up for an instant.\u00a0Thick semen poured hotly into the hole.\u00a0At the same time, hot semen poured out of Inseop\u2019s genitals, which he had released.As his senses reached its peak, Inseop just let go of his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The feeling of the person you like\u2019s cum coming out\u00a0 of your body.\u201dInseop couldn\u2019t really understand what kind of answer he wanted when asking such a vulgar question.\u00a0If

behind his back and babbling lewd words, and he couldn\u2019t get his mind to rest.\u201cTell me.\u00a0Fast.\u201dLee Wooyeon constantly wiggled his fingers inside him, urging him to answer.\u00a0He didn\u2019t pull out his finger, even though it seemed that nothing more would come out.\u201cWhere did you like it best?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u00a0Why are you asking such a thing\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cAnswer me.\u201dLee Wooyeon coldly demanded Inseop\u2019s answer.\u00a0Inseop wanted to cry.\u00a0What did he want from his answer?\u00a0Even if his mouth was torn apart, he couldn\u2019t say that he liked licking a man\u2019s thing with his mouth, and even if he dies, he can\u2019t say that it felt good to be treated like a woman with his legs wide open.But to say he didn\u2019t like any, he was so scared of Lee Wooyeon, who staring at him from behind.\u201cI, I\u2026 just\u2026\u00a0\u201dWhen his fingertips touched a certain part, Inseop\u2019s body moved as if it were bouncing upwards.\u201cWhat?\u00a0Are you sick?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cAre you sick here?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked, pressing down on the area he pressed earlier with his fingertips.\u00a0Inseop gasped and bit his lip.\u201cIt hurts a lot?\u00a0Does it hurt when I do this?\u201dWith his fingertips moving and touching the folds thoroughly, pretending not to know anything, Lee Wooyeon spoke words of concern into Inseop\u2019s ear.\u00a0Inseop leaned against the bathroom wall.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Are you okay?\u201d\u201c \u2026 finger\u2026\u00a0 take it out\u2026\u00a0ugh\u2026\u00a0\u201dGoosebumps ran down his spine at the vivid sensation of the fingers coming out of him.\u00a0While Inseop gasped and caught his breath, Lee Wooyeon narrowed his eyes and said,\u201cAre my fingers that tasty?\u00a0It\u2019s very tight down there and clenching down on my fingers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop was startled by the feeling of a hard dick between his buttocks and tried to turn around, but Lee Wooyeon grabbed his arm and pressed it against the bathroom wall.\u201cI don\u2019t think the insides are feeling full.\u00a0I saw it devouring my fingers very greedily.\u201d\u201cOh, no, no.\u201dThe tip of the blunt dick was rubbed between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said while biting Inseop\u2019s ear.\u201cEven if I don\u2019t have a conscience\u2026\u00a0It was your first time, so I was only going to do it once, but if Inseop wants that, there is nothing I can do but give you what you want.\u201d\u201cAh, don\u2019t\u2026\u00a0please\u2026\u00a0don\u2019t.\u201dChoi Inseop said while trembling.He was still barely standing still.\u00a0Without Lee Wooyeon\u2019s support, he probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to take a single step outside the bedroom.\u201cEven if you say that, you\u2019re rubbing your dick against the bathroom wall.\u201d\u201cThat was because Lee Wooyeon pushed me from behind\u2026\u00a0\u201dFrom behind, Lee Wooyeon was pushing Inseop with his body, so he had no choice but to stick to the bathroom wall.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon smiled, his white teeth showing, rubbing his body against Inseop.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while for me too, so I don\u2019t think I can do it just once.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0No, no\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cThe thing that touches Inseop\u2019s balls is my cock.\u00a0Touch it.\u201dLee Wooyeon made Inseop\u2019s one hand go down and put it between his legs.\u201cHow is it?\u00a0You touched it.\u201d\u201c\u2026ugh\u201dUnder the sensitively swollen Inseop, Lee Wooyeon rubbed his cock that had begun to shake and asked persistently.\u201cI\u2019m asking you how it is.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026\u00a0hard.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even know what he was talking about.\u00a0Inseop had no choice but to spit out the words that just popped into his head.\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hot and big\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cDo you want me to put this here?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked, stroking Inseop\u2019s hole with his fingers.Inseop shook his head.\u00a0It was no longer possible.\u00a0He felt like he was going to die if he did it one more time.\u201cSeeing you lie all the time, do you want to put it in your mouth and suck it?\u201dLee Wooyeon made Inseop kneel on the bathroom floor.\u201cSuck it.\u201dAt some point in time, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s genitals were so hard that the veins popped.\u00a0As if Inseop was begging, he looked into Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes and muttered, \u201cPlease.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been following me all this time because you want to suck this.\u00a0Come on, I\u2019ll make you suck.\u201dLee Wooyeon showed his obscene goodwill and shoved his own into Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u00a0The image of Inseop opening his mouth to swallow his genitals while crying, ignited Lee Wooyeon\u2019s desire.\u201cAre you doing this on purpose?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI wonder if you are deliberately trying to tease me so that I can put mine in your hole.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0No.\u201d\u201cDid someone tell you to take it out of your mouth?\u00a0Hurry up.\u201dChoi Inseop opened his mouth again and swallowed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s.\u00a0It was a feeling he couldn\u2019t get used to no matter how many times he did it.\u00a0A hard dick went in and out of his mouth.\u00a0As Lee Wooyeon said, it felt like his mouth was being violated.Lee Wooyeon, who was moving his back in front of Inseop\u2019s face, eventually made Inseop lie on the floor of the bathroom and got on top of him.\u201cOkay.\u00a0I\u2019ll give you whatever Inseop wants.\u201d\u201cI never wanted anything like that\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWith his legs wide open, Lee Wooyeon shoved his hot cock like a weapon into the exposed hole at once.\u00a0It was easier to get in and out than before since it had already been loosened once, but moving it wasn\u2019t as easy as he thought it would be.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon reached out and brought the shower head.\u00a0He put the shower set for hot water under Inseop and started shoveling.\u00a0Every time his genitals went in and out, water from the shower also went in.\u00a0A shriek echoed against the bathroom wall.\u00a0The water that had flowed into the hole between Inseop\u2019s legs leaked out.\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you squealing.\u201d\u201cAh, haa, \u2015\u2015Ah, please.\u2015\u2015.\u201dInseop sobbed and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u00a0He was short of breath, his head was dizzy, and he felt like he was going to die.\u201cAh!!\u00a0Uh-uh\u2013, ah!!\u00a0Ah, I , uh, ah, ah, now, wait\u2014\u2014, ah!\u201dHe wanted to stop the feeling that was flowing through his body, even for a brief moment.\u201cFuck, it\u2019s really tight\u2026ugh\u201d\u201cAh!\u00a0Woo woo\u2026 yeon\u2026\u00a0I\u2026\u00a0ah, ah ah!\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop by the shoulder and made him sit on his lap.\u00a0As he sat down, the bodies that were joined deepened.\u00a0Inseop, who had lost all the strength of his body, was hugged by Lee Wooyeon as he collapsed and shook him like a doll with a broken thread.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop\u2019s slender waist, which seemed like it would break with even a little force, and picked him up.\u201cAh, Inseop\u2019s hole is tightening like you\u2019re going to cut off my dick\u2026 ha.\u00a0I won\u2019t take it off.\u00a0You\u2019re tightening around me like this\u2014\u2014\u2014 I\u2019ll put it in for you.\u201d\u201cAh, uh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, uh, ah!\u00a0Ah, I, ooh, Lee Wooyeon\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cSo, do you want to eat it?\u00a0Come on, eat\u2026\u00a0ha.\u00a0I\u2019ll put it inside, so\u2013tighten it tightly and eat it.\u201dEvery time he shoved it in hard, Inseop sobbed and held on to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hated when women hugged him with their sweaty, sticky bodies while having sex.\u00a0At that time, he quietly lowered the woman\u2019s waist and pushed her from behind, making it difficult to hold him.But now, Choi Inseop was sobbing like a child and clinging to him, strangely, he didn\u2019t hate it.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s head with one hand, supported him so he wouldn\u2019t fall, and lifted his waist.\u201cDoes my cock taste better if you take it in from your ass?\u201d\u201cAh!\u00a0Ah!!\u00a0ha!Ugh!!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you everything, so eat it, haa, eat it all.Fuck, it feels so good.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0 I\u2019ll\u2026 die\u00a0\u2026\u00a0please\u2026\u00a0 ah, ugh.\u201dAs if saying that he was going to die was not a lie, Inseop\u2019s penis, which had been almost hard, was now dry and shrunken.\u00a0In a normal state, he would have even touched Inseop, but now he couldn\u2019t afford to do that.\u00a0With his mouth dry and his head pounding, Lee Wooyeon pounded himself into Inseop\u2019s body without stopping.Inseop\u2019s slender body trembled uncontrollably.\u00a0Not long after, Lee Wooyeon reached his climax.\u00a0A hot liquid shot into Inseop\u2019s ass.\u00a0Holding Inseop who was sobbing, Lee Wooyeon took a deep breath.Even though it was over, he didn\u2019t want to get out of Inseop\u2019s body, so he hugged Inseop for a long

I\u2019m\u00a0sorry.\u201dInseop slowly moved his body and laid on the other side of Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Even if that person spoke like that, in the end the conclusion was that he did whatever he liked.\u201cOh right.\u00a0This isn\u2019t your first time. right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cDid you say you tried it with a woman?\u00a0Kate, right?\u201d\u201cKa\u2026\u00a0te\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHis voice cracked and it was difficult to speak.\u00a0Still, wanting to clear out the huge misunderstanding this time, Inseop continued to speak in a hoarse voice.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It is a flower.\u00a0Mimosa\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cFlowers?\u00a0Are you talking about a plant?\u201dInseop nodded his head.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop\u2026\u00a0Do you get excited by plants?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a joke.\u00a0By the way, was Kate, whom Inseop often said to be with, a flower?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cGoing to water means really giving water.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice as he said that seemed somehow cheerful.\u00a0Choi Inseop did not answer and pulled the sheet up to cover his face.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled the sheet down.\u201cIt\u2019s getting hot.\u00a0Still, you have a fever.\u00a0It must have been a strain on your body when I took everything off in the bathroom.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI was trying to get the semen out of Inseop\u2019s hole, but I couldn\u2019t help it because Inseop was begging me to put it in.\u201dIf anyone heard it, they would think he must have been put in because he asked for it.\u00a0Choi Inseop felt like he was going to die due to injustice, but he was already in a very bad condition, so he passed out and slept and did nothing.\u201cYou can rest until tomorrow.\u00a0There is no schedule for tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI told them to put off my schedule.\u00a0Today was enough for me to go alone without a manager.\u201dOnly then did Inseop look at his watch.\u00a0The dim light coming through the curtain seemed to be the setting sun, not the rising sun.\u201cToday\u2013.\u201d\u201cIt went well, you know.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry.\u201dLee Wooyeon went around comfortably all day, making Manager Cha drive and chase after him while shouting \u201cLee Wooyeon, why me!\u201d.\u00a0He was the manager who was uselessly kind to Inseop these days.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dWhen Choi Inseop said that in a very subdued voice, Lee Wooyeon paused for a moment and burst into laughter.\u201c Ha ha ha ha ha.\u201dAs the sound of his laughter dispersed in the air, Inseop shrugged his shoulders and bowed his head.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Are you really sorry?\u00a0Or are you just saying that?\u00a0Either way, it\u2019s funny, hahahaha.\u00a0You\u2019re really amazing.\u201dLee Wooyeon continued with a smile, swiping his messy hair up with his hand.\u201cHas Choi Inseop been living in the world like that?\u00a0You can\u2019t stand it when you think that you\u2019ve caused harm to others.\u00a0Like an idiot.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLike a bastard till the end, he was digging into his heart, but his words were so sharp that Inseop could not be angry.\u00a0It was something he had always heard from his mother and father.\u00a0He was so considerate of others that it was useless. \u201cTake care of yourself a little more, Peter,\u201d his mother nagged.There was only one time when he thought his own heart was more important than that of others and acted arbitrarily.\u00a0As a result, it left a huge scar in his life, and Inseop became more concerned about harming others than before.\u00a0Enough for it to be called obsessive-compulsive.\u201cWell, I mean\u2026 that\u2019s enough. Anyway, there\u2019s nothing to be sorry about. Since all the schedules these days were all relaxed.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s hand patted Inseop\u2019s head as if patting it.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s heart sank.\u00a0Was the hand that pampered him in his sleep belong to Lee Wooyeon?\u00a0Was he the owner of the friendly hand that touched his forehead and brushed his hair away?Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand slowly glided down from his head to the nape of his neck, from his shoulder to his waist.\u00a0Then he paused between the buttocks, giving him a meaningful pat.\u201cGet well soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dIt was a dream.\u00a0The dream was clear.\u00a0If it was Lee Wooyeon, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to use such humane movements.\u201cI\u2019ll prepare a meal for you, so lie down.\u201d\u201cI am\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dLee Wooyeon made Inseop lie down again and left the bedroom.\u00a0Inseop, who buried his face in the pillow, lashed out at himself saying that he shouldn\u2019t be weakened by this.Lee Wooyeon was only good with words.\u00a0So he should be cold.\u00a0Don\u2019t give him a chance.\u00a0Calm down.However, the porridge brought by Lee Wooyeon was so delicious and sweet that Inseop emptied the bowl and fell into a deep sense of shame again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

drink.\u00a0Drink to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d\u201cCan I have more meat?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u00a0Today, the CEO is going to treat you, so eat as much as you want.\u201dAfter successfully listing and completing complicated tasks, CEO Kim Hakseung declared that he would give a big treat to the people in the office of JN Entertainment.\u00a0The dinner was decided to be held at an expensive Korean beef house, where it would cost more than 100,000 won for even just two people, so there were even people who waited several days for today.Sitting in the middle of the noisy get-together, Choi Inseop thought he had come for nothing and ate only salad quietly.\u2018I\u2019m troubled\u2026\u2019Inseop put his chopsticks in his mouth and muttered to himself.He came because manager Cha asked him to come, but he was not used to this kind of atmosphere.\u00a0Besides, it was very difficult to face Lee Wooyeon and the faces of people he knew immediately after such an incident.More than anything\u2026\u201cMr. Wooyeon.\u00a0You seem to have a lot of free time these days?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Probably.\u201d\u201cMr. Kang Youngmo should get well soon.\u201d\u201cHe must.\u00a0But on the other hand, I think he can get better slowly.\u00a0It\u2019s been a while since I took a breather.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s joke, the female employees from the office laughed.\u00a0Although CEO Kim invited celebrities belonging to the company to the dinner party today, Lee Wooyeon usually never came to a place like this.\u00a0So, as a courtesy, he told him the time and place, but no one expected that he would really come.In particular, CEO Kim, Manager Cha, and Choi Inseop.\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cDid you tell him the place and time?\u201d\u201cI mean, when I told Inseop, he was standing next to him.\u00a0So I told him to come on time too.\u00a0But I hoped he will not come\u2026\u00a0.\u201dEven though the filming of the drama was delayed because of Kang Youngmo and there was no special schedule, he did not think that Lee Wooyeon would attend the dinner.\u00a0Among the female employees of JN Entertainment, there were many people who joined the company with the expectation that they would be able to eat together with Lee Wooyeon, but none of them realized that expectation.\u00a0Because Lee Wooyeon strictly separated private and public meetings, he did not even attend company dinners.\u00a0But today, for some reason, he appeared here with Inseop.\u00a0Thanks to this, CEO Kim and Manager Cha had to watch the scene where Lee Wooyeon sat in the middle and got the envy and affection from people all at once.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon made a face like he was familiar with the attention that was pouring on him, and responded kindly to each and every staff member.\u00a0People were exhausted looking after celebrities, but they didn\u2019t have a chance to see Lee Wooyeon up close for such a long time, so everyone had a conversation with him with their eyes shining.\u00a0The only person who looked depressed was Choi Inseop, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, who has been eating only vegetables since before.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Eat some meat.\u00a0Why are you only eating salad at an expensive Korean beef restaurant?\u201d\u201cCEO Kim said he\u2019ll treat us properly today, so don\u2019t worry about it and eat.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u00a0Thank you.\u201dPeople put meat in front of Inseop.\u00a0Inseop didn\u2019t really like meat.\u00a0Especially when he was not feeling well like these days, even just smelling the meat made him sick.Still wanting to eat what was given, Inseop put meat\u00a0 on top of a lettuce, and wrapped it.\u00a0Putting the lettuce-covered ssam in his mouth, Inseop chewed it well.\u201cHey, do you eat meat like that?\u00a0The ratio of meat to vegetables is meat, meat and vegetables, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe female employee who was sitting across from him saw Inseop wrapping the ssam and asked teasingly.\u201cIs that so?\u00a0haha\u2026, meat\u2026Vegetables on meat.\u201dInseop wrapped the wrap as she told him and\u00a0asked \u2018Like this?\u2019.\u00a0At Korean dinner parties, he believed that doing what people told him to do was a way to set the mood.\u00a0Even the thought of eating all of this made him sick to his stomach, but Inseop thought that there was nothing he could do, so he gathered the wraps and grabbed them.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting next to him, saw this and grabbed Inseop\u2019s wrist with a grin.\u201cHow are you going to eat it all?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0 I\u2019m going to try one.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t eat meat.\u00a0Just give me.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand and made him put the ssam in his mouth.\u00a0The female employees who were sitting around were screaming and making a fuss.\u201cI also want to feed one to Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cI also want to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy for you Mr Wooyeon..\u00a0There are so many pretty manager candidates.\u201d\u201cI also want to change mine with a pretty manager.\u00a0My manager looks like a bear, and he just eats.\u201dOther actors who were in attendance joked with Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon answered with a sly smile.\u201cMy manager is Mr. Inseop.\u00a0I don\u2019t need another manager.\u201dThe female employees looked at Inseop with envy.\u00a0They said that it must be great to be by Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side all day, even if he was a man.\u00a0Of course, he was always busy, but their logic was that it was good to be the manager of someone like Lee Wooyeon who was kind and personable.\u00a0There were some people who would work without pay if they had a chance..Director Cha drank soju and clicked his tongue when he saw people talking about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fake personality.\u201cSo Inseop will continue to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager?\u00a0Didn\u2019t you stop because you were studying for civil service?\u201dLee Dayoung, the youngest member of the PR team, who had just joined the company, asked.\u201cYes.\u00a0It was something that I wanted to do.\u201d\u201cI think you would do well as a civil servant.\u00a0There are rumors in the office that Inseop is meticulous and does a good job.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cHow old are you?\u00a0I think you\u2019re about the same age as me.\u201dInseop hesitated for a moment, then said he was 26, like the one in his fake identity card.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon drank alcohol next to him without a word.\u201cTwenty six?\u00a0You are two years older than me.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dInseop calculated her age by himself and asked her if she was 24. As he said this without any reaction, people around him poked Inseop\u2019s side and said,\u201cAt times like this, you have to tell her to talk to you comfortably.\u00a0Call me oppa, something like that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Op, Oppa\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cHey, how can I call him oppa just after meeting him?\u00a0Isn\u2019t that right?\u00a0Inseop oppa.\u201dWhen Lee Dayoung cleverly called him oppa, the people around him burst into laughter.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who was actually of the same age, felt guilty and embarrassed that she called him oppa, and only sweated profusely.\u201cThe word \u2018oppa\u2019 is really strange.\u201dSuddenly, Lee Wooyeon spoke.\u00a0It was a quiet and low voice, but it had the power to gain the attention of the noisy drinking party at once.\u201cWhen I first came to Korea, I was surprised that people were casually calling me oppa.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u00a0I guess so.\u00a0Because all the girls call you oppa.\u201d\u201cIt felt like all of a sudden I had a huge number of sisters.\u201dLee Wooyeon replied with a smile.He didn\u2019t even care about the younger sister he had anyway, so there was nothing special about adding a huge number of younger sisters to it.\u201cHow can you call them little sisters?\u00a0Those people must have a dark heart for Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cI know, right.\u00a0But if they keep calling me oppa, I think of them as a little sister.\u201d\u201cThen what should I call you to let you think of me as a woman?\u201dThe head of the PR team, the oldest among the women in the office, handed Lee Wooyeon a drink and asked.\u201cI never thought of that. Hm.\u00a0Well.\u201dLee Wooyeon was immersed in thought, making a slight expression with a worried tone.\u00a0The female employees who watched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s every move up close watched him agonize, wondering what kind of jackpot this was.He never thought about what someone should call him to be recognized as a woman.\u00a0If she was pretty and had a hole he could put it in, she was a woman.\u00a0But these days\u2026Lee Wooyeon glanced at Inseop, who was contemplating whether to put lettuce on top of another lettuce, put a piece of meat, and add another lettuce.He doesn\u2019t have a particularly pretty face, he was a man, but he was often perceived as a \u2018woman\u2019.\u00a0Was it because he had a hole to put it in?\u00a0No, if it was about holes, it won\u2019t matter since everyone has one.Lee Wooyeon daringly came all the way here and smiled bitterly at Inseop eating lettuce.\u00a0When their eyes met, Choi Inseop turned his head with a surprised face.\u00a0He looked like a high school girl he met on the street.\u00a0Since he sent Baek Heejin back that day and held Choi Inseop, even if he only made eye contact, he blatantly showed embarrassment and discomfort.Even though he told him not to, he still looked like that.When he got home today, he thought that he would have to pay close attention, and Lee Wooyeon picked up a glass of wine.\u201cAh, they\u2019re here again.\u201dKim Sejun, who was sitting at the table next to him, frowned and grumbled.\u00a0After working as a model in Japan, he was currently an actor and model, and there were many fans who followed him like a stalker.\u00a0Even today, fans waiting for him outside the store were encamped with cameras.\u201cHow the hell do they know?\u00a0Is someone from our company selling information to them?\u201dAs Kim Sejun murmured, Lee Wooyeon agreed, and responded with a light tone.\u00a0Inseop, who was eating lettuce wrap by himself, was stabbed and shrugged.\u201cWho was one of those singers before?\u00a0Anyway, when he went home, the stalker came while he was eating alone while watching TV, he said. \u2018Cause it\u2019s really sad.\u00a0I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve moved out because of crazy kids who keep coming in with the door key\u2019.\u201d\u201cI amazed to see them.\u00a0Most of them are students, but where did they get the money from?\u201d\u201cYou should be happy it\u2019s a student.\u00a0I have an aunty who has been following me since last year, and it\u2019s really scary.\u00a0I used to run into that woman and she was swearing at the actress whom I had a scandal with in the lobby of the broadcasting station.\u00a0She keeps giving me food that she made herself, but I can\u2019t eat it.\u201dStories of stalkers that could not be heard without tears poured out from celebrities sitting nearby.\u201cWhat about you, senior?\u00a0How many stalkers are following you?\u201dOne of them asked Lee Wooyeon a question.\u201cThere are a few.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop lost the thought of eating lettuce wrap and quietly put the lettuce down on his bowl.\u201cOf course, since Wooyeon is very popular, there must be a lot of people following him.\u00a0Right?\u201d\u201cNot that many.\u00a0I am rather quiet.\u201dLee Wooyeon did not appear on show programs or talk shows.\u00a0Interviews were almost all done for the promotion of dramas and movies on entertainment programs.\u00a0There were people who criticized Lee Wooyeon, saying that it was all a high-level strategy, but Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t care.\u00a0This was because he thought that being a celebrity was a business that earned him money by selling images anyway, so he can do whatever suits his taste.Perhaps because of his quiet activities, there were not many stalker fans compared to his popularity.\u201cOf course, there were some people who were a little unusual.\u201d\u201cWho was it?\u201d\u201cHe said he had to go through all sorts of hardships from the US to Korea because of me.\u201d\u201cHuh, really?\u00a0What\u2019s up with that?\u00a0I hate it.\u201d\u201cSo, they came to Korea to see Lee Wooyeon and followed you?\u00a0With that kind of sincerity, they will do anything.\u00a0How did you know about that?\u201d\u201cThey stood out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have said I\u2019d come. When Lee Wooyeon said he would follow me, I should have just said I wouldn\u2019t go either.\u2019Choi Inseop started to think about when he should stand up while fiddling with the lettuce.\u201cInseop must have had a lot of trouble because of the many fans of Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Have a drink.\u00a0I will give it to you.\u201dThe PR team leader stood up with a bottle of wine.\u00a0Inseop put his glass down on the table and shook his head.\u201cYou are not allowed to say no today and drink it.\u201d\u201cYou can call a driver.\u201d\u201cI have to take Lee Wooyeon home.\u201d\u201cCall the driver, driver.\u00a0CEO, will you give them the money for a driver?\u201d\u201cSure.\u00a0Eat and drink with peace of mind today.\u201dWhen CEO Kim, who was seated at the back, returned a blunt answer, Team Manager Hong recommended Inseop to drink again.\u201cLook.\u00a0Today is a drinking day.\u201dInseop glanced at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t like to call a driver.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon first told him not to drink alcohol today and came to the party, so Inseop had to keep an eye on him.Lee Wooyeon smiled and made eye contact with Inseop.\u00a0Inseop was able to read the truth hidden in his smile, which was bent like a crescent moon.\u2018Go ahead, just try drinking it.\u2019\u201cNo.\u00a0I just won\u2019t drink today.\u00a0I don\u2019t feel good..\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Are you sick?\u201dWhen Lee Dayoung asked, people around her booed her.\u201cWhat?\u00a0Dayoung.\u00a0You\u2019re only taking care of Mr. Inseop.\u00a0You called him oppa, but what if he becomes a father?\u201d\u201cWhy am I becoming Lee Dayoung\u2019s father?\u201dInseop was surprised and asked, unable to understand the Korean pun about \u201cOppa becomes a father\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s just a joke.\u00a0Why are you so serious?\u201d\u201cYes?\u00a0uh\u2026 I\u2019m not being serious\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dLee Wooyeon watched the scene where Inseop was confused and mumbling as if it was fun.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying, so he just asked, but when the other person responded like that, it was clear that he was groaning inside.\u00a0After a while, maybe\u2026\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Miss\u00a0Dayoung.\u00a0I think I made a mistake.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0No.\u00a0I know it\u2019s a joke, okay?\u201dWhen she answered with a smile, Inseop seemed relieved.\u00a0He knew it would be like that.\u00a0Choi Inseop responded as expected, and Lee Wooyeon laughed.After understanding Choi Inseop\u2019s intentions to some extent, looking at his actions, things that he did not understand before came into order and caught his eye.\u00a0He thought he was the type that was difficult to understand, but he was a very simple human being.\u00a0Still, it was fun to watch, and it was entertaining.\u201cOh right.\u00a0Wooyeon, you know we\u2019re going to Hawaii for a photo shoot this weekend, right?It was in a hurry, so I got a call and checked the schedule, but it still bothered me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0I heard.\u00a0Inseop gave it to me.\u201d\u201cThe photographer suddenly changed his schedule because he only had time then. I guess that\u2019s why the magazine is on alert. I need to reserve a plane ticket, get a hotel, and get a place. You must be having a hard time preparing in a hurry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0I don\u2019t have much work right now, but I will go on a trip.\u201d\u201cAre you going with Inseop too?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI envy you!\u00a0Lee Wooyeon and Hawaii.\u00a0I want to go instead.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m envious too.\u00a0I also want to go to Hawaii with Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cCEO.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager is absolutely not allowed to be a woman, right?\u201dWhen the female employees asked a question mixed with resentment, CEO Kim crossed his hands with a face that said what kind of bullshit.\u201cNo.\u00a0no way. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager has always been a man, and will continue to be a man.\u00a0Women will not do.\u201dCEO Kim, who knew how much Lee Wooyeon liked women, and was so upset that he was against the jokes of the employees, was also sympathetic.\u201cWell, if it\u2019s a woman, it\u2019s a back-professional scandal, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.\u00a0Being together all day, if you\u2019re a woman, there\u2019s no way we can\u2019t get along.\u201d\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d fall in love if I were your manager.\u201d\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Be careful not to fall in love.\u201dChoi Inseop\u2019s heart became heavy at the jokes people shared while giggling.He wanted to cry.Had he known that he was such a person, he would have been more careful.\u00a0Why does he have to be this kind of person\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he wanted to go home soon.\u201cI\u2019ll go to the bathroom for a while.\u201dHe wondered who would care, but Inseop mumbled his destination and stood up.\u00a0Since the store was all rented by CEO Kim, there was no one in the bathroom.He zipped his pants down and was about to do some errands, but someone opened the door and came in.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cAre you crying again?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked as he closed the bathroom door.\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cI see.\u00a0I thought you were crying, so I came to take a look.\u201dHe washed his hands in the sink.\u00a0Inseop was frozen in front of the toilet, waiting for him to leave.\u201cAen\u2019t you peeing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Is it uncomfortable because I\u2019m here?\u00a0Why? I\u2019m a person who even saw Inseop\u2019s asshole.\u201dIt was such a vulgar transformation that it was hard to believe that he was the same person as the man who had sat down a while ago and was smiling like someone from a public service advertisement.Lee Wooyeon came up to Inseop\u2019s side and looked down at him and smiled.\u00a0If you\u2019re a man, you can\u2019t help but be sensitive to how the other person reacts when yo\u2019\u2019re laying down.\u00a0Besides, it was right after that happened with Lee Wooyeon, so Inseop was even more disturbed by his reaction.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock is so cute.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cCome out when you\u2019re done.\u201dLee Wooyeon patted Inseop on the shoulder and left.\u00a0Inseop lost his will to use the restroom with the rush of despair and zipped up his pants again.\u00a0When he looked in the mirror while washing his hands in the sink, his face was also flushed red.\u00a0Choi Inseop washed his face in cold water, cooled down for a while, and then went out of the bathroom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The hottest topic at the party was about love affairs, as almost all but a few team leader-level employees were unmarried men and women.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much my mother worries because I work here.\u00a0She says that since I work with celebrities, I am more picky, so I might see issues with everyone and not get married.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0So does my mother.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try getting a little more attention by ignoring their issues?\u00a0ha\u2026\u00a0Is there any good-looking, kind-hearted, wealthy, blind man who likes me?\u201d\u201cWhat about me? Me.\u201d\u201cKyungsoo is ugly, has a belly and has no money!\u201d\u201cAre you blind?\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u201dEveryone burst out laughing.\u00a0In a friendly atmosphere, Inseop sat quietly so as not to break the excitement.\u201cDoes Inseop have a girlfriend?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGirlfriend.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have one.\u201dIt was Lee Wooyeon who answered.\u201cHow do you know that, Mr. Wooyeon?\u00a0Because, by nature, gentle people are good at dating.\u00a0If you think about it, even when I was in school, the most docile and feminine girls got married early.\u201d\u201cRight.\u00a0Those kids were getting married early.\u00a0If you watch him closely, Inseop might have a lot of girlfriends.\u201d\u201cMr Inseop doesn\u2019t have any.\u201dLee Wooyeon replied with a smile.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t?\u00a0Really?\u00a0May I introduce you to someone?\u201dTeam leader Hong asked Inseop implicitly.\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cChief Hong.\u00a0Why didn\u2019t you introduce them to me and only to Inseop?\u201d\u201cYou only drink and flirt.\u00a0Not a man like you, but a real man is like him.\u00a0Because he is a family man, sincere, and kind.\u00a0How about it?\u00a0Mr Inseop.\u00a0If you have any thoughts, tell me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0Not yet, I don\u2019t intend to.\u201d\u201cThen when are you going to have that thought?\u201dInseop turned his head to Lee Wooyeon at the question.\u00a0As soon as his eyes met, Inseop\u2019s goosebumps rose.\u00a0He had a glass of wine in his mouth, so he couldn\u2019t see his lips clearly, but Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes were smiling coldly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t think about it now, it will happen later.\u00a0Right?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Are you worried that Inseop will quit as your manager if he gets married?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0I am also worried.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled again and turned his head.\u00a0Seeing that his tone had loosened, Inseop sighed.\u00a0No way.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon won\u2019t get angry in front of so many people.While Choi Inseop was soothing his heart, the topic of the drinking party shifted to a movie that was released a while ago.\u201cThe female lead in that movie really looked just like my first love.\u201d\u201cAh, where can you find such a first love on Hyungsik\u2019s face?\u201d\u201cFirst love is always beautiful.\u201d\u201cI heard that all the men who watched the movie shed tears saying it was their story.\u00a0They are the main characters of the movie.\u201d\u201cHave you seen the movie, Inseop?\u201d\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t seen any movies lately.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Don\u2019t you like movies?\u201d\u201cI like it.\u00a0But I don\u2019t have time\u2026\u201dHe liked movies.\u00a0When he was in the United States, he would go to the movies with his family once a week, and play a game of predicting the future of a movie by watching the trailers that were released before the release with Jennie.Lately, he has been watching and researching only the movies related to Lee Wooyeon dozens of times, so he hasn\u2019t thought of looking into other movies at all.\u00a0Come to think of it, how long has it been since he went to the movies?\u00a0Inseop was quite surprised when he counted the date by himself in his head.\u201cI haven\u2019t watched in a really long time\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go see later.\u00a0After dinner with the people in our office, sometimes we go to a late-night movie.\u201d\u201cOkay. Mr\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Let\u2019s go together.\u201dThese days, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s schedule has lightened, so he has more time than before, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he has his own personal free time.\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Do you want to go out with your lover later?\u201d\u201cIt could be. He\u2019s trying\u00a0to sneak away.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019m not trying to sneak away.\u201d\u201cHey, look at how red your face is. You really are dating someone.\u201dInseop waved his hand vigorously in denial, but those who had fun at his naive reaction continued joking.\u201cI am not dating anyone.\u00a0Really.\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re too bright and in denial, I\u2019m more suspicious for some reason.\u00a0Haven\u2019t you seen Inseop\u2019s girlfriend before?\u201d\u201cHow do you see someone who doesn\u2019t exist?\u00a0I don\u2019t have a superpower.\u201dA cold reply came back.The deputy, who had just been joking and joking a while ago, looked back at Lee Wooyeon with a firm face.\u201cWooyeon, is there anything that\u2019s making you angry?\u201d\u201cIs that even possible?\u00a0In such a good place.\u201dFortunately, a soft reply came back.\u00a0The reassured people started making noise again.\u00a0Choi Inseop glanced at Lee Wooyeon just in case.\u00a0The side view of Lee Wooyeon, who occasionally chatted with the actors at the table next to him while drinking, didn\u2019t look particularly strange.\u2018I\u2019m a little worried.\u00a0Let\u2019s not worry.\u2019Inseop nodded his head as he ate the vegetables that came with it.\u201cMy first love was really pretty, but in the end she met a doctor and got married.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a movie.\u00a0But Kihoon does not have the main character\u2019s face, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t Wooyeon have a first love?\u201d\u201cMe?\u00a0Of course I do.\u201d\u201cHuh, really?\u00a0Who is Lee Wooyeon\u2019s first love?\u00a0Tell me quickly. It\u2019s a good thing there aren\u2019t any reporters here.\u00a0Or it will be the sports newspaper scoop tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u00a0I want to listen.\u201dPeople perked up their ears to hear about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s veiled past.\u00a0Inseop, who was just about to chew a cucumber, put it down on the table.\u201cI was a book lover.\u00a0They also liked books, so we met at the library, and we exchanged contact information while talking about books.\u00a0That\u2019s it.\u201dFirst love with a girl he met at the library.Somehow he was like Lee Wooyeon, and sometimes he was not.\u00a0Inseop drank the beverage alone with a strange feeling.\u201cSo what happened?\u201d\u201cIf your first love comes true, is it your first love?\u00a0That\u2019s why it\u2019s so affectionate.\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201d\u201cI still get calls from time to time.\u00a0But once a month.\u201d\u201cOn the phone?\u201d\u201cThey send a postcard.\u00a0Like a verse of a poem.\u201d\u201cWow, so romantic.\u201d\u201cIs this something that would appear in a romance movie?\u201dInseop choked on the cider he was drinking.\u00a0People were talking about Lee Wooyeon\u2019s romantic first love anecdote.Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon, wiping the spilled cider on his clothes with a tissue.\u00a0He was conversing with the people sitting opposite him with a bewitching smile.\u2018Ah, this guy is really bad.\u00a0How dare you lie like that.\u2019The postcard was what Inseop was sending him.\u00a0It was all Jennie\u2019s will.\u00a0In her will, it was written that the postcards she had collected were for Peter.\u00a0He kept the box full of postcards, but while reading Jennie\u2019s diary, he found words that she couldn\u2019t send to Philip, one by one.\u00a0Even when she said she hated Philip, she said that she desperately wanted him to remember her.He decided to send her words out. The words that Jenny had not been able to say, he sent them out as postcards to Lee Wooyeon one by one, every month.Watching Lee Wooyeon make up a story about it, saying it was the woman he met at the library, or the first love that didn\u2019t come true, Inseop was terribly heartbroken.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0A person like that is Jennie\u2019s first love.\u201cDoes Inseop not have a first love?\u201d\u201cFi, first love? \u2026There was\u2026\u201dPeople turned their attention to him as Inseop muffled his words with a bitter face.\u201cThere was, but what?\u00a0Are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Yes.\u201dIt was not going well.\u00a0Inseop nodded, remembering the ongoing ruin of his first love.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it was a bad person?\u201dLee Wooyeon interrupted the conversation.\u201cWho is it?\u00a0Mr. Inseop, is your first love a bad girl?\u201d\u201cYou said that to me last time.\u00a0She was a bad person.\u201dA subtle smile appeared in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes as he said that.\u201cShe was a bad person.\u00a0Gold-digger style?\u201d\u201cSo if it didn\u2019t go well, it\u2019s rather good for you.\u201dLee Dayoung offered words of comfort to Inseop and said,\u201cMr. Inseop, beware of bad girls.\u00a0You need to find a good woman.\u201d\u201cOh, Dayoung.\u00a0Are you already worried about Inseop oppa?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little worried about Mr. Inseop.\u00a0He looks like he\u2019ll get caught by a bad girl and get sucked in with a straw on his back.\u201d\u201cStraw\u2026\u201dAs if he remembered a terrible scene, Inseop made a sharp expression.\u201cDon\u2019t date that kind of woman, but meet a good woman in the future.\u201dLee Dayoung smiled and gave Inseop a word of advice.\u00a0People booed and teased Dayoung, but she laughed as if she didn\u2019t care.\u201cYes.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0I will do that.\u201dInseop smiled and nodded his head as she was kind, taking care of him, who was a stranger whom she saw for the first time today.The atmosphere at the party was getting more and more ripe.\u00a0People applauded and rejoiced as the drunken manager Cha sang and danced.While drinking cider, Inseop changed his mind that it was good he came to the party.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t fully assimilated into this atmosphere, but just seeing people living happily made him feel better.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t go home today!\u201dCEO Kim, who got into the atmosphere, shouted to the people to go for karaoke.\u00a0Manager Cha came, screamed and drove people away.Lee Wooyeon, who got up from his seat, said he\u2019ll go first.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Do you have a schedule for tomorrow morning, Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cThen Inseop will go too.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that, both of you go to the second round together.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little tired.\u201dInseop tilted his head.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon doesn\u2019t really say that he\u2019s tired.\u00a0But seeing as he was talking since a while ago, it seems that he was not in a good condition\u2026 he also wanted to visit the place called karaoke, but it was a pity.\u201cHey, come on.\u201dCEO Kim beckoned to Lee Wookyeon.\u00a0It was a fight that said, \u201cIt\u2019s like a scoundrel has moved away.\u201d\u201cI will leave now.\u00a0It was fun today.\u00a0Have fun everyone.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and said goodbye.\u00a0Inseop bowed to the people behind him as well.\u00a0Everyone waved and left the store.\u00a0Inseop put on his shoes and glanced at Lee Wooyeon.\u2026He certainly didn\u2019t look good.In this case, it was best not to speak.\u00a0Inseop and Lee Wooyeon went down to the parking lot and he walked as far away from him as possible.As he opened the door of the van he had parked, Lee Wooyeon suddenly grabbed Inseop\u2019s arm from behind.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cCome here.\u201dBefore he could ask why, Lee Wooyeon dragged Inseop to the back seat and closed the door.\u00a0Since he had had the same experience before, Inseop looked up at Lee Wooyeon, trembling with anxiety.\u201cWhy, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Is that so?\u201dEven then, it was an incomprehensible situation, because since it was against Lee Wooyeon to help Kang Youngmo pee, today, he did not make any mistakes.\u00a0He was told not to drink alcohol, so he only drank cider and answered people\u2019s comments as politely as possible and never did anything strange.Inseop\u2019s heart felt like it was being ripped apart from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cold gaze as he looked at him.\u00a0However, looking back, he did not make any mistakes today, so he raised his head and gathered up the courage to ask again.\u201cWhy are you like that?\u00a0Did Ido something wrong?\u201dLee Wooyeon answered that he didn\u2019t and shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s just that I feel dirty.\u201dHaving said that, Lee Wooyeon looked through the suitcase hanging behind the van and pulled out a tie.\u201cPut your hands behind your back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Why?\u201d\u201cAnyway, even if you resist, the result will be the same.\u00a0So just relax and do it.\u201dWho in the world would be willing to respond when a man holding a tie asks you to put your hands behind you?\u00a0Inseop desperately resisted.\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u00a0Why am I\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s words were true.\u00a0He lightly subdued Inseop with one hand and began to tie his hands with a tie.\u00a0It happened in an instant.Choi Inseop shouted.\u201cI don\u2019t like it. Lee\u00a0Wooyeon, I don\u2019t want this.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cWhat am I doing now?\u201dLee Wooyeon said and smiled.\u00a0Inseop noticed that he was very angry.\u00a0But since he couldn\u2019t figure out the reason, he was also embarrassed and angry.\u201cPlease release me.\u00a0My hands, please.\u201d\u201cStay still.\u00a0Your finger bones haven\u2019t fully attached yet, so you\u2019ll get hurt.\u201dHe spoke worriedly, but he pulled tightly several times to check the tie that tied his hands.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cWhat happened, \u2026\u00a0!\u00a0What are you doing?\u201dLee Wooyeon unbuckled Inseop\u2019s pants from behind.\u00a0He tried to free his hand, but to no avail.\u00a0He pulled down Inseop\u2019s underwear along with his pants at once.\u00a0The shame he felt became even more because of the cold air that hit his skin when his pants were taken off.\u201cI don\u2019t like it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ah, don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI decide whether I do it or not.\u00a0You should just stand with your legs spread out.\u201d\u201cWhy do I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cBecause.\u00a0You were meant to do that.\u201dLee Wooyeon said calmly.\u201cYou agreed to it that day, and you came to me.\u00a0You signed a contract.\u201d\u201cThe contract is for a public relationship with the company, and I never mentioned anything like this\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0I never did.\u201d\u201cIs it?\u201d Lee Wooyeon asked and he tilted his head slightly and continued.\u201cThen do it now.\u00a0Choi Inseop likes me, and that\u2019s why he did such suspicious things.\u00a0I have to believe you, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cSex will enter into that relationship of faith from now on.\u00a0You will spread your legs if I want.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll call Choi Inseop.\u00a0I think that Choi Inseop might have something to do with the Korean-Chinese who beat me and Kang Youngmo.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u00a0There is no such thing.\u00a0He has nothing to do with it.\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u00a0I just feel like that.\u00a0There\u2019s nothing wrong with being careful.\u00a0I\u2019m going to tell the police, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily constitute a crime, so don\u2019t worry too much.\u201dIt was a threat.The person who lent his name to him had no connection with the Korean-Chinese, and it was Lee Wooyeon who struck Kang Youngmo, so it was an absurd threat.\u00a0Still, Inseop could not ignore Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know how he did it, but seeing that the Korean-Chinese went willingly and confessed that he had done something he hadn\u2019t done, Lee Wooyeon was no ordinary person.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u00a0If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll let you go..\u00a0Without laying even a finger on you, I can let you go out of here on your own two feet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cLooking at the silence, it means that Inseop wants me to do it too, right?\u201dLee Wooyeon made Inseop lie down on the car seat.\u00a0And once again asked for confirmation.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Don\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t like it.\u00a0Be sure to say it.\u201dWhile speaking, Lee Wooyeon gently rubbed the bulging underside of Inseop\u2019s buttocks.\u00a0Inseop buried his head in the sheet and bit his lip.\u201cIf you don\u2019t object, spread your legs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cCome on, spread your legs.\u00a0You\u2019re not a virgin anymore.\u00a0Now, spread your legs.\u201dLee Wooyeon touched Inseop\u2019s thigh and whispered.\u00a0Inseop held back his tears and slowly spread his legs to the side.\u00a0Then, Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s waist and thrust his cock between his buttocks.\u201c\u2015\u2015!!\u201dInseop\u2019s eyes flashed white with pain when it was inserted without any preparation.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon breathed in from behind and said,\u201cDon\u2019t be stiff like that.\u00a0Breathe slowly and relax.\u201d\u201cIt hurts\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2015\u2015!\u201dLee Wooyeon lifted his waist again with all his might.\u00a0His hard thighs hit Inseop\u2019s thighs.\u00a0The hot cock pushed in through the tight gap.\u00a0Because his hands were tied behind his back, Inseop could not balance his body and buried his head in the seat.\u201cYou spread your legs and now you lift your ass?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0The pain was so bad that he couldn\u2019t put any strength in his back.\u00a0Nevertheless, Lee Wooyeon thrusted in all the way without stopping.\u201c\u2026\u00a0went all the way in.\u00a0Do you know how far my dick has reached?\u201dLee Wooyeon questioned while pressing the bulging part near Inseop\u2019s belly with his hand.\u201cHere it is.\u00a0Up to this point, my cock is piercing through Mr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cHu\u2026rts\u2015\u2015, ugh\u2015.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0As his body swayed and moved, his hole loosened slightly.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled him back and pushed into him as hard as he could.\u00a0Inseop groaned.\u00a0Every time Lee Wooyeon moved, his hard penis pounded on the inside of his stomach.\u00a0Choi Inseop collapsed on the seat with a gasp.Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s butt and moved his waist without a break.\u00a0Inseop cried several times and begged him to slow down, but the more he did, the faster he moved his waist.\u201cDo people know?\u00a0Choi Inseop looks calm and naive\u2026 but you\u2019re eating my cock as if it was delicious.\u201d\u201cOh, uh\u2026\u00a0Woo,yeon\u2026\u00a0, Ah\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Agh\u201dLee Wooyeon ran his hand in front of him and grabbed Inseop\u2019s genitals.\u00a0As he stoked his drooping dick, little by little, it began to harden.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled softly from behind.\u201cEven if I touch you a little, your cock gets hard, and if I thrust into you even a little bit, you moan and drool.\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u00a0Uh, ah\u2013, uh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ah!Sl, slowly\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Ah.\u201d\u201cDo you want to work with Dayoung?\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed into Inseop and asked.\u00a0Inseop shook his head.\u00a0It was the first time he met Lee Dayoung, and he had never imagined doing this to anyone.\u201cBut why are you drooling like that?\u00a0What would they say if they found out that Choi Inseop is like this, spreading your legs to a man and swallowing him through your hole?\u201d\u201cNo, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u00a0!\u201d\u201cAre you still going to be introduced to a woman?\u00a0Are you curious?\u201dLee Wooyeon made Inseop raise his head.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled as he wiped his tear-stained face.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that people don\u2019t know this.\u201dIt was so pretty.No one knows how pretty it is to see him crying with his messy hair, his face blushing, his ass raised back.Lee Wooyeon stroked Inseop\u2019s hair and touched the back of his neck.\u00a0As his fingertips brushed his skin, Inseop shuttered and shook his head.\u00a0Interestingly, Choi Inseop felt like he didn\u2019t know what to do if he caressed him so tenderly.As proof of that, Inseop\u2019s flesh in the palm of his hand swelled even harder than before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon moved his waist as he ran his hand over Inseop\u2019s.\u201cAh, uh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, uh, ah!\u00a0Ugh\u2013\u201dAs he felt a sudden pleasure back and forth, Inseop moaned and twisted his back.\u00a0In the midst of that, him stuttering and saying no with his mouth fueled Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cruel desire.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Choi Inseop\u2019s pussy eating my dick?\u00a0Huh?\u201d\u201cHa, uh, ah!\u00a0Wooyeon\u2013.Wai, wait\u2013, ah!\u201d\u201cUh\u2013, fuck, meet someone.\u00a0Do you want to meet a woman with this body, the body that clenches me from your hole?\u201dA voice came from behind his back.\u00a0Inseop was banging his head on the seat whenever Lee Wooyeon moved his waist, so he couldn\u2019t understand what he meant.\u00a0His arms were tied behind his back, making it difficult to even move.\u00a0Breathing was all he could do.\u00a0Inseop took a breath as hot as fire and begged Lee Wooyeon to slow it down.\u201cPlease, \u2015\u2015slow, slow down\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ah\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to take it slow?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ah, it hurts\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m out of breath\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon reached out and placed his hand on Inseop\u2019s chest.\u00a0Checking the heartbeat with his palm, he gave a glance.\u201cHow much is too much?\u00a0Your heart is beating like crazy right now.\u201dAt first glance, there was a light of concern in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice.\u00a0His sudden concern made Inseop say something he didn\u2019t have to say without realizing it.\u201cThis is fine\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI see.\u00a0So far, it\u2019s fine.\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop\u2019s back again.\u00a0Feeling the tight weight of his cock between his legs, Inseop realized that he had made a mistake.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dAfter realizing it, it was too late.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon inserted it deeply again.\u00a0Inseop shuddered at the sensation that came slowly, a little different from before.\u00a0It was like putting a hot finger in and rubbing it against the inner wall.\u00a0As Inseop gasped while shaking his shoulders, Lee Wooyeon asked, as if wondering.\u201cI\u2019m taking it slow.\u00a0As Inseop wants\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ah\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh.\u201d\u201cSlowly, my cock is rubbing the inside of Mr. Inseop.\u00a0Is this what you wanted me to do?\u201dHe thought he was going to die.\u00a0His stomach was tickling all over and his lower back was tingling, so he just thought it would be nice if someone could do something about it.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body collapsed as if his legs were relaxed and he was sitting on the seat.\u201cIs it hard?\u00a0Then I\u2019ll do it more slowly.\u201d\u201cUh\u2013!\u201dLee Wooyeon stubbornly rubbed the narrowly closed inner wall with the tip of his cock.\u00a0Inseop let out a muffled moan and lifted his head.\u00a0please please\u2013.Lee Wooyeon, who read the soft unspoken request in the corner of his eyes, inquired.\u201cI will do whatever you want.\u00a0Tell me.\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015Agh\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever Inseop wants, so tell me.\u00a0If you don\u2019t tell me, how will I know?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s lips touched his ear.\u00a0Every time he whispered a word, a voice sweet as chocolate flowed into his ear.\u201cLet me go, let me go\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Agh\u201d\u201cYou have to be honest.\u00a0You\u2019re dripping wet, yet you still say that.\u201d\u201cRelease my hands\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon clicked his tongue.\u00a0Due to Inseop\u2019s personality, it took a lot of effort to bring out the words he wanted.\u00a0It was not a situation where he could wait for that now.\u00a0The desire he had been holding down with patience from before was slowly approaching its limit.\u201cThen I\u2019ll just hit you as I like.\u00a0Lean on me\u00a0Yes, like that.\u201dLee Wooyeon wrapped his arms around Inseop\u2019s shoulders and stood up.\u00a0With his butt clinging to his thigh, Lee Wooyeon began to shovel.\u201cAh!\u00a0Ah!\u00a0Uhh \u2026\u00a0Ah!Ah!\u00a0Ugh, too, too fast\u2026\u00a0ah, wait\u2026\u00a0wait.\u201d\u201cYour hole is too fussy.\u00a0Ugh, you cry even if I hit it slowly, you cry even if I hit it quickly.\u00a0But\u2013 it\u2019s delicious, so I\u2019ll close my eyes.\u201dA rustling sound echoed inside the car.\u00a0Inseop panted as if he was about to run out of breath and leaned on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u00a0While hugging the skinny body that was in his arm, Lee Wooyeon swallowed hard.\u00a0It was a very sensitive body.\u00a0Even with the slightest stimulation, Inseop trembled and tightened the bottom of his body.Even Lee Wooyeon, who went through all the hardships, sometimes felt suffocating, and it was so tight that he sometimes groaned hard.\u201cSpread your legs more.\u00a0I\u2019ll thrust in even deeper\u2013\u201d\u201cAh!\u00a0I, I, uh\u2013, uh!\u00a0Ah!\u00a0uh, uh.\u201dLee Wooyeon thrusted in deeper as if to crush the hot inner wall.\u00a0Inseop let out a moan mixed with weeping.\u00a0That was so good.\u201cDamn it, I\u2019m canceling that statement.\u00a0\u2015\u2015Don\u2019t let anyone see your face like this.\u201d\u201cAh, uh, ah.\u00a0Uhh\u2013\u00a0Now, wait\u2013, who, who\u2013\u201dWhen he heard people approaching from afar, Inseop turned his head to look at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0But Wooyeon only moved his waist even more fiercely.\u201cSomeone is coming\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0wait \u2026\u00a0\u201dAs Inseop said, people\u2019s voices were getting closer and closer.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s face turned white.\u00a0There were even familiar voices among them.\u201cIsn\u2019t that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s van?\u201d\u201cThey haven\u2019t gone yet?\u00a0Do you suppose they\u2019re inside?\u201d\u201cShall we go and ask them to go to the second round together?\u201dInseop trembled and looked up at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon smiled slowly and moved his waist once more.\u00a0Puck, puck, puck.\u00a0A piece of hard cock pushed inward tenaciously and hit one part.\u00a0Inseop bit his lip and barely endured the rising moan.People who came close to the car knocked on the window and called for Lee Wooyeon.\u201cMr. Wooyeon. Are you inside\u00a0Mr. Wooyeon.\u201dEven though he knew that they couldn\u2019t see the inside from the outside, he thought that they might be found out, and his blood went cold.\u00a0But Lee Wooyeon moved harder than before, as if it didn\u2019t matter.Of course, the one with the biggest scandal would be Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0One manager and the best actor in Korea had different ripple effects.\u00a0Nevertheless, Lee Wooyeon acted as if it was good for people to know.\u00a0Inseop bit his lips, holding back the sound.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, unable to see, put his finger on Inseop\u2019s lips.\u00a0There were no office people hanging around anymore near the car, and they went away as they talked about where they could\u2019ve gone.Only then did Choi Inseop open his mouth and let out a breath.\u201cHa\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are you so scared?\u201d\u201cOf, of course\u2026 I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dBecause of the tension that suddenly came and disappeared, Inseop trembled and shed tears.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said, \u201cShh,\u201d and comforted him.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u00a0Because everyone is gone.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, peo, people\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ugh.\u201dLee Wooyeon released his hand.\u00a0Then, holding him to his chest, he stroked his back with his hand.\u201cdon\u2019t cry.\u00a0They\u2019re all gone.\u00a0You endured it.\u201dNo matter how hard he tried not to make a sound, Inseop\u2019s lower lip was chewed to the point where his teeth marks were visible.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s expression on seeing that was not good.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0Now that they\u2019re all gone, you can pant to your heart\u2019s content.\u201dAs Inseop tried to pull himself back, Lee Wooyeon hugged his waist tightly and whispered.\u201cYou put your arms around like this and lean on my shoulder.\u00a0I\u2019ll put it in soon and finish it inside.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u201dIt was a gentle tone that seemed to soothe a crying child, but the content was vulgar.\u201cNo, just\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ah\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon lifted Inseop\u2019s buttocks and spread them to the side, and then inserted cock that was hardening with desire.\u00a0Inseop screamed and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0From then on, Lee Wooyeon rushed forward with such force that Inseop\u2019s memories faded away.\u00a0As a hungry predator plucks blood dripping from meat, he brutally slits Inseop\u2019s body apart.He went in and out with force, and then he put it back in again, and then he let out a murky groan and increased the speed of his movement.\u00a0Inseop cried and begged him to stop.\u00a0His genitals, which had withered slightly from fear of being caught by people, were half-up and shaking.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rubbed it with his stomach and pushed Inseop.\u201cOh, Ahh, ah!\u00a0Please, ah\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Woo\u2026yeon\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, plea\u2026,Ah!!\u201dInseop reached his climax first. His grayish semen was sprayed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hard stomach.\u00a0The inner wall, which had contracted at its peak, tightened around Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cock.\u00a0In an instant, Lee Wooyeon thrusted into him and held his waist.\u00a0Hot semen splattered into the clenching hole.Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s ass again and pushed his cock deeply.\u00a0Once again, semen was pouring out of the tip.\u00a0After repeating this a couple of times, Inseop\u2019s body drooped helplessly.Lee Wooyeon made him lean on his shoulder.\u00a0He wiped his sweat-drenched hair with his palm.\u00a0With such a friendly touch, Inseop did not even recognize where he was right now, and gave up his consciousness to sleep, blinking.Each time he opened and closed his eyes, a more and more heavy sleep took over his consciousness.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201dInseop raised his head in surprise at the sound of a man quietly calling out his name.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled softly and said unexpected words.\u201cNext time, shall we go see a movie?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to commit a crime..\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop couldn\u2019t answer that because it seemed like he was committing a crime.\u201cBut is it really okay to park here?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be help.\u00a0The underground parking lot is being painted.\u201dHe had to park the car in a nearby street parking lot because it was under construction today.\u00a0Inseop always preferred the underground parking lot because the parking lot above\u00a0 attracted people\u2019s attention even if they parked in a corner.\u00a0Besides, Lee Wooyeons car he was currently driving in wasn\u2019t a common car model, so it drew more people\u2019s attention.\u00a0Luckily it wasn\u2019t a van because a van was a clear pointer that said, \u201cThere is a celebrity in here,\u201d so that was not good..Inseop parked the car in the far corner and got out of the car.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who followed, put a cigarette in his mouth and lit it.\u00a0After begging Inseop for his understanding, he slowly inhaled the cigarette smoke and exhaled it.\u00a0Even though it was a natural action like flowing water, his eyes went straight to his eyes.\u00a0Every time Lee Wooyeon pursed his lips and sucked the cigarette filter, the cigarette burned.Cigarette smoke scattered into the air blurred Lee Wooyeon\u2019s surroundings.\u00a0In the midst of it, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s presence stood out clearly.In-eop deliberately turned his head to the other side and waited until he finished smoking.\u201cI\u2019m done. Let\u2019s go.\u201dLee Wooyeon threw the cigarette into the trash can.\u00a0Choi Inseop walked about a meter away from Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0It was a decent distance.\u00a0If he was too far away, he\u2019ll notice he was conscious, and if he got too close he\u2019d hear his heart pound.As he walked down the underground street connected to the movie theater, Inseop deliberately tried not to look at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0All the shops were closed and few people were walking on the street.\u00a0However, everyone passing by Lee Wo-yeon stopped and turned their heads to look at him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u00a0Watching movie like this and not like a movie premier.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWould you like some popcorn?\u201d\u201cYeah, if it\u2019s okay with you\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dUpon arriving in front of the theater, Lee Wooyeon took out his wallet in front of the canteen.\u00a0Choi Inseop said he\u2019ll pay, but to no avail.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon also paid for the movie tickets, so Inseop felt very uncomfortable.The theater part-timer who recognized Lee Wooyeon asked twice if he was really Lee Wooyeon in a surprised voice, and then gave him popcorn and a Coke. He asked for an autograph, but Lee Wooyeon refused because there was not much time left for the movie.Lee Wooyeon said as he handed the popcorn to Inseop.\u201cYou wanted to pay for popcorn, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Do you know how much income I earn a year?\u201d\u201cI know the rough amount\u201d\u201cSo you want to pay for the popcorn even though you know it?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked playfully while eating the popcorn that Inseop was holding.\u2026\u00a0he looks like a normal human being.Inseop sighed and answered.\u201cAnyway, money is all the same.\u00a0The money of rich people does not mean that it is not valuable.\u201d\u201cSay that to the people who tax my income.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about consulting with a tax accountant\u2026\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled cheerfully and handed out a ticket to the ticketing staff.\u00a0Again, the staff recognized him and greeted him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon bowed his head slightly and said to Inseop.\u201cCome quickly.\u00a0It\u2019s time for the movie to start.\u201dInseop took the popcorn and followed Lee Wooyeon into the cinema.\u00a0It was still advertising, so it was bright enough to see the inside of the movie theater.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Is there no one there?\u201d\u201cThere can be no one coming to see a movie like this at this hour.\u00a0Sit anywhere.\u201dLee Wooyeon took a seat in the middle without even thinking about checking the seat number.\u00a0Inseop hesitated for a moment and then sat down next to him.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even take off his coat, thinking that if the owner of the seat appeared, he would always have to get out of the way.\u201cNo one will come.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI booked the whole thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0then let me pay for the popcorn.\u201dWhen Inseop pulled out his wallet from his pocket, Lee Wooyeon burst into laughter.\u201cI\u2019m just joking.\u00a0There is a couple coming in.\u201dInseop showed a more relieved expression when he saw the other person.\u201cAre you afraid I\u2019ll do something strange at the cinema?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cHow do you look at people?\u00a0Oh, it\u2019s starting.\u201dLee Wooyeon leaned against the chair.\u00a0When the lights in the theater went out, Inseop took off the coat he was wearing.\u00a0When he put his clothes on the seat next to him and straightened his head, Inseop stiffened on the spot.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0This movie, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Is it a horror movie?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLee Wooyeon replied refreshingly.\u201cWhy\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Is this?\u201d\u201cI think the time is right and there will be no one there.\u201dIt was a late-night movie, so he booked it and wondered if anyone else would come to see a trashy horror movie.\u00a0Of course, he also thought about whether he should make Choi Inseop suck his dick if no one was there.But above all.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dEven though nothing had come out yet, Inseop was terrified and shuddered.\u00a0On the screen, the character was just walking down the hallway.Lee Wooyeon smiled and ate the popcorn.\u00a0To him, the highlight was not the third-class horror movie.\u00a0Choi Inseop closed his eyes in a panic whenever something appeared on the screen.\u00a0However, as soon as there was a sound, he slowly opened his closed eyes, wondering if it was even more frightening.\u00a0But that didn\u2019t last long.\u201cKyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!\u201dFinally, the first character died.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who did not feel fear in the first place, looked at the screen with a blank face.\u00a0Choi Inseop, who was next to him, had a tired face like a person hanging upside down from a cliff.\u201cIs it scary?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cAh, over there, ghost.\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed his finger at the corner of the screen.\u00a0When something suddenly popped out and attacked the character, Inseop threw the popcorn he was holding and bowed his head to the side.Inseop\u2019s trembling forehead touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smile was lifted.\u00a0He looked down at Inseop.\u00a0Even in the dark theater, he could see Inseop\u2019s big eyes moving slowly.Blood splattered on the screen and screams echoed again.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop buried his head on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder again.\u00a0With the other hand, he even grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm tightly.\u00a0It was something that Inseop would never do.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon wiped Inseop\u2019s cheek with his finger.Inseop, who was trembling with fear, was even more frightened and screamed at his sudden hand.\u00a0The couples sitting in the corner were already entangled like one body, so they didn\u2019t even pay attention to them.\u201cIs it scary?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon asked, this time Inseop immediately nodded.\u00a0With eyes that look like they were about to cry.On Inseop\u2019s clothes, the popcorn he threw in surprise was scattered.\u00a0Inseop, who usually pretended to be an adult, threw that image away altogether.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop looked at the screen again and buried his head.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s head with his hand.\u00a0Soft.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s hair and the skin on the back of his neck.\u201cCan I hold your hand?\u201dLee Wooyeon held out his hand.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dMeanwhile, Inseop hesitated for a moment.\u00a0But in the next scene, when a ghost came out and dragged the woman\u2019s leg down the stairs, Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon swallowed a laugh at the quick change.Inseop\u2019s hands were all wet with sweat.\u00a0Whenever a scary scene appeared, Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand as hard as he could.It was an insignificant force.\u00a0When he clung to him with that, it felt strangely good.\u00a0It would be okay if he grabbed it a little harder.Lee Wooyeon leaned on the chair and turned his head to look at Inseop.\u00a0A faint light from the screen followed Inseop\u2019s face line, creating a dim figure.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s gaze moved along the faint light.His gaze stopped at the small lips.\u00a0Feeling thirsty, Lee Wooyeon picked up a Coke.\u00a0Even though he put ice in his mouth and bit it, the thirst that tightened in his throat did not go away.\u00a0Choi Inseop gasped and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0If left as he was, he was going to hang around the neck.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0It\u2019s just a movie.\u201dLee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s back and said.\u00a0Inseop gave strength to the hand that was holding Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Each time the power to hold him back increased, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s laughter grew stronger.Throughout the movie, Inseop stayed close to Lee Wooyeon and held his hand.\u00a0The content of the movie was pathetic enough to bring tears to his eyes, but Lee Wooyeon had a very satisfying time.The ending credits went up and the last OST of the movie came out.\u00a0In the meantime, Choi Inseop was exhausted like a person who swam alone in the Pacific Ocean.\u00a0The couple, who had been clinging to each other throughout the entire movie in front of them, went out before the lights were turned on.\u201cHow was it?\u00a0Was it fun?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Do you like this\u2026 I did not know.\u201dLee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop\u2019s hand holding him and smiled lightly.\u201cI know, right.\u00a0I didn\u2019t even know I had this kind of taste.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I see.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t be truly angry with the person who paid and showed him the movie, and he didn\u2019t have the strength left to do so.\u00a0His head was dizzy, his stomach was pounding, his hands were sweating\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dInseop was surprised to find that he was holding Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand and shook it off.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I\u2019m out of my mind\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I guess I\u2019m going crazy.\u201dAs Inseop\u2019s hand fell off, the warmth quickly cooled.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at his hand for a moment and then nodded to Inseop to leave.Choi Inseop picked up the robe that was hanging on the seat next to him.\u00a0As he was about to stand up, he grabbed the handle of the theater chair and fell back down.\u00a0The whole time he was watching the movie, he was giving his body strength, so his strength was gone.\u201cWant to see it one more time?\u00a0After this, it won\u2019t be showing any more.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIs it because your legs are getting weak?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon reached out to Inseop.\u201cI\u2019ll hold you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u00a0Wait a minute, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dHe was going to tell him that he\u2019ll be fine if he waited a minute.\u00a0If Lee Wooyeon hadn\u2019t snatched his hand.Before, he caught anything because he didn\u2019t want to die in a crazy state but it was completely different now.\u00a0It felt like his hand was on fire.\u00a0Choi Inseop, led by Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand, went down the stairs of the theater, and was confused and did not know what to do.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u00a0It\u2019s fine now.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u00a0If I let go now, even if you ask me to hold you next time, I won\u2019t hold you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201dInseop thought that if Lee Wooyeon asked to go see a movie, he would refuse for whatever reason in the future.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said yes then, and gently let go of his hand.\u00a0When the two came out of the theater, part-timers who had heard the news flocked to them.\u201cCan\u2019t you sign it?\u201d\u201cPlease let\u2019s take one picture together.\u201dIt was the women who spoke to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Inseop took a step back from Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Usually, he took on the role of stopping the fans from rushing towards Lee Wooyeon, but in this case, it was better to let Lee Wooyeon do what he did.\u201cI\u2019ll sign it for you.\u201dLee Wooyeon took the pen and signed it.\u00a0If nothing else was done, he would rather sign autographs.\u201cCan\u2019t we take a picture together?\u201dIn this case, Inseop had to step in.\u00a0He apologized to the crowd of part-timers, apologized, and said that he had to stop.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I\u2019ll see you again next time I have a chance.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon said goodbye, the female part-timers with regretful faces said, \u201cI\u2019m your fan, I\u2019ll support you, I love you,\u201d etc.Because it was late, there were no people in the passage leading out.\u00a0Inseop followed Lee Wooyeon one step behind.\u201cCome over here.\u201dLee Wooyeon pauses for a moment.\u00a0Inseop paused, then went and stood next to him.\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know why they want autographs.\u00a0What good is that?\u201d\u201cJust, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s precious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cReally?\u00a0Inseop, would you like me to sign it too?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed.\u00a0Today, the sound of his laughter flowed lightly.\u00a0It sounded like a small pebble rolling against water.\u00a0It was a nice laugh.Inseop didn\u2019t want to be caught thinking of such a thing, so he walked with his head down.While walking near the entrance, an ominous sound was heard.\u00a0Inseop frowned and said, \u201cNo way.\u201d\u00a0Really, it was raining.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0The weather forecast didn\u2019t say anything like this\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThey had to walk because he had the car parked in a nearby street parking lot, but it rained.\u00a0Inseop said while looking around,\u201cI\u2019ll go to a convenience store and buy an umbrella\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon took off the jacket he was wearing and put it over one shoulder.\u00a0He grabbed the jacket with the other hand and lifted it up.\u00a0He knew what his gesture meant, but Inseop could not walk under it.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0just I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop and put his hand on his shoulder.\u201cCan you run?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026A\u00a0little.\u201dAs soon as he heard Inseop\u2019s answer, Lee Wooyeon grabbed his shoulder and started running.\u00a0The still cold rain hit my face.\u00a0However, Inseop was focused on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand touching his shoulder, and didn\u2019t even pay attention to the rain.It took them less than 5 minutes to run to where he parked the car.\u00a0But to Inseop, those five minutes felt like five years.\u00a0As if the hair stood all at once on the shoulder that Lee Wooyeon touched, the senses became more sensitive.\u00a0His shoulder was tingling.\u00a0It was also hot.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t look at the face of Lee Wooyeon next to hime.\u00a0He just wanted to get out of his range quickly.When he arrived in front of the car, Inseop got out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand and sighed in relief.\u00a0But it didn;t take long for that sigh to turn into shock.\u201cuh\u2013!\u201dChoi Inseop opened his big eyes and placed his hand on the car\u2019s bonnet.\u00a0It was the same when he bowed his back and checked.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0The wheels are\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, they have a puncture.\u201d\u201cI can see that.\u201dLee Wooyeon put on the clothes and answered as if it was not a big deal.\u00a0Inseop looked at the car, wiping the rainwater flowing over his eyes with his palm.\u00a0The front bumper, which was fine when he parked it, was dented because someone had hit it with a stone.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I think we should report it.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dLee Wooyeon opened the car door and said.\u00a0He sat in the driver\u2019s seat.\u00a0Inseop walked to the other side and sat in the passenger seat.As he closed the car door and went inside, the sound of rain falling outside was heard.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took out a tissue from the glove box and handed it to Inseop.\u00a0Even while wiping off the water, Inseop was worried about the crazy person who punctured all the wheels of the car and left.\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to report it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been in and out of the police station a lot lately.\u00a0This year, we have filled all the quota.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen often, but it\u2019s not unheard of.\u00a0I reported it to the police once in the past and passed it over, but in the end, she was released after paying a fine based on the fucking logic that she did it because she liked me so much.\u201dLee Wooyeon took off his hat and threw it behind him.\u00a0He turned his head to Inseop, scattering his slightly pressed hair with his hands.\u201cChoi Inseop, please say something as a stalker representative. Why do you doing this crazy thing.\u201dNearby cars were fine.\u00a0In the end, it meant that it was the work of someone who knew it was Lee Wooyeon\u2019s car.\u00a0Inseop licked his lips, feeling a bit pricked, and muttered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d without realizing it.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0Inseob didn\u2019t even do it. Why are you sorry?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because the car can be fixed.\u00a0I am a hundred times more displeased with someone pulling my clothes or running into me to hug me.\u201dLee Wooyeon was exceptionally cold-hearted towards the extreme fans who threw their bodies at him.\u00a0Fans knew that fact to some extent, so there was talk of keeping their good lines, but the stalkers eventually acted as he liked it.Lee Wooyeon took off his glasses, put them in the case, and threw them in the back seat.\u00a0Inseop, who sat in the passenger seat, did not know where to look in the awkward atmosphere, so he wiggled his fingers quietly.\u00a0If he was in the driver\u2019s seat, he would be holding the steering wheel.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It\u2019s been a while since he rode in the front passenger seat, so he didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201cI will call a taxi.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Could you lend me your cell phone?\u201dInseop\u2019s cell phone was managed by Lee Wooyeon, so he almost always left it at home unless he was working like today.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon shook his head.\u201cMy phone battery is dead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe took his phone out of his pocket and showed him the power out screen.\u00a0Inseop exhaled a desperate sigh.\u201cHow many spare tires do you have?\u201d\u201cOne.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop, who was worried, opened the door of the passenger seat and tried to get out.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon reached out and closed the door at the same time as the door opened.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cI will go out and call a taxi.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go out when the rain stops.\u00a0There is nothing urgent right now.\u201dLee Wooyeon was right.\u00a0There was nothing urgent right now.\u00a0It was just that his heart was in a hurry.Inseop leaned back on the passenger seat again.\u201cAren\u2019t you taking off your clothes?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cIt got wet.\u201dIt was no big deal.\u00a0Still, Inseop was embarrassed for nothing, and blood rushed to his face.\u00a0He took off the coat he was wearing and left it open in the back seat.\u00a0After finishing all the to-dos, there was another awkward silence.He felt like he had to say something\u00a0\u2026\u00a0What should he say?While Inseop was struggling while looking out the window, Lee Wooyeon suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cI think Choi Inseop is a very unlucky person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes?\u201dNot knowing whether being unlucky simply meant bad luck or a sign of dislike for the other person, Inseop blinked his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s our first date, but the car has a puncture and we\u2019re doing this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0was it\u2026\u00a0\u2026a\u00a0date?\u201d\u201cOf course it is.\u00a0Did you think it was a reward for a manager who worked hard?\u201dOf course, he thought it was a little odd.\u00a0This was because right after he said that he would go to the cinema if he had a lover, Lee Wooyeon suddenly said that he would like to go see a movie next time.\u00a0However, since he was such a person who could not be figured out, Inseop quickly erased the thoughts that came to his mind.\u00a0More than anything else, he had always made up his mind that he would not have even the slightest expectation of Lee Wooyeon.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Now that you know, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThe air became even more thick.\u00a0Inseop was fiddling with his nails, thinking about which part of the day could be called a date.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0none.\u00a0There wasn\u2019t a single one.Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting next to him, burst into laughter.\u00a0Only then did Inseop realize that he had been teased again and blushed.\u201cYou wanted to go on a date with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do it next time.\u00a0A proper date.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I will decline.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say no. I\u2019ll do it if you want to.\u201dFor some reason, it felt good saying that.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rolled the seat back and laid down on it.\u00a0He motioned for Inseop to lie down too.\u201cI\u2019ll just sit\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon tilted the passenger seat back.\u00a0Inseop sighed and lay down.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice sight to see because of a crazy stalker bitch.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cHow is it?\u00a0It\u2019s like lying with me and watching the rain fall through the sunroof.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u201dAgain the conversation was cut off.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t seem to care much, but Inseop\u2019s mouth was dry because of the awkwardness.He had to talk about something\u00a0anything, anything\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.The same thought ran through his mind.\u00a0Choi Inseop suddenly remembered the words he had exchanged at the drinking party that day.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0What do you do with that letter?\u201d\u201cWha letter?\u201d\u201cThe letter you get once a month.\u201d\u201cPostcard?\u00a0I burn it.\u00a0I even tear it apart.\u201dLee Wooyeon answered very neatly.\u00a0Inseop let out a sigh as well.\u201cWhy? If it was Inseop who sends that postcard\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0did you sent it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDid Inseop really send it?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t write it, but \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I sent it.\u201dHe picked the content from Jennie\u2019s diary, but it was written by Inseop, so what he sent was correct.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon let out a low laugh.\u201cYou were a real stalker.\u00a0Choi Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It\u2019s not that I wrote it, but\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s how it happened.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Does that mean that friend wrote it?\u00a0Jennie?\u201dWhen the name Jennie came out of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth, she felt strange.\u00a0Inseop nodded his head slightly.\u201cWriting a letter on behalf of a dead person.\u00a0Don\u2019t you feel bad?\u201d\u201cNo, I never thought of that\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe has never done it.\u00a0As he read Jennie\u2019s diary, he felt sorry, regret, and guilt.\u00a0The thought of not being by her side until the very end, who was her best friend, tormented him the whole time.\u201cI want to do anything.\u00a0Anything I can do\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop believed that it was the only way he could atone for Jennie.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon turned his head toward Inseop.\u00a0His cold eyes narrowed slightly in the dark.\u201cWhy do you live like that?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhy are you living like that?\u00a0Does that mean that the dead will come back alive?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop\u2019s heart fluttered as Lee Wooyeon went through his wounds with a casual voice.\u00a0The fact that nothing like this would change anything, he knew better than anyone.\u00a0However, he could not sit still in the pit of despair and sorrow.\u201cActually, her death is just an excuse for you, and you\u2019re just doing what you want to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cYou follow me because you want to, and you like me.\u00a0Isn\u2019t it?\u201dWhen Inseop, whose face was red, tried to get up from the seat, Lee Wooyeon reached out and forced him to lie down.\u00a0Then he pulled the seat belt and fastened it to prevent him from getting up.Choi Inseop covered his face with his forearm and turned around.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon knew that he had pierced Inseop\u2019s deepest wounds.\u00a0Choi Inseop did not criticize anyone.\u00a0He was just constantly hurting and driving himself.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t like it very much.\u201cSorry.\u00a0That was harsh.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt feels like a fucking shame to be involved with me because of a woman whose face I don\u2019t even know.\u201dHe wanted to uproot the existence of the woman named Jennie, who was deeply embedded in Choi Inseop\u2019s life, as much as possible.\u00a0It also hurt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s feelings to know that he would do anything for the woman instead of him.\u201cIt\u2019s just because you like me, you love me like crazy, so let\u2019s just say that.\u201dLee Wooyeon said.\u00a0Inseop could see that this was his own consolation.\u201cLike that\u2026\u00a0 I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, it\u2019s true.\u00a0Because Choi Inseop likes me.\u201dInseop\u2019s face heated up again. His heart tightened because he was afraid that Lee Wooyeon would start to say that mischievous thing.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon looked up at the sunroof of the car that was pouring rain without saying anything.\u00a0That was it.\u00a0The sound of raindrops hitting the roof of the car gradually piled up between them.\u00a0Little by little, the sounds washed away the things that were not the present two.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked carefully at the face of Lee Wooyeon, who was lying next to him.\u00a0When their eyes met, Lee Wooyeon smiled softly.\u00a0In the sound of rain, Lee Wooyeon laughed like that.For the first time, Inseop felt comfortable next to Lee Wooyeon.The pouring rain ran down the roof of the car.\u00a0Inseop thought that the rain would not stop for a while, but he did not tell Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was there, too, with his mouth shut.\u00a0The cell phone in his pocket was simply turned on.It was around 3:00 in the morning when the rain stopped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

the front door, Inseop frowned when he saw that his socks got soaked in the rain and messed up.\u00a0Seeing this, Lee Wooyeon held him and lifted him up.\u201cI\u2019ll, I\u2019ll just\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cAre you going to come into my house with those dirty feet?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cStay still.\u201dLee Wooyeon dropped Inseop down in the bathroom.\u00a0As Inseop stood there without taking off his clothes, Lee Wooyeon unbuttoned his shirt and asked.\u201cWould you like to take a shower together?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0no.\u00a0no.\u00a0I will do it alone.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0I\u2019ll take a shower and come out.\u201dAfter the bathroom door closed, Inseop took off the clothes he was wearing.\u00a0Eventually, after waiting for the rain to stop, he went to a nearby convenience store and called the insurance company.\u00a0After towing the car, the two returned by taxi.He checked the clock in the bathroom and it was four in the morning.\u00a0Fortunately, there was only a schedule for tomorrow afternoon.\u00a0That didn\u2019t mean he would oversleep, but the pressure was completely different from having a schedule early in the morning.Who the hell did that to the car anyway?\u00a0Today, he didn\u2019t have a public schedule, it was a private one, but they still followed him and destroyed the car.In fact, before becoming Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, Choi Inseop only went to ruin his car once for revenge.\u00a0In his head, he imagined a scene where he would make the car tattered, but in the end, all Inseop did was create a small 2cm blemish on the bumper of the car.Judging from the fact that they did such a big damage, it was definitely not an ordinary stalker.Inseop finished showering, contemplating whether he should talk to CEO Kim or manager Cha.\u00a0When he changed clothes and went out to the living room, Lee Wooyeon was reading a book.\u201cAren\u2019t you sleeping?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go to sleep\u00a0now.\u201dHe closed the book he was reading and stood up.\u00a0He had a weird thought.\u00a0He wondered if Lee Wooyeon waited until he came out after taking a shower.No way.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It can\u2019t be.Inseop shook his head and followed him into the room.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked as if surprised when he took out the blanket and saw Inseop laying under the bed.\u201cAren\u2019t you sleeping on the bed today?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou must have forgotten what comes out from under the bed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop\u2019s face hardened when the ghost that had crawled out of the bed and grabbed the main character\u2019s hair and dragged him along came to mind.\u201cWould you like to sleep with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Only for today\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOnce you come up, you can\u2019t go down, so think about it.\u201dNot sure if it was a joke or not, Inseop pondered for a long time before deciding to lie down.\u201cIf something comes out from under the bed, tell me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0A movie is just a movie.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dLee Wooyeon said goodnight, turning off the lights in the bedroom.\u00a0Inseop could not sleep easily because of what Lee Wooyeon said about something coming out from under the bed.\u00a0He turned his body over.\u00a0Tossed.\u00a0Tossed some more and turned to and fro.Inseop constantly moved his body to get more comfortable on his bed without being scared.\u00a0Suddenly, Lee Wooyeon came down from the bed and grabbed Inseop.\u201cWhat are you doing\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t sleep because I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI was afraid of ghosts, that\u2019s why I said we should sleep together.\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop with one arm and lied so naturally.\u201cI was scared the whole time I was watching the movie.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dWhile watching the horror movie, Inseop went almost completely insane, but in the meantime, Lee Wooyeon looked at the screen without moving and he could not help but admire him.\u00a0He even wondered if that person could not feel fear.\u201cSo Inseop, sleep next to me.\u201dIf he were to be rational, it would be right to push Lee Wooyeon away and sleep below, but Inseop did not want to turn away for today.Inseop said okay in a trembling voice, and laid right down on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and felt his presence lying next to him.\u00a0After tossing and turning a few more times, Inseop found Lee Wooyeon\u2019s sleeping face and took a deep breath.It was a face he had always seen, but seeing it like this, it was very unfamiliar.It was not Lee Wooyeon, the actor everyone loved, nor the football team quarterback Philip, it was just the Lee Wooyeon he knew.Choi Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side face for a long time and then closed his eyes.\u00a0No more scary thoughts.Soon, the sound of breathing in the room subsided.Inseop checked his watch as he ran into the coffee shop.\u00a0There was not much time left for Lee Wooyeon to leave after finishing his workout.\u00a0After talking on the phone with his mother, he got distracted and didn\u2019t notice the time.It wasn\u2019t long after that he found out that Lee Wooyeon liked to have a cup of coffee after working out.\u00a0It was a fact that Inseop found out after listening to the conversation he had with manager Cha and CEO Kim in passing.\u00a0There was no need to show Lee Wooyeon his good side now, but Inseop still bought a coffee just in time for him to finish his workout as he had a habit.\u201cHello.\u201dAs he entered the cafe, a part-timer recognized him and greeted him warmly.\u00a0When he saw the cute girl with short hair, he thought of his younger sister in America, and Inseop always had a smile on his face.\u201cYes.\u00a0Hello.\u00a0excuse me\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cA cup of cold Americano, no syrup, and ground ice.\u00a0Is that right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dInseop sighed in relief as he seemed to have savedeven a little bit of time.\u00a0After paying the bill, he sat down in front of the counter and waited for the coffee he had ordered.\u00a0However, the part-timer came to him with coffee.\u201cThe coffee you ordered.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Thank you.\u201dAfter accepting coffee and politely greeting, he was about to leave, when the part-timer with short hair grabbed the hem of his robe.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cPerhaps, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Are you dating anyone?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0uh.\u201dIt was the first time he was ever asked this from a woman in this way, so Inseop could answer properly and bowed his head in embarrassment.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201d\u201cAh, there is someone you\u2019re dating.\u00a0I\u2019m really sorry. For bothering you.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019m not dating anyone\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThen you don\u2019t like me?\u00a0Ha, that hurts more.\u201dDespite the playful girl\u2019s reaction, Inseop was embarrassed and waved his hand in embarrassment.\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like you.\u00a0It\u2019s just that I\u2019m\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m not the type to bother you. Can you just give me your number?\u201dA short-haired female student scolded Inseop in a charming tone.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know when he would return to the US, but he couldn\u2019t give the girl her contact information.\u00a0However, it was not possible to explain his situation to the other person.\u201cI have some work to do.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dA large hand reached out from behind and snatched the coffee.\u00a0When Inseop turned around in surprise, Lee Wooyeon, who had finished exercising, drank the coffee and raised his eyebrows.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dHe asked again.\u00a0As Choi Inseop couldn\u2019t find any words to say and stood with his eyes closed, the short-haired part-timer next to him screamed and pointed at Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWait, no, really\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?!\u201d\u201cHello.\u201dEven in the dark cafe interior lighting, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face, wearing a hat, lit up.\u00a0As he smiled, revealing his well-groomed teeth, the guests sitting around also turned their heads and looked at him.\u00a0The whispering grew louder.\u201cHey, I\u2019m your fan.\u00a0Please sign an autograph.\u201dThe interest of a part-timer with short hair shifted to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0As it was a natural result, Inseop was neither sad nor bitter.\u201csorry.\u00a0I\u2019m a little late, so I\u2019ll do it next time.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled kindly and beckoned Inseop to leave.\u00a0Inseop bowed his head to the part-timer, and the two left the store.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was following Inseop while drinking coffee, suddenly asked.\u201cDid you give her your number?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t she ask for your phone number?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t give.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed while saying, \u2018Is that so?\u2019\u00a0Inseop realized that he wasn\u2019t genuinely smiling.\u00a0It was only recently that he was able to recognize such subtle differences.\u201cBy the way, Inseop is also very popular.\u00a0It\u2019s the third time I\u2019ve noticed it.\u201d\u201cThree times?\u201dHe swore this was the first time he has had this happen while working as a manager.\u201cOnce in the bathroom, once at the club, once here today.\u201dEvery time Lee Wooyeon counted on his fingers, one at a time and talked, Inseop\u2019s chest felt heavy.\u201cThat\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cYou got attacked too.\u201dInseop, who had been walking before, stood still.\u00a0He met Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes.\u00a0He didn\u2019t smile or show a playful expression like he usually does.\u00a0It didn\u2019t seem like he was joking.\u00a0He felt like he was somehow angry.And maybe he was going to take him somewhere else.\u00a0Where did he park the car\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He had an early schedule tomorrow.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0No.\u00a0Why was he already thinking like that?\u00a0But he was anxious.\u00a0Because every time Lee Wooyeon put on that expression, he always did sexual stuff.Anxious thoughts popped into his mind with each blink of an eye.\u00a0When Inseop\u2019s head was filled with scary thoughts and he couldn\u2019t think of any more, Lee Wooyeon took out a cigarette, put it in his mouth, and lit it.\u00a0Taking a long drag, he made a sharp expression.\u00a0Choi Inseop only watched his actions with an anxious mind.\u00a0After putting the cigarette into the coffee he was drinking, Lee Wooyeon threw the coffee into the trash can with a cool smile.\u201cThe taste of coffee here is not good.\u00a0In the future, go somewhere else.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even take a sip.\u201cLast time you said you liked it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cYour taste can change at any time.\u201dSaying that, Lee Wooyeon looked at Inseop\u2019s face.\u00a0When their eyes met, Lee Wooyeon turned his head with a terrifying expression.In fact, it was this that was depressing.\u00a0It was such great luck to find a coffee shop that suited Lee Wooyeon\u2019s taste near the fitness center.\u00a0But he needed to find a different one again\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0When will he find it again?\u00a0He has a very picky taste, so why did he change it all of a sudden\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201cWhy?\u00a0Do you regret not being able to go to that coffee shop again?\u201dSeeing that Inseop\u2019s expression is not good, Lee Wooyeon asked him.\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m wondering when I will find another place.\u201d\u201cYou can find it anywhere. I\u2019m not going to die if I don\u2019t drink a cup of coffee.\u201dAs he walked to the car, Inseop muttered helplessly.\u00a0He took the car key out of his pocket and was about to open the door when Inseop saw a letter stuck on the windshield of the car.\u201cUh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It looks like a fan letter.\u201d\u201cLeave it.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a fan letter?\u201d\u201cDo you think the bitch who came after me at this hour and left a letter on the windshield would be sane?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s words were true, but he couldn\u2019t leave it in the parking lot, so Inseop put the letter in his pocket.\u201cWhy are you taking it?\u00a0Throw it away.\u201dLee Wooyeon sat in the passenger seat.\u00a0Sometimes he sat in the passenger seat instead of the back seat of the van.\u00a0It was a habit these days.\u00a0Inseop got very anxious and nervous every time, but he did not express it to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI will go home and throw it away.\u201dInseop closed the car door and started the engine.\u00a0Even in the narrow parking lot, the car backed out with perfection.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked Inseop, watching him pull out the car accurately without any errors and going out at once.\u201cWhere did you practice driving a car?\u201d\u201cJust, everywhere\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dEven after getting his license, Inseop paid for driving training whenever he had spare time.\u00a0Because the road laws and systems in the United States and Korea were completely different, he made a lot of effort to get used to the driving culture of Korea.\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything other than that?\u00a0How did you prepare to be a manager?\u201dInseop was bewildered by the sudden interview mode, so he blurted out the end of his speech.\u201cWhat did you learn?\u201d\u201cI learned a little bit about self-defense.\u00a0and, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I was going to learn massage, but I stopped because I thought it would be useless, and \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Why are you laughing?\u201d\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u00a0You really like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dIf Lee Wooyeon was in the back seat, he might be able to hide his blush.\u00a0That\u2019s why he really hated sitting next to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cTell me you like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dIt started again.\u201cThe promised time is almost up.\u00a0In the meantime, don\u2019t you have to work hard to persuade me?\u201dThe time he promised with Lee Wooyeon was less than two weeks away.\u00a0Inseop hesitated for a moment, then opened his mouth.\u201cI like you.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but feel the heat rising in his earlobe, even when he tried to speak bluntly.\u201cHow much do you like me?\u201d\u201cA lot, I like you a lot.\u201d\u201cSo, how much?.\u201d\u201cA lot.\u201d\u201cAs much as the sky and the ground?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Farther than the universe\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dIt was a question and answer like children\u2019s play on words.\u00a0Inseop felt a fever rising in his heart.\u00a0Even knowing that Lee Wooyeon was deliberately asking such questions to embarrass him, it was difficult to respond bluntly.\u201cYou like me so much, so you don\u2019t have to worry about getting on the plane this weekend.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to run away with your passport.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0passport.\u201dHe decided to go to Hawaii for a photo shoot this weekend.\u00a0The manager, Choi Inseop, of course, had to accompany him.\u00a0Inseop remembered his passport and his notebook, which were still in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s safe.\u00a0The photos in it too.\u201cLooking at that expression, I think I\u2019ll have to take it back after you go through immigration procedures.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I will not run away.\u201d\u201cOf course I should.\u201dLee Wooyeon reached out and touched Inseop\u2019s earlobe.\u00a0Inseop, who was surprised, widened his eyes and made a face that said, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cYour earlobes are soft.\u00a0Inseop, like a cock.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cDo you know that Inseop\u2019s penis is really soft?\u00a0Is it because you haven\u2019t masturbated before?\u201dEmbarrassed, Inseop wanted to play something, so he quickly turned on the radio.\u00a0There was no room to take out the CD and put it inside the audio.\u00a0When the advertisement on the radio ended, a familiar voice came out of it.<Simple but beautiful words bloom in our hearts.>It was a public service advertisement narrated by Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0With that beautiful advertisement in the background, Lee Wooyeon smiled and spit out great words.\u201cChoi Inseop\u2019s penis is too soft to be used on a woman.\u00a0So you have no choice but to stick with me.\u201d<Practice it.\u00a0Words that make you and your surroundings beautiful.>\u201cYou thought of it, right?\u00a0Didn\u2019t you suddenly have the thought of wanting put it in?\u201dA public service advertisement that overlaps with Lee Wooyeon\u2019s vulgar words broke Inseop\u2019s heart.\u00a0Holding the steering wheel, he wanted to stop crying.\u00a0Choi Inseop turned off the radio and quietly shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t think that.\u201d\u201cEven if you don\u2019t think of it now, once you put it in, you will change your mind.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0I\u2019ll just put it in you.\u201d\u201cAh, what\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dAt that time, a taxi from the next lane suddenly cut in and made a sudden stop.\u00a0Inseop hurriedly stepped on the brake, but the front bumper of the van hit the rear bumper of the taxi.Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s shoulder with his hand and supported his body.\u201cAre you hurt?\u201dInseop looked at Lee Wooyeon first and asked.\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u2013.\u201dLee Wooyeon looked at the taxi that suddenly interrupted.\u00a0Choi Inseop said firmly as he unfastened his seat belt.\u201cDon\u2019t get out of the car.\u00a0I will take care of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come out no matter what.\u201dJudging from the sudden interruption and the sudden stop, it was clear that he did it on purpose.\u00a0There were quite a few people in various places who fought with the celebrities who did not want to make a big problem.\u00a0Choi Inseop knew about this part, but he had heard the words from Manager Cha.\u00a0He repeatedly urged him not to get Lee Wooyeon into an argument no matter what, that it would be good for him, for Lee Woo-yeon, and for the peace of the other person and the country.\u201cI will take care of everything.\u201dSaying that, Choi Inseop went out of the van.\u00a0As soon as he came out, the taxi driver grabbed his neck and pulled him out of the car.\u201cWhy the fuck are you driving like that?\u00a0You brat!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Are you okay?\u201d\u201cDamn, do I look okay in your eyes?\u00a0Oh my, my throat hurts.\u201d\u201cOnce you go to the hospital, get a detailed examination, and then contact the insurance company\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dWhen Inseop tried to get the insurance company\u2019s phone number and his business card out of his wallet, the taxi driver shouted with fire in his eyes.\u201cA detailed examination?\u00a0Now, are you saying I\u2019m scamming you to get your money?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I don\u2019t mean that\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cYou hit my car from behind. You\u2019re the reason why I have to fix my car and work on it all day. How am you going to compensate for the damage?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to make that clear with the insurance company\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThe taxi driver grabbed Inseop by the neck.\u201cHey.\u00a0Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re going to be a great person just because you drive an expensive car?\u00a0Fuck it. Isn\u2019t that a celebrity car?\u00a0Damn it, if you hit a car from behind, you\u2019re not a celebrity but a jerk, and you think you don\u2019t have to come out and apologize!?\u201d\u201cI made a mistake because I didn\u2019t check the front very well.\u00a0It\u2019s all my mistake.\u00a0Sorry.\u00a0The compensation is after I tell the company\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThe man slammed Inseop\u2019s head with his palm.\u201cIsn\u2019t that what everyone says?\u00a0Whether you\u2019re a celebrity or not, you should come out and apologize\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dThe sound of the passenger door closing hard was heard.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was standing where Inseop looked with a pale face.\u00a0He walked in front of the taxi driver with bloody momentum, without showing his usual smiling face or polite attitude.\u201cUh, what is this?\u00a0He is a person who appears on TV a lot.\u201dThe taxi driver\u2019s eyes lit up.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u00a0He was caught.\u00a0With that expression on his face, he started arguing again.\u201cGosh, I\u2019m living my life on a daily wage, but if I\u2019m suddenly hit on the back like this, how can I pay for the hospital fee and the private payment? Until I get the money from the insurance company, how can I\u2026\u2026.\u201dWithout saying anything, Lee Wooyeon removed the taxi driver\u2019s hand, which was holding Inseop\u2019s collar. As the rough hand was held, the taxi driver bent down with a tremendous scream. It was a reaction mixed with exaggeration, but Inseop, who knew how strong Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand was, looked worried.\u201cAh, Celebrities are hitting people!\u201d\u201cDriver, don\u2019t do this. When did Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cShould I really hit you?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and asked softly.\u00a0At the unexpected reaction, the taxi driver raised his head with a puzzled face.\u201cIf you need insurance, I can help.\u201dA red danger signal lit up in Choi Inseop\u2019s mind.\u00a0He realized that Lee Wooyeon, who was smiling, wasn\u2019t really smiling.\u201cMr. Driver.\u00a0Sorry.\u00a0Here is my business card.\u00a0If you contact us here, we will calculate and send you the hospital bills, repair costs, and today\u2019s daily wages as soon as possible.\u201dInseop quickly intervened, but the taxi driver\u2019s attention was already on Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWhat?\u00a0What did you say now?\u00a0This Celebrity.\u201d\u201cI said I would help.\u201dInseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.No.\u00a0Don\u2019t do it, please.Lee Wooyeon could read the words in Inseop\u2019s eyes clearly.\u00a0He said to the taxi driver with a hint of a smile on his lips.\u201cIt must be difficult.\u00a0You wouldn\u2019t get much compensation for such a simple contact accident.\u201dInseop, who knew Lee Wooyeon\u2019s nature, read every word he spoke, and the malice hidden in each word made his spine chill.\u201cI, I\u2019m not doing this for compensation, but as a human being, as a human being, once an accident occurs\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon took out a business card from his wallet and held it out.\u201cContact us here.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIf you contact me here, I will take care of everything today.\u00a0So as not to offend you.\u201dThe last words sounded very meaningful to Inseop.\u00a0He wanted to snatch the business card from the taxi driver and exchange it for the insurance business card he had.\u00a0However, the taxi driver, who did not know Lee Wooyeon\u2019s true intentions, opened his mouth wide and put his business card in his pocket.\u201cThen I will go.\u00a0Here\u2019s my business card\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand.\u00a0The taxi driver, thinking he had received a golden ticket, went into the taxi without looking back.\u00a0The two got back into the van.\u00a0As he started the car again, Inseop said to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI was going to give him my business card, but why did you do that?\u00a0And whose business card did you give?\u201d\u201cA lawyer.\u00a0There\u2019s a black box in this car, so I\u2019m going to tear it apart and send it to him.\u00a0Is that okay?\u201d\u201cWhy did you come?\u00a0I clearly told you not to come out\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cSince when was Choi Inseop in a position to give me orders?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tone was sharp, but Inseop suppressed the rising fear and answered calmly.\u201cAnyway, this is a matter for me to deal with.\u00a0A person who drove like that on purpose to get into an argument.\u00a0Don\u2019t you know that coming out will cause problems?\u201d\u201cOf course I knew.\u201dLee Wooyeon leaned against the window and looked at Inseop and smiled.\u00a0Inseop didn\u2019t feel like joking around at all.\u201cIt was also my negligence.\u00a0I should have checked the front.\u00a0Just this problem\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u00a0So, are you saying that Inseop can be grabbed by the collar and hit in the head by that bastard?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my job.\u201dInseop spoke quietly.\u201cAs a manager, it\u2019s unavoidable.\u00a0So, if something like this happens in the future, then\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cokay.\u00a0This is unavoidable, so go out and get grabbed by the neck.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s hand swiped Inseop\u2019s neck.\u00a0And then a harsh word was added.\u201cThen I\u2019ll have no choice but to break that bastard\u2019s wrist.\u201d\u201cMr. Lee Wooyeon!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unavoidable.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that.\u00a0Everyone knows Lee Wooyeon, but if you act like that\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWhat if I act like that?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked with a smile.\u00a0But, noticing that his eyes were cold, Inseop answered with a trembling voice.\u201cThen, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0You can\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Didn\u2019t Inseop start the manager job to find out my weakness anyway?\u00a0That\u2019s good. If you want to mess with my personality, you should get caught and beaten by people in front of me. Then, what Inseop wants. I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d\u201cI hope you don\u2019t do that because of me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBecause of me, that\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, I wish you didn\u2019t do that.\u00a0I don\u2019t want it.\u201dHe was afraid of Lee Wooyeon revealing his true nature in front of other people, but if the reason was him\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he won\u2019t be able to stand it.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want that.Lee Wooyeon looked at Inseop\u2019s side profile.\u00a0It was an obsessive gaze.\u00a0He glared at Inseop with fierce eyes, as if trying to pull out Inseop\u2019s suppressed true feelings by grabbing his head.\u201cIf it\u2019s because of you, you don\u2019t want it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0What Choi Inseop wanted was something else.\u00a0I forgot\u00a0Inseop just wants to spread his legs and get fucked by me.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I was being insensitive.\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, that\u2019s not\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop couldn\u2019t speak properly while looking at Lee Wooyeon because he was driving.\u201cWhat else do you want?\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u00a0You wanted to suck my dick.\u00a0At first, you trembled like you don\u2019t like it, but in the end you ate it very greedily.\u00a0Whether it\u2019s from the bottom or the top, you ate it so deliciously that I\u2019m having trouble deciding where to put it every time.\u201dLeaning against the window, with his eyes wide open, Lee Wooyeon continued speaking carelessly.\u201cWhere should I put it today?\u00a0Where would you like it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cCan I put it in you here right now?\u00a0Are you talking to me like that because you want to do it here in the driver seat in front of people?\u201dChoi Inseop became contemplative and grabbed the steering wheel.\u00a0They were not in the back seat, and it was clearly visible to people if they do it here right now.\u00a0He absolutely wanted to avoid it somehow.\u201cNo.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cThen I will do whatever Choi Inseop wants.\u00a0Inseop is a good manager.\u00a0You can\u2019t help but get hit by a son of a bitch and can\u2019t even clean up because of me, so I\u2019ll do whatever you want. Please tell me.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s finger stroked Inseop\u2019s chin.\u00a0Subtle heat was spread by his hands, which were stroking his lips and earlobes, cheeks and eye.\u00a0Inseop bit his trembling lips.\u201cAt\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, At home\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cAt home?\u00a0And?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0If you do\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I will.\u201d\u201cI can not hear you well.\u00a0Mr Inseop.\u00a0Please tell me clearly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0At home, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0If you do, it would be nice.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201dInseop knew that Lee Wooyeon would persistently ask until a specific word came out.\u00a0Cold sweat dripped from his hands and he felt dizzy.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand was gradually moving downwards.\u00a0Relentlessly caressing the raised bumps near his chest over his clothes, he hastened Inseop\u2019s answer.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0with me, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I want you to have sex with me.\u201dIn the end, words of surrender came out of Choi Inseop\u2019s mouth like a sigh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

off at the entrance.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon pulled down Inseop\u2019s underwear and pants without hesitation.\u201cI was on the brink of bursting from the elevator.\u201dLee Wooyeon undid his belt as he said that.\u201cBecause I was thinking of putting the tip of my cock in Mr. Inseop\u2019s delicious hole, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Fuck, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2015\u2015, relax.\u201dThe cock that entered without any preparation ripped Inseop\u2019s body.\u00a0Inseop was pushed against the wall without a moment for him to make a sound.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon lifted Inseop\u2019s leg from behind and moved his waist a few more times to insert it roughly.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u00a0\u2015\u2015!\u201dIt felt like fireworks were going off in front of him.\u00a0Inseop put his forehead on the cold marble wall and gasped for breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop from behind and whispered, almost like a sigh.\u201cDid you want this?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Ugh\u2026 Ha, I, Wai, wait\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want anything else, so can I just put it in Mr. Inseop\u2019s hole and cum?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ah, I, Woo, Woo\u2026\u00a0yeon, it\u2019s tearing\u2026\u00a0It\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ah, it hurts\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s hand slid down and grabbed Inseop\u2019s dick in his hand.\u00a0When he applied force to the palm of his hand, Inseop screamed.\u201cWith a cock like this, you won\u2019t be okay with just anyone, Lee Dayoung, Kim Haeshin, Yoon Ahreum, the part-timer from the coffee house, no one, fuck, understand?\u201dThe faint names flashed past his memory.\u00a0Not knowing what he meant, Inseop shed tears and nodded his head.Lee Wooyeon pulled his back as far back as possible and thrusted hard.\u00a0When Inseop shuddered and tried to sit down, Lee Wooyeon made Inseop\u2019s thighs draped over his body.\u201cI\u2019m the only one who puts it in your asshole.\u00a0Other cocks should not be accepted.\u201d\u201cAh, I got\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0,slow, slowly\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019ll tear\u2026\u00a0ugh\u201dLee Wooyeon brought Inseop\u2019s hand behind him and spread his fingers on his hole.\u201cInseop\u2019s hole that takes me in, can you feel it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Ah, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Huh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t break.\u00a0As if it\u2019s so delicious you were tightening it\u2013\u201d\u201cAh, uh, \u2015\u2015Ah-ah-, Woo, yeon, you, it hurts so much\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dAs Inseop was crying and panting, Lee Wooyeon cursed and laid him down on the floor.\u00a0He grabbed Inseop\u2019s pants and underwear that were hanging between his legs, pulled them off completely, and sat down between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u201cWha, what are you doing\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cStay still.\u201dLee Wooyeon buried his head between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Inseop was startled and sat up like back was on fire.\u201cOh, no\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ah, no\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u00a0I sucked it only once and you\u2019re already dripping from the tip.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled as he stroked Inseop\u2019s genitals with his fingertips, which began to move faster.\u00a0Inseop shook his head.\u201cAh, don\u2019t do it.\u00a0Something like that, ha\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u00a0Is there any reason why I shouldn\u2019t suck Choi Inseop\u2019s cock?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cInseop sucks my cock so deliciously so I\u2019m tasting it once.\u00a0So shut up and lie down.\u201dLee Wooyeon forced Inseop to lie down and put it in his mouth again.\u00a0Choi Inseop covered his face with both hands.\u00a0He felt like he was going to die.\u00a0It was so shameful and it was hard to breathe with so much pleasure.The genital inside Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth got harder and harder.\u00a0Just by licking it with his tongue a few times, a sob came out of Inseop.\u201cAh, uh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, uh, ah\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, not\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ugh!\u00a0Ah\u2026\u201dThe sound of him crying was so mouth-watering and it even made Lee Wooyeon think that the man\u2019s cock he had sucked for the first time was sweet.\u201cAh, no\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, I\u2019m, I\u2019m\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop struggled to push Lee Wooyeon\u2019s head away.\u00a0Far from stopping, Lee Wooyeon sucked Inseop even harder.\u201cAh, Wait, wait\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2015\u2015!\u201dInseop widened his eyes and grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hair with his hands.\u00a0His back trembled.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon spit out Inseop\u2019s semen and got up.\u00a0Realizing what had happened, Inseop could not speak, he was dazed, and then began to cry.Lee Wooyeon swallowed a laugh as if it was absurd and asked.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe person you like sucked your cock, so you cry because you\u2019re moved?\u201d\u201cNo, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop covered his face with his hands.No matter how much he hates him, says he must hate Lee Wooyeon, or that he will take revenge for Jennie, in the end, it is his own decision to be around this man.\u00a0He loved him so much, he love him so much\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop was terrified because he thought that his heart would be revealed to Lee Wooyeon.Lee Wooyeon stroked Inseop\u2019s hair with his hand.\u00a0How can a person whose heart was so inhumane have such soft and affectionate hands?\u201cYou cry no matter what I do. I always make you cry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cBut seeing Inseop crying makes my dick hard, fuck, I\u2019m a real bastard.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled faintly and made Inseop lift his chin.\u00a0He opened his mouth with his fingers and grabbed Inseop\u2019s hair with the other hand.\u00a0Inseop, who knew what that meant, looked up at Lee Wooyeon, his eyes wet with tears.\u201cSuck it.\u00a0I\u2019ll put it inside.\u201dInseop, who was crying, slowly opened his lips.\u00a0As Lee Wooyeon taught, he lowered his tongue and swallowed all of the man\u2019s genitals.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s palms wrapped around Inseop\u2019s cheeks.\u00a0As Inseop carefully moved his tongue, a moan erupted from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth like a sigh.\u201cIs it delicious?\u00a0Just nod your head.\u201dInseop couldn\u2019t help but nod his head.\u00a0Perhaps he liked the answer, and Lee Wooyeon\u2019s got even bigger and harder.\u00a0When the tip of his penis touched the deepest part of his throat, Inseop frowned slightly and tried to pull his head back.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon held him tightly between his legs to prevent Inseop from moving.\u201cMore than any other woman I\u2019ve ever done, Inseop sucks my cock as if it was the most delicious.\u00a0Do you like it that much?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s fingers ran through Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0The heat of his fingers swept down his head and parts of his face, as if urging him to answer.\u201cNod your head when I ask,\u00a0Mr. Inseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon said while fiddling with Inseop\u2019s earlobe.\u00a0Inseop, who had licked his lips cautiously and timidly, made a frightened face and nodded.\u201cDo you want my dick to break your hole?\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dWhen he tried to shake his head, Lee Wooyeon grabbed his ear and held it so that he could not move.\u201cQuickly nod your head.\u00a0You\u2019re licking my dick right now, are you thinking that you want me to put it in right now?\u201dThere was only one option.\u00a0Inseop nodded slightly, and Lee Wooyeon laughed.\u201cThen lick it and make it more wet.\u00a0If you get it wet, I\u2019ll cum a lot inside Inseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s hand grabbed Inseop\u2019s head.\u00a0When he grabbed his head and started moving his waist, Inseop felt like a fire was burning inside his mouth.\u00a0He wanted to tell him to slow down a little bit, but the dick that went in and out without a break blocked Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u201cYou have an innocent face, but when you do that, you drive people crazy.\u201dWondering if he had made a mistake again, Inseop raised his eyes and looked at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face.\u00a0The moment their eyes met, Lee Wooyeon pulled out from Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u201cAre you impatient?\u201dLee Wooyeon placed Choi Inseop\u2019s ankles on his shoulders and lifted his hips.\u00a0He thrusted it at once.\u00a0As Inseop groaned and tried to get up, Lee Wooyeon pressed his hand on his stomach.\u201cYou can\u2019t stand it, you ask me to put it in, that\u2019s how you\u2019re begging me.\u201d\u201cThat, no\u2013, ah\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Ugh.\u201dHe was deeper than before because his legs were up.\u00a0The tip of the cock that was pushed in tight was hot.\u00a0Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm, sobbed and let out a hot breath.\u201cAh, ha\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ah, ugh\u2026ugh\u2026haa!\u201dEvery time Lee Wooyeon moved his waist, Inseop\u2019s body shook.\u00a0Unable to overcome the extreme sensation, Inseop\u2019s lips were wide open.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pressed Inseop\u2019s waist with his hand and thrusted inside several times.\u201cYou like,\u2015\u2015me.\u201d\u201cAh, uh, ha, , \u2015\u2015!\u201d\u201cWith my dick inside, say you like me!\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice vibrated through Inseop\u2019s body.\u00a0Inseop licked his lips, which were not moving well, and said in a voice mixed with a sob.\u201cI like, Haa\u2014you.\u00a0I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Uhh, Wooyeon.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI like you,\u201d Inseop muttered as he exhaled.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon got Inseop up and sat him on his thigh.\u00a0With a friendly pose as if hugging a child, Lee Wooyeon constantly dug between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u201cWrap your legs around my waist.\u00a0Ywah, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0haa, hang on to me.\u00a0If you want to taste more cocks, yes, ah, well done.\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop\u2019s head.\u00a0When he kissed the nape of his neck, Inseop blinked in surprise.\u00a0A single tear ran down his cheek.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon put Inseop\u2019s tears on his lips and smiled.\u00a0At that smile, Inseop\u2019s heart started beating like crazy.\u00a0Not wanting to let him see his reddened face, he buried his face in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s neck.\u201cHug me tight.\u00a0Right now, I have no control.\u201dAt the same time the dangerous and low voice echoed in Inseop\u2019s ear, his genitals dug deep enough to emit a sound.\u00a0It was so hot it felt like he was about to break down.\u00a0Inseop hugged Lee Wooyeon and cried.\u00a0He was afraid of what his heart might become, and he couldn\u2019t suppress the sensations in his body, \u2026\u00a0He liked Lee Wooyeon so much, Choi Inseop burst into tears.Lee Wooyeon clenched her teeth and pushed himself into Inseop\u2019s body with all his strength.\u00a0Every time he stirred the narrow inner wall, Inseop flinched and hugged Lee Wooyeon\u2019s neck.\u00a0With all his might.Seeing his slender body swaying in his arms, Lee Wooyeon felt the warm blood spreading in his chest.\u00a0At one point, he was so excited that he thought that the veins in his heart had ruptured and blood was leaking out.\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing\u2013.\u00a0Inseop, even if I put it in, you keep tightening it endlessly, fuck.\u201d\u201cHa, ah!\u00a0uh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ugh, ah! Heuk, ugh.\u201d\u201cWith an innocent face, you have a greedy pussy.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ugh, ah!! Haa!\u00a0Ah, slow, slower\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you everything, so open your hole and eat a lot, fu\u2014 \u2014.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s waist, pressed it down, and sunk his teeth into him.\u00a0Hot semen poured out into his hole.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon narrowed his eyes and moved his waist once more, and a couple of hot streams of semen shot inside.\u00a0The semen that filled the inside and overflowed was pouring down between Inseop\u2019s buttocks.\u00a0Inseop wept softly and trembled every time semen flowed out.Lee Wooyeon liked that trembling.\u00a0It was somehow strange and pretty for Choi Inseop to move in his arms.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop and quietly tasted the feeling of him moving.He wanted to taste Choi Inseop a little more.Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hair with his hand.\u00a0Inseop raised his head as if he was out of breath.\u00a0The moment their eyes met, Lee Wooyeon realized what he was trying to do.\u00a0Kiss his lips\u00a0Surprised, Choi Inseop shut his mouth and stiffened, and Lee Wooyeon bit his lower lip, forcing him to open his mouth.\u00a0He explored it.\u00a0The sensation of the little tongue brushing against him and the feel of his teeth as he swept his tongue inside his mouth ignited his body.\u00a0The feeling inside Choi Inseop\u2019s mouth was so good that he felt regret as to why he had only tasted this now.As the kiss got longer, Inseop\u2019s breath got steeper.\u00a0Every time his lips parted slightly, Inseop gasped desperately like a drowning person.\u00a0The figure was so cute that Lee Wooyeon deliberately did not let Inseop go until just before he collapsed due to shortness of breath.\u201cHaa, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0haa, wai\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Wait, can\u2019t\u2026\u00a0Breath-.\u201d\u201cYou can breathe through your nose.\u201d\u201cAck\u2013, haa\u2026\u00a0haa\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWhy are you acting like someone who has never kissed before?\u201dInseop\u2019s eyes turned red at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mischievous teasing.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who knew the meaning of the change, smiled and asked.\u201cReally, you haven\u2019t even kissed?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2015\u2015.\u201d\u201cMr. Choi Inseop, I\u2019m the first to taste all your holes.\u201dWith a satisfied face, Lee Wooyeon placed his lips on Inseop\u2019s lips again.\u00a0When their lips touched lightly, Inseop blushed again and bowed his head.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon narrowed his eyes and smiled at the sight of Inseop, who blushed like a shy girl and did not know what to do with one kiss after doing everything they had done.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop shuddered as he felt the other person\u2019s lower part getting harder again.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed his shoulder with his hand and whispered sweetly as if it would melt.\u00a0Shall we go to bed now?Knowing that he had only one option, Inseop had no choice but to nod his head, seemingly invisible.As Lee Wooyeon continued and interrupted, he heard the sounds around him.\u00a0He lived. He was not dead, he\u2019s alive.As he thought about it, he felt his heart beating violently.\u00a0The frantic voice of his mother could be heard\u00a0 faintly as he started to lose consciousness.\u00a0Jennie, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0What the hell\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, then the funeral\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0How to tell Peter\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.What did she mean?\u00a0Why was she talking about funerals when he\u2019s alive?\u00a0He\u2019s not dead.\u00a0So she doesn\u2019t have to talk like that\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0why was mom cryingHe tried to calm himself down, but he couldn\u2019t open his eyes.\u00a0But the words entered his head more clearly than before.\u00a0She wrote about Peter in his will, so Jennie\u2019s mother told the police to investigate\u2026\u00a0, she must also want to turn her anger somewhere because her daughter is dead, so what was wrong with Peter, they were best friends\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0So, how was the funeral going?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.His heart raced.\u00a0What the heck, he wished someone could explain to him in an easy-to-understand way, but why couldn\u2019t he open his eyes?\u00a0Why was Jennie dead?\u00a0Why did the police come?\u00a0There was a funeral.\u00a0Why did Jennie die?\u00a0Wait.\u00a0Wait, please explain, who, wait\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dAs he got up, his breath caught in his throat as if someone had strangled him.\u00a0He grabbed his neck and tried to breathe, but he couldn\u2019t breathe.\u00a0His stomach was churning and he couldn\u2019t see well, so he grabbed the sheets of the bed with his trembling hands.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dA friendly voice spoke out.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know who it was, but he was the only person he could lean on in this darkness, so he reached out and grabbed him.\u201cIt\u2019s a dream.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u00a0Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dA large hand brushed his hair and patted him on the back.\u00a0It reassured him so much that he put his face to his face and leaned against the other person without realizing it.\u00a0As if surprised by the sudden action, his hand paused for a moment, and then a sound of laughter flowed.\u00a0It was a soft and pleasant laugh.\u201cYou have a bad habit.\u00a0When Inseop sees something scary, he acts so pretty.\u201dWho was Inseop?\u00a0Who was he calling so kindly?He leaned on his broad shoulders and took a deep breath in thought.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He envied that person.\u00a0Who was Inseop?\u00a0Because there are people who call him with such a friendly voice.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0Just breathe slowly.\u00a0slowly.\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0There\u2019s nothing scary about it.\u00a0It\u2019s all a dream.\u201dHe inhaled and exhaled slowly as the voice told him.\u00a0His stuffy chest was relieved.\u00a0His vision, which had been spinning in the dark, gradually became clearer.\u201cAre you stable?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cCan you tell who I am?\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed to Inseop\u2019s sweaty forehead and asked.\u00a0Choi Inseop blinked his eyes a couple of times and looked at him blankly.\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201dThe beautiful person asked so kindly.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t remember his name, but the eyes looking at him got used to him, and he nodded slightly.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Good job.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what he did well, but Inseop liked the feeling of the hand that touched him, so he closed his eyes again.\u00a0Leaning on his broad shoulders, his heavy breathing slowly subsided.Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop, who was sleeping in his arms.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body was drenched in cold sweat as if he had had some terrible nightmare.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled the sheet and put it on Inseop\u2019s body.\u00a0After waiting for Inseop to fall asleep completely, he got out of bed. With a warm wet towel, Lee Wooyeon carefully wiped Inseop\u2019s forehead.As if he liked the warm feeling, Inseop, who was sleeping, smiled and turned his body.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know because he didn\u2019t smile often, but the smiling face wasn\u2019t too bad either.\u00a0It would be okay if he smiled often.He liked his face, and until dawn fell on the window, Lee Wooyeon laid down next to Inseop and patted his shoulder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

69Chapter 69Translated by NaralaraEdited by Naralara\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0You just don\u2019t have to buy it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cHow are you going to go to Hawaii in that outfit?\u00a0Come out wearing something else.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon ordered, Inseop went into the changing room with other clothes.\u00a0The moment Lee Wooyeon entered the department store, people\u2019s eyes were all on him.\u00a0As a manager, he was in a position to prevent crowds of people, but Choi Inseop was led by him and was only changing clothes from before.\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t fit\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop wore the clothes that Lee Wooyeon picked out and looked at his reflection in the mirror in the dressing room.\u00a0A sigh came out.He had a body that was qualitatively different from Lee Wooyeion, who looked good in whatever clothes he wore like the clothes were tailored by the designer for him.\u00a0He was so skinny that he thought he would stand out more if he wore clothes like this, so his shoulders hung low.If possible, he would like to walk around in Hawaii wearing only a neat suit like the one Ihe was wearing now\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re all changed, so why didn\u2019t you come out?\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m, I\u2019m coming out now.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop grabbed his clothes and went out, Lee Wooyeon pushed him back into the dressing room.\u201cThe clothes you\u2019re wearing now don\u2019t suit you.\u00a0Change again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dThinking that he was lucky, Inseop sighed in relief.\u00a0As he was taking off the clothes he was wearing, Lee Wooyeon pulled back the curtain and pushed his face inside.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u00a0Why, why are you like this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather let you be naked.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cHurry up and get dressed.\u00a0I don\u2019t have time.\u201dAlong with the sound of his shoes, the sound of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s laughter faded away.\u00a0Inseop quickly changed into the clothes he was wearing and handed the clothes to the staff in front of the changing room, saying he was sorry.On the way to other department stores, people\u2019s attention continued.\u00a0There were many people taking pictures, and in the meantime, there were people who came up to him with courage and asked for autographs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon politely declined and blinked at Choi Inseop telling him to follow him quickly.\u201cWelcome\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Oh.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon entered the store, the staff who recognized him exclaimed in surprise.\u00a0No matter which famous celebrities came, they were educated not to show off their personal feelings too much, but when Lee Wooyeon appeared, the store was in turmoil.\u201cCan I help you, Sir?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll look around and ask for help if I need it.\u201d\u201cAnytime, just tell me.\u00a0Sir.\u201dThinking it was a very selfish comment, Inseop followed Lee Wooyeon.\u201cHow about this?\u201dLee Wooyeon picked something out and looked at Inseop\u2019s body and asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what your style\u00a0 is like.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201dChoi Inseop answered honestly.\u00a0He wore mostly clothes his mother bought him, and since he came to Korea, he only wore a suit with a neat color.\u00a0He never had a particular taste for clothes.\u00a0He just focused on choosing the most inconspicuous and comfortable clothes.\u201cI think it\u2019s okay to wear something a little flashy, but if it\u2019s too bright, it doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d\u201cWho is it for?\u00a0Is it for this customer?\u201dThe clerk, who was only looking for opportunities to intervene, said he was right, and pointed to Choi Inseop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was choosing clothes with a smile, answered yes, dryly.\u00a0Inseop, who could now understand whether he is in a good mood or not just by hearing his tone, looked at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes and looked at the clerk\u2019s face.\u201cThe customer has a pale face and has a light hair color, so you will be well received by these calm colors.\u00a0How about this?\u201dThe clerk picked a beige tee and put it under Inseop\u2019s face.\u201cUhm\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cHow about this?\u00a0It\u2019s a new product, and the response is very good.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cWhat style do you want?\u00a0Tell us, and we\u2019ll figure it out\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI will choose.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and stopped talking to the clerk.\u201cIf you tell me, I will help\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0I\u2019ll pick something and ask for help if I need it.\u00a0Thank you.\u201dIt was a soft but firm refusal.\u00a0As the clerk walked away with regret, Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue with an angry face.\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what angered him, but in this case, it was best to just quietly follow him.\u00a0Choi Inseop bowed his head to the store staff and followed Lee Wooyeon.Looking at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s back, who was walking in strides earlier, Inseop said as if muttering.\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0We were going to buy some clothes with a happy heart, but I look like this, so all the clothes don\u2019t suit me\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWhat does Inseop look like?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop could not help but suffer to discuss his appearance in front of a man who was always chosen without fail when selecting an actor with the most beautiful face in Korea,\u201cWhat do you look like?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugly\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t say the next thing.\u00a0Even looking at the height difference reflected in the show window, his difference with Lee Wooyeon was a great as the sky and the ground.\u201cInseop, you\u2019re pretty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cWhen you cry.\u201dWhen he added that to his previous meaningful response, Inseop lowered his head, not knowing where to put his body.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon came to Inseop\u2019s side and made him face toward the show window.\u201cWhere are you ugly?\u00a0Look.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cYou have big eyes, a cute nose, and pretty lips.\u201d\u201cAh, no.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u00a0You don\u2019t have to comfort me.\u201dInseop removed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand and turned his head.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and started walking again.\u00a0People\u2019s eyes followed his footsteps.Choi Inseop walked quickly and followed him.\u201cI thought the store was fine.\u201d\u201cWhich store are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThe store we just came out of.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Didn\u2019t you come out because you didn\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t like the clerk.\u201dChoi Inseop tilted his head and muttered, \u201cHe\u2019s kind.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t like him.\u00a0I have to choose Inseop\u2019s clothes, but he\u2019s choosing them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Is it bad for the clerk to pick out clothes?\u201d\u201cOriginally, the person who takes the clothes off chooses them.\u201dChoi Inseop was shocked and looked around.\u00a0Fortunately, no one was standing from where they could hear their conversation.\u201cDid you think that I was buying clothes for Inseop with a really good heart?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026Sorry.\u00a0You\u2019re not like that\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cYes, of course, I am not that kind of person.\u00a0Hahaha.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was smiling, heard the phone ringing in his pocket, and said, \u201cWait a minute,\u201d and answered the call.As he was answering the phone, store associates took pictures with their cell phones from a distance.\u00a0Inseop took a step back so that he did not appear in the photo.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was talking on the phone with a smile, turned serious.\u00a0Inseop was worried, but could not approach him and stood looking at him.Lee Wooyeon said \u2018I understand\u2019, and ended the call.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cThe editor of the magazine wants to see me for a short time now as there are some filming problems for tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll have the car ready.\u201dAt this point, Inseop thought that the shopping was over.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon shook his head.\u201cNo.\u00a0We said we\u2019d see each other around here, so I think we\u2019ll just have to talk for about forty or fifty minutes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then where do we go?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and took the card out of his wallet and handed it to Inseop.\u201cGo shopping.\u00a0Even if you come with me, it will just be boring talk anyway.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0This.\u00a0This is enough.\u201dThere were three shopping bags Inseop was carrying.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want more clothes than that, and he hated shopping with Lee Wooyeon\u2019s card even more.\u201cBuy some more.\u201dLee Wooyeon put the card in Choi Inseop\u2019s pocket, lowered his head and whispered, \u2018I have fun taking it off.\u2019Inseop\u2019s face was hot and he was frozen in place.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked at his watch and said,\u201cThen see you at five.\u00a0Where shall we meet?\u201dChoi Inseop did not have a cell phone, so he had to set an exact meeting place.\u00a0Inseop, who looked around for a while, found a bookstore and replied, \u201cThen there.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Then wait in the front for me at 5 o\u2019clock.\u201dLee Wooyeon once again confirmed the appointment time and disappeared.\u00a0Inseop, who received the card, thought about what clothes to buy, and decided to buy a plain white short-sleeved T-shirt.\u00a0After buying a white T-shirt that was so plain that no one would be interested in seeing him wear it, In-seop checked the time.There were still 30 minutes until the 5 o\u2019clock he promised with Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Inseop, who went to the bookstore to buy a book, found a travel book corner and stopped there.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Hawaii\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe pulled out a book with the word Hawaii written on it on a colorful background.\u00a0Tomorrow he will go to Hawaii for Lee Wooyeon\u2019s photoshoot.Hawaii was one of the places he wanted to visit someday while reading travel stories of people traveling around the world as a child.\u00a0Inseop opened the book and looked at the pictures in it.\u00a0After looking at the pictures of the beautiful beaches and the natural environment, he started reading the description below.Just as he was about to read the description of the must-eat food in Hawaii, someone stole the book from his hand.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cEnjoying Hawaii 100 times more? Are you trying to enjoy 100 times more than now?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and turned the book that Inseop was holding.\u00a0The people in the bookstore screamed and all looked at them.\u201cSorry.\u00a0The time is already\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dWhen Inseop checked his watch, he could see that the promised five o\u2019clock had already passed.\u201cI found you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient because you don\u2019t have a cell phone.\u201dWhen Inseop did not appear in front of the bookstore he had promised, Lee Wooyeon was furious.\u00a0He circled the neighborhood three times.\u00a0He even went to each store and asked if the person who was with him came.\u00a0No one remembered the existence of an introverted manager who came with Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon went back to the bookstore where he had finally decided to meet, thinking that he would break his leg if caught.\u00a0Just in case, when he went inside, he saw Choi Inseop reading a book with his eyes twinkling like a child in the travel book corner.\u00a0Thinking that he had to go home and pay for his anger, Lee Wooyeon approached Inseop.\u201cI was reading a book\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon handed him the book Inseop was reading.\u00a0Seeing Inseop put it down on the bookshelf again, Lee Wooyeon asked as if puzzled.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to buy it?\u201d\u201cUh.\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going on a trip..\u201d\u201cAfter filming, one day will be for sight-seeing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon picked up the book Choi Inseop had put down.\u201cYou can\u2019t buy it!\u201d\u201cI want to read.\u201dAs he went with the book to the cashier, people gathered nearby like a cloud.\u00a0Even the clerk who was doing the checkout was surprised by the sudden appearance of Lee Wooyeon, and opened his eyes wide and scanned the barcode with the scanner.\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter completing the calculation, Lee Wooyeon took the book and left the bookstore.\u00a0People rushed after him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon spoke to Inseop in a plain voice as if he didn\u2019t care about the people following him.\u201cIs this your first time in Hawaii?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good place.\u00a0I went for a movie shoot once before, and it was just okay to watch.\u00a0Is there anywhere you want to go to?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my first time, so I don\u2019t know.\u201dAs he went down the escalator, Lee Wooyeon gave Inseop the book he had bought.\u201cRead it and tell me where you want to go by tomorrow.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0After all, the last day is free time for us.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dEven after accepting the book, Inseop was not at ease.\u00a0These days, whenever Lee Wooyeon treats him well in this way, he doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0Disappointed but happy.\u00a0However, at the same time, he wondered if it was okay for him to do this, and he only felt sorry for Jennie and Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWhy do you look like that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dAs he walked out of the first floor of the department store and walked to the parking lot, Lee Wooyeon persistently asked Inseop.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s nothing.\u00a0Why do you look like that?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a good look at all.\u00a0Why? \u00a0Because I\u2019m good to you, do you feel dirty?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe should have answered no right there, but Inseop missed the timing.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon continued with a soft smile.\u201cYou really make people feel like shit.\u00a0I took the time to bring you to the department store, buy you clothes, books, and tell you to choose the place you want to go, but you put on that kind of expression.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201dChoi Inseop couldn\u2019t have known that Lee Wooyeon deliberately took time to come to the department store. Because he was only a manager who managed his schedule and followed him.\u201cI smile even when I\u2019m not in a good mood.\u00a0The promised month is less than a week away.\u00a0Did you forget?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u00a0I understand.\u201d\u201cDamn it, it\u2019s really making me frustrated.\u201dLee Wooyeon sighed and walked ahead.\u00a0Choi Inseop\u2019s heart grew heavier than before.\u00a0As he approached the parked van, Inseop found a letter stuck on the windshield.\u00a0A letter was placed in front of the van\u2019s window almost every day these days.\u201cThis, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cLeave it.\u201dLee Wooyeon does not read the fan letter that comes to him.\u00a0His theory was that reading letters from strangers to him would be a waste of time.\u00a0Still, he couldn\u2019t throw the letter away in front of people, so Inseop carefully put it in his pocket.Lee Wooyeon went to the back seat instead of the passenger seat and sat down.\u00a0Choi Inseop smiled bitterly.\u00a0It was natural, but for a moment, thinking that he was sad about it, he was considered deceitful.As he started the car, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll start\u201d like he always did, as if to himself.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t answer.\u00a0He could read through the gritty air that his heart was tightly twisted.While waiting for the signal, Inseop glanced at the book Lee Wooyeon had handed him earlier.He saw the words Hawaii.\u00a0The letter tickled Choi Inseop\u2019s heart.\u00a0Inseop swallowed and calmly opened his mouth.\u201cTraveling, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0This is the first time.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my first time traveling.\u00a0For the first time since I was born.\u201dHe was weak, so school, home, and hospital were everything.\u00a0He came to Korea to get a job undercover, not for traveling.\u00a0In fact, even after he came to Korea, he had never been to a park.\u00a0Strictly speaking, this trip to Hawaii was the first trip he had ever taken.\u201cIs this your first time?\u201dLee Wooyeon also asked the question as if in disbelief.\u201cI am not feeling well, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I was almost at home.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t something to be proud of, but Inseop\u2019s voice trembled a little as he told his story.\u201cI\u2019ve read it in books, but I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Hawaii someday.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dAfter hesitating whether or not to add the word \u201cexpected\u201d at the end, he muttered timidly.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon replied with a smile.\u201cWhat are you looking forward to?\u201dInseop could guess that his mood was relaxed from his loose tone.\u201cJust, like the sea, the beach, the sun.\u201d\u201cYou want to go swimming?\u00a0By the way, did you buy a swimsuit?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I don\u2019t swim.\u201dBecause of the surgical scar on his chest, Inseop never even dreamed of wearing a swimsuit.\u201cYou\u2019ll go all the way there, but you want to come back without immersing yourself in the water?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine to just take a look.\u201dThe warm sun, the soft sand, and the foamy sea.\u00a0It was something everyone thought had nothing to do with them.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even think about belonging to it.\u00a0He was satisfied with just looking at it from the side.\u201cIf you want something, you have to have it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWill it become yours just by looking at it?\u201dChoi Inseop replied, \u201cI know,\u201d and laughed without enthusiasm.\u00a0There was a time when there was a world that he wanted to have and a world he wanted to belong to.\u00a0After realizing that it was impossible, Inseop had no desire for it.\u00a0No, he tried hard not to have it.\u201cIf you want something, try it.\u00a0Don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d\u201cMr. Lee Wooyeon, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0What do you do when you have something you want?\u201dIt was a question that suddenly popped into his head.\u00a0After saying that, Inseop realized that he had asked a pointless question.\u201cMe?\u00a0Well, what do I do?\u201dLee Wooyeon narrowed his eyes and muttered like a person contemplating what to eat first in front of a delicious dish.\u201cIt depends on what the target is.\u00a0If I can buy something with money, I will buy it with money, and if that is not possible, I can go and get it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you\u2019ll just get it?\u00a0Isn\u2019t that a crime?\u201d\u201cThen, I should pay for it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s way of thinking was not normal, so he couldn\u2019t keep up.\u201cIf you are alive, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Hmm.\u201dLee Wooyeon pondered for a moment as if lost in thought, then looked at Inseop\u2019s back and continued.\u201cI can just bring it to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Is that the end?\u201d\u201cYou can make them listen.\u00a0If they don\u2019t listen, just kill them and bring another guy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dAlas, he can never keep up.\u00a0Even if he dies, he can\u2019t follow him.While Inseop was blaming himself for asking a really stupid question, Lee Wooyeon suddenly asked a question.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop, what do you want to do the most when you go to Hawaii?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I can look around, I can walk around, ah, that\u2019s right.\u00a0If I am in the US, the phone bill will be less.\u00a0There must be a lot of payphones, so I call home often\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop, who was talking excitedly, saw that Lee Wooyeon was staring at him with cold eyes and quickly shut his mouth.\u201cDo you want to go home?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dIt would be a lie if he said he didn\u2019t want to go back, and there were too many regrets left here if went back.\u00a0Inseop quietly considered his honest heart.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who took his silence in a different way, smiled, revealing his neat teeth.\u00a0But his eyes did not smile.\u00a0A cold feeling flashed in his eyes.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon stared tenaciously at Choi Inseop\u2019s head, who was holding the steering wheel.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about looking at your passport except when you leave the country.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not running away.\u201d\u201cHow can I believe that?\u00a0I should tie your feet up when you sleep.\u00a0I\u2019ll take it off and throw your clothes in the safe.\u201dInseop\u2019s expression hardened slightly because he was a person who would remain so.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m joking,\u201d but Inseop\u2019s tense expression could not be resolved.\u00a0Thanks to this, Lee Wooyeon was able to laugh for a long time.On the way home, the two exchanged a few more nonsensical words about their trip.That day, Inseop packed his luggage for the first time in his life.\u00a0To Lee Wooyeon\u2019s question of whether he was excited, Inseop replied bluntly, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0But he couldn\u2019t sleep all night.Lee Wooyeon knew that fact too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We drew lots. Team leader Hong said he\u2019d give us a bonus if we exchanged ours with the lottery, but we didn\u2019t even pretend to hear it. Manager Cha was the only one who was happy he didn\u2019t get chosen!\u201dWith a face full of excitement, she poured out various stories to Choi Inseop.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time going to Hawaii, and I\u2019m really, really, really excited.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t sleep last night.\u201d\u201cMe too, I struggled a bit to sleep.\u201dWhen he answered like that, as if embarrassed, Lee Dayoung agreed, and expressed her displeasure.\u201cRight?\u00a0That\u2019s right!\u00a0My older sister just scolded me for saying I was excited.\u00a0I\u2019ve only been to Japan once, so I\u2019m really nervous.\u00a0I can\u2019t speak English very well, but Inseop, do you speak English well?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u00a0just a little\u2026\u00a0\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0We\u2019re all the same.\u00a0Koreans learn English in school, but we are all weak in practice.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dInseop smiled awkwardly and responded to Dayoung\u2019s words.\u00a0In fact, he had promised not to speak a word of English in Korea, so he only spoke Korean, and Inseop\u2019s native language was English.\u00a0Choi Inseop thought that he should only use English at an appropriate level in front of Lee Dayoung.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Ticket\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who went to get a ticket, saw Lee Dayoung and hardened his face.\u201cHello.\u201dDayoung recognized Lee Wooyeon and greeted him warmly.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon greeted her with an expressionless face.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u00a0Did you come on an errand?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019m also coming to Hawaii.\u00a0The director was looking for someone to help, so here I am.\u201dShe showed an expression showing she was proud of herself for overcoming the tremendous competition.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said okay and then turned around and disappeared to another place.\u201cLee Wooyeon, is not feeling well?\u00a0Don\u2019t you feel like he\u2019s angry?\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop blinked nervously as he looked at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s back, who was far away.\u00a0The moment he saw Dayoung\u2019s face, he could tell that Wooyeon\u2019s eyes were getting colder.\u201cDid you bring your first aid kit?\u00a0Of course, we can get there, but Koreans say that Korean medicine works better.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, if he is sick anywhere, please take care of him.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dInseop bowed his head in gratitude for her kind words.\u201cAh, don\u2019t be awkward. Mr\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Then I\u2019ll see you a little later.\u00a0I have to quickly get my ticket and go in to find duty-free items.\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0All right.\u201dInseop greeted her and walked towards the direction where Lee Wooyeon disappeared.\u00a0He walked faster and faster, and suddenly he was running.\u00a0Inseop took a deep breath and looked around.No matter how much he searched, he couldn\u2019t find Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He was someone who caught people\u2019s attention just by standing still, so he couldn\u2019t help but stand out when he was somewhere.\u201cWhere are you\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop was panicking and running all over the place, but it was not easy to find him at the infinitely wide airport.\u00a0His heart felt like it was going to break, he was leaning against the wall, panting for breath, and a hand reaching out from behind grabbed Inseop\u2019s shoulder and pulled him inside.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dLee Wooyeon blocked his mouth as he was about to scream in surprise.\u00a0A group of women with cameras around their necks rushed by infront of them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Are they fans?\u201d\u201cThey are crazy.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s reckless expression, Inseop looked around to see if anyone had heard him..\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0Because no one is here.\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed to a sign in front of the toilet saying cleaning.\u00a0Choi Inseop exhaled a sigh of relief.\u201cAre you so concerned to let other people know that Lee Wooyeon has a dirty personality?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cDo you want to be the only one who knows, Mr. Inseop Choi?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, no.\u201d\u201cThere is one aspect that only Choi Inseop knows.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s smiling voice from behind reached Inseop\u2019s neck.\u00a0Inseop was startled at the thought that something soft had brushed past him, and he turned around and checked.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was about a step away and had that kind smile.Was it some kind of misunderstanding?\u00a0Inseop wiped the nape of his neck with his palm and said as if muttering.\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to go through immigration procedures?\u201d\u201cWe should. But before that.\u201dLee Wooyeon reached out and rubbed Inseop\u2019s lower lip with his thumb.\u00a0Inseop lowered his head as he felt the heat rising from the tip of his lips.\u201cBefore I leave Korea, I want to let Inseop eat what he likes.\u201dA polite and gentle sound landed on Choi Inseop\u2019s exposed neck.\u201cUh!\u00a0Mr. Inseop!\u201dLee Dayoung, who had already become close with the filming team and was having a conversation without hesitation, found Choi Inseop and waved her hand.\u201cHe\u2019s Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager.\u201dWhen she introduced Inseop, he approached the people and quickly bowed his head.\u201cReally?\u00a0You look very young.\u201d\u201cHe is two years older than me.\u201d\u201cNonsense.\u00a0Even if he said he was a highschool student, I would believe it.\u201d\u201cI envy you, your skin\u2026If you were a manager, you would be up all night and tired, but how do you have such nice skin?\u201dChoi Inseop was bewildered by the unexpected topic of conversation, and he tried hard to say something back.\u00a0People found his reaction amusing and asked Inseop about his skin a few more times as if teasing him.\u201cWhere is Lee Wooyeon?\u00a0Weren\u2019t you together before?\u201dInseop\u2019s eyes widened as if in bewilderment at the question asked by someone passing by.\u201cAh, wait, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He will come.\u201d\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0I think you got something on your clothes here.\u201dWhen Lee Dayoung tried to remove the dirt around his shoulder, Choi Inseop blushed as he waved her hand away like he was burnt.\u201cNo.\u00a0I\u2019ll do it.\u00a0It\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cWow.\u00a0It seems that Inseop likes Dayoung. Oh my my.\u201d\u201cAre you two dating?\u201dPeople who interpreted Inseop\u2019s reaction in a completely different way laughed as if teasingly.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who appeared at that time, interrupted, saying, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThe relationship between Inseop and Dayoung seems special.\u201d\u201cYou have to take good care of your manager.\u00a0Still, Hawaii is a popular honeymoon destination, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be satisfied.\u201d\u201cI know, right.\u00a0I\u2019ll have to take good care of him.\u201dThe eerie madness that was felt in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s tone, which no one else knew, choked Inseop\u2019s breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed Choi Inseop and pulled him by the arm, asking him to go buy some coffee.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cReally, I didn\u2019t say anything\u2026\u00a0\u2026no.\u201dIt was useless to make excuses.\u00a0Inseop swallowed a bitter laugh behind Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWhat kind of coffee should I buy for you?\u201dHe recalled his duty and asked Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep on the plane, why would I drink coffee?\u201d\u201cBefore\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seemed like you didn\u2019t want to be there, so I said it.\u00a0And isn\u2019t Inseop already full because he drank a lot of other things besides coffee?\u201dInseop, who remembered what had just happened in the bathroom, quickly turned his head.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t miss seeing his cheeks, the nape of his neck, and even his earlobes glowing brightly.\u00a0He smiled and patted the stain on the hem of Inseop\u2019s shirt with his finger.\u201cNext time, drink it all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop covered the small stain on his shoulder with his palm.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon nodded to Choi Inseop, saying that it was time to board.\u00a0After confirming that the line they were standing in was different from the other people, Inseop tilted his head and asked.\u201cWhy are we standing here?\u201d\u201cBecause the class is different.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWhile I was making a reservation for mine, I put Inseop\u2019s here too.\u201dBecause Peter was leaving the country, not Choi Inseop, the one he was known as at the office, Lee Wooyeon intentionally booked the plane ticket.\u00a0Choi Inseop was aware of that fact, but he did not think that he would raise the class.\u201cIsn\u2019t it expensive?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0I will bill the office for everything later.\u201d\u201cI will pay the difference.\u201dWhen Inseop, who obsessively hates causing trouble to others, said that, Lee Wooyeon slightly raised his eyes and looked away.\u00a0It was a terrifying look.\u201cI don\u2019t really like talking about money.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cSince you know, don\u2019t talk about it from now on.\u201dEven so, he received more than what he worked for.\u00a0Following Lee Wooyeon and being guided to the first class seat, Inseop\u2019s heart grew even heavier.\u201cWould you like to sit by the window?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where.\u201d\u201cGo to the window.\u201dInseop went into the window seat and sat down as Lee Wooyeon told him.\u00a0Because it was an early flight, there were only a couple more people in First Class except for two people.Inseop took the book Lee Wooyeon bought from his bag and placed it on his lap.\u00a0While waiting for the plane to take off, Inseop opened and closed the book, then tapped the back of the book with his finger and opened it again repeatedly.\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0No, it\u2019s fine.\u201dIn fact, his palms were wet with cold sweat.\u00a0Choi Inseop gently rubbed his hand over his clothes so that Lee Wooyeon wouldn\u2019t find out.It was the first time he flew by plane when he came to Korea.\u00a0At that time, his head was filled with thoughts of leaving home, worries about the days he would spend in an unfamiliar place, and regrets for Jennie, and he was not even aware of what he was doing.Now he knew for sure that he was on the plane and that he was about to take off.\u00a0The captain\u2019s announcement was heard and the plane began to move.\u00a0Inseop looked out the window of the plane with an anxious face.\u00a0As the airplane engine made a heavy gurgling sound, he felt his feet collapsing on the floor.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dInseop was startled and grabbed the handle.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was reading the newspaper, asked Inseop as if teasingly.\u201cShould I hold your hand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dAs the plane gradually ascended vertically, Inseop felt his body being pulled upward.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon spread the blanket that was on the seat so that the space between the two people\u2019s seats was covered.\u00a0Then he put his hand under it and grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201d\u201cIt will be fine soon.\u00a0Until then.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s way of speaking was so sweet that Inseop couldn\u2019t shake his hand off.\u00a0His hand was hot under the blanket.\u00a0It felt as if all the squeaks he felt as he moved away from the ground were transferred to his hands.The seat belt indicator light went out as the plane reached a stable altitude.\u00a0As Inseop wriggled his hands inside the blanket and looked around, Lee Wooyeon released his hand.\u00a0The warmth that had covered the back of his hand quickly disappeared.\u201cYou stick to me only when you are afraid of something, so it looks like you will develop a bad habit.\u201dThe moment he heard the soft words mixed with laughter, Inseop thought that something similar had happened in his dream.\u00a0He thought about Lee Wooyeon who comforted him all night and whispered such kind words\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0it must be a dream\u201cHave you read the entire book?\u201d\u201cNo, I still have about half left.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0As you go, read slowly and decide what you want to do.\u00a0Flight time is long.\u201dSaying that, Lee Wooyeon closed his eyes.\u00a0Choi Inseop picked up the spread blanket and carefully covered his body.Knowing that this shouldn\u2019t be the case, Inseop put his head on the seat and watched Lee Wooyeon sleeping the whole time.All he wanted to do now was that.Lee Wooyeon found the car he had rented at the airport and sat in the driver\u2019s seat.\u00a0Inseop said he would drive, but Lee Wooyeon put him in the passenger seat.\u201cStay quiet today. It\u2019s my first trip.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop thought that it was his responsibility to let Lee Wooyeon focus on filming because he had followed him here as a manager.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0I\u2019ll try to get a hold of the steering wheel after a long time.\u201dLee Wooyeon wearing sunglasses was holding the steering wheel, so this was also like a pictorial.\u00a0Inseop peeked at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s profile, being careful not to get caught.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIs there not much to see here?\u00a0You\u2019re only looking at my face.\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you tired of seeing my face so many times?\u201d\u201cThat \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I won\u2019t look at you.\u201dInseop tilted his head to the other side.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and reached out and made Inseop\u2019s head turn toward him.\u201cLook closely.\u00a0There is no way I can stop people who come to my destination and look at me.\u00a0Yeah, I guess what you saw on the plane wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dHe thought he was sleeping, so he looked at him without being hesitant\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.Inseop\u2019s face grew hotter and he couldn\u2019t raise his head.\u201cIs it hot?\u00a0Your face is red. Should I open the roof?\u201dInseop nodded his head as he could not make any other excuses.\u00a0As the roof of the car went up, a cool breeze brushed against their faces.\u00a0That alone made him feel better.Inseop blinked and thought, \u201cOh, this is a trip.\u201dHe was traveling.\u00a0He was traveling with Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0With the person he loves \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0A trip.\u201cHow about traveling with someone you like?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked like that, as if he had even read his head.\u00a0Is In-seop surprised?\u00a0I asked.\u201cHow does it feel to be traveling with someone you like?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice was a little more excited than usual.\u00a0Inseop noticed the subtle difference.\u00a0Even if no one else knew, he could read it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Because he liked Lee Wooyeon.\u201cIt feels good.\u201dInseop answered honestly.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon reached out and stroked Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0As if he had heard a satisfactory answer.\u201cIt looks like it will be a fun trip.\u201dA picture-like smile was drawn on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips.\u2018It\u2019s fun already.\u2019\u00a0Inseop swallowed the words he could not utter and turned his gaze to the beautiful scenery breaking into the sunlight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Love History Caused by Willful NegligenceCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFilming began immediately after they moved their luggage to the dormitory.\u00a0Since they were filming on the beach, Inseop had to watch the filming site, sweating profusely under the parasol.When a photographer, known for being picky, gave instructions in English to Lee Wooyeon, he perfectly understood the instructions and changed his pose.\u00a0He paused for a moment and discussed with the photographer, the coordinator ran to him to fix his make-up and adjust his dress.Inseop approached him with a bottle of cold water a few times, but perhaps because he was concentrating on filming, Lee Wooyeon took the water and did not look towards him.\u201cI guess it\u2019s true that celebrities are really born.\u201dLee Dayoung, who was sitting next to him, said with a tone of admiration.\u00a0Inseop, who was thinking that way whenever he saw Lee Wooyeon on set, nodded and agreed with her.\u201cThat writer is known for being really dirty and violent.\u00a0A friend of mine is an editor for a magazine, and Paul Ansel is very fussy.\u00a0For now, the atmosphere is good.\u201dSeeing the photographer yelling at Lee Wooyeon, Inseop smiled awkwardly and nodded.\u201cThere\u2019s not much to do than I thought, and it\u2019s a perfect paradise.\u00a0Isn\u2019t it?\u201dShe sat on the sand with her shoulders back and a smile.\u00a0Dayoung\u2019s face, shining in the sunlight, looked very healthy, so she thought that Inseop was envious.\u201cWhy is Inseop so depressed after coming to such a good place?\u00a0Are you not feeling well?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m great.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong?\u00a0It\u2019s as if you\u2019re trying to force yourself to be depressed.\u201dHer words that he seemed to be forcing himself to be depressed were engraved in Inseop\u2019s heart.\u00a0It may be true.Just looking at these dazzling and splendid landscapes made Inseop happy and excited.\u00a0It felt like he was constantly looking around like a person on a trip, and his heart was infinitely excited and he was laughing out loud.\u00a0Each time, Inseop suppressed himself, reminding himself that he was not a good person to enjoy these things.\u201cForget about worrying for a while and just enjoy it.\u00a0When will you ever come back to a place like this again in your life?\u201dShe was an optimistic and strong person.Choi Inseop put his envious gaze on Lee Dayoung, who had a personality that he could not have.\u00a0She started telling Inseop about the must-eat foods in Hawaii.\u00a0Inseop thought that he wanted to go with Lee Wooyeon, so he made a serious face and listened to her.The coordinator, who was watching the two talk, touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hair and laughed.Lee Wooyeon, who was checking the photo work with the laptop connected to the camera, turned to the direction Inseop was sitting.He first saw Inseop\u2019s slender legs, which were exposed through the shorts.\u00a0If he held his ankle with one hand and lifted it up and down, Choi Inseop would cry and cling to him.\u00a0Then, touching his thighs and pouring out kind words, Inseop would bow his face in shame.\u00a0His gaze scanned the nape of Inseop\u2019s neck.\u00a0Next, he looked at Inseop\u2019s face, who was talking while covering the sun with his hand.\u00a0Forearms, fingers, hair, earlobes, cheeks, lips.\u00a0There was no place he did not look.Just like that, he wanted to take Choi Inseop back to the hotel, take his clothes off, and fuck him all night long.\u00a0He wanted to wet his insides with semen and melt them softly.\u00a0He hugged him again and again, but it felt like it wasn\u2019t enough.<What are you thinking?>Photographer Paul Ansel tapped Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm and asked.<I\u2019m not thinking about anything><Really?\u00a0How about taking another picture with that expression?><What kind of expression was it?>Lee Wooyeon asked with a smile.<The hungry face of a beast waiting to bite the neck of its prey.\u00a0Put away the friendly face you have now, and make a mean and ferocious face like you just did.\u00a0Because that\u2019s good.>Lee Wooyeon nodded his head.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s vision came into view again, giving Lee Dayoung a bottle of water.\u00a0At the same time, hunger cravings fluttered.When the photographer\u2019s signal was given, Lee Wooyeon slowly got up.\u00a0His gaze was fixed on Inseop, who was sitting in the distance.From the picky Paul Ansel, Lee Wooyeon was able to get an OK at once.After the six-hour filming was over, people gathered their equipment and started greeting each other.\u00a0Inseop got up quickly and helped clean up with the people.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was discussing today\u2019s shooting and tomorrow\u2019s shooting with the photographer and magazine director.After loading all the equipment into the car, Inseop moved away from Lee Wooyeon and waited for his conversation to end.<Shy boy.>Paul Ansel beckoned to Inseop.\u00a0Inseop turned his head and looked around, wondering if he was referring to him.\u00a0However, most people withdrew with their equipment.\u00a0As Inseop crouched closer to him, Paul began to speak quickly.<Would you like to go have a drink together?\u00a0I think the conversation between adults will continue.>\u201cThe writer wants to go have a cocktail together.\u201dThe magazine director next to him interpreted the director\u2019s words to Inseop.\u00a0Of course, Inseop, who knew immediately what that meant, blinked his eyes and turned to Lee Wooyeon.<I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0My manager can\u2019t drink.><Yeah, it seems like it.\u00a0Just looking at him, it\u2019s like taking a baby somewhere.\u00a0If you want them to work hard, take them with you.><I will keep that in mind the next time I choose someone.>Next time, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words penetrated Inseop\u2019s heart.\u00a0The end of the contract, less than a week away, was drawing nearer.\u00a0Choi Inseop knew that Lee Wooyeon would not believe him.\u00a0It was miraculous that his whims continued to this day.<Then we will go there first, so please follow us.>Paul Ansel seemed to like Lee Wooyeon quite a bit, so even though it was the first time he met him today, he showed an open attitude.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon also responded with a smile.\u00a0When all the staff left and only the two of them were left, Inseop asked Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWhere can I take you?\u201d\u201cYou can go to the hotel first.\u00a0We decided to have a drink at the bar down there.\u00a0I want to take Mr. Inseop as well, but I think the air is bad because of the cigarette smoke.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0I will be in my room.\u201dInseop was thinking about lying in bed alone, reading a book.\u201cWhich room will you be in?\u00a0My room is on the 12th floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop bowed his burning face and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll be in my room.\u201d\u00a0Lee Wooyeon reached out and touched Inseop\u2019s cheek.\u00a0He said calmly, then wait there.A fever rose rapidly in his heart.\u00a0Inseop tried to pretend to be cool and moved on.\u201cHow does it feel to travel for the first time?\u201d\u201cJust, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0great.\u201dIt really was that good.\u00a0When someone talked to him, he smiled first, and he looked beautiful no matter what.\u00a0And the most beautiful of them was walking in front of him.A man who he thought could never be reached was walking at a distance he could reach with his outstretched hand.\u00a0Inseop hesitated and moved his hand.\u00a0With just a little bit more, he could reach him.\u00a0A little bit more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201cWhat shall we do tomorrow?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop, surprised by Lee Wooyeon suddenly looking back, fell into the sand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon laughed for a long time at the sight of his legs twisting and falling.\u00a0He thought that the third-class slapstick comedy would be better than this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t stop laughing.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha.\u00a0How the hell do you fall over there?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0yeah.\u201dInseop procrastinated, got up and brushed the sand off his pants.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was happily watching the scene, suddenly held out his hand.\u201cI\u2019ll hold you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better than falling.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0No. It\u2019s fine.\u201dEven in the night sea where there were no people, they could be noticed by someone.\u00a0Most of all, this was a travel destination, so if Lee Wooyeon did a little bit well, Inseop would be so excited that his toes wouldn\u2019t touch the ground at all.\u00a0At times like this, he had to make up his mind.\u00a0It was a useless reason for rejecting Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand, which he wanted to hold.Inseop did not see the smile on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face.\u201cIs it better to fall than to take my hand?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I think that would be good.\u201dHe\u2019d rather just leave it that way.\u00a0Inseop answered by hiding his palms, which had become sticky with sand, and rubbing them over his clothes.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. Don\u2019t mind it.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s undeserved kindness made him think that he shouldn\u2019t have it.\u00a0He wanted that person to like him too.\u00a0and\u2026\u00a0he wondered if he will like him.\u00a0He had these types of absurd thoughts.Inseop deliberately responded bluntly and walked ahead.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was standing behind him, exhaled slowly.\u201cAre you doing this on purpose?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you deliberately dragging yourself out of your senses, and then making me feel like an ass? Is this how you get back at me because of that bitch Jennie or something?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that about Jenny.\u201dInseop, angered by the sudden insult to\u00a0 Jenny, responded.\u201cWhy?\u00a0What should I say then?\u00a0I\u2019m suffering this way because of a bitch I can\u2019t even remember.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0forget it.\u201dChoi Inseop started walking.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed his arm.\u201cJennie will love it too.\u00a0Because instead of her, her best friend spreads his legs and gets stuck by me. She will be happy to see it in heaven.\u00a0So, don\u2019t pretend to do it for her, and don\u2019t be pretentious.\u201d\u201cShe is dead.\u00a0You shouldn\u2019t say that about a dead person.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being dragged around by a dead person\u2019s wish.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that!\u201dA blue light flashed around Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes.\u00a0And at that moment, he grabbed Inseop\u2019s wrist.\u00a0A thin wrist was held in one hand.\u00a0It was the hand that he wanted to twist while watching him talking with Dayoung throughout the filming.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed the hand that Choi Inseop himself never gave up first.What is this?\u00a0What\u2019s so great about this?It was something that could be easily broken, taken, or thrown away at any time.\u00a0Even holding it in his hand, he didn\u2019t feel comfortable.\u00a0Rather, he was afraid that he would lose it, or that he would never be able to find it again, so his anxiety grew.When Lee Wooyeon put strength in his hand, Inseop\u2019s face became pale and he screamed in pain.He felt dirty.\u00a0It felt like he had become a foolish person who didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0He looked like a maggot wriggling in the trash.\u00a0He was so annoyed that he was helpless.\u00a0He terribly hated the feeling of being controlled by Choi Inseop.\u201cAh, it hurts\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dTears fell from Inseop\u2019s eyes and his body trembled with pain, and Lee Wooyeon released his hand.\u00a0On the sandy floor, Inseop grabbed his wrist and sat down on the spot and started crying.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at the figure, covered in saliva, tears, and runny nose, with cold eyes.\u00a0He felt even worse than before.Fuck.When Lee Wooyeon mumbled, Inseop was startled and trembled.\u00a0A cruel feeling made his blood boil.\u00a0It would have been better to live with only the cruel feelings that were rotten black.Lee Wooyeon laughed softly.Every time he looked into Inseop\u2019s big eyes, he smiled.\u00a0That tickling laugh seems to have made his head go crazy.\u00a0All of a sudden, wherever he looked, Choi Inseop stood there, with his pale eyes as if he were about to cry.\u00a0He was so affectionate and beautiful that he held out his hand when he came to his senses.Whether to laugh or get angry, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t know.\u00a0It felt like he was back in his fucking childhood when he couldn\u2019t understand people\u2019s emotions and didn\u2019t know what to look like.He looked at Inseop with a blank expression that had lost his emotions and reached out to Inseop.\u00a0Inseop sighed and shivered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop like that and made him stand up and kissed him.\u00a0Surprised, Inseop tried to push him away, but the more he did it, the more tenaciously he dug into Inseop\u2019s mouth.He wanted more, more, more, but he didn\u2019t know how to get it, so he was angry.Their lips parted, and Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cold voice came out through the gap.\u201cDo you like me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDo you like a fucking asshole like me?\u00a0Choi Inseop.\u201dInseop didn\u2019t answer anything.\u00a0He shook his head and couldn\u2019t even raise his head.Lee Wooyeon, who stood silently for a long time, disappeared leaving Inseop.Returning to the room, Inseop took off his clothes and took a shower.\u00a0It seemed that the tiredness had gone away to some extent when he relaxed his body with lukewarm water.\u00a0But the sad feeling was still there.\u00a0When he checked it in the mirror, a large man\u2019s handprint was clearly visible on my hand.\u00a0The pain every time he moved will be more tomorrow morning.\u201cI\u2019m going to bruise\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe stopped muttering and burst into tears.Lee Wooyeon was a much worse person than he thought.\u00a0There were moments when he shuddered to realize it even if he didn\u2019t want it.\u00a0Just like today.However, on the contrary, he also showed an unexpected kindness.Why did that person suddenly call his name in a friendly voice?\u00a0Why did he hold him in his arms every night and try to sleep?\u00a0Why was he kissing him, why was he holding him, why did he give him a present and hold his hand?\u00a0Why?\u00a0Why\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Why does he like that person?Inseop took water and wiped his wrist.\u00a0Even after rubbing with force, the handprints did not disappear.\u00a0It looked like a trace Lee Wooyeon left in his heart.\u00a0Inseop applied force and wiped it as if he was trying to forcibly tear off the marks.He had a wound on his wrist, and every time the water touched it, a stinging pain spread.\u00a0Inseop lowered his hand helplessly.\u00a0The more he tried to remove it forcibly, the more clearly the marks were positioned.He came out of the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bed, sniffling for a while.\u00a0When there were no more tears to come out, Choi Inseop stood up.He wanted to call home.\u00a0Like everyone else, he wanted to be consoled while whining like a baby.\u00a0He shoved the coins into his pocket.He put a thin jumper over him and zipped it up so that the scar left on his wrist was not visible.\u00a0Then someone knocked on his door.Please wait.It was at the same time that the man\u2019s voice whispered in his ear came to mind.What should he do if Lee Wooyeon comes?\u00a0Would he be angry he went back?\u00a0Or should he say sorry for not holding his hand

He couldn\u2019t even remember the last time he laughed properly.\u00a0He used muscles he hadn\u2019t used in a long time, and his face cramped.\u00a0He said goodbye to Lee Dayoung and walked out.Actually, none of it was good.\u00a0He fell into the pool with his clothes on, and his body trembled, and he felt as bad as the wet clothes stuck to his body.\u00a0The hand held by Lee Wooyeon was also throbbing and it was painful.\u00a0Most of all, he felt like a huge fool as he walked while dripping water.\u201cI\u2019m so stupid\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0the biggest fool in the world.\u201dThe road from the hotel pool to the lobby felt very far away.\u00a0He thought that Lee Wooyeon had come to visit him and opened the door.He saw a public phone booth while walking helplessly.\u00a0When he put his hand in his pocket, he grabbed the coin he put in earlier.\u00a0Inseop approached the phone as if possessed, inserted a coin, and dialed.After a few beeps, a familiar voice was heard.<Hello.>\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dThe moment he heard his mother\u2019s voice, a cry and a hot feeling rose in his throat.<Hello?\u00a0Who is this?><It\u2019s me.\u00a0Peter.><Peter?\u00a0Peter, where are you?\u00a0What is this number?\u00a0Have you come back from Korea?><Yes.\u00a0For a while, because of work\u2026>Even while he was talking, water dripped from his clothes and pooled on the floor.\u00a0Inseop grabbed the hem of his shirt and squeezed the water out.\u00a0That didn\u2019t reduce his pitiful self, but he wanted to squeeze out as much water as possible.<Then you should come home.\u00a0Where are you?>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Inseop answered, <Hawaii.><Don\u2019t you want to see Mom?\u00a0When are you coming?\u00a0Everyone is waiting for you to come.><I will come.\u00a0Soon.><How soon?\u00a0You said you were coming last weekend, so everyone prepared and waited at home.\u00a0Aunt Stacey was here, and so was Grandma.><After this week or so\u2026\u00a0\u2026>A hand reaching out from behind dropped the receiver.\u00a0When Inseop turned around in surprise, Lee Wooyeon was standing there smiling.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThe voice that spoke with so much coldness broke the gentle air around him.\u201cWho said I would send you after this week?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0After this week, isn\u2019t the promise with Lee Wooyeon not over?\u201d\u201cRight.\u00a0It\u2019s over.\u00a0But no one knows if Inseop will return to the United States or if he will be imprisoned.\u201dLee Wooyeon glanced at Inseop up and down.\u201cYou seem to have enjoyed swimming at night.\u201dEmbarrassed thinking about himself falling into the pool with his clothes on, Inseop could not even raise his head and grabbed the hem of his robe with his hands.\u201cI was drinking and I just came out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe whole time I was drinking, I thought that Choi Inseop might be crying in the room, so the taste of alcohol was bad.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t cry.\u201dInseop lied.He wanted to pretend he was okay.\u00a0He wanted to pretend to be okay in front of Lee Wooyeon, even though he looked like a fool who drowned in the pool, water dripping down from his wet clothes.\u201cI see.\u00a0I was worried for no reason. Someone was having fun without me.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand.\u00a0Inseop groaned and bent down.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled back his sleeve and checked Inseop\u2019s left wrist.\u00a0Twice as much as usual, the swollen wrist was a bluish, black color.\u201cAre you here to swim with this hand?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.\u201cWhen Dayoung called, did you want to go out with these hands?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0It was fine before.\u201d\u201cEven if it was okay before, it looks like this now\u2026\u00a0\u2026fuck.\u00a0Really.\u201dLee Wooyeon shook his head and swallowed swear words.\u00a0Whatever the reason, he was the one who made Inseop\u2019s wrist like this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand and pulled him away.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the hospital.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0If I steam it, it will be fine.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s swollen like this, it could be a crack in the bone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u00a0I will figure it out.\u201dChoi Inseop hated Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He really hated Lee Wooyeon for hurting him but now expressing his concerns with kindness.\u00a0He hated Lee Wooyeon because he was so moved by that single word that he hated himself for thinking like an idiot that this person might be really worried about him.Choi Inseop shook off Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon persistently stood in the way of Inseop.\u201cGo to the hospital.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cListen to me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not okay.\u201d\u201cIt is.\u00a0If I steam for a day\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s shoulder and said.\u00a0Passers-by began to glance at the two of them.\u00a0Although not as much as Korea, there were many Asians, so there were quite a few people who recognized Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Nevertheless, Lee Wooyeon did not let go of his hand holding Inseop.\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop\u2019s voice was choked.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t follow Lee Wooyeon\u2019s heart.\u00a0Unbelievably, Lee Wooyeon was sometimes kind to him.\u00a0By the time he got used to that kindness and leaned on it without realizing it, he threw Inseop without mercy.\u00a0Inseop wanted to be loved by this person, so he didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0When he hugged him, he suddenly wanted to give his heart away and he couldn\u2019t stand it.Inseop was more hurt by the fact that Lee Wooyeon injured him without blinking an eye than his swollen wrist.\u00a0In the end, he could only become that kind of existence to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I love Lee Wooyeon, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0If you don\u2019t like me and are trying to hurt me, then you don\u2019t have to do it any more.\u00a0\u2019Cause I\u2019ve taken all the hurt I can take\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop said in a weeping voice and pushed Lee Wooyeon away.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was watching him quietly, asked.\u201cDo you want to go home?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDo you want to go home?\u201dInseop nodded his head.\u00a0Tears flowed down every time he moved his face, but it quickly filled up again, blurring his vision.A verse from a book came to mind. It said, \u2018If you love someone too much, you will get sick.\u2019\u00a0Inseop\u2019s heart ached.\u00a0It seemed that the miraculously successful heart surgery would go in vain if it went this way.Lee Wooyeon sighed and wiped Inseop\u2019s tears.\u00a0Inseop didn\u2019t like his friendly touch, so he shook his head over and over again, trying to avoid his hand.\u00a0After Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s chin and made him unable to turn his head, he wiped Inseop\u2019s tears with his palm.\u201cYou can\u2019t go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0You can\u2019t go.\u00a0Anywhere.\u00a0So, go on\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Make me like you.\u201d\u2018Make me like you.\u2019At the last words added like a sigh, Inseop choked.\u00a0He lowered his head in despair, pain, and excitement like a drug that he was addicted to.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

73Chapter 73Translated by NaralaraEdited by Naralara\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0I\u2019m not doing anything today.\u201dLee Wooyeon said while applying medicine to Inseop\u2019s wrist.\u00a0Every time he touched Inseop\u2019s hand, he trembled.\u00a0Even though he was the one who did it, Lee Wooyeon was bitter.He shoved the painkiller he had brought from the hotel lobby into Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u00a0He made him drink water from a cup.The swelling of the wrist had subsided a little compared to before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon insisted on going to the hospital, but Inseop did not listen to him until the end.\u00a0Eventually, Inseop was led by Lee Wooyeon to his room on the 12th floor.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s wet clothes first and made him change into his own.After applying the medicine to Inseop\u2019s wrist, Lee Wooyeon placed a thin towel on top and a towel soaked in hot water.\u00a0Inseop just sat still and watched what he was doing.At Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words that he would not be able to go anywhere, Inseop was quite shocked and was in a state of exhaustion.\u00a0The hope that he might be able to go to the United States after two weeks was what kept Inseop going.\u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe shook his head.\u201cAren\u2019t you thirsty?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThis time he nodded.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon sat next to Choi Inseop.\u00a0Inseop shivered and stepped back slightly from his seat.\u201cAre you scared?\u00a0Are you afraid that I will hold on to the sick Mr. Inseop and commit a crime?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a fucking bastard.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon reached out to brush Inseop\u2019s hair, Inseop turned his face to the side in surprise.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon had no choice but to sit away from Inseop.\u00a0The two sat silently across the bed for a while.\u00a0There was an awkward silence.\u00a0It was like they went back to the first time they met.Choi Inseop thought about what he would say so that he could go back downstairs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked with his eyes down.\u201cHave you made a decision?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cA place you want to go.\u201dHe decided to finish reading the book tonight.\u00a0Of course, in this situation now, the book would not have caught his eye, and even if there was a place he wanted to go, he did not want to go with Lee Wooyeon.\u201cI want to go home.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen, no.\u201dInseop answered firmly.\u00a0Although his crying voice and frightened eyes were still there, Lee Wooyeon could read the firm will in his heart.\u201cThere is a pineapple farm, would you like to visit?\u00a0Inseop, do you like pineapple?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked in a casual tone.\u00a0Inseop didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cWould you like to go to the North Beach?\u00a0There\u2019s a shrimp truck.\u00a0It\u2019s a Hawaiian specialty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOr shall we go to the island?\u00a0If we go to Maui, there is Haleakala Park.\u00a0Let\u2019s watch the sunrise there together.\u00a0We can stay one more day.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop stubbornly kept his mouth shut and just sat there.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was angry.\u00a0The thought that he had to hold on to him somehow froze.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I know.\u201d\u201cIf you know, please be obedient.\u00a0You have to do well in the future.\u201dLee Wooyeon did not miss the fact that Inseop\u2019s expression darkened at the word \u2018in the future\u2019.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon stood up from his seat with a sulky expression.\u201cI\u2019ll go and smoke a cigarette.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026Okay.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s room was a suite with a balcony and a private swimming pool.\u00a0He took a cigarette and lighter from his bag and went out to the balcony.\u00a0Inseop sighed.When he pressed his wrist with his fingers, it didn\u2019t seem like there was anything wrong with the bones.\u00a0It was more swollen than painful, so it felt burdensome to move.On his finger, on his wrist, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He once cut his fingers with a knife before.Inseop smiled bitterly as he looked down at the hand that was suffering particular hardship.\u00a0After meeting Lee Wooyeon, it was thought that there were no holy places in his body.\u00a0Although the mind was more torn than the body.It was his first trip, and it ended up like this.\u00a0Inseop looked down at his throbbing wrist and thought that maybe this was a natural result.\u00a0It was unusual for Lee Wooyeon to be so kind that it was useless.Now this was the starting point.As Lee Wooyeon said.\u00a0The reason for staying by his side was his own will.\u00a0It would be foolish to procrastinate any longer with the pretext of revenge for Jennie.\u00a0So, leaving him must be his own will.Somehow, somehow, he will try to prevent as much damage as possible to others, and he will leave everything.\u00a0Even if he goes to jail, he will feel more comfortable than being with Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Really, he couldn\u2019t stand Lee Wooyeon any longer.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201dAs soon as he came in, Lee Wooyeon stood in front of the bed and called out Choi Inseop\u2019s name.\u00a0Inseop raised his head in surprise.\u201cDo you want to go out?\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed to the balcony.\u00a0To be honest, he wanted to lie down on the bed right now, but Inseop just stood up because he did not want to create a strange atmosphere for nothing.Lee Wooyeon took out the blanket that was on the bed sheet and wrapped it around Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0This was bad.\u00a0This was a foul.\u00a0He thought it would be nice if someone drew a line between kindness to Lee Wooyeon.As Inseop went out to the balcony, Lee Wooyeon sat him down on the full bed.\u201cLook at that.\u201dLee Wooyeon pointed to the sky.\u00a0Inseop, who involuntarily raised his head as he pointed, exclaimed, \u201cAh.\u201dA rainbow was floating in the night sky as it was raining.\u00a0Beautiful colors were mixed in the dark indigo blue sky and it was shining softly.\u00a0Inseop could not take his eyes off the spectacle created by the lights of the full moon that had risen.\u201cIs it beautiful?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dAn honest answer came out.\u00a0Seeing Inseop open his mouth and looking at the sky, Lee Wooyeon laughed softly and muttered.\u201cIt must be nice to see that and feel that way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just guessing.\u00a0I thought it would be beautiful to others.\u201dAt first glance, Inseop did not understand Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, so he blinked a couple of times and waited for his next words.\u201cWhat was Philip like?\u201d\u201cYes?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Why\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0suddenly.\u201dInseop couldn\u2019t figure out why Lee Wooyeon was talking about the past.\u201cHe was a great quarterback, and his girlfriend was the cheerleader leader, and so on.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cHe was the son of a great family.\u00a0This is a fact you already know, right?\u00a0Stalker.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice, calling Inseop a stalker, was playful.\u00a0But there was no playfulness in his eyes.\u00a0That was what he was talking about.\u00a0Inseop was very nervous and nodded his head.\u201cYes.\u00a0That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHave you ever thought about why I came to Korea to become an actor?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I have.\u201dThere were countless rumors about it.\u00a0When he found out that Philip, who suddenly disappeared from the United States, was making a living as an actor in Korea under the name of Lee Wooyeon, Inseop first thought it was absurd.\u00a0A student from a prestigious university who played football was an actor.\u00a0It was an impossible combination.\u201cWhat do you think is the reason?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dNumerous theories had been formulated, but the conclusion had always been that same.\u00a0He did not know.Inseop couldn\u2019t figure out why Lee Wooyeon thought about coming to Korea to become an actor.Lee Wooyeon, who was silent for a moment, asked.\u201cDo you know what APD is?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAntisocial personality disorder.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0antisocial personality disorder\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Is that correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLee Wooyeon sat down next to Inseop.\u00a0He spoke bluntly.\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThese days, they are often referred to as sociopaths and psychopaths, but the symptoms are not exactly the same, but they are similar.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop was confused because he did not know why Lee Wooyeon was telling him such a scary story.\u201cI was not diagnosed with APD.\u00a0You have to be 15 or older to make that diagnosis, but by then I knew how to behave to look like a normal person.\u00a0Later, I had a major accident.\u00a0Of course, it would not have been known because of money and status.\u00a0Still, I was kicked out to Korea.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop swallowed.When he was in the United States, he had the courage to go to Philip\u2019s house to hear from him.\u00a0Of course, he came back after being thrown out from the front door.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t figure out anything.\u00a0Phillip disappeared from there, as if he had never existed.\u201cDo you know the word unwritten intention?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0know.\u201d\u201cUnwritten intention refers to a case in which an actor judges that his/her act is likely to fall under the constituting factor of a crime and conducts the act in a state of anticipating the consequences.\u00a0For example, if I want to start a fire right now, but I know that Inseop is sleeping in the house, but I just want to start a fire, so I start a fire, then the crime of arson is added to the crime of intentional murder.\u201dInseop got goosebumps at the eerie metaphor.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u00a0I won\u2019t do that because it\u2019s annoying.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed as if it was joke, but now the joke was not heard lightly.\u201cPeople like me live a life full of unwritten intentions.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThere is no standard for judgment about the importance or seriousness of work.\u00a0Do you understand?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and asked again, but Inseop couldn\u2019t even nod his head.\u00a0He thought it was simply a bad personality trait, but because it was a mental problem that was classified as a disability, he couldn\u2019t help but feel creeped out.\u201cMr. Inseop, you shouldn\u2019t hurt people, you shouldn\u2019t bully animals, you can understand these things without having to explain them, right?\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dOf course, as Inseop was about to say yes, he shut his mouth.\u00a0For this man, the standard of being natural was not established at all.\u201cYeah.\u00a0Of course.\u00a0Just as you think the sky is pretty, it must be a natural fact.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cSo it is difficult for me to tell whether my feelings are the same as those of other people or different.\u00a0In fact, I\u2019ve never felt emotions that I felt confused.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m trying to do right now.\u201dHaving said that, Lee Wooyeon wiped Inseop\u2019s cheek with his finger.\u00a0Inseop couldn\u2019t believe the fact that a man with such a friendly hand couldn\u2019t feel his emotions properly.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who had been quietly touching Inseop, continued speaking with a slight frown as if he was troubled.\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to blend into society and pretend to be a normal person.\u00a0It\u2019s just a matter of figuring out how other people feel and pretending to be that way.\u00a0I am a good actor.\u00a0I won awards at film festivals.\u201dSeeing Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smiling face while saying that, Inseop\u2019s heart ached.\u201cBut Choi Inseop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, that is not enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do it properly.\u00a0I can\u2019t calm myself down.\u00a0I don\u2019t even know why I am like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop\u2019s heart warmed.\u00a0Even though he thought he shouldn\u2019t, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words kept sounding like a confession.\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start and how to deal with my emotions, and I often lose the string I\u2019m holding on to.\u00a0That\u2019s why I keep hurting Inseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon gently wiped Inseop\u2019s face. His cheeks and eyes, forehead and earlobes.Just like a blind person groping for something precious with his fingertips, Lee Wooyeon touched Inseop\u2019s face.When Lee Wooyeon\u2019s finger touched his lips, Inseop lowered his head.\u00a0While hearing that this person\u2019s feelings were different from his own, and even being told that it may be the wrong emotion, he wanted Lee Wooyeon to be with him.Was the feeling of liking someone so selfish?After Lee Wooyeon let out a long, long speech, he hesitated for a moment and then started to wipe Inseop\u2019s lips with his hand.\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t feel that the sky is beautiful, but I want Choi Inseop to look at it and think that it is beautiful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this enough?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.\u00a0The voice that asked that question suddenly felt lonely, so Inseop raised his head and looked into his eyes.\u00a0When their eyes met, Lee Wooyeon smiled kindly.\u00a0With beautiful eyes, Lee Wooyeon was looking at Inseop.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Hewished someone would teach him how to reject this person, Inseop thought.He lowered his head and kissed Inseop.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face quickly turned red at the touch of his lips moving softly closer and further away.When Lee Wooyeon saw that, he gave out a pleasant laugh.\u201cI guess I really am a fucking asshole\u201dWith those words, Lee Wooyeon embraced Inseop in his arms and began to kiss fiercely.\u00a0The blanket wrapped around Inseop\u2019s shoulders fell at his feet.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was looking at Inseop\u2019s wrist, felt him waking up and asked.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cYour voice went out.\u00a0You screamed so much yesterday.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d rather not speak.\u201dHe pulled his sheet and placed it on Inseop\u2019s body.\u00a0And then gently stroked his hair.Choi Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon, and intertwined his fingers with his.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon paused and looked at Inseop.\u201cThe morning shoot\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI have to go filming in the morning.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Sorry\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you apologizing for?\u00a0You made my dickhave so much fun yesterday.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dNo matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t seem to be able to get used to that vulgar expression.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon kissed Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0Inseop shivered at the tickling sensation and smiled.\u201cYou should laugh too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cLaugh a little.\u00a0Why are you not smiling more when you\u2019re not as fucked up like me?\u201dJust after hearing the great secret from Lee Wooyeon yesterday, Inseop could not hide his puzzled expression on how to react to such a joke.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha. You are very confused right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI shouldn;t have told you. What if you run away?\u201dThe hand that was stroking his hair quickly gained strength.\u00a0Pulling his hair to the point where it hurts, Lee Wooyeon said softly,\u201cIf you run away, really, I swear, I will kill you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you ever stab me in the back again. I can\u2019t stand it twice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Okay.\u201d\u201cBut I won\u2019t give you your passport.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Do whatever you want.\u201dWhen Choi Inseop spoke in a slightly quarrelsome tone, Lee Wooyeon burst into laughter again.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the morning shoot, I wouldn\u2019t have taken my cock out of Mr. Inseop\u2019s hole.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cGo to sleep.\u00a0I\u2019ll come when I\u2019m done.\u00a0If you are hungry, you can order room service.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll speak English better than me.\u201dHis fingers, scattered in his hair, caressed Inseop\u2019s cheek.\u00a0At that gentle touch, Inseop made a scruffy face and smiled at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon bent down and kissed Inseop once more.\u00a0Then, before Inseop got up, he left the room.Inseop, who had been tormented by him all night, closed his eyes again and went to sleep.\u00a0Unlike Lee Wooyeon, who has a steel-like body, Inseop\u2019s body was made of bones and flesh, so he was drenched in exhaustion.\u00a0He quickly fell into a deep sleep.How long has it been?\u00a0He heard someone knock on the door.Has filming already finished?Inseop forced his eyes open and checked his watch.\u00a0It had been quite a while since Lee Wooyeon left.\u00a0Another knock was heard.\u00a0Inseop went outside wearing a robe.<Who is it?\u00a0What happened?>He wondered if Lee Wooyeon had ordered a meal and left, so he asked in English.\u00a0But the answer came back in Korean.\u201cI\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, isn\u2019t it his room?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0Hold on, wait a minute.\u201dInseop looked in the mirror, adjusted his clothes, and opened the door.\u00a0Surprisingly, Lee Dayoung was standing in front of the door.\u201cUh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0How here\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI had something to give, so I went to look for Lee Wooyeon, but there were people there, so he said to leave\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop could guess that Lee Wooyeon had sent Lee Dayoung here on purpose.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Really, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s way of thinking was hard to follow.\u201cWow.\u00a0But did Inseop just speak English?\u00a0Your pronunciation is at the level of a native speaker.\u00a0How many TOEIC points?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cBy the way, did you sleep here?\u201dLee Dayoung widened her eyes as she looked inside the luxurious suite.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cI envy you!\u00a0I also want to be Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager. Mr\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0I envy you.\u201dInseop did not know how to respond to her selfless and honest reaction, only scratching his head.\u201cOh right.\u00a0This.\u00a0The head of the travel agency told me that he had a copy of some documentary evidence.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dInseop took the envelope and thanked her.\u201cYou are going to stay here one more day.\u00a0I\u2019m jealous.\u00a0We\u2019re going by plane tonight.\u201d\u201cYou must be tired, so be careful.\u201d\u201cIf you come to Seoul, please contact me.\u00a0Oh right, right, do you know my phone number?\u201dAs Inseop shook his head, Dayoung took out her phone from her pocket.\u201cGive me your phone number and I\u2019ll text you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t have a cell phone right now.\u201d\u201cNo paper?\u201dInseop said, \u201cWait a minute,\u201d and went inside and brought a notepad and pen.\u00a0Lee Dayoung wrote her phone number on a note and handed it to Inseop.\u201cHere you go.\u00a0Call me.\u00a0I made a mistake with Mr. Inseop yesterday, so after we go to Seoul, I\u2019ll treat you to lunch.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable.\u00a0Then see you next time.\u201dShe smiled brightly and disappeared.\u00a0Inseop closed the door and breathed a sigh of relief.\u00a0He never thought that Lee Wooyeon would send someone he knew here.\u00a0What was he thinking\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0really.\u201dAs he walked to the bed with a sigh, he wondered what the documents were sent by the head of the travel agency.\u201cWhat?\u201dIf he told her to hand it over to him, that means he can see what\u2019s inside.\u00a0Inseop sat on the bed and took out the documents from the envelope and read them.\u00a0After a moment, his eyes widened in surprise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cOkay.\u00a0Let\u2019s end it here.\u201dAt Paul Ansel\u2019s words, people ended up shouting, \u201cWell done, you did a great job.\u201d\u00a0Filming was delayed more than expected, and it only ended well past the afternoon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and greeted the writer.\u201cAre you thinking of working properly again next time?\u00a0In New York.\u201d\u201cIt is an honor if you can call me anytime.\u201d\u201cSince filming is over, shall we all get together tonight for a drink?\u00a0I know a good bar.\u00a0There are many women with killer looks.\u201dThe fact that Paul Ansel was a huge womanizer was something the industry knew well.\u00a0In the past, he would have followed with a smile, but Lee Wooyeon had Choi Inseop waiting in his room today.\u00a0Now, as soon as he entered the hotel, he was going to grab Inseop and fuck him once more.\u00a0It was all he could think about throughout the filming, that Inseop, who was entangled in his hands, was left behind in the morning with a messy face.\u00a0During filming, Paul Ansel yelled at him several times to not lose focus.Lee Wooyeon smiled faintly, thinking about putting his dick in a delicious, tight hole.\u201cSorry.\u00a0I have a prior appointment.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Then call me later.\u00a0You can get my contact information from them.\u201dPaul Ansel said, pointing to the magazine directors who followed him from Korea.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and nodded his head.\u00a0After greeting the staff, Lee Wooyeon left the filming set.It was already five o\u2019clock.\u00a0He thought it would be over at three, but it went over two hours more.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was holding the steering wheel, was in a hurry.\u00a0The roads in Hawaii were almost two lanes, so it was impossible to pass properly.\u00a0Hawaiians had a laid-back personality, so the same goes for driving.Lee Wooyeon, who was an American but had a Korean personality, beeped his horn to a truck that was driving slowly\u00a0 in front of him and overtook it.\u00a0Whenever overtaking, the cars ahead blare their horns in annoyance.\u00a0Either way, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t care at all.\u00a0All that mattered to him now was to get back to the hotel as quickly as possible.He finally binded Choi Inseop to him.A mischievous smile was drawn on the lips of Lee Wooyeon, who was turning the steering wheel.\u00a0Yesterday, he told Inseop about his secret.\u00a0It was because he thought it was the only way to get Inseop back, who had made up his mind to return home.Smoking on the balcony, he thought about the way ordinary people bind each other.\u00a0If Choi Inseop had been a woman, he would have gotten him pregnant and got married, but that was impossible because his partner was a man in the first place.\u00a0If a man could get pregnant, Choi Inseop would have been pregnant.\u00a0If he thinks about the amount of semen poured into him.Then what was the other way?\u00a0Choi Inseop, who was terrified and withdrawn because he swore to love him, couldn\u2019t believe those words.\u00a0Besides, the greed he was feeling right now didn\u2019t seem to fit the word love.At that time, Lee Wooyeon thought to inform Inseop about his condition.\u00a0He recalled the fact that sharing a secret increases intimacy with each other.\u00a0The problem was that it was too big for a secret.\u00a0It was a secret that his family desperately tried to hide.It was a gamble.\u00a0Having a bad personality and having a mental problem were two completely different things.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know if the other person would accept it or not.\u00a0It was a pure gamble.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon believed in the hand he was holding.Choi Inseop, who came all the way to Korea for a friend and suffered hardship.If it was Choi Inseop, he was kind, gentle, and a fool\u2026\u00a0If it was Choi Inseop who liked him, he would definitely accept it.\u00a0He believed so and started talking.\u00a0Talking was not as easy as he thought.\u00a0He looked into Inseop\u2019s eyes the whole time he spoke.\u00a0For the first time in his life, he sincerely hoped that he would accept him.At first, Inseop looked startled, but in the end he carefully hugged his neck.\u00a0That was it.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon laughed.\u00a0Now he won\u2019t let go.\u00a0He will never let Choi Inseop go.There was never a time when he felt sad because he did not feel the emotions that others naturally had.\u00a0It was still the same now.\u00a0Since he never asked others to understand his condition, he thought that no one should ask for his understanding.\u00a0This was how things were originally.\u00a0It was not going to change just because he was sorry, but it was okay to just let it go by saying that it was unavoidable.Still, he thought that Choi Inseop needed an explanation.\u00a0He wanted to convince him somehow.\u00a0Whether it was to reveal his abnormality or to provoke sympathy, he wanted to tie Inseop by his side anyway.He didn\u2019t know exactly where this obsession with Choi Inseop came from.\u00a0But Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t want to let him go.\u00a0As he hugged Inseop in bed all night yesterday, he vowed never to let go.He remembered Inseop\u2019s face with his hands open to embrace him while crying profusely with his red, swollen eyes.\u00a0With that alone, Lee Wooyeon was sucked in.He could not delay even the slightest thought of having his slender legs spread wide and plunging himself into that delicious hole.\u00a0He stepped on the accelerator and passed two cars in a row.\u00a0A car coming from the other side narrowly swerved past and spit swear words.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon laughed.\u00a0If he goes into the hotel now, he will hold Choi Inseop the whole time so that he can\u2019t even step out of bed.\u00a0The narrow hole will be drenched with semen to fill his stomach.\u00a0He will make Inseop cry a lot, make him hang on his arm, and hug his slender body until it breaks.When they went back to Seoul, he thought of rewriting the contract.\u00a0A few years this time\u2026 no, it would be better to make it a life contract.A car passing by shouted \u201cFuck off,\u201d and blared their horns.\u00a0The smile on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips grew wider and wider.\u00a0He parked his car in front of the hotel and left it to the valet to park the car.He saw the staff who came with him check out in the lobby to go to the airport.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon simply nodded and passed by him.\u00a0When he got on the elevator, Japanese tourists who recognized him greeted him in bad Korean, but Lee Wooyeon did not even acknowledge them.\u00a0Nothing entered his mind except Choi Inseop, who was waiting for him.As soon as he got down to the 12th floor and walked down the hallway, he thought that as soon as he entered the room, he would hug Inseop and say hello.\u00a0It was because he knew that Inseop was particularly weak at such a normal, trivial kindness.If Choi Inseop accepted his abnormality, he was also willing to accept normal behavior.Lee Wooyeon smiled and stood in front of the door.\u00a0As he was about to open the door with the key, he knocked on the door.\u00a0It made him want to see Inseop open the door with a bubbly face.\u00a0But even after a while, no sign was heard from inside the room.Was he sleeping?Lee Wooyeon pushed in the card key and turned the handle.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0I\u2019m here.\u201dLee Wooyeon entered the room, calling out his name affectionately.\u00a0The living room was as it was when he left in the morning.\u00a0He took off his coat and hung it on the chair.\u00a0As he entered the bedroom, Lee Wooyeon called Inseop\u2019s name once more.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u00a0Are you still sleeping?\u00a0Are you not hungry?\u201dHowever, he could not find Inseop, who he thought was sleeping on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon opened the bathroom door.\u00a0Nothing.\u00a0He searched the living room and balcony.\u00a0Again there was no one.\u00a0He went into the bathroom attached to the small room\u2026\u00a0Empty.\u201cMr. Choi Inseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon called his name again just in case.\u00a0No answer came back.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon bit his lip thinking that something was wrong.Obviously, even before leaving the room in the morning, Choi Inseop smiled with sullen eyes.\u00a0There was no way he could run away from him, Lee Wooyeon believed.He ran to the safe where the clothes were hung.\u00a0When he pressed the password to open it, Inseop\u2019s passport was placed inside.\u00a0Then he wouldn\u2019t have gone too far.He had to go outside and find him.\u00a0He caught sight of an envelope as he went out to the living room to pick up his coat again.Lee Wooyeon realized that someone came to Inseop when he wasn\u2019t there.\u00a0On the way, he went to Lee Dayoung.\u00a0As he went down to the hotel lobby, she was smiling happily while talking with the staff.\u201cMiss. Dayoung.\u201dLee Wooyeon called her.\u00a0Dayoung replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and smiled broadly.\u00a0Seeing her smiling face, Lee Wooyeon was furious.\u201cWhat time did you see Choi Inseop?\u201d\u201cWell, um, about thirty minutes ago.\u00a0I handed over the documents you told me to hand over to him, and I came right down.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say when you gave him the papers?\u201dLee Wooyeon thought that there must be a reason why Choi Inseop, who looked at him with a shy face even in the morning, changed his mind.\u00a0Lee Dayoung answered, \u201cWell,\u201d while tilting her head.\u201cI just said I liked the room, then gave him my phone number so that when we get to Seoul, we can have dinner together, um\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, it was nothing.\u201dEvery word she said annoyed Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked \u201cphone number?\u201d with a smile.\u201cYes.\u00a0I made a mistake yesterday, so I said I was going to buy him a meal.\u201d\u201cActually, you don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cInseop doesn\u2019t really need that.\u00a0The company\u2019s meals are good.\u201dLee Dayoung tilted her head, unable to grasp what he was saying to her.At that time, one of the staff came into the lobby, said hi, and started talking.\u201cI think there is a riot outside now.\u00a0Somebody got caught by the drug dealers by mistake, and they had a bloody fight.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Do you mean near the hotel?\u201d\u201cAcross the street over there.\u00a0Didn\u2019t you see the guidebook saying \u201cNever cross the street at night\u201d?\u00a0The quality of the neighborhood is rather poor.\u00a0There are also many drug addicts.\u00a0They say that even if you go into a public toilet by mistake, you can get stabbed by a knife.\u00a0Fortunately, the culprit was caught, but only the person who was stabbed was pitiful.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked in a calm voice.\u201cYes?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon suddenly spoke, the staff asked in surprise.\u201cWhere, who, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0You mean someone was stabbed?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Across the street, not the main street, but the road that goes up.\u00a0People are just gathering\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It looked like an Asian tourist, maybe.\u201dAt the last word, Lee Wooyeon ran out of the hotel lobby without looking back.\u00a0He bumped into someone with luggage in front of the hotel, but he didn\u2019t even apologize.Asian stabbed with a knife.That sentence was stuck in his mind.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon crossed the road without a crosswalk.\u00a0The car that was behind him stopped suddenly and swore at him, but he strode forward without looking to the side.\u00a0The alley going up off the main street was crowded with people as the staff said.Lee Wooyeon pushed them aside and went inside.\u00a0Police and paramedics, who had already arrived, were carrying the victim on a stretcher.\u00a0The floor was drenched in blood of the Asian said to have been stabbed.\u00a0The moment he saw it, Lee Wooyeon felt that blood was flowing from his heart.Lee Wooyeon grabbed the policeman\u2019s arm.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWait, let me have a look.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll check if it\u2019s someone I know.\u201d\u201cWhat is this person talking about?\u00a0You can come to the police station to check.\u00a0You can\u2019t do it here.\u201dLee Wooyeon knew what it meant to put a white cloth over someone\u2019s face.\u00a0He pushed the policeman who stopped him.\u00a0He had to find out if that was Choi Inseop.\u00a0Otherwise, he couldn\u2019t take a single step away from this place.He removed the white sheet covering the stretcher.\u00a0The police officer, who was pushed by him, got angry and grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u00a0As a result, the stretcher carrying \u201cthe body\u201d fell by Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u00a0You know what you\u2019re doing right now could get you arrested!\u201dThe policeman\u2019s angry voice echoed overhead.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon checked its face, which had fallen over.\u00a0In an instant, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s heart tightened.\u201cWho the hell is this guy?\u00a0Are you acquainted with the victim?\u201d\u201cI think he is.\u00a0Then, shouldn\u2019t you accompany them?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon put the stretcher back on the car and said.\u201cI thought it was someone I knew.\u00a0I heard that they looked\u00a0 similar.\u201dThe only similarity he heard was Asian. One.\u00a0At that one word, he frantically crossed the road, pushed the police away, and removed the sheet covering the corpse.It wasn\u2019t Choi Inseop lying on the stretcher.\u00a0It was not even a man, but a woman.\u00a0He did something that anyone would laugh at for being stupid.Lee Wooyeon got up\u00a0 and politely apologized to the police officer.\u201cI couldn\u2019t find my friend, so I was looking for him.\u00a0I am sorry for causing trouble.\u201dLearn moreThe Asian man who caused the scandal had a good-looking face and a genuinely worried face, so the policeman decided to believe him.\u201cI understand your feelings, but from now on, if you do this recklessly, I will arrest you.\u00a0Please leave your contact information.\u00a0And if the party doesn\u2019t come back late, come to the police station.\u201dThe policeman spoke in an annoyed tone and recovered the body again.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon left the place after telling the police officer the hotel, room number, and name he was staying at.Lee Wooyeon wiped the blood from his face with the back of his hand.\u00a0The only thought that came to mind when he saw someone who had just died innocently was \u2018It\u2019s not Choi Inseop.\u2019\u00a0Other than that, he had no idea.Lee Wooyeon crossed the street and entered the hotel lobby.\u00a0When he returned with blood on his white shirt, the staff gathered in the lobby looked at him in astonishment.\u201cOh!\u00a0What\u2019s wrong? Are you hurt, Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cMr. Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0What is that blood?\u201dLee Wooyeon stood tall in front of Lee Dayoung without answering.\u00a0He crossed the room and asked the question that ran through his head.\u201cWhat are the documents you gave to Choi Inseop?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe document you handed him.\u201d\u201cThe head of the travel agency told me to give it, what was it?\u00a0Oh right.\u00a0A copy of your travel insurance and ID that you submitted to rent a car.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon is a celebrity, so CEO Kim told me to take care of everything such as a copy of ID card one by one.\u201dLee Wooyeon pressed his forehead with his hand and closed his eyes.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Was there my manager\u2019s ID in it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0right?\u00a0I haven\u2019t seen it, so I don\u2019t know, because they gave me a copy of the ID.\u201dLee Wooyeon bit his lip.Choi Inseop got his ID card.\u00a0After all, that meant that he could leave this place at any time if he wanted to.\u00a0After all, he was a US citizen, so he was able to travel from Hawaii without a passport, just with an ID.\u201cWhy did you give it to Choi Inseop?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhy did you give it to Choi Inseop?\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon screamed, the people around him turned to look at him in astonishment.\u201cWell, that\u2019s because Lee Wooyeon told me to hand it over to him\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Dayoung answered with a trembling voice. He\u00a0was furious.\u00a0He was the one who deliberately asked Lee Dayoung to hand over the documents to show her Inseop was in his room.\u00a0It was him who did not ask what the document was.\u00a0In the end, Lee Wooyeon realized that he had given Choi Inseop the key to get out of this place.\u00a0For the first time in his life, Lee Wooyeon thought that he wanted to kill himself.\u201cUh, Inseop said he was going downtown earlier\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dAt that time, one of the staff members who came down late, paying close attention, spoke carefully.\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cHe said he was going downtown earlier, so I picked him up\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed the staff by the collar.\u201cWho did you pick up?\u201d\u201cAh, no,\u00a0 Inseop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cChoi Inseop said he was leaving, and you took him?\u00a0Ha, fuck.\u201dEveryone around them couldn\u2019t help but doubt their eyes.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who was known for his good manners, was wearing a white shirt stained with blood and cursing in the hotel lobby.\u00a0It was an unbelievable sight.\u201cWhere did you drop him off?\u201d\u201cYes?\u00a0Ah, the city, the city\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking where in the city!\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand, the man grabbed by the collar made a sound of gasping for breath.\u201cUgh. Mr. Wooyeon.\u00a0Don\u2019t do this, calm down\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but there are people watching, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0okay?\u201dLee Wooyeon threw the man to the floor.\u00a0Whether people looked at him or not, he couldn\u2019t afford to think of anything else.\u00a0Nothing mattered to Lee Wooyeon except the fact that Choi Inseop had left him.All night long, all night long, he held him in his arms and said that he liked him\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0He opened his hole all night and accepted his cock, the body that struggled for pleasure, and ran away with the legs that wrapped around his waist.\u00a0Choi Inseop.\u201cWhere did you drop him off?\u201d\u201cDowntown, I dropped him off downtown.\u201d\u201cWhere in town, exactly?\u201d\u201cUmm, I can\u2019t remember.\u00a0It was dark, just\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, on the way out\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed and smashed the flowerpot on the lobby table with his hand.\u00a0Red blood quickly ran down his fingers.\u201cOn the way out?\u00a0Where?\u00a0Say it accurately.\u201dLee Wooyeon said as he stood up to the staff with blood dripping hands.\u00a0His eyes were shimmering with cold madness, unlike usual, so those around him could not approach Lee Wooyeon willingly.\u00a0He fixed the collar of the staff, who was stunned by surprise.\u00a0Even though blood was dripping down his collar, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s expression was so calm.\u201cYou have to think about it.\u00a0Where did you drop him off?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026I, Uh, after to the Hilton Hotel a bit more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dAfter saying those words, Lee Wooyeon ran out of the lobby.\u00a0As soon as he got his car keys, he headed downtown.\u00a0he ignored each signal and stepped on the accelerator.\u00a0He randomly parked the car at the spot the man pointed out and started running.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon ran and ran like crazy to find Choi Inseop.\u00a0Wherever there were people who looked similar, he ran to them and checked their faces.\u201cIsn\u2019t that Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cI guess that\u2019s him, right?\u00a0Is he filming?\u201dKorean tourists who recognized Lee Wooyeon chatted.\u00a0Some of the bastards were taking pictures with their cell phones.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon wiped his sweat-soaked forehead and looked around.\u00a0He said it was downtown, but no one knew where Inseop would be.\u00a0Moreover, there is no guarantee that he will remain in the city.He may have gone to the airport.\u00a0Or to get your his passport back\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0If he went to a country other than the United States, would he be able to find him?When he thought that he might never see Choi Inseop again, his head hurt like hell.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed his head with his hands and tried to figure out where to start looking for him.\u00a0Where should he go to increase the chances of finding Choi Inseop?\u00a0If he was looking for him, and if he finds him, what should he do with that bastard?Find Choi Inseop.\u00a0He was thinking of finding him somehow.\u00a0If he finds him. He must find him.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I will kill you.\u201dLee Wooyeon mumbled in anger.\u00a0If he finds Choi Inseop, he will tie his slender arms and legs so that he cannot go anywhere.\u00a0He will cut off his legs so that he can never again abandon him and run away.If he can find him, if only he can find him.Lee Wooyeon was suffocating.\u00a0He was so angry that he was suffocating because of that one shriveled bastard.\u00a0It felt like the cells of his body were standing on end because of his anger.Choi Inseop, who reached out his hand as if to understand him, but ran away could not be tolerated.\u00a0Even when his family turned their backs on him, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t mind.\u00a0No, he thought it was better first.\u00a0Because there was no expectation of others.Then, what was he expecting from Choi Inseop?\u00a0He was thinking that that bastard would understand and accept him.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0The villain was not Choi Inseop, but himself.\u00a0Like an innocent girl, he fell for Choi Inseop and eventually gave up once more.\u201chaha\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, haha\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe laughed.\u00a0He ran around to the point of tearing his lungs, but he couldn\u2019t find a single hair of him, let alone find Choi Inseop.\u00a0It was surprising that he trusted Choi Inseop so much.\u00a0That bastard has already betrayed him once, so why did he regard him as an endlessly benevolent human like the Virgin Mary?\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0haha\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThat\u2019s right.\u00a0He was such a guy.\u00a0He was a guy who liked him but tried to stick a knife behind his back, so why did he believe that he had him in his hand?Lee Wooyeon was fed up with his recklessness.\u201cHey, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Aren\u2019t you Lee Wooyeon?\u201dThe woman, who looked like a tourist, said cautiously as she held out her camera.\u201cCan I take a picture with you?\u201dLee Wooyeon turned his head without answering.\u00a0Embarrassed by his reaction, the woman pouted her lips and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the hell?\u201d and went back to her friends. \u201cIf you\u2019re a celebrity, you think it\u2019s okay? Annoying, let\u2019s go.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cI need to go home and post on the internet.\u201d\u00a0A muffled voice reached Lee Wooyeon\u2019s ear.Lee Wooyeon turned and walked to the place where the women were gathered.\u201cPut it up.\u201dLee Wooyeon said.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cPut it up.\u00a0On the Internet.\u201d\u201cWhat, what?\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled brightly.\u00a0Even with his white shirt stained with blood, his face covered in blood, and his sweat-drenched hair, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s smiling face was so beautiful that it made everyone\u2019s heart pound.\u201cPlease put it up.\u00a0I will report you for defamation.\u201dAfter Lee Wooyeon said that, he started walking the way he had been going.\u00a0Abusive language about him erupted from behind, but his gaze was already directed elsewhere.A dark-haired man in a beige suit passed through the crowd.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon ran like crazy.\u00a0He will definitely find Choi Inseop again.\u00a0If he catches him in his hands again, if he just catches him.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon, who was running through the crowd, reached out and grabbed the man\u2019s shoulder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Blood.Choi Inseop greeted the foreign couple, who looked at him with strange eyes, with a hi, but there was no reply.It would look weird.\u00a0On the 12th floor, there were only five rooms, and they were all suites, but there was a man with an ugly outfit like him sitting in front of the door.Inseop carefully opened the cake box.\u00a0It was still fine, but the cream was about to melt.\u201c\u2026\u00a0Still shooting.\u201dMumbling to himself nervously, Inseop closed the cake box again.\u00a0It felt nice to go out to town to buy a cake, but it was only when he arrived at the front of the room that he realized he had come out without the key.The problem is that he left the key to his room on the 9th floor as well as the 12th floor.\u00a0Reluctantly, In-seop sat in front of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s room and began to wait for him.\u00a0It was because the hotel lobby was too crowded with people, and he could miss Lee Wooyeon.He hoped he would come soon.\u00a0The cake shouldn\u2019t melt.Inseop thought so and turned his gaze towards the hallway where the elevator was.\u00a0Every time the elevator stopped, there was a clicking sound.\u00a0Thinking it would be good if it stopped on the 12th floor, Inseop turned his head, but Lee Wooyeon was still nowhere to be seen.\u00a0It seemed to have stopped on another floor.He didn\u2019t have a cell phone, so it was inconvenient.\u00a0How did people meet and live in a time when there were no cell phones?\u00a0It seems that cell phones have become common in just a few years\u2026\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201dInseop looked up at the familiar shoes that appeared in front of him.\u00a0It was Lee Wooyeon.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop raised his hand in surprise when he saw the blood on his shirt.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s hand and forced him to stand up.\u00a0Before even asking what the hell was going on, Inseop was dragged into the room by Lee Wooyeon.\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t answer.\u00a0He held Inseop\u2019s wrist and just looked down.\u201cAre you injured somewhere?\u201dChoi Inseop asked, carefully examining Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body.\u00a0Not only his clothes, but also his face had blood splattered, and his hair was all wet with sweat from what he had been doing.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Are you here after filming?\u201d\u201cYou.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cWhere have you been?\u201dInseop blinked in fear at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s stiff tone.\u201cWhere the hell did you go?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0to buy a cake\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop raised the cake box he was holding in his hand and showed it to him.\u201cBecause this place is famous, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0The line was longer than expected and I was late.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry for making you wait.\u201dLee Wooyeon sighed and swallowed a short laugh.\u00a0He ruffled his sweat-drenched hair and looked down at Inseop.\u201cWait?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDid I wait?\u201dLee Wooyeon shouted in a voice filled with venom.He ran for three hours.\u00a0Each and every building, there was no place that he hadn\u2019t been to.\u00a0Whenever he saw an Asian man, he ran like a hungry dog and checked his face.\u00a0Using Choi Inseop\u2019s real name, he called the airport to find out if such a person had left the country.\u00a0Knowing he would be turned down, he called every airline.\u00a0He drove to the airport twice.\u00a0He ran all over the airport building, and every time he saw the staff, he showed him a picture of Inseop asking if he had ever seen such a person.Lee Wooyeon went around like a madman to find Choi Inseop.\u00a0He kept running, even though he knew he was doing something useless.\u00a0Even when his head told me it wasn\u2019t going to work, he couldn\u2019t stop himself.\u00a0He ran around as if it wasn\u2019t his own body.\u00a0He kept going, kept going.\u00a0until he got tired.Lee Wooyeon wandered around town until he accepted the fact that Choi Inseop could not be found.\u00a0When he returned to the hotel, he entered Inseop\u2019s room first.\u00a0Even after confirming that the room was empty, Lee Wooyeon searched the room again.\u00a0As he went up the stairs from the 9th to the 12th floor, Lee Wooyeon swallowed the bitter truth that Choi Inseop had left him and disappeared.\u00a0The emotion that ran through him set fire to his stomach.Anger, frustration, self-destruction, and betrayal of being deceived twice.Every time he took a deep breath, the dark emotions that accumulated were choking him.\u00a0For the first time, the feeling of self-blame came up.\u00a0About leaving Choi Inseop in the room by himself, about asking Dayoung to hand over the documents to him without knowing what was in the envelope, and, above all, to himself who gave Choi Inseop this much trust.Lee Wooyeon, who was walking down the hallway, with bitterness, saw Inseop sitting in front of the door.\u00a0He closed his eyes and opened it again, thinking he had developed a mental illness to the point where he finally had hallucinations.\u00a0However, as he got closer, what he thought was an illusion became more and more realistic.\u00a0At once, he grabbed Choi Inseop tightly.\u00a0Just like that, Lee Wooyeon dragged Inseop into the room.\u00a0When asked what he was doing, Choi Inseop held out a small cake box.\u00a0He was so upset that he couldn\u2019t even laugh.\u201cDid I wait for you?\u201dLee Wooyeon shouted at Choi Inseop.Because the emotions of the other person and the emotions he felt were different, there were times when he was not sure of the choice of words.\u00a0But now he could say with certainty that the word \u201cwaiting\u201d was not correct.It was despair.Abandoned by Choi Inseop, that time was despair for Lee Wooyeon.\u201cDid I fucking wait for you?!\u201dWith a voice filled with rage, Lee Wooyeon shouted.He took the cake box from Choi Inseop\u2019s hand and threw it on the floor.\u00a0As Inseop gasped, and turned his head to the cake box, he grabbed his chin and made him look at him.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I am\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, it\u2019s late\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop\u2019s lips were covered by Lee Wooyeon\u2019s, just as he was about to apologize.\u00a0It was a wild and violent kiss.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon tore Inseop\u2019s clothes by hand.\u00a0Inseop, whose wound on his wrist had not yet healed, twisted his body in pain, but Lee Wooyeon did not stop.He forcibly laid Inseop on the table and pulled down his pants.\u00a0When the fasteners were lowered, the lustrous genitals like a weapon were revealed.\u201cWooyeon, wait a minute, talk to me, wait\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Arg!\u201dLee Wooyeon shoved himself between Inseop\u2019s buttocks without any preparation.\u00a0While shoving into the tight hole, Lee Wooyeon embraced Choi Inseop.\u00a0Inseop shed tears and sobbed at the pain that cut through his body.Lee Wooyeon looked like he was going crazy.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to hurt Choi Inseop, but it didn\u2019t go his way.\u00a0His body didn\u2019t listen.\u00a0His eyes went white in anger.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t tell if what was going on was sexual desire or anger towards Choi Inseop.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u00a0Ow, it hurts\u2026\u00a0, st, stop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dInseop held the table and cried and begged.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked as he saw the handprints he made yesterday clearly remained on his wrist.\u201cWhy are you making me like this?\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ah, stop it\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ha, don\u2019t\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cWhy are you driving me crazy, I\u2019m asking you!\u201dKnowing that Inseop was unable to answer, Lee Wooyeon still insisted on an answer.\u201cAnswer me!\u00a0Choi Inseop!\u201dThe table shook with every shove.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s slender body was also struggling on it.\u00a0Because it was pitiful, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s anger against himself grew as well.\u00a0He felt like his head was going to explode.\u00a0He didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u00a0He just wanted to somehow have this, the one he has now.\u00a0He was out of breath.\u00a0His vision went white and he couldn\u2019t see anything.\u00a0Without a sense of reality, Lee Wooyeon bit his lips and moved his waist.While holding Inseop\u2019s ass, Lee Wooyeon ejaculated.\u00a0Semen and blood flowed between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0The inside was torn and blood was dripping from the inside.\u201cUgh\u2015\u2015, uh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Ugh..\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop\u2019s sobbing gradually made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s feelings subside.\u00a0Choi Inseop fell down and cried.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s vision became clearer and clearer.\u00a0The first thing that caught his eye was Inseop\u2019s trembling shoulder.\u201cInseop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon tried to grab Inseop\u2019s shoulder, Inseop was startled and leaned back.\u00a0In his face, which had turned white, Lee Wooyeon could see the fear.It was a familiar sight.\u00a0The gaze that was directed towards him as if he were looking at a disgusting monster.\u00a0It didn\u2019t matter how other people saw him.\u00a0Because they saw him as a monster, he didn\u2019t even think he needed to consider himself monsters.However, through the eyes of Choi Inseop, Lee Wooyeon realized that he was a monster.\u00a0It was exhausting, and his heart tightened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was perplexed because he did not know what this feeling of choking and tingling in his throat was.\u201cInseop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe reached out again and touched Choi Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0Inseop trembled and sobbed and cried.\u00a0Blood was still flowing between his buttocks.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon took off his shirt and wiped Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0He tried to support Inseop, who was crying, and take him to bed.\u201cDon, don\u2019t do it!\u201dInseop shouted.\u00a0In a voice full of resolute rejection and fear.\u201cDon\u2019t.\u00a0My, I\u2019m going\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s ripped.\u201dInseop pulled up his pants and got up with his shaky legs.\u00a0But he could not walk even a few steps and fell down..\u00a0Seeing this, Lee Wooyeon frowned as the pain in his chest that he felt earlier grew even worse.\u201cInseop.\u00a0I will support you.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u00a0\u2026 I will take care of it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please listen to me.\u201d\u201cLee Wooyeon, couldn\u2019t you listen to me first?\u201dTears welled up in Inseop\u2019s big eyes.\u00a0The documents Lee Dayoung gave him contained a copy of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s driver\u2019s license.\u00a0Seeing the date of birth written on it, Inseop doubted his own eyes.\u00a0It was because the birthday of Lee Wooyeon he knew was two months different.\u00a0Plus the birthday on paper was even today.Inseop, who was groaning alone, got dressed to go buy a cake.\u00a0It was still difficult to move, but he was able to get a car from a staff member he met in the elevator and rode it all the way downtown.\u00a0He went to the most famous cake shop in downtown Hawaii, waited an hour, and bought a cake and came back.\u00a0Since he bought a piece of cake from his money, he didn\u2019t even have the money to catch a taxi.\u00a0On the way to the hotel, he stopped in cold sweat several times and rested.\u00a0So he came back and waited for Lee Wooyeon, thinking about having a small birthday party together.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t think of a present, but he wanted to do something like this, so he gathered up the courage and made a plan to kiss him.\u00a0He sat in front of the door and waited for Lee Wooyeon with these thoughts.However, he was dragged into the room and, without listening, was forced by Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t even give him a chance to make an excuse.Inseop couldn\u2019t stop crying because of his sadness and fear.\u00a0He didn\u2019t like Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0He wanted to leave him, who was so violent and selfish, and to disappear.\u00a0Even so, his heart ached at the thought that those tender eyes looking at him might be real emotions.He liked Lee Wooyeon so much, and he hope that he will like him with similar feelings.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Inseop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon opened his mouth.\u00a0He reached out and hugged Inseop, but Inseop stubbornly refused.\u00a0Now, he did not want to surrender his emotions to Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hands.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Wait a minute and look at me\u00a0Okay?\u00a0Listen to me.\u201dLee Wooyeon leaned down and put his face under Choi Inseop\u2019s face and whispered softly.\u00a0Inseop reached out and pushed his shoulder.At that simple gesture, Lee Wooyeon was pushed back.\u00a0Standing one step away, Lee Wooyeon looked at Inseop.\u00a0Seeing that expression on his face that he didn\u2019t know what to do, Inseop\u2019s heart ached again.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I thought you were gone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI thought you ran away.\u201dLearn moreLee Wooyeon spit the words out from between his teeth.\u201cI heard that Lee Dayoung handed you the documents with a copy of your ID\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, I thought you were gone when I heard about it.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see it.\u00a0something like that\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop didn\u2019t even know that there was a copy of his ID in the document.\u00a0All he saw was Lee Wooyeon\u2019s driver\u2019s license.\u201cAn Asian person\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I went out after hearing that the person was stabbed with a knife.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, seeing the blood, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I kept looking for you.\u201dLee Wooyeon continued speaking with his head bowed.\u201cI couldn\u2019t find you so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I searched. I searched\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I looked for you, but I couldn\u2019t find you!\u201dUnable to contain his anger, Lee Wooyeon screamed and clenched his fists.\u00a0Just thinking that Choi Inseop had escaped his hand and disappeared was enough to make his body tremble.\u201cI kept looking.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI ran like crazy, grabbing people that looked like you, I ran and ran, but because Inseop wasn\u2019t there\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed his forehead with his hand.\u00a0He felt like his head was going to explode.\u00a0His heart throbbed again, and it tightened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was madly confused because he couldn\u2019t even tell if what he was feeling was an emotion or a physical change.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t swim, but he felt like he was thrown into the middle of the sea.It was daunting, dizzy, horribly, and confusing.Seeing a cold sweat running down Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead and his face pale, Inseop opened his eyes.\u201cWhy, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0are you like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t feel well.\u201dAfter saying that, Lee Wooyeon ran to the bathroom.\u00a0Hearing the sound of vomiting, Inseop was startled and frozen on the spot.It felt like it wasn\u2019t the Lee Wooyeon he knew.\u00a0It was strange.\u00a0He was not always a relaxed and confident man.\u00a0Who the hell was that man over there?Choi Inseop dragged his weak legs and walked to the bathroom.\u201cLee Wooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, are you okay?\u201dLee Wooyeon stood blankly, holding the wash basin with the water running.\u00a0Looking at his back, which was hardened like a stone, Inseop asked again with a worried voice.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Are you okay?\u00a0Wooyeon, are you okay\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dInseop grabbed his arm and looked at his face, then he was surprised.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was crying.\u00a0Tears were constantly flowing from Lee Wooyeon\u2019s blank eyes.\u201cOh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Should I call a doctor?\u00a0I will call the doctor.\u201dInseop shuddered and straightened his back.\u00a0His hands trembled at the thought that something was wrong.\u00a0He needed to find a phone first, which hospital was it, and what are the symptoms?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop from behind.\u00a0Inseop was startled by the damp feeling on the nape of his neck and thought that he should call the doctor right away.\u201cI will call the doctor.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u00a0I\u2019ll call the doctor\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0I\u2019ll bring a doctor.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry.\u00a0I\u2019ll go out\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dThe strength in the hand that was holding his shoulder got stronger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said in a low voice from behind, \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Fuck, don\u2019t go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh, Lee.

happen.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice mixed with crying reached Inseop.\u201cWhat should I do\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop looked back slowly.\u00a0He removed Lee Wooyeon from his body and looked at his face.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s unfamiliar face, which he had never seen in any other works or screens, stood there.He was afraid.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t stand the range of emotions he was feeling, and he was very afraid.\u00a0In that unusual appearance, Choi Inseop saw the human side of Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0So sweet and affectionate, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it was so damn goodInseop reached out and wiped Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon paused and looked at Inseop.\u00a0It was an empty, empty gaze.\u00a0As their eyes met, more and more emotions began to dwell in those eyes.Surprise and bewilderment, fear, relief, and greed.\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201dChoi Inseop said as if making a promise.\u201cI want to go, I want to go, \u2026\u00a0\u2026but\u00a0I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026Inseop.\u201d\u201cEven if this happened to Lee Wooyeon, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0You\u2019re so ugly and stupid, but you\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe may not have heard the last words.\u00a0The words were swallowed inward, as if rolling in his mouth.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop tightly as soon as his lips were closed.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Please tell me more.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cTell me you like me, and you won\u2019t go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I

\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I want to be with you if Lee Wooyeon feels the same way\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe thought the last word sounded sad.\u00a0It sounded like Lee Wooyeon would leave him if he hated him, and a sense of sadness came over him.\u00a0Inseop shed tears.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hand trembled as he embraced him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Inseop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201c\u2026ugh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m crazy, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t know if what I feel is the same as what Inseop feels.\u00a0What is certain is that \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I think I want Inseop to continue to like me.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s hand wiped Inseop\u2019s back.\u00a0As he kissed the nape of his neck, Lee Wooyeon let out the darkened emotions.\u201cI have lived a decent life with a broken head, \u2026\u00a0\u2026but\u00a0I think my heart was broken because of you.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s hot lips touched Inseop\u2019s cheeks, eyes, and forehead.\u00a0Inseop felt his whispered words being engraved into his skin.\u201cI think my heart broke when you rescued me from the lake.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cSo, take responsibility and stay by my side.\u201dLee Woo-yeon, who hugged Inseop, kissed him tenderly and whispered.\u00a0He ran down Inseop\u2019s mouth and licked his lips.\u00a0When Inseop exhaled and hugged Lee Wooyeon\u2019s neck, he smiled a little.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Why are you laughing?\u201d\u201cFuck, I must be crazy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cChoi Inseop makes me laugh when I hear the sound of you kissing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m crazy.\u00a0Sorry.\u00a0I will not blame Inseop for that.\u201dLee Wooyeon covered Inseop\u2019s face with his hands.\u00a0Then he pressed his lips to his forehead and muttered.\u201cIf Inseop abandons me, he might see me on the 9 o\u2019clock news instead of on an entertainment program.\u201dHe kissed Inseop\u2019s crown.\u00a0Both in the hair and in the earlobes.\u00a0He raised his hand and kissed each finger.\u201cWhen you, really, hate it so much that you can\u2019t stand it, then just kill me.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOtherwise, I might have to kill Mr. Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that.\u00a0Ever, I don\u2019t want to.\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t get over this feeling he felt today.\u00a0He opened Inseop\u2019s lips and kissed him.\u00a0He put his tongue in his hot mouth and moved.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body warmed up little by little at the feeling of being alive inside Choi Inseop.\u201cha\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon gently rubbed Inseop\u2019s waist and exhaled a hot breath.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face reddened at the firm touch from below.\u00a0In fact, from before, Inseop felt it below.\u00a0He desperately pulled his waist back, not wanting to be found out, but Lee Wooyeon blatantly rubbed it.\u201cInseop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon called out his name in a desperate voice.\u201cInseop, Choi

happened just before, Lee Wooyeon was unable to express his desires first.\u00a0He swept down Inseop\u2019s hips and waist with his hand, calling out Inseop\u2019s name sweetly as if it would melt.\u201cInseop, \u2026\u00a0\u2026Inseop, Inseop\u2026\u00a0.\u201dJust hearing his voice relieved Inseop\u2019s strength in his legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hot voice constantly called out Inseop.\u201cInseop, Inseop.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop.\u201dChoi Inseop hugged Lee Wooyeon\u2019s neck and whispered softly.\u201cLet\u2019s go to

Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s pants and put his hand on the inside of his thigh and said.\u201cInseop, I want to touch your cock.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cPlease allow me.\u201dInseop wanted to cry.\u00a0He thought it would be better to touch it without asking for permission.\u00a0He wanted to ask how he can spit out vulgar words in such a respectful tone.\u201cInseop.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dWhen Inseop bit his lip and didn\u2019t say anything, Lee Wooyeon called Inseop in an anxious voice.\u00a0Inseop answered while covering his eyes with the back of his hand.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Touch me.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s hand ruffled his underwear.\u00a0He pushed away the cloth and pulled out the flesh that was nestled in it.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked, fiddling with it between his fingers.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cJust do it!\u201dChoi Inseop shouted.\u00a0His face was getting even redder.\u00a0Inseop said with tears in his eyes.\u201cDo it, do it all.\u00a0It\u2019s good so just do it.\u00a0Please, don\u2019t ask me, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, do whatever you like.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Is that okay?\u201dInseop lowered his head, covering his face with his hands.\u00a0He was ashamed to death.\u00a0He thought it would be nice if someone could cover Lee Wooyeon\u2019s mouth.\u201cCan I hug Inseop?\u201d\u201cContinue, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0doing what\u2026.you want.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0You\u2019ve been doing that since the beginning, you\u2019ve always been like that.\u201dInseop stuttered in a trembling voice.\u201cAnyway, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Go on, it\u2019s okay because I liked Lee Wooyeon.\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t help but suppress the hot feeling that filled his heart.He pulled down Inseop\u2019s underwear and took off his clothes himself.\u00a0The two quickly became naked and hugged each other.Lee Wooyeon poured kisses on Inseop\u2019s face and neck.\u00a0At the same time, he kept rubbing him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon whispered in Inseop\u2019s ear and told him to tell him when he was ready.He started from Inseop\u2019s shoulder and then touched the nape of his neck, chest, and waist.\u00a0He licked it with his tongue to taste it, and he bit him to make a slight bite mark.Seeing Inseop\u2019s cock gradually getting hard and taking shape, Lee Wooyeon stretched out his hand.\u00a0When he grabbed it and glanced over it, Inseop arched his back and let out a moan.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cYou know what?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cInseop\u2019s cock, it looks really cute.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cShape and color.\u00a0It looks really tasty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Can you not say that?\u201dInseop cried and asked.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon smiled and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Aren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed.\u00a0He pointed his finger at his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Because I don\u2019t have that concept.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I am.\u201d\u201cThen I want to know, too, so you should tell me that too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not, it\u2019s just that if you don\u2019t do it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s glans with the tip of his finger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon brought his mouth down.\u00a0He opened his mouth and sucked Inseop\u2019s with his mouth.\u00a0Inseop gasped.While sucking it, he moved his tongue, and Inseop shook his head.\u00a0It was a beautiful chest that fluttered up and down.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon touched Inseop\u2019s nipples with his hands.\u00a0After a while, Inseop\u2019s breathing became rough and his waist began to gain strength.\u201cWoo, Wooyeon, I, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Ah, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0no\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe pushed Lee Wooyeon away with his feet, but he did not move and sucked him harder.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dInseop\u2019s toes curled.\u00a0His waist was arched upward as he was soaring with the rushing lust.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon frowned.\u201cMmm, did\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you swallow\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cIt tastes like this.\u00a0It\u2019s not very pleasant.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u00a0why\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cInseop ate my cum deliciously, so I tried it-, it\u2019s not bad.\u201dLee Wooyeon muttered, wiping the semen off his lips with his fingers.\u00a0Choi Inseop raised a pillow and covered his face.\u00a0When he thought that Lee Wooyeon had swallowed his own semen, he didn\u2019t have the confidence to open his eyes and look at him.\u201cMr. Inseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon pulled down the pillow and called him.\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cShow me your face.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Because I want to see that I am having sex with Choi Inseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon moved Inseop\u2019s hand away.\u00a0Looking at his still swollen wrists, Lee Wooyeon muttered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0I will never do anything to hurt you again.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed bitterly as he spit out words he had never genuinely said before.\u201cHowever, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It\u2019s not like that below.\u201dEven though he didn\u2019t touch it, Lee Wooyeon was hard, revealing its presence.\u00a0Inseop recognized the meaning of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words and blushed.\u00a0The inside had been torn from being forced.\u00a0When he thought that he would be accepting something inside, Inseop\u2019s face hardened.\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked, fumbling between Inseop\u2019s buttocks.Learn more\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0little.\u201d\u201cI want to put it in\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but I can\u2019t.\u201dLee Wooyeon muttered in an anxious voice and narrowed the corners of his eyes.\u00a0Inseop could clearly read the desire that flashed in his eyes.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s heart was pounding as the ferocious beast looked at his own eyes while suppressing his desires.Ah, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Maybe he was just so stupid.\u00a0Even if he changed his name from Choi Inseop to Choi Fool, he would have nothing to say.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0put it in.\u201dInseop muttered in a small voice.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Put it in.\u201d\u201cWhat, where do I put it?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.\u00a0At that teasing tone, Inseop realized that he had been teased again and turned his head.\u201cIf you don\u2019t know, don, don\u2019t.\u201dLee Wooyeon bit Inseop\u2019s ear slightly and released it.\u00a0He said, slowly licking the ear with his tongue.\u201cAre you saying that I can put my cock in Mr. Inseop\u2019s hole?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cJust nod your head.\u201dAs Inseop nodded slightly, Lee Wooyeon put his hand under Inseop\u2019s waist and turned around.\u00a0With his hips raised, Inseop thought he was lucky not to be able to see his face and buried his head.\u201c\u2015\u2015!\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for that happy thought to disappear from his mind.\u201cWha, what\u2013!\u201d\u201cI have to loosen it.\u00a0No more tearing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s, dirty\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ugh.\u201dIt was difficult for Inseop to accept that he put his mouth in such a place.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon laughed.\u201cThere are people who want to eat that dirty place, all the time, just thinking about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to get into it somehow, I feel like I\u2019m going crazy.\u201dLee Wooyeon made Inseop lie down again.\u00a0As Inseop twisted his back, he tried to stop Lee Wooyeon from licking it, but Lee Wooyeon held him tight.\u00a0His tongue started licking between Inseop\u2019s ass again.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0no\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Ha, don\u2019t\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dAs the moist tongue licked the wrinkles and entered the hole, Inseop shook his head and bit his lip.\u00a0It felt as shameful as death.\u00a0It felt so terrifying yet he was hard without even touching it.\u00a0Inseop leaned down and pressed his dick on the sheet in order for Lee Wooyeon to not notice it.\u00a0However, Inseop instinctively moved his waist and rubbed the bottom due to the intense pleasure that came from behind.\u201cOh, uh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, uh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2015\u2015.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do it alone.\u201dLee Wooyeon bit Inseop\u2019s buttocks slightly and said.\u201cCum with me.\u00a0A little bit more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cJust\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0put it in.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll hurt.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, do it.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0please.\u201dThe one word \u2018please\u2019 cut off Lee Wooyeon\u2019s reasoning.\u00a0He grabbed his cock that had been pulled so painfully from before, and placed it between Inseop\u2019s buttocks.\u00a0Putting the tip of the glans between the buttocks and applying force, the hole opened with a pop.\u201cUgh.\u201dLee Wooyeon tried to insert it as slowly as he could.\u00a0The hand that was holding his body trembled as he was barely holding back what he wanted to push.A cold sweat ran down Lee Wooyeon\u2019s back.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s forehead was also wet with sweat.\u00a0Inseop grabbed the sheet at the tingling sensation that pushed him up and down.Slowly, very slowly, Lee Wooyeon pushed himself body in.\u00a0Rather, the slowness made Inseop more aware.\u201cAh\u2013!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not even halfway in yet.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, Inseop almost burst into tears.\u00a0It felt like it took half a day to come in.\u00a0He wished he would enter inside sooner rather than later\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0hurry\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cPut\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please put it in faster\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Rather, it is\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dHe was glad he didn\u2019t end up saying it would be better.\u00a0Inseop opened his mouth and let out a silent scream at the sensation of his genitals rushing in.\u201cWhy\u2026\u00a0\u2026are you arousing me like that.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ooh, Wooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doing it nicely, as much as possible!\u201dEvery time Lee Wooyeon cut off his words, he moved his waist .\u201cSo, you say that, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0How can I be patient?\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ah ah!\u00a0Wai, wai\u2026wait!\u201dLee Wooyeon stopped moving and turned Inseop\u2019s body to face him.\u00a0Inseop, who was gasping for breath, blinked and looked at Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon also looked down at Inseop.\u00a0His eyes glistened with lust cast a greedy gaze.Lee Wooyeon swung his waist and pulled him up.\u00a0Inseop gasped, and let out a moan.\u00a0Unsatisfied with that voice, Lee Wooyeon moved his waist again.\u00a0Every time he pushed his waist up, a shrill moan erupted from Inseop\u2019s mouth.\u201cAhhh!\u00a0hu\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, uh!\u00a0Ah!\u201d\u201cDo you like me?\u201d\u201cAhhh!Slow, slowly\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, wai\u2026t!\u201d\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to die, damn it, Inseop, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0do you like me?\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s breathing became rough.\u00a0Seeing Inseop clinging to his arm and moaning while crying, Wooyeon became crazy excited.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon bent down and placed his body on Inseop\u2019s body.\u00a0As he moved his waist with his body closely overlapped, Inseop\u2019s genitals rubbed against Lee Wooyeon\u2019s stomach.\u201cTell me you like me.\u201dLee Wooyeon hugged Inseop and said that.\u00a0Inseop answered in a voice that seemed to run out of breath.\u201cI, I like you\u2014Ah, I like you\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ah, uhh, Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cSay it more, more, more.\u201dThe penis dug into the hole without a single gap.\u00a0As if a wound had been opened, a burning pain was transmitted from below, but rather than that, the sensation that this man was running wild in his body with excitement could not help Inseop come to his senses.Inseop spread his legs as wide as he could to help Lee Wooyeon enter deeper.\u00a0A hard penis pounded, rubbed, and pounded against the inner wall.\u00a0Inseop cried and told Lee Wooyeon that he liked him several times.\u00a0Each time, Lee Wooyeon entered him back even harder.\u201cI like you\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Ah!\u00a0Ah\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ah!!\u00a0I like\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Wooyeon!!\u201d\u201cKeep saying it.\u00a0Inseop, every time you say that, I feel like my dick is going to burn, so keep telling me.\u201d\u201cAh!\u00a0Ha, ha, I like you\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Wooyeon, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop clung to Lee Wooyeon as he spit out a mess of confessions and moans.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s straight face was stained with desire.\u201cInseop, Inseop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ha, so delicious, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m going crazy.\u00a0Is Inseop liking it too?\u201d\u201cYes, ah!Ah\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, aah, Wooyeon, I, I!\u201dInseop\u2019s cock, which was very hard as it was rubbing against Lee Wooyeon\u2019s hard stomach, twitched.\u00a0It was gradually approaching its climax.\u00a0Inseop clung to Lee Wooyeon and moved his waist.\u00a0The image of him moving his waist with a shy expression on his face ignited the last fire of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s desire.He moaned and lifted his back.\u00a0When Inseop, who reached his climax first, ejaculated, hot semen was sprayed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon immediately slammed his waist and trembled at the feeling of tightness underneath.\u00a0The warm semen spread through Inseop\u2019s body. Lee Wooyeon\u2019s cum inside him dripped down as his hole twitched.\u201cHa\u2026ha\u2026\u00a0\u201dHe exhaled the breath he had been holding back and relaxed his body.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon also caught his breath and got up.\u00a0The cum that had been on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s stomach fell on Inseop\u2019s body.The sensation of evoked a shame that had been forgotten.\u00a0As he descended, Inseop\u2019s eyelashes trembled.Lee Wooyeon asked, stroking Inseop\u2019s hair.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not sick?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t painful, it was so good that I was about to run out of breath.\u00a0Unable to say such a thing, Inseop hardened his expression and kept his mouth shut, while Lee Wooyeon frowned.\u00a0He hesitated and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Inseop.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were sick.\u201d\u201cAh no\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s lips touched Inseop\u2019s cheek.\u00a0And he whispered sorry again.\u00a0Every time his lips brushed against his cheek, he felt a tickling sensation, and Inseop burst into laughter without realizing it.\u00a0With a smile, he gently pushed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s tickling\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dWith smiling eyes, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes met his.\u00a0At that moment, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face changed color subtly, so much that one wouldn\u2019t notice it unless they paid close attention and looked at it.Inseop blinked his eyes, wondering if he had seen it wrong, and checked Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face again.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was looking down at him with a normal face.\u201cInseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cCan you smile a little more?\u201dLee Wooyeon traced Inseop\u2019s lips and eyes with his fingers.\u201cI thought you were pretty when you cried, but \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0You look prettier when you smile.\u201dAt those words, Inseop\u2019s face turned red at once.\u00a0Heat rose from his face and even the breath he exhaled warmed up.More, smile.Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop and whispered.\u00a0Now, smile.\u00a0Inseop.For some reason, those words that touched his heart broke his heart, and Inseop bowed his head and shed tears.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clenched his lips and hugged Inseop.\u201cI will correct it.\u00a0No matter what you do, you\u2019re pretty, just stay by my side.\u201dInseop hugged him and nodded his head.\u00a0The only option he could choose was that from the beginning.The long kiss between the two began again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No right?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have time to do it. I just pushed him. A bit.\u201d\u201cWhat will you do if he sues you?\u201d\u201cBlock it with money.\u00a0CEO, what are you going to do with your money? I\u2019m sure some money came in because your stock exchange went well.\u201dCEO Kim was on the verge of foaming.\u00a0Manager Cha, who was driving, opened his mouth to help with a word before CEO Kim died like this.\u201cEven so, there are so many people who saw you, right?\u00a0What were you thinking?\u201d\u201cI know, right.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and nodded.\u00a0In fact, the memories of that time were sparse.\u00a0He was so angry that he couldn\u2019t even remember what he was doing.\u00a0His only thought was only that Choi Inseop had left him and disappeared and he had to find him.\u201cWhat is going\u2026\u2026on?\u201dInseop, who had not heard of the details that day, pointed to a picture of Lee Wooyeon in the newspaper and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u00a0You have nothing to worry about.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing!\u00a0Hey, two CFs already canceled on you.\u201d\u201cOnly cut two?\u00a0I guess it\u2019s true that people should accumulate virtues on a daily basis.\u00a0That\u2019s fortunate.\u201dCEO Kim took a deep breath and grabbed the back of his neck.\u00a0Manager Cha asked him if he had taken his Blood Pressure medication.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Are you going to quit being a celebrity?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why?

If Lee Wooyeon went wild, you should have stopped it by any means possible.\u00a0I\u2019ll let it go for now until this mess goes down.\u201dLee Wooyeon, who had been smilin,, called out to him, \u201cCEO.\u201d\u201cWhat\u201d\u201cMr. Inseop was not there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m scolding him!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tired because I just got off the plane. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d\u201cWhen is later.\u00a0I have to finish talking after Kim has spoken.\u00a0Inseop, if you want to work with him in the future\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cCEO Kim.\u201dRecognizing that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice calling to him was unusual, CEO Kim turned around in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s me who\u2019s wrong, so just scold me.\u00a0Inseop, just leave him alone.\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0Because I was away, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0sorry.\u201d\u201cSince Inseop has nothing to be sorry about, stay still.\u00a0The president knows that too.\u201dHis tone was serious, but his voice was sharp and cold.\u00a0CEO Kim, who knew that Lee Wooyeon was not the type of person who cared about anyone, looked at him with a face saying, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u00a0He didn\u2019t think he was joking\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0no way.CEO Kim looked at Choi Inseop and Lee Wooyeon with eyes full of astonishment.\u00a0Inseop was looking out the window, and Lee Wooyeon was reading a newspaper with rumors of him taking drugs with a relaxed face as usual.All of a sudden, he called him father\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, that can\u2019t be.\u00a0That guy loved women too much.CEO Kim got rid of the useless thoughts that ran through his head and turned his body forward.\u00a0How far did he run?\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon told Inseop to sleep while leaning on him, CEO Kim was startled and looked back again.\u201cWhat?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked.\u00a0His face was so gentle and peaceful, he couldn\u2019t help but utter the thoughts that ran through his head.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It is nothing.\u201dFirst of all, these were people who have come back from a long way, so he thought of leaving it as it is for now.\u00a0For the time being, there won\u2019t be any problems.\u00a0Working hard to make up his mind, CEO Kim straightened his body.However, his anxious heart fluctuated inside him like he had motion sickness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

joke.\u00a0Since it\u2019s Inseop\u2019s flowerpot, I will treat it with respect.\u201dLee Wooyeon said so and kissed Inseop\u2019s lips.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon, who kissed his lips a few more times, said, \u201cFuck,\u201d and pulled his face back.\u201cI can\u2019t.\u00a0If I do it any longer, I\u2019ll really want to skip the recording.\u00a0I\u2019ll be back, so take Kate and come here.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dInseop did not want to show that he felt regretful and affectionate the moment Lee Wooyeon\u2019s lips moved away, so he worked hard to answer.\u201cGoodbye.\u201dLee Wooyeon took Inseop\u2019s hand and said.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I like you.\u00a0Mr. Lee Wooyeon.\u201dThis was something that Inseop always told Lee Wooyeon, as if he was always determined before parting.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon said, \u201cHmm,\u201d and made a face.\u201cI\u2019m still not convinced.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to convince you anyway.\u201d\u201cSomeday I will be convinced.\u00a0Other than that, let\u2019s be confident.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cGo quickly.\u00a0Before the air gets hotter.\u201dSaying that, Lee Wooyeon opened the car door.\u201cGo right away.\u00a0The more I see you, the more I don\u2019t want to send you.\u00a0You go and come right back.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dAfter watching Lee Wooyeon waving and disappearing, Inseop got into the driver\u2019s seat.\u00a0After stopping by the office for some work, he got into the car and went to his place of residence.\u00a0When he saw the town he lived in a long time ago, he had a strange feeling.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t get up to the top by car because of the uphill road, so he parked his car in a nearby vacant lot.\u00a0It was sparse and quiet, and not knowing what might happen at night, he always parked it in the office, but he thought that it might not matter since it is daytime now.He walked up the hill and climbed up to the roof of the house he lived in.\u00a0He cleared his throat and went up to the roof, wondering if he would be surprised if someone lived in the rooftop room.\u00a0Fortunately or unfortunately, the rooftop room did not seem to be occupied.\u201cThere it is!\u201dInseop found a flowerpot lying in the corner of the roof and ran over excitedly.\u00a0The leaves were a bit damaged due to rain and wind, but they were still fresh.\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201dInseop went down the stairs to the roof, hugging the flowerpot.\u00a0On the way to the place where the car was parked, looking at the flowers blooming everywhere, Inseop thought that it was now spring.As he was always going to and from home, parking lot, broadcasting station, parking lot, house, and office, there was no time to feel the change of seasons.Wait, there was no schedule after this for Lee Wooyeon today.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It will end early, so he decided to go see flowers together.\u00a0But he might be tired\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Maybe he should prepare a packed lunch and drive.\u00a0If he asks him to go, he\u2019ll go.\u00a0What should he prepare lunch with?His steps were light as he was thinking about various things.\u00a0When he arrived at the place where he parked the car, Inseop opened his mouth.Again.\u00a0Another white letter lay on the windshield of the van.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe thought this was a bit serious.\u00a0Wherever he went these days, there was a letter on the windshield of the car, so Inseop seriously suggested to Lee Wooyeon that he should talk to the CEO or the manager.\u00a0However, Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t care, saying that this was not a big deal.Still, how come they follow him wherever he goes every time?Learn moreInseop sighed and took the letter out of the glass and put it in his pocket.\u00a0Then he heard a car door closing behind me.The woman he had seen before was staring at Inseop with a terrifying face.\u00a0She once failed to pour coffee on Lee Wooyeon and spilled it on him instead, and he tried to remember the name of the woman who spilled coffee on him.\u201cYou\u2019re taking away the letter everyday.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cEvery time I watched, you took it.\u00a0I\u2019ve never seen Lee Wooyeon oppa take it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon looked at the letter, all he said was to throw it away, burn it, and tear it apart.\u00a0It was only natural for Inseop to take the letter because he couldn\u2019t throw away the fan letter in front of people.\u201cAre you always intercepting my letters in the middle?\u201d\u201cNo.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon goes home and reads it.\u201dInseop lied.\u201cThen why is there no reply?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he\u2019s busy\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDo not lie!\u00a0Last time he went to the cinema to see a movie!\u00a0Being busy is all a lie!\u00a0You are intercepting everything!\u201dInseop instinctively sensed that the woman\u2019s condition was not normal, and retreated.\u201cNo.\u00a0That never happened.\u201d\u201cI saw an article in which my oppa said he would always receive postcards from his first love.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dIt seems that the talk they had at the party that day spread and became an article.\u201cObviously he read my letter and said that \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Then I\u2019m his first love, so why doesn\u2019t he reply to me?\u00a0It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u00a0I think you have a misunderstanding\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dAmong the fanatical fans, this delusion was too much, believing it to be a reality, and there were often people who went crazy.\u00a0Knowing that such extreme cases would lead to tragic results, Inseop tried to persuade her as calmly as possible.\u201cFor now, go home.\u00a0later I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cNo, not what!\u00a0What misunderstanding?\u00a0You\u2019re doing this by intercepting all of oppa\u2019s letters right now!\u00a0I have seen you put my letter in your pocket more than once!!\u201dA ferocious madness flashed in the woman\u2019s eyes.\u00a0Watching her eyes move rapidly side to side, she was not in a state where she could communicate.Inseop thought it was better to avoid this than to talk to her, so he opened the car door.\u00a0He shoved Kate into the passenger seat and stepped onto the car.At that moment, Inseop felt something cold creeping up near his waist.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201dWhen he tried to turn around without understanding the situation, it slipped again, and sharp metal stabbed him in the waist.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0wha\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOppa and I are in love with each other, but who are you that interferes with that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dChoi Inseop pressed his back with his hand to check.\u00a0There was red blood on the palm of his hand.\u201cI will kill you!\u201dShe raised her knife again.\u00a0Inseop desperately reached out and took the knife.\u00a0When the knife was taken away, the woman flashed and ran towards him.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t normal.\u00a0Inseop managed to push the woman away and got into the car.\u00a0Even while the car door was closed, the woman reached out and ripped Inseop\u2019s clothes.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know how he closed the door and left.\u00a0Inseop stepped on the accelerator, leaving behind the woman who was screaming at him.He felt a burning pain in his back.\u00a0It hurt so badly that he was in a cold sweat and his hands and feet were shaking.\u201cHospital\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop thought he needed to find a nearby hospital and pressed the navigation with his blood-stained finger.\u00a0As he moved, blood rushed out and wet the seat.\u00a0It felt like the sensation was slowly disappearing on his legs.Inseop grabbed the steering wheel.\u00a0For the first time, he thought that he could die like this.\u00a0When he got on the operating table, he was under anesthesia, so after waking up, he felt vaguely as if it were someone else.\u201cHa ha\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dNow it was definitely felt.\u00a0That he could really die.His vision was blurred and his body trembled.\u00a0Inseop found his cell phone and called Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Of course, the power was turned off because he was recording.\u00a0Crying, he felt nauseous.Inseop grabbed the steering wheel and his body shook.\u00a0He had to go to the hospital, but\u2026\u00a0Then when he dies\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0he will never see Lee Wooyeon again\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0What if he thought he ran away again\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0he hated it, but he haven\u2019t been convinced yet\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.Inseop turned the steering wheel of the car.\u00a0After seeing Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face somehow, he will go to the hospital.\u00a0Besides, the place where the recording is located is not far from here, and the hospital is closeby\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, yes, it\u2019s on the way, so he could stop by for a moment\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.Inseop checked the time.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon will be waiting for him in the parking lot, so all he had to do is talk and go to the hospital.\u00a0If he goes to the hospital\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I might die\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop, startled by the sudden mumble, shook his head.\u00a0He will live\u00a0It\u2019s the heart that Jennie gave him, and he was barely able to heal and live, but he can\u2019t die like this.\u00a0If he dies without any word, Lee Wooyeon will think that he has left him and ran away again.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want Lee Wooyeon to live in a mental hospital for the rest of his life.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0More than anything.\u2018I want to see that person.\u00a0I, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u2018I miss you.\u2019\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop gave strength to the hand holding the steering wheel and stepped on the accelerator.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

eyes.\u00a0Even blinking was difficult, so the speed at which he lifted his eyelids gradually slowed down.\u00a0Thinking he must be very tired, Lee Wooyeon thought that he had to drive today.\u201cI will drive today.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0The driver\u2019s seat\u00a0\u2026it got very dirty\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the driver\u2019s seat that\u2019s dirty, it\u2019s the back seat.\u00a0It\u2019s okay.\u00a0You can leave the car at the car wash later.\u201dChoi Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon with blurry eyes and smiled faintly.\u201cI love you\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if you would believe it, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cI want to say that too, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I will tell you when I know for sure what my heart is.\u201dSaying that, Lee Wooyeon pressed the area near his chest with his palm.\u00a0When he heard Choi Inseop\u2019s confession, his heart started pounding even more than before.\u201cEven if there are similar feelings\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a similar feeling, hahaha.\u201dLee Wooyeon reached out and wiped Inseop\u2019s cheek, but stopped in surprise at the ice-cold touch, and his expression hardened.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Why is your body\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThen he looked at Inseop\u2019s body, which was leaning on the car.\u00a0Blood soaked under the legs and pooled on the seat.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was surprised and opened the driver\u2019s seat door.Choi Inseop\u2019s body fell helplessly towards Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWhat is this?\u00a0Inseop, wait, what is this?\u201dA siren sounded from the entrance to the parking lot.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon realized the meaning when Inseop said that the car will come soon.\u201cInseop, Inseop.\u00a0Why are you here?\u00a0Fuck, who did this\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Wait.\u00a0Inseop!\u201dLee Wooyeon grabbed Inseop\u2019s shoulder and shouted.\u00a0Inseop blinked his eyes.He wanted to see Lee Wooyeon\u2019s face more, but his eyes were so heavy that his vision kept getting blurry.\u00a0He wanted to smile, but his face didn\u2019t listen.\u201cChoi Inseop!\u00a0Inseop!\u00a0Hey!\u00a0Choi Inseop!!!!\u00a0Open your eyes!\u00a0Damn it, Inseop!!\u201dLee Wooyeon screamed and called out his name.\u00a0Inseop put his hand on the hand that was holding his shoulder, and whispered, \u201cI like you.\u201d\u00a0Inseop closed his eyes, thinking that his lips seemed to have moved, but he didn\u2019t know if he heard the words.The siren sound got closer, but Inseop\u2019s ears couldn\u2019t hear anything anymore.The faces of CEO Kim and Manager Cha, who were sitting in front of the operating room, were dark.\u00a0On the electronic board in front of the operating room, only the words \u201cin surgery\u201d were written, but there was no news yet.They were worried about Inseop, who was undergoing major surgery in the operating room, but CEO Kim was left restless because of Lee Wooyeon, who was sitting next to him.\u00a0When he heard the news and rushed to the hospital, CEO Kim saw the scene.The scene in which Lee Wooyeon, who was soaked in blood, went crazy\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0It was not a horror movie.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon\u2019s eyes turned over when the doctor said that if the patient suddenly lost a lot of blood, he could die of shock.\u00a0He cut his wrist by grabbing whatever he could get, and then he shouted, \u201cYou can take my blood and use it.\u201d\u00a0Everyone who saw him turned white.\u00a0A nurse and a doctor ran and grabbed his arm and tried to stop the bleeding, and the blood from his wrist splattered on the walls of the white hospital.In order to calm Lee Wooyeon, three injections of tranquilizers and sleeping pills were given.\u00a0Even though he was given enough drugs to make an ordinary person faint, Lee Wooyeon went to Inseop.\u00a0Two male nurses, CEO Kim, and manager Cha rushed at him and barely managed to make him lie on the bed.\u00a0Shortly thereafter, when he fell asleep because of the drug, CEO Kim thought that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s image was over.However, the problem did not end there, either.\u00a0After talking with the police who came to hear about the situation, he was sitting in front of the operating room with Manager Cha, when Lee Wooyeon appeared.\u00a0When CEO Kim found Lee Wooyeon, who appeared in front of the operating room barefoot without a single word, he was so scared that he felt faint.\u00a0After saying he will wait patiently, Lee Wooyeon sat down next to CEO Kim.\u00a0Neither Manger Cha nor CEO Kim could tell him to go back to the hospital.And by the third hour, they were still in front of the operating room.\u00a0Every time Lee Wooyeon sighed, the two of them shuddered and shook their shoulders.Even though he wanted to go to the bathroom, he did not know how Lee Wooyeon would change in the meantime, so CEO Kim was barely holding back.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0How is it?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe police\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0What did they say?\u201dLee Wooyeon, who had been burying his emaciated face in his hands for several hours, asked.\u00a0CEO Kim hesitated for a moment and then looked at Manager Cha.\u00a0Manager Cha began to explain calmly.\u201cThe culprit hasn\u2019t been caught yet, but the knife found in the car has fingerprints on it, so they will be caught soon.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0worry?\u201dLee Wooyeon raised his face.\u00a0A cold chill crept into his eyes.\u201cWorry?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t worry?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I mean, of course, you should be worried about Mr. Inseop.\u00a0Let\u2019s all worry together so that the surgery can be successful\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWorry?\u00a0Do I look like I\u2019m sitting here worrying?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt feels like my heart is going to burn, and it feels like someone is stabbing me in the head with a knife with every breath I take, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Is this just a feeling of concern?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, no, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0You\u2019d better lie down.\u201d\u201cIf I lay down, do you think I will be different now?\u201dLee Wooyeon put his hands together again and buried his face on it.\u00a0He thought he was going to die.\u00a0His hands trembled at the thought that he might never see Inseop again.This time, really, he got to touch Choi Inseop\u2019s blood with his own hands.\u00a0Even if he tried to think that it would be okay, the sticky blood that had been soaked in the car\u2019s seat came to mind, and he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.If he had known it would be like this, he would not have sent him there, but if he had known it would be like this,he would have told him that they would go to America next week.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Were they really on the same page?\u00a0Is Choi Inseop, like him, looking at him with a desperate mind?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He hoped not.\u00a0He wished it wasn\u2019t.\u00a0He hoped Inseop was not feeling this feeling that made it difficult to even breathe because it felt like someone had broken his heart and lit it on fire.Lee Wooyeon took a deep breath.\u00a0Even now, he wanted to go inside and check if Choi Inseop was okay.\u00a0He wanted to hug Inseop and shout at him to open his eyes.\u00a0The urge to get confirmation that Choi Inseop is safe pounded his entire body.\u00a0He was sweating profusely with the pressure.He wiped his face with his palm.\u00a0Looking at the clock, he couldn\u2019t tell how much time had passed.\u00a0Every time he heard a small sound, he wondered if that was the sound of Inseop\u2019s cries, and his hearing grew sharp.\u201cWooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you go and get some rest. Please.\u00a0Otherwise, you\u2019ll collapse too.\u201dCEO Kim said, holding Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder carefully.\u00a0No matter how bad-tempered he was, because of someone else, Lee Wooyeon had such a miserable appearance, so he had felt bad.\u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d\u201cwe don\u2019t know when the surgery will end\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThen the door to the operating room opened and a tired doctor came out.\u00a0The three got up and went to the doctor.\u201cIs he okay?\u201d\u201cHow is he?\u00a0How is he?\u201dWhile the two of them asked, Lee Wooyeon kept his mouth shut and stood silently, waiting for the doctor\u2019s words.\u201cWell, the hard part is now over, but did you know that the patient had a weak heart?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0I mean\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI knew.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon answered, CEO Kim and Manager Cha looked back at him with surprised eyes.\u201cTo put it simply, it was very dangerous because the heart function was lower than that of other people.\u00a0A person like that can die instantly on the spot when a shock comes, even though an ordinary person can tolerate it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Anyway, luckily, he\u2019s safe now.\u00a0For now, he is recovering in the recovery room, but we have to keep an eye on him, and for the time being, absolutely, do not do anything that is too strenuous.\u00a0Ever.\u201dThe doctor gave strength to the words \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d and sighed.\u00a0The doctor, completely exhausted from the long operation time, said goodbye and left the room.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It\u2019s a million blessings.\u201dCEO Kim, who lost strength in his legs, sat down.\u00a0Manager Cha said the same thing, and nodded his head.\u00a0Only Lee Wooyeon stood in front of the operating room door and looked at the slowly closed door.\u201cNow don\u2019t worry too much.\u00a0The surgery went well, so if he just recovers\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cAs long as he recovers, it\u2019s over.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf there is a shock, he can die on the spot.\u201d\u201cIt is possible.\u00a0But doctors always like to say the worst.\u201dLee Wooyeon lowered his head.\u00a0Rather than the fact that Inseop was alive, the fact that something like this could happen again in the future strained his heart.Lee Wooyeon, who stood silently for a long time, seemed to have finally made up his mind, and called CEO Kim.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Inseop wanted to hug him, but he couldn\u2019t even lift his fingertips.He couldn\u2019t.\u00a0He wanted to say he was fine, and not to worry.\u00a0He should tell him before he goes, before he leaves the room.\u00a0He had to open his eyes\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.In the distant consciousness, Inseop was sad to hear the sound of the hospital door closing.\u00a0He came back to his senses two days later.Until he was discharged from the hospital ten days later, Lee Wooyeon did not come to visit him.\u00a0Inseop looked at the flower pots placed by the window of the hospital room, and realized that the words he had left that night were goodbyes.\u201cOkay. Your\u00a0body is healthy.\u00a0It feels really bad to have to go back to something like this.\u201dManager Cha who came out to meet him patted Inseop on the shoulder.\u201cI\u2019m dine.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry that I only bothered you.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0How many times did I go to the hospital\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d<Peter!\u00a0Come quickly\u00a0It\u2019s time to go.><I\u2019ll be there soon.\u00a0Please wait a little.>When English came out of Inseop\u2019s mouth casually, the manager closed his mouth tight.\u00a0Even though he had seen this scene several times in the hospital room, he couldn\u2019t help but feel awkward and strange.\u201cThen after going back to America, what are you going to do next?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019ll try to relax and think.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you coming back to Korea?\u201dInseop opened his eyes slightly at that question and said, \u201cWell,\u201d blurring the end of his words.\u00a0Later, while listening to the nurses talking to each other, Inseop realized that Lee Wooyeon had started another riot.Hot news swept the entertainment industry.\u00a0As Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager was attacked by a stalker, social voices demanded that the law against stalkers be re-enacted.\u00a0There was a warm article about Lee Wooyeon crying and clinging to a doctor for his manager whose life was in danger because of him, but this time the backstory was ugly because there were so many people who saw him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was so insane that day as he made a riot and the nurses whispered to each other that just looking at Lee Wooyeon gave them goosebumps.Lee Wooyeon did not appear until Choi Inseop was discharged from the hospital.\u00a0As Inseop, who knew what that meant, he could not say that he would come back to Korea willingly.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t come to work, just come and play.\u00a0If you come to play and call me, I will give you a place to stay and feed you.\u00a0For now\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Because I\u2019m Lee Wooyeon\u2019s manager, I\u2019m going to get a lot of bonuses.\u201dThe expression on the manager\u2019s face when he said that was very complicated.\u00a0It was sad to send Inseop like this, but he was also happy to receive the bonus, and even despairing as he took on the role of Lee Wooyeon, so his feelings had no choice but to be complicated.\u201cInseop!\u201dCEO Kim, who ran to the airport late, waved his hand and approached.\u201cYou\u2019re busy, how did you get here?\u201dHe heard that CEO Kim may not be able to come because there was an important production meeting today.\u201cEven though I said you were going, he should\u2019ve come.\u00a0But Lee Wooyeon, didn\u2019t this bastard come today?\u201dAt CEO Kim\u2019s words, Inseop\u2019s expression darkened.\u00a0He thought that today would be the last day, so he would come and see him off, but he couldn\u2019t find him in the end.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He is busy.\u201dManager Cha poked the side of CEO Kim and gave him a look.\u201cOh right.\u00a0Right. Some Japanese kids said they were busy doing something today.\u201dKnowing that these were all excuses for him, Inseop smiled hard and nodded his head.\u201cOkay.\u00a0Take care of yourself.\u00a0Please contact me when you come to Korea later.\u201d\u201cThank you for that.\u201dInseop bowed his head politely and greeted the two of them.\u00a0With tears in his eyes, CEO Kim wiped away the tears with his hands and quickly turned his head.\u00a0Manager Cha also turned red and the tip of his nose turned red and he silently tapped Inseop\u2019s shoulder.\u201cOh, by the way. Can I ask you a favor?\u201dChoi Inseop picked up a flowerpot at his feet and handed it to Manager Cha.\u201cI want you to pass this on to Lee Wooyeon.\u201d\u201cThis?\u00a0You want me to give him this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dIt was obviously Lee Wooyeon who brought Kate to the hospital room.\u00a0Inseop wanted to leave even this alone by Lee Wooyeon\u2019s side.\u00a0He was going to give it to Lee Wooyeon when he came today, but he had no choice but to hand it to Manager Cha.\u00a0Inseop gave Kate to Manager Cha and left a message to Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWater once every three days, and put it in a well-ventilated place\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Also, if he touches it too much, it will die, so please touch it in moderation\u2026\u00a0\u2026 but I don\u2019t think he will touch it.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u00a0Once every three days.\u00a0Ventilation.\u00a0Don\u2019t bother it.\u00a0Okay.\u201dManager Cha took the flowerpot and nodded.\u00a0Inseop bowed his head to the two and walked to the gate where his family stood.\u00a0Knowing that once he entered the security checkpoint, Inseop knew that he could no longer come out, as if sadly, he turned around and looked around again and again.Lee Wooyeon\u2019s appearance was also nowhere to be found.\u00a0He left regretfully and followed his parents into the counter.\u00a0The company gave Inseop and his parents plane tickets for first class, so they were able to get a seat earlier than the others.As Inseop sat by the window, his mother took out a blanket and put it on his lap.\u00a0The announcement for takeoff was heard and the plane slowly started moving over the runway.\u00a0When he heard the sound of the engine, he remembered the person holding his hand under the blanket, and Inseop\u2019s eyes reddened again.\u201cAre you sad to leave Korea?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t know.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if he was sad that he left Korea, or because he couldn\u2019t see Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Inseop could not understand why Lee Wooyeon had sent him to the United States without seeing him even once.Was he tired of him?\u00a0Did he say something to him that he shouldn\u2019t have?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Saying \u2018I love you\u2019 might have been a burden.He knew he was going to die, and he had the courage to say these words, but if he had known this would happen, he would have just said nothing.\u201cOh right.\u00a0Your friend asked me to give this to you.\u201d\u201cMy friend?\u201dHis mother took out a small notebook from her bag and handed it to Inseop.\u00a0Seeing the familiar notebook, Inseop\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\u201cWho was my friend?\u00a0Who gave you this?\u201d\u201cThey said Philip.\u00a0He said he was a friend you worked with.\u00a0He came and gave it to you while you were talking earlier.\u201dInseop stood up from his seat.\u201cWhere are you going!\u00a0The plane is now in the air.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmute00:00\u201cI have to go.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t even say goodbye to this person.\u201d\u201cEven if you go now, you can\u2019t see him anyway.\u00a0Peter.\u00a0It is a place where you can come whenever you want.\u201dAt his mother\u2019s words, Inseop sat down helplessly.\u00a0When did he come?\u00a0Where had he been\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Why didn\u2019t he even say goodbye..\u00a0\u2026\u00a0this cruel person.Watching the plane get farther away from Incheon International Airport, Inseop poured all kinds of curse at Lee Wooyeon.Rude guy.\u00a0He said he couldn\u2019t live without him, he said he would go to a mental hospital, the bad guy, the bad guy who didn\u2019t buy a fruit basket at the hospital, the bad guy.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0bad bastard.As soon as he confirmed that his mother was asleep, Inseop held back his tears and opened the notebook that Lee Wooyeon had handed her.\u00a0It was filled with small notes he had written about Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0The moment he saw it, the tears that he had been barely holding back, captured by all kinds of thoughts, came pouring down.\u00a0As he wiped his tears with the back of his hand, a strange thing caught his eye.A question mark was drawn in red under Lee Wooyeon\u2019s list of CDs he liked and notes about writers he was interested in.\u00a0Inseop began to carefully read the notes in the notebook again.Someone circled one of the authors in the notebook with a red pen and drew a question mark.\u00a0Choi Inseop could knew that the someone was Lee Wooyeon.He turned to the next page of the notebook.\u00a0There, Lee Wooyeon\u2019s favorite foods and restaurants were arranged.\u00a0There were traces of how hard they thought about which bread to choose for each day of the week.\u00a0Invariably, a red pen put an X at several restaurants.\u00a0On the bread, an X and a circle were drawn alternately.What the hell was this?Inseop moved on to the next page.\u00a0It was the same.\u00a0The information and materials he had collected for Lee Wooyeon were filled with corrections with a red pen.It wasn\u2019t a long sentence or word, it was a sign of good, bad, or degree, but all were checked without missing, one by one.\u00a0Inseop wondered if this was Lee Wooyeon\u2019s joke, but knowing that he was not the kind of person to waste time like this, he flipped over the notebook one by one.At that moment, the paper that had been inserted in the middle of it popped and fell.\u00a0Inseop opened the paper that had fallen on his lap and read it.\u00a0It was a contract.\u00a0In the last contract written, Lee Wooyeon underlined the contract period with a red pen.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Did this mean that he wanted compensation for breach of contract?As Inseop was trying to put the contract in, he found something nested under it and sighed.It was a photo.\u00a0It was a picture of Lee Wooyeon in an alleyway that he kept in a secret pocket inside the notebook.Lee Wooyeon, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Did he know that he had this picture?\u00a0Since when.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Why didn\u2019t he say anything?\u00a0Since when\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Why did he give this back to him?\u00a0What if he does weird things with this?\u00a0Did this mean he believed in him?\u00a0What was he thinking\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He did not know.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t quite figure out what this person was thinking.Inseop stopped trying to understand Lee Wooyeon.\u201cWhy are you giving back this picture?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, after\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop checked once more that there were no eyes around, and carefully picked up the picture with his fingertips.\u00a0In the photo, Lee Wooyeon was standing with an expressionless face.\u00a0At first, he thought Lee Wooyeon in this picture was very scary, but now that he saw it, it felt familiar.Being human is\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0They are very adaptable animals.Inseop looked at the photos while admiring his own adaptability.\u00a0It was at the same time that he saw the sign written in the corner.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dDid he sign his own autograph and send it to him?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Really, it was just like Lee Wooyeon.Inseop sighed and folded the picture to fit it in the notebook.\u00a0It was then that he saw that Lee Wooyeon left a brief note behind the photo.\u00a0He turned the picture back and unfolded it.\u00a0The elegant handwriting left with a red pen was engraved in Inseop\u2019s vision.\u300cEnjoy your vacation.\u300dWith that single word, Inseop could understand the meaning of Lee Wooyeon\u2019s handing over the notebook to him.\u2018I\u2019ll give you a vacation, so take a break and come back.You have another 30 years left on your contract.Please take good care of my demanding tastes in the future.\u2019\u201cHaha\u2026ha\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLaughter erupted.\u00a0Every time he laughed, the wound on his back hurt, but he couldn\u2019t stop laughing.\u00a0Hot tears quickly flowed down his face.Knowing that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s message to him was pointing to a new beginning rather than the end, Inseop could comfortably lean on the seat.It was the beginning of a long journey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

organic.><Yes.\u00a0Anyway, I was just about to leave.><Are you going to the library?><I\u2019ll return books and do some stuff.><Go ahead.>Inseop\u2019s footsteps as he left the front door were light.\u00a0It has been about a month since he came to America, and his wounds have improved a lot and his complexion has brightened.\u00a0It was only natural for his blood color to return when he ate the healthy dishes that his mother made.Inseop was also exercising regularly.\u00a0He still had to go for a walk alone because he didn\u2019t have to work too hard, but he did exercise every day without skipping a day.\u00a0Will, who was in the yard, thought he was going for a walk and followed him and waved his tail.\u201cNo.\u00a0wait.\u00a0Today I will go alone.\u201dHe ruffled Will\u2019s fur with his hands and left the house.\u00a0Returning the borrowed book from the library, he bought flowers from the florist.\u00a0It was a flower to bring to Jennie.\u00a0He boarded the bus with the bunch of freesias she loved.Arriving at the cemetery, Inseop visited Jennie\u2019s grave and laid down the bouquet.<Happy Birthday,\u00a0Jennie.\u00a0You are still nineteen.>If they had still been together, they would have been able to share more fun and interesting stories.\u00a0If he could tell her what happened in Korea, how would she react?She wouldn\u2019t believe it and laugh.\u00a0Will her eyes brighten and beg him to tell her the next thing?<I know Philip is a bad guy, but\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t think he read your letter.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t the kind of person to read the letter in the first place.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It must have been other people who did bad things to you.>It was a conclusion that Inseop came up with about the letter as he had been watching Lee Wooyeon, who had never touched a letter at all.<Sorry.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Jennie.\u00a0\u2019cause I didn\u2019t believe you\u00a0At that time, no matter what anyone said, I should have been on your side.>He wiped away the tears, muttering the remorse remaining in his heart.\u00a0After sitting on Jennie\u2019s grave for a while and talking about various things, he remembered that his mother had told him to buy rice flour and got up.<I\u2019ll come again next time.>Inseop said goodbye to Jennie and left the cemetery.\u00a0He got out of town and went to the\u00a0post office.He sent a letter to Lee Wooyeon yesterday and asked the post office worker how long it would take to arrive.\u00a0The employee returned the same answer as before, saying, \u201cSince it\u2019s a limited express, I think I\u2019ll be there in two days.\u201d\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Then it would have arrived.Five days ago, Inseop mustered up the courage to write a letter to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Since arriving in the United States, they had not made any calls, texts, or mails.\u00a0Neither Lee Wooyeon, nor Choi Inseop.They did not contact each other as if they had promised.\u00a0Inseop was hesitant as to how many times he would pick up the phone and call him, but he barely endured it because he thought he would run to Korea right away after hearing his voice.It was an act close to a whim when he found a bunch of orange stationery he had bought before while cleaning out his bookshelf and decided to write a letter.After crumpling dozens of papers and throwing them in the trash, he managed to complete the letter.<Hello.\u00a0This is Choi Inseop.\u00a0I am doing well.\u00a0I wonder how you are doing.\u00a0I\u2019ll be back when summer vacation is over.ps-Is Kate doing well?>The last word added was added as a joke\u00a0Of course, he didn\u2019t know if the other side would take that as a joke.After sending the letter, Inseop looked into the mailbox several times a day.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t help but wait, even though he knew it wasn\u2019t the right time for a reply.\u00a0Even if there was no reply, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0If he calls him\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.Inseop shook his head.\u00a0No, no.In this situation, if Lee Wooyeon makes a phone call, he may fly to Korea and forget that he was on vacation because he was sick.\u00a0It was a decision he made deliberately with him in mind, and had to be patient and follow it.\u00a0Yes, he had to be patient.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He felt like he forgot something.\u00a0Ah!\u00a0Rice flour.Inseop turned to the place where the Korean mart was.\u00a0His mother, whose hobby was baking, baked bread with rice flour.\u00a0Saying hello to the familiar old lady, he went into the store and picked up rice flour.\u201cHave you been on a trip?\u201dHaving been away from the United States for a year, people around him thought he was on a trip.\u00a0Inseop smiled and replied yes.\u201cWas it fun?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was fun, but \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t think I will ever forget it.\u201d\u201cThen, the hardships are because you are young.\u201dInseop\u2019s smile was drawn at the warm voice of the hostess, whom he had not heard in a long time.\u00a0After checkout, she turned around and turned up the volume of the TV as she said, oh, oh, oh.\u00a0Judging from the fact that she was speaking Korean, it seemed that it was her favorite Korean entertainment program.\u00a0It was an ironic fate that the name Lee Wooyeon came into Inseop\u2019s ears as he was about to leave the store.He turned and walked quickly to the counter where the television was installed.\u201cWhat did you say now?\u201d\u201cSome celebrity had a big accident.\u00a0The person who was filming that drama had an accident last time too.\u00a0What curse did that drama have?\u201d\u201cWho is the person who was in the accident?\u201d\u201cWhat was his name, Lee\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIs this Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cYes, but why?\u201d\u201cWas he badly injured?\u00a0What are they saying?\u00a0How hurt is he?\u201dWhen Inseop asked in a voice that was on the verge of tears, the store owner widened her eyes and shrugged.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u00a0I just saw it on the show and they said that the car was half destroyed.\u00a0They\u2019ll never be able to shoot a drama aga\u2026in!!\u00a0Peter!\u201dInseop ran out of the store.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t run yet, but he was not in a position to walk.\u00a0He had to go home and pack his things right now.His parents won\u2019t allow him, but he\u2019ll explain later, because first of all, he had to pack up and go.\u00a0No, he doesn\u2019t even need luggage.\u00a0All he needed was his passport and money.He had to meet that person somehow.\u00a0Somehow.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ha\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t even run a single block, so he was out of breath.\u00a0His heartbeat increased and he bowed his back and panted for a while.\u00a0His legs were already heavy.\u00a0He had to go though.\u00a0Inseop took a deep breath, exhaled, straightened his back and started walking.When he crossed the corner and arrived in front of his house, he saw a black Benz parked.\u00a0He was wondering whose car it was, but now he didn\u2019t have time to worry about it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop stopped walking, as if frozen in place.A man was standing in front of his house.\u00a0With a cast on his right shoulder, he stood in front of the front door with a stiff expression and was looking at his house.\u201c\u2026Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cInseop.\u201dEven looking at it, he could not believe it, Inseop blinked his eyes several times.\u00a0It was Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was now in America, standing in front of his house.\u201cUh, how do you\u2026no,\u00a0 there was an injury, there was an accident, where and how much\u2026\u00a0\u2026to the hospital\u2026\u00a0\u2026Are you okay?\u201dNot knowing what to ask first, he stuttered out all the words that came to his mind.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon made a troubled face for a moment, then opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Inseop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Kate is not doing well.\u201dA flowerpot lay at his feet. It was fresh for not doing well. How the hell did he get on the plane with that? No, does that mean Kate came here sick? What the hell is it?Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon with a face that he did not understand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon sighed, then narrowed his eyes.\u201cI got a letter.\u201dHe pulled out the orange envelope from Inseop from his pocket.\u201cOriginally, I was going to have you stay in America for six months.\u201dInseop was also thinking that it would be okay to return to Korea around that time.\u00a0Of course, he missed Lee Wooyeon so much, but he felt sorry for his family, and it was because he decided that it was urgent to recover his health here.\u201cI didn\u2019t contact you on purpose.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t go to see your face even thou I wanted to see you, because I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to let you go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe guessed it.\u00a0Through the notebook Lee Wooyeon sent, Inseop also noticed that he had given him a long vacation, and that he did not come to see him because he feared that he would not be able to send him back.\u201cBut then, that one letter\u2026\u00a0 drove me crazy.\u201dLee Wooyeon received Inseop\u2019s letter and read the same content hundreds or even thousands of times.\u00a0When he finally reached the point of masturbating while reading the letter, Lee Wooyeon changed his mind, thinking that he couldn\u2019t do it.Let\u2019s go see Choi Inseop.\u201cThe accident\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Why\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed.He couldn\u2019t help it.\u00a0There were no drama plans, but the atmosphere was atrocious because of the accident that happened before, and he didn\u2019t think he could make the time without giving a plausible excuse. Lee Wooyeon just quietly drove out of his car.\u00a0The Mercedes-Benz that CEO Kim gave him was half destroyed. The doctor said that if something went wrong, his nerve could be cut and the arm could not be used forever.\u00a0And as a result, the drama was postponed indefinitely.\u00a0After Kang Youngmo and Lee Wooyeon had an accident, drama investors said they were unlucky from the start and decided to withdraw.\u00a0CEO Kim fell clutching the back of his neck, but Lee Wooyeon was able to confidently say that he would go and rest.Inseop took one step closer to him.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dSeeing the tears in his eyes filled with worries for him, Lee Wooyeon thought that he was lucky to have caused the accident.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0are the bones broken?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u00a0I will get well soon.\u201d\u201cDid you do this on purpose?\u201dLearn morePauseUnmute00:00Inseop\u2019s voice was filled with resentment.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon smiled vaguely and did not answer, Inseop raised his voice.\u201cWhy are you like that?\u00a0Why!\u00a0I can see you after a while anyway\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0If you get hurt like this\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon embraced Inseop with one arm.\u201cFuckt, I\u2019m going crazy because I miss you, what do you want me to do?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to die, but I only read and read your letter all day, I keep thinking about you, I want to touch you\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I came here because I thought I was going crazy.\u00a0Can\u2019t I do that?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked again.\u201cIs that not possible?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDid Inseop not want to see me?\u201dInseop nodded slightly in his arms.\u00a0He said \u201cI miss you,\u201d swallowing the lump in his throat.\u00a0After taking a deep breath, Lee Wooyeon opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I want to kiss Inseop, but I\u2019m having a bit of trouble here.\u00a0First, let\u2019s go to the hotel.\u201dInseop wiped away his tears.\u201cHold on a second, please.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dEven on the plane from Korea to the United States, Lee Wooyeon could not sleep at the thought of seeing Inseop.\u00a0He rented a car from the airport and came here, almost ignoring the signal.\u00a0The word \u201cHold on a second\u201d that came out of Inseop\u2019s mouth now sounded crueler to him than to wait for the rest of his life.Inseop went to the front door and put down the package he was holding.\u00a0Then he came back to Lee Wooyeon and said,\u201cLet\u2019s go now\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

82Translated by NaralaraEdited by NaralaraWhen the hotel door closed, Lee Wooyeon ran like a hungry person and kissed Inseop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t speak until Inseop, who was out of breath, gasped and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon put Inseop next to him and said.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I thought I was going to be like this, so I didn\u2019t want to see you for a while.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t have the confidence not to force Inseop to be next to him.\u00a0When he saw him, he wanted to touch him, and when he touched him, he got greedy, he wanted him, and he wanted to hold him in his arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dHe said as he straightened Inseop\u2019s disheveled collar.\u00a0Inseop asked why?\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0When your heart is strained, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I heard you needed to take it easy.\u201dAfter listening to the doctor\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon decided to send Inseop to the United States.\u00a0For the time being, he wanted to free Inseop from noisy problems, but above all, he was not confident that he would not touch him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you to the United States, but it\u2019s really not worth it.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and stroked Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0Inseop slowly closed his eyes once and opened them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I recently went to the doctor.\u00a0He\u2019s a doctor I\u2019ve been seeing since I was little\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHearing Inseop\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon kissed the top of his head.\u00a0Right now, he wanted to hug his body and go inside him, but he managed to hold on with reason.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Aren\u2019t you curious what I asked?\u201dInseop\u2019s face was flushed red.\u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d\u201cCa, can I do it\u2026\u00a0The doctor said if I don\u2019t overdo it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s clothes and kissed him roughly.\u00a0Inseop also tried his best to match his gestures and took off his clothes.\u00a0With his left hand, he didn\u2019t move as well as he thought, and Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue as if impatiently.\u201cI will\u2026\u00a0I will take it off.\u201dThinking that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s injured hand might be hurting, Inseop mustered up the courage and said.\u201cInseop, are you going to take it off?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCrossing the sea, good things happen.\u201dInseop was so shy that he didn\u2019t take off his clothes first.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon unbuttoned his shirt with one hand and looked at Inseop.\u00a0He was asking him to take it off.Inseop loosened the belt of his pants and unzipped his pants.\u00a0In the quiet room, there was an unusually loud sound of the zipper being lowered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon swallowed hard.\u00a0Inseop lowered his pants and took off his shoes.\u00a0When he took off his socks and put them next to his pants, he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s piercing gaze and his shoulders shook involuntarily.\u201cTake your top off as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOr will you take off your panties first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, could you please turn your head for a moment?\u201dIn a while, they were going to be all naked, biting and sucking, but Lee Wooyeon turned his head back as Inseop asked.\u201cIs it done?\u201d\u201cNot yet, wait a minute.\u201dHe heard the sound of Inseop taking off his clothes.\u00a0The sound of the hem of his clothes rubbing against his skin and falling off his feet made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath warm.\u201cAre you all naked?\u201d\u201cYe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon turned his head, Inseop, who was not wearing a single thing, stood there with his head bowed as if embarrassed.Lee Wooyeon, who looked at him as if possessed, held out his hand.\u201cCome here.\u201dInseop crouched and walked towards him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon held him in his arms and stood still for a while.\u00a0When he didn\u2019t do anything to him, Inseop got a little scared.\u00a0There were surgical scars around the chest, but he was worried that he might not like the body that had scars on the back as well.\u201cInseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice softly called out his name.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou said it was okay to have similar feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cLike a normal person, I like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI like you, Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I see Inseop, I want to hug you, I want to touch you, I want to have you by my side somehow, and if I don\u2019t see you, I think I\u2019ll go crazy.\u00a0So far, it\u2019s just normal feelings, but I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s not the end.\u201dInseop could barely guess what Lee Wooyeon\u2019s twisted feelings were.\u00a0It was the result of experiencing and realizing his dark abyss through a series of events.\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry for saying this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine.\u201dInseop said, giving strength to the arm that embraced Lee Wooyeon.\u201cEven if it\u2019s like that, I\u2019m fine so \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I wish you could tell me that you like me.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cMore.\u00a0Once more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dInseop burst into tears and buried his face in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s chest.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon kissed him.\u00a0Both bodies fell on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s legs and let out a hot breath.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock is so pretty.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2014-.\u201d\u201cFuck, don\u2019t show this cute cock to anyone but me.\u201dInseop\u2019s breathing became increasingly difficult because of the movement of the hand rubbing between his legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked several times if he was okay and kissed the nape of his neck.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it slow.\u201dIt was hard to resist because the bottom was hot, but Lee Wooyeon moved his body as slowly as possible so that Inseop did not overdo it.\u00a0Inseop, who was under Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body, started breathing more and more, and finally, with tears in his eyes, he grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u00a0Should I go slower?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u201cThen tell me what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Too\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s too slow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my head, \u2026 is muddled.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too slow\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my\u00a0body\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon said fuck and cursed and made Inseop sit up.\u00a0By making Inseop\u2019s legs spread apart, he pushed in his wet cock.\u00a0Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder and took a deep breath.\u00a0His genitals were half entered through the narrow hole.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon exhaled and held it in.\u201cThere\u2019s more to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWe still have half left.\u00a0Breathe in, so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed in the remaining at once.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body dropped and he let out a loud moan.\u201cGood job.\u00a0I\u2019m all in now, so I\u2019ll move in a little bit.\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0His stomach was tingling and his bottom was burning, so he just wanted him to do something, anything.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Now, if I move, Inseop will get hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026Me\u2026it\u2019s hot down there\u2026\u201dEven though he didn;t even touch him, Inseop\u2019s genitals slowly hardened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clenched his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll move then,\u201d and raised his waist slowly.\u00a0A quiet moan escaped Inseop\u2019s lips.Lee Wooyeon slid back and moved his waist forward.\u00a0The gaping hole made a squeaky gurgling sound and sucked in his flesh.\u00a0Cold sweat formed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead as he tried to suppress the seething desire.Choi Inseop, too, was suffering, panting for breath, as if he was about to fall, and the sensations below that seemed to sting.\u201cWooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please, \u2026Underneath, it\u2019s hot\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his teeth desperately.\u00a0His lips ripped open and blood flowed, and he tried his best to resist the urge.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Then, Inseop will move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work, so you can move as you please.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed Inseop\u2019s body up, and he lay down on the bed.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face turned even redder than before when he sat down on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thigh.\u201cI won\u2019t move, so you move.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmuteLee Wooyeon took his hand away from Inseop\u2019s body and said.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at him with tears in his eyes.\u201cMove your back.\u00a0Loosen up the hole a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0ugh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you tighten it too much, it hurts, yes, up and down, ha\u2026ha\u2026\u00a0you just need to move your hips on it.\u00a0With my dick in your ass, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ha.\u00a0Good job.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon instructed, Inseop moved his waist.\u00a0Every time his buttocks touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thighs, his genitals touched his stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled Inseop\u2019s hand and made him touch his genitals.\u201cInseop, try touching it yourself.\u201dWhen he moved his hands entwined with his still-hot genitals, the front and back were stimulated, and Inseop went crazy.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0ah\u2026\u00a0\u201dWatching him shake his back and move his hands in a trance, Lee Wo-yeon bit his teeth.\u00a0Being unable to move even in front of a superb view was like a kind of torture to him.\u201cAhhh!\u00a0Wooyeon ah, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ah!\u201dThe contraction of the hole was faster than before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t take it any longer, so he got up, hugging Inseop.\u00a0He let out a groan, and pounded his waist between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Inseop, who reached his climax with a single shovel, stretched out on the bed, screaming, out of breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pounded his waist a few more times and ejaculated inside Inseop\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWith his eyes wide open, Lee Wooyeon, who exhaled at the peak of pleasure, gradually regained his reason.\u00a0When he found Inseop breathing hard under his body, he shouted in shock.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Shall we go to the hospital?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I \u2026I couldn\u2019t stand it until the end.\u201dIn the end, he thought it was like this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop, who was drenched in sweat and was out of breath, and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dInseop had less strength and embraced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body with his slightly trembling hands.\u00a0He wanted to do this.\u00a0At that time, he wanted to tell Lee Wooyeon, who came to him that night, while hugging him like this.\u201cI am fine.\u00a0I\u2019m stronger than you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to be so sorry about.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u00a0It\u2019s all my choice\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t hard, but that\u2019s okay.\u201dInseop poured out all the words he wanted to say that day.\u201cMy heart is strong.\u00a0Not that weak.\u00a0It\u2019s survived several surgeries, it\u2019s Jennie\u2019s last gift, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Above all, I endured Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0So I think it\u2019s fine.\u00a0So, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a heart that has been trained as a madman.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tone was filled with laughter.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and laughed along.\u00a0The two held each other other for a while.\u2018Sleep when you\u2019re sleepy.\u2019Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s hair and whispered.A heartbeat could be heard from the overlaid body.\u00a0When the two sounds sounded like one, Inseop could fall asleep in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms.In the dim light, a man opened an orange letterhead and read the letter.\u00a0Just like he always dreamed of.When Inseop opened his eyes, he reached out and stroked his arm, wondering if the man next to him was real and not a dreamer.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dA friendly voice was heard.\u00a0Inseop was relieved by the voice, closed his eyes and smiled.\u201cSleep more.\u00a0It\u2019s still night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0call home\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI did it before.\u00a0I told them it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you, so you\u2019ll be late.\u201dLee Wooyeon wrapped Inseop\u2019s hair on his fingertips, fiddling around with him, and telling him kind words.\u201cI read the letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe letter that Inseop gave me\u2026\u00a0To think that I have been there before and haven\u2019t read it makes me angry at the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0After all, I didn\u2019t write the content.\u201d\u201cStill, Inseop wrote it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to read it,\u201d he said in Inseop\u2019s ear, a voice that subsided with a sigh.\u00a0Closing his eyes and letting his mind wander, Inseop asked about Kate, as if in a sleep talk.\u201cWhere is she hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0She\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0I water once every three days.\u00a0In a well-ventilated place, and I don\u2019t bother.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, who memorized the words he had been asked to deliver, Inseop gave a small laugh.\u201cAfter seeing Inseop\u2019s letter, I wanted to make an excuse somehow.\u00a0So, I put Kate in my bag and bought a plane ticket to America.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dPlants were strictly prohibited items.\u00a0In some cases, if one was caught hiding something like that, they will be banned from entering the country.\u00a0Inseop was unable to speak properly at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s recklessness.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You didn\u2019t know I was this crazy, do you regret that we got involved for nothing?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0But even if you regret\u00a0\u2026 it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs if Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice sounded gloomy as he said that, Inseop reached out and placed his hand on his finger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop.\u00a0Inseop moved his fingers and put his finger between Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingers.And he gave strength to his fingers.\u201cMore\u2026\u00a0You can tie me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to keep living, tied up to you.\u201dIf Lee Wooyeon likes it.At the end, Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand as if he was talking to himself.\u00a0Knowing what the hand holding him tightly meant, Inseop put his head on his hand and closed his eyes.Rare, rare, sleep rushed in, and he feltLee Wooyeon\u2019s friendly touch.\u00a0A friendly voice coexisting in dream and reality put Inseop into a deep sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

82Translated by NaralaraEdited by NaralaraWhen the hotel door closed, Lee Wooyeon ran like a hungry person and kissed Inseop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t speak until Inseop, who was out of breath, gasped and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon put Inseop next to him and said.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I thought I was going to be like this, so I didn\u2019t want to see you for a while.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t have the confidence not to force Inseop to be next to him.\u00a0When he saw him, he wanted to touch him, and when he touched him, he got greedy, he wanted him, and he wanted to hold him in his arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dHe said as he straightened Inseop\u2019s disheveled collar.\u00a0Inseop asked why?\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0When your heart is strained, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I heard you needed to take it easy.\u201dAfter listening to the doctor\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon decided to send Inseop to the United States.\u00a0For the time being, he wanted to free Inseop from noisy problems, but above all, he was not confident that he would not touch him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you to the United States, but it\u2019s really not worth it.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and stroked Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0Inseop slowly closed his eyes once and opened them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I recently went to the doctor.\u00a0He\u2019s a doctor I\u2019ve been seeing since I was little\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHearing Inseop\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon kissed the top of his head.\u00a0Right now, he wanted to hug his body and go inside him, but he managed to hold on with reason.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Aren\u2019t you curious what I asked?\u201dInseop\u2019s face was flushed red.\u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d\u201cCa, can I do it\u2026\u00a0The doctor said if I don\u2019t overdo it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s clothes and kissed him roughly.\u00a0Inseop also tried his best to match his gestures and took off his clothes.\u00a0With his left hand, he didn\u2019t move as well as he thought, and Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue as if impatiently.\u201cI will\u2026\u00a0I will take it off.\u201dThinking that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s injured hand might be hurting, Inseop mustered up the courage and said.\u201cInseop, are you going to take it off?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCrossing the sea, good things happen.\u201dInseop was so shy that he didn\u2019t take off his clothes first.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon unbuttoned his shirt with one hand and looked at Inseop.\u00a0He was asking him to take it off.Inseop loosened the belt of his pants and unzipped his pants.\u00a0In the quiet room, there was an unusually loud sound of the zipper being lowered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon swallowed hard.\u00a0Inseop lowered his pants and took off his shoes.\u00a0When he took off his socks and put them next to his pants, he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s piercing gaze and his shoulders shook involuntarily.\u201cTake your top off as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOr will you take off your panties first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, could you please turn your head for a moment?\u201dIn a while, they were going to be all naked, biting and sucking, but Lee Wooyeon turned his head back as Inseop asked.\u201cIs it done?\u201d\u201cNot yet, wait a minute.\u201dHe heard the sound of Inseop taking off his clothes.\u00a0The sound of the hem of his clothes rubbing against his skin and falling off his feet made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath warm.\u201cAre you all naked?\u201d\u201cYe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon turned his head, Inseop, who was not wearing a single thing, stood there with his head bowed as if embarrassed.Lee Wooyeon, who looked at him as if possessed, held out his hand.\u201cCome here.\u201dInseop crouched and walked towards him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon held him in his arms and stood still for a while.\u00a0When he didn\u2019t do anything to him, Inseop got a little scared.\u00a0There were surgical scars around the chest, but he was worried that he might not like the body that had scars on the back as well.\u201cInseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice softly called out his name.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou said it was okay to have similar feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cLike a normal person, I like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI like you, Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I see Inseop, I want to hug you, I want to touch you, I want to have you by my side somehow, and if I don\u2019t see you, I think I\u2019ll go crazy.\u00a0So far, it\u2019s just normal feelings, but I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s not the end.\u201dInseop could barely guess what Lee Wooyeon\u2019s twisted feelings were.\u00a0It was the result of experiencing and realizing his dark abyss through a series of events.\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry for saying this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine.\u201dInseop said, giving strength to the arm that embraced Lee Wooyeon.\u201cEven if it\u2019s like that, I\u2019m fine so \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I wish you could tell me that you like me.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cMore.\u00a0Once more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dInseop burst into tears and buried his face in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s chest.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon kissed him.\u00a0Both bodies fell on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s legs and let out a hot breath.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock is so pretty.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2014-.\u201d\u201cFuck, don\u2019t show this cute cock to anyone but me.\u201dInseop\u2019s breathing became increasingly difficult because of the movement of the hand rubbing between his legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked several times if he was okay and kissed the nape of his neck.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it slow.\u201dIt was hard to resist because the bottom was hot, but Lee Wooyeon moved his body as slowly as possible so that Inseop did not overdo it.\u00a0Inseop, who was under Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body, started breathing more and more, and finally, with tears in his eyes, he grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u00a0Should I go slower?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u201cThen tell me what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Too\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s too slow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my head, \u2026 is muddled.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too slow\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my\u00a0body\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon said fuck and cursed and made Inseop sit up.\u00a0By making Inseop\u2019s legs spread apart, he pushed in his wet cock.\u00a0Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder and took a deep breath.\u00a0His genitals were half entered through the narrow hole.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon exhaled and held it in.\u201cThere\u2019s more to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWe still have half left.\u00a0Breathe in, so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed in the remaining at once.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body dropped and he let out a loud moan.\u201cGood job.\u00a0I\u2019m all in now, so I\u2019ll move in a little bit.\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0His stomach was tingling and his bottom was burning, so he just wanted him to do something, anything.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Now, if I move, Inseop will get hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026Me\u2026it\u2019s hot down there\u2026\u201dEven though he didn;t even touch him, Inseop\u2019s genitals slowly hardened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clenched his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll move then,\u201d and raised his waist slowly.\u00a0A quiet moan escaped Inseop\u2019s lips.Lee Wooyeon slid back and moved his waist forward.\u00a0The gaping hole made a squeaky gurgling sound and sucked in his flesh.\u00a0Cold sweat formed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead as he tried to suppress the seething desire.Choi Inseop, too, was suffering, panting for breath, as if he was about to fall, and the sensations below that seemed to sting.\u201cWooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please, \u2026Underneath, it\u2019s hot\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his teeth desperately.\u00a0His lips ripped open and blood flowed, and he tried his best to resist the urge.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Then, Inseop will move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work, so you can move as you please.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed Inseop\u2019s body up, and he lay down on the bed.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face turned even redder than before when he sat down on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thigh.\u201cI won\u2019t move, so you move.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmuteLee Wooyeon took his hand away from Inseop\u2019s body and said.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at him with tears in his eyes.\u201cMove your back.\u00a0Loosen up the hole a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0ugh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you tighten it too much, it hurts, yes, up and down, ha\u2026ha\u2026\u00a0you just need to move your hips on it.\u00a0With my dick in your ass, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ha.\u00a0Good job.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon instructed, Inseop moved his waist.\u00a0Every time his buttocks touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thighs, his genitals touched his stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled Inseop\u2019s hand and made him touch his genitals.\u201cInseop, try touching it yourself.\u201dWhen he moved his hands entwined with his still-hot genitals, the front and back were stimulated, and Inseop went crazy.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0ah\u2026\u00a0\u201dWatching him shake his back and move his hands in a trance, Lee Wo-yeon bit his teeth.\u00a0Being unable to move even in front of a superb view was like a kind of torture to him.\u201cAhhh!\u00a0Wooyeon ah, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ah!\u201dThe contraction of the hole was faster than before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t take it any longer, so he got up, hugging Inseop.\u00a0He let out a groan, and pounded his waist between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Inseop, who reached his climax with a single shovel, stretched out on the bed, screaming, out of breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pounded his waist a few more times and ejaculated inside Inseop\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWith his eyes wide open, Lee Wooyeon, who exhaled at the peak of pleasure, gradually regained his reason.\u00a0When he found Inseop breathing hard under his body, he shouted in shock.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Shall we go to the hospital?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I \u2026I couldn\u2019t stand it until the end.\u201dIn the end, he thought it was like this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop, who was drenched in sweat and was out of breath, and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dInseop had less strength and embraced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body with his slightly trembling hands.\u00a0He wanted to do this.\u00a0At that time, he wanted to tell Lee Wooyeon, who came to him that night, while hugging him like this.\u201cI am fine.\u00a0I\u2019m stronger than you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to be so sorry about.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u00a0It\u2019s all my choice\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t hard, but that\u2019s okay.\u201dInseop poured out all the words he wanted to say that day.\u201cMy heart is strong.\u00a0Not that weak.\u00a0It\u2019s survived several surgeries, it\u2019s Jennie\u2019s last gift, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Above all, I endured Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0So I think it\u2019s fine.\u00a0So, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a heart that has been trained as a madman.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tone was filled with laughter.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and laughed along.\u00a0The two held each other other for a while.\u2018Sleep when you\u2019re sleepy.\u2019Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s hair and whispered.A heartbeat could be heard from the overlaid body.\u00a0When the two sounds sounded like one, Inseop could fall asleep in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms.In the dim light, a man opened an orange letterhead and read the letter.\u00a0Just like he always dreamed of.When Inseop opened his eyes, he reached out and stroked his arm, wondering if the man next to him was real and not a dreamer.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dA friendly voice was heard.\u00a0Inseop was relieved by the voice, closed his eyes and smiled.\u201cSleep more.\u00a0It\u2019s still night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0call home\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI did it before.\u00a0I told them it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you, so you\u2019ll be late.\u201dLee Wooyeon wrapped Inseop\u2019s hair on his fingertips, fiddling around with him, and telling him kind words.\u201cI read the letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe letter that Inseop gave me\u2026\u00a0To think that I have been there before and haven\u2019t read it makes me angry at the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0After all, I didn\u2019t write the content.\u201d\u201cStill, Inseop wrote it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to read it,\u201d he said in Inseop\u2019s ear, a voice that subsided with a sigh.\u00a0Closing his eyes and letting his mind wander, Inseop asked about Kate, as if in a sleep talk.\u201cWhere is she hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0She\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0I water once every three days.\u00a0In a well-ventilated place, and I don\u2019t bother.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, who memorized the words he had been asked to deliver, Inseop gave a small laugh.\u201cAfter seeing Inseop\u2019s letter, I wanted to make an excuse somehow.\u00a0So, I put Kate in my bag and bought a plane ticket to America.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dPlants were strictly prohibited items.\u00a0In some cases, if one was caught hiding something like that, they will be banned from entering the country.\u00a0Inseop was unable to speak properly at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s recklessness.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You didn\u2019t know I was this crazy, do you regret that we got involved for nothing?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0But even if you regret\u00a0\u2026 it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs if Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice sounded gloomy as he said that, Inseop reached out and placed his hand on his finger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop.\u00a0Inseop moved his fingers and put his finger between Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingers.And he gave strength to his fingers.\u201cMore\u2026\u00a0You can tie me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to keep living, tied up to you.\u201dIf Lee Wooyeon likes it.At the end, Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand as if he was talking to himself.\u00a0Knowing what the hand holding him tightly meant, Inseop put his head on his hand and closed his eyes.Rare, rare, sleep rushed in, and he feltLee Wooyeon\u2019s friendly touch.\u00a0A friendly voice coexisting in dream and reality put Inseop into a deep sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

gasped and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon put Inseop next to him and said.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I thought I was going to be like this, so I didn\u2019t want to see you for a while.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t have the confidence not to force Inseop to be next to him.\u00a0When he saw him, he wanted to touch him, and when he touched him, he got greedy, he wanted him, and he wanted to hold him in his arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dHe said as he straightened Inseop\u2019s disheveled collar.\u00a0Inseop asked why?\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0When your heart is strained, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I heard you needed to take it easy.\u201dAfter listening to the doctor\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon decided to send Inseop to the United States.\u00a0For the time being, he wanted to free Inseop from noisy problems, but above all, he was not confident that he would not touch him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you to the United States, but it\u2019s really not worth it.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and stroked Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0Inseop slowly closed his eyes once and opened them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I recently went to the doctor.\u00a0He\u2019s a doctor I\u2019ve been seeing since I was little\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHearing Inseop\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon kissed the top of his head.\u00a0Right now, he wanted to hug his body and go inside him, but he managed to hold on with reason.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Aren\u2019t you curious what I asked?\u201dInseop\u2019s face was flushed red.\u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d\u201cCa, can I do it\u2026\u00a0The doctor said if I don\u2019t overdo it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s clothes and kissed him roughly.\u00a0Inseop also tried his best to match his gestures and took off his clothes.\u00a0With his left hand, he didn\u2019t move as well as he thought, and Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue as if impatiently.\u201cI will\u2026\u00a0I will take it off.\u201dThinking that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s injured hand might be hurting, Inseop mustered up the courage and said.\u201cInseop, are you going to take it off?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCrossing the sea, good things happen.\u201dInseop was so shy that he didn\u2019t take off his clothes first.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon unbuttoned his shirt with one hand and looked at Inseop.\u00a0He was asking him to take it off.Inseop loosened the belt of his pants and unzipped his pants.\u00a0In the quiet room, there was an unusually loud sound of the zipper being lowered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon swallowed hard.\u00a0Inseop lowered his pants and took off his shoes.\u00a0When he took off his socks and put them next to his pants, he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s piercing gaze and his shoulders shook involuntarily.\u201cTake your top off as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOr will you take off your panties first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, could you please turn your head for a moment?\u201dIn a while, they were going to be all naked, biting and sucking, but Lee Wooyeon turned his head back as Inseop asked.\u201cIs it done?\u201d\u201cNot yet, wait a minute.\u201dHe heard the sound of Inseop taking off his clothes.\u00a0The sound of the hem of his clothes rubbing against his skin and falling off his feet made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath warm.\u201cAre you all naked?\u201d\u201cYe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon turned his head, Inseop, who was not wearing a single thing, stood there with his head bowed as if embarrassed.Lee Wooyeon, who looked at him as if possessed, held out his hand.\u201cCome here.\u201dInseop crouched and walked towards him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon held him in his arms and stood still for a while.\u00a0When he didn\u2019t do anything to him, Inseop got a little scared.\u00a0There were surgical scars around the chest, but he was worried that he might not like the body that had scars on the back as well.\u201cInseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice softly called out his name.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou said it was okay to have similar feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cLike a normal person, I like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI like you, Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I see Inseop, I want to hug you, I want to touch you, I want to have you by my side somehow, and if I don\u2019t see you, I think I\u2019ll go crazy.\u00a0So far, it\u2019s just normal feelings, but I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s not the end.\u201dInseop could barely guess what Lee Wooyeon\u2019s twisted feelings were.\u00a0It was the result of experiencing and realizing his dark abyss through a series of events.\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry for saying this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine.\u201dInseop said, giving strength to the arm that embraced Lee Wooyeon.\u201cEven if it\u2019s like that, I\u2019m fine so \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I wish you could tell me that you like me.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cMore.\u00a0Once more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dInseop burst into tears and buried his face in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s chest.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon kissed him.\u00a0Both bodies fell on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s legs and let out a hot breath.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock is so pretty.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2014-.\u201d\u201cFuck, don\u2019t show this cute cock to anyone but me.\u201dInseop\u2019s breathing became increasingly difficult because of the movement of the hand rubbing between his legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked several times if he was okay and kissed the nape of his neck.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it slow.\u201dIt was hard to resist because the bottom was hot, but Lee Wooyeon moved his body as slowly as possible so that Inseop did not overdo it.\u00a0Inseop, who was under Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body, started breathing more and more, and finally, with tears in his eyes, he grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u00a0Should I go slower?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u201cThen tell me what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Too\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s too slow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my head, \u2026 is muddled.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too slow\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my\u00a0body\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon said fuck and cursed and made Inseop sit up.\u00a0By making Inseop\u2019s legs spread apart, he pushed in his wet cock.\u00a0Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder and took a deep breath.\u00a0His genitals were half entered through the narrow hole.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon exhaled and held it in.\u201cThere\u2019s more to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWe still have half left.\u00a0Breathe in, so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed in the remaining at once.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body dropped and he let out a loud moan.\u201cGood job.\u00a0I\u2019m all in now, so I\u2019ll move in a little bit.\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0His stomach was tingling and his bottom was burning, so he just wanted him to do something, anything.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Now, if I move, Inseop will get hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026Me\u2026it\u2019s hot down there\u2026\u201dEven though he didn;t even touch him, Inseop\u2019s genitals slowly hardened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clenched his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll move then,\u201d and raised his waist slowly.\u00a0A quiet moan escaped Inseop\u2019s lips.Lee Wooyeon slid back and moved his waist forward.\u00a0The gaping hole made a squeaky gurgling sound and sucked in his flesh.\u00a0Cold sweat formed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead as he tried to suppress the seething desire.Choi Inseop, too, was suffering, panting for breath, as if he was about to fall, and the sensations below that seemed to sting.\u201cWooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please, \u2026Underneath, it\u2019s hot\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his teeth desperately.\u00a0His lips ripped open and blood flowed, and he tried his best to resist the urge.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Then, Inseop will move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work, so you can move as you please.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed Inseop\u2019s body up, and he lay down on the bed.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face turned even redder than before when he sat down on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thigh.\u201cI won\u2019t move, so you move.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmuteLee Wooyeon took his hand away from Inseop\u2019s body and said.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at him with tears in his eyes.\u201cMove your back.\u00a0Loosen up the hole a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0ugh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you tighten it too much, it hurts, yes, up and down, ha\u2026ha\u2026\u00a0you just need to move your hips on it.\u00a0With my dick in your ass, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ha.\u00a0Good job.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon instructed, Inseop moved his waist.\u00a0Every time his buttocks touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thighs, his genitals touched his stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled Inseop\u2019s hand and made him touch his genitals.\u201cInseop, try touching it yourself.\u201dWhen he moved his hands entwined with his still-hot genitals, the front and back were stimulated, and Inseop went crazy.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0ah\u2026\u00a0\u201dWatching him shake his back and move his hands in a trance, Lee Wo-yeon bit his teeth.\u00a0Being unable to move even in front of a superb view was like a kind of torture to him.\u201cAhhh!\u00a0Wooyeon ah, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ah!\u201dThe contraction of the hole was faster than before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t take it any longer, so he got up, hugging Inseop.\u00a0He let out a groan, and pounded his waist between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Inseop, who reached his climax with a single shovel, stretched out on the bed, screaming, out of breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pounded his waist a few more times and ejaculated inside Inseop\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWith his eyes wide open, Lee Wooyeon, who exhaled at the peak of pleasure, gradually regained his reason.\u00a0When he found Inseop breathing hard under his body, he shouted in shock.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Shall we go to the hospital?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I \u2026I couldn\u2019t stand it until the end.\u201dIn the end, he thought it was like this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop, who was drenched in sweat and was out of breath, and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dInseop had less strength and embraced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body with his slightly trembling hands.\u00a0He wanted to do this.\u00a0At that time, he wanted to tell Lee Wooyeon, who came to him that night, while hugging him like this.\u201cI am fine.\u00a0I\u2019m stronger than you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to be so sorry about.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u00a0It\u2019s all my choice\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t hard, but that\u2019s okay.\u201dInseop poured out all the words he wanted to say that day.\u201cMy heart is strong.\u00a0Not that weak.\u00a0It\u2019s survived several surgeries, it\u2019s Jennie\u2019s last gift, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Above all, I endured Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0So I think it\u2019s fine.\u00a0So, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a heart that has been trained as a madman.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tone was filled with laughter.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and laughed along.\u00a0The two held each other other for a while.\u2018Sleep when you\u2019re sleepy.\u2019Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s hair and whispered.A heartbeat could be heard from the overlaid body.\u00a0When the two sounds sounded like one, Inseop could fall asleep in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms.In the dim light, a man opened an orange letterhead and read the letter.\u00a0Just like he always dreamed of.When Inseop opened his eyes, he reached out and stroked his arm, wondering if the man next to him was real and not a dreamer.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dA friendly voice was heard.\u00a0Inseop was relieved by the voice, closed his eyes and smiled.\u201cSleep more.\u00a0It\u2019s still night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0call home\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI did it before.\u00a0I told them it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you, so you\u2019ll be late.\u201dLee Wooyeon wrapped Inseop\u2019s hair on his fingertips, fiddling around with him, and telling him kind words.\u201cI read the letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe letter that Inseop gave me\u2026\u00a0To think that I have been there before and haven\u2019t read it makes me angry at the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0After all, I didn\u2019t write the content.\u201d\u201cStill, Inseop wrote it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to read it,\u201d he said in Inseop\u2019s ear, a voice that subsided with a sigh.\u00a0Closing his eyes and letting his mind wander, Inseop asked about Kate, as if in a sleep talk.\u201cWhere is she hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0She\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0I water once every three days.\u00a0In a well-ventilated place, and I don\u2019t bother.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, who memorized the words he had been asked to deliver, Inseop gave a small laugh.\u201cAfter seeing Inseop\u2019s letter, I wanted to make an excuse somehow.\u00a0So, I put Kate in my bag and bought a plane ticket to America.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dPlants were strictly prohibited items.\u00a0In some cases, if one was caught hiding something like that, they will be banned from entering the country.\u00a0Inseop was unable to speak properly at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s recklessness.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You didn\u2019t know I was this crazy, do you regret that we got involved for nothing?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0But even if you regret\u00a0\u2026 it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs if Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice sounded gloomy as he said that, Inseop reached out and placed his hand on his finger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop.\u00a0Inseop moved his fingers and put his finger between Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingers.And he gave strength to his fingers.\u201cMore\u2026\u00a0You can tie me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to keep living, tied up to you.\u201dIf Lee Wooyeon likes it.At the end, Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand as if he was talking to himself.\u00a0Knowing what the hand holding him tightly meant, Inseop put his head on his hand and closed his eyes.Rare, rare, sleep rushed in, and he feltLee Wooyeon\u2019s friendly touch.\u00a0A friendly voice coexisting in dream and reality put Inseop into a deep sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

and opened them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I recently went to the doctor.\u00a0He\u2019s a doctor I\u2019ve been seeing since I was little\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHearing Inseop\u2019s words,

didn\u2019t take off his clothes first.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon unbuttoned his shirt with one hand and looked at Inseop.\u00a0He was asking him to take it off.Inseop loosened the belt of his pants and unzipped his pants.\u00a0In the quiet room, there was an unusually loud sound of the zipper being lowered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon swallowed hard.\u00a0Inseop lowered his pants and took off his shoes.\u00a0When he took off his socks and put them next to his pants, he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s piercing gaze and his shoulders shook involuntarily.\u201cTake your top off as

were going to be all naked, biting and sucking, but Lee Wooyeon turned his head back as Inseop asked.\u201cIs it done?\u201d\u201cNot yet, wait a minute.\u201dHe heard the sound of Inseop taking off his clothes.\u00a0The sound of the hem of his clothes rubbing against his skin and falling off his feet made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath warm.\u201cAre you all naked?\u201d\u201cYe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon turned his head, Inseop, who was not wearing a single thing, stood there with his head bowed as if embarrassed.Lee Wooyeon, who looked at him as if possessed, held out his hand.\u201cCome here.\u201dInseop crouched and walked towards him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon held him in his arms and stood still for a while.\u00a0When he didn\u2019t do anything to him, Inseop got a little scared.\u00a0There were surgical scars around the chest, but he was worried that he might not like the body that had scars on the back as well.\u201cInseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice softly called out his name.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou said it was okay to have similar feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cLike a normal person, I like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI like you, Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I see Inseop, I want to hug you, I want to touch you, I want to have you by my side somehow, and if I don\u2019t see you, I think I\u2019ll go crazy.\u00a0So far, it\u2019s just normal feelings, but I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s not the end.\u201dInseop could barely guess what Lee Wooyeon\u2019s twisted feelings were.\u00a0It was the result of experiencing and realizing his dark abyss through a series of events.\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry for saying this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine.\u201dInseop said, giving strength to the arm that embraced Lee Wooyeon.\u201cEven if it\u2019s like that, I\u2019m fine so \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I wish you could tell me that you like me.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cMore.\u00a0Once more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dInseop burst into tears and buried his face in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s chest.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon kissed him.\u00a0Both bodies fell on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s legs and let out a hot breath.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock is so pretty.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2014-.\u201d\u201cFuck, don\u2019t show this cute cock to anyone but me.\u201dInseop\u2019s breathing became increasingly difficult because of the movement of the hand rubbing between his legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked several times if he was okay and kissed the nape of his neck.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it slow.\u201dIt was hard to resist because the bottom was hot, but Lee Wooyeon moved his body as slowly as possible so that Inseop did not overdo it.\u00a0Inseop, who was under Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body, started breathing more and more, and finally, with tears in his eyes, he grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u00a0Should I go slower?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u201cThen tell me what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Too\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s too slow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my head, \u2026 is muddled.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too slow\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my\u00a0body\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon said fuck and cursed and made Inseop sit up.\u00a0By making Inseop\u2019s legs spread apart, he pushed in his wet cock.\u00a0Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder and took a deep breath.\u00a0His genitals were half entered through the narrow hole.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon exhaled and held it in.\u201cThere\u2019s more to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWe still have half left.\u00a0Breathe in, so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed in the remaining at once.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body dropped and he let out a loud moan.\u201cGood job.\u00a0I\u2019m all in now, so I\u2019ll move in a little bit.\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0His stomach was tingling and his bottom was burning, so he just wanted him to do something, anything.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Now, if I move, Inseop will get hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026Me\u2026it\u2019s hot down there\u2026\u201dEven though he didn;t even touch him, Inseop\u2019s genitals slowly hardened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clenched his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll move then,\u201d and raised his waist slowly.\u00a0A quiet moan escaped Inseop\u2019s lips.Lee Wooyeon slid back and moved his waist forward.\u00a0The gaping hole made a squeaky gurgling sound and sucked in his flesh.\u00a0Cold sweat formed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead as he tried to suppress the seething desire.Choi Inseop, too, was suffering, panting for breath, as if he was about to fall, and the sensations below that seemed to sting.\u201cWooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please, \u2026Underneath, it\u2019s hot\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his teeth desperately.\u00a0His lips ripped open and blood flowed, and he tried his best to resist the urge.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Then, Inseop will move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work, so you can move as you please.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed Inseop\u2019s body up, and he lay down on the bed.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face turned even redder than before when he sat down on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thigh.\u201cI won\u2019t move, so you move.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmuteLee Wooyeon took his hand away from Inseop\u2019s body and said.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at him with tears in his eyes.\u201cMove your back.\u00a0Loosen up the hole a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0ugh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you tighten it too much, it hurts, yes, up and down, ha\u2026ha\u2026\u00a0you just need to move your hips on it.\u00a0With my dick in your ass, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ha.\u00a0Good job.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon instructed, Inseop moved his waist.\u00a0Every time his buttocks touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thighs, his genitals touched his stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled Inseop\u2019s hand and made him touch his genitals.\u201cInseop, try touching it yourself.\u201dWhen he moved his hands entwined with his still-hot genitals, the front and back were stimulated, and Inseop went crazy.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0ah\u2026\u00a0\u201dWatching him shake his back and move his hands in a trance, Lee Wo-yeon bit his teeth.\u00a0Being unable to move even in front of a superb view was like a kind of torture to him.\u201cAhhh!\u00a0Wooyeon ah, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ah!\u201dThe contraction of the hole was faster than before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t take it any longer, so he got up, hugging Inseop.\u00a0He let out a groan, and pounded his waist between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Inseop, who reached his climax with a single shovel, stretched out on the bed, screaming, out of breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pounded his waist a few more times and ejaculated inside Inseop\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWith his eyes wide open, Lee Wooyeon, who exhaled at the peak of pleasure, gradually regained his reason.\u00a0When he found Inseop breathing hard under his body, he shouted in shock.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Shall we go to the hospital?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I \u2026I couldn\u2019t stand it until the end.\u201dIn the end, he thought it was like this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop, who was drenched in sweat and was out of breath, and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dInseop had less strength and embraced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body with his slightly trembling hands.\u00a0He wanted to do this.\u00a0At that time, he wanted to tell Lee Wooyeon, who came to him that night, while hugging him like this.\u201cI am fine.\u00a0I\u2019m stronger than you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to be so sorry about.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u00a0It\u2019s all my choice\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t hard, but that\u2019s okay.\u201dInseop poured out all the words he wanted to say that day.\u201cMy heart is strong.\u00a0Not that weak.\u00a0It\u2019s survived several surgeries, it\u2019s Jennie\u2019s last gift, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Above all, I endured Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0So I think it\u2019s fine.\u00a0So, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a heart that has been trained as a madman.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tone was filled with laughter.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and laughed along.\u00a0The two held each other other for a while.\u2018Sleep when you\u2019re sleepy.\u2019Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s hair and whispered.A heartbeat could be heard from the overlaid body.\u00a0When the two sounds sounded like one, Inseop could fall asleep in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms.In the dim light, a man opened an orange letterhead and read the letter.\u00a0Just like he always dreamed of.When Inseop opened his eyes, he reached out and stroked his arm, wondering if the man next to him was real and not a dreamer.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dA friendly voice was heard.\u00a0Inseop was relieved by the voice, closed his eyes and smiled.\u201cSleep more.\u00a0It\u2019s still night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0call home\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI did it before.\u00a0I told them it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you, so you\u2019ll be late.\u201dLee Wooyeon wrapped Inseop\u2019s hair on his fingertips, fiddling around with him, and telling him kind words.\u201cI read the letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe letter that Inseop gave me\u2026\u00a0To think that I have been there before and haven\u2019t read it makes me angry at the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0After all, I didn\u2019t write the content.\u201d\u201cStill, Inseop wrote it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to read it,\u201d he said in Inseop\u2019s ear, a voice that subsided with a sigh.\u00a0Closing his eyes and letting his mind wander, Inseop asked about Kate, as if in a sleep talk.\u201cWhere is she hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0She\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0I water once every three days.\u00a0In a well-ventilated place, and I don\u2019t bother.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, who memorized the words he had been asked to deliver, Inseop gave a small laugh.\u201cAfter seeing Inseop\u2019s letter, I wanted to make an excuse somehow.\u00a0So, I put Kate in my bag and bought a plane ticket to America.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dPlants were strictly prohibited items.\u00a0In some cases, if one was caught hiding something like that, they will be banned from entering the country.\u00a0Inseop was unable to speak properly at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s recklessness.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You didn\u2019t know I was this crazy, do you regret that we got involved for nothing?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0But even if you regret\u00a0\u2026 it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs if Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice sounded gloomy as he said that, Inseop reached out and placed his hand on his finger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop.\u00a0Inseop moved his fingers and put his finger between Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingers.And he gave strength to his fingers.\u201cMore\u2026\u00a0You can tie me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to keep living, tied up to you.\u201dIf Lee Wooyeon likes it.At the end, Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand as if he was talking to himself.\u00a0Knowing what the hand holding him tightly meant, Inseop put his head on his hand and closed his eyes.Rare, rare, sleep rushed in, and he feltLee Wooyeon\u2019s friendly touch.\u00a0A friendly voice coexisting in dream and reality put Inseop into a deep sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

82Translated by NaralaraEdited by NaralaraWhen the hotel door closed, Lee Wooyeon ran like a hungry person and kissed Inseop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t speak until Inseop, who was out of breath, gasped and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon put Inseop next to him and said.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I thought I was going to be like this, so I didn\u2019t want to see you for a while.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t have the confidence not to force Inseop to be next to him.\u00a0When he saw him, he wanted to touch him, and when he touched him, he got greedy, he wanted him, and he wanted to hold him in his arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dHe said as he straightened Inseop\u2019s disheveled collar.\u00a0Inseop asked why?\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0When your heart is strained, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I heard you needed to take it easy.\u201dAfter listening to the doctor\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon decided to send Inseop to the United States.\u00a0For the time being, he wanted to free Inseop from noisy problems, but above all, he was not confident that he would not touch him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you to the United States, but it\u2019s really not worth it.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and stroked Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0Inseop slowly closed his eyes once and opened them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I recently went to the doctor.\u00a0He\u2019s a doctor I\u2019ve been seeing since I was little\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHearing Inseop\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon kissed the top of his head.\u00a0Right now, he wanted to hug his body and go inside him, but he managed to hold on with reason.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Aren\u2019t you curious what I asked?\u201dInseop\u2019s face was flushed red.\u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d\u201cCa, can I do it\u2026\u00a0The doctor said if I don\u2019t overdo it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s clothes and kissed him roughly.\u00a0Inseop also tried his best to match his gestures and took off his clothes.\u00a0With his left hand, he didn\u2019t move as well as he thought, and Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue as if impatiently.\u201cI will\u2026\u00a0I will take it off.\u201dThinking that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s injured hand might be hurting, Inseop mustered up the courage and said.\u201cInseop, are you going to take it off?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCrossing the sea, good things happen.\u201dInseop was so shy that he didn\u2019t take off his clothes first.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon unbuttoned his shirt with one hand and looked at Inseop.\u00a0He was asking him to take it off.Inseop loosened the belt of his pants and unzipped his pants.\u00a0In the quiet room, there was an unusually loud sound of the zipper being lowered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon swallowed hard.\u00a0Inseop lowered his pants and took off his shoes.\u00a0When he took off his socks and put them next to his pants, he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s piercing gaze and his shoulders shook involuntarily.\u201cTake your top off as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOr will you take off your panties first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, could you please turn your head for a moment?\u201dIn a while, they were going to be all naked, biting and sucking, but Lee Wooyeon turned his head back as Inseop asked.\u201cIs it done?\u201d\u201cNot yet, wait a minute.\u201dHe heard the sound of Inseop taking off his clothes.\u00a0The sound of the hem of his clothes rubbing against his skin and falling off his feet made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath warm.\u201cAre you all naked?\u201d\u201cYe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon turned his head, Inseop, who was not wearing a single thing, stood there with his head bowed as if embarrassed.Lee Wooyeon, who looked at him as if possessed, held out his hand.\u201cCome here.\u201dInseop crouched and walked towards him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon held him in his arms and stood still for a while.\u00a0When he didn\u2019t do anything to him, Inseop got a little scared.\u00a0There were surgical scars around the chest, but he was worried that he might not like the body that had scars on the back as well.\u201cInseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice softly called out his name.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou said it was okay to have similar feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cLike a normal person, I like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI like you, Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I see Inseop, I want to hug you, I want to touch you, I want to have you by my side somehow, and if I don\u2019t see you, I think I\u2019ll go crazy.\u00a0So far, it\u2019s just normal feelings, but I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s not the end.\u201dInseop could barely guess what Lee Wooyeon\u2019s twisted feelings were.\u00a0It was the result of experiencing and realizing his dark abyss through a series of events.\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry for saying this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine.\u201dInseop said, giving strength to the arm that embraced Lee Wooyeon.\u201cEven if it\u2019s like that, I\u2019m fine so \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I wish you could tell me that you like me.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cMore.\u00a0Once more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dInseop burst into tears and buried his face in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s chest.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon kissed him.\u00a0Both bodies fell on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s legs and let out a hot breath.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock is so pretty.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2014-.\u201d\u201cFuck, don\u2019t show this cute cock to anyone but me.\u201dInseop\u2019s breathing became increasingly difficult because of the movement of the hand rubbing between his legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked several times if he was okay and kissed the nape of his neck.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it slow.\u201dIt was hard to resist because the bottom was hot, but Lee Wooyeon moved his body as slowly as possible so that Inseop did not overdo it.\u00a0Inseop, who was under Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body, started breathing more and more, and finally, with tears in his eyes, he grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u00a0Should I go slower?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u201cThen tell me what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Too\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s too slow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my head, \u2026 is muddled.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too slow\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my\u00a0body\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon said fuck and cursed and made Inseop sit up.\u00a0By making Inseop\u2019s legs spread apart, he pushed in his wet cock.\u00a0Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder and took a deep breath.\u00a0His genitals were half entered through the narrow hole.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon exhaled and held it in.\u201cThere\u2019s more to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWe still have half left.\u00a0Breathe in, so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed in the remaining at once.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body dropped and he let out a loud moan.\u201cGood job.\u00a0I\u2019m all in now, so I\u2019ll move in a little bit.\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0His stomach was tingling and his bottom was burning, so he just wanted him to do something, anything.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Now, if I move, Inseop will get hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026Me\u2026it\u2019s hot down there\u2026\u201dEven though he didn;t even touch him, Inseop\u2019s genitals slowly hardened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clenched his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll move then,\u201d and raised his waist slowly.\u00a0A quiet moan escaped Inseop\u2019s lips.Lee Wooyeon slid back and moved his waist forward.\u00a0The gaping hole made a squeaky gurgling sound and sucked in his flesh.\u00a0Cold sweat formed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead as he tried to suppress the seething desire.Choi Inseop, too, was suffering, panting for breath, as if he was about to fall, and the sensations below that seemed to sting.\u201cWooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please, \u2026Underneath, it\u2019s hot\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his teeth desperately.\u00a0His lips ripped open and blood flowed, and he tried his best to resist the urge.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Then, Inseop will move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work, so you can move as you please.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed Inseop\u2019s body up, and he lay down on the bed.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face turned even redder than before when he sat down on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thigh.\u201cI won\u2019t move, so you move.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmuteLee Wooyeon took his hand away from Inseop\u2019s body and said.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at him with tears in his eyes.\u201cMove your back.\u00a0Loosen up the hole a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0ugh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you tighten it too much, it hurts, yes, up and down, ha\u2026ha\u2026\u00a0you just need to move your hips on it.\u00a0With my dick in your ass, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ha.\u00a0Good job.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon instructed, Inseop moved his waist.\u00a0Every time his buttocks touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thighs, his genitals touched his stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled Inseop\u2019s hand and made him touch his genitals.\u201cInseop, try touching it yourself.\u201dWhen he moved his hands entwined with his still-hot genitals, the front and back were stimulated, and Inseop went crazy.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0ah\u2026\u00a0\u201dWatching him shake his back and move his hands in a trance, Lee Wo-yeon bit his teeth.\u00a0Being unable to move even in front of a superb view was like a kind of torture to him.\u201cAhhh!\u00a0Wooyeon ah, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ah!\u201dThe contraction of the hole was faster than before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t take it any longer, so he got up, hugging Inseop.\u00a0He let out a groan, and pounded his waist between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Inseop, who reached his climax with a single shovel, stretched out on the bed, screaming, out of breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pounded his waist a few more times and ejaculated inside Inseop\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWith his eyes wide open, Lee Wooyeon, who exhaled at the peak of pleasure, gradually regained his reason.\u00a0When he found Inseop breathing hard under his body, he shouted in shock.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Shall we go to the hospital?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I \u2026I couldn\u2019t stand it until the end.\u201dIn the end, he thought it was like this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop, who was drenched in sweat and was out of breath, and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dInseop had less strength and embraced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body with his slightly trembling hands.\u00a0He wanted to do this.\u00a0At that time, he wanted to tell Lee Wooyeon, who came to him that night, while hugging him like this.\u201cI am fine.\u00a0I\u2019m stronger than you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to be so sorry about.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u00a0It\u2019s all my choice\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t hard, but that\u2019s okay.\u201dInseop poured out all the words he wanted to say that day.\u201cMy heart is strong.\u00a0Not that weak.\u00a0It\u2019s survived several surgeries, it\u2019s Jennie\u2019s last gift, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Above all, I endured Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0So I think it\u2019s fine.\u00a0So, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a heart that has been trained as a madman.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tone was filled with laughter.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and laughed along.\u00a0The two held each other other for a while.\u2018Sleep when you\u2019re sleepy.\u2019Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s hair and whispered.A heartbeat could be heard from the overlaid body.\u00a0When the two sounds sounded like one, Inseop could fall asleep in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms.In the dim light, a man opened an orange letterhead and read the letter.\u00a0Just like he always dreamed of.When Inseop opened his eyes, he reached out and stroked his arm, wondering if the man next to him was real and not a dreamer.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dA friendly voice was heard.\u00a0Inseop was relieved by the voice, closed his eyes and smiled.\u201cSleep more.\u00a0It\u2019s still night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0call home\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI did it before.\u00a0I told them it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you, so you\u2019ll be late.\u201dLee Wooyeon wrapped Inseop\u2019s hair on his fingertips, fiddling around with him, and telling him kind words.\u201cI read the letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe letter that Inseop gave me\u2026\u00a0To think that I have been there before and haven\u2019t read it makes me angry at the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0After all, I didn\u2019t write the content.\u201d\u201cStill, Inseop wrote it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to read it,\u201d he said in Inseop\u2019s ear, a voice that subsided with a sigh.\u00a0Closing his eyes and letting his mind wander, Inseop asked about Kate, as if in a sleep talk.\u201cWhere is she hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0She\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0I water once every three days.\u00a0In a well-ventilated place, and I don\u2019t bother.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, who memorized the words he had been asked to deliver, Inseop gave a small laugh.\u201cAfter seeing Inseop\u2019s letter, I wanted to make an excuse somehow.\u00a0So, I put Kate in my bag and bought a plane ticket to America.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dPlants were strictly prohibited items.\u00a0In some cases, if one was caught hiding something like that, they will be banned from entering the country.\u00a0Inseop was unable to speak properly at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s recklessness.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You didn\u2019t know I was this crazy, do you regret that we got involved for nothing?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0But even if you regret\u00a0\u2026 it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs if Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice sounded gloomy as he said that, Inseop reached out and placed his hand on his finger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop.\u00a0Inseop moved his fingers and put his finger between Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingers.And he gave strength to his fingers.\u201cMore\u2026\u00a0You can tie me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to keep living, tied up to you.\u201dIf Lee Wooyeon likes it.At the end, Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand as if he was talking to himself.\u00a0Knowing what the hand holding him tightly meant, Inseop put his head on his hand and closed his eyes.Rare, rare, sleep rushed in, and he feltLee Wooyeon\u2019s friendly touch.\u00a0A friendly voice coexisting in dream and reality put Inseop into a deep sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

82Translated by NaralaraEdited by NaralaraWhen the hotel door closed, Lee Wooyeon ran like a hungry person and kissed Inseop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t speak until Inseop, who was out of breath, gasped and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon put Inseop next to him and said.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I thought I was going to be like this, so I didn\u2019t want to see you for a while.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t have the confidence not to force Inseop to be next to him.\u00a0When he saw him, he wanted to touch him, and when he touched him, he got greedy, he wanted him, and he wanted to hold him in his arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dHe said as he straightened Inseop\u2019s disheveled collar.\u00a0Inseop asked why?\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0When your heart is strained, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I heard you needed to take it easy.\u201dAfter listening to the doctor\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon decided to send Inseop to the United States.\u00a0For the time being, he wanted to free Inseop from noisy problems, but above all, he was not confident that he would not touch him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you to the United States, but it\u2019s really not worth it.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and stroked Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0Inseop slowly closed his eyes once and opened them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I recently went to the doctor.\u00a0He\u2019s a doctor I\u2019ve been seeing since I was little\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHearing Inseop\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon kissed the top of his head.\u00a0Right now, he wanted to hug his body and go inside him, but he managed to hold on with reason.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Aren\u2019t you curious what I asked?\u201dInseop\u2019s face was flushed red.\u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d\u201cCa, can I do it\u2026\u00a0The doctor said if I don\u2019t overdo it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s clothes and kissed him roughly.\u00a0Inseop also tried his best to match his gestures and took off his clothes.\u00a0With his left hand, he didn\u2019t move as well as he thought, and Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue as if impatiently.\u201cI will\u2026\u00a0I will take it off.\u201dThinking that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s injured hand might be hurting, Inseop mustered up the courage and said.\u201cInseop, are you going to take it off?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCrossing the sea, good things happen.\u201dInseop was so shy that he didn\u2019t take off his clothes first.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon unbuttoned his shirt with one hand and looked at Inseop.\u00a0He was asking him to take it off.Inseop loosened the belt of his pants and unzipped his pants.\u00a0In the quiet room, there was an unusually loud sound of the zipper being lowered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon swallowed hard.\u00a0Inseop lowered his pants and took off his shoes.\u00a0When he took off his socks and put them next to his pants, he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s piercing gaze and his shoulders shook involuntarily.\u201cTake your top off as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOr will you take off your panties first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, could you please turn your head for a moment?\u201dIn a while, they were going to be all naked, biting and sucking, but Lee Wooyeon turned his head back as Inseop asked.\u201cIs it done?\u201d\u201cNot yet, wait a minute.\u201dHe heard the sound of Inseop taking off his clothes.\u00a0The sound of the hem of his clothes rubbing against his skin and falling off his feet made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath warm.\u201cAre you all naked?\u201d\u201cYe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon turned his head, Inseop, who was not wearing a single thing, stood there with his head bowed as if embarrassed.Lee Wooyeon, who looked at him as if possessed, held out his hand.\u201cCome here.\u201dInseop crouched and walked towards him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon held him in his arms and stood still for a while.\u00a0When he didn\u2019t do anything to him, Inseop got a little scared.\u00a0There were surgical scars around the chest, but he was worried that he might not like the body that had scars on the back as well.\u201cInseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice softly called out his name.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou said it was okay to have similar feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cLike a normal person, I like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI like you, Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I see Inseop, I want to hug you, I want to touch you, I want to have you by my side somehow, and if I don\u2019t see you, I think I\u2019ll go crazy.\u00a0So far, it\u2019s just normal feelings, but I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s not the end.\u201dInseop could barely guess what Lee Wooyeon\u2019s twisted feelings were.\u00a0It was the result of experiencing and realizing his dark abyss through a series of events.\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry for saying this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine.\u201dInseop said, giving strength to the arm that embraced Lee Wooyeon.\u201cEven if it\u2019s like that, I\u2019m fine so \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I wish you could tell me that you like me.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cMore.\u00a0Once more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dInseop burst into tears and buried his face in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s chest.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon kissed him.\u00a0Both bodies fell on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s legs and let out a hot breath.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock is so pretty.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2014-.\u201d\u201cFuck, don\u2019t show this cute cock to anyone but me.\u201dInseop\u2019s breathing became increasingly difficult because of the movement of the hand rubbing between his legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked several times if he was okay and kissed the nape of his neck.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it slow.\u201dIt was hard to resist because the bottom was hot, but Lee Wooyeon moved his body as slowly as possible so that Inseop did not overdo it.\u00a0Inseop, who was under Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body, started breathing more and more, and finally, with tears in his eyes, he grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u00a0Should I go slower?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u201cThen tell me what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Too\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s too slow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my head, \u2026 is muddled.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too slow\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my\u00a0body\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon said fuck and cursed and made Inseop sit up.\u00a0By making Inseop\u2019s legs spread apart, he pushed in his wet cock.\u00a0Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder and took a deep breath.\u00a0His genitals were half entered through the narrow hole.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon exhaled and held it in.\u201cThere\u2019s more to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWe still have half left.\u00a0Breathe in, so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed in the remaining at once.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body dropped and he let out a loud moan.\u201cGood job.\u00a0I\u2019m all in now, so I\u2019ll move in a little bit.\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0His stomach was tingling and his bottom was burning, so he just wanted him to do something, anything.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Now, if I move, Inseop will get hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026Me\u2026it\u2019s hot down there\u2026\u201dEven though he didn;t even touch him, Inseop\u2019s genitals slowly hardened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clenched his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll move then,\u201d and raised his waist slowly.\u00a0A quiet moan escaped Inseop\u2019s lips.Lee Wooyeon slid back and moved his waist forward.\u00a0The gaping hole made a squeaky gurgling sound and sucked in his flesh.\u00a0Cold sweat formed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead as he tried to suppress the seething desire.Choi Inseop, too, was suffering, panting for breath, as if he was about to fall, and the sensations below that seemed to sting.\u201cWooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please, \u2026Underneath, it\u2019s hot\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his teeth desperately.\u00a0His lips ripped open and blood flowed, and he tried his best to resist the urge.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Then, Inseop will move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work, so you can move as you please.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed Inseop\u2019s body up, and he lay down on the bed.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face turned even redder than before when he sat down on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thigh.\u201cI won\u2019t move, so you move.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmuteLee Wooyeon took his hand away from Inseop\u2019s body and said.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at him with tears in his eyes.\u201cMove your back.\u00a0Loosen up the hole a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0ugh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you tighten it too much, it hurts, yes, up and down, ha\u2026ha\u2026\u00a0you just need to move your hips on it.\u00a0With my dick in your ass, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ha.\u00a0Good job.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon instructed, Inseop moved his waist.\u00a0Every time his buttocks touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thighs, his genitals touched his stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled Inseop\u2019s hand and made him touch his genitals.\u201cInseop, try touching it yourself.\u201dWhen he moved his hands entwined with his still-hot genitals, the front and back were stimulated, and Inseop went crazy.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0ah\u2026\u00a0\u201dWatching him shake his back and move his hands in a trance, Lee Wo-yeon bit his teeth.\u00a0Being unable to move even in front of a superb view was like a kind of torture to him.\u201cAhhh!\u00a0Wooyeon ah, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ah!\u201dThe contraction of the hole was faster than before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t take it any longer, so he got up, hugging Inseop.\u00a0He let out a groan, and pounded his waist between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Inseop, who reached his climax with a single shovel, stretched out on the bed, screaming, out of breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pounded his waist a few more times and ejaculated inside Inseop\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWith his eyes wide open, Lee Wooyeon, who exhaled at the peak of pleasure, gradually regained his reason.\u00a0When he found Inseop breathing hard under his body, he shouted in shock.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Shall we go to the hospital?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I \u2026I couldn\u2019t stand it until the end.\u201dIn the end, he thought it was like this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop, who was drenched in sweat and was out of breath, and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dInseop had less strength and embraced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body with his slightly trembling hands.\u00a0He wanted to do this.\u00a0At that time, he wanted to tell Lee Wooyeon, who came to him that night, while hugging him like this.\u201cI am fine.\u00a0I\u2019m stronger than you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to be so sorry about.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u00a0It\u2019s all my choice\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t hard, but that\u2019s okay.\u201dInseop poured out all the words he wanted to say that day.\u201cMy heart is strong.\u00a0Not that weak.\u00a0It\u2019s survived several surgeries, it\u2019s Jennie\u2019s last gift, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Above all, I endured Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0So I think it\u2019s fine.\u00a0So, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a heart that has been trained as a madman.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tone was filled with laughter.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and laughed along.\u00a0The two held each other other for a while.\u2018Sleep when you\u2019re sleepy.\u2019Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s hair and whispered.A heartbeat could be heard from the overlaid body.\u00a0When the two sounds sounded like one, Inseop could fall asleep in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms.In the dim light, a man opened an orange letterhead and read the letter.\u00a0Just like he always dreamed of.When Inseop opened his eyes, he reached out and stroked his arm, wondering if the man next to him was real and not a dreamer.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dA friendly voice was heard.\u00a0Inseop was relieved by the voice, closed his eyes and smiled.\u201cSleep more.\u00a0It\u2019s still night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0call home\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI did it before.\u00a0I told them it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you, so you\u2019ll be late.\u201dLee Wooyeon wrapped Inseop\u2019s hair on his fingertips, fiddling around with him, and telling him kind words.\u201cI read the letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe letter that Inseop gave me\u2026\u00a0To think that I have been there before and haven\u2019t read it makes me angry at the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0After all, I didn\u2019t write the content.\u201d\u201cStill, Inseop wrote it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to read it,\u201d he said in Inseop\u2019s ear, a voice that subsided with a sigh.\u00a0Closing his eyes and letting his mind wander, Inseop asked about Kate, as if in a sleep talk.\u201cWhere is she hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0She\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0I water once every three days.\u00a0In a well-ventilated place, and I don\u2019t bother.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, who memorized the words he had been asked to deliver, Inseop gave a small laugh.\u201cAfter seeing Inseop\u2019s letter, I wanted to make an excuse somehow.\u00a0So, I put Kate in my bag and bought a plane ticket to America.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dPlants were strictly prohibited items.\u00a0In some cases, if one was caught hiding something like that, they will be banned from entering the country.\u00a0Inseop was unable to speak properly at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s recklessness.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You didn\u2019t know I was this crazy, do you regret that we got involved for nothing?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0But even if you regret\u00a0\u2026 it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs if Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice sounded gloomy as he said that, Inseop reached out and placed his hand on his finger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop.\u00a0Inseop moved his fingers and put his finger between Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingers.And he gave strength to his fingers.\u201cMore\u2026\u00a0You can tie me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to keep living, tied up to you.\u201dIf Lee Wooyeon likes it.At the end, Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand as if he was talking to himself.\u00a0Knowing what the hand holding him tightly meant, Inseop put his head on his hand and closed his eyes.Rare, rare, sleep rushed in, and he feltLee Wooyeon\u2019s friendly touch.\u00a0A friendly voice coexisting in dream and reality put Inseop into a deep sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

82Translated by NaralaraEdited by NaralaraWhen the hotel door closed, Lee Wooyeon ran like a hungry person and kissed Inseop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t speak until Inseop, who was out of breath, gasped and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon put Inseop next to him and said.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I thought I was going to be like this, so I didn\u2019t want to see you for a while.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t have the confidence not to force Inseop to be next to him.\u00a0When he saw him, he wanted to touch him, and when he touched him, he got greedy, he wanted him, and he wanted to hold him in his arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dHe said as he straightened Inseop\u2019s disheveled collar.\u00a0Inseop asked why?\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0When your heart is strained, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I heard you needed to take it easy.\u201dAfter listening to the doctor\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon decided to send Inseop to the United States.\u00a0For the time being, he wanted to free Inseop from noisy problems, but above all, he was not confident that he would not touch him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you to the United States, but it\u2019s really not worth it.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and stroked Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0Inseop slowly closed his eyes once and opened them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I recently went to the doctor.\u00a0He\u2019s a doctor I\u2019ve been seeing since I was little\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHearing Inseop\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon kissed the top of his head.\u00a0Right now, he wanted to hug his body and go inside him, but he managed to hold on with reason.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Aren\u2019t you curious what I asked?\u201dInseop\u2019s face was flushed red.\u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d\u201cCa, can I do it\u2026\u00a0The doctor said if I don\u2019t overdo it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s clothes and kissed him roughly.\u00a0Inseop also tried his best to match his gestures and took off his clothes.\u00a0With his left hand, he didn\u2019t move as well as he thought, and Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue as if impatiently.\u201cI will\u2026\u00a0I will take it off.\u201dThinking that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s injured hand might be hurting, Inseop mustered up the courage and said.\u201cInseop, are you going to take it off?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCrossing the sea, good things happen.\u201dInseop was so shy that he didn\u2019t take off his clothes first.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon unbuttoned his shirt with one hand and looked at Inseop.\u00a0He was asking him to take it off.Inseop loosened the belt of his pants and unzipped his pants.\u00a0In the quiet room, there was an unusually loud sound of the zipper being lowered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon swallowed hard.\u00a0Inseop lowered his pants and took off his shoes.\u00a0When he took off his socks and put them next to his pants, he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s piercing gaze and his shoulders shook involuntarily.\u201cTake your top off as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOr will you take off your panties first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, could you please turn your head for a moment?\u201dIn a while, they were going to be all naked, biting and sucking, but Lee Wooyeon turned his head back as Inseop asked.\u201cIs it done?\u201d\u201cNot yet, wait a minute.\u201dHe heard the sound of Inseop taking off his clothes.\u00a0The sound of the hem of his clothes rubbing against his skin and falling off his feet made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath warm.\u201cAre you all naked?\u201d\u201cYe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon turned his head, Inseop, who was not wearing a single thing, stood there with his head bowed as if embarrassed.Lee Wooyeon, who looked at him as if possessed, held out his hand.\u201cCome here.\u201dInseop crouched and walked towards him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon held him in his arms and stood still for a while.\u00a0When he didn\u2019t do anything to him, Inseop got a little scared.\u00a0There were surgical scars around the chest, but he was worried that he might not like the body that had scars on the back as well.\u201cInseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice softly called out his name.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou said it was okay to have similar feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cLike a normal person, I like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI like you, Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I see Inseop, I want to hug you, I want to touch you, I want to have you by my side somehow, and if I don\u2019t see you, I think I\u2019ll go crazy.\u00a0So far, it\u2019s just normal feelings, but I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s not the end.\u201dInseop could barely guess what Lee Wooyeon\u2019s twisted feelings were.\u00a0It was the result of experiencing and realizing his dark abyss through a series of events.\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry for saying this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine.\u201dInseop said, giving strength to the arm that embraced Lee Wooyeon.\u201cEven if it\u2019s like that, I\u2019m fine so \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I wish you could tell me that you like me.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cMore.\u00a0Once more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dInseop burst into tears and buried his face in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s chest.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon kissed him.\u00a0Both bodies fell on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s legs and let out a hot breath.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock is so pretty.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2014-.\u201d\u201cFuck, don\u2019t show this cute cock to anyone but me.\u201dInseop\u2019s breathing became increasingly difficult because of the movement of the hand rubbing between his legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked several times if he was okay and kissed the nape of his neck.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it slow.\u201dIt was hard to resist because the bottom was hot, but Lee Wooyeon moved his body as slowly as possible so that Inseop did not overdo it.\u00a0Inseop, who was under Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body, started breathing more and more, and finally, with tears in his eyes, he grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u00a0Should I go slower?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u201cThen tell me what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Too\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s too slow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my head, \u2026 is muddled.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too slow\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my\u00a0body\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon said fuck and cursed and made Inseop sit up.\u00a0By making Inseop\u2019s legs spread apart, he pushed in his wet cock.\u00a0Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder and took a deep breath.\u00a0His genitals were half entered through the narrow hole.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon exhaled and held it in.\u201cThere\u2019s more to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWe still have half left.\u00a0Breathe in, so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed in the remaining at once.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body dropped and he let out a loud moan.\u201cGood job.\u00a0I\u2019m all in now, so I\u2019ll move in a little bit.\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0His stomach was tingling and his bottom was burning, so he just wanted him to do something, anything.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Now, if I move, Inseop will get hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026Me\u2026it\u2019s hot down there\u2026\u201dEven though he didn;t even touch him, Inseop\u2019s genitals slowly hardened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clenched his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll move then,\u201d and raised his waist slowly.\u00a0A quiet moan escaped Inseop\u2019s lips.Lee Wooyeon slid back and moved his waist forward.\u00a0The gaping hole made a squeaky gurgling sound and sucked in his flesh.\u00a0Cold sweat formed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead as he tried to suppress the seething desire.Choi Inseop, too, was suffering, panting for breath, as if he was about to fall, and the sensations below that seemed to sting.\u201cWooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please, \u2026Underneath, it\u2019s hot\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his teeth desperately.\u00a0His lips ripped open and blood flowed, and he tried his best to resist the urge.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Then, Inseop will move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work, so you can move as you please.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed Inseop\u2019s body up, and he lay down on the bed.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face turned even redder than before when he sat down on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thigh.\u201cI won\u2019t move, so you move.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmuteLee Wooyeon took his hand away from Inseop\u2019s body and said.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at him with tears in his eyes.\u201cMove your back.\u00a0Loosen up the hole a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0ugh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you tighten it too much, it hurts, yes, up and

waist.\u00a0Every time his buttocks touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thighs, his genitals touched his stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled Inseop\u2019s hand and made him touch his genitals.\u201cInseop, try touching it yourself.\u201dWhen he moved his hands entwined with his still-hot genitals, the front and back were stimulated, and Inseop went crazy.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0ah\u2026\u00a0\u201dWatching him shake his back and move his hands in a trance, Lee Wo-yeon bit his teeth.\u00a0Being unable to move even in front of a superb view was like a kind of torture to him.\u201cAhhh!\u00a0Wooyeon ah, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ah!\u201dThe contraction of the hole was faster than before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t take it any longer, so he got up, hugging Inseop.\u00a0He let out a groan, and pounded his waist between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Inseop, who reached his climax with a single shovel, stretched out on the bed, screaming, out of breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pounded his waist a few more times and ejaculated inside Inseop\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWith his eyes wide open, Lee Wooyeon, who exhaled at the peak of pleasure, gradually regained his reason.\u00a0When he found Inseop breathing hard under his body, he shouted in shock.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Shall we go to the hospital?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I \u2026I couldn\u2019t stand it until the end.\u201dIn the end, he thought it was like this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop, who was drenched in sweat and was out of breath, and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dInseop had less strength and embraced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body with his slightly trembling hands.\u00a0He wanted to do this.\u00a0At that time, he wanted to tell Lee Wooyeon, who came to him that night, while hugging him like this.\u201cI am fine.\u00a0I\u2019m stronger than you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to be so sorry about.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u00a0It\u2019s all my choice\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t hard, but that\u2019s okay.\u201dInseop poured out all the words he wanted to say that day.\u201cMy heart is strong.\u00a0Not that weak.\u00a0It\u2019s survived several surgeries, it\u2019s Jennie\u2019s last gift, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Above all, I endured Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0So I think it\u2019s fine.\u00a0So, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a heart that has been trained as a madman.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tone was filled with laughter.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and laughed along.\u00a0The two held each other other for a while.\u2018Sleep when you\u2019re sleepy.\u2019Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s hair and whispered.A heartbeat could be heard from the overlaid body.\u00a0When the two sounds sounded like one, Inseop could fall asleep in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms.In the dim light, a man opened an orange letterhead and read the letter.\u00a0Just like he always dreamed of.When Inseop opened his eyes, he reached out and stroked his arm, wondering if the man next to him was real and not a dreamer.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dA friendly voice was heard.\u00a0Inseop was relieved by the voice, closed his eyes and smiled.\u201cSleep more.\u00a0It\u2019s still night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0call home\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI did it before.\u00a0I told them it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you, so you\u2019ll be late.\u201dLee Wooyeon wrapped Inseop\u2019s hair on his fingertips, fiddling around with him, and telling him kind words.\u201cI read the letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe letter that Inseop gave me\u2026\u00a0To think that I have been there before and haven\u2019t read it makes me angry at the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0After all, I didn\u2019t write the content.\u201d\u201cStill, Inseop wrote it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to read it,\u201d he said in Inseop\u2019s ear, a voice that subsided with a sigh.\u00a0Closing his eyes and letting his mind wander, Inseop asked about Kate, as if in a sleep talk.\u201cWhere is she hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0She\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0I water once every three days.\u00a0In a well-ventilated place, and I don\u2019t bother.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, who memorized the words he had been asked to deliver, Inseop gave a small laugh.\u201cAfter seeing Inseop\u2019s letter, I wanted to make an excuse somehow.\u00a0So, I put Kate in my bag and bought a plane ticket to America.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dPlants were strictly prohibited items.\u00a0In some cases, if one was caught hiding something like that, they will be banned from entering the country.\u00a0Inseop was unable to speak properly at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s recklessness.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You didn\u2019t know I was this crazy, do you regret that we got involved for nothing?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0But even if you regret\u00a0\u2026 it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs if Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice sounded gloomy as he said that, Inseop reached out and placed his hand on his finger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop.\u00a0Inseop moved his fingers and put his finger between Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingers.And he gave strength to his fingers.\u201cMore\u2026\u00a0You can tie me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to keep living, tied up to you.\u201dIf Lee Wooyeon likes it.At the end, Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand as if he was talking to himself.\u00a0Knowing what the hand holding him tightly meant, Inseop put his head on his hand and closed his eyes.Rare, rare, sleep rushed in, and he feltLee Wooyeon\u2019s friendly touch.\u00a0A friendly voice coexisting in dream and reality put Inseop into a deep sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

82Translated by NaralaraEdited by NaralaraWhen the hotel door closed, Lee Wooyeon ran like a hungry person and kissed Inseop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t speak until Inseop, who was out of breath, gasped and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon put Inseop next to him and said.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I thought I was going to be like this, so I didn\u2019t want to see you for a while.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t have the confidence not to force Inseop to be next to him.\u00a0When he saw him, he wanted to touch him, and when he touched him, he got greedy, he wanted him, and he wanted to hold him in his arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dHe said as he straightened Inseop\u2019s disheveled collar.\u00a0Inseop asked why?\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0When your heart is strained, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I heard you needed to take it easy.\u201dAfter listening to the doctor\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon decided to send Inseop to the United States.\u00a0For the time being, he wanted to free Inseop from noisy problems, but above all, he was not confident that he would not touch him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you to the United States, but it\u2019s really not worth it.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and stroked Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0Inseop slowly closed his eyes once and opened them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I recently went to the doctor.\u00a0He\u2019s a doctor I\u2019ve been seeing since I was little\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHearing Inseop\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon kissed the top of his head.\u00a0Right now, he wanted to hug his body and go inside him, but he managed to hold on with reason.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Aren\u2019t you curious what I asked?\u201dInseop\u2019s face was flushed red.\u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d\u201cCa, can I do it\u2026\u00a0The doctor said if I don\u2019t overdo it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s clothes and kissed him roughly.\u00a0Inseop also tried his best to match his gestures and took off his clothes.\u00a0With his left hand, he didn\u2019t move as well as he thought, and Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue as if impatiently.\u201cI will\u2026\u00a0I will take it off.\u201dThinking that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s injured hand might be hurting, Inseop mustered up the courage and said.\u201cInseop, are you going to take it off?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCrossing the sea, good things happen.\u201dInseop was so shy that he didn\u2019t take off his clothes first.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon unbuttoned his shirt with one hand and looked at Inseop.\u00a0He was asking him to take it off.Inseop loosened the belt of his pants and unzipped his pants.\u00a0In the quiet room, there was an unusually loud sound of the zipper being lowered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon swallowed hard.\u00a0Inseop lowered his pants and took off his shoes.\u00a0When he took off his socks and put them next to his pants, he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s piercing gaze and his shoulders shook involuntarily.\u201cTake your top off as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOr will you take off your panties first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, could you please turn your head for a moment?\u201dIn a while, they were going to be all naked, biting and sucking, but Lee Wooyeon turned his head back as Inseop asked.\u201cIs it done?\u201d\u201cNot yet, wait a minute.\u201dHe heard the sound of Inseop taking off his clothes.\u00a0The sound of the hem of his clothes rubbing against his skin and falling off his feet made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath warm.\u201cAre you all naked?\u201d\u201cYe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon turned his head, Inseop, who was not wearing a single thing, stood there with his head bowed as if embarrassed.Lee Wooyeon, who looked at him as if possessed, held out his hand.\u201cCome here.\u201dInseop crouched and walked towards him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon held him in his arms and stood still for a while.\u00a0When he didn\u2019t do anything to him, Inseop got a little scared.\u00a0There were surgical scars around the chest, but he was worried that he might not like the body that had scars on the back as well.\u201cInseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice softly called out his name.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou said it was okay to have similar feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cLike a normal person, I like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI like you, Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I see Inseop, I want to hug you, I want to touch you, I want to have you by my side somehow, and if I don\u2019t see you, I think I\u2019ll go crazy.\u00a0So far, it\u2019s just normal feelings, but I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s not the end.\u201dInseop could barely guess what Lee Wooyeon\u2019s twisted feelings were.\u00a0It was the result of experiencing and realizing his dark abyss through a series of events.\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry for saying this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine.\u201dInseop said, giving strength to the arm that embraced Lee Wooyeon.\u201cEven if it\u2019s like that, I\u2019m fine so \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I wish you could tell me that you like me.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cMore.\u00a0Once more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dInseop burst into tears and buried his face in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s chest.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon kissed him.\u00a0Both bodies fell on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s legs and let out a hot breath.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock is so pretty.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2014-.\u201d\u201cFuck, don\u2019t show this cute cock to anyone but me.\u201dInseop\u2019s breathing became increasingly difficult because of the movement of the hand rubbing between his legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked several times if he was okay and kissed the nape of his neck.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it slow.\u201dIt was hard to resist because the bottom was hot, but Lee Wooyeon moved his body as slowly as possible so that Inseop did not overdo it.\u00a0Inseop, who was under Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body, started breathing more and more, and finally, with tears in his eyes, he grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u00a0Should I go slower?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u201cThen tell me what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Too\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s too slow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my head, \u2026 is muddled.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too slow\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my\u00a0body\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon said fuck and cursed and made Inseop sit up.\u00a0By making Inseop\u2019s legs spread apart, he pushed in his wet cock.\u00a0Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder and took a deep breath.\u00a0His genitals were half entered through the narrow hole.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon exhaled and held it in.\u201cThere\u2019s more to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWe still have half left.\u00a0Breathe in, so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed in the remaining at once.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body dropped and he let out a loud moan.\u201cGood job.\u00a0I\u2019m all in now, so I\u2019ll move in a little bit.\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0His stomach was tingling and his bottom was burning, so he just wanted him to do something, anything.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Now, if I move, Inseop will get hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026Me\u2026it\u2019s hot down there\u2026\u201dEven though he didn;t even touch him, Inseop\u2019s genitals slowly hardened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clenched his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll move then,\u201d and raised his waist slowly.\u00a0A quiet moan escaped Inseop\u2019s lips.Lee Wooyeon slid back and moved his waist forward.\u00a0The gaping hole made a squeaky gurgling sound and sucked in his flesh.\u00a0Cold sweat formed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead as he tried to suppress the seething desire.Choi Inseop, too, was suffering, panting for breath, as if he was about to fall, and the sensations below that seemed to sting.\u201cWooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please, \u2026Underneath, it\u2019s hot\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his teeth desperately.\u00a0His lips ripped open and blood flowed, and he tried his best to resist the urge.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Then, Inseop will move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work, so you can move as you please.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed Inseop\u2019s body up, and he lay down on the bed.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face turned even redder than before when he sat down on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thigh.\u201cI won\u2019t move, so you move.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmuteLee Wooyeon took his hand away from Inseop\u2019s body and said.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at him with tears in his eyes.\u201cMove your back.\u00a0Loosen up the hole a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0ugh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you tighten it too much, it hurts, yes, up and down, ha\u2026ha\u2026\u00a0you just need to move your hips on it.\u00a0With my dick in your ass, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ha.\u00a0Good job.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon instructed, Inseop moved his waist.\u00a0Every time his buttocks touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thighs, his genitals touched his stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled Inseop\u2019s hand and made him touch his genitals.\u201cInseop, try touching it yourself.\u201dWhen he moved his hands entwined with his still-hot genitals, the front and back were stimulated, and Inseop went crazy.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0ah\u2026\u00a0\u201dWatching him shake his back and move his hands in a trance, Lee Wo-yeon bit his teeth.\u00a0Being unable to move even in front of a superb view was like a kind of torture to him.\u201cAhhh!\u00a0Wooyeon ah, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ah!\u201dThe contraction of the hole was faster than before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t take it any longer, so he got up, hugging Inseop.\u00a0He let out a groan, and pounded his waist between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Inseop, who reached his climax with a single shovel, stretched out on the bed, screaming, out of breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pounded his waist a few more times and ejaculated inside Inseop\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWith his eyes wide open, Lee Wooyeon, who exhaled at the peak of pleasure, gradually regained his reason.\u00a0When he found Inseop breathing hard under his body, he shouted in shock.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Shall we go to the hospital?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I \u2026I couldn\u2019t stand it until the end.\u201dIn the end, he thought it was like this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop, who was drenched in sweat and was out of breath, and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dInseop had less strength and embraced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body with his slightly trembling hands.\u00a0He wanted to do this.\u00a0At that time, he wanted to tell Lee Wooyeon, who came to him that night, while hugging him like this.\u201cI am fine.\u00a0I\u2019m stronger than you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to be so sorry about.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u00a0It\u2019s all my choice\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t hard, but that\u2019s okay.\u201dInseop poured out all the words he wanted to say that day.\u201cMy heart is strong.\u00a0Not that weak.\u00a0It\u2019s survived several surgeries, it\u2019s Jennie\u2019s last gift, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Above all, I endured Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0So I think it\u2019s fine.\u00a0So, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a heart that has been trained as a madman.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tone was filled with laughter.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and laughed along.\u00a0The two held each other other for a while.\u2018Sleep when you\u2019re sleepy.\u2019Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s hair and whispered.A heartbeat could be heard from the overlaid body.\u00a0When the two sounds sounded like one, Inseop could fall asleep in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms.In the dim light, a man opened an orange letterhead and read the letter.\u00a0Just like he always dreamed of.When Inseop opened his eyes, he reached out and stroked his arm, wondering if the man next to him was real and not a dreamer.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dA friendly voice was heard.\u00a0Inseop was relieved by the voice, closed his eyes and smiled.\u201cSleep more.\u00a0It\u2019s still night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0call home\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI did it before.\u00a0I told them it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you, so you\u2019ll be late.\u201dLee Wooyeon wrapped Inseop\u2019s hair on his fingertips, fiddling around with him, and telling him kind words.\u201cI read the letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe letter that Inseop gave me\u2026\u00a0To think that I have been there before and haven\u2019t read it makes me angry at the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0After all, I didn\u2019t write the content.\u201d\u201cStill, Inseop wrote it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to read it,\u201d he said in Inseop\u2019s ear, a voice that subsided with a sigh.\u00a0Closing his eyes and letting his mind wander, Inseop asked about Kate, as if in a sleep talk.\u201cWhere is she hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0She\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0I water once every three days.\u00a0In a well-ventilated place, and I don\u2019t bother.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, who memorized the words he had been asked to deliver, Inseop gave a small laugh.\u201cAfter seeing Inseop\u2019s letter, I wanted to make an excuse somehow.\u00a0So, I put Kate in my bag and bought a plane ticket to America.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dPlants were strictly prohibited items.\u00a0In some cases, if one was caught hiding something like that, they will be banned from entering the country.\u00a0Inseop was unable to speak properly at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s recklessness.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You didn\u2019t know I was this crazy, do you regret that we got involved for nothing?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0But even if you regret\u00a0\u2026 it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs if Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice sounded gloomy as he said that, Inseop reached out and placed his hand on his finger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop.\u00a0Inseop moved his fingers and put his finger between Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingers.And he gave strength to his fingers.\u201cMore\u2026\u00a0You can tie me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to keep living, tied up to you.\u201dIf Lee Wooyeon likes it.At the end, Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand as if he was talking to himself.\u00a0Knowing what the hand holding him tightly meant, Inseop put his head on his hand and closed his eyes.Rare, rare, sleep rushed

Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay<Peter.\u00a0Can you run me some errands?><Yes.\u00a0Hold on.>As he went down the stairs, his mother handed him the money.<Go and buy some rice flour.\u00a0It must be organic.><Yes.\u00a0Anyway, I was just about to leave.><Are you going to the library?><I\u2019ll return books and do some stuff.><Go ahead.>Inseop\u2019s footsteps as he left the front door were light.\u00a0It has been about a month since he came to America, and his wounds have improved a lot and his complexion has brightened.\u00a0It was only natural for his blood color to return when he ate the healthy dishes that his mother made.Inseop was also exercising regularly.\u00a0He still had to go for a walk alone because he didn\u2019t have to work too hard, but he did exercise every day without skipping a day.\u00a0Will, who was in the yard, thought he was going for a walk and followed him and waved his tail.\u201cNo.\u00a0wait.\u00a0Today I will go alone.\u201dHe ruffled Will\u2019s fur with his hands and left the house.\u00a0Returning the borrowed book from the library, he bought flowers from the florist.\u00a0It was a flower to bring to Jennie.\u00a0He boarded the bus with the bunch of freesias she loved.Arriving at the cemetery, Inseop visited Jennie\u2019s grave and laid down the bouquet.<Happy Birthday,\u00a0Jennie.\u00a0You are still nineteen.>If they had still been together, they would have been able to share more fun and interesting stories.\u00a0If he could tell her what happened in Korea, how would she react?She wouldn\u2019t believe it and laugh.\u00a0Will her eyes brighten and beg him to tell her the next thing?<I know Philip is a bad guy, but\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t think he read your letter.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t the kind of person to read the letter in the first place.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0It must have been other people who did bad things to you.>It was a conclusion that Inseop came up with about the letter as he had been watching Lee Wooyeon, who had never touched a letter at all.<Sorry.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Jennie.\u00a0\u2019cause I didn\u2019t believe you\u00a0At that time, no matter what anyone said, I should have been on your side.>He wiped away the tears, muttering the remorse remaining in his heart.\u00a0After sitting on Jennie\u2019s grave for a while and talking about various things, he remembered that his mother had told him to buy rice flour and got up.<I\u2019ll come again next time.>Inseop said goodbye to Jennie and left the cemetery.\u00a0He got out of town and went to the\u00a0post office.He sent a letter to Lee Wooyeon yesterday and asked the post office worker how long it would take to arrive.\u00a0The employee returned the same answer as before, saying, \u201cSince it\u2019s a limited express, I think I\u2019ll be there in two days.\u201d\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Then it would have arrived.Five days ago, Inseop mustered up the courage to write a letter to Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Since arriving in the United States, they had not made any calls, texts, or mails.\u00a0Neither Lee Wooyeon, nor Choi Inseop.They did not contact each other as if they had promised.\u00a0Inseop was hesitant as to how many times he would pick up the phone and call him, but he barely endured it because he thought he would run to Korea right away after hearing his voice.It was an act close to a whim when he found a bunch of orange stationery he had bought before while cleaning out his bookshelf and decided to write a letter.After crumpling dozens of papers and throwing them in the trash, he managed to complete the letter.<Hello.\u00a0This is Choi Inseop.\u00a0I am doing well.\u00a0I wonder how you are doing.\u00a0I\u2019ll be back when summer vacation is over.ps-Is Kate doing well?>The last word added was added as a joke\u00a0Of course, he didn\u2019t know if the other side would take that as a joke.After sending the letter, Inseop looked into the mailbox several times a day.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t help but wait, even though he knew it wasn\u2019t the right time for a reply.\u00a0Even if there was no reply, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0If he calls him\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.Inseop shook his head.\u00a0No, no.In this situation, if Lee Wooyeon makes a phone call, he may fly to Korea and forget that he was on vacation because he was sick.\u00a0It was a decision he made deliberately with him in mind, and had to be patient and follow it.\u00a0Yes, he had to be patient.\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He felt like he forgot something.\u00a0Ah!\u00a0Rice flour.Inseop turned to the place where the Korean mart was.\u00a0His mother, whose hobby was baking, baked bread with rice flour.\u00a0Saying hello to the familiar old lady, he went into the store and picked up rice flour.\u201cHave you been on a trip?\u201dHaving been away from the United States for a year, people around him thought he was on a trip.\u00a0Inseop smiled and replied yes.\u201cWas it fun?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was fun, but \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t think I will ever forget it.\u201d\u201cThen, the hardships are because you are young.\u201dInseop\u2019s smile was drawn at the warm voice of the hostess, whom he had not heard in a long time.\u00a0After checkout, she turned around and turned up the volume of the TV as she said, oh, oh, oh.\u00a0Judging from the fact that she was speaking Korean, it seemed that it was her favorite Korean entertainment program.\u00a0It was an ironic fate that the name Lee Wooyeon came into Inseop\u2019s ears as he was about to leave the store.He turned and walked quickly to the counter where the television was installed.\u201cWhat did you say now?\u201d\u201cSome celebrity had a big accident.\u00a0The person who was filming that drama had an accident last time too.\u00a0What curse did that drama have?\u201d\u201cWho is the person who was in the accident?\u201d\u201cWhat was his name, Lee\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIs this Lee Wooyeon?\u201d\u201cYes, but why?\u201d\u201cWas he badly injured?\u00a0What are they saying?\u00a0How hurt is he?\u201dWhen Inseop asked in a voice that was on the verge of tears, the store owner widened her eyes and shrugged.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u00a0I just saw it on the show and they said that the car was half destroyed.\u00a0They\u2019ll never be able to shoot a drama aga\u2026in!!\u00a0Peter!\u201dInseop ran out of the store.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t run yet, but he was not in a position to walk.\u00a0He had to go home and pack his things right now.His parents won\u2019t allow him, but he\u2019ll explain later, because first of all, he had to pack up and go.\u00a0No, he doesn\u2019t even need luggage.\u00a0All he needed was his passport and money.He had to meet that person somehow.\u00a0Somehow.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ha\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t even run a single block, so he was out of breath.\u00a0His heartbeat increased and he bowed his back and panted for a while.\u00a0His legs were already heavy.\u00a0He had to go though.\u00a0Inseop took a deep breath, exhaled, straightened his back and started walking.When he crossed the corner and arrived in front of his house, he saw a black Benz parked.\u00a0He was wondering whose car it was, but now he didn\u2019t have time to worry about it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dInseop stopped walking, as if frozen in place.A man was standing in front of his house.\u00a0With a cast on his right shoulder, he stood in front of the front door with a stiff expression and was looking at his house.\u201c\u2026Lee Wooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cInseop.\u201dEven looking at it, he could not believe it, Inseop blinked his eyes several times.\u00a0It was Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon was now in America, standing in front of his house.\u201cUh, how do you\u2026no,\u00a0 there was an injury, there was an accident, where and how much\u2026\u00a0\u2026to the hospital\u2026\u00a0\u2026Are you okay?\u201dNot knowing what to ask first, he stuttered out all the words that came to his mind.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon made a troubled face for a moment, then opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Inseop\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Kate is not doing well.\u201dA flowerpot lay at his feet. It was fresh for not doing well. How the hell did he get on the plane with that? No, does that mean Kate came here sick? What the hell is it?Inseop looked at Lee Wooyeon with a face that he did not understand.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon sighed, then narrowed his eyes.\u201cI got a letter.\u201dHe pulled out the orange envelope from Inseop from his pocket.\u201cOriginally, I was going to have you stay in America for six months.\u201dInseop was also thinking that it would be okay to return to Korea around that time.\u00a0Of course, he missed Lee Wooyeon so much, but he felt sorry for his family, and it was because he decided that it was urgent to recover his health here.\u201cI didn\u2019t contact you on purpose.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t go to see your face even thou I wanted to see you, because I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to let you go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHe guessed it.\u00a0Through the notebook Lee Wooyeon sent, Inseop also noticed that he had given him a long vacation, and that he did not come to see him because he feared that he would not be able to send him back.\u201cBut then, that one letter\u2026\u00a0 drove me crazy.\u201dLee Wooyeon received Inseop\u2019s letter and read the same content hundreds or even thousands of times.\u00a0When he finally reached the point of masturbating while reading the letter, Lee Wooyeon changed his mind, thinking that he couldn\u2019t do it.Let\u2019s go see Choi Inseop.\u201cThe accident\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, Why\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it.\u201dLee Wooyeon laughed.He couldn\u2019t help it.\u00a0There were no drama plans, but the atmosphere was atrocious because of the accident that happened before, and he didn\u2019t think he could make the time without giving a plausible excuse. Lee Wooyeon just quietly drove out of his car.\u00a0The Mercedes-Benz that CEO Kim gave him was half destroyed. The doctor said that if something went wrong, his nerve could be cut and the arm could not be used forever.\u00a0And as a result, the drama was postponed indefinitely.\u00a0After Kang Youngmo and Lee Wooyeon had an accident, drama investors said they were unlucky from the start and decided to withdraw.\u00a0CEO Kim fell clutching the back of his neck, but Lee Wooyeon was able to confidently say that he would go and rest.Inseop took one step closer to him.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dSeeing the tears in his eyes filled with worries for him, Lee Wooyeon thought that he was lucky to have caused the accident.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0are the bones broken?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u00a0I will get well soon.\u201d\u201cDid you do this on purpose?\u201dLearn morePauseUnmute00:00Inseop\u2019s voice was filled with resentment.\u00a0When Lee Wooyeon smiled vaguely and did not answer, Inseop raised his voice.\u201cWhy are you like that?\u00a0Why!\u00a0I can see you after a while anyway\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0If you get hurt like this\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon embraced Inseop with one arm.\u201cFuckt, I\u2019m going crazy because I miss you, what do you want me to do?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to die, but I only read and read your letter all day, I keep thinking about you, I want to touch you\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I came here because I thought I was going crazy.\u00a0Can\u2019t I do that?\u201dLee Wooyeon asked again.\u201cIs that not possible?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cDid Inseop not want to see me?\u201dInseop nodded slightly in his arms.\u00a0He said \u201cI miss you,\u201d swallowing the lump in his throat.\u00a0After taking a deep breath, Lee Wooyeon opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I want to kiss Inseop, but I\u2019m having a bit of trouble here.\u00a0First, let\u2019s go to the hotel.\u201dInseop wiped away his tears.\u201cHold on a second, please.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dEven on the plane from Korea to the United States, Lee Wooyeon could not sleep at the thought of seeing Inseop.\u00a0He rented a car from the airport and came here, almost ignoring the signal.\u00a0The word \u201cHold on a second\u201d that came out of Inseop\u2019s mouth now sounded crueler to him than to wait for the rest of his life.Inseop went to the front door and put down the package he was holding.\u00a0Then he came back to Lee Wooyeon and said,\u201cLet\u2019s go now\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

82Translated by NaralaraEdited by NaralaraWhen the hotel door closed, Lee Wooyeon ran like a hungry person and kissed Inseop.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon didn\u2019t speak until Inseop, who was out of breath, gasped and hung on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, sorry.\u201dLee Wooyeon put Inseop next to him and said.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I thought I was going to be like this, so I didn\u2019t want to see you for a while.\u201dLee Wooyeon didn\u2019t have the confidence not to force Inseop to be next to him.\u00a0When he saw him, he wanted to touch him, and when he touched him, he got greedy, he wanted him, and he wanted to hold him in his arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dHe said as he straightened Inseop\u2019s disheveled collar.\u00a0Inseop asked why?\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0When your heart is strained, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I heard you needed to take it easy.\u201dAfter listening to the doctor\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon decided to send Inseop to the United States.\u00a0For the time being, he wanted to free Inseop from noisy problems, but above all, he was not confident that he would not touch him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you to the United States, but it\u2019s really not worth it.\u201dLee Wooyeon smiled and stroked Inseop\u2019s hair.\u00a0Inseop slowly closed his eyes once and opened them.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I recently went to the doctor.\u00a0He\u2019s a doctor I\u2019ve been seeing since I was little\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dHearing Inseop\u2019s words, Lee Wooyeon kissed the top of his head.\u00a0Right now, he wanted to hug his body and go inside him, but he managed to hold on with reason.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Aren\u2019t you curious what I asked?\u201dInseop\u2019s face was flushed red.\u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d\u201cCa, can I do it\u2026\u00a0The doctor said if I don\u2019t overdo it\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dLee Wooyeon took off Inseop\u2019s clothes and kissed him roughly.\u00a0Inseop also tried his best to match his gestures and took off his clothes.\u00a0With his left hand, he didn\u2019t move as well as he thought, and Lee Wooyeon clicked his tongue as if impatiently.\u201cI will\u2026\u00a0I will take it off.\u201dThinking that Lee Wooyeon\u2019s injured hand might be hurting, Inseop mustered up the courage and said.\u201cInseop, are you going to take it off?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCrossing the sea, good things happen.\u201dInseop was so shy that he didn\u2019t take off his clothes first.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon unbuttoned his shirt with one hand and looked at Inseop.\u00a0He was asking him to take it off.Inseop loosened the belt of his pants and unzipped his pants.\u00a0In the quiet room, there was an unusually loud sound of the zipper being lowered.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon swallowed hard.\u00a0Inseop lowered his pants and took off his shoes.\u00a0When he took off his socks and put them next to his pants, he felt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s piercing gaze and his shoulders shook involuntarily.\u201cTake your top off as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cOr will you take off your panties first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, could you please turn your head for a moment?\u201dIn a while, they were going to be all naked, biting and sucking, but Lee Wooyeon turned his head back as Inseop asked.\u201cIs it done?\u201d\u201cNot yet, wait a minute.\u201dHe heard the sound of Inseop taking off his clothes.\u00a0The sound of the hem of his clothes rubbing against his skin and falling off his feet made Lee Wooyeon\u2019s breath warm.\u201cAre you all naked?\u201d\u201cYe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201dWhen Lee Wooyeon turned his head, Inseop, who was not wearing a single thing, stood there with his head bowed as if embarrassed.Lee Wooyeon, who looked at him as if possessed, held out his hand.\u201cCome here.\u201dInseop crouched and walked towards him.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon held him in his arms and stood still for a while.\u00a0When he didn\u2019t do anything to him, Inseop got a little scared.\u00a0There were surgical scars around the chest, but he was worried that he might not like the body that had scars on the back as well.\u201cInseop.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s voice softly called out his name.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou said it was okay to have similar feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yes.\u201d\u201cLike a normal person, I like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201d\u201cI like you, Inseop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I see Inseop, I want to hug you, I want to touch you, I want to have you by my side somehow, and if I don\u2019t see you, I think I\u2019ll go crazy.\u00a0So far, it\u2019s just normal feelings, but I\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s not the end.\u201dInseop could barely guess what Lee Wooyeon\u2019s twisted feelings were.\u00a0It was the result of experiencing and realizing his dark abyss through a series of events.\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry for saying this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s fine.\u201dInseop said, giving strength to the arm that embraced Lee Wooyeon.\u201cEven if it\u2019s like that, I\u2019m fine so \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I wish you could tell me that you like me.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cMore.\u00a0Once more\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI like you.\u00a0Inseop.\u201dInseop burst into tears and buried his face in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s chest.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon kissed him.\u00a0Both bodies fell on the bed.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon rubbed Inseop\u2019s legs and let out a hot breath.\u201cInseop\u2019s cock is so pretty.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2014-.\u201d\u201cFuck, don\u2019t show this cute cock to anyone but me.\u201dInseop\u2019s breathing became increasingly difficult because of the movement of the hand rubbing between his legs.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon asked several times if he was okay and kissed the nape of his neck.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it slow.\u201dIt was hard to resist because the bottom was hot, but Lee Wooyeon moved his body as slowly as possible so that Inseop did not overdo it.\u00a0Inseop, who was under Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body, started breathing more and more, and finally, with tears in his eyes, he grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arm.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u00a0Should I go slower?\u201dInseop shook his head.\u201cThen tell me what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0Too\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s too slow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my head, \u2026 is muddled.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too slow\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my\u00a0body\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon said fuck and cursed and made Inseop sit up.\u00a0By making Inseop\u2019s legs spread apart, he pushed in his wet cock.\u00a0Inseop grabbed Lee Wooyeon\u2019s shoulder and took a deep breath.\u00a0His genitals were half entered through the narrow hole.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon exhaled and held it in.\u201cThere\u2019s more to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ugh\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cWe still have half left.\u00a0Breathe in, so\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201dLee Wooyeon pushed in the remaining at once.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s body dropped and he let out a loud moan.\u201cGood job.\u00a0I\u2019m all in now, so I\u2019ll move in a little bit.\u201dInseop shook his head.\u00a0His stomach was tingling and his bottom was burning, so he just wanted him to do something, anything.\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Now, if I move, Inseop will get hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u00a0\u2026Me\u2026it\u2019s hot down there\u2026\u201dEven though he didn;t even touch him, Inseop\u2019s genitals slowly hardened.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon clenched his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll move then,\u201d and raised his waist slowly.\u00a0A quiet moan escaped Inseop\u2019s lips.Lee Wooyeon slid back and moved his waist forward.\u00a0The gaping hole made a squeaky gurgling sound and sucked in his flesh.\u00a0Cold sweat formed on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s forehead as he tried to suppress the seething desire.Choi Inseop, too, was suffering, panting for breath, as if he was about to fall, and the sensations below that seemed to sting.\u201cWooyeon\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, please, \u2026Underneath, it\u2019s hot\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dLee Wooyeon clenched his teeth desperately.\u00a0His lips ripped open and blood flowed, and he tried his best to resist the urge.\u201cInseop.\u00a0Then, Inseop will move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work, so you can move as you please.\u201dLee Wooyeon placed Inseop\u2019s body up, and he lay down on the bed.\u00a0Inseop\u2019s face turned even redder than before when he sat down on Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thigh.\u201cI won\u2019t move, so you move.\u201dLearn morePauseUnmuteLee Wooyeon took his hand away from Inseop\u2019s body and said.\u00a0Choi Inseop looked at him with tears in his eyes.\u201cMove your back.\u00a0Loosen up the hole a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0ugh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cIf you tighten it too much, it hurts, yes, up and down, ha\u2026ha\u2026\u00a0you just need to move your hips on it.\u00a0With my dick in your ass, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ha.\u00a0Good job.\u201dAs Lee Wooyeon instructed, Inseop moved his waist.\u00a0Every time his buttocks touched Lee Wooyeon\u2019s thighs, his genitals touched his stomach.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pulled Inseop\u2019s hand and made him touch his genitals.\u201cInseop, try touching it yourself.\u201dWhen he moved his hands entwined with his still-hot genitals, the front and back were stimulated, and Inseop went crazy.\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0ah\u2026\u00a0\u201dWatching him shake his back and move his hands in a trance, Lee Wo-yeon bit his teeth.\u00a0Being unable to move even in front of a superb view was like a kind of torture to him.\u201cAhhh!\u00a0Wooyeon ah, I\u2026\u00a0\u2026 ah!\u201dThe contraction of the hole was faster than before.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon couldn\u2019t take it any longer, so he got up, hugging Inseop.\u00a0He let out a groan, and pounded his waist between Inseop\u2019s legs.\u00a0Inseop, who reached his climax with a single shovel, stretched out on the bed, screaming, out of breath.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon pounded his waist a few more times and ejaculated inside Inseop\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026!\u00a0\u2026!\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!\u201dWith his eyes wide open, Lee Wooyeon, who exhaled at the peak of pleasure, gradually regained his reason.\u00a0When he found Inseop breathing hard under his body, he shouted in shock.\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0Inseop.\u00a0Shall we go to the hospital?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u00a0I \u2026I couldn\u2019t stand it until the end.\u201dIn the end, he thought it was like this.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon hugged Inseop, who was drenched in sweat and was out of breath, and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dInseop had less strength and embraced Lee Wooyeon\u2019s body with his slightly trembling hands.\u00a0He wanted to do this.\u00a0At that time, he wanted to tell Lee Wooyeon, who came to him that night, while hugging him like this.\u201cI am fine.\u00a0I\u2019m stronger than you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to be so sorry about.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.\u00a0It\u2019s all my choice\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t hard, but that\u2019s okay.\u201dInseop poured out all the words he wanted to say that day.\u201cMy heart is strong.\u00a0Not that weak.\u00a0It\u2019s survived several surgeries, it\u2019s Jennie\u2019s last gift, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Above all, I endured Lee Wooyeon.\u00a0So I think it\u2019s fine.\u00a0So, \u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a heart that has been trained as a madman.\u201dLee Wooyeon\u2019s tone was filled with laughter.\u00a0Inseop said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and laughed along.\u00a0The two held each other other for a while.\u2018Sleep when you\u2019re sleepy.\u2019Lee Wooyeon patted Inseop\u2019s hair and whispered.A heartbeat could be heard from the overlaid body.\u00a0When the two sounds sounded like one, Inseop could fall asleep in Lee Wooyeon\u2019s arms.In the dim light, a man opened an orange letterhead and read the letter.\u00a0Just like he always dreamed of.When Inseop opened his eyes, he reached out and stroked his arm, wondering if the man next to him was real and not a dreamer.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dA friendly voice was heard.\u00a0Inseop was relieved by the voice, closed his eyes and smiled.\u201cSleep more.\u00a0It\u2019s still night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0call home\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI did it before.\u00a0I told them it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you, so you\u2019ll be late.\u201dLee Wooyeon wrapped Inseop\u2019s hair on his fingertips, fiddling around with him, and telling him kind words.\u201cI read the letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cThe letter that Inseop gave me\u2026\u00a0To think that I have been there before and haven\u2019t read it makes me angry at the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0After all, I didn\u2019t write the content.\u201d\u201cStill, Inseop wrote it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to read it,\u201d he said in Inseop\u2019s ear, a voice that subsided with a sigh.\u00a0Closing his eyes and letting his mind wander, Inseop asked about Kate, as if in a sleep talk.\u201cWhere is she hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0She\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0I water once every three days.\u00a0In a well-ventilated place, and I don\u2019t bother.\u201dAt Lee Wooyeon\u2019s words, who memorized the words he had been asked to deliver, Inseop gave a small laugh.\u201cAfter seeing Inseop\u2019s letter, I wanted to make an excuse somehow.\u00a0So, I put Kate in my bag and bought a plane ticket to America.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dPlants were strictly prohibited items.\u00a0In some cases, if one was caught hiding something like that, they will be banned from entering the country.\u00a0Inseop was unable to speak properly at Lee Wooyeon\u2019s recklessness.\u201cWhy?\u00a0You didn\u2019t know I was this crazy, do you regret that we got involved for nothing?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0But even if you regret\u00a0\u2026 it\u2019s too late.\u201dAs if Lee Wooyeon\u2019s voice sounded gloomy as he said that, Inseop reached out and placed his hand on his finger.\u00a0Lee Wooyeon looked down at Inseop.\u00a0Inseop moved his fingers and put his finger between Lee Wooyeon\u2019s fingers.And he gave strength to his fingers.\u201cMore\u2026\u00a0You can tie me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\u201cI want to keep living, tied up to you.\u201dIf Lee Wooyeon likes it.At the end, Lee Wooyeon gave strength to his hand as if he was talking to himself.\u00a0Knowing what the hand holding him tightly meant, Inseop put his head on his hand and closed his eyes.Rare, rare, sleep rushed in, and he feltLee Wooyeon\u2019s friendly touch.\u00a0A friendly voice coexisting in dream and reality put Inseop into a deep sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
