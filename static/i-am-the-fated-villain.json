    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: The Young Master, Gu Changge\u201cIs this what the so called Taixuan Holy Land, one of the six great holy lands of the Eastern Wilds, is really like? Bullying the weak, sucking up to the strong, forcibly pushing one\u2019s own daughter into hell?\u201d\u201cFrom start to end, have you ever even bothered asking whether the Holy Maiden of Taixuan herself whether she was willing? Today, I\u2019ll be the one to stand up for her.\u201d\u201cAs for the position as a disciple of the Taixuan Holy Land, I\u2019m fine throwing it away this day.\u201d\u201cHowever, I\u2019ll have the Taixuan Holy Land remember this. I, Ye Chen, will pay back the shame of this day manyfold in the future.\u201dWithin the brilliantly decorated main hall, it was quite rowdy and filled with people.At this moment, a handsome and determined looking youth was clenching his hands and roaring out his defiance.His name was Ye Chen. He was an inner disciple.\u201cPresumptuous! For a mere inner disciple to dare to challenge the Holy Master. Do you tire of life?\u201dOff to the side, an inner elder shouted at the youth with a terrifying aura. His face was turning purple in an ugly expression.This was the main hall of the Taixuan Holy Land, one of the six great holy lands of the Eastern Wilds. How could they allow a mere inner disciple act out here?Plus, today was the day for the ceremony where they inaugurate the Holy Child. They even had invited a number of major powers to observe.Now though, all of them were watching this debacle.If not for the matter of face, he would already have slain this insensible inner disciple with a single palm.Within the main hall, a horde of inner and true disciples pointed and chatted.They looked at the determined youth like he was an idiot.\u201cIs that Ye Chen insane? He\u2019s actually saying such things right in the middle of the main hall like that?\u201d\u201cAlthough his abilities are fairly good among the inner disciples, and there were even rumors that a certain elder wanted to accept him as a true disciple. But, from the looks of things, there\u2019s probably no way anymore.\u201dOne individual couldn\u2019t hold back their sneer.\u201cIn my opinion, he\u2019s seriously just tired of living. If he ends up angering that young master, our entire Taixuan Holy land might end up paying for it.\u201dThe true disciple next to him was somewhat angry and worried.If that mysterious young master ended up becoming unhappy because of the incident that Ye Chen just stirred up, it might not end with just the Taixuan Holy Land paying for it.Instead, it might be the whole of the Eastern Wilds that ends up paying for it.That what why he almost wanted to personally kill Ye Chen on the spot.Some of the disciples of the elders of various major powers that came to observe the ceremony, at this time, was watching the whole thing unfold like it as an interesting drama.Of course, many of them just looked at this inner disciple named Ye Chen like he was a monkey.For a mere inner disciple, he could have done anything else.Yet, he just had to act out against the current Holy Master of Taixuan.\u201cYou\u2019re called Ye Chen, right? I remember you. You came from a remote place in Tianqing City. After experiencing countless trials, you finally managed to enter my Taixuan Holy Land\u2026\u201d\u201cNow though, you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re throwing away your position in the Taixuan Holy Land?\u201dAt this point, a middle aged man at the head of the main hall started speaking.His gaze swept through the room like a golden flash of light. His aura was deep as the depths of the oceans. The divine light flowing from his form released a terrifying majesty without even doing anything.Obviously, he was someone super powerful.That was the current Holy Master of the Taixuan Holy Land.The moment he spoke up, the entire hall quieted down.Even the various guests who came to observe the ceremony had stopped talking.Buzz!Ye Chen felt a powerful pressure, and sweat started pouring down his forehead.However, he can\u2019t possibly back down at this moment.After all, he had a trump of his own.\u201cHoly Master. I merely wanted to seek justice for the Holy Maiden, that\u2019s all. After all, I can\u2019t just watch and do nothing as she falls into hell\u2026\u201dYe Chen\u2019s words were forceful and full of justness.As he spoke, his gaze involuntarily shifted to a girl up at the front.That girl was very beautiful. Her features delicate and well formed.Her eyes were like the streams in autumn, her brows beautiful as the mountains.Her dark hair perfectly framed her face, which was pale and smooth, glistening with a light that captures the heart.Her white dress flowed about her, giving her an otherworldly impression. Her aura was peaceful and calm to the point where it was hard to describe with words.Her was like a divine maiden of the heavens that had accidentally fallen to the world below.Even with all that had happened in the main hall, her expression remained peaceful from beginning to end.\u201cFalls into hell? You dare\u2026\u201dWhen he heard those words, the Holy Master of Taixuan\u2019s face fell with some anger.At that moment, many people had understood. Their face made strange expressions with a hint of mockery.After all that this Ye Chen had said, wasn\u2019t it all just because he was mad that the Holy Master gave the Maiden that he was smitten with for so long to another man?They weren\u2019t idiots.After all\u2026 That young master was someone that even the Holy Master had to act so respectful and toward.At this point, many people all looked toward the young man sitting at the front, sipping tea like he hadn\u2019t paid any attention to all that had been going on.Gu Changge!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: Transmigration Into Fantasy, The Fated VillainGu Change\u2019s eyes gazed lazily at the cup of tea in his hand.His clothes white as snow, untouched by so much as a speck of dust.His handsome and unblemished face was calm, as if covered by a layer of mist.However, if one looked deeper, one would discover an indifference that cared for nothing.High above, gazing down upon all.His mind, unknowable.Throughout everything that had happened within the main hall, he didn\u2019t seem to have the slightest care.One who is situated beyond.Well, that\u2019s the feeling that everyone else had.Anyone could feel that this man in white was of an uncommon status.Be it his aura or actions, they all carried with it a feel of one beyond this world.He was no mere mortal!Of course, no one knew that this indifferent expression of Gu Changge was in fact him being\u2026 Completely at a loss.It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t care about what was happening in the main hall.Rather, he as just blanking out due to his memories merging.He was a transmigrator.A second ago, he was still sleeping, but the moment he woke up, he was already in this super dangerous fantasy world.Here, the mighty could puck the very stars and moon, move mountains and seas, fly across the heaven and earth. The weak however were simply stepped on, their lives worth little more than weeds, with no respect to speak of.He was a true disciple of the Immortal Church from the Upper Realm, who came down to train himself.His talents were prodigious. His background terrifying.However, based on Gu Changge\u2019s experience from reading countless web novels in his previous life, no matter how one looks at it, his current self is definitely some kind of mob villain. Or rather, one of those cannon fodders who could barely live past a couple of chapters.Gu Changge was rather pained by this result.Taking another look at the scene before him. Bah, the moment he transmigrated, he ended up stuck in a situation where he gets humiliated by a Child of Fortune.The name Ye Chen was obviously the name of a protagonist.As for his own name of Gu Changge, it was obviously the name of some cannon fodder villain written in just to allow the protagonist to show off.He himself had already been shown as amazing, so wouldn\u2019t it be even better if the protagonist showed him up?\u201cGu Changge\u2026\u201d\u201cGu Changge\u2026\u201dBy then, Ye Chen had already repeatedly shouted Gu Changge\u2019s name several times without any response.Gu Chengge hasn\u2019t even bothered looking in Ye Chen\u2019s direction.That complete dismissal, that attitude of looking down on him made Ye Chen erupt with anger. His fists clenched tight enough to let out sounds of crackling.\u201cImpudence! Is the young master\u2019s name something that you\u2019re allowed to yell unrestrained?\u201dAt that moment a loud shout came from the side. It bore with it coldness and rage, as well as a certain pressure.The one who spoke was the newly inaugurated Holy Child of the Taixuan Holy Land.His expressions were cold. As he walked forward, runes flashed in his balm with mystic might, as if ready to act and properly leach Ye Chen a lesson.This was the moment for him to show off.If not for the fact that he got a minor word of praise from Gu Changge.He wouldn\u2019t have been able to so easily exceeded all the other true disciples to become the new Taixuan Holy Child.Thus, he was unbelievable grateful to Gu Changge.After all, he wasn\u2019t like Su Qingge, who has the Holy Master as her father and was set as the Holy Maiden from the moment she was born.\u201cImpudence! Ye Chen. Today, you have challenged the sect over and over before all our guests. I truly wonder at your sense of loyalty\u2026\u201d\u201cGuards! Arrest him and throw him into the dungeons to await judgment.\u201dAt this moment, an elder also stood up to loudly scold him.He won\u2019t let go of such a nice chance to gain Gu Changge\u2019s favor.\u201cYeah! Holy Master, how about taking this opportunity to purge Ye Chen of his cultivation and expel him from the sect!\u201d\u201cIt would also be a way of apologizing to young master Gu.\u201dThe rest of the elders reacted and also stood up to add their own words to the mix, loudly scolding Ye Chen for his disrespect and rudeness.All the guests from the major factions who came were rather shocked.Just what is the identity of this mysterious man in white?Ye Chen\u2019s face also paled.He realized that the situation was turning against him.Everyone was trying to suck up to Gu Changge.And even Su Qingge was staying silent.Why?This was completely different from how he thought it would turn out.At that moment, a cool burst of will entered him from one of his fingers.Ye Chen\u2019s somewhat irritated mental state soon calmed down quite a bit.Gu Changge simply sat at the head of the hall, took a sip of tea, and a spark of interest shone in his eyes.Oh? He didn\u2019t even say anything yet, and this Child of Fortune named Ye Chen had already gotten in such a state?That was a bit unsuited for his status as a Child of Fortune.Then Gu Changge\u2019s gaze shifted and fell upon the ring on Ye Chen\u2019s hand.Hmmm.It\u2019s the standard old master trope from a few years ago. As expected of a Child of Fortune. Can\u2019t get away from that after all.\u201cGu Changge, what else can you do besides bullying others using your authority?\u201dYe Chen once again opened his mouth and glared at Gu Changge with unmatched rage.It was as if this whole situation as something that Gu Changge specifically set up to deal with him.If not for him, then how could Su Qingge been given away by the Holy Master?As he thought that, Ye Chen felt as if packet of pure rage dwelled within his heart. He wanted to tear Gu Changge into a million pieces right there and then.Who knows what could happen over a night.He had once faced a great tribulation alongside Su Qingge.However, all that time, he had always maintained an attitude where he simply looked at her from afar.He hasn\u2019t even so much as touched her dress!Gu Changge simply continued to calmly gaze into his cup of tea. His expression didn\u2019t change. None could tell what he was feeling.However, he in fact had found it rather funny.The fuck does it have to do with me.Based on his original\u2019s memories, before this moment, he didn\u2019t even know that a little guy like Ye Chen existed.As for the Holy Master of Taixuan personally giving his daughter to him.That wasn\u2019t because he wanted her.Strike while the iron is hot and use this opportunity to earn his favor.Isn\u2019t that normal in pretty much any world?Never mind a fantasy dog eat dog world.His background is terrifying after all.This Ye Chen doesn\u2019t have any real abilities, but his skills at setting blame was pretty amazing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Showing Off, I Can Do It Too\u201cYoung master Gu, I beg your forgiveness for this disciple Ye Chen\u2019s lack of manners.\u201dThe Holy Master of Taixuan\u2019s face fell.As he apologized to Gu Chengge, he signaled to several elders using his eyes.All the guests were watching the drama unfold.Has his Taixuan Holy Land ever suffered such a humiliation?\u201cHoly Master, allow me to arrest Ye Chen here and now as an apology to young master Gu.\u201dAt this moment, the Holy Child Chu Xuan took initiative in trying to gain Gu Chengge\u2019s favor.He was already moving as he spoke. Runes flashed and appeared in his palm as it launched toward Ye Chen in a probing attack.Booom!Deep and thunderous sounds blasted out in that space.Runes merged and transformed into a terrible flash of lightning as if it was a dragon of lightning.As the Holy Child of Taixuan, his abilities were naturally one of the best among his peers.Ye Chen was merely an inner disciple.There was a major disparity between their realmsThus, how could he possibly be a match for Chu Xuan.Within the hall, spectral lights appeared. Runes, flashed.Everyone was watching this battle.Most people, including the Taixuan Holy Master, didn\u2019t particularly pay attention to the results.They were just waiting for Ye Chen\u2019s defeat.After all, if they personally acted, it would be their reputations that were damaged.There were many spies of the other Holy Lands and major clans among the guests who come to observe the ceremony.He personally didn\u2019t want to compound his humiliation.\u201cCome on then.\u201dYe Chen on the other hand faced this battle excitedly.He showed no fear. Instead, he called up all his power and faced the attack head on with a palm strike.\u201cThat Ye Chen really doesn\u2019t know his own place. He didn\u2019t even consider his actual abilities, and is just trying to commit suicide here.\u201dSome inner disciples sneered with derision.\u201cHoly Child Chu Xuan is a half step to the Transcendent realm. Ye Chen is merely at the Soul Palace realm. This isn\u2019t even going into the fact that the Holy Child bears the Thunder Prison Divine Body\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no chance of unexpected happenings in this fight.\u201dThe rest of the disciples were chattering. All of them believed that Ye Chen was merely committing suicide.In the next moment, flames shines. Lightning flashed.In an explosive clash, heat met brilliant light.Chu Xuan\u2019s body shook. His mighty body was actually slightly numb.Ye Chen however acted like a young god of fire. He stood unmoved with a confident expression.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cFor him to be that strong\u2026\u201dCountless young female disciples started showing some interest.Ye Chen\u2019s strength rather exceeded their expectations.A lot of people were shocked.In that exchange, both side equaled each other in force.\u201cYe Chen is obviously only at the Soul Palace realm in cultivation, but he actually blocked the Holy Child who is at the Transcendent realm?\u201dAll the disciples and elders were quite shocked at this.Even the Taixuan Holy Master, who had been watching with a sullen expression, was slightly shaken inside.After all, Chu Xuan bore a type of Thunder Prison Divine Body. He himself was able to hit above his realm level.He had few opponents within his own generation.And yet, he actually failed to finish things in a single move against Ye Chen, who was a whole realm below him?Could Ye Chen\u2019s own potential be stronger than even Chu Xuan\u2019s? And no one discovered this until now?Of course, if you were to ask if someone wasn\u2019t surprised by this turn of events.That would be Gu Changge.That\u2019s a Child of Fortune after all.Overturning everyone\u2019s expectations is basically what they did.He sedately took another sip of his tea.He spoke without any deliberate hurry or slowness.\u201cYou seem to have quite the trust in his Ye Chen all this time, hmm?\u201dSu Qingge turned at the statement.Her originally calm gaze suddenly wavered slightly.A gentle scent wafted over. It seemed like some kind of perfume.She didn\u2019t speak.However, her actions had already betrayed her thoughts.Gu Changge gave her a deep look and smiled, \u201cFor you to put so much effort into acting like you\u2019re calm, are you trying to make me thing that you really don\u2019t have anything going on with Ye Chen? Afraid that I might deal with him?\u201d\u201cWhat a cunning woman you are.\u201dHe easily revealed what she was trying to hide.For some reason, Su Qingge felt that the man before her was very scary. His current actions made her more nervous than back when he was acting uninterested.However, she pursed her lips and continued to keep silent.Gu Changge looked down at his cup of tea and spoke in a calm tone, \u201cIt\u2019s empty\u2026\u201dSu Qingge gave him a look before silently picking up the tea pot and refilling his cup.\u201cInteresting.\u201dGu Changge\u2019s smile was quite mysterious. It was like he was saying that to himself, but it also seemed like he was saying it to Su Qingge.The hand that Su Qingge used to hold the tea pot shook slightly.When it comes to such well tread cliches, Gu Changge could pull out a few hundred examples off the top of his head.Ye Chen acted so rashly today.It was simply because he heard that the Taixuan Holy Master was delivered his own daughter to Gu Chengge\u2019s palace the previous night.However, his previous personally was indifferent. In his eyes, training was the only thing that mattered.Thus, he didn\u2019t so much as touch Su Qingge.However, based on the interactions thus far, it was obvious that Su Qingge is a so called heroine.After all, going from the plot, Ye Chen had risen up from an unimportant place, and after countless battles, he finally managed to enter the Taixuan Holy Land as a disciple.It should actually be about the midpoint of his story.Su Qingge had strong potential, perfect beauty, was the Holy Maiden of the Taixuan Holy Land, and was very smart.She knew that if Ye Chen were to face off against himself, it would be akin to trying to smash a rock with an egg.Therefore, she won\u2019t try to ask for lenience for Ye Chen.All that would do is make himself dislike Ye Chen even more.The best way then is to purge all relationship with Ye Chen. To make him believe that there was nothing between her and Ye Chen.With a setting like that, what else could she be but a heroine?Unfortunately for her, Gu Chengge had long since easily seen through all of that.It was like he saw things from the god\u2019s eye view.Especially since now, Gu Chengge knew that he had been set as the villain, so he had no plans of letting Su Qingge off.A melon, forcibly taken, might not be sweet.But it does still quenches one\u2019s thirst.\u201cI\u2019ve underestimated you.\u201dDown below, the Taixuan Holy Child Chu Xuan had a terrible expression on his face. He spoke coldly and planned to continue.For him to have failed to take down Ye Chen before everyone, especially Gu Changge. He felt it was quite shameful of him.However, at this time, Gu Changge had already come down and waved his hand.\u201cHow boring.\u201dHowever, that initial statement made Ye Chen freeze up like he was dumbfounded.\u201cHowever, since this whole thing begun with me, I won\u2019t be troubling the Holy Child Chu Quan anymore.\u201d\u201cThat fearlessness. Is it due to ignorance?\u201dGu Changge spoke indifferently.Then, as his gaze fell.The next moment, a terrifying pressure descended as if the world itself was breaking.A terrible tempest swept through the main hall. Runes flashed. Spirit energy vibrated.Everyone felt a deep terror in their very souls.Even many elders openly showed their shock and fear.\u201cSo this is young master Gu\u2019s true power huh\u2026\u201d The Taixuan Holy Master turned serious.And with a bang!The person who started all this, Ye Chen, suddenly visibly shifted in expression. His face was a stark white.Then, his legs collapsed from under him, and his entire personage dropped to the ground.His head met the ground, unable to move an inch.He had been completely crushed.No matter how much he calls out to his master within his ring, it was of no use.\u201cHow could his true power be so strong\u2026\u201dYe Chen raised his head with all his strength and looked up at the man in white, looking down as if gazing at mere ants, with disbelief and unwillingness to accept this result.Wasn\u2019t it just showing off?I can do it too.Gu Changge gave an appearance of being uncaring and above it all, but in actuality, he was sneering in his mind.There wasn\u2019t any need to think more of it. The original result of this battle should be that Ye Chen would defeat Chu Quan from a position of weakness.He would overturn everyone\u2019s thoughts.Then, Ye Chen would use that opening to challenge himself to a fight.Then maybe make some kind of wager right? Using the old master in his ring, that could be easily accomplished.It\u2019s quite a nice thought.However, he was a transmigrator. One that came with a cheat at that.(Early Cultivation realms: Mortal Body, Spiritual Sea, Soul Palace, Transcendent, Omnipotent, Sacred Master, Lordly, Royal, Demi-god.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Black Colored Fortune, Must Slowly Stomp to DeathDead silence fell in the main hall.Comparing ability to show off against me?You\u2019re way to immature for that.Gu Changge didn\u2019t say a word. He just lightly shook his head.Clothes whiter than snow. Standing with his hands behind his back. His gaze deep and indifferent.It was like he was staring down at an ant trying to act up.Ye Chen knelt beneath him in an embarrassing state. His entire face was chalk white with unwillingness to accept the results. His entire body was soaked with sweat, unable to so much as lift his head.Everyone watched this scene in shock.For the people of the Taixuan Holy Land who had some understanding of Gu Changge, the shock in their minds were even greater than that of others.After all, judging from his age, Gu Changge\u2019s abilities shouldn\u2019t be too different from that of the younger generation in the Taixuan Holy Land.And yet, in reality, his true strength could match people on the same level as the Holy Master.\u201cYoung master Gu is so young, and yet his cultivation is inestimable\u2026\u201dAt that moment, the Taixuan Holy Master was the first to offer praise.At the same time, he took a glance at his daughter\u2019s slightly pale face.He silently sighed.If he knew beforehand, he would have crippled and expelled the problem known as Ye Chen from the sect a long time ago.Why did he have to offend this young master.At that moment, he had already decided in his mind what should be done with Ye Chen.\u201cThe Taixuan Holy Master overpraise me. This power of Changge truly isn\u2019t worth mentioning.\u201dGu Changge gave a smile at the praise. His words were calm and cool, giving the same impression as a spring breeze.However, he also showed an attitude of one high above and solitary.He didn\u2019t really take those words to heart.His original self was after all a prodigy type character who descended to the lower realm.Even in the upper realm, he was a young sovereign whose name resounded across the world.He was that strong from the start.Not something that any random mob could compare to.If he wanted to deal with Ye Chen attempting to show off.All he needed was to make the old master in his ring cautious and too scared to show himself.With that done, how would they possibly be able to aid Ye Chen?Gu Changge came down to the lower realm, but there was no way that he\u2019d come down without a personal protector.Just now, he surreptitiously contacted his protector and told him to intimidate the soul fragment in Ye Cheng\u2019s ring.From the current situation, things were progressing just as he anticipated.From now on, it\u2019\u2019d be far simpler when it comes to crushing this Child of Fortune.Ye Chen himself is probably still in trapped in the midst of shock and panic.Why did his 100% reliable master suddenly lose all contact?Gu Changge acted naturally, but he was laughing on the inside.\u201cTo have forced young master Gu to personally intervene. I am truly ashamed.\u201dAt that moment, the Taixuan Holy Child Chu Xuan spoke with an embarrassed expression.From just a glance, he was a character whose fate was to be his minion.Therefore, there was no way that Gu Changge would particularly blame him.Thus, he simply smiled comfortingly, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for Holy Child Chu Xuan to worry over it. Since this matter started due to myself, it\u2019s only natural that I be the one to resolve it.\u201d\u201cYoung master is generous. This Chu Xuan is humbled.\u201dJust as Gu Changge had expected, his words ended up making Chu Xuan only respect him more.It settled Chu Xuan\u2019s decision to bind himself to Gu Changge.That beautiful speech brought forth another wave of admiring sighs and gazes.This young master is truly no commoner, be it in his aura or talent.No, how could commoner even come close as a description?He was entirely inestimable and unreachable!\u201cYoung master Gu is truly strong. You can be said to be the divine, descended to the mortal world. Just the merest thread of his aura makes my heart tremble uncontrollably.\u201d\u201cOriginally, I thought that our Taixuan Holy Land, with its tens of millenniums of inheritance and millions of miles of land, is already a mighty titan standing astride the world. However, now that I\u2019ve seen the young master this day, I finally know that there are heavens beyond heaven, men beyond men\u2026\u201dThe various elders all joined in with flattery.This transformation of theirs into into simps greatly surprised those guests from major powers who didn\u2019t know the truth behind Gu Changge.They became even more curious as to the identity of this mysterious man in white.It seems that the Taixuan Holy Land, one of the six great Holy Lands of the Eastern Wilds, had at some point sneakily attached themselves to this young master\u2019s legs.This situation did not signify good things for the faction behind them.It really is nice to be the villain.People would fall over themselves to flatter you wherever you go.Not like the protagonist, who will get looked down on and sneered at wherever they go.As Gu Changge thought over things.He also contacted his system.As a transmigrator, how could he not have a cheat.His own cheat was very much like the status menus in the online games of his previous life.It showed various information about him.Via reversing the fate of various Children of Fortune, he could earn Fate Points.Fate Points were basically the same as the system currency, used for all kinds of things.Not only could he use it to buy various amazing cultivation arts.He could also use it to buy various talents, bloodlines, etc.He could even directly put points into various arts or his cultivation.Anyways, it can do pretty much anything that Gu Changge can think of.\u201cSystem.\u201dThat that moment, Gu Changge summoned up the system screen that only he could see.Master: Gu Changge.Identity: True disciple of the Daoist Deity Palace.Physique/Bloodline: Demonic Heart, Daoist BoneCultivation: Sacred Master realm, peak stageTechniques: Immortal Daoist Codex, Myriad Demon Form (Talent), Deity-Devouring Demonic Art\u2026Fate Points: 50.Fortune Value: 30 (Black)System Shop: Not unlocked.A very plain screen. All the information on it were obvious at a glance.50 Fate Points. That was what he got from humiliating Ye Cheng just now.\u201cSystem, if I were to kill Ye Chen right here and now, what would happen?\u201dGu Changge asked in his mind.\u201cBased on mater\u2019s current Fortune Value, the System does not suggest this course of action.\u201d\u201cThis is risk of backlash due to Fortune Value.\u201dAs he had thought.Gu Changge shook his head.He quietly cursed the shitty author and shitty world.What\u2019s with this setting?Humph, for someone of his talent and background to only have a Fortune Value of 30.And it\u2019s freaking black colored too.Then look at Ye Chen. Even now, with what had just happened, he still have several hundred points of fortune.Based on the system\u2019s explanations, fortune is split into 7 levels.Red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and violet.Normal people generally had red fortune.This Ye Chen\u2019s fortune had already reached the level of green.As for black, isn\u2019t that just misfortune?\u201cIf you go against a Child for Fortune, you will incur misfortune in turn.\u201d The system explained.And fortune backlash?Wasn\u2019t that stuff like randomly choking to death from drinking tea, or getting struck by lighting while taking a walk?\u201cIt looks like if I want to crush a Child of Fortune, I\u2019ll have to take it slowly. I\u2019ll have to first drain his fortune down to as low as possible first.\u201d\u201cThat said, the whole process of slowly crushing an ant could be pretty interesting in and of itself.\u201dGu Changge showed no outward signs as he quickly consulted with the system in his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Tonight\u2019s Moon is Quite Beautiful, Fate Points are Really Easy To Earn\u201cBasically, then, until the Child of Fortune\u2019s luck drops to a certain value, there\u2019s no way for me to kill him?\u201dThey\u2019ve been talking for a while now.When he heard the system say that, Gu Channge raised an eyebrow.\u201cYes Master. Fortune is something mysterious and imperceptible. With your current strength, you wouldn\u2019t have a hard time killing Ye Chen, but it would consequently bring about certain unknown changes.\u201d\u201cBecause Master is the biggest change.\u201d So the system explained.Gu Changge nodded. He understood now.As expected of a Child of Fortune. The heavens itself was keeping him safe.To give a simple example.Say that right now, Gu Changge really does try to kill Ye Chen. In that case, the heavens itself will drop a bolt of lightning down to strike him down first.However, so what if the heavens are protecting you.I can still take my time to toy with you until you die.Gu Changge laughed to himself in his mind. He didn\u2019t really mind all that much.Then, he gave a quick glance at the fortune values of everyone in the main hall.Besides Ye Chen\u2019s 500 points, Su Qingge\u2019s fortune value was the next highest, at 350 points.That confirmed Gu Changge\u2019s previous hypothesis.Su Qingge\u2019s position as the heroine was probably already set.Only, he had a thought: What if he were to eat up Su Qingge first?Would it still end up with him suffering from fortune backlash?If so, then it wouldn\u2019t really be worth it.Be it now or in his previous life.He had never been someone unbelievably thirst. He wasn\u2019t someone ruled by his lower half.After all, although the thing known as fortune is completely imperceptible, it does in fact exist.If he end up going too far and getting himself killed, then wouldn\u2019t that be a serious loss?Of course, there are still other methods.Wouldn\u2019t it be fine if he just burned away all their Fortune Value beforehand?Just like the system message he got just now.\u201cDing! Humiliating Ye Chen in front of a crowd. Ye Chen lost 10 Fortune Value. 50 Fate Points gained.\u201d50 Fate Points. You can\u2019t call that a lot, but it\u2019s not exactly few either.To Gu Changge though, there\u2019s quite a lot that he could still do.For example, raising his own cultivation level or natural potential.Compared to cultivating like everyone else, isn\u2019t it nice to just be able to add points in with his cheat?\u201cYe Chen dared to publicly challenge the rules of the sect, and even insulted the young master Gu. Guards! Throw him into the dungeons. Young master Gu will decide his fate.\u201dAt this moment, the high elder of the judgment hall spoke.He was a buff old man with a square face. Intimidating even when he wasn\u2019t mad.He was very respected and feared in the Taixuan Holy Land.Normally, he was scrupulously fair, and he even had a somewhat good opinion of Ye Chen.However, he understood that today, Ye Chen had offered offense to someone he shouldn\u2019t have.Compared to some minor inner disciple, it was obviously more important not to invite disaster upon the sect.Seeing that this elder of judgment had a probing, flattering gaze.Gu Channge nodded slightly.Then, he returned to his previous position, his face once again blank and unreadable.Allowing him to deal with Ye Chen?That\u2019s actually not a bad idea.Just never thought that a fair and uncompromising guy like you would be like that.He couldn\u2019t help but giggle on the inside.Following the dispersal of Gu Changge\u2019s crushing pressure.Ye Chen could finally stand back up, his face filled with shock, humiliation, and unwillingness to accept the results.His current mental state was practically identical to what Gu Changge had predicted.Why was it that his master stopped replying at such an important time?Had even she betrayed him?Or was it that even Master feared Gu Changge\u2019s background?At that moment, Ye Chen\u2019s heart turned cold. His gaze freezing.Especially when it comes to Su Qingge\u2019s behavior. From start to end, she hadn\u2019t spoken a word.She just stood there silently.She even took the initiative to pour tea for Gu Chengge.Ye Chen had saw all of it.For the goddess that he loved and admired to actively serve another man. Ye Chen\u2019s heart felt like it was breaking.Did she not see how, for her sake, he was willing to completely break with the Taixuan Holy Land?It can be said that Ye Chen\u2019s heart right now was very cold indeed.As for Su Qingge, it was impossible for her to not see Ye Chen\u2019s current expressions.She knows that Ye Chen had misunderstood.However, there was no way that she could allow the sect that raised her for over 20 years to fall into a crisis just for Ye Chen.Thus, all she could do was lower her head, clench her fists, and studiously avoid Ye Chen\u2019s gaze.\u201cHoly Maiden Qingge. I head that tonight\u2019s moon will be quite beautiful. Would you be willing to honor me by accompanying me to a viewing tonight?\u201dHowever, at this moment, Gu Changge suddenly spoke up.He had captured the expressions of both of them, so naturally he wouldn\u2019t let go of such a great opportunity.Upon his handsome and unblemished face, he showed a gentle smile at just the right degree.Those words made Su Qingge hesitate for a moment.For a second, she had blushed. She was a bit startled by how nicely he was acting.However, she soon realized Gu Changge\u2019s real intentions.Her body shook.Her face paled.Especially given that Gu Changge\u2019s dark eyes had an obvious hint of playfulness to them.Those words of his were spoken on purpose. He said them purposefully for Ye Chen to hear.Su Qingge understood that full well.The rest of the people in the main hall didn\u2019t realize though.All of them admired her right now.The Taixuan Holy Master showed his joy and tried to desperately signal his daughter with his eyes.If this young lord really did become taken with her.Even if she wasn\u2019t later taken to the upper realm.At that point, it would still be an unparalleled opportunity for the entire Taixuan Holy Land. One can even call it ascension to glory with but a single step.\u201cGu Changge. You\u2019re despicable. You\u2019re shameless. What\u2019s the point of pushing people around with authority? Push down your cultivation and have a fair match with me if you dare?\u201d\u201cYou shameless bastard. I\u2019ll definitely kill you one day!\u201dAt this moment, Ye Chen\u2019s eyes turned red and screamed out like he was going mad.Those words. Those actions. How could he possibly stand it.And yet, Gu Chengge didn\u2019t say a word in response.He simply lowered his gaze and took another sip of his tea. From start to end, he didn\u2019t so much as even glance up.,Splosh\u2026Finally, Ye Chen couldn\u2019t stand such humiliation anymore. He spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted.At that moment, a system message came.\u201cDing! Ye Chen\u2019s mental state damaged. 100 Fortune Value lost. 500 Fate Points gained.\u201dHmm\u2026These Fate Points really are easy to earn.Gu Changge sedately took another sip of tea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: Two Souls in One Body, The Taixuan Holy Master\u2019s DifficultiesDamaged the Child of fortune\u2019s Fortune Value by 100 points, and in return, he got 500 Fate Points.It looks like it\u2019s exchanged at a one to five ratio.That was what Gu Changge thought as he listened to the system message in his mind.He decided. When he has some time, he\u2019ll be using those Fate Points of his to boost his stat board.Within the main hall, the unconscious Ye Chen had been taken away by the Judgment Hall disciples.This particular scenario had finally concluded.The various guests were buzzing among themselves.\u201cThis young maser not only has unfathomable power, his background is likely also beyond imagining.\u201d\u201cAfter all, the Taixuan Holy Master was going as far as having his own daughter personally keep him company\u2026\u201dThe vast majority of people looked on with appraising eyes and started guessing at Gu Changge\u2019s identity.They\u2019ve all decided.Later, they\u2019ll need to properly report everything that had happened to their sects.If there\u2019s a chance, make sure to have some more contact with this young master. It would definitely be to their advantage.Of course, it was also predictable that the Eastern Wilds will be undergoing some major turmoil not long from now.Soon, the inauguration ceremony ended.At the banquet, the Taixuan Holy Child Chu Xuan was quite full of himself, looking down on the others of his generation within the sect.Then, he respectfully served a cup of wine to Gu Changge at the head of the table, \u201cMany thanks to the young master for your aid. If you have any need of me in the future, I will follow along no matter the hardship.\u201dAnyone with intelligence could see that it was basically a declaration of servitude.Since he could use a minion anyways.This Chu Xuan is the Taixuan Holy Child at that.He\u2019ll do.Gu Changge accepted the wine with a smile and drank it in one gulp, \u201cIt is but a minor matter. There\u2019s no need for Brother Chu Xuan to mind it.\u201cMany thanks.\u201dChu Xuan was overjoyed.\u201cThis old man also present a toast to the young master\u2026\u201d\u201cFor the young master to descend to our lower realm, it truly is our Eastern Wild\u2019s honor\u2026\u201dNone of the elders or disciples here were idiots. They obviously understood the logic behind it, so they also started joining in and raising toasts.At the same time, they were cursing at Chu Xuan for his cunning.He normally didn\u2019t show it at all.But they never imagined that his abilities at flattery were so good.With just a moment\u2019s work, he got to become this young master\u2019s minion.For many disciples, they admired and envied him.\u201cQingge\u2026\u201dThe Taixuan Holy Master noticed that his daughter seemed somewhat pale and lost.He frowned.Just a moment ago, the young lord Gu seemed to rather favor his daughter.Yet, why is it that he\u2019s now completely ignoring her?\u201cFather\u2026\u201dSu Qingge shook her head. Her face turned pale.She didn\u2019t explain.How could Gu Changge possibly be interested in her.That show earlier was done purely for Ye Chen to see.She didn\u2019t know what kind of grudge existed between Ye Chen and Gu Changge, for him to purposefully shame Ye Chen like that.However, she does know that at this moment, it\u2019s best not to make Gu Changge upset.With his status, how could he possibly lack talented beauties around him?Su Qingge is very smart, so she clearly understood her own worth.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dThe Taixuan Holy Master wasn\u2019t stupid either. He could guess at some things from his daughter\u2019s expressions.He showed his worry on his face.Hearing her father sigh like that, Su Qingge didn\u2019t feel very good either.She knows what her father is like.She knew that he probably had some difficulties of his own, for him to do such things.She gave Gu Changge a glance and hesitated a moment.Finally, she grit her teeth and decided. When he banquet is over, she\u2019ll put aside her pride and go apologize.After all, she was technically the reason for that matter earlier today.However, Gu Changge never so much as looked at her. He had already left while chatting with Chu Xuan and headed to his own room.His earlier words about a beautiful moon and watching it together was like a mere joke.Of course, Gu Changge was obviously only joking about.He didn\u2019t have the free time to accompany Su Qingge to a moon viewing or anything.Although a melon, forcibly taken, does quench one\u2019s thirst.But if he ends up eating fortune backlash, he could very well end up getting attacked by some divine beast from some unknown dimension.That risk was just plain not worth it.A mere Su Qingge might be quite beautiful. Her fluttery white dress made her look quite moving and not of this world.But she\u2019s still not worth it.As she saw Gu Changge had already walked a distance away, Su Qingge was rooted in place, dumbfounded. She didn\u2019t even have a chance to say the words she wanted to.Her personality tended toward the cool and quiet side.Although she normally doesn\u2019t talk much, but it was the first time that she had met someone so contemptuous towards her.In contrast, whenever Ye Chen spoke even a sentence to her, he\u2019d end up in a great mood for the rest of the day.Su Qingge sighed again in her mind and prepared to try to salvage things.\u201cGu Changge is truly hard to get a grasp on, as a person\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s much more interesting than that Ye Chen or whatever.\u201dAt that moment, in her mind, a female voice rang out with a teasing tone.Although the voice sounded heavenly, there was a terrifying evilness to it.However, Su Qingge had been long familiar with it.She didn\u2019t outwardly react at all.That voice had been with her ever since the moment she was born.It was a secret that even her father didn\u2019t know.Two souls in one body.Late at night.At Gu Changge\u2019s room.An old man with unclear features appeared out of nothingness.\u201cHow goes the information gathering?\u201dGu Changge was sitting on his bed in a lotus position. He retracted his will from the system screen, opened his eyes, and asked.\u201cMy lord, things were just as you had thought.\u201d\u201cThe Taixuan Holy Master called Su Qingge over and told her of his reasons and difficulties.\u201d\u201cWhat difficulties?\u201dGu Changge raised an eyebrow.The old man in black answered respectfully, \u201cThe strongest High Elder of the Taixuan Holy land had in fact died 300 years ago. It\u2019s just that the news weren\u2019t leaked out to the outside world. The Taixuan Holy Land desperately needs to find someone new to rely on.\u201d\u201cBesides that, the Taixuan Holy Master\u2019s wife was a noblewoman of the upper realm. Years ago, she was taken back to the upper world by some faction. The Taixuan Holy Master hoped to use Su Qingge to craft a relationship with you, and use that connection to find a trace of his wife.\u201d\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t expect to have guessed right.\u201dGu Changge grinned.He thought it over a little while ago. Since Su Qingge is the heroine, she must have something uncommon about her.Thus, he had the old man in black gather some information.The old man in black is called Old Ming.He was basically Gu Changge\u2019s personal guard in his trip to the lower realm. He was very strong.Never mind the Taixuan Holy Land, even within the entirety of the Eastern Wilds, there aren\u2019t many places that Old Ming can\u2019t get into.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Newbie Bundle. System, Spend My PointsAfter getting Su Qingge\u2019s message, Gu Changge fell silent.\u201cYoung master, I still have one thing I don\u2019t understand.\u201dOld Ming showed a hint of confusion.Based on Gu Changge\u2019s personality.All of his orders are clearly understandable. They all have proper reasoning for them.But he just could not understand. Why did the young master have him suppress the area around Ye Chen today?It was normal for Old Ming to ask such a question.After transmigrating and integrating his previous self\u2019s memories, Gu Changge had long since thought of a good excuse.Thus, he answered calmly and evenly, \u201cYe Chen carries with him a great aura of fortune. Through him, I can find my own fortuitous treasure.Those words were actually quite true in a way.After all, he skill needs to scheme ways to steal Ye Chen\u2019s Fortune Value.Plus, a Child of Fortune will definitely not lack for fortuitous encounters.Isn\u2019t it his duty to steal Ye Chen\u2019s opportunities?As Gu Changge thought that, he slightly shook his head.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Old Ming nodded, enlightened.The young master was known as one divinely born.He could see a lot further and clearer than even those of the older generations.After all, the young master officially descended to the lower realm for training, but in reality, he was searching for a certain treasure.\u201cHead to the dungeons and observe Ye Chen\u2019s each and every more. Don\u2019t interfere no matter what happens.\u201d Gu Changge thought of something and added a word of warning.He already grasped the way to drain away Fortune Value.One way was by dealing blows to Ye Chen.Another way is to steal away his fortuitous encounters.There are some things that not even the heavens can easily help with. Personal relationships for one.Just like here. There\u2019s probably already quite a few fractures between Ye Chen and the heroine Su Qingge by now.\u201cYes young master.\u201dOld Ming acknowledged his orders and slowly faded away into the void.To decrease Ye Chen\u2019s Fortune Value through the heroine Su Qingge.It\u2019s not a bad methodBack in the main hall, just by using certain methods via Su Qingge, he had damaged Ye Chen\u2019s mental state.It proved that destroying the relationship between the Child of Fortune and the heroine was workable.Plus, after having grasped Su Qingge\u2019s weakness, there\u2019s quite a few things he could do through her.\u201cSu Qingge has over 300 good Fortune Points on her. Kinda makes me salivate.\u201dAs he thought that, Gu Changge shook his head. There was a strange expression on his face. He\u2019s gotten more used to his current identity.The next moment, he summoned up his system.The status board appeared before him.Master: Gu Changge.Identity: True disciple of the Daoist Diety Palace.Physique/Bloodline: Demonic Heart, Daoist BoneCultivation: Sacred Master realm, peak stageTechniques: Immortal Daoist Codex, Myriad Demon Form (Talent), Deity-Devouring Demonic Art\u2026Fate Points: 550.Fortune Value: 30 (Black)System Shop: Automatically unlocked at 1000 Fate Points.Inventory: Newbie bundle x1 (Awaiting acceptance).\u201cNewbie bundle?\u201dSuddenly Gu Changge noticed and discovered that he seemed to have forgotten something.He didn\u2019t notice the existence of inventory before.\u201cAccept?\u201d The System message appeared.Gu Changge let out a laugh. It\u2019s not like he could chose no now, right?\u201cAccept.\u201dHe mentally commanded.Buzz!Soon, a golden chest shining with divine light appeared. It shined brilliantly before him before slowly opening.\u201cDing! Congratulations to the Master for your good luck. Gained boundary breaker talisman x1, five colored mystic robe x1, 1/3 fragment of a world seed x1.\u201dThe system message rang out next to his ears.Gu Changge considered. It seems that this thing was like the gacha in games. It depends all on luck.Although his personal fortune value was terrible, it doesn\u2019t seem to actually matter when it came to the system.Three items. It doesn\u2019t seem half bad.Boundary breaker talisman. The name says it all. It can break apart boundaries and barriers.Five colored mystic robe. It\u2019s a defensive artifact. Gu Changge took a look at the description and fount that it was actually quite strong.It can block a single full powered strike from someone of the Demi-god realm.Mortal Body, Spiritual Sea, Soul Palace, Transcendent, Omnipotent, Sacred Master, Lordly, Royal, Demi-god.Those are the how the cultivation levels that he is familiar with are broken up.As for above Demi-god, there are yet more realms. However, that\u2019s a completely different world. The powers involved can shatter the heavens and earth, so they\u2019re not to be spoken of.Right after, Gu Changge put on the five colored mystic robe.From the outer appearance, it looked like a white inner shirt. The materials looked rather mysterious, much like a true mystic robe, giving off a faint glow.Beyond the fact that one could tell that it\u2019s no average item there weren\u2019t really anything special about it.Then, he noticed that fragment of a world seed and started checking the description.\u201cA completely world seed, after refining, can allow one to create a world within oneself. That world can maintain its own life and ecosystem.\u201d\u201cInteresting. A world within one\u2019s body?\u201dSomething like that could be called a divine item.Gu Changge\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but flash at that.He was just thinking about how to run away if he really did encounter danger in the future.An inner world was a great place for running away to.After all, no one can guarantee that they won\u2019t ever end up in a bad situation.Too bad that it was only a third right now.Gu Changge sighed, \u201cWell, whatever. Let\u2019s leave it be for now. Right now, let\u2019s raise my cultivation first.\u201dWhatever the world, strength conquers all.No one can stop me from cultivating.\u201cDark Blue, spend the points.\u201d (T/N note: A reference to a novel, Way of the Devil/\u6781\u9053\u5929\u9b54)\u201cOops, that\u2019s wrong. System, spend the points.\u201dCan you really call the Fate Points that he worked hard to earn cheating?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: Veggie Harvesting. Ye Chen\u2019s Mysterious MasterImmortal Daoist Codex.That was the art that Gu Changge cultivates.At the same time, it\u2019s an art that only the true disciples of the Daoist Divine Palace have the right to use. It\u2019s a direct path to divinity, a foundation of immortal teachings.There were countless immortal factions and mighty lineages who would salivate at the sight of it.Currently, Gu Changge has cultivated it to the sixth level. Among his peers of the same generation in the upper realm, he still counts as one of the very top.However, even with his original self\u2019s great talent, he had been stuck here for nearly half a year now, unable to break through to the next level.\u201cSince I can just directly pour Fate Points in, then I can just directly use it to increase the level of the cultivation art, which would naturally result in cultivation breakthroughs.\u201dGu Changge\u2019s idea was simple.He has a whopping 550 Fate Points to spend.\u201cSystem. Spend the points.\u201dWith that thought, Gu Changge felt a pure energy flow through his entire body.At the same time, there was a mysterious and mystical feeling in his mind.It as a number of understandings relating to the Immortal Daoist Codex.Then, he had completely grasped them.His Fate points were quickly decreasing before his eyes.Buzz!Finally, he had broken through to the seventh level of the Immortal Daoist Codex.In the palace, thunderous sounds exploded out from nothingness.Majestic might descended, covering the area.The area around the main hall was dead silent.The guards on station showed their utter shock.The two of them exchange a look before stuttering out.\u201cThat aura just now. How is it so terrifying\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like the palace was hiding a world class great demon.\u201d\u201cWatch your words. Those words cannot be spoken.\u201dThe two of them were completely covered in cold sweat. They were close to collapsing to the ground.Was that young lord really just cultivating in there?\u201dThis aura really was just too terrifying.\u201cSo this is the power of the Lordly Realm huh? As terrifying as expected.\u201dWithin the palace, Gu Changge let out a light laugh and breathed out.The space in front of him instantly let out a wave of terrifying booms.An aura even stronger and more terrifying than before expanded out from his form.His blood vessels, organs, and even skeleton was filled with a feeling of preciousness, as if they have undergone a round of refining.A faint wisp of the Dao as well as terrifying demonic aura resided in his heart and bones.Since his cultivation broke through, all of Gu Changge\u2019s many talents also improved.Even his physical form had become much stronger.Demonic Heart, Daoist BonesThat was quite far from ordinary.Of course, based on his original self\u2019s memories, this will likely end up dragging him into the path of another Child of Fortune.Oh, no. That should be a Daughter of Fortune.The Demonic Heart was his own.But the Daoist Bones weren\u2019t.\u201cIt looks like this Immortal Daoist Codex is pretty high level. I ended up spending so much Fate Points just for a single breakthrough.\u201dSoon, Gu Changge couldn\u2019t smile anymore.Cultivation breakthrough was a good thing.This sensation of power and control over all really was quite nice.But over 500 Fate Points had been completely spent just now.All that proves is that the Immortal Daoist Codex really is a bit too high leveled.A direct path to divinity. Perhaps it\u2019s not just boasting.\u201cWell, whatever. I still have the veggie known as Ye Chen just waiting for me to harvest. I\u2019ll have plenty of Fate Points in the future.\u201dSoon through, Gu Changge stopped minding it.After all, there are still plenty of things waiting for him.Ye Chen, although you look quite discomposed while you\u2019re working hard cultivating, you\u2019re very nice looking indeed when it\u2019s time for me to harvest.\u2026At the same time.The dark dungeons of the Taixuan Holy Land.The atmosphere was damp. The air moldy. It was filed with a scent akin to that of rotting corpses.Ye Chen sat there, dumbfounded. His eyes were blank and his expression dumb.His cultivation was sealed and he was cuffed. He still hasn\u2019t pulled himself from the enormous humiliation that he experienced today.All this time, apart from that first time when his former fiancee had shamed him three years ago.Had he ever experienced such a humiliation as today\u2019s?No matter what kind of predicament he met with, he could always find a way out from the jaws of disaster and grasp safety from danger.But today, things seem to be different?\u201cGu Changge\u2026\u201dYe Chen\u2019s eyes turned red. He practically roared out that name syllable by syllable.The moment he thought of that enemy sitting high above looking down on everything with a cold expression.His heart would go mad with aggravation. He couldn\u2019t take it at all.\u201cLittle Chen\u2026\u201dAt that moment, a pleasing voice came from the ring on his finger.Ye Chen stopped.Then, he showed an expression of anger and unwillingness to accept reality.\u201cMaster. Where did you go? Why didn\u2019t you answer me when I was calling for you\u2026\u201dYe Chen had released all the hatred in his head onto his master.Speaking of, the reason he could have gotten to where he was today was undeniably linked to his master in his ring.However, what had happened this day in the great hall made Ye Chen rather disappointed.His normally incomparably reliable Master had disappeared at a crucial moment.Was she scared of Gu Changge too?\u201cLittle Chen, listen to my explanation. Things aren\u2019t what you think.\u201dWithin the ring, a very faint figure of a woman showed a bitter smile.Although Ye Chen was blaming her like that, she didn\u2019t take it to mind. That\u2019s because she did have something to do with it in the end.\u201cBack then, a very terrifying existence had covered the entire main hall with his will. I suspected that it might be related to the enemy who caused my fall back then, so I didn\u2019t dare show myself\u2026\u201dThe woman in the ring explained.After all, right now, she\u2019s just a wisp of a soul remnant. There really was just far too few things that she could actually do.If she got found my her enemy from a moment\u2019s inattention, then all that remains for her is complete annihilation.Thus, she has to be extremely careful.After Ye Chen vented for a bit, he also calmed down.When he heard, his eyes opened up wide and spoke with some shock, \u201cNo wonder the Taixuan Holy Master acted in such a way toward Gu Changge. So he came from the upper realm?\u201dAccording to his understanding, his own master was once a powerful existence in the upper realm.However, she was met with an enemy\u2019s attacks in secret and ended up as a soul remnant that fell to the lower realm. In the end, she possessed a ring which he then later obtained.But he had never imagined that Gu Changge\u2019s origins would be so terrifying.Ye Chen fell silent.For a moment, he was at a lose with despair.Does he really have to give up on Su Qingge and allow her to fall to hell?Ye Chen clenched his fists, unwilling to accept that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: Yan Ji. To Capture, One Must First ReleaseWithin the cold prison cell.Ye Chen and his mysterious master were currently talking, discussing how to figure out a way out.\u201cThis matter requires long term planning. Gu Changge\u2019s origins are terrifying and hard to imagine. Plus, he had someone powerful hidden behind him at that, so you mustn\u2019t face him head on right now\u2026\u201d\u201cSpeaking of this matter, you shouldn\u2019t have been so reckless.\u201dYe Chen\u2019s master spoke out.Her name was Yan Ji. Her figure was faint. She had a pair of strange but pretty scarlet eyes.Right now, her beautiful features were schooled in a very serious expression.Although she\u2019s just a soul remnant, a portion of her former great beauty was still visible.\u201cI know master. Sorry.\u201dAfter Ye Chen had calmed down, he was a bit regretful.He shouldn\u2019t have gotten mad at his beautiful master and vented on her.Thank goodness that his master didn\u2019t get mad at him. The fact that she instead tried to advise him greatly moved him.Of course, as to the matter of recklessness.Ye Chen won\u2019t admit to that. At the time, he had already thought of proper countermeasures.It was just that a problem happened with his master at the most critical moment.\u201cI know master. From today on, I\u2019ll keep my head down. Only when I\u2019ve become strong will I have the chance to slay that Gu Changge.\u201dYe Chen swore while gritting his teeth.He had thought it through.In the end, he still doesn\u2019t want to give up.He felt that Su Qingge wasn\u2019t doing any of this of her own free will. She must have had her own problems.Or rather, Gu Changge must have been forcing her.This bit made Yan Ji frown. She sighed to herself.From her point of view, Ye Chen\u2019s mentality was still too immature.He offended someone he shouldn\u2019t have for a woman.Plus, when considering the matter, Gu Changge hadn\u2019t actually done anything wrong.However, Ye Chen was her personal disciple after all. The fact that she was able to awaken in the first place was due to the spirit energy that he so painfully cultivated.Thus, Yan Ji didn\u2019t actually say those thoughts out loud.\u201cThere are many strong individuals locked up in this dungeon. Perhaps it\u2019s a possible method for escaping\u2026\u201dYe Chen thought to himself. He refused to just sit and accept his fate.Since the Taixuan Holy Land was the first to betray him, there\u2019s no need for him to care about them!He held quite a bit of hate in his heart.The two of them were quite secretive in their communications. However, they had no idea that there was a hidden pair of eyes that was observing it all take place.Old Ming had purposefully kept himself unseen.That master of Ye Chen might have been strong once upon a time, but being just a soul remnant now, she\u2019d have a very hard time discovering him.\u201cIs this the fortuitous chance that the young master spoke of?\u201d\u201cA mere soul remnant of someone once mighty?\u201dOld Ming frowned.No matter how he looks at it, he couldn\u2019t see anything unusual about this Ye Chen.It was instead the ring on his finger that was a little bit strange.There was some faint soul emanations coming from it.Based on the mental communications just how, it proves that there was someone much greater behind him.However, Gu Changge\u2019s orders for him was to only observe Ye Chen\u2019s every move, and to not interfere with anything else.Thus, Old Ming didn\u2019t to anything.Three days had passed in the blink of an eye.It seems like everyone of the Taixuan Holy Land had forgotten about the matter with Ye Chen being locked up in the dungeons.If Gu Changge doesn\u2019t bring it up first, who would dare to question it?For a mere inner disciple to have offended such an existence. It wouldn\u2019t have been too much even if he was locked up his whole life until he died of old age.Gu Changge was in a very good mood.Over the last three days, Old Ming had reported to him daily about everything that was happening in the dungeons.Gu Changge had basically managed to completely understand the matter with Ye Chen and that master of his.It was the same old clich\u00e9.The only difference is the people in question.The reason that Ye Chen could come so far, beyond the influence of his ungodly luck, was definitely due to that mysterious master of his in most cases.Without an old master accompanying him, he\u2019s nothing at all.Although Gu Changge had indeed considered just directly taking Ye Chen\u2019s ring.The most likely result of that though is that mysterious master of him would push itself beyond their limits and ensure Ye Chen\u2019s escape even at the risk of their soul remnant being destroyed.In addition to the influence of his luck further protecting him.This method was rather risky.There was practically no chance of it actually going right.If something went wrong, it might end up with both him and Old Ming dying here.\u201cSowing discord is actually pretty nice too.\u201d\u201cAlthough, isn\u2019t that a bit too evil for a villain like me?\u201d\u201cNo no no. I\u2019m doing this for the Fate Points. For the sake of working hard in cultivating.\u201dThat\u2019s completely just.While he was thinking that.Gu Changge noticed that there seemed to be some kind of activity being prepared in the main hall.At this moment, one of the guards stationed outside the palace came in to report.\u201cMy lord. The Holy Maiden wishes for an audience.\u201dHearing that, Gu Changge came back to himself, wiped the smile from his face, recovered his blank expression, and spoke indifferently, \u201cAllow her in.\u201dNo matter what, a villain need to act cool.He had already left Su Qingge alone for three days now, so it\u2019s about time he met her again.Gu Changge was after all someone who had read tons of web novels in his previous life.When it comes to a smart heroine like Su Qingge, especially after he knows her weakness.It\u2019s very easy to deal with her.First, grind down her temperment some.After all, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s a simp who\u2019d end up rooted to the ground at the sight of a beautiful woman.Plus, wasn\u2019t there a saying \u201cto capture, one must first release\u201d? (T/N: Reference to the 16th of the 36 Stratagems)Wait until she\u2019s on the edge of despair, and only then show her the light of hope.Over the past three days, the Taixuan Holy Master had been worried sick, sighing all over the place.The reason?His daughter seemed to have done something to made the young lord Gu unhappy.The Taixuan Holy Master didn\u2019t dare to ask Gu Changge about this either.Su Qingge was a very filial daughter, so she naturally didn\u2019t want to his her father like that.That was one of her weaknesses that Gu Changge had grasped.\u201cQingge greets young lord Gu.\u201dAt that moment, following a pleasant voice.Su Qingge slowly walked into the palace with some hesitation.She was no longer able to act nearly as calm as she did back in the beginning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: First Conquer the Heart. The Heroine\u2019s SubmissionIt must be said.As the heroine well suited to be paired with the Child of Fortune.Su Qingge\u2019s appearance is quite flawless.Her features are delicate and well formed.Her eyes were like the streams in autumn, her brows beautiful as the mountains.Her dark hair perfectly framed her face, which was pale and smooth, glistening with a light that captures the heart.Her white dress flowed about her, giving her an otherworldly impression. Her aura was peaceful and calm to the point where it was hard to describe with words.She was like a divine maiden of the heavens that had accidentally fallen to the world below.However, now she had a somewhat perturbed look.After all, she had only been let in to see him after three full days of asking. It really made it difficult for her to figure out what Gu Changge\u2019s true thoughts were.All the men she had come into contact before were like Ye Chen, who gazed up at her with admiration.Like facing a goddess, they\u2019re allowed to look but not touch.It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s met someone like Gu Changge who could completely ignore her.Thus, Su Qingge was somewhat nervous. She feared rejection.However, that wasn\u2019t enough to shake her determination.For the past three days, she had been consulting with her other soul. She had already thought through what to do next to overturn the current situation.\u201cWhat business might Holy Maiden Qingge have with me?\u201dWithin the hall, Gu Changge sat in lotus position up on the dais, opened his eyes, and calmly spoke.His expressions were cold.Like a god looking down upon the entire world.He obviously knew Su Qingge\u2019s intentions.However, he didn\u2019t say anything.At this point, if he wanted her to submit, he must not be too gentle.Su Qingge\u2019s Fortune Value is something that had to do with her status as the heroine.But what if the heroine \u201cwillingly\u201d submitted to him as the villain?What would happen then?Gu Changge was quite curious about that.And contrary to Ye Chen, he already had a grasp on Su Qingge\u2019s weakness, so it was much simpler for him to take her down.\u201cQingge had come here in order to apologize to lord Gu for the matter three days ago.\u201dAt this moment, Su Qingge spoke up to Gu Changge.It was something that she had wanted to do all this time, but unfortunately, Gu Changge never gave her the chance.\u201cOh? What does Holy Maiden Qingge have to apologize for?\u201dGu Changge asked back without any change in expression.\u201cThe matter with Ye Chen originally came up because of me, but I didn\u2019t warn lord Gu ahead of time. Thus, this was my wrong\u2026\u201dIt must be said, Su Qingge was quite smart. Her current explanation was plain without a hint of reticence.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t be fooled when it came to most things, so she might as well just be honest.She also took the opportunity to reveal how she ended up getting to know Ye Chen.She didn\u2019t even hide the matter with Ye Chen\u2019s own admiration or her.Before an existence like Gu Changge, the only thing she could do was to confess everything so as to show her own sincerity.\u201cThis woman is quite interesting.\u201dAt this moment, Gu Changge started involuntarily showing a hint of interest on his face.Truth be told, he was a bit taken off guard.Perhaps not even Ye Chen would have imagined that Su Qingge would tell Gu Changge everything.A woman this smart, all he could say is as expected of the heroine.A personality like this is completely different from those flower vases that can only look pretty.She knew how to maneuver around danger and seek out advantages.Right now, the sect was in trouble. Thus, she knew full well what she should be doing, and won\u2019t be doing anything stupid.To the Taixuan Holy Land, Gu Changge is the greatest backing they could get.Compared to Ye Chen, she placed not offending Gu Changge as the higher priority.There was a saying about how the situation is greater than personal wishes that fits quite well here.At this point, Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but appreciate her.Of course that was just pure appreciation.It\u2019s not lust over her body.\u201cDing! Su Qingge\u2019s temperament has changed. Ye Chen\u2019s Fortune Value has decreased by 40. 200 Fate Points gained.\u201dAt this moment, the system pinged.Gu Changge narrowed his eyes.Interesting.It looks like if he changes the path of people related to the Child of Fortune, it would also damage his Fortune Value and give him Fate Points.In that case, things have become much simpler.\u201cWhat is your intentions in telling me all this? Did you think that I\u2019m interested in you?\u201d\u201cDo you want to use this opportunity to get me to release Ye Chen?\u201dHowever, Gu Changge didn\u2019t go any easier on her at all. His cold words carried with it a hint of a sneer.Although Su Qingge had already anticipated such a response.She still couldn\u2019t help but turn pale and explained in a panic, \u201cI do not dare. Qingge knows that her lacking appearance could not possibly enter lord Gu\u2019s eyes. All this is simply to show my sincerity in the hopes of you overlooking the incident that day.\u201d\u201cAs for Ye Chen, Qingge is incapable of changing anything. Lord Gu is overthinking it.\u201d\u201cOh. Ye Chen was so infatuated with you though that he was willing to break with the Taixuan Holy Land over you. Is this attitude of yours really suitable?\u201dGu Changge\u2019s had a playful quality to his gaze.Those words make Su Qingge visibly wince.\u201cIt\u2019s for the sect. This is my father\u2019s life\u2019s work. Compared to that, all that is no longer important.\u201dSu Qingge\u2019s eyes dimmed.Gu Changge\u2019s expressions continued to be cold, and he stopped speaking.However, in his mind, he was already laughing.First conquer the heart.This method really is great.\u201cLord Gu, there\u2019s actually one more thing. Qingge\u2019s constitution is that of the Nine Yin Mystic Concubine Body. This is a matter known only by myself.\u201dAt this moment, seeing Gu Changge\u2019s expressions, she once again spoke up.In order to show her sincerity, she revealed this secret.Nine Yin Mystic Concubine Body?Gu Changge naturally had such information about such a constitution in his memories.However, for Su Qingge to tell him this without prompting.He didn\u2019t expect that at all.Soon though, Gu Changge somewhat understood the meaning behind her actions.It\u2019s basically leverage that can be used to control Su Qingge. For her to hand said leverage to him could also be considered a proper show of her sincerity to accompany her previous apology.Isn\u2019t this the first step in this heroine\u2019s submission to him?\u201cDing! Su Qingge started showing willingness to submit. Ye Chen\u2019s Fortune Value decreased by 40. 200 Fate Points gained.\u201dThe system message pinged again at this moment.Gu Changge didn\u2019t expec that.The process of getting Su Qingge to fully submit had gone unexpectedly smoothly.With this, Ye Chen\u2019s Fortune Value had already dropped to about 300 some points.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: Believe In the Young Lord. Decent Self-DelusionsSu Qingge in actuality had deeply consider the matter before she said it.She was a very smart woman.The other soul of hers had its own wisdom too. It helped her a lot with planning and coming up with ideas.Gu Changge\u2019s majesty was just too heavy. Sometimes, he\u2019s just completely cold, gazing down on all.Yet, sometimes, it feels like he\u2019s toying around with the world. It made him really unpredictable.He wasn\u2019t like Ye Chen, who was pure like a blank slate.But that was the reason why Su Qingge was so nervous.It can\u2019t be helped. The only thing she could do was display her sincerity.Nine Yin Mystic Concubine Body. If it was exposed that she had a body so perfect for being made a cauldron.She would definitely become targeted by a lot of old monsters.For her to tell Gu Changge such a thing was basically a guarantee that she would not dare to have any disloyal thoughts toward him.Su Qingge knows that with Gu Changge\u2019s capabilities, he would definitely understand her intentions.Thus, now she needs to observe just what how Gu Changge would react to all this.\u201cNine Yin Mystic Concubine Body. That\u2019s a perfect constitution as a cauldron. You actually just revealed it to me just like that?\u201dGu Changge\u2019s voice was steady, not revealing any of his actual feelings.Su Qingge lowered her head and spoke softly, \u201cI believe in the young lord as a person.\u201dThose words were merely polite talk.Is Gu Changge really such an upright person?He hides his thoughts deeply and is hard to predict. He\u2019s more like a villain than anything else.At the very least, she couldn\u2019t tell what he\u2019s actually like as a person.\u201cWhat insincere words.\u201dGu Changge let out a laugh.Su Qingge pursed her lips and didn\u2019t respond.Gu Changge gave her a glance.A lovely and admirable heroine was standing before him like that.Her features were delicate and well formed.Her eyes were like the streams in autumn, her brows beautiful as the mountains.Her dark hair perfectly framed her face, which was pale and smooth, glistening with a light that captures the heart.And there was a hint of nervousness to her countenance.Truth be told, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s Liu Xiahui. (T/N: Reference to Zhan Huo, ancient Chinese official famed for his virtue)Facing the Su Qingge\u2019s situation, he didn\u2019t try to help or force her.Everything happened by her own free choice.It was completely just.\u201cSystem, what about this situation where she\u2019s giving herself to me? Would there be fortune backlash if I were to eat her up now?\u201dOf course, Gu Changge will still consult the system first.Out of everything in the world, it\u2019s his own life that\u2019s the most important here.So long as it doesn\u2019t endanger his own life, he wouldn\u2019t care one bit just what Su Qingge\u2019s really thinking.Only the protagonist worry over feelings.He\u2019s the villain, so of course he\u2019s going the physical route.He wanted to take her forcibly before, but he was afraid of the fortune backlash.But now she\u2019s the one who\u2019s handing herself over.\u201cBased on the heroine\u2019s current fortune value, she has not truly submitted to the master yet. Any relation right now has a high likelihood of causing a fortune backlash.\u201dThe system so explained.Fine. He should have expected this.Shitty world. Worthless fortune.In the far east, a certain divine crab monster was watching and waiting. (T/N: Reference to Baidu internet meme)Things were within Gu Changge\u2019s expectations.Of course, he didn\u2019t show the slightest change in his expressions and continued to speak indifferently, \u201cI shall pretend that I didn\u2019t hear anything about the Nine Yin Mystic Concubine Body today. If Holy Maiden Qingge wanted to use that to tempt me, I\u2019ll ask you to leave instead.\u201d\u201cMiss. Please have some self respect.\u201dHis countenance showed a mix of indifference and a dismissive attitude of \u201cmy focus is on cultivation. Women or whatever can get lost\u201d.Hmm, hmm, hmm.At this moment, Gu Changge was somewhat in awe of his own acting skills.If the system had it\u2019s own thoughts and will.It would definitely be loudly insulting Gu Changge\u2019s shamelessness right now.Just who was is lusting after the girl\u2019s body just now?\u201cLord Gu\u2026\u201dThose words had stunned Su Qingge for a moment. Her beautiful was was contorted into an expression of shock.She had actually already prepared herself for the worst when she came over today.But that was something that couldn\u2019t be helped.However, Gu Changge\u2019s words had completely flabbergasted her.Of course, more of her was relieved.\u201cThis Gu Changge really is hard to figure out, I can\u2019t guess at what he\u2019s thinking at all\u2026\u201dAt this moment, the other soul in her body spoke up with the exact same thought as herself.\u201cLord Gu did not take advantage of my weakness. It looks like I\u2019ve been wrong in thinking badly of him\u2026\u201d\u201cIn this case, I\u2019m the one who was small minded.\u201dAfter she made her farewell from the hall, Su Qingge silently thought that to herself.Her whole mood had for some reason become much brighter.It wasn\u2019t dead and gloomy like she was before.Thinking on the whole matter carefully, Lord Gu didn\u2019t seem to have done anything wrong that day in the main hall, right?The night she went to his place, he didn\u2019t bother her at all. In fact, he didn\u2019t even care to notice her.Wasn\u2019t it normal for him t be shrewd and subtle?It\u2019s not like her own actions normally are any different.When she thought of that, Su Qingge suddenly felt somewhat guilty.Just why did she jump to conclusions and think of Gu Changge as a bad person before?\u201cDing! Su Qingge\u2019s opinions have change. 20 Fortune Value gained. 100 Fate Points gained.At the same time.In Gu Changge\u2019s mind, system message pinged.When he heard those notifications, he kind of lacked the words to describe his thoughts.Was Su Qingge deluding herself right now? Conquering herself for me?But overthinking things into misunderstanding worked too.That said, he never imagined that the method to increase his own Fortune Value layed with the heroine.However, either way.He really did earn a heck of a lot of Fate Points with what he did this day.It was so worth it.400.200.100.All together, he had earned a total of 700 Fate points.Ye Chen\u2019s own Fortune Value had dropped to about 300 points.For this Child of Fortune, he definitely lost a major pound of flesh this day.Gu Changge was in quite a good mood.He didn\u2019t hurry in using those 700 Fate Points either. He decided to save it up until the system shop was unlocked and see what\u2019s in there.Although he wasn\u2019t lacking in powerful techniques.It\u2019s not like he\u2019d reject even more powerful techniques.Plus, now that he\u2019s finished his preparations, it\u2019s about time he started going after Ye Chen\u2019s master.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Sowing Discord. Agreed to the Statement of IdiocyWithin the dark and damp prison cell.Ye Chen looked very unkempt and disheveled.Only he knew how he managed to live for the past three days.No one bothered him, but no one checked up on him either. It was like he had been completely forgotten.He seriously hated Gu Changge from the bottom of his heart, to the point of wanted to tear him to pieces with his bare hands.However, right now, Ye Chen was unbelievably shocked.That was because he just saw the person that he hated the most, who was also the person he least wanted to see.\u201cLord Gu. By your orders, Ye Chen had been kept imprisoned here.\u201dA disciple had lead the way.Gu Changge followed behind and leisurely walked in.\u201cGot it. You may leave.\u201d Gu Changge spoke coolly and nodded.Only after the disciple had left did he properly look Ye Chen over.He could see that Ye Chen did not have a good time during these three days imprisoned.In order to curry his favor, the Taixuan Holy land didn\u2019t give Ye Chen so much as a drop of water.For a Child of Fortune of all people to have turned to such a state. He truly was pitiful.Of course, Gu Changge didn\u2019t feel a hint of actual pity.After all, if Ye Chen had the ability required, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have let Gu Changge off.The first thing he\u2019d actually do would be to disperse Gu Changge\u2019s ashes.\u201cGu Changge, what are you here for?\u201d Ye Chen loudly yelled.He felt that Gu Changge did not come with good intentions.He even believed that Gu Changge was here to kill him.\u201cThe reason I came here was naturally to see you.\u201d\u201cOh, no, that\u2019s not right. Rather, I\u2019m here to see your master.\u201d Gu Changge casually smiled.He just blurted out Ye Chen\u2019s secret without any hesitance.\u201cW-what are you talking about? I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201dYe Chen\u2019s expression changed. His heart shook and he started to panic a little.How does Gu Changge know that he had a master?No one else besides himself knew this secret.At this moment, he felt a chill come over him.Before Gu Changge, he truly was just like an ant. He had no secrets before Gu Changge.\u201cStop acting. Who do you think that expression of yours is going to fool?\u201d Gu Changge sneered and continued on.\u201cDoes the senior plan to keep hiding? Holing yourself up like that really isn\u2019t the kind of demeanor suitable for a senior.\u201dAs Gu Changge spoke, his eyes were locked onto the ring on Ye Chen\u2019s finger.Ye Chen\u2019s heart completely sank at that.Not only did Gu Changge know of his master\u2019s existence, he even knew where his master was hidden.\u201cWhy must lord Gu trouble a mere soul remnant like me?\u201dAt this moment, a tired sigh finally rang out from Ye Chen\u2019s ring.The voice was heavenly, but it carried with it a certain amount of resignation.Right after, a scarlet light flashed before their eyes.A faded figure in red floated in midair.\u201cMaster?\u201dYe Chen\u2019s expressions changed. He never thought at his master would actually deliberately show herself.He felt a faint restlessness in his heart.\u201cOh, so that\u2019s what the senior looks like.\u201dGu Changge\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.He thought it would be an old grandpa, but who knew that it\u2019d be a beautiful teacher instead.Red clothes. Scarlet eyes. A supremely beautiful face.He humphed in his mind.This Ye Chen really does have some luck when it comes to the opposite sex.You\u2019re master really is beautiful, but she\u2019ll be mine soon.\u201cMight I ask what lord Gu has come here for? Yan Ji quietly asked.Her tone was cool. The fact that she showed herself was also due to having no other choice.Since Gu Changge had already discovered her existence, he\u2019d obviously have ways to force her to show herself too.Thus, why not simply show herself of her own will.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much really. Since I knew that there was someone great backing Ye Chen, I got a bit curious. I wanted to meet the person in question, that\u2019s all.\u201d Gu Changge replied naturally.At the very least, no one could see his thoughts from his face.Yan Ji and Ye Chen were no exceptions.After all, Ye Chen adamantly believed that Gu Changge came with nothing good in mind.His gaze was thick with hate and killing intent.Yan Ji couldn\u2019t figure out Gu Changge\u2019s real intentions either. All she could do was keep her guard up.\u201cWell the, lord Gu has now seen me right? I\u2019m just a woman, nothing particularly great.\u201d Yan Ji coolly replied.\u201cYou were able to teach an utter idiot like Ye Chen to this level. Is there any reason for senior to act so humble?\u201d\u201cDiamonds in the rough have appeared since ancient times. Those with the eyes can pick the wheat from the chaff. I simply did as I wished.\u201d\u201cFor senior to stay by Ye Chen, isn\u2019t it a waste of your talent?\u201d Gu Changge spoke casually with a sincere smile.He had tested it secretly. Just now, he put forth his intention to take the ring from Ye Chen by force, and the result was an instinctual sense of danger.He swore in his mind at the shittiness of the Fortune.However, he didn\u2019t show any abnormalities on the surface.\u201cGu Changge. Who are you calling an idiot\u2026\u201dThose words of his made Ye Chen mad to the point where he was turning green.To try to so unscrupulously steal away his master right in front of him like that.This Gu Changge truly was completely shameless!However, from another point of view, Ye Chen had panicked.All this time, his master had been what he relied on the most.If she really did abandon him, just what would happen?He didn\u2019t even dare to imagine it.Gu Changge\u2019s words had also startled Yan Ji.Although Ye Chen was indeed rather dumb at times, he did have other admirable qualities. For example, his perseverance, courage, tenaciousness, etc.Plus, she owed him for awakening her. There\u2019s no way that she could abandon him for just those few words.Just why did Gu Changge say such things?\u201cSowing discord?\u201dYan Ji twitched slightly before quickly realizing. This could very well be Gu Changge\u2019s real goal.However, even if she could see through such things, it doesn\u2019t mean Ye Chen could necessarily see it.In the end, she really did end up agreeing with Gu Changge\u2019s statement regarding Ye Chen\u2019s idiocy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not only did you steal my Qingge, but now you want to take away my Master...\"Ye Chen's face distorted in rage as he roared towards Gu Changge. He subconsciously believed that Gu Changge was trying to steal his Master from him! As for Gu Changge trying to sow discord between them? That didn't even cross his mind.Although he wouldn't say it, Ye Chen still held unspeakable emotions for Yan Ji. Although he treated her as his Master on normal days, in his heart, however, he regarded her as his exclusive property \u2014 someone he would never give to another person!So, now that Gu Changge tried to steal her away from him, his rage and hatred brewing towards him grew at an exponential speed; he was ready to burst at any time now.\"Eh? Why can't this Gu remember ever stealing your Qingge?\"Ye Chen's outburst didn't surprise Gu Changge. He didn't mind his words, and said with a playful tone, \"You do know that everything she did \u2014 from the beginning to the end \u2014 she did it of her own volition; not once did this Gu force or threaten Holy Maiden Qingge. What about that do you still not understand? Tell me, is what this Gu said not the truth?\"Water flows downhill, and man aims for a high status! That's the unchanging law of the world followed by all that dwell within it.\"Instead, if you really have your Master's best interest in your mind, then don't hold her back like this! Do you think a remnant spirit can live in this world forever?\"Every word hit the spot, arranged in way that would destroy the opponent's mind.Ye Chen tightly clenched his fists as his already-ugly expression worsened. He naturally understood that a remnant spirit couldn't survive for long in the world, so he had been working hard to get strong as fast as possible. He, too, couldn't wait to help his Master reconstruct her body!\"Little Chen, calm down...\"Yan Ji couldn't help but sigh as she invoked her Qi. Suddenly, a cool sensation spread through Ye Chen's mind and calmed him down.In the end, Ye Chen was still only a youth with a hot-headed temper. A few words from Gu Changge were enough to send his mind into chaos, preventing him from displaying his usual calm and steadfast temperament.Yan Ji couldn't understand why Ye Chen, who was normally quick-witted, would turn stupid every time he came across Gu Changge. Could it be that he couldn't jump back after suffering a minor setback like this?\"Master...\"Ye Chen gritted his teeth, and his irritable temper soon calmed down.Gu Changge's words just then could be described as vicious blades that drew blood with every thrust as they stabbed into his heart.[Ding! Ye Chen's mental state is further damaged. Ye Chen lost 20 Points of his Fortune. Host earned 100 Destiny Points.]A System prompt sounded in his mind, but Gu Changge couldn't be bothered about it right now.\"Senior, do consider what I am saying. If you follow me, not only can I help you recover your body, I can also make your prowess return to their peak!\"Senior must also know about this Gu's origins. Of all the people in this world, Senior should be the one most clear about the Power that stands behind me.\"And even if we ignore that and consider only our individual talent, this Gu is still far better than Ye Chen in every aspect...\"He kept on talking with a sincere attitude, as if he was earnestly trying to recruit a talented individual. As for Ye Chen? He was thoroughly ignored.By now, Yan Ji could no longer make sense of what this Gu Changge was trying to achieve; she couldn't help but frown.Instigating discord?With Gu Changge's strength, he could easily obliterate Ye Chen, so why would he need to bother with such a roundabout method? Maybe, she was thinking too much, and he truly just wanted to get her on his side.To be honest, she had quite a good impression of Gu Changge. After all, she had experienced far more than many others, so she didn't look at the world through a narrow and biased pin-hole.She had witnessed everything that happened, and in her view, Gu Changge had done and said nothing wrong. On the contrary, Ye Chen had held a confrontational attitude and even threatened to murder Gu Changge.Even then, Gu Changge didn't bother with him. The grandeur he held, his heroic might, and the calm temperament he showed...all that made Yan Ji believe that his achievements would be limitless in the future.\"Young Lord Gu, you needn't say anymore. Since I have received Little Chen's kindness, there's no way I will leave him alone before he has grown up.\"Still, Yan Ji shook her head and bluntly declined Gu Changge's kindness. Although the conditions were quite tempting, they couldn't make her go against her conscience.Her response visibly disappointed Gu Changge, and he said with a sigh, \"Of course, I won't press Senior to give me a response right now. You can take your time and consider my proposal. If Senior decides to follow me, I will forget about Ye Chen's hatred and offence towards me; asking the Taixuan Holy Land to release him without anymore punishment will also only take a sentence. As for Su Qingge, I can give her to him, too!\"\"You...\"Throbbing veins could be seen on Ye Chen's forehead, but he held back his rage. By now, Ye Chen had already understood that Gu Changge didn't just want to humiliate him, he wanted to steal everything that belonged to him.Although Ye Chen didn't say anything, the hatred and rage in his eyes had already grown as deep as a bottomless abyss.In Gu Changge's words, Su Qingge \u2014 who Ye Chen could only watch from afar \u2014 was nothing more than a doll whose fate could be decided with a single word from him. It opened Ye Chen's mind to the truth of the world once more: 'in a dog-eat-dog world like this, the strong could, indeed, do whatever they wanted!'\"Please don't speak anymore, Young Lord Gu! I appreciate your sincerity, but...\"Gu Changge's words had also startled Yan Ji. She had never thought he would propose something like that. It could be said that he was truly sincere with his request.\"Senior, do consider it! This Gu will never force anyone against their will, let alone threaten senior with Ye Chen's life.\"Gu Changge spoke once more with an indescribable look in his eyes. If he could really kill Ye Chen, he wouldn't have let him live this long.Although Yan Ji had lived far longer, her temperament was more straightforward, so she was far easier to deal with than Su Qingge. The small bias against him in her heart was stamped out with just those words.What's more? He had practiced for tonight's play for quite a while over the last three days.Gu Changge had already said everything he needed to say, and now, it was time for the final act of the play. After that, he would only need to watch the rift develop between these two Master and Disciple.And when they are none the wiser, he would reap all the benefits.\"This is called the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill]...though, I presume Senior already knows what it is.\"At this time, Gu Changge smiled and took out a box by moving his hands in an unhurried manner.Inside the box sat a lavender pill circled by small, colorful clouds. Various visions continuously emerged around the pill; there were mountains, oceans, and palaces full of grandeur that mysteriously appeared and disappeared.\"It's really the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill]!\"Yan Ji couldn't help but exclaim, and the shock in her delightful eyes couldn't be suppressed.\"Senior's spirit is not in a good state right now, so this pill can be considered the meeting gift from this Gu for you.\"Gu Changge said with a smile. Before Yan Ji could refuse the pill, he pushed the pill-box in her hands and disappeared from the prison.As the saying went: 'to harness a wolf, one must be willing to sacrifice their children.' [1]The smile on Gu Changge's face slowly faded away, only to be replaced by an expression of interest.---------------------[FOOTNOTES]It means you have to make sacrifices if you want to achieve something great.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He couldn't help but find Gu Changge to be even more terrifying and unfathomable than before.It was a good thing, though.After all, the more powerful his Young Lord grew, the higher his chance at completely taking over his family and leading them to greater glory.What he couldn't comprehend was why his Young Lord wouldn't kill Ye Chen even though he could see how much he desired to do so. With his Young Lord's strength of the Conferred Lord Realm at his age, only the descendants of other supreme Sects, Orthodoxies, and Clans could rival him even in the Upper Realm.For him, killing someone like Ye Chen, who was a nobody in the backwater Eastern Desolate, would need no more than a weak slap. So why did he bother himself with playing these games where he slowly took everything from that Ye Chen?\"Oh, what can't you understand?\"Gu Changge was in a joyous mood and decided to answer Old Ming's queries. Today, not only had he set up a rift between Ye Chen and his Master, but he had also raked in a ton of Fortune Points.Cutting leaks felt awesome, indeed!The day he finally stomped Ye Chen to death didn't look all that far now.\"This old slave can't understand why the Young Lord won't kill that Ye Chen directly? It would save you all this hassle.\"Old Ming put forward his doubts. After all, he couldn't see the presence of something as illusory as Fortune Value. To him, there was nothing about Ye Chen that would make him look like a Favored Son of Heaven.......If Gu Changge had to put it in the simplest terms, then it would be like this: 'Unless he exhausted all that cheat-like Fortune Value around Ye Chen, it would be impossible for him to kill him off. If he escaped with even a little of that Fortune Value, Ye Chen would be able to bounce back to the top one way or another, and contend against him in the future.'That's just how game-breaking the Fortune of these Favored Children of Heaven was. But, obviously, Gu Changge couldn't explain the above to Old Ming. Even if he did explain it, Old Ming wouldn't be able to comprehend the intricacies of the matter.......\"Ye Chen will die, but not right now. I still need him to give bring me a fortuitous encounter!\"Knowing that he couldn't explain the intricacies, Gu Changge decided to focus on shifting Old Ming's thoughts towards something he could comprehend with a smile full of intrigue.There wasn't much he needed to hide from this loyal old slave of his.From the memories of his Original, he could tell that the Original had descended to the Lower Realm because of a peerless Heavenly treasure that was about to appear in the world.\"[Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]!\"It's said to be a weapon used by the \"Eight Desolate Demon God\" during the Primordial Era. With vast murderous intent and never-ending reserves of power, the Eight Desolate Demon God is said to have almost slaughtered his way to Heaven.Later, for reasons unknown, disappeared down the long river of time.Gu Changge's original had a Devil Heart which he inherited from a terrifying, ruthless being in the Upper Realm. The news of the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] was recorded in the heritage he received, and it said that it was very likely to be somewhere in the Lower Realm.It was because of this reason that the Original had used the excuse of gaining experience, and descended to the Lower Realm.On the surface, his trip to the Lower Realm was simply a tour to increase his life experience, but in reality, he had descended to look for the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]!Of course, judging from his place in the story as a cannon fodder mob villain, there's no way he would get his hands on anything as nice as that mighty Halberd.If Gu Changge's guess wasn't too far off from reality, then the plot will further progress like this: 'Ye Chen will find himself in a desperate situation and escape into some ruins out of sheer coincidence. Down there, he will receive the approval of the Death Guards, and make great progress in his cultivation. After that, he will get the approval of the Halberd, too, and turn around the situation!'If Gu Changge didn't place his cards correctly, then he might just lose his life here in the Lower Realm. Or it was also possible that he would escape back to the Upper Realm \u2014 on the verge of death, of course \u2014 and forge a life and death enmity with this Ye Chen.......There was no one more familiar with Gu Changge when it came to such plot progression; he was like a God with an omnipotent perspective as he calculated everything that might happen in the future. And once he analyzed all the possibilities, it was basically impossible for him to come out the loser at the end.Sure enough, reading all those web novels back in the day wasn't a waste, at all. This dog author wouldn't be able to trick him to his death.\"Turns out the Young Lord has already made arrangements!\"Old Ming couldn't help but admire Gu Changge even more after he heard his explanation and considerations. His Young Lord was indeed worthy of his title of God-Child!\"Keep a close eye on Ye Chen, and pay attention to his whereabouts at all times. I expect some trouble to come knocking at the Taixuan Holy Land any time now.\"Gu Changge commanded Old Ming with a strange light flashing through his eyes.They had imprisoned the Favored Son of Heaven in destitute conditions for three days, so there should definitely be something bad coming the Taixuan Holy Land's way, right? Fortune Backlash, or whatever, should be taking effect any time now.What would it be, though?That's what Gu Changge wanted to know.......[Inside the Dungeon.]\"This is really the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill]...\"Yan Ji murmured to herself.Her scarlet pupils couldn't hide the shock in them as she looked down at the pill wrapped in lavender Qi. There was no way she could misrecognize this pill, and it was because of this that she was truly shocked.One had to accept that Gu Changge was indeed generous with his meeting gift.She was never short of this pill when she was at the peak of her power, but now, Gu Changge giving her this pill was no different from someone sending you charcoal on a snowy winter night.[1]Even in the Upper Realm, the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill] is an extremely precious treasure. It's refining process is troublesome beyond measure, and the materials are difficult to come across. One had to know that even in the Upper Realm, one would rarely find this Pill only in some massive auction houses.As for refining an [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill] in the destitute Lower Realm? That was an impossible task.The Pill's powerful effect of rebuilding and stabilizing spirits made many mighty figures salivate for it. Because, in some situations, having an [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill] could spell the difference between life and death.No matter how mighty a person might be, they would always have some [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pills] on their person for desperate situtations.\"Master, what exactly is this pill...\"Ye Chen's complexion couldn't help but change, and a bad premonition rose in his heart as he watched Yan Ji silently stare at the pill.Was that pill really so precious?Gu Changge was indeed a sly bastard!Not only did he mess with his Master's mind using flowery words, but he also used a precious pill to seduce his Master.He had to slaughter that bastard!Yan Ji had a complicated expression as she explained the pill's rarity and prowess to Ye Chen.Ye Chen couldn't help but clench his fists and grit his teeth in silent as he listened about the wonders of the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill].The [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill] could be said to have more than just powerful effects...it could be called a Heavenly Panacea, and that wouldn't be too much of an overstatement!What's more? It could help Yan Ji stabilize her current state and give her enough power to repair her remnant spirit!\"Master, are you really going to use this pill?\"Ye Chen's eyes reddened, and he asked through gritted teeth with a hoarse voice. He couldn't stand such humiliation! It felt as if he was a beggar and Gu Changge had given him some alms.But it was indeed a fact that this pill could help his Master suffer less from her crumbling remnant spirit.He was trapped in a dilemma.It could be said that he was trapped in a situation where he would be the loser no matter what option he chose.'Gu Changge! Good, good, good! You are indeed a crafty bastard!''I will kill you for sure!''I MUST SLAUGHTER YOU!'Ye Chen couldn't help but scream in his heart.\"After all, it's Young Lord Gu's kindness, so...\"Before she could finish her words, Yan Ji saw Ye Chen's ugly expression and knew what was wrong.\"Little Chen, be honest with me: are you biased against Young Lord Gu?\"Ye Chen's eyes widened in disbelief as those words fell into his ears. He vision darkened and the world around him collapsed into rubble.----------------------[FOOTNOTES]It means to help someone in their worst times.

But she guessed that it might be related to that woman named Su Qingge.No matter how one looked at the two, Gu Changge was indeed far better than Ye Chen.Jealousy was the worst of sins.In the end, Ye Chen was just too young. He hadn't even grown up into an adult yet, he was just a teenager. His mind was completely immature, and he only knew how to act on his hot-headed tendencies.\"Little Chen, you don't need to envy Young Lord Gu; I believe your future achievements won't be any lower than his...\"Yan Ji persuaded softly, trying her best to resolve the grudge between the two.After all, if Gu Changge had really wanted to kill Ye Chen, he wouldn't have waited until now. Of course, she didn't know of Ye Chen's status as a Favored Son of Heaven.If not for that dog-shit Fortune protecting Ye Chen in secret, Gu Changge would never need to act the way he did and orchestrate such a show before he slapped Ye Chen to death.\"Young Lord Gu this, YOUNG LORD GU THAT! If you like him so much, why don't you go to his side then...*\"Why take pity on me and stay here?\"Ye Chen couldn't help but loudly interrupt Yan Ji through gritted teeth. His eyes had already reddened, and he resembled a wounded beast.Su Qingge had already abandoned him, and now, even his Master, who was the only one he had left, was thinking well of his enemy!Ye Chen couldn't stand this. His hatred and madness were through the roof.If he was an ordinary person, he would have already spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted on the spot. It was only because of Ye Chen's tempered mind that far exceeded normal humans that he could take such a heavy blow without going insane!His sudden growl stunned Yan Ji. She couldn't help but lower her eyes as disappointment clouded her gorgeous, scarlet pupils.She had never expected such words from Ye Chen.Such behavior could no longer be explained by jealousy. He was a complete simpleton.Hadn't he seen how she had rejected Gu Changge even after he did his best in trying to invite her over to his side?Did Ye Chen truly not understand what kind of person she was?Yan Ji couldn't help but sigh in heart as a breath full of regret escaped through her lips. How good would it have been if the one who helped her awaken was not Ye Chen, but Young Lord Gu?\"Little Chen, I am definitely going to consume this pill, no matter what you say! Even if Gu Changge has other plans, he probably never thought that I would help you escape from the dungeon.\"Yan Ji continued. It's just that her voice was less soft, and more cold and majestic.Consuming the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill] could not only ease her current state, but it could also stabilize her spirit and allow her to exert some of her strength.'Help me escape?''Is that what Master wanted to do?'Ye Chen thought to himself and didn't utter another word. His mind was in a mess, and he needed to calm down.Still, he could feel deep down in his heart that he had lost something very important to him. It's just that he couldn't put his finger on what that might be.......[Ding! You have successfully created a rift between Ye Chen and his Master! Ye Chen lost 80 Points of his Fortune Value. You received 400 Destiny Points!]Gu Changge couldn't help but smile as he listened to the melodious System prompt.His mood couldn't be more wonderful.Everything had followed the path he paved, and in just a few days, Ye Chen's more than 500 Points of Fortune Value had fallen by half.Although Ye Chen was still a head above ordinary people, and it would be hard for others to ever match him, this was definitely the greatest loss he suffered in his entire life.His heroine surrendered to the villain, and a crack also appeared in his Master's heart...It seems that this Favored Son of Heaven won't be able to prance around in front of him for long.Afterwards, Gu Changge opened his own Attributes Panel.In any case, his real purpose behind dealing with Ye Chen is to cut that leek, shave off his Fortune, and improve his personal strength.He couldn't let his momentary success blind him.With just a thought, the Attributes Panel appeared.------Host: Gu ChanggeIdentity: True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao PalaceBloodline: Devil Heart, Dao BoneCultivation: Conferred Lord (Early Stage)Mystical Abilities: Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex (7th Layer), Myriad Changes Demonic Physique (Talent), Immortal-Devouring Demon Art...Destiny Points: 1100Fortune Value: 50 (Dark)System Shop: OpenedWarehouse: Domain-Traversing Talisman x1, One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x1------\"From my previous experience, I doubt that a thousand or so Destiny Points will be able to help me break through to the 8th Layer of the [Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex]. At most, it can increase my comprehension of the 7th Layer to some extent...\"This [Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex] must be quite a high-leveled technique, so I won't need to worry about upgrading to a better one for now.\"As for this Immortal Devouring Art...it's something I can't use in front of other Immortals. I have to be careful when I use the secret techniques learned from it.\"After all, a Mystical Ability that lets you swallow Immortals is really going against the Heavens. Once exposed, I will end up as an enemy of the entire world!\"Gu Changge analyzed, and then opened the System Shop.After having gone through the Original's memory, these Mystical Abilities were truly befitting of someone who was meant to die as a cannon fodder villain who only received a future chapters worth of existence.Even in the Upper Realms, this [Immortal-Devouring Demon Art] was considered a forbidden technique that could easily discolor the faces of many, and was associated with many ancient horrors.It had long been buried in the long river of time, and no one dared to mention it. Calling it a Taboo Inheritance wouldn't be an overstatement.\"It seems that I am really fated to walk further and further down the road of villainy...\"Gu Changge quickly shifted his attention to the items in the System Shop.It was similar to what he had expected, and it was divided into different categories.[Mystical Martial Arts], [Mystical Bloodlines], and [Auxiliary Items].Gu Changge first opened the [Mystical Martial Arts] section and looked at the stuff available for purchase.Heaven, Deity, Holy, and Supreme Ranked techniques...\"Since I don't have enough Destiny Points, I can't access the Supreme Ranked techniques?\"What's more, nothing below Heaven Ranked is included here?\"Also, aren't Heaven Ranked techniques a bit too cheap? They can let a cultivator directly cultivate to the False God Realm, yet they only cost 50 Destiny Points?\"Or is it because the Destiny Points have great purchasing power in the System Shop?\"Sacred Sun Heavenly Manual. Gather the power of the sacred Sun...\"\"Sacred Yin Heavenly Manual. Gather the power of the sacred Yin...\"Gu Changge was surprised the diversity of the options.It wasn't an overstatement to say that a single Heaven Ranked technique could set off a bloody storm in the Eastern Desolate!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayInnate God's Spirit Temple; Attack of the Sacred Lands!Gu Changge wasn't in need of the techniques under the [Mystical Martial Arts] section right now, so his attention quickly turned to the [Mystical Talents] section.[VILFIC: Mystical Bloodlines will be Mystical Talents from henceforth. It has been updated in the previous chapter.]The so-called [Mystical Talents] were powerful blessings people were born with.Some people would be born with strong bloodlines and inherit great might from their ancient ancestors. Some people would be born with powerful physiques that could exert unrivaled might. So on and so forth...In short, all kinds of bloodlines, talents, and physiques existed, and it was hard for all of them to be named in a single encyclopedia.The only constant about them was the fact that people were innately born with their talent, whatever it might be. But the System easily broke that constant as you could easily exchange for a talent, bloodline, or physique using the Destiny Points even if you weren't born with one.Gu Changge scanned through the available options one by one.His current talent was already terrifying enough. His Devil Heart was an innate talent that could let other talents exist in his body without conflict. If someone else tried to merge with another talent, then the stronger talent will easily exterminate the weaker one. Or there could also be unpredictable risks if the two talents couldn't merge or devour the other.Gu Changge, however, didn't need to worry about such risks. Or how else would he have obtained the Dao Bone?Dao Bone was also an extremely terrifying innate talent. Dao Bones came to existence when a person was born and natural Dao runes branded themselves on one of their bone.As long as a possessor of a Dao Bone didn't get killed in the cradle, they would be destined to reach great heights and become supreme behemoths in the future. After all, the Dao is above all, and Heaven is its backer, so you just gotta ride on its coattails to reach Immortality.Still, nothing in the world could satisfy human greed.Gu Changge looked through the System Shop and found his own talents in there, too.Soon, his eyes lit up.[Innate God's Spirit Temple]Gu Changge slowly enunciated these words.The name was enough for him to see that this talent was related to the cultivation of the soul. The soul's form and limits were set in stone at the moment of birth, and those born with some talent related to the soul would be extremely terrifying and possess incredible abilities.Saying that someone with a stronger soul would be a cut above their peers, and that few could compare to them, wouldn't be an overstatement.Gu Changge hadn't heard of anyone with such a talent in the Upper Realm.The soul was an illusory and unfathomable matter.The techniques used to strengthen the soul were few and far in-between, and all of them were tightly hidden and guarded by a few supreme, reclusive powers in the Upper Realm.Gu Changge naturally didn't have such a powerful talent either.\"[Immortal-Devouring Demon Art] can swallow the Origin of Immortals, and even their Primordial Spirits, so it must be very beneficial to this [Innate God's Spirit Temple], and might even enhance it's effects to another level...\"\"It's quite expensive, however. I can get some Holy Ranked Techniques for this amount...\"\"A thousand Destiny Points! Still, it won't be a loss, if I must say!\"Gu Changge didn't feel distressed over the price after thinking about the potential gains. Without hesitation, he exchanged a thousand Destiny Points for the [Innate God's Spirit Temple].A breath of fresh air rejuvenated Gu Changge's spirits.[Rumble!]Gu Changge heard a terrifying rumble in the depths of his Sea of Consciousness. Even the air around him moved chaotically, as if responding to the changes happening in his body.Inside his Sea of Consciousness, Gu Changge could hear various supreme Taoist chants as various golden lotuses bloomed, surrounded by mysterious ruins and inexplicable Immortal Qi. It was as if a world was opening up in his Sea of Consciousness.Soon, a magnificent and awe-inspiring structure dark structure rose from below in his Sea of Consciousness. It was a pitch-black, cold temple that stood untouched by anything around it. Inside the temple sat an ancient-looking evil silhouette with an indifferent and profound expression. A terrifying spirit energy rumbled around it as he seemed to be overlooking everything that existed under the Heavens.\"So this is the [Innate God's Spirit Temple]! The power of my soul has increased by a hundredfold already...\"Gu Changge couldn't help but chuckle.Becoming stronger and having everything under control brought along a wonderful feeling. No wonder there were countless people pursuing supreme powers in this world, and those other worlds of fiction.It was a fascinating feeling, after all.......Another three days passed in the blink of an eye.[A few thousand miles away from the Taixuan Holy Land.][Hum!]Streams of rainbows appeared in the sky as many mighty figures joined each other from different directions.Some were traveling on flying boats, others were riding atop fierce beasts, and some flew without any support...the only thing common among them, though, was the fact that they all radiated fierce and extremely powerful auras.A lot of powerful forces from all over the Eastern Desolate were heading towards the Taixuan Holy Land at their maximum speed. There were other Sacred Lands that had millenniums of heritage, Cultivation Dynasties, Ancient Families, Sects, etc. All of them lorded over massive swats of land in the Eastern Desolate.\"Could the news be wrong?\"An old man resting atop a mountain peak asked. He wore spotless white robes that fluttered in the wind, his lustrous skin reflected the sunlight, and he looked like an immortal as he focused his detached gaze towards the Taixuan Holy Land that stood in the distance.The Taixuan Holy Land spanned across endless stretches of mountains, with its many divine islands floating in the air. One could see a spiritual mist shrouding the Taixuan Holy Land's premises as the visions of auspicious beasts soaring in the air and diving towards the earth inspired awe in the hearts of the onlookers.Behind the visions and veils of mist stood a land of pure holiness.The old man's burning eyes had long turned green with greed as he watched the Taixuan Holy Land with the eyes of a wolf staring at his prey.If his Void Yang Holy Land could swallow the Taixuan Holy Land, then they would definitely be crowned the strongest force in all of the Eastern Desolate!\"Reporting to the Supreme Elder! The news is indeed correct!\"\"When the Taixuan Holy Land held the ceremony to coronate their new Holy Son, one of our spies sneaked to the place where the Supreme Elder of the Taixuan Holy Land secluded himself, and the spy found that the Taixuan Supreme Elder's breath had disappeared from that place...\"\"We suspect that he has already died in the midst of his seclusion...\"An Elder of the Void Yang Holy Land standing behind the white-robed Supreme Elder respectfully reported.\"Good, good, good! I have brought along all the old monsters today, so we can use this opportunity to obliterate the Taixuan Holy Land while we are here.\"The white-robed old man stroked his beard with a smile. Joy filled his heart as he imagined the future.The Taixuan Holy Land, with a millenniums-old deep heritage, will soon be exterminated from the Eastern Desolate for good.\"However, Supreme Elder, we have received reports that the Taixuan Holy Land recently got close to some mysterious youth. That unknown youth seems to have quite a terrifying background from what I have heard...\"At this time, another Elder stepped forward and informed the Void Yang Supreme Elder.\"I already know about that matter...he's just a young man, what great background could he have? No matter how mighty his background is, he won't be able to change today's outcome. You do know that we aren't the only ones keeping an eye on the Taixuan Holy Land, right...\"\"What's more? I heard that the kid my granddaughter's so infatuated with is also imprisoned by the Taixuan Holy Land in their dungeon...\"\"These Taixuan Holy Land bastards are truly blind to not see such a talented youth right under their noses...\"The white-robed old man smiled with a deep look in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From the way those forces flaunted their might, it was clear that they had all gathered to attack their Taixuan Holy Land!Even though the Taixuan Holy Land claimed to be the strongest in the Eastern Desolate on usual days, even they couldn\u2019t help but tremble if so many behemoths turned their spearheads towards them.However, the disciple couldn\u2019t help contain his shock after he made his report. Be it the Holy Lord or the Elders, none of them showed any panic or change in their expressions even after listening to his words.All of them looked calm as if nothing big had happened!\u201cThat\u2019s it?

You had already expected something like this, and that\u2019s why you already formed a good relationship with Young Lord Gu!\u201dAt the same time, the other Elders smiled and started to flatter the Taixuan Holy Lord for his great foresight and ability. Although the Taixuan Holy Lord knew the Elders were only bragging and didn\u2019t really admire him as much as they showed on their faces, he still couldn\u2019t help but feel proud of himself.However, he still had to keep appearances and couldn\u2019t just put down the majesty of the Taixuan Holy Lord, so he majestically waved his hand and said in a light tone, \u201cOur Taixuan Holy Land has been in a state of anxiety ever since our Supreme Elder passed away in the midst of his seclusion, and it\u2019s all thanks to Young Lord Gu coming down to the Lower Realm for life experience that we could have a chance of having a favorable relationship with him. Instead of flattering me, all of you should thank Young Lord Gu for his grace!\u201dTaixuan Holy Lord couldn\u2019t help but feel pride as he said all those words. After all, Gu Changge was a genuine Young Lord from the Upper Realm, with a strong identity and a terrifying background.Except for the Elders and some of the trustworthy Inner Sect Disciples, no one else in the Taixuan Holy Land knew about this matter. It was because the Taixuan Holy Lord wanted to give a massive surprise to the various major forces.One had to accept that Taixuan Holy Lord was also a person of great intellect. He had long expected such a situation\u2019s appearance.\u201cHoly Lord, it seems that Her Royal Highness and Young Lord Gu have been getting closer and closer over the last few days. I am afraid that if we didn\u2019t have the Holy Maiden, our Taixuan Holy Land might have to face an unavoidable catastrophe this time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right! It\u2019s all thanks to the Holy Lord having a good daughter!\u201dAll the Elders flatter with sighs of envy, and their actions only widened the Taixuan Holy Lord\u2019s smile.That\u2019s right! It was all thanks to his precious daughter, or else, how would nobodies like them have a chance to interact with someone as esteemed as Young Lord Gu?As for the disciple who came to make the report? His poor mind couldn\u2019t help but collapse out of stupefaction as he listened to the conversation between the Elders and the Taixuan Holy Lord.The Taixuan Supreme Elder has already died?Is that mysterious Young Lord truly powerful beyond measure?The disciple\u2019s head buzzed as he watched the Elders and the Taixuan Holy Lord converse among themselves joyfully. There wasn\u2019t the least bit of panic between their brows.\u201cOpen the gates and follow me! Let\u2019s go meet those factions that have come to our doorstep\u2026\u201dGolden rays flashed past the Taixuan Holy Lord\u2019s pupils as his aura surged and he boldly walked out to meet his adversaries.\u2026\u2026[In a pavilion of the Taixuan Holy Land.]\u201cYoung Master Gu\u2019s words are really interesting; is the Upper Realm really that massive?\u201dSu Qingge pursed her lips and asked.At the same time, she gently rolled back her cuffs to reveal a small section of her delicate and flawless wrists, that resembled the roots of a snow lotus, to fill Gu Changge\u2019s empty glass of tea sitting in front of her.The stories about the Upper Realm that came out of Gu Changge\u2019s mouth fascinated Su Qingge.After she let go the prejudice in her heart and contacted Gu Changge once more, she found that the feeling of being in his company was completely different from before. Although Gu Changge\u2019s had an extremely deep and elusive temperament, she couldn\u2019t help but be attracted to him \u2014 that\u2019s just how much undeniable charm he held towards the members of the opposite sex.As the Holy Maiden of the Taixuan Holy Land, and someone who also held two souls in her body, Su Qingge had been hailed as an intellectual prodigy since young. Throughout the years, she had met many young talents, but none of them could compare to Gu Changge, if she were to be honest.To put it simply, she thought it would be an insult to Gu Changge if those\u00a0\u2018talents\u2019\u00a0were to be compared to him. With his handsome appearance, elusive thoughts, and majestic temperament\u2026not many could compare to him!Not to mention Gu Changge had a great depth of knowledge, tolerance, conversation skills, cultivation base, and background, etc.Even her father said that he might not be Gu Changge\u2019s opponent.No matter how one looked at Gu Changge, he was the perfect dream husband desired by many women in the world. And Su Qingge was naturally not an exception.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but smile a little as he heard Su Qingge\u2019s question.\u201cWhy not go up and see for yourself how massive the Upper Realm is?\u201dThey had been getting closer and closer over the last few days, to the point that Su Qingge had almost opened up to him, but Gu Changge couldn\u2019t comprehend why his Fortune Value still hadn\u2019t increased.He had already concluded that Su Qingge\u2019s luck had nothing to with Ye Chen.So, was she also a Favored Child of Heaven?Or was it because her mother came from the Upper Realm, so she had inherited some extraordinary bloodline?Or could she be the reincarnation of an ancient behemoth?Even the System couldn\u2019t explain her existence.\u2018It seems the world doesn\u2019t lack people blessed with great Fortune who are completely different from the Favored Children of Heaven like that Ye Chen.\u2019Gu Changge thought.At the same time, Gu Changge guessed that he could still use Su Qingge to get some more dough from that leek called Ye Chen, since Ye Chen had still not given up on Su Qingge.\u201cOnly someone in the False God Realm can break the barrier between the worlds and ascend! How can ordinary cultivators from the Lower Realm like us go to the Upper Realm so easily?\u201dSu Qingge replied with regret.After all, powerhouses of the False God Realm represented the absolute pinnacle of the Lower Realm. Not to mention in the Eastern Desolate, you wouldn\u2019t even see them in the Northern, Western, or other Desolates and places in the Lower Realm.Even the Supreme Elder of their Taixuan Holy Land was merely half a step into the False God Realm, yet he had already died in the midst of his seclusion.Right now, the strongest in the Sacred Lands of the Eastern Desolate was probably only half a step into the Conferred Lord Realm.As for how hard it was to reach a point where one could break through the barrier and ascend, Su Qingge couldn\u2019t comprehend.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When you reach the Upper Realm, you will realize that the False God Realm is nothing much\u2026\u201dGu Changge replied casually. In his words, the False God Realm realm was nothing much, as if cultivators of that level could be found on the streets like cabbage.Still, those weren\u2019t empty words.Although the cultivators of the False God Realm were mighty existences in the Lower Realm, they were a dime a dozen over in the Upper Realm. With a lifespan over ten thousand years, False God Realm cultivators made up the majority of disciples in the Immortal Sects, Orthodoxies, and Clans in the Upper Realm.\u201cI wonder if Young Lord Gu can tell Qingge about the Realms beyond the False God Ream?\u201dSu Qingge asked with bright eyes, showing her interest in the topic.Just what kind of beings were those beyond the False God Realm?\u201cWhat\u2019s there to tell about that? Beyond the False Gods are obviously the True Gods,\u201d Gu Changge replied and took a sip of his wine.Although Su Qingge received a perfunctory reply, she wasn\u2019t discouraged. Quietly filling Gu Changge\u2019s cup, she hesitated for a moment, and then moved. A faint, alluring fragrance diffused in the surroundings as Su Qingge appeared behind Gu Changge.\u201cYoung Lord, is this strength to your liking?\u201dSu Qingge asked as she began to massage Gu Changge\u2019s shoulders, just like an obedient maid. Although her technique wasn\u2019t well-practiced, there was a certain charm to her movements.[Hoh?]Su Qingge\u2019s sudden actions surprised Gu Changge. Her current behavior was completely inconsistent with her identity as a heroine who was supposed to have a detached temperament.\u201cQingge knows that it\u2019s difficult for me to receive Young Lord\u2019s love, but Qingge doesn\u2019t want to give up\u2026\u201dSu Qingge answered with honesty. If someone by the side were to hear her words at this moment, they would think that she was one of those straightforward women who proactively chased after the one they loved.But the truth was that she was a clever one, and everything she did in front of Gu Changge was calculated by her.Still, Gu Changge had to admit that he wasn\u2019t repulsed by Su Qingge\u2019s antics. He could naturally tell the reasoning behind Su Qingge\u2019s actions.Su Qingge was a smart woman who wouldn\u2019t be willing to be an ornamental vase wife. She had her own ambitions, and if he had to be honest, then Gu Changge truly appreciated women like her.It\u2019s just that Su Qingge had still not reached the point where he would be fascinated by her. He wouldn\u2019t be tempted so easily. There was no way he would ruin himself over a moment of pleasure.As these thoughts crossed through Gu Changge\u2019s mind, he realized that the relationship between Su Qingge and Ye Chen had somehow shattered beyond salvation.The feeling of danger he felt over the last few days had vanished.In other words, he would only suffer a Fortune Backlash if he targeted the Favored Children of Heaven and people who were very close to them.Although Su Qingge had great Fortune around her \u2014 at least ten times higher than ordinary people \u2014 Gu Changge felt that he could take her down right here and now without suffering any backlash.\u2018So, having a great amount of Fortune around you doesn\u2019t mean that you are a Favored Child of Heaven who will be protected by the Heavens?\u2019\u2018That\u2019s more reasonable. After all, there can only be so many Favored Children of Heaven, and all of them should be cookie-cutter protagonists\u2026\u2019Gu Changge thought to himself, deepening his understanding of the world around him.\u201cBeyond the False God Realm is naturally the True God Realm. Existences in this Realm ignite their sacred flame and forge a divine foundation\u2026\u201d\u201cBeyond the True Gods are the Heavenly Gods! They stand high above all existences, and even the True Gods can only look up to them\u2026\u201dWith his mood brightened, Gu Changge decided to explain a thing or two to Su Qingge.\u201cThank you for teaching all this to Qingge, Young Lord!\u201d\u201cThe Realms beyond the False God Realm are like this: True God, Heavenly God, Godking, Sage\u2026\u201d[VILFIC: don\u2019t think too much into these True God and Heavenly God Realms. They aren\u2019t set in stone at this point, and might change to something else as more information is revealed in the future.]Su Qingge was joyous as she listened, but then, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit dejected as reality hit her.After all, she was only in the Transcendent Realm right now, and it was unknown how long it would take her to reach the False God Realm, let alone the mythical realms beyond that.It would be a miracle if she could touch those realms in this lifetime.\u201cQingge will work hard to please Young Lord in the future!\u201dSu Qingge thought for a while and then said with great resolve. Her gem-like, beautiful eyes shone as she looked at Gu Changge with a deep gaze and spoke without a hint of awkwardness.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but smirk as he said, \u201cWell, do your best.\u201dDamn, this was awesome, no?The heroine fell so fast, so didn\u2019t that mean his villainous charm was through the roof?Gu Changge didn\u2019t think so. Su Qingge simply made the most reasonable and correct choice.Right then, Old Ming\u2019s voice transmission sounded in Gu Changge\u2019s ears.\u2018Interesting! It\u2019s almost the same as what I expected.\u2019Gu Changge\u2019s smile changed and a mysterious expression appeared on his face.The various major and minor forces of the Eastern Wilderness had banded together against the Taixuan Holy Land, and come knocking at their door. Ye Chen took this opportunity to escape from the dungeon in the confusion. And, of course, it was all thanks to the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill] gifted to his Master by Gu Changge.Everything was going according to his plans.Gu Changge stood up and left the pavilion. Of course, he didn\u2019t tell Su Qingge that Ye Chen had fled from confinement.Su Qingge could only look at Gu Changge\u2019s back as he suddenly stood up and left her behind.She wondered if she somehow offended him again?Ah! Could a King only be accompanied by a Tiger?[VILFIC: She\u2019s wondering if she\u2019s not worthy enough to be with him.]Su Qingge helplessly stood at her spot and thought about everything she did and said, trying to figure out which word or action from her could have offended Gu Changge.\u2026\u2026[Outside the Taixuan Holy Land at this time.]The magnificent warships, flying boats, and fierce beasts of the major forces hovered in the air and poured a surging aura towards the Taixuan Holy Land. Their shadows fell upon the land below, masking the sun and the sky.Auras of mighty cultivators surged towards the Heaven, and terrifying beasts roared towards their prey as their decimating howls reverberated in the surroundings.The Void Yang Holy Land, the Great Sun Dynasty, the Ancient Xiao Family\u2026These were a few of the behemoths of the Eastern Wilderness with millenniums-old heritage backing them up.As soon as they heard that the strongest existence in the Taixuan Holy Land had perished, they gathered together like sharks that had smelled blood and prepared themselves to swallow the juicy prey in front of them.But right now, all of the people who had come to devour the Taixuan Holy Land had confusion painting their faces, including the Supreme Elder of the Void Yang Holy Land.The Supreme Elder couldn\u2019t help but frown as he watched the unguarded gate of the Taixuan Holy Land.\u201cHave the people of the Taixuan Holy Land accepted their powerlessness and opened their gates for us? How come there\u2019s no guard or protection array? Did their Great Protection Array run out of steam?\u201dAn old man dressed as an emperor of one of the great Dynasties asked. He wore purple dragon robes and a golden and purple crown on his head. His voice reverberated in the surroundings like a knell, spreading forth a terrible and suffocating aura.At this time, a group of Elders and Disciples of the Taixuan Holy Land slowly walked out and arrived before all the\u00a0\u2018guests.\u2019\u201cEveryone, have you come to pay your respects to Young Lord Gu?\u201dThe Taixuan Holy Lord asked aloud with a faint, teasing smile on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhao Tian from the Void Yang Holy Land, Chu Wuji from the Great Sun Dynasty, and Xiao Huo from the Ancient Xiao Family, right?\u201d\u201cTo think the three half-step Conferred Lords would gather together to pay their respects to Young Lord Gu. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think you will be given the chance if you don\u2019t show any sincerity!\u201dTaixuan Holy Lord appeared in the sky with his hands behind his back, and enunciated each word without hurry. A teasing smirk adorned his visage as his voice thundered in the surroundings.A group of Elders and Disciples stood behind him without a shred of panic on their faces. All of them had calm expressions and disdainful smirks as they watched their\u00a0\u2018guests.\u2019\u00a0After all, they had hugged the thigh of their all-powerful Young Lord.All of the major forces of the Eastern Wilderness in front of them were nothing more than stray mutts who could only bark and never bite.Didn\u2019t the ancients have a saying:\u00a0\u2018When a man ascends to Heaven, his pets follow, too!\u2019All of the Disciples and Elders who knew Gu Changge\u2019s true identity felt as if they would fly to Heaven in the next moment.As for the major powers of the Eastern Wilderness? They were nothing more than a fart now. Young Lord Gu would only need a slap to shatter them.And if they dared to provoke Young Lord Gu? The Disciples and Elders believed that a single fart from the person behind Young Lord Gu would be enough to eradicate them back to their Sects, Clans, and Dynasties.With their confidence inflated to such a point, how could the Disciples and Elders of the Taixuan Holy Land feel any fear?\u201cWhat?\u201dThe white-robed Supreme Elder, the Emperor of the Great Sun Dynasty, and everyone else who came along with them felt their heads buzz. All the cultivators on the ancient warships, flying boats, and fierce beasts were stunned by the display of fearlessness and arrogance from their prey.They had arrived at the Taixuan Holy Land\u2019s door with great momentum, expecting them to submit without a shred of resistance, yet the response they received was completely different from their imagination.\u201cTaixuan Holy Lord, what do you mean?\u201dMany of them couldn\u2019t even contain their shock. The catastrophe had come knocking at their door, yet the Disciples and Elders held absolute confidence and disdainful smirks.Just what was going on?Had everyone in the Taixuan Holy Land lost their mind?Or did they really have something to back their confidence?\u2018Pay our respects to Young Lord Gu? Who is that? Is he the youth whose thighs the Taixuan Holy Land recently latched on to?\u2019\u2018Or is the Taixuan Holy Lord just paying tricks to scare us?\u2019The old man named Zhao Tian, the Supreme Elder of the Void Yang Holy Land, couldn\u2019t help but think about the matter in his heart.He was an old monster who had lived for thousands of years, so he could see the abnormality that others couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t want to. The entire Taixuan Holy Land was too calm. He wanted to know who gave them such confidence?One had to understand that even if the Taixuan Supreme Elder was alive, and his cultivation had progressed further, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to stop all of them if they gathered together to deal with the Taixuan Holy Land like today.[VILFIC: there\u2019s a mistake in the previous chapters where it mentioned that the Taixuan Supreme Elder was a half-step False God. He was half-step Conferred Lord.]The atmosphere outside the Taixuan Holy Land was quite peculiar at this time, as both sides stood in a stalemate.\u201cHuh, what\u2019s this Young Lord Gu? Who\u2019s he?\u201d\u201cHe sounds to be some youth; is he some heir of some hidden old monster who has come out to experience the world? Still, what can he do even if that\u2019s the case?\u201d\u201cThis old man brought along the Imperial Weapon of my Dynasty, and it\u2019s at full power right now. Even a Conferred King will be suppressed under it!\u201dThe Emperor of the Great Sun Dynasty coldly replied to Taixuan Holy Lord\u2019s words. As soon as he spoke up, his words full of a terrifying aura resounded everywhere in the surroundings.His Great Sun Dynasty and the Taixuan Holy Land had a great feud to settle, and today was his best opportunity to obliterate the Taixuan Holy Land, so how could he let someone butt in at this point in time?\u201cWe showed you a path to survival, yet you barge onto the path to death! Don\u2019t complain to us when you are dying.\u201d\u201cYou lot can\u2019t even imagine the esteemed identity of our Young Lord Gu!\u201d\u201cAn ant want to get a glimpse of Heaven? What wishful thinking!\u201dUpon hearing their words, the Taixuan Holy Land replied with an arrogant tone. Still holding his hands behind his back, he showed a smirk.He was also a bigshot in the Eastern Wilderness, so how could he let go of such a great opportunity to posture before these bastards?Once they frightened all of these major forces of the Eastern Wilderness today, then the entirety of the Eastern Wilderness will have to show respect to their Taixuan Holy Land in the future!Moverover, this was something Young Lord Gu had personally allowed\u2026Taixuan Holy Lord couldn\u2019t help but show a smug smile as he thought about it.Many forces were paying close attention to the show happening outside the Taixuan Holy Land.Everything that happened here was broadcasted back home by the spies hidden in the dark, and that caused an uproar in the hidden forces.Chu Wuji was an Emperor with a violent temper, so how could he stay quiet after hearing such words full of disdain? His face turned green and he almost burst out.\u201cChu Wuji, wait! Things aren\u2019t looking right, and I don\u2019t think everything is simple. Taixuan Holy Land\u2019s people are acting too weirdly\u2026\u201dVoid Yang Holy Land\u2019s Supreme Elder frowned and held back the old emperor who was about to launch an attack. Although he had also brought along their supreme weapon, he didn\u2019t dare bring it out until he measured the depths of the other side\u2019s strength.The reaction of the Taixuan Holy Land under the watchful eyes of so many wolves disturbed his heart. After all, many major forces of the Eastern Wilderness had gathered together, and the Taixuan Holy Land was in a situation where there was not enough meat for every wolf that glared at them, but they were still so calm and arrogant.The Supreme Elder\u2019s curiosity rose and he wanted to know about this mysterious Young Lord backing the Taixuan Holy Land. It seemed that their previous guesses were far from the truth. Just how strong was this Young Lord\u2019s origin to fill the Taixuan Holy Land with so much confidence?Zhao Tian had lived for thousands of years and lived through many situations, so his mind churned as he calculated all the possibilities. It didn\u2019t take long for him to analyze that something was very wrong at this moment. A chill went down his spine and cold sweat flowed down his forehead.\u2018Is the intelligence incorrect? Or did the Taixuan Holy Land deliberately released that information to lure everyone out?\u2019People from the other major forces couldn\u2019t help but have a change in their expressions. They weren\u2019t dumb either, so they also figured out that something was wrong.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s right, Su Taixuan! It\u2019s just as you said \u2014 we are here to get a glimpse of the Young Lord\u2019s majestic appearance. My Xiao family received the news a long while ago and knew of the esteemed Young Lord\u2019s presence in your Taixuan Holy Land\u2026\u201d\u201cWe have indeed come to pay our respects!\u201dAt this time, a burly man wearing a gold armor walked out of a mighty warship with a smile, and appeared in front of the Taixuan Holy Land.His loud voice echoed everywhere.*\u201dIs this Xiao Huo for real\u2026\u201d*The sudden words from the man stunned many cultivators in the surroundings. Many of them were left dumbfounded. They couldn\u2019t believe if what they heard was true.How long did it take for the Ancient Xiao Family\u2019s Patriarch to change his attitude? No matter who it was, they all thought that he changed faces too fast!When they arrived here, who was the one posturing and saying he would wash the Taixuan Holy Land with blood?The people couldn\u2019t help but curse him for his shamelessness. Immediately afterwards, they also changed their words and expressed their desire to pay respects to the Young Lord.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right! I am also here to pay the Young Lord a visit.\u201d\u201cI hope the Taixuan Holy Lord will report our arrival to the Young Lord!\u201d\u2018This Su Taixuan isn\u2019t\u2019 simple\u2026The sudden and drastic change in the situation surprised Zhao Tian. At the same time, he secretly cursed all these two-faced bastards in his heart. Fortunately, he hadn\u2019t taken the initiative in attacking the Taixuan Holy Land just then.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All the fierce people from the Sects, Dynasties, and Families that had come with an aggressive intent now showed amiable and kind smiles. Even the short-tempered Emperor of the Great Sun Dynasty, Chu Wuji, was held back by the people around him.If an outsider were to see the scene right now, they would think that all of them were fellows from the same family.\u2018Might is right \u2014 that\u2019s indeed the truth of this world!\u2019\u2018As long as Qingge can keep on receiving Young Lord Gu\u2019s love, how is it possible for all these folk to not take a u-turn when they see me in the future?\u2019The Taixuan Holy Lord thought in his heart. The sudden change in his adversaries excited him beyond measure, but on the surface, he still showed his proud and arrogant expression.He was smart, and knew full well his place in the world.If the Taixuan Holy Land didn\u2019t have Gu Changge backing them up today, then this bunch of wolves would have most certainly torn it apart. By the time they finished dealing with their Taixuan Holy Land, they would be left tattered in ruins \u2014 robbed of their millenniums-deep heritage.Not just him, but everyone in the Taixuan Holy Land felt great awe and deep gratitude towards Gu Changge. They knew full well who was responsible for eliciting such a response from all of these bigshots of the Eastern Wilderness!Gu Changge could bring them to Heaven, and just as easily, he could topple them back to Hell, too!\u201cYou must show your sincerity if you want to see Young Lord Gu! Not just any tom, dick, and harry can gaze upon his divine visage.\u201dFinishing his words, the Taixuan Holy Lord sneered and turned into a ray of divine light, disappearing into the depths of the Taixuan Holy Land. After all, all the bigshots had arrived, so the most urgent matter for him was to see if Young Lord Gu would be willing to meet them.That\u2019s just the way it was \u2014 after all, a fox could only exploit a tiger\u2019s might when the tiger itself willed for it.[VILFIC: \u2018the fox exploits the tiger\u2019s might\u2019 means using powerful connections to intimidate people.]It was for that purpose that the Taixuan Holy Lord suddenly visited Gu Changge\u2019s palace. His report surprised Gu Changge. He hadn\u2019t expected this old man to posture in front of all the bigshots like that using his name.However, Gu Changge was too lazy to deal with such trivial matters, so he let the Taixuan Holy Lord do whatever he wanted. Instead of the matter outside, he was more interested in the good play at hand.Hopefully, Su Qingge wouldn\u2019t let him down.\u2026\u2026\u201cDamn this, that Su Taixuan\u2019s too arrogant! I want to tear off that annoying smirk on his face\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just a bit lucky! What\u2019s so great about that?\u201dMany people uttered remarks full of rage outside the Taixuan Holy Land, but in their hearts, they only held envy. Still, no one dared to break into the Taixuan Holy Land anymore. Everyone could tell that the only reason the Taixuan Holy Land\u2019s people dared to be so arrogant was that they had latched onto the thigh of that mysterious Young Lord.It was enough to restraint them and show them that the Young Lord backing the Taixuan Holy Land wasn\u2019t a random nobody.If they accidentally provoked this beast, wouldn\u2019t they bring a disaster upon the forces behind themselves?Of course, most of them held curiosity about the identity of this mysterious Young Lord. Especially the young heirs who followed the Elders of their Holy Lands and Great Dynasties.Among them, there were many men and women shrouded in divine lights, who had achieved great success in their cultivation.On normal days, these young heirs prided themselves as the leaders of the Easter Wilderness\u2019 younger generation, but today, they received a great shock from what they saw.A single, unknown young man had restrained so many major forces of the Eastern Wilderness without even showing up.\u201cAll of this is too unbelievable! Could that Young Lord be an existence from the Middle State?\u201dA youth with bright, golden hair couldn\u2019t help but ask. He was the Holy Son of the Void Yang Holy Land, who had tagged along his Elders to take part in today\u2019s battle to gain some experience and deepen his insights into his cultivation.He had never expected to witness such a dramatic scene, so he couldn\u2019t help but subconsciously think the Young Lord came from the Middle State.After all, unlike remote regions like their Eastern Wilderness, places like the Middle State were famous for their outstanding people with great cultivation bases. They even had forces that had connections to the mythical Upper Realm. Their ancestors had once shattered the barrier and ascended, so their backgrounds were powerful beyond their imaginations.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple. Although the powers in Middle State are mighty, they aren\u2019t enough to make the Taixuan Holy Land this arrogant!\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s matter is absolutely not what we had expected\u2026\u201dThe Supreme Elder of the Void Yang Holy Land, Zhao Tian, couldn\u2019t help but show an awkward smile. Although he had the demeanor of an Immortal as he floated in the air, even he didn\u2019t dare go anywhere near the Taixuan Holy Land now. He could only wait outside their gate with respect, just like the others.\u2026\u2026[Another palace in the Taixuan Holy Land at this time.]Gu Changge\u2019s sudden departure stunned Su Qingge for a while, and then she returned to the palace where she lived and cultivated.She was distressed!She couldn\u2019t help but rack her mind to think how she had offended Gu Changge this time, so much so that he had directly left without saying a single word of complaint.But even after straining her brain beyond its capacity, she couldn\u2019t figure out what wrong she had committed. In the end, she could only sigh and accept it as something Gu Changge would do. After all, he was truly elusive, and no one could tell what went through his mind.As for the great forces of the Eastern Wilderness banding together against their Taixuan Holy Land? Su Qingge didn\u2019t even fret over that matter.She knew of Gu Changge\u2019s origin, and understood more than anyone else how terrifying his background was. As long as the forces at their door weren\u2019t senile, they would never attack the Taixuan Holy Land while Gu Changge was still staying in it.They wouldn\u2019t dare in the future either.\u201cWho is there?!\u201dSuddenly, Su Qingge\u2019s expression changed as she felt an unknown presence nearby. No matter what, she was still the Holy Maiden of the Taixuan Holy Land who had cultivated using the best resources since her childhood, so it wasn\u2019t hard for her to find mild fluctuations in the atmosphere around her with her strength that was the best among her peers.At the same time, the person hiding in the dark also walked out.\u201cQingge\u2026\u201dThe person in front of Su Qingge had handsome features, but right now, he looked extremely worn down with his pale face, bloodshot eyes, and disheveled hair.A single look would be enough to tell that the person had suffered a lot for a good few days.His emotions were in a turmoil, too, as he had finally met the person he worried about the most over the last few days.\u201cYe Chen\u2026\u201dSu Qingge frowned as she immediately recognized Ye Chen.Ever since he was imprisoned in the dungeon, Su Qingge hadn\u2019t asked about his condition \u2014 nor had she gone down to visit him \u2014 just like everyone else. After all, she had guaranteed Gu Changge that she would no longer bother about Ye Chen, so she would obviously not get involved with him anymore.She had her own principles and conscience!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How did he suddenly appear here? Had he escaped?Su Qingge couldn\u2019t help but wrinkle her brows as the various questions floated in her mind. Ye Chen, however, didn\u2019t notice the minor changes in her expression.After his Master, Yan Ji, consumed the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill], the strength of her remnant spirit had increased and she helped him escape the dungeon. But the first thing Ye Chen did after escaping wasn\u2019t to leave the Taixuan Holy Land, instead, he rushed over to the Holy Maiden\u2019s Hall to look for Su Qingge.It was easy for him to sneak inside unnoticed with Yan Ji\u2019s help.What surprised Ye Chen after he sneaked in, though, was the fact that Su Qingge \u2014 who would normally spend all her time engrossed in cultivation in her palace \u2014 wasn\u2019t inside. Unease kept clawing at his heart as he imagined the reasons.Was she forced by Gu Changge and now lived with him?It broke Ye Chen\u2019s heart as that thought appeared in his mind, and he hid inside the Holy Maiden\u2019s Hall with a heavy heart.Fortunately, he finally saw Su Qingge again.\u201cQingge, you must have suffered over the last few days\u2026\u201dYe Chen said these words, but didn\u2019t know how to continue. Su Qingge didn\u2019t look haggard at all, instead, she was as bright as ever. Her thrilling beauty appeared even more ethereal now. He wanted to ask how she had been over the last few days, but didn\u2019t know how to speak.No matter how he looked at her, it didn\u2019t seem that Su Qingge was having a hard time.Su Qingge, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t help but frown after she listened to Ye Chen\u2019s words, and asked, \u201cYe Chen, why are you here?\u201d\u201cAsk this later, we don\u2019t have any time right now for explanations. Qingge, I will bring you away from the Taixuan Holy Land right now. I will bring you out of this fiery pit of hell!\u201dYe Chen walked towards Su Qingge as he spoke.In his opinion, Su Qingge\u2019s father and Gu Changge had forced her against her will, and everyone in the entire Taixuan Holy Land were persecuting her, too!She had no choice \u2014 Ye Chen could tell. She was caged in a fiery pit full of hellfire. She would not be happy in a place like this. Only when she left with him and cultivated together, would she be able to regain that flawless and innocent smile he had seen in the past.Su Qingge immediately stepped back, preventing Ye Chen from touching even her sleeve. Her brows were still creased together, and she said in a cold and annoyed tone, \u201cYe Chen, why can\u2019t you understand that I will never leave the Taixuan Holy Land?!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t leave with me, then I will forcefully bring you away! Unlike Gu Changge, I will never force you to do something you don\u2019t like.\u201d[VILFIC: bruh\u2026recall your last line.]Ye Chen couldn\u2019t care about such trivial matters right now. He spoke domineering words, and even prepared himself to use some force.Time was running out!If the Elders of the Taixuan Holy Land discovered them, they won\u2019t be able to get away easily.\u201cYou won\u2019t force me to do something I don\u2019t like? Considering our previous friendship, I will act as if today\u2019s matter never happened! You aren\u2019t my opponent with your current strength.\u201dSu Qingge replied, still wearing a calm expression.She was a legitimate Transcendent Realm cultivator, even stronger than the newly-appointed Taixuan Holy Son. Ye Chen was only in the Spirit Palace Realm, so it would be almost impossible for him to defeat her.And once they started fighting, the disturbance caused by them would most definitely attract the Elders and bring them here.\u201cQingge, why are you so stubborn even at a time like this? Have you already submitted your fate to that oppressor, Gu Changge?\u201dYe Chen couldn\u2019t believe his own regret-laced words. Who knows what might have happened between Su Qingge and Gu Changge over the days he was imprisoned?Su Qingge\u2019s calm expression didn\u2019t change, and she said, \u201cYoung Lord Gu has never oppressed me! Everything I did was out of my own volition. Ye Chen, don\u2019t be too biased \u2014 Young Lord Gu might not be the greatest person, but he\u2019s not as evil as you think.\u201d\u201cMy body is still pure, and Young Lord Gu hasn\u2019t touched me even once! This is the best proof of his character.\u201dSu Qingge\u2019s voice held a hint of self-deprecation as she continued, \u201cInstead, it\u2019s me who has been having impure intentions and trying to win Young Lord Gu\u2019s love!\u201dSu Qingge wanted to take this opportunity to make sure Ye Chen understood full well that there was nothing possible between them, and it would be better if he didn\u2019t associate with her again.\u2026\u2026\u2018Am I really that good?\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but show an inexplicable smile as he watched the show with great interest, hidden outside the palace.His ability at getting himself a borrowed knife was truly marvelous and unfathomable.Having said that, this Su Qingge had truly overestimated him. This was the terror of self-rationalizing ones own thoughts.Gu Changge naturally kept an eye on Ye Chen\u2019s every move, and knew full well where he would go as soon as he escaped. He had been looking forward to this show between the heroine and the protagonist.So far, Su Qingge hadn\u2019t let him down.[Ding! Ye Chen\u2019s relationship with the heroine has been destroyed. Ye Chen lost 50 Points in Fortune Value. You received 250 Destiny Points!]The sudden System prompt only deepened Gu Changge\u2019s smile.\u2018Ye Chen, ah, Ye Chen! You poor Son of Heaven, you will soon end up played to death by your own hands.\u2019Ye Chen was elated when Su Qingge confessed that Gu Changge had never touched her, so much so that all the depression and rage in his heart from the past few days had been wiped out.But\u2026her next words stunned him. Those words were like a bolt from the blue. He was stupefied!\u201cWhat?!\u201dContrary to his expectations, it was Su Qingge who had been having impure intentions and tried to please Gu Changge to gain his love?His head buzzed, and he couldn\u2019t believe the words he heard.\u2018Haiz! Little Chen\u2019s prejudice against Young Lord Gu runs too deep\u2026\u2019Yan Ji thought to herself as she sat cross-legged in the void inside the ring, bored. Her spirit appeared more firm after she had consumed the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill]. She naturally saw the scene that happened outside, and she could understand Su Qingge\u2019s decision.After all, who was Young Lord Gu? He was far too attractive for a woman!He had an outstanding appearance, a mighty cultivation base, and a terrifying background\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s a method used to train pets. When they do well you give them the carrot (reward) that they like, and when they do bad you give them the stick (punishment) that they dislike. This way, you can condition someone to behave exactly as you like.Su Qingge was a smart and rational woman, so now that she had decided to follow Gu Changge, there was no way she would have anymore to do with Ye Chen.There was absolutely no doubt about this!As a woman, Yan Ji could easily guess Su Qingge\u2019s thoughts. If she were in Su Qingge\u2019s shoes, she would do the same. And it was precisely because of this that she couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Why did Little Chen have to be so hostile to Young Lord Gu?\u201cQingge, you are lying to me, right? You are joking with me, right?!\u201dAn elegant scent filled the hall, but Ye Chen couldn\u2019t enjoy it. His head buzzed and ached, and he couldn\u2019t help but clutch his forehead. He couldn\u2019t believe that Su Qingge, the cold and aloof maiden, would say such words with her own tongue.\u201cI have only said the truth, and it\u2019s up to you whether you believe my words or not. Also, please don\u2019t come to pester me in the future! If Young Lord Gu saw us together by chance, I am afraid I will have to provide him an explanation\u2026\u201dSu Qingge\u2019s gorgeous face still had a calm expression, but the words she uttered held no mercy.She had said what she had to say, so if Ye Chen didn\u2019t stop his obsession with her, then she would need to take some extreme measures.\u201cIt must be Gu Changge\u2026he must have used some sorcery to muddle your mind! He comes from the legendary Upper Realm, so he definitely knows such methods\u2026\u201dYe Chen suddenly growled in a loud voice. His eyes turned bloodshot and he glared at Su Qingge, looking like a beast that stared at its prey.\u201cCalm down, Little Chen! Or you will suffer from Qi deviation!\u201dYan Ji saw Ye Chen\u2019s unstable state of mind from inside the ring, and immediately used her Qi to spread waves of coolness through his body to calm him down.\u201cI don\u2019t believe this\u2026\u201dYe Chen groaned. Why was the goddess he admired now acting like this?Su Qingge\u2019s face turned cold, too. She unsheathed her long sword and prepared to attack.[Thump! Thump! Thump!]At this moment, someone suddenly knocked the door of the hall, and a chuckle sounded, \u201cIs Holy Maiden Qingge present here?\u201dGu Changge stood at the door with a peculiar smile, dressed in a black dress that accentuated his handsome features, and gave him a sinister-yet-charming attractiveness.It was high time he joined in on the show. After all, he couldn\u2019t put all the burden on Su Qingge alone, right?Hearing the voice of his old acquaintance, Gu Changge, Ye Chen\u2019s expression also changed drastically as deep hatred and a murderous intent replaced his previous face full of disbelief.\u201cLittle Chen, leave immediately!\u201dYan Ji\u2019s expression changed to, and she urged him to leave.Although Gu Changge had said he wouldn\u2019t make things difficult for her, they were now fugitives who had escaped from their imprisonment.If he used this reason to deal with them, they would have nothing to refute him with!The sudden knock from the outside stunned Su Qingge, and doubts surfaced in her mind. Why had Young Lord Gu come to find her right at this time?No! With his unfathomable strength, he might have arrived long ago, but decided not to show up. Perhaps, this was a test from him![Puff\u2026]Attack!That was Su Qingge\u2019s simple idea.The immense might of the Transcendent Realm surged, and a cold, sharp sword light horribly pierced through the void in front of her. In the next moment, it drew blood!\u201cUrgh\u2026\u201dYe Chen screamed out and momentarily stopped in his tracks. He was about to escape when he was almost stabbed in the heart by Su Qingge\u2019s cruel sword.Had it not been for his powerful combat instinct, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to shift himself by a step to prevent the sword from piercing his heart.\u201cNot good\u2026\u201d\u201cThis little girl is a bit cruel!\u201dYan Ji never expected Su Qingge to be so ruthless and determined, so much so that she directly aimed at Ye Chen\u2019s life. Fortunately, her remnant spirit was in a good state, so he hurriedly swept Ye Chen away using her powers, and directly fled through a window.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dGu Changge seemed to be a little confused and surprised when he heard the sudden disturbance, and immediately pushed open the hall\u2019s door to walk in.\u201cYoung Lord Gu\u2026\u201d Su Qingge looked back at Gu Changge with a calm expression and said, \u201cQingge has disappointed you.\u201dShe naturally knew that Gu Changge was merely pretending. From the beginning to the end, he must have hid in the secret to watch this farce.A cold chill ran down her spine.One mistake in your performance, and you would fall down a bottomless abyss of despair. What\u2019s more? She didn\u2019t even know that Gu Changge was hiding in the dark all this time. He saw everything she said and did.He was a truly terrible man!\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t disappointed me.\u201dGu Changge said with a smile that appeared full of happiness.\u201cReally?\u201dSu Qingge couldn\u2019t believe his words. She had tried to kill Ye Chen just now, but he somehow evaded her attack. She was worried that Gu Changge would blame her for being merciful to him.\u201cNaturally, what I said is the truth!\u201dGu Changge replied with a smile, again. If killing Ye Chen was so easy, he wouldn\u2019t be having such a headache right now!\u201cThe next time you meet, there will probably be a blood feud between you and Ye Chen. Do you regret it?\u201dSu Qingge shook her head and replied, \u201cI already expected this day to come when I chose to be with Young Lord Gu!\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dGu Changge nodded with his unabated smile.[VILFIC: unabated \u2192 without any reduction in intensity or strength. If I see some new word, I will add their meaning in a note like this so you don\u2019t have to search. If you see some new word that\u2019s hard to understand on the first read, let me know in the comments.]Su Qingge\u2019s relationship with Ye Chen was completely destroyed now, and they could even be said to be life and death enemies.He doesn\u2019t have to be as harsh on her anymore.The so-called\u00a0\u2018carrot and stick\u2019\u00a0could truly make someone surrender.What\u2019s more? Su Qingge was also blessed with great fortune that was far beyond ordinary people, so her future achievements wouldn\u2019t be low either.Gu Changge naturally wanted Su Qingge on his side so he could use her well. After all, he no longer had to fear getting struck by a Fortune Backlash.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I wasn\u2019t testing you this time \u2014 I already had complete trust in you from the beginning until the end. I merely wanted to watch a good scene!\u201dGu Changge said with a chuckle, and with just the right amount of gentleness, he pulled her in his embrace.The sudden change stunned Su Qingge, and she didn\u2019t know what to do as she stood rooted to her spot. Her delicate body trembled, and she blinked her flawless, gem-like eyes in confusion.It was the first time she had been this close to a man. And to compound the effect, the man was none other than Gu Changge, the cold and intimidating monster she couldn\u2019t see through.Su Qingge had never expected to hear such gentle words from Gu Changge, so the sudden tenderness immediately threw her heart into chaos.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just now, even her heart had skipped a beat. To hear such tender words from someone like Gu Changge momentarily moved her heart, and she even felt flattered.But\u2026she understood that nine out ten words that came out of Gu Changge\u2019s mouth weren\u2019t honest truths.Accompanying a monarch was no different from accompanying a tiger (both could tear you apart at the slightest negligence).She was still far away from truly winning Gu Changge\u2019s love.\u201cQingge is touched to know that Young Lord trusts Qingge so much!\u201dSu Qingge replied. Her flawless, lovely face held a gentle smile as she let her supple figure lean against Gu Changge\u2019s body.\u201cAre you truly touched, or do you dare not be touched?\u201dGu Changge casually asked with a smile.A woman as clever as Su Qingge would never surrender just because he said a word or two with some gentleness. But that didn\u2019t matter, after all, wasn\u2019t there a saying that:\u00a0\u2018familiarity breeds fondness\u2019?[Ding! You have triggered a Fortuitous Event! Your Fortune Value has increased by 60 Points, and your Destiny Points have increased by 300!]A sudden System prompt sounded at this time and surprised Gu Changge.Unknowingly, his Fortune Value had broke through the 100 points mark. Still, the color hadn\u2019t changed, and it was still Dark.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but wonder how much change it made when compared to his initial 30 Points of Fortune Value. At the same time, he felt that things had become more interesting.To put it in simple terms, if he could quickly raise his Fortune Value, then even if he meets other Favored Children of Heaven, he wouldn\u2019t have as much trouble to deal with them as he did with Ye Chen.After all, if not for his overpowered Fortune protecting him, Gu Changge would have long slapped Ye Chen to death. He wouldn\u2019t have to go through so many hoops to deal with an ant like him.\u2018It seems that I can increase my Fortune Value even without messing with those Favored Children of Heaven, as long as I come across other people who are also blessed with great Fortune.\u2019\u2018Although it seems that my words had no effect on Su Qingge, that\u2019s only on the surface; deep down, she has already begun to surrender herself to me!\u2019\u2018It\u2019s because of this that my Fortune Value increased out of nowhere\u2026\u2019Gu Changge didn\u2019t even need to ask the System to guess this much, and he was correct in his conjectures. In addition to suppressing the Favored Children of Heaven, he now had another method of earning Fortune Value and Destiny Points:\u00a0\u2018conquering those favored with great Fortune!\u2019\u2026\u2026The people of Taixuan Holy Land soon discovered Ye Chen\u2019s disappearance from the dungeon. His escape enraged many elders and disciples, but soon, unease and apprehensiveness filled their hearts.After all, Ye Chen had offended Young Lord Gu!But because of their poor supervision, Ye Chen had escaped.If Young Lord Gu were to put the blame on their heads, then even cutting down 10,000 heads in their Taixuan Holy Land might not suffice.The Taixuan Holy Lord, who was previously smug and arrogantly postured before the other forces, panicked after he learnt of this matter. The thoughts about their fate disturbed his heart and mind.\u201cFather, don\u2019t worry so much! Young Lord Gu won\u2019t blame you for this.\u201dDifferent from him, Su Qingge sat there without any worry.Taixuan Holy Lord relaxed after hearing her words. He remembered that his good daughter was getting more and more of Young Lord Gu\u2019s attention and love.\u201cQingge, you must speak a few good words for your father if Young Lord Gu truly blames me!\u201dTaixuan Holy Lord said.Su Qingge\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but she wanted to roll her eyes at her father\u2019s words. She felt helpless in her heart. How could she change Young Lord Gu\u2019s mind if he truly intended to do something?\u201cFather, don\u2019t worry.\u201dStill, she assured the Taixuan Holy Lord.Su Qingge could tell that Gu Changge had deliberately let Ye Chen go. As for the reason, that\u2019s what she couldn\u2019t guess.\u2026\u2026[In the Taixuan Holy Lord\u2019s Hall]Many figures stood unmoving with a solemn and quiet atmosphere around them. At the helm of the crowd stood many of the bigshots like Zhao Tian, the Supreme Elder of the Void Yang Holy Land, Chu Wuji, the Emperor of the Great Sun Dynasty, and Xiao Huo, the Patriarch of the Ancient Xiao Family.All the forces that had come to invade the Taixuan Holy Land were present in the grand hall. Among them were men and women, young and old, but at this moment, all of them stood on their spots with respectful attitudes without making a squeak.Let alone squeak\u2026they didn\u2019t even dare to breath out loud.These forces together made the greatest might of the Eastern Wilderness, yet they were like this now.Under the Taixuan Holy Lord\u2019s arrangements, everyone had come to the Holy Lord\u2019s Hall in hopes of meeting Gu Changge. Only when they arrived did they get the news that this Young Lord Gu was someone from the legendary Upper Realm!The news shocked them to their cores!.Like a meteorite crashing into the deep sea, stormy waves set off in everyone\u2019s hearts and they couldn\u2019t calm down at all.Upper Realm!It was an extremely mysterious and unreachable place for the people of the Eastern Wilderness, but it also represented unmatched might and terrifying sovereignty.They hadn\u2019t heard of anyone breaking the barrier and ascending to the Upper Realm in the last 50,000 years. To them, the existences from the Upper Realm were nothing more than illusory legends.But now, they were told that a Young Lord from the Upper Realm and descended upon their Lower Realm to gain experience!It was as if they got to witness the birth of a legend, so how could it not cause a massive surge in their hearts?It was an evident result.\u2018No wonder the Taixuan Holy Lord is so calm and arrogant even in the face of so many forces! If out Sect was lucky enough to meet this Young Lord, we would probably be even more arrogant than him\u2026\u2019Zhao Tian, Chu Wuji, Xiao Huo, and the others had the exact same thought running through their minds.They held envy, jealousy, and hatred for the Taixuan Holy Land in their hearts. But at the same time, they rejoiced over the fact that they hadn\u2019t barged in and attacked right away.Ascension was easy, the true herculean task was descent from the Upper Realm!Everyone could tell that the origins of this Young Lord couldn\u2019t be ordinary. He was an absolutely terrifying existence they mustn\u2019t provoke, no matter what!Right now, everyone was extremely curious about the Young Lord, and wanted to get a glimpse of his divine visage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Be it the mighty Elders or the prodigious youth, they couldn\u2019t help but open their eyes wide as they saw a young man suddenly appear above them.He had appeared out of thin air, without causing a single fluctuation! They felt as if he didn\u2019t even exist, and they were hallucinating.The young man had a calm and indifferent expression. He wore a black dress without any adornments, but his natural born charm gave him an incomprehensible lofty nobleness.Behind the man stood a respectful Taixuan Holy Lord, and a woman in white with a veil obscuring half of her face. The woman\u2019s ethereal figure immediately attracted the attention of many young men.\u201cHoly Lord Taixuan\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Taixuan Holy Maiden\u2026she\u2019s the one known as the number one beauty of our Eastern Wilderness\u2026\u201d\u201cNo wonder!\u201d\u201cWe pay our respects to the Young Lord!\u201dImmediately, everyone in the hall bowed in greeting. They couldn\u2019t help but show extreme courtesy towards the mighty figure that had appeared before them.Zhao Tian, Chu Wuji, Xiao Huo, and the others from the older generations were the most shocked. The strength of the Young Lord in front of them was truly unfathomable, so much so that they couldn\u2019t even estimate his Realm.It gave them a sense of horror as if they were staring into a bottomless abyss!\u201cNo need to be so polite, everyone!\u201dGu Changge responded unenthusiastically.He would certainly not refuse if someone asked him show his face and posture before others. After all, it allowed him to bring the major forces of the Eastern Wilderness down a peg since many of them were getting quite chummy with that Ye Chen.To someone like him, it was trivial to deal with Ye Chen. As long as he said a word, no one among these forces would have the guts to associate themselves with Ye Chen anymore.Those who have achieved the Dao can help more than those who haven\u2019t, after all![VILFIC: might is right. The mighty are better than the weak that got slapped.]Gu Changge wanted to see how long this Ye Chen\u2019s Fortune would last.Afterwards, everyone introduced the forces behind them, as eloquently as they could, to give Gu Changge a good impression. Gu Changge, however, lacked interest in these pleasantries and kept on his calm and indifferent expression. His mind, on the other hand, was lost in thought about his own Attributes Panel.As for Ye Chen, it won\u2019t be long before he got crushed now that he had cut him so much. That [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill] wasn\u2019t so easy to use \u2014 Gu Changge had left a mark on it with a secret technique recorded in the [Immortal Devouring Demon Art].Yan Ji might have discovered the abnormality if she were still at her peak, but in her current condition, it would be impossible for her to see through his trick.As far as the [Immortal Devouring Demon Art] was concerned, Gu Changge didn\u2019t doubt the effectiveness of the secret techniques listed inside it.Where could Ye Chen go?He was nothing more than a treasure hunting tool for Gu Changge.No one noticed anything strange with Gu Changge. At this moment, he had his eyelids drooped as he sipped his tea.Fortunately, his temperament was like so. As long as he didn\u2019t smile, he would give others a deep sense of detachment.It was what they called a compelling temperament!Upon seeing this, everyone in the hall felt even more frightened and treaded even more cautiously, so as to not offend this mysterious and mighty Young Lord.Almost all the major forces were cautiously trying to please Gu Changge by asking him for his purpose in coming down to the Lower Realm, or what kind of hobbies he dabbled into.Gu Changge enjoyed this treatment with relish. Being a villain was awesome, indeed!\u2026\u2026Everyone in the hall could see that Su Qingge\u2019s relationship with Gu Changge was the reason the Taixual Holy Land so easily latched onto Gu Changge\u2019s thigh. Her title of the number one beauty of the Eastern Wilderness wasn\u2019t an empty one. Su Qingge was indeed a fairy in the hearts of countless young prodigies!Many old guys couldn\u2019t help but churn their minds to think if they had any such outstanding descendants in their family? Unfortunately, they had no one with an appearance as outstanding as Su Qingge\u2019s, so they soon gave up on the idea, lest they humiliate themselves.At this moment, Gu Changge\u2019s gaze fell upon a beautiful lady in the crowd, and he stood up and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cAh! Is Your Excellency talking to me?\u201dThe beautiful lady responded with a trembling voice laced with excitement. Admiration filled her starry eyes as she stared at him \u2014 she had never expected that Gu Changge would notice her.\u201cI am Wang Xue, a disciple of the Ten Thousand Flower Palace!\u201dEveryone stared at the beauty with shock. Many couldn\u2019t help but envy her as she was questioned by Gu Changge himself. It was a great honor to be questioned by this Young Lord, after all!Why did he find her somewhat familiar?\u201cHave you met me before? What\u2019s the relationship between you and Ye Chen?\u201dGu Changge asked with a flat tone.\u201cAh\u2026 Ye Chen\u2026\u201dThe disciple named Wang Xue found herself at a loss for words when she heard his question.\u201cXue\u2019er, the Young Lord is asking you something!\u201dHer master next to her was more anxious than her, wishing she could say a good word or two about them before Gu Changge.\u201cYour Excellency,Ye Chen is my ex-fianc\u00e9. I annulled my engagement with him three years ago\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen you were at the edge of the Forbidden Region of Ten Thousand Beasts some time ago, and slayed a terrifying beast of the Conferred Lord Realm with a single slash of your sword, I happened to be watching from the distance. I was saved by Your Excellency\u2019s grace, so\u2026\u201dWang Xue forced herself to calm down and explained in a hurry.Ye Chen\u2019s former fiancee who annulled her engagement with him three years ago?She happened to be saved by him?Gu Changge looked through his memories, and soon found the answer. Some time ago, his Original had gone to the Forbidden Region of Ten Thousand Beasts to see if he could get some fortuitous opportunity there.Naturally, he found nothing there.No wonder this woman had such deep admiration for him in her eyes. This admiration and karma was formed before he transmigrated over.[Hiss]\u2018He killed a terrifying beast of the Conferred Lord Realm with a single slash\u2026\u2019The people in the hall couldn\u2019t help but take in a cold breath as they heard Wang Xue\u2019s words. Zhao Tian, Chu Wuji, and the other old monsters were even more terrified, and their scalps turned numb.They wondered if their hearing had gone bad?Just what kind of terrifying might did this Young Lord hold?Elders of the Great-Transcendent Realm could travel thousands of miles, while Saints could already be lords of a Holy Land with territory spanning over millions of miles in the Eastern Wilderness. As for Conferred Lords\u2026they didn\u2019t even exist, and could be considered as invincible.To find a legitimate Conferred Lord, or even their traces, one would have to venture into some forbidden region like the Forbidden Region of Ten Thousand Beasts.Didn\u2019t this mean that their so-called behemoths of the Eastern Wilderness wouldn\u2019t even be able to take a single sword slash from this Young Lord?No one doubted Wang Xue\u2019s words!It shocked even Su Qingge, and she knew for the first time how fearful Gu Changge\u2019s true strength was. Truly, in front of him, the younger generation of the Eastern Wilderness were nothing more than a bunch of ants.Horror gripped everyone\u2019s heart, and their awe and reverence towards Gu Changge deepened.\u2018Heavens have mercy! It\u2019s good that I didn\u2019t ask anything about that Ye Chen before; I mustn\u2019t let my granddaughter have any contact with him in the future\u2026\u2019\u2018That Ye Chen is a dead man now! How could he offend such a monstrous existence?\u2019Cold sweat ran down the Void Yang Supreme Elder\u2019s back and he thanked thanked the Heavens in his heart. He had almost asked a death-courting question before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The various Holy Lands, Dynasties, and other major forces that went to besiege the Taixuan Holy Land did nothing, and instead, went into their Holy Lord\u2019s Hall to pay respects to a Young Lord.The unbelievable news stunned many cultivators, and they couldn\u2019t believe what they heard!At the same time, many [Imaging Stones] spread throughout the Eastern Wilderness containing the scenes of the entire debacle. Among the scenes was the scene of all the major forces banding together and gathering outside the Taixuan Holy Land.By now, almost every force of the Eastern Wilderness knew that a Young Lord had descended from the Upper Realm. The realization shocked many as the Upper Realm was no longer just a land of myths for them \u2014 it truly existed!Such a news couldn\u2019t be suppressed and it soon suppressed to other regions from the Eastern Wilderness, setting off a massive surge.\u201cThe Easter Wilderness is going to see unforeseeable changes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! To think a Young Lord from the Upper Realm would descend\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom ancient times, it\u2019s been said that Ascension is hard, but descending is impossible! After all, Gods coming down to the world of mortals is completely against the way of Heaven\u2026\u201d\u201cHoh! No wonder all these massive forces turned into meek kittens so suddenly \u2014 I had thought the Taixuan Holy Land wouldn\u2019t surprise their combined attack!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s truly unexpected! However, the Taixuan Holy Land sure has some divine luck on their side, for them to hug the thigh of such a Young Lord!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not all! I got some insider news about an Inner Sect Disciple named Ye Chen challenging the Young Lord and getting stomped to the ground!\u201dMany people talked through laughter in a restaurant.\u201cHahaha, I also heard about this,\u201d the person next to the speaker interjected with a roaring laughter.\u201cI heard it was because he was jealous over the Young Lord easily winning the heart of our Eastern Wilderness\u2019 number one beauty! He then overestimated himself and challenged the Young Lord in front of everyone; unfortunately for him, that Inner Disciple surnamed Ye got his face planted on the ground and was forced to kneel on all fours like a mutt, unable to move\u2026\u201d\u201cTsk, tsk, tsk, every toad wants to eat swan meat these days! What makes him think that he think he deserves the number one beauty of the Eastern Wilderness?\u201dThe cultivators talked about this matter while drinking, or even as after-dinner leisure talk. You could hear them talk about this matter with relish in every ancient city, wine shop, and pavilion.There were hundreds of millions of cultivators in the Eastern Wilderness. A single ancient city alone accommodated more than ten million residents. In just one day, this matter spread everywhere and caused an unimaginable sensation.\u2026\u2026[In an ancient city.]A man with an unhealthy complexion hurried through the streets. His fists creaked, and his face turned ugly as he overheard the conversations of the people around him.He couldn\u2019t help but grip his chest; he felt as if someone was trying to rip his heart out. A deep hatred flashed through his cold eyes, and he muttered to himself, \u201cSu Qingge, you bitch! How dare you betray me\u2026\u201d\u201cGu Changge, I will return this shame a hundred times over in the future!\u201dThis person was Ye Chen who had disguised himself for escape. The Eastern Wilderness naturally had no more place for him to stay. Just one word from Gu Changge would be enough to send the entire Eastern Wilderness on a witch-hunt against him.Ye Chen didn\u2019t dare to roam around with his original appearance! He planned to use the ancient city\u2019s large [Teleportation Array] to head towards the lands of the Middle State.Compare to the Eastern Desolate, the Middle State was far more mysterious and massive. Spiritual Veins were a dime a dozen, with great Sects, Holy Lands, and Sacred Mountains scattered everywhere in there. There was no shortage of inheritances, either!Gu Changge could cover the Eastern Wilderness with one hand, but could he do the same with the Middle State?What\u2019s more? There were many a Ancient Clans and Families in Middle State that had connections to the Upper Realm, as many of their ancestors had Ascended in the past.Ye Chen had planned well.With his powerful talent, he will naturally soar to the skies when he joins one of those powers.Wasn\u2019t Gu Changge so arrogant just because he had some backing in the Upper Realm? Then wouldn\u2019t Gu Changge be able to do nothing to him if he also got a big backer?He will most certainly make Su Qingge and Gu Changge regret their actions!Ye Chen calmed down and sneered as he thought about the future.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201dThe only matter that worried and puzzled Ye Chen was the fact his gorgeous Master hadn\u2019t spoken much after the incident in the Taixuan Holy Land. Only when he encountered some dangerous situation would his Master move to rescue him.Unease gripped Ye Chen\u2019s heart, and he clenched his fists. Could it be that Yan Ji also wanted to betray him and leave?He couldn\u2019t accept that!\u2026\u2026Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.\u201cAn invitation letter sent by the Third Prince of the Great Xia Dynasty from the Middle State? He\u2019s inviting young geniuses from every region to discuss the Dao?\u201dGu Changge took the invitation handed to him by Su Qingge, and looked through it. He lost interest after a single glance at the invitation\u2019s contents.The so-called young geniuses of the Lower Realm were nothing more than ants that he could crush with a single finger. Messing with Su Qingge and taking her advantage every day was far more interesting than this gathering of\u00a0\u2018geniuses\u2019.\u201cI have heard that a former emperor of the Great Xia Dynasty ascended to the Upper Realm, and they have an unfathomable background. What\u2019s more? The third prince himself is quite talented! When he was born, the sound of a Heavenly phenomenon was heard as far as three thousand miles away\u2026\u201dSu Qingge explained to Gu Changge.At the same time, her scallion-like fair and tender hands peeled open a [Spiritual Crystal Grape], and brought it before his mouth.\u2018Great Xia Dynasty, right?\u2019\u2018Middle State, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u2018Good! It\u2019s high time I moved to another map, too!\u2019Gu Changge ate the grapes fed to him thought about the matter.He stood up \u2014 life nowadays was getting too stale with nothing but leisure. He felt uncomfortable now that he didn\u2019t have that leek, Ye Chen, to cut.If he guessed correctly, then Ye Chen must be on his way to Middle State right now!\u201cAll the Holy Lands, Dynasties, and Ancient Families of the Eastern Wilderness will be settinf off to partake in this event in three days. Would you like to go along with them, Young Lord?\u201dSu Qingge asked.Gu Changge thought for a bit and nodded. At the same time, he recalled that Old Ming\u2019s family seemed to be in the Middle State of the Lower Realm. Old Ming had broken through the barrier to Ascend to the Upper Realm from the Middle State around thirty thousand years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With Old Ming\u2019s identity, it would be much easier for them to roam around in the Middle State.\u201cQingge will go and arrange everything then!\u201dGu Changge nodded to her in response. He had nothing to fret over when Su Qingge did the work herself.After Su Qingge left, Gu Changge pondered for a while and then said to thin air, \u201cOld Ming, you Ascended from the Middle State around thirty thousand years ago, right?\u201dA wave of fluctuations appeared in the air, and Old Ming\u2019s figure appeared from the void. With a tone full of respect, he answered, \u201cMy Lord, this slave indeed ascended from this Azure Realm\u2019s Middle State some thirty thousand years ago. When I had just arrived in the Upper Realm, I wasn\u2019t familiar with anything, and ended up getting captured by a powerful cultivator of the Upper Realm who turned me into a miner!\u201d\u201cThankfully, I met an Elder of the family (Gu Changge\u2019s) who rescued this old slave. It was all thanks to that Elder that this old slave could escape from that sea of suffering, or this old slave would have died in those mines!\u201dOld Ming felt emotional as he spoke of this past. The cultivators in the Lower Realm believed that Ascension was some grand matter, but in reality, it was something completely opposite.When the cultivators who have no background Ascend to the Upper Realm, their only fate is to be caught by some powerful existences of the Upper Realm to be miners and manual laborers. They lose any and all dignity, and spend the rest of their lives doing menial tasks!In Old Ming\u2019s eyes, those forces of the Middle State that had connections in the Upper Realm were merely putting on appearances. Their ancestors, on the other hand, were probably mining Spiritual Ore in some corner of the Upper Realm.Because of this, Old Ming felt immense gratitude towards the Gu family. He was fortunate to have come across that noble person from the Gu Family.\u201cI will head to the Middle State in three days, so you can check up on your family when we are there.\u201dGu Changge said with a light smile.After finally descending to the Lower Realm, Old Ming must also be looking forward to see how his descendants were doing after he left back then. It\u2019s just that he couldn\u2019t leave without Gu Changge\u2019s permission due to his identity and mission.Gu Changge\u2019s sudden permission moved Old Ming, and he thanked him, \u201cThank you for showing such consideration towards this old slave, My Lord!\u201dGu Changge waved his hand in response and said, \u201cOld Ming, there\u2019s no need for such courtesy; it\u2019s the least you deserve.\u201dGu Changge might be a villain who was born to trample the Favored Children of Heaven, but he wasn\u2019t an unkind fool.Old Ming was no outsider.This minor gesture from him could not only strengthen Old Ming\u2019s loyalty, but it could also show his magnanimity.How could Gu Changge not take such an advantage?\u2026\u2026Three days passed in the blink of an eye.An extremely gorgeous flying boat hovered high above in the sky outside the Taixuan Holy Land. Brilliant rays of light and mystical runes moved around the boat.If one looked closely, they would see pillars of light with majestic paintings, imperial pavilions shrouded in immortal mist, springs full of crystal-clear water, and fragrant flowers that could steal one\u2019s soul. The boat looked extremely luxurious as it floated among the clouds.It was an exclusive flying boat built for Gu Changge by all the major forces of the Eastern Wilderness, and it hadn\u2019t come at a small price.To put it bluntly, every inch of the flying boat was synonymous to luxury and wealth. Even the disciples of the various Holy Land widened their eyes in awe when they saw it, let alone the ordinary cultivators.None of them had seen such a majestic flying boat in their life.\u201cEveryone sure went all out\u2026\u201dGu Changge chuckled when he saw the high profile display. Still, he liked it.\u201cIt\u2019s just a little toy \u2014 nothing is overboard if it makes the Young Lord happy!\u201dThe Supreme Elders, Sect Masters, and Patriarchs of the major forces laughed. Young Lord Gu seemed satisfied with their hospitality, and that was enough for them to rejoice.After all, it was apparent to them that this Young Lord wasn\u2019t someone who liked to keep a low profile. Spending so much on this gorgeous flying boat wasn\u2019t a loss as long as they could get his appreciation. They had their priorities in order!\u201cYoung Lord, please.\u201dThe Taixuan Holy Lord requested Gu Changge to board the flying boat first, with a reverent expression. He was considered as Gu Changge\u2019s number one lapdog. And even though lapdogs were frowned upon, everyone around him held envy towards him.Gu Changge gave him a slight nod and boarded the boat first. The others followed a few steps behind him, not daring to walk ahead of him.This time, the young generation from all over the Realm were heading to the Middle State. There was the Void Yang Holy Son, the Void Yang Holy Maiden, the Young Emperor of the Great Sun Dynasty, the Ancient Xiao Family\u2019s Young Master, and many more\u2026All of them were the at the top among the younger generation in the Eastern Wilderness. But the pressure they felt from Gu Changge was a thousand times more terrifying than what they felt from their elders. Some of them had wanted to go forward for a chat, but they couldn\u2019t help but tremble in awe and swallow their words.In comparison to them, Gu Changge\u2019s first lapdog, Chu Xuan, was in an advantageous position.\u201cYe Chen will soon be squeezed dry, so who will be the next Favored Son of Heaven?\u201dGu Changge couldn\u2019t help but mutter to himself.\u201cWhat do you mean, Young Lord?\u201dHis words surprised Su Qingge, who was busy massaging his shoulders, as she couldn\u2019t understand why he said such words out of nowhere.\u201cQingge, do you want to follow me back to the Upper Realm?\u201dGu Changge suddenly asked with a smile.On normal days, Su Qingge would be very interested when he talked about the Upper Realm, but now, her expression didn\u2019t show any change, and she said, \u201cYoung Lord, haven\u2019t you used this same question to take advantage of me several times already?\u201d\u201cHow boring.\u201dGu Changge shook his head, and then gently brought her into his embrace. He loved to see Su Qingge\u2019s insincere display when she was actually annoyed.Sure enough, no matter who and where they were, bullying women was what men loved to do most.[VILFIC: frick you, I have never committed such\u00a0honorable\u00a0heinous act, nor thought about it, EVER! Hmph! Misandrist bastard author. (\u2019tis a joke)][Boom!]Soon, the void outside turned turbulent and set off a hurricane. Bright rays of light and mystical runes burst around the luxurious flying boat as it crushed the space around it and began to gallop through the void at a high speed, heading towards the lands of the Middle State.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In addition to the many Holy Lands and Great Dynasties that had existed for millenniums, there were also many great Clans and Ancient Families.Ancient creatures with mighty cultivation bases dwelled inside endless spans of sacred mountains. With their might alone, they could lord over a region of the world without issue.In addition to the humans, the Middle State had other races, too, that came into being in times immemorial.[Extreme Dao Academy, Central Heavenly City, Middle State]A group of youths \u2014 male and female \u2014 quietly listened to their teacher\u2019s explanation regarding cultivation. The teacher in question was a young beauty dressed in colorful robes.The thin layer of make up on her face compounded her charm. Her skin was like a milky jade, and her hair fell behind her like clouds. Her loose robes did nothing to hide her tall and plump figure that was fat where it should be and lean where it should be.Calling her a stunning enchantress wouldn\u2019t be an overstatement!At this moment, her eyes turned frosty, and she threw the jade slip in her hands towards the table of a dozing youth.\u201cLin Tian, how dare you sleep in my class again?!\u201d\u2026\u2026The land of the Middle State was divided into eight domains, and among them, the Central Heavenly City was the most prosperous. Many supreme Sects and ancient Orthodoxies had their roots in this place.The Extreme Dao Academy was also known as the Academy of Heavenly Geniuses. Many prodigious talents and young heroes gathered in this academy from various forces.It wouldn\u2019t be an understatement to call all the youths \u2014 male and female \u2014 who joined the Extreme Dao Academy the cream of the crop. They would have illustrious future achievements.Many Holy Lords, Emperors, and Patriarchs in the Middle State were once students of the Extreme Dao Academy when they were young.There was an exception in this room of the academy, however.The gorgeous teacher\u2019s eyes spewed frost as her rage surged and her body trembled. One could clearly see her hatred for the negligent student who snored in her presence.The other students in the class couldn\u2019t help but show disdain and ridicule him when they saw he was still snoring like a bear near them.\u201cWho allowed this trash to enter the Extreme Dao Academy? He\u2019s a shame to all that live under this sky!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! If not for the fact that he\u2019s from the Ancient Lin Family, and his sister\u2019s an Elder in the Academy, he would never have had the chance to sit in the same class as us!\u201d\u201cElder Lin Qiuhan\u2019s must be plagued with misfortune to have such a useless brother.\u201dThe students looked at the sleeping boy with eyes full of despise, and murmured among themselves.Of course, the one they were talking about was none other than Lin Tian!He was a well-known celebrity in the Extreme Dao Academy as he was the half-brother of the loose-robed beauty standing in front of them.Not only did he have abysmal talent for cultivation, but he was also a useless waste of Spiritual Qi who refused to put in any hard work on his cultivation, and often slept in the class.Calling him a waste of Spiritual Qi and burden on the Middle State didn\u2019t do justice to his uselessness.His sister Lin Qiuhan, however, was the Extreme Dao Academy\u2019s youngest and most beautiful Elder, with suitors that one couldn\u2019t count on a dozen hands. Even the Holy Sons of the various Holy Lands, and Young Emperors of the Great Dynasties pursued her.Lin Qiuhan\u2019s future was limitless!Still, this Lin Tian was more famous in the Extreme Dao Academy if the popularity of the two was to be compared.\u201cLin Tian\u2026\u201dSeeing that Lin Tian refused to wake up, the beauty\u2019s rage grew, and she raised her voice while walking towards him. It seemed that her loud shout had some effect, and the boy jumped to his feet.\u201cAh! This King refuses to accept this\u2026\u201dLin Tian screamed and looked around with a confused expression, still in a daze as if he hadn\u2019t truly woken up.\u201cWhere\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cThis King? Hahaha, what a clown!\u201d\u201cJust what the hell did this scum dream about now?\u201dWords full of mockery reverberated in the quiet room.Even more displeasure covered Lin Qiuhan\u2019s face as her rage brought her close to the point of bursting! Not only did this bastard sleep in her class, he even had the guts to ask her who she was?!Although he was her brother, there was no way she would let him off for his recklessness this time. She must teach him a lesson!\u201cAzure Realm, Middle State, Central Heavenly\u2026\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is\u2026\u201dLin Tian appeared as if he hadn\u2019t seen the lioness in front of him as he muttered to himself. His emotions were in a turmoil, but soon, he returned from his daze.Unexpectedly, he, the dignified Heaven Slaughter God King, reincarnated. The old and rubbish Lin Tian was no more, as he, the supreme God King, had replaced him and returned to life.He was the strongest God King of his generation, titled the Heaven Slaughter God King, who was known to be so strong that people believed he could even rival the Heavens!It\u2019s just that when he underwent his Ascension Tribulation, he encountered a terrible Spatial Crack, and fell before he could step into the mythical Upper Realm.But the Heavens had mercy on him, and an immortal ray of his remnant soul escaped and took over the body of this youth in lands foreign to him.Still, Lin Tian had some doubts.In his original world, one could only ascend to the mythical Upper Realm after they reached the God King Realm, but here, people could ascend as soon as they reached the False God Realm!In that case, wouldn\u2019t it be easy for him to stand at the top of this world with his past life memories?Lin Tian couldn\u2019t help but show a smug and confident expression as he thought about this. As for those who despised, ridiculed, and oppressed him? He, the dignified Heaven Slaughter God King, will slap their faces and stomp them under his feet sooner or later!And with his might and knowledge, even the Predecessor\u2019s obsession with his half-sister was no problem. Sooner or later, he will steal her heart and push her under him to fulfill his Predecessor\u2019s crush and desire, since the Predecessor himself didn\u2019t have the guts required to do that!As for morality regarding blood relations and whatnot? For an existence of his level, that nonsense wasn\u2019t worth fretting over.\u201cLin Tian, what are you smirking like an idiot for? If you can\u2019t break through to the Spirit Sea Realm by the end of this month, you will be expelled from the Extreme Dao Academy! By then, even the Family will not bother about you\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan couldn\u2019t help but wrinkle her brows as she watched Lin Tian ignore her, and her tone turned harsher.Lin Tian wasn\u2019t a legitimate heir, and instead, he was the son of a maid and had abysmal talent for cultivation. His situation in the Ancient Lin Family wasn\u2019t quite good, and no one in the family welcomed him.Lin Qiuhan had a naturally kind heart, so she would look after him on normal days. But Lin Tian\u2019s continuous lack of interest in improving himself gave her great disappointment.\u201cIs the Spirit Sea Realm all that powerful? Let alone a month, I can break through into the Spirit Sea Realm within half a day!\u201dLin Tian proclaimed with arrogance in his tone, and watched the surrounding disciples with eyes full of disdain and contempt.Lin Qiuhan felt that he was truly hopeless now, so she shook her head in utter disappointment.At the same time, a burst of laughter broke out in the otherwise-quiet classroom. Everyone felt that Lin Tian was still lost in a dream, and couldn\u2019t tell that he had woken up.Lin Tian, on the other hand, ignored their ridicule.He was someone who had once stood at the peak of the God King Realm, so how could these brats who were still wet behind the ears encompass the vastness of his great knowledge?He will slap them in their faces soon!\u2026\u2026[Boom!]A spatial turbulence caused an explosion in the sky, sending the surrounding winds into a great turbulence. An extravagant flying boat appeared in the sky out of nowhere. Covered in sacred rays of light with divine runes flowing around it\u2019s body, the flying boat had arrived inside the territory of the Middle State at breakneck speed.Gu Changge\u2019s robes fluttered in the wind, and his inky black hair danced around as he looked down.[Ding! A new Favored Child of Heaven has been detected!]A sudden System Prompt sounded in his mind, and he was stunned.Could it be that Ye Chen\u2019s Fortune Value had decayed too quickly, so he was going to face a new Favored Son of Heaven?It seems he will have another leek to cut very soon!\u201cThis old slave never expected to set foot on the land of the Middle State again in my life! I wonder what became of the family that I left behind 30,000 years ago?\u201dOld Ming respectfully stood behind Gu Changge and muttered to himself while looking at the scenery below. His emotions fluctuated as he watched the unfamiliar mountains, rivers, and plains in a daze.30,000 years were enough to turn seas into mulberry fields, and the ancient city he remembered might have long turned into ruins.[VILFIC: seas turning into mulberry fields \u2192 occurrence of great changes after a long span of time.]He felt nostalgia, but more than that, he felt a certain fear in his heart. What became of his descendants? Were they still around?\u201cSenior Ming, did you ascend to the Upper Realm from the Middle State?\u201dSu Qingge asked in surprise.This was the first time she heard of such a matter. She had thought that Old Ming was just like Gu Changge, someone who was born and bred in the Upper Realm.\u201cIndeed. Before my Ascension, this old slave had once created a Lin Family\u2026\u201dOld Ming replied with a smile. Only a few people knew that he was surnamed Lin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was considered a strong person even in the Upper Realm\u2019s Gu Family.It\u2019s just that he couldn\u2019t exert his true strength in the Lower Realm due to the World\u2019s Will, or he will be rejected by the World\u2019s Will of this Lower Realm, and expelled or attacked.He might be a God King, but that didn\u2019t mean he could ignore the laws of the world and tread wherever he desired to.\u201cI created the Lin Family all by myself!\u201dGu Changge nodded after listening to Old Ming\u2019s sound transmission. At the same time, he communicated with the System in his heart,\u00a0\u2018What\u2019s Ye Chen\u2019s current Fortune Value?\u2019He had clearly heard the System\u2019s Prompt just now. Since he changed the original trajectory of the world\u2019s advancement, the world itself intervened to correct the disparity, and a new Favored Child of Heaven had appeared.It seemed that Ye Chen\u2019s Heavenly Daddy was about to abandon him!Gu Changge guessed that the Favored Children of Heaven didn\u2019t follow the same template. There must be different cliches and plots, and that wouldn\u2019t be surprising to him. He was already guessing what template this new Favored Child of Heaven will have since the last one had the\u00a0\u2018annulled engagement\u2019\u00a0plot.The System replied,\u00a0[Host, Ye Chen has 230 Points of Fortune Value!]\u2018The reason I will suffer from a Fortune Backlash is because of my low Fortune Value when compared to these so-called Favored Children of Heaven, right? If my Fortune Value is high enough, I shouldn\u2019t suffer from it, right?\u2019The System\u2019s mechanical and flat voice sounded again,\u00a0[Yes! The Fortune Backlash will disappear over time as the Host\u2019s Fortune Value increases.]Gu Changge nodded with a thoughtful expression.Although Ye Chen was weak as a mosquito, it took Gu Changge a lot of effort to deal with him. After all, Gu Changge can easily crush someone like Ye Chen with his strength.It\u2019s just that the Heavenly Dao provided special protection to Ye Chen, and that made it impossible for him to directly obliterate Ye Chen in soul and body.One must keep in mind that Gu Changge started out with 30 Points in his Fortune Value, while Ye Chen had an overpowered 500 Points in his Fortune Value\u2026he had almost 20 times more Fortune Value than him.If one just compared strengths, then his Original could obliterate Ye Chen with his pinky alone.What Gu Changge found hard to believe was the fact that the Original, a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, only had 30 Points in Fortune Value.Gu Changge had thought about this matter for a long time, and realized that the reason was probably due to his Original\u2019s temperament \u2014 apart from his Villainous role in the story.The Original was a haughty and indifferent man who only cared about cultivation. He was completely dumb when it came to matters beside cultivation\u2026he was truly fit to be a cannon fodder whose only job was giving experience to the Protagonist.He even disdained to stomp an ant like Ye Chen!According to his character and actions, the world would probably follow this route:\u00a0\u2018Fortune Value is illusory and imperceptible. No matter how Ye Chen offended the Original, and no matter how many hard situations he found himself in, he would ultimately survive and the world would make it completely reasonable through coincidences!\u2019Since he had crossed over and knew all these cliches by heart, he would naturally not allow Ye Chen to make a comeback and step on him after stomping him under his feet.Gu Changge had become one of the so-called anomalies, and the Heavenly Dao was already finding it hard to shelter the Favored Children of Heaven using inexplicable\u00a0\u2018coincidences.\u2019Hence, the world brought forth Fortune Backlash to deal with the anomaly.It was just like how the human race had been established as the dominant race in Gu Changge\u2019s previous world\u2019s myths. Whoever tried to go against this law would be stuck by Heaven\u2019s punishment. Even the Sages didn\u2019t dare think about changing this reality.Of course, the world in front of him couldn\u2019t be compared to the mythical stories from his previous life, but the trend wasn\u2019t much different.The Favored Children of Heaven were meant to stand at the peak and achieve the Dao, that was the will of Heaven. The position of the Favored Children of Heaven wasn\u2019t for nothing.Although it brought joy to him to slowly reap Fortune Value from the Favored Children of Heaven, but it also gave him a feeling of restraint, and Gu Changge didn\u2019t like that.Fortunately, Gu Changge no longer felt a threat to his life when he thought about taking Ye Chen\u2019s life.He guessed that his Fortune Value had increased to a reasonable high. It comforted him at once!As the System said:\u00a0\u2018When his Fortune Value increased to a certain amount, even the Heavenly Dao would need to submit and wouldn\u2019t be able to be so partial anymore. It would need to use the so-called coincidences to deal with him if it wanted to protect those Favored Children of Heaven \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be able to strike him down with a Heavenly Bolt from the blue.\u2019Gu Changge looked through his Attribute Panel\u2019s current state.Host: Gu ChanggeIdentity: True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao PalaceBloodline: Devil Heart, Dao BoneCultivation: Conferred Lord (Middle Stage)Mystical Abilities:Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex (7th Layer)Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple (Talent)Myriad Changes Demonic Physique (Talent)Immortal-Devouring Demon Art\u2026Destiny Points: 100Fortune Value: 120 (Dark)System Shop: OpenWarehouse:Domain-Traversing Talisman x1One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x1[VILFIC: I have cleaned this panel somewhat. I presume the dots under the Mystical Abilities section is there to show that he has more Abilities but they aren\u2019t worth mentioning.]Gu Changge had earned some Fortune Value and Destiny Points over the last few days, and he had also raised his cultivation by a minor realm.[Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex] was still at the 7th layer, but Gu Changge had still increased his cultivation to the Middle Stage of the Conferred Lord Realm. His speed of advancement was ridiculous when compared to the other Saint-Children of the Upper Realm.He was a supreme villain with a Golden Finger who could increase his cultivation by adding points, so it would be a disgrace if he wasn\u2019t improving this fast.This method of using Destiny Points was nothing short of using a cheat in an online game to rig up your specs!At the same time, Gu Changge had been wondering about the repercussions of having a Dark Fortune. But even after racking his brain, he couldn\u2019t come up with anything.He received no Heavenly opportunity, nor did a Divine disaster strike him down.He concluded that it was only a sign of him being an anomaly, since it didn\u2019t exist among the seven levels of luck:\u00a0\u2018Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple.\u2019In simple terms, Dark Fortune represented an unpredictable variable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Either way, he was still going strong and wasn\u2019t a stupid person. No matter what kind of Favored Child of Heaven he encountered, he would be able to deal with them.Just like Ye Chen. Even though the Heavenly Dao protected him, he was still almost played to death by him. Even Su Qingge, the goddess he loved and admired, broke her relationship with him (Ye Chen) and became his (Gu Changge) woman.Worse still? Ye Chen\u2019s final reliance, his master named Yan Ji, would also belong to him sooner or later.This feeling of having everything under control was more than wonderful!Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but smile as he thought about this, and descended to the lower floor of the flying boat.It was far more livelier here than above.Many young talents of the Eastern Wilderness gathered together and conversed among themselves \u2014 some discussed the Dao, while others sparred on the spot to see who was better.\u201cYoung Lord, what has brightened your mood today?\u201dSu Qingge naturally followed after Gu Changge when he moved around. Her flawless, gem-like eyes blinked in surprise as she watched Gu Changge\u2019s refreshing smile.Gu Changge rarely showed such a natural smile. On ordinary days, not only were his thoughts deep and elusive, but he also liked to evilly mess with her. It had become the norm for her to be teased and harassed by Gu Changge.He was no honorable man!\u201cSomething good, naturally!\u201dGu Changge casually replied, and then asked, \u201cTell me about the Middle State\u2019s forces that are worthy of attention.\u201dOver the last few days, Gu Changge discovered that Su Qingge\u2019s Fortune Value had increased by a lot, and she was close to crossing the 400 Points mark. As a result, his Fortune Value had also increased.Was there really something as good as gaining Fortune Value without doing anything?This discovery made Gu Changge ponder for a long time. In the end, he concluded that Su Qingge was still hiding some secret from him, and that\u2019s what led to the increase in her Fortune Value.After all, could people really increase their Fortune Value without doing anything?Still, Gu Changge didn\u2019t bother asking for the reason as it had nothing to do with him. Who didn\u2019t have some secret of their own?Su Qingge nodded when she heard his question. She had deliberately collected a lot of information about the Middle State, and was waiting for Gu Changge to ask her about it.\u201cThe Middle State is divided into eight domains, and the Central Heavenly City is the most prosperous among them all. The event that the Great Xia Dynasty\u2019s third prince is holding will also take place in the Central Heavenly City\u2026\u201d\u201cThis level of Dao Assembly can\u2019t match up to Your Excellency\u2019s identity, so Your Excellency can simply watch it as a show of entertainment!\u201dChu Xuan added from the side. He had rushed over after he saw Gu Changge coming to the lower floor of the flying boat.Many young prodigies in the distance laughed with some bitterness when they head his words. They had waited a long time for such a gathering, desiring to become famous all over the world by showing their talents at once.\u201cI am not interested in this Dao Assembly.\u201dGu Changge didn\u2019t hide his lack of interest. He had come to the Middle State for his own matter\u2026to cut another leek, the newly appointed Favored Child of Heaven.As for watching a bunch of brats from the Lower Realm discuss the Dao? He couldn\u2019t be bothered about that. He would be making a fool out of himself if he deigned to show interest in such a low-level farce.\u2026\u2026[Middle State, Central Heavenly City, Ancient Lin Family.]As one of the Ancient Families of the Middle State, the Ancient Lin Family had stood tall in the Central Heavenly City for more than tens of thousands of years.The Ancient Lin Family came into being some thirty thousand years ago, at the hands of their ancestor who broke through the Void and successfully ascended to the Upper Realm to become a mythical existence.It was precisely because of this background that the Lin Family could become one of the strongest Ancient Families of the Middle States. So much so that even some Great Dynasties and Holy Lands had envy towards their deep heritage.At this moment, in a deeply hidden Ancestral Hall of the Lin Family, a candlelight flickered and the light in the surroundings dimmed. At the same time, a certain disturbance could be heard.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWhy did the Great Elder suddenly summon us to the Ancestral Hall?\u201dA group of old people gathered together with serious and doubtful expressions. The current head of the Lin Family was no exception.All of them were the highest-level figures of the Lin Family. They had strong cultivation bases and supreme authority. A single stomp from them could cause the world outside to tremble.But now, all of them stood dumbfounded in the Ancestral Hall. They were shocked by the sudden summon from the Great Elder who had long entered seclusion.The Great Elder hadn\u2019t showed himself for nearly ten thousand years, and he had an unfathomable cultivation base from what they knew. Many had even thought that he had perished amidst his seclusion.They couldn\u2019t help but rack their brains to think about what matter had taken place for the Great Elder to summon them all so suddenly?The situation puzzled everyone, and they all watched the spirited and childlike old man in front of them.That old man was none other than the Lin Family\u2019s Great Elder!\u201cWe pay our respects to the Great Elder!\u201d\u201cWe wonder why the Great Elder has summoned us and asked to wait here?\u201dEveryone showed their puzzlement.Generally, unless some earth-shattering event took place, they would never gather together all at once. Could it be that the Great Elder\u2019s cultivation base had another break through, and he wanted to try his hands at Ascension?Seeing that everyone had arrived, the Great Elder finally opened his mouth with a strange expression on his face.He looked extremely excited, to the point that his body couldn\u2019t stop trembling. But soon, he forced himself to calm down, and spoke with a quivering voice, \u201cToday\u2026I felt our Ancestor\u2019s aura\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the Ancestor is returning!\u201dThe entire Ancestral Hall quietened down as soon as those words fell.[WHAT?!]Everyone was stupefied for a moment, but then shock covered their faces immediately afterwards. They were in a state of disbelief.They wondered if they had heard wrong?Their Ancestor, who Ascended to the Upper Realm some thirty thousand years ago, was actually returning?How could that be?One had to know that Ascension was difficult, but Descending was almost impossible! It was almost ten thousand times difficult to Descend, then to Ascend, and that made the process nearly impossible.Or had their Ancestor reached an even more incredible cultivation realm over in the Upper Realm? To the point that he could trave through the Void at will, and had come down to bring them all to the Upper Realm?As this thought crossed their minds, their excitement soared and their complexion turned bright red.There Ancestor was a legend from thirty thousand years ago!All of the Lin Family\u2019s glory and power today could be attributed to that Ancestor\u2019s contributions!They had no doubt in what they heard \u2014 after all, the Great Elder had said so himself. None of the gathered people could suppress their joy and excitement.\u201cGood! Great! Awesome! With the Ancestor\u2019s return, our Lin Family is bound soar higher and higher\u2026\u201d\u201cHahah! I must let all the forces of the Middle State know that our Lin Family\u2019s Ancestor has returned!\u201d\u201cAt that time, the Great Xia Dynasty, the Buddhist Holy Land, and all the other forces will have come here and pay their respects! Our Lin Family\u2019s momentum is bound to shake the entire Middle State, and no one will be able to contend with us!\u201dTheir words of praise satisfied the Great Elder, and he nodded while stroking his beard. With a laugh, he said, \u201cGood, good, good! Inform the others in the family to prepare a welcome celebration for the return of our Ancestor!\u201d\u201cOur Lin Family will surely see an even more glorious time!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I missed a total of 5 Chapters, and I am completely intent on making up for them over these few days by increasing the release rate by +1.I hope you can understand my difficulty.Enjoy!Without a shred of surprise, the news regarding the return of the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s Ancestor from the Upper Realm spread throughout the Central Heavenly City like wildfire. Even with the people of the Lin Family doing their best to suppress the news, it still spread to every corner of the Realm.The entire Central Heavenly City was like a cauldron about to explode!Countless forces and cultivators were shocked. Just what kind of existence was the Ancestor of the Ancient Lin Family? He was a powerhouse of the False God Realm who shattered the Void and Ascended to the Upper Realm some thirty thousand years ago!Yet now, he had returned?One could hardly imagine the terrifying sensation caused by this news. Countless people couldn\u2019t sit still, especially the various hegemonic forces of the Middle State who immediately dispatched uncountable spies to investigate the truth of the matter.This matter was originally suppressed as the region was soon going to hold the Dao Conference of the Heavenly Geniuses of the Realm. Innumerable forces were paying attention to this Conference, so they decided not to dwell too much on this matter. But the subsequent actions of the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s members confirmed the authenticity of this news to the world.The Lin Family members that were dispatched outside the Family rushed back, as if waiting to welcome their Ancestor on his return. Many people had a keen mind and observation, and they soon recalled the rumors that spread from the Eastern Wilderness regarding the descent of a Young Lord who had come from the Upper Realm.Many had considered that to be nothing more than a rumor\u2026but now? It shook the people to their cores. Could the return of the Lin Family\u2019s Ancestor be related to that matter?Even the overlords such as the Great Xia Dynasty, the Buddhist Holy Land, and the Yin-Yang Holy Land also sent their people to the Ancient Lin Family to request an audience with their Ancestor when he appeared. They were also forces who had their Ancestors Ascend to the Upper Realm, so they were very keen on knowing the whereabouts of their Ancestors.For a while, all of the Middle State surged with dark undercurrents.At the same time, an extremely magnificent flying boat galloped through the sky and soon landed in the Central Heavenly City\u2019s vicinity. There were already people from the Middle State who had arrived to pick up the geniuses of the Eastern Wilderness for the Dao Conference.Gu Changge and Su Qingge, on the other hand, went to the family that Old Ming had created years ago.\u2026\u201cAn ancestor who returned from the Upper Realm?\u201d\u201cAncient Lin Family?\u201d\u201cThis could be a good place for me.\u201d\u201cWhat a pity, though\u2026\u201d[In an ancient city of the Middle State.]A youth with a cold face and a bronze ring on his hand stopped in his tracks when he heard the sudden news, but soon, his eyes flashed with hatred when he thought deeply about the matter.The youth was none other than Ye Chen who had traveled to the Middle State after leaving the Eastern Wilderness.Along the way, not only had he not suffered much, but he had instead received a lot of opportunities and benefits. His cultivation base even made a breakthrough and he reached the Transcendent Realm in one fell swoop.In addition to that, he even got acquainted with the Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land, and the two of them became sworn brothers at first sight.It could be said that he had already washed away the humiliation he suffered back in the Eastern Wilderness.\u201cThe Ancient Lin Family has a deep heritage, but you have a lot of secrets that need to be protected, or someone will discover an abnormality with you and you will be targeted!\u201dA cold voice sounded from the ring and warned Ye Chen.Yan Ji, still dressed in red as always, sat cross-legged in the void, and advised Ye Chen against what he was thinking.Although a rift had appeared between her and Ye Chen due to the previous events and happenings, she couldn\u2019t help but turn a little soft-hearted and forgive Ye Chen after he constantly apologized for his behavior.Still, no matter how she persuaded Ye Chen to let go of his hatred towards Gu Changge, he wouldn\u2019t listen and thought that she had some impure motives behind her constant nagging.Yan Ji felt helpless at this result.\u201cMaster, please don\u2019t worry! I still have more important matters to deal with, so I will most certainly not go to the Ancient Lin Family!\u201dYe Chen replied while looking down at a broken ancient relic in his hands. It was an ancient fragment he accidentally obtained from a small stall, and it seemed to record a route to an ancient ruin.After many days of deciphering, he found that the ancient ruins weren\u2019t too far away from the city he was currently in.\u201cNo one has discovered these ancient ruins before, so there must be a lot of opportunities in there. When I break through to the Great-Transcendent Realm, I will be able to fight even existences of the Saint Realm! At that time, Gu Changge and Su Qingge, you sons of bitches\u2026\u00a0Heh-heh!\u201cYe Chen\u2019s lips showed a sneer as he thought about the future. In his opinion, Gu Changge could only be in the Saint Realm, no matter how overpowered he might be.Once he broke through to the Great-Transcendent Realm, he would be able to easily suppress Gu Changge\u2019s so-called prodigious talent with his own ultimate talent. After all, Gu Changge was nothing more than a spoiled bastard who attained his cultivation base through consuming pills and Heavenly treasures from a young age.A spoiled\u00a0\u2018genius\u2019\u00a0like Gu Changge could never compare to someone like him, who had gone through countless life and death experiences and battles.With those thoughts in his mind, Ye Chen strode out of the ancient city and headed towards the ancient ruins.[VILFIC: such delusions\u2026someone tell him.]\u2026[At this time in a Lin Family courtyard.]An ordinary-looking boy with a stone-cold face busied himself in concocting some sort of medicine. He held a cattail fan in his hand and gently fanned the flame under the medicinal pot to control the flame\u2019s size and intensity.\u201cI am still short of three herbs that are required to refine this [Origin Tempering Spirit Pill]! To think that I, the strongest God King of my generation, would see such desperate times where I don\u2019t even have enough medicinal ingredients to temper my weak body\u2026\u201dThe youth coldly muttering to himself was none other than Lin Tian.Immediately, he shook his head and said, \u201cWhatever! Since Heavens have given me another chance at life, I won\u2019t let such minor matters dissuade me from reaching greatness.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, I must build up this body\u2019s foundation that\u2019s down in the dumpster and can\u2019t even reach the Spirit Sea Realm.\u201dHis face burned as he recalled how he had boasted he would break through the Spirit Sea Realm within half a day, yet now, he didn\u2019t even have enough medicinal materials.Lin Tian couldn\u2019t help but sneer in his heart. It wasn\u2019t his fault!\u2018What use is me being a Direct Disciple of the Ancient Lin Family if I can\u2019t even get enough medicinal materials? It seems that this kid\u2019s position in the family isn\u2019t all that great\u2026\u2019\u2018Not only was this kid bullied, ridiculed, and looked down upon\u2026he didn\u2019t even have the right to ask for medicinal ingredients like the others. What a pitiful life\u2026\u2019Lin Tian felt upset when he recalled his clansmen\u2019s eyes full of shock and disbelief when he went to ask for some medicinal ingredients a while ago.He, a once-mighty God King, was questioned and thoroughly looked down upon no matter where he went or what he did! And that made him extremely unhappy.If he had his original strength, he would have long slapped all those bastards to death.It was merely performing alchemy, yet they said that the wouldn\u2019t be able to do it? They also mocked him by saying that giving him any ingredients was nothing more than a waste of materials.Lin Tian\u2019s face turned ugly as he recalled the abusive looks and words thrown at him. When had he, the dignified Heaven Slaughter God King, ever suffered such humiliation?At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from the courtyard\u2019s entrance. Two people, a boy and a girl around fourteen or fifteen years old walked in.The boy frowned as he saw Lin Tian busy himself with refining some concoction and said, \u201cLin Tian, what are you doing here?! The Patriarch has summoned all the family members to pay their respects to the Ancestor!\u201d\u201cEven a waste like you wants to refine pills now? Have you taken a look at your reflection in a puddle of piss? Shouldn\u2019t you first learn the basics of Alchemy before jumping into the act?\u201dThe girl next to the boy couldn\u2019t help but mock with a sneer.Someone who couldn\u2019t even be bothered with cultivation had suddenly changed his mind and started refining pills\u2026they thought that Lin Tian had finally lost his sanity!Although he was the Patriarch\u2019s most unwanted son, the unfortunate fact that he was a direct descendent of the clan couldn\u2019t be washed away. He couldn\u2019t be absent when the Ancestor himself was coming back to the Family!Lin Tian\u2019s expression soured as soon as he heard their taunts. He was a God King, for fucks sake! He was a mighty existence worshipped by countless mortals!Pay respects to the Ancestor?What kind of dog-shit was that? Was he even worthy?\u201cI heard there\u2019s a Young Lord who came along with the Ancestor! That Young Lord seems to have some terrifying background, and even the Ancestor has to be respectful before him\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard that too! The origin of that Young Lord is something we can\u2019t even imagine\u2026\u201dThe two didn\u2019t pay any attention to Lin Tian\u2019s expression, and kept talking to themselves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hopefully, the sky clears up soon and the cold gets a bit better as well.Everyone, stay safe and take care of your health!Lin Tian\u2019s face turned ugly as he listened to the conversation of the two who completely disregarded his existence.The Ancient Lin Family\u2019s Ancestor?An unfathomable Young Lord?What crap were these toys?Before him, all the existences of the Azure Realm were nothing more than wooden toys he could move around at whim. The strongest in the Realm was nothing more than a False God Realm, too! Before him, a mighty God King, False God Realms were nothing more than ants that could be squashed under his pinky.Lin Tian simply dismissed their existence and decided to go back to his own matters.\u201cI am not interested in meeting any Ancestor or whatever.

Lin Tian wasn\u2019t like this on normal days. Had he gone crazy or what?

He really didn\u2019t want to go, but matters related to the Upper Realm concerned him very much.\u2018Whatever! I will just go and join them. I have to see who is the Ancestor of this Ancient Lin Family\u2026\u2019Lin Tian\u2019s expression changed and he silently followed after the two as soon as he reasoned about the matter in his mind. Upon seeing him walking behind them, the two couldn\u2019t help but laugh out. What happened to the guts he showed just a moment ago? Sure enough, the Patriarch\u2019s threat could tone him down!\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he say he wasn\u2019t interested?\u201d\u201cIt seems he still knows his place and understands that he\u2019s nothing without the Lin Family\u2019s background backing him up!\u201dThe two in the front ridiculed in soft voices, but Lin Tian heard every word that rolled off their tongues. His complexion turned even more unsightly, and a murderous intent rose from the depths of his eyes. Still, he held back! He did, indeed, need his identity as a Lin Family\u2019s descendant.He couldn\u2019t reveal his origin!The two youths in front of him didn\u2019t know that they had walked down the path to Hell, and a Yama was watching them with great intent.Although Lin Tian\u2019s cultivation base wasn\u2019t all that high right now, he could still easily make minced meat out of the two using methods from his previous life.\u2026.[In the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s Great Hall]Many powerful figures stood around inside the Hall. Their mighty spirit energy surged around, and Divine lights loomed around their figures. Sacred Ruins intertwined around them, showing the profound heritage of the Ancient Lin Family at its best.Many more members of the Ancient Lin Family also stood outside the Hall. Most of them were youths \u2014 male and female \u2014 who were shrouded in holy halos. They were the elite geniuses of the Ancient Lin Family, and they were quite famous in the lands of the Middle State.All of them watched on with great curiosity and excitement, but none dared to make a sound. After all, the people inside the Hall were the highest-ranking Elders of their Family!Even the Great Elder who had gone into seclusion thousands of years ago, and was considered to have died amidst his seclusion, had come out to personally receive the newcomers!Just who was the young man in black sitting at the head seat and drinking tea with an indifferent expression?The maid next to him was a breathtaking beauty, too! Just like a Fairy who had descended from the Ninth Heaven!Even their legendary Ancestor, who had Ascended to the Upper Realm, was behaving like a respectful underling!Just who was the youth?It was all an unimaginable matter for them \u2014 something they had never imagined to see in all of their life.\u201cOld Ming, you should deal with your matters without worrying about my presence.\u201dGu Changge said with a casual smile. He was very interested in the progression of the current situation, as everything had happened without him even needing to put on a false show of might.When their flying boat had arrived above the Lin Family\u2019s estate, a large group of Elders respectfully greeted them from below and introduced themselves as the descendants of the Ancient Lin Family.Afterwards, Gu Changge and his group were invited to the Lin Family\u2019s estate by that group.Since he had nothing better to do at the moment, Gu Changge decided to take it as a stroll outside and agreed.It was Old Ming who explained to him that it was because of bloodline resonance he invoked that the Ancient Lin Family had found out about their arrival when they neared the Middle State, It was because of that matter that all of the Elders had personally come out to fetch them.Although he didn\u2019t speak much, the grand welcome from his descendants put a bright smile on Old Ming\u2019s smile. Especially when it was all done in Gu Changge\u2019s presence!He didn\u2019t want his Young Lord to see ruins when he brought him to his Family in the Middle State. This trip to the Lower Realm was an opportunity for him, after all.If they were still in the Upper Realm, then, with his status in the Gu Family, it would be impossible for him to get close to Gu Changge, let alone do something for him that would be worth remembering.\u201cMy Lord, I can\u2019t fulfill your command this time. No matter how happy this old slave is, this old slave dares not leave your side!\u201dOld Ming said with a wry smile.Of course, he knew that Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t blame him for his current half-joking tone.Today, Old Ming\u2019s heart was bursting with joy after he saw that his descendants were not only having a great life, but they had also become one of the greatest Ancient Family of the Middle State.He wasn\u2019t this courageous on normal days, and would never use a joking tone in front of Gu Changge.\u2018Old slave?\u2019Their Ancestor actually referred to himself as an old slave?!Everyone who heard those words took in a deep, cold breath. Their pupils shrunk, and their hearts shuddered. The youngsters outside couldn\u2019t help but open their eyes wide.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dGu Changge responded with a smile. He would naturally not mind such trivialities. He decided to take his leave and stroll around, instead of standing between the young wanting to reminisce with their old.\u201cQingge, accompany me on a stroll.\u201dGu Changge put down his tea cup, and stood up to leave.He had an indifferent-yet-amiable expression, without the slightest hint of arrogance, and that gave the people around him a more approachable feeling.But everyone knew full well that the man in front of them was a supreme existence who couldn\u2019t be bothered about their insignificant existence. The amiable aura around him was nothing more than a sign of his goodwill that he showed to give face to Old Ming.\u201cQiuhan, you are familiar with the area, so why don\u2019t you accompany the Young Lord and show him around?\u201dThe Patriarch of the Lin Family suddenly spoke up and gave a command to his daughter who was standing near the Hall\u2019s door.Old Ming couldn\u2019t help but give him a look of approval. This descendant had great foresight!\u201cUnder\u2026 Understood, Father!\u201dLin Qiuhan immediately responded with a trembling voice. Her nervousness was through the roof at the moment.Originally, Gu Changge didn\u2019t care much about having a guide, but when he took a look at the one who would accompany him, his eyes lit up.In front of him stood a stunning beauty!With a thin layer of make up to accentuate her features, she looked like a Fairy. Her skin shimmered under the light, and her hair fell behind her and flew around like clouds. The loose robe she wore could not hide her tall and curvaceous figure that made heat rise inside a man\u2019s body.Of course, what truly distinguished her as a phoenix among the pheasants was the massive Fortune Value she possessed!\u201cSister\u2026\u201dLin Tian, who had just arrived at the scene, was taken aback as soon as he saw what happened. He tightly clenched his fists, and his emotions went into a violent turmoil.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

An uncomfortable feeling of rage rose from the depths of his heart, and he subconsciously blurted out a call for Lin Qiuhan even though it wasn\u2019t his intention.Lin Tian knew this was caused by his Predecessor\u2019s obsession, and it was his body\u2019s instinctive reaction to seeing the scene in front of him. After all, Lin Qiuhan was the only one who treated his Predecessor with kindness according to his memories.Although she would put on a harsh and severe stance, she was sincerely good towards him in reality. She didn\u2019t treat him with indifference or despise, like the others in the Family.The previous Lin Tian had always held an unspeakable kind of love for Lin Qiuhan!It was just that his sister was too outstanding, while he, himself, was a down-and-out piece of waste without any talent\u2026that thought humbled him from the bottom of his heart. Now that such a scene appeared in front of his eyes, the Predecessor\u2019s obsession obviously gave him a feeling of unwillingness and discomfort.Still, the predecessor was gone and the one today was the Heaven Slaughter God King. To solve his Predecessor\u2019s obsession, he spent a lot of effort over the last few days.A few days ago, he shocked everyone by pointing out the errors in the demonstrations done by the Extreme Dao Academy\u2019s teachers, and even helped them fix their errors. This helped him improve his image in Lin Qiuhan\u2019s mind as well, and she believed that Lin Tian had finally changed his mind and decided to work hard on his cultivation and studies.Liu Qiuhan was pleased by his sudden change. She believed that her relentless persuasion had finally taken effect, and her younger brother had understood her worries.Lin Tian was more than satisfied with this result. It was merely the first step of his grand plan of making Lin Qiuhan see him in a completely different light. How hard could it be for a mighty God King like him to capture a lass\u2019s heart?But right now, one could see frost oozing out of Lin Tian\u2019s eyes.Who the fuck was that bastard, and where did he pop out from? He wondered.How dare he try to get close to his goods?He was courting death!But soon, Lin Tian\u2019s eyes constricted as his gaze landed on the ethereal beauty behind the young man. Although a veil covered the woman\u2019s visage, he could tell she was a thrilling fairy from the outline of her face.Of course, the most important aspect regarding the woman was her special physique.\u2018Could it be the mythical [Mysterious Nine Yin Maiden Physique] that\u2019s mentioned in the ancient records\u2026\u2019\u2018The legendary Physique that\u2019s said to make the highest tier Human Cauldron?!\u2019\u2018To think I would come across such a Physique in a place like this!\u2019Lin Tian immediately lowered his head to prevent anyone from discovering the abnormality in his expression. He wasn\u2019t too sure about his conjecture, and needed more time to observe and pass a final verdict. After all, such a Human Cauldron Physique could move even the hearts of the mightiest Gods!\u2018Could this guy be the Young Lord they were talking about? I never thought he would have such great luck\u2026\u2019\u2018What a pity, he met me!\u2019Lin Tian thought to himself, and soon, his complexion returned to normal. No one around him had discovered anything abnormal about him. What surprised him, though, was that\u00a0\u2018esteemed\u2019\u00a0young man looking at him with a strange light in his eyes?A very faint chill passed through Lin Tian\u2019s body, but that disappeared as soon as it appeared\u2026it was like an illusion.\u201cLin Qiuhan? That\u2019s a nice name.\u201dGu Changge complimented. His good looks only appeared more enthralling as he chuckled, and it brought him gazes of admiration from many of the women standing outside the Hall.It was the so-called attraction to an Immortal visage that everyone felt.\u201cMuch\u2026Much thanks for your praise, Young Lord!\u201dLin Qiuhan\u2019s face flushed slightly and she spoke with a stutter.Although she was a teacher on regular days, and would radiate a majestic and iron lady-like aura as she taught the disciples at the Extreme Dao Academy\u2026even she couldn\u2019t help but feel tense in the current situation.The handsome youth in front of her was a favored God-child who could even make her Ancestor act like a slave in front of him. No matter who it was, they would be able to tell he was from a terrifying background. It would be strange if she didn\u2019t feel nervous when talking to him even after knowing all that.\u2018THIS DAMNED OBSESSION\u2026\u2019Lin Tian screamed in his heart when he saw the hateful scene in front of him. Feelings of jealousy and unwillingness welled up in his heart.The others in the hall, however, only chuckled somewhat and kept quite about the scene that transpired. Not just Old Ming, but many people in the Ancient Lin Family also wanted Lin Qiuhan to be fancied by Gu Changge.Old Ming himself was a divine existence in their eyes, so Gu Changge could only be an even more shocking figure if they thought about the matter with some reason.\u201cThis one isn\u2019t a Demon who will eat you, so why are you so nervous, Miss Lin?\u201dGu Changge\u2019s expression did not change, nor did his smile disappear as he spoke up again. Still, he turned his gaze away from Lin Qiuhan and looked towards his front and said, \u201cI will have to trouble Miss Lin to take me and Qingge for a walk now.\u201dIn his heart, however, he was thinking about something completely different.Life sure was unexpected. He was planning to look for the new Favored Son of Heaven, yet the Favored Son of Heaven appeared in front of him himself. It was as if someone had delivered him pillows when he was thinking about sleep.It also just so happened that he was quite interested to know where Lin Qiuhan\u2019s massive Fortune Value was coming from. Two hundred points in Fortune Value weren\u2019t something ordinary people could possess. The youth, the new Favored Son of Heaven, who was sneakily looking at him had a Fortune Value of five hundred.Gu Changge wondered what template this one was cut from?\u2026.The tense atmosphere in the Hall finally subsided after Gu Changge took his leave. Not just the Patriarch and the Elders of the Lin Family, but even the Great Elder felt nervousness in his presence. After all, it was their first time interacting with an existence from the Upper Realm, so how could they not be nervous?\u201cAncestor, what is the identity of that Young Lord? \u201dAfter a while, the Great Elder asked with tumultuous emotions. He held curiosity, and many other emotions that couldn\u2019t be put into words, as he respectfully probed.As soon as he raised his question, the youths standing outside the Hall also pricked their ears and carefully listened to satiate their own curiosity. Even Lin Tian, who had been secretly paying attention to Old Ming, put on a solemn expression as he intently listened on.He could feel an aura similar to his own when he was at his peak from the Ancestor of the Lin Family who had descended from the Upper Realm. At the same time, he felt that the aura had something wrong with him and it wasn\u2019t similar to what he should sense.[1]This matter greatly confused him.There was nothing about Gu Changge\u2019s identity that Old Ming needed to conceal from his descendants, so he gently smiled and said, \u201cMy Lord\u2026he will be the one leading an Immortal Orthodoxy and the mighty Gu Family in the future! If you are lucky enough to receive My Lord\u2019s fancy, then you will immediately transform into a dragon from an inferior carp. At once, you will leap from the mortal world and step into the Ninth Heaven\u2026\u201d\u2013 \u2013 \u2013[FOOTNOTES]Lin Tian feels that Old Ming is a God King just like he was once upon a time, but the aura he feels from Old Ming isn\u2019t the same as what a normal God King should have, and that\u2019s what confuses him. Old Ming can\u2019t bring out and show off his true aura due to the Lower Realm\u2019s restriction, so that might be the case as Lin Tian has never been to the Upper Realm, so he doesn\u2019t know and probably has never met someone else who descended from the Upper Realm and was suppressing their aura.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gu Family?What kind of concept were they?Who in the world dared to call themselves Immortal?Only a force that had existed since time immemorial and dominated the world could have such a right, right?Old Ming\u2019s words took away the breath of everyone from the Ancient Lin Family, and great shock rose from the bottom of their hearts.No wonder even their Ancestor referred to himself as\u00a0\u2018old slave\u2019\u00a0in front of the Young Lord. With such a background, serving him was also a great honor. Their awe and reverence they held towards Gu Changge in their hearts grew deeper.With their Ancestor\u2019s servant-like relationship with the Young Lord, they estimated that they and their Ancestor were nothing before him.\u2018That youth has such a terrifying background?\u2019Lin Tian\u2019s expression changed a bit and he felt that the matter had become somewhat tricky. But soon, his expression calmed down again. Since they had descended upon the Lower Realm, they had to abide by the laws of the Lower Realm. For a God King like him, it wouldn\u2019t be all that hard to deal with a kid still wet behind his years!It would have been hard if they were in the Upper Realm, but down here\u2026Of course, the main reason was the fact that he felt that the youth who had descended from the Upper Realm held exactly what he was looking for. If he wanted to rise to the top, he would most certainly have to cross paths with this youth.Old Ming started talking about his past experiences to his descendants, while Lin Tian quietly left the place with bright eyes. He planned to follow Gu Changge to see what he was up to. He worried that Gu Changge might do something untoward to Lin Qiuhan.\u2026.The clear springs flowed, and spiritual mist floated around.Lin Qiuhan nervously walked ahead with sweat-covered palms, guiding Gu Changge around on his random stroll. She couldn\u2019t calm herself no matter how hard she tried \u2014 she worried that she might offend the Young Lord by making some untoward action unknowingly.She felt as if she were a commoner chosen by the Emperor as his guide.Gu Changge seemed to be wandering around aimlessly, but he was considering many matters in his mind. Finally, he decided to pass some remarks.\u201cLady Lin Qiuhan, you needn\u2019t be this nervous. Learn from Qingge, not only is not afraid of me, but she has also learned to talk back to me now.\u201dGu Changge said with a casual smile, sounding quite friendly. He couldn\u2019t deal with Lin Qiuhan if she was this nervous all the time.Su Qingge, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes when she heard Gu Changge\u2019s words. Such shameless remarks\u2026she wondered why she wasn\u2019t surprised hearing them from \u2018her\u00a0Young Lord\u2019s\u2019\u00a0mouth.\u201cQingge? Could she be\u2026Eastern Wilderness\u2019s legendary number one beauty? Su Qingge, the Holy Maiden of the Taixuan Holy Land? \u201dGu Changge\u2019s joking tone indeed helped Lin Qiuhan lower her unease and nervousness, and she asked back with great surprise. She had heard some rumors about Su Qingge of the Taixuan Holy Land before. It was said that the Eastern Wilderness\u2019s goddess had left with a Young Lord some time ago.Now she found out that the Young Lord in the rumors was none other than the Young Lord Gu who came to visit them.The number one beauty of the Eastern Wilderness \u2014 she was a woman admired by many youths from many regions close and far, yet now, that very person was right next to her. She looked like Young Lord Gu\u2019s maid at first sight.Lin Qiuhan couldn\u2019t help but feel some complicated emotions well up in her heart, together with an inexplicable feeling of envy towards Su Qingge for some reason.Young Lord Gu had a kind, gentle, and friendly temperament. Even though he was high above, he didn\u2019t give others a sense of contempt and disregard. Not only did he have great personal cultivation, but he was also well-mannered, like a gentleman described in the classics.Lin Qiuhan relaxed a lot after she thought about it like this.She began to take the initiative to introduce Gu Changge to the surroundings with a lovely smile on her face.\u201cOh! I see\u2026\u201dFrom time to time, Gu Changge would nod to her explanation, and even tell her some joke and evoke a burst of clear laughter from her.Their group resembled a group of Immortals walking around in the mortal world, with a handsome gentleman and gorgeous maidens.At the same time, Lin Qiuhan\u2019s impression of Gu Changge kept soaring, and she felt that Gu Changge was a true nobleman. No matter how one looked at him \u2014 be it his conversational skills, his manners, his temperament, or his power \u2014 one would find a sense of magnificence and elegance never seen before in anyone else.As the genius daughter of the Ancient Lin Family, she had come across many a dazzling geniuses. But in front of Young Lord Gu, they all paled like the twinkling\u00a0stars before the radiant sun at high noon.No, to be more precise, they couldn\u2019t compare to him in any way!She even felt that just a word from the Young Lord was enough to speed up her heart and flush her complexion.Gu Changge naturally saw all of the changes happening with Lin Qiuhan. His expression didn\u2019t change, but he felt more and more interest towards Lin Qiuhan in his heart. It was what they called:\u00a0\u2018falling at first sight.\u2019Sure enough, a good face helped you no matter where you went.This was awesome, too, and it saved him a lot of trouble.Afterwards, Gu Changge changed the topic and began asking Lin Qiuhan about herself and the Ancient Lin Family.\u2018Why would Young Lord Gu ask me about me?\u2019His sudden interest in herself made Lin Qiuhan\u2019s heart jump around like a fawn. Could it be that Young Lord Gu had developed a good impression of her?It made her a little flustered and increased her nervousness.\u201cQiuhan is the eldest daughter of my father, and I have various half-brothers and sisters\u2026\u201dBut soon, Gu Changge\u2019s smile relaxed Lin Qiuhan\u2019s heart and she began to introduce her family\u2019s situation to him. Among them, she also talked about the half-brother she worried about the most:\u00a0\u2018Lin Tian.\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but narrow his eyes when he heard his introduction.Here came the familiar words:\u00a0\u2018waste and not interested in cultivating himself.\u2019At this moment, Gu Changge slightly glanced towards a direction and saw a figure that was hiding not to far away.The hidden figure was giving out very faint energy fluctuations. He did his best to hide, but he was still a bit away from completely erasing his presence.The guy who was secretly glancing at him from outside the Hall back in the Ancient Lin Clan must be the Lin Tian she was talking about just now.\u201cOh! Wouldn\u2019t he be unhappy if he heard his elder sister call him a waste?\u201dGu Changge asked with a light chuckle.Seeing that Young Lord Gu seemed to be interested in his, Lin Qiuhan continued to elaborate, \u201cEveryone knows about this matter. Even though I want to defend him, I have no means to do so.\u201d\u201cLittle Tian\u2026his mother passed away when he was young, and our father also didn\u2019t treat him well. In addition, he has no talent for cultivation, nor is he interested in it. Although he\u2019s a direct descendant of the Family, he actually has no place in it.\u201d\u201cWhat a pitiful child. But he\u2019s quite lucky to have a sister as beautiful as you looking after him!\u201dGu Changge praised with a gentle smile.\u2018Young Lord Gu called me beautiful?\u2019His sudden words of praise stunned Lin Qiuhan, and her complexion turned beet red out of joy and shyness.\u201cLittle Tian\u2026he\u2019s a sensible child. After my constant nagging, he has finally started to turn over a new leaf! He\u2019s begun to study and cultivate\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan said with a relief-filled smile.\u2018Hoh! He has recently started to study and cultivate?\u2019Intrigue filled Gu Changge\u2019s smile when he heard those words, and he immediately came to a realization:\u00a0\u2018Waste turned over a good leaf overnight trope. It was either a mighty figure taking over the body of a trash, or a trash regressing back to the past!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gu Changge had no doubt that the person hiding in the dark was Lin Tian. Only after he noticed his presence did he quickly turn around and leave.That wasn\u2019t the mindset ordinary teenagers were supposed to have.\u201cIt just shows that your persuasion was effective, and that he knows to empathize with his sister. Someone who can\u2019t cultivate is truly no different from garbage in this world. What\u2019s more? You were only doing it for his own good!\u201dGu Changge gave her words of recognition with a handsome smile.He continued talking casually, wanting to ask Lin Qiuhan more about Lin Tian\u2019s situation. As his elder sister, Lin Qiuhan must be the one who knows Lin Tian best.Naturally, Lin Qiuhan didn\u2019t know Gu Changge\u2019s intentions. Instead, she felt moved by his words. She never thought she would hear words of comfort from Young Lord Gu!After that, she continued talking about many other things about Lin Tian.Gu Changge smirked and continued conversing with her. At the same time, he reaped as much information from her as he could.A piece of information that roused his interest was the fact that Lin Tian had recently started taking interest in Alchemy, and even asked Lin Qiuhan for various medicinal ingredients. At the same time, he had also become proficient in some ancient formations \u2014 a few days ago, he had pointed out the mistakes of several elders, and shocked everyone.Gu Changge had almost figured out the ins and outs of this Protagonist\u2019s template, and even thought up some contingency plans. This new Favored Son of Heaven\u2026he seemed easier to deal with than what he had imagined.Now that he didn\u2019t have to worry about receiving some existence-obliterating Fortune Backlash, Gu Changge could use more methods to deal with these Favored Children of Heaven.\u201cI never thought Young Lord Gu would understand me\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan felt her heart move.\u201cEven Little Tian can\u2019t understand me normally, and thinks that I am too harsh on him.\u201dLin Qiuhan felt helpless when she said this.Still, she felt gratified. She felt that Lin Tian had finally turned over a new life, and all her worries over the last few years hadn\u2019t gone to waste. Even better, what many members of their Family couldn\u2019t understand, Young Lord Gu did in their first meeting.This gave birth to a strange emotion in her heart.Lin Qiuhan had cultivated for more than twenty years, and only now did she understand what the words,\u00a0\u2018heart skips a beat\u2019\u00a0meant. She felt her heart skip a beat in their very first meeting, even though her heart had never been moved by the young geniuses who pursued her relentlessly over the years.Gu Changge naturally saw through Lin Qiuhan\u2019s heart. After all, he had already expected this.With his status as a mighty and handsome man from the Upper Realm, together with his conversation skills and insights from his previous life, even a smart woman like Su Qingge couldn\u2019t escape his grasp. So how could Lin Qiuhan, someone with a far simpler mindset, not fall into his hands?He required no effort to deal with her!Starting with her was not only easier, but also more interesting than dealing with Lin Tian.Su Qingge, who watched the entirety of the show from the sidelines, deepened her understanding of Gu Changge. He was indeed a sinister man who loved to play with peoples\u2019 hearts.\u201cIt\u2019s good that little brother Lin Tian has decided to turn over a new leaf now. He must have been a pearl covered by the dust before! He must be blessed with great talent to be able to point out the mistakes of even Elders in just a few days\u2026\u201dGu Changge suddenly spoke with an emotional sigh, making it seem that his words were purely out of admiration. He was acting.\u201cHow could Little Tian be a pearl covered by dust? As for his talent\u2026he couldn\u2019t even reach Spirit Sea Realm before\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan couldn\u2019t help but refute with a smile, but soon, her words stopped. She was stunned, and felt that something was wrong, but she couldn\u2019t put her finger on what that was!\u201cEh? How did he perform Alchemy if he couldn\u2019t even cultivate to the Spirit Sea Realm? Could it be that little brother Lin Tian came across some ancient inheritance? When I was in the Upper Realm, I heard about some elusive ancient inheritances like that. The cultivators can inherit them even before the Spirit Sea Realm. It seems that little brother Lin Tian is a man greatly favored by the Heavens!\u201dGu Changge couldn\u2019t help but mutter as if he was greatly surprised.Lin Qiuhan couldn\u2019t see much right now, but she will certainly reach certain conjectures after he pointed her in the \u2018right\u2019\u00a0direction.Seeing Lin Qiuhan lose herself in her thoughts with a deeply focused expression, Gu Changge decided not to add any more hints. He understood that he had to lead her moderately, so he smiled and kept quiet.\u2026.[In another place at this time.]After Gu Changge sensed his trail, Lin Tian decided to take his leave and no longer followed after them.Right now, he had an ugly expression, and deep jealousy rising in his heart. Of course, it was because of his Predecessor\u2019s obsession with his sister.Currently, Gu Changge was too strong for Lin Tian, but that was only because he had recently reincarnated. Lin Tian couldn\u2019t correctly estimate Gu Changge\u2019s current limits because of his measly cultivation base.Still, the most unexpected matter to him was his sister\u2019s behavior. His sister, who was harsh to him on normal days and put on a majestic front, actually showed such a meek and bashful expression in front of another man.Worse? It was their first meeting, too!Such a scene made Lin Tian\u2019s blood boil, and he felt as if someone had robbed him of something precious that belonged to him. He couldn\u2019t help but clench his fists, so much so that one could hear his bones creak.Good thing that his state of mind couldn\u2019t be destroyed with just this much. After all, his cultivation in his previous life wasn\u2019t in vain, nor a fluke.Soon, Lin Tian calmed himself and resolved in his heart,\u00a0\u2018This so-called Young Lord Gu is really sinister and not a kind person. He shows a gentlemanly front, but he\u2019s most definitely not a gentleman no matter how I look at him. I must ask Lin Qiuhan to be cautious of him, so she doesn\u2019t fall into his sinister trap.\u2019\u2018Since you have decided to offend me, don\u2019t blame me for smacking you down!\u2019Before, because of the Physique of the woman following Gu Changge, he was still wondering whether or not to deal with Gu Changge. But now, he had decided. He now had a good reason to deal with him.It was Gu Changge who provoked him first, not him!\u2026.Night came in the blink of an eye.Great tremors went through the Central Heavenly City due to the sudden return of the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s Ancestor from the Upper Realm, and that caused a stir everywhere. Countless cultivators discussed the matter.The pieces of news spread from the Ancient Lin Family to various parts of the Middle State, causing massive waves in every ancient city.All the major forces were shaken to their cores, and they sent their descendants and disciples to visit the Ancient Lin Family.Right now, Gu Changge stood by the window with his hands radiating immortal lights and ruins. He looked very mysterious as the dim moonlight illuminated his visage, and his black dress fluttered by the cold wind. His expression was calm and indifferent, as he was lost in his thoughts.He had already figured out the plots and cliches about the newly-crowned Favored Son of Heaven, Lin Tian. He was most definitely a mighty figure who fell somehow and his remnant spirit reincarnated by taking over the body of a waste.He had already judged that Lin Tian didn\u2019t have any knowledge of the future, so he couldn\u2019t be a Regressor. This made it easy for him to deal with Lin Tian.Of course, what surprised Gu Changge the most was the fact that when he was outside the Hall, this dude intently stared at Su Qingge for a few moments for some reason.Isn\u2019t it a villain\u2019s duty to covet other peoples\u2019 women?How come the Favored Sons of Heaven started taking on that mantle now?Seems like Lin Tian was quite anxious for his death.Leeks are supposed to have a leek\u2019s self-awareness, but he was overreaching.[VILFIC\u2019s Crib]If you are already a Supporter, or intend to support me on \u2018Buy Me a Coffee,\u2019 please make sure to use your real email.

It\u2019s already up.\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013Here\u2019s a small introduction to the two leeks that we have seen until now.Ye Chen \u2192 Ye Chen is a down and out Protagonist who was a genius when young, but soon, his Cultivation no longer increased for reasons he couldn\u2019t understand, and he lost all his status and respect. Because his cultivation became stagnant, people who once respected him became to ridicule him and called him trash, scum, and an insult to their great Ye Clan. His fianc\u00e9e broke her engagement with him which humiliated him greatly, so he set up a three-year agreement with the girl, and swore to the Heavens that he will return the humiliation to her and everyone who humiliated him.When he was at his lowest point in life, the ring his non-existent mother left for him shone with great light and a heavenly beauty appeared out of the ring. The beauty told him that the reason his cultivation didn\u2019t increase is because the beauty was taking away whatever Spiritual Energy he was collecting for his cultivation to heal her own remnant spirit. It was all thanks to him that she could finally awaken. To apologize for taking away his cultivation and sending him down the spiral of humiliation and scummery, the beauty promises to help him achieve greatness by taking him as his disciple. The beauty was a supreme mighty figure when she was alive, and she came from the Upper Realm. She fell into the Lower Realm after a bunch of bastards encircled her and attacked her to kill her. There\u2019s also a chance she was a supreme Alchemist with grand status.It\u2019s at this point that Ye Chen\u2019s luck turns around and he goes on his path of world domination and beauty conquest, where he was supposed to face slap everyone, b!tch slap his ex-fianc\u00e9e, and trample on all the other genius and young masters. At the end, Ye Chen would have a Harem consisting of his master, Su Qingge, and other Favored Daughters of Heaven blessed with great fortune.BUT\u2026he met Gu Changge and got himself screwed.Lin Tian \u2192 Lin Tian is a down and out Protagonist who was a mighty God King from another Lower Realm. When he reached the peak of God King Realm and decided to Ascend to the Upper Realm to reach even more grandness, the Heavenly Dao decided to frick him over. He met a Black Hole or something, and the Black Hole ripped him apart and only left a part of his soul. That tiny part of his soul roamed around the Universe and ended up in another Lower Realm which had a civilization that is far behind the Lower Realm he came from. In this Lower Realm, he took over the body of a trash who can\u2019t cultivate.Lin Tian was supposed to use his knowledge from his past life to soar to the Heavens in a single leap. He will use his knowledge to face slap everyone who looked down on him, impress his sister to pound her honey pot, subdue various Favored Daughters of Heaven blessed with great fortune. He would soon become a False God which is nothing compared to his previous cultivation of the God King realm, and Ascend. Just like that, he will keep soaring even in the Upper Realm. By the end, he will have a massive harem that will include his sister, his old disciple, some random female master, and whatnot. He will be a supreme existence in the Upper Realm worshipped and feared by the Supreme Orthodoxies, Families, Sects, and Kingdoms.He might also become the foster son of some mighty figure, too. His knowledge of Alchemy, Formations, and other secondary occupations is far ahead of whatever the Lower Realm of Ancient Lin Family has developed. All of them are like a bunch of hill-billies in front of the mighty God King he was.BUT\u2026he met Gu Changge and will be getting himself screwed.That\u2019s all, in case anyone was wondering about the background of the two\u00a0\u2018antagonists\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Were he a real threat, Gu Changge would never allow him to live this long. He would obliterate him as soon as he offended him \u2014 he would never show mercy and let his adversary grow up.Be it Ye Chen or Lin Tian, they were nothing more than a bunch of leeks and handymen for his use, even if they were the Favored Sons of Heaven. He would reap them one after the other.Gu Changge was no foolish man. He would never allow a threat to his life exist for long; he would most certainly nip them in the bud.Since times immemorial, the reasons villains died were:\u00a0\u2018talking too much and not killing off Protagonists out of arrogance.\u2019He wouldn\u2019t fall into the same traps as the many who died before him. He will keep his mouth shut and not let arrogance cloud his judgement. He might not be omniscient and omnipotent, but his knowledge would be enough to save him.What\u2019s more? Slowly playing the Favored Children of Heaven to death in the Lower Realm wasn\u2019t all that hard. He didn\u2019t even need to kill them off at first sight since Ye Chen and Lin Tian weren\u2019t even a threat to him.Gu Changge was more than happy to take things the way they were. After all, his own Destiny Points went up as he slowly squeezed the Fortune Value of the Favored Children of Heaven. It would be too boring if there weren\u2019t these minor restrictions.Since he transmigrated and became the villain, it\u2019s only natural that he does what a villain does best!In addition, he had learned from the System that killing a Favored Child of Heaven after completely reaping their Fortune Value had some incentives. After he dried all of their Fortune Value, killing those Favored Children of Heaven would trigger some\u00a0\u2018Heavenly Rewards\u2019\u00a0from the System.Heavenly Rewards\u2026those words didn\u2019t sound all that bad. At least, Gu Changge felt his heart surge.It was because of this that Gu Changge allowed Ye Chen to move around, or it wouldn\u2019t be all that hard for him to find Ye Chen with his spiritual mark on his Master.Gu Changge simply decided not to deal with him immediately. He was waiting for Ye Chen to be his treasure sniffer who will open the ancient ruins and find the location of the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd].He would use him to the last moment.After all, that was the real purpose behind his descent to the Lower Realm.While Gu Changge was lost in his own thoughts, a knock on the door sounded from outside.\u201cQingge, go and open the door.\u201dGu Changge couldn\u2019t help but raise his eyebrows when he sensed the person who had arrived, and then commanded Su Qingge who was busy reading some ancient book not far away from him.\u201cYes, Young Lord.\u201dSu Qingge put down the book in her hands, and lightly walked towards the door.Outside the door stood Lin Qiuhan dressed in a light blue dress. A light pink adorned her gorgeous face, compounding her beauty. In her hand, she held a small tray of food with a covering on top of it\u00a0that exuded an alluring aroma.\u201cThese are some pastries Qiuhan made just now. If Young Lord Gu feels hungry, he can use these to relieve his appetite at night.\u201dLin Qiuhan said to Su Qingge with a flushed face.Her mind was in a mess, and she didn\u2019t know what she was thinking when she especially went to make these spiritual pastries. Cultivators at a certain level didn\u2019t even need food for sustenance and could easily live on Spiritual Qi alone.It just so happened that she was good at cooking, so she thought that she should make something and deliver it to Gu Changge.\u201cUnderstood. Thank you for your hard work, Miss Lin. There was actually no need to come here personally at this time. Qingge will thank you in \u2018my Young Lord\u2019s\u2019\u00a0stead!\u201dSu Qingge put on a flawless-yet-ceremonial smile on her face, and spoke with a cold tone. She didn\u2019t even hide her hint towards Lin Qiuhan, and intentionally emphasized the\u00a0\u2018my Young Lord\u2019\u00a0when she spoke.The innocent beauty in front of her had only met him once, yet her Young Lord had already caught her heart. This made Su Qingge wonder if she should give a hint to the girl and save her from falling into this pit of fire with her?But soon, she remembered that she would only suffer more at Gu Changge\u2019s hands if she did do that, so she gave up.Obviously, Lin Qiuhan didn\u2019t understand the hint hidden in Su Qingge\u2019s words. She wasn\u2019t as quick-witted and cunning as Su Qingge, after all.\u201cI will have to trouble Holy Maiden Qingge then; I won\u2019t bother Young Lord Gu\u2019s rest.\u201dLin Qiuhan\u2019s nervousness increased the longer she stood there, so she quickly handed the tray to Su Qingge and rushed away as if escaping from someone.\u201cYou met her once and she\u2019s already fallen\u2026Young Lord\u2019s ability to play with peoples\u2019 hearts is becoming more and more sophisticated.\u201dSu Qingge walked back inside and said after arriving next to Gu Changge. At the same time, she uncovered the tray that held the cake made by Lin Qiuhan.[Hum!]Immediately, a soothing aroma burst out, and a sacred glow brightened the surroundings. Various runes and scenes flashed around the pastries, and it could be seen that the ingredients used to make them weren\u2019t all that simple.\u201cMiss Lin\u2019s craftsmanship is pretty good; you must learn from her, Qingge!\u201dGu Changge didn\u2019t bother responding to Su Qingge\u2019s previous remarks. He was in a great mood right now, and couldn\u2019t help but praise the pastries after taking a few bites.\u201cSince Young Lord thinks so highly of her, then why not take Miss Lin away with you? Wouldn\u2019t that be much easier?\u201dSu Qingge said.Gu Changge glanced at her face after hearing her words, and said with a smile, \u201cQingge, are you jealous? I never thought you would be the jealous type; it doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d\u201cYou look quite unpleasant like that!\u201dSu Qingge shook her head and responded, \u201cMy Lord\u2019s thoughts are too deep and elusive \u2014 Qingge has enough self-awareness and knows her place. It\u2019s already hard for me to receive some of your attention, so what use would it be for me to be jealous?\u201dAlthough her words were calm, they couldn\u2019t mask the minor grievance in her heart.\u201cSince when did you speak what you don\u2019t mean?\u201dGu Changge couldn\u2019t help but chuckle.\u2026.Lin Tian watched Lin Qiuhan coming from a certain part of the Lin Family\u2019s estate from the distance. That direction happened to be where Gu Changge\u2019s resting quarters were prepared.This woman\u2026just what was she doing, going to his place in the evening?Rage appeared on Lin Tian\u2019s bitter face, and he couldn\u2019t help but clench his fists.\u201cLittle Tian, what are you doing here? That aside, where did you go this afternoon? Why couldn\u2019t I find you anywhere in the Family estate?\u201dLin Qiuhan\u2019s expression had been a mix of joy, bashfulness, anxiety, and many other complex emotions. But as soon as she saw Lin Tian, she suppressed her emotions in a hurry and questioned him with a stern tone.Lin Tian gritted his teeth. His heart burned with jealousy and envy, but he forced himself to calm down, and asked back, \u201cSister, it\u2019s so late in the evening\u2026why did you come out at this time? Did you go to visit that Young Lord Gu?\u201dLin Tian himself couldn\u2019t describe the emotion he felt in his heart at this moment. If he didn\u2019t resolve this obsession soon, then it will start affecting his state of mind, and he might end up doing something stupid.He had to find a solution for his Predecessor\u2019s obsession.As for Lin Qiuhan\u2026as soon as she heard his words, she panicked. It was as if someone had caught her red handed in the midst of some evil deed. Still, she maintained her stern appearance in front of Lin Tian, and said, \u201cStop bothering about my matters, and focus on your cultivation!\u201d\u201cThat man with the surname Gu is a sinister man; don\u2019t be deceived by his false appearance. I can tell at one glance that he\u2019s a wolf who tricks women, so you have to open your mind and see the threat, Lin Qiuhan.\u201dLin Tian said with a stern face of his own, and even raised his voice and directly called out Lin Qiuhan\u2019s name. He couldn\u2019t let Lin Qiuhan sink any further in Gu Changge\u2019s trap, even if he had to use some tough means.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Young Lord Gu?\u201dLin Qiuhan couldn\u2019t help but frown upon hearing his words, and her expression worsened. Since when did she fall so low that even Lin Tian could step over her head?What\u2019s more? She had first-hand experienced Young Lord Gu\u2019s personality, and believed that he was humble, polite, and as gentle as a gentleman could be. Even though he came from a prestigious background, he didn\u2019t give her the feeling of interacting with someone high above.\u201cDon\u2019t talk bad about Young Lord Gu! If you could be one percent as good as Young Lord Gu, then I wouldn\u2019t need to worry so much about you!\u201dLin Qiuhan snarled. She thought that Lin Tian was overthinking everything.\u201cWhy are you so stupid? Why can\u2019t you understand what I am telling you?!\u201dLin Tian\u2019s rage soared, and he spoke with great annoyance. But even after he said his piece, Lin Qiuhan didn\u2019t appear to have a change of mind. Just what kind of drug had that bastard with the surname Gu fed her? He wondered.\u201cJust what\u2019s wrong with you? Lately, you have been acting too weirdly! Even if Young Lord Gu isn\u2019t a good person, what would he desire from me? Why would he harm me?\u201dLin Qiuhan didn\u2019t know what else to say to Lin Tian, so she threw her own questions at him, and immediately turned to walk away.Lin Tian, on the other hand, was stunned and stood rooted to his spot.That\u2019s right\u2026why would Gu Changge target her?Halfway through her walk, Lin Qiuhan recalled that she still had questions for Lin Tian. How did he perform alchemy? How did he suddenly increase his cultivation? And where was he this afternoon?Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t see anyone when she turned around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, she really thought there was a problem with Lin Tian after listening to Gu Changge\u2019s words during their stroll.Lin Tian had no talent or idea about cultivation just a few days ago. Even if someone urged him and offered help, he wouldn\u2019t move an inch. Yet now\u2026what had happened to him?What brought such changes to his character? Why did he suddenly change into a troublesome and arrogant fellow? How did he learn Alchemy so suddenly? And how did he point out the mistakes in the Elders\u2019 teachings?Was there an expert hiding behind him who taught him everything? Or could it be\u2026Lin Qiuhan shuddered a little and no longer thought about these matters.Unfortunately, Lin Tian had disappeared by the time Lin Qiuhan turned around.All of this left her in a daze, so she couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u2018Whatever, he\u2019s probably angry after listening to my rebukes once more; he must have returned to his own courtyard. I will ask him about these matters tomorrow\u2026just what happened to Little Tian?\u2019Lin Qiuhan shook her head, and decided to leave the matters be. For now, she should return to her own resting quarters and take care of her personal matters. She still hadn\u2019t looked through her students\u2019 submissions.At the same time, the thought of seeing Young Lord Gu again tomorrow appeared in her mind. Immediately, her mood brightened and she looked forward to the arrival of the next day. She wished for time to pass as soon as possible. It would be thrilling if tomorrow could come fast.Once Lin Tian and Lin Qiuhan\u2019s dispute ended, a System prompt sounded in Gu Changge\u2019s mind just as he desired.[Ding! Lin Qiuhan has developed doubts about Lin Tian\u2019s sudden change in temperament. Lin Tian lost 50 Points of Fortune Value. Host received 250 Destiny Points!]Sure enough, everything was moving according to his wishes.He had read more than a few web novels in his past life, and knew all these cliches and tropes like the back of his hand. He had also read a lot of novels where the villain\u2019s triumphed, so Gu Changge naturally knew how to squeeze all of the Fortune Value of a mighty figure who reincarnated like Lin Tian.First, he will develop a rift between the Protagonist and the person closest to him. Second, he will pit his family against him. And lastly, he will reveal the matter of him taking over the Predecessor\u2019s body for his\u00a0\u2018evil\u2019\u00a0gains\u2026Everything was under Gu Changge\u2019s control, and Lin Tian will never be able to make any moves. If he guessed correctly, Lin Tian will be making his move any time now \u2014 he will never stand at the spot and let someone trample him without a fight.Gu Changge\u2019s curiosity peaked when he wondered what kind of method Lin Tian will use to deal with him?Would he try assassinating him? He would be smashing his head into a brick wall.Would he try to poison him? That wouldn\u2019t work either.Then\u2026there was only one method left:\u00a0\u2018Lin Tian will use some kind of forbidden technique.\u2019\u2026.Lin Tian returned to his courtyard with a gloomy expression clouding his face. Lin Qiuhan\u2019s words had greatly humiliated him. He, the Heaven Slaughter God King who reigned supreme from East to West in his previous life, never imagined in that he would suffer such extreme humiliation.Even a woman looked down on him now?What did she mean she wouldn\u2019t be worried about him if he was one percent as good as that guy with the surname Gu?Those remarks enraged Lin Tian. And since he, a mighty God King, was enraged, he must naturally wash this shame with the blood of his adversary.\u2018It\u2019s good that I went to prepare all the materials in the afternoon\u2026\u2019\u2018Although the power won\u2019t be one-ten-thousandth of my peak, it will be more than enough to deal with a brat like him.\u2019\u2018Hehe! Gu bastard, you brought this upon yourself\u2026\u2019Lin Tian coldly thought to himself.As a person from the Upper Realm, Gu Changge was continuously under the protection of the Lin Family\u2019s Ancestor, so he couldn\u2019t use ordinary means to deal with him. What\u2019s more? His current strength wasn\u2019t enough to harm Gu Changge either.So the only way Lin Tian thought about was using a forbidden technique![VILFIC: lmao, bruh I ded.]The reason he held so much confidence in this method was simple:\u00a0\u2018he held an ancient forbidden technique in his arsenal!\u2019It was an extremely weird and incomprehensible technique that brought forth a demon from an unknown realm, who could kill the target without leaving a trace. He had used this exact technique to injure even a God King of the same cultivation realm as his own!Although he couldn\u2019t exert his true might right now, dealing with a youth like Gu Changge wasn\u2019t difficult.Of course, the forbidden technique didn\u2019t come free of cost! It burned the caster\u2019s life force as sacrifice to the demon that will be summoned.Lin Tian couldn\u2019t care about the price right now. After all, he could easily make up the loss of his life span when he achieved his mighty cultivation base in the future.\u2018By soaking the [Nine-Nine Soul Incense] in the Blood Essence of eight different poisonous beasts, and then mixing it with the bone marrow of three different beasts will open a gateway to this Lower Realm and let in the demon. Once the gateway is opened, I will need to use [Mortal Flesh Incense] and [Mortal Ghost Money] to communicate with the demon and build a bridge between us\u2026\u2019[VILFIC: I was thinking of outright skipping this nonsense that adds no value, but here it is just in case.]Lin Tian was busy preparing the materials for this forbidden technique in the afternoon, and that was why Lin Qiuhan couldn\u2019t fin him anywhere.As a descendant of the Ancient Lin Family, it wasn\u2019t hard for him to go out and arrange all these materials.Afterwards, Lin Tian recalled the necessary steps to perform the forbidden technique, and placed the various ingredients in different parts of his courtyard. Soon, he began to summon the demon from another realm. Closing his eyes, Lin Tian sat in the middle of the structure, and began to chant obscure words.These materials weren\u2019t simple, and some were even made of skin and bones\u00a0of humans and other races, and they could only be found in the shady black markets hidden in the darkness of the ancient cities.His predecessor had left quite an amount in savings, so Lin Tian could afford these materials without issue.[Hum!]Soon, colorful runes flickered around, and an eerie atmosphere covered the entire courtyard. If someone were to break in at this time, they would be frightened out of their wits. The sight was simply too frightening.[Rustle!]As Lin Tian\u2019s chanting intensified, a scarlet wind blew around him. Locks of red hair appeared out of thin air and floated above the earth, radiating a cold and sinister aura.Though, it was strange that the sinister aura only appeared inside the courtyard, and no one outside could see it\u2019s presence. The courtyard appeared calm and desolate under the dim moonlight, as if something had isolated it from the outside world.\u2018As expected, it isn\u2019t easy to execute a forbidden technique of this level with my current strength\u2026\u2019Beads of sweat flowed down Lin Tian\u2019s face. Although his expression was still firm, one could see that casting the forbidden technique had put immense burden on his existence.In the next moment, an even more sinister and freezing cold aura enveloped everything inside the courtyard. The runes that previously flickered with light turned pitch black, and intertwined with each other to surround everything.Faint, smoke-like shadows fell from the sky and rose from the earth.\u201cTake his life \u2014 obliterate his true soul!\u201dLin Tian commanded the smoke around him. At the same time, he recalled Gu Changge\u2019s appearance in his mind.\u201cI am willing to pay with fifteen years of my life span!\u201dSoon, Lin Tian felt something rip apart the very essence of his life. At the same time, a faint connection with something unseen formed in his mind. He wobbled weakly, and couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. After all, he had sacrificed the very essence of his life for this.But soon, he recovered his mentality and confidently said,\u00a0\u2018Even if you escape death, you won\u2019t escape turning into a vegetable!\u2019This kind of demon from an unknown realm was the trickiest to deal with. An encounter with them basically resulted in the destruction of one\u2019s soul, resulting in instant death.Even if the target survived somehow, they would end up as mindless vegetables for the rest of their life.The sinister wind arrived quickly, and just as fast disappeared, too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt a vague fluctuation in the void around him as soon as Lin Tian targeted him. He could hear a tumultuous storm, as if thousands of horses galloped towards him.After that, a sinister and gloomy ripple surged in his surroundings, and he felt the familiar breath of a demon.\u2018It seems that he did exactly what I expected from him; it\u2019s just that this forbidden technique is a little\u2026\u2019Intrigue filled Gu Changge\u2019s smile.[Hum!]A dark brilliance flashed past his pupils. The Innate God inside his Sea of Consciousness\u2019s [Innate God\u2019s Temple] opened his deep and indifferent eyes, too! A jet-black aura surged from him like a thick black fog, appearing mysterious and immeasurable.\u2018You are still too wet behind the ears for a mighty reincarnator! Such a measly trick can do nothing to me.\u2019The smile on Gu Changge\u2019s face disappeared and his indifference took over once more.He didn\u2019t even need to rely on his [Devil Heart]! The [Innate God\u2019s Temple] alone was a primordial talent that could triumph over anything. And after he contaminated his [Innate God\u2019s Temple] with his demonic nature, it had become even more unafraid of anything that might come at it.In simpler terms:\u00a0\u2018a demon of this level was nothing more than soup for his soul.\u2019\u201cMyriad Demon\u2026\u201dGu Changge\u2019s face turned stone-cold, but he soon glanced at Su Qingge who was soundly sleeping beside him. He didn\u2019t want to disturb her.In the next moment, a black glow covered his palm and horrible demons intertwined in his hands. It was as if a peerless demon was resurrecting, wanting to swallow everything in its wake.Gu Changge thrust his palm into the void. A cold air surged forth, and he heard the shrill screams of some horrified demon. In the next moment, he pulled back strands of black smoke that trembled with sheer terror.Gu Changge\u2019s Innate God took a step forward and breathed in, immediately swallowing the smoke as if feasting on a goblet.[Kacha! Crack!]Soon, the sounds of someone chewing on flesh resounded. A large number of demons screamed in horror and despair, but they couldn\u2019t escape their fate of getting swallowed in the Innate God\u2019s belly.Gu Changge visibly felt his soul strengthen by a bit. He could also feel a hint of Lin Tian\u2019s life span nourishing his being.Within a blink, the void returned to peace as if nothing had happened there before.[Ding! Lin Tian\u2019s lifespan is greatly reduced. Lin Tian lost 150 Points of his Fortune Value. Host received 750 Destiny Points!]A System prompt sounded inside Gu Changge\u2019s mind, but he didn\u2019t care too much about the announcement.\u2018Isn\u2019t this no different from playing himself to death? This newborn Favored Son of Heaven must be trying to commit suicide! I haven\u2019t even done anything yet, and he\u2019s already taken such a massive hit\u2026\u2019Gu Changge thought with a playful smile.\u201cMy Lord, please forgive this slave\u2019s sin. This old slave isn\u2019t strong enough to protect you, so this old slave hopes My Lord will mete out punishment!\u201dAs soon as Old Ming \u2014 who was guarding outside the resting quarters \u2014 felt the disturbance of the void, he rushed about. His complexion looked extremely ugly, and he couldn\u2019t stop panicking out of horror. He never thought someone would be courageous enough to attack his Lord in the dead of the night.What\u2019s more? They used such a filthy trick!Old Ming couldn\u2019t help but sweat when he thought that it all happened inside the domain of the Family he had left behind.Were his Young Lord unable to deal with this attack\u2026Old Ming could hardly imagine the consequences. He feared that even ten thousand deaths wouldn\u2019t be enough to get him pardon![Hum!]Gu Changge took a step forward and appeared outside the hall with a calm expression.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, a method like this isn\u2019t enough to harm me. On the other hand, I want to know who did it? Who in the Lower Realm has such a method?\u201dGu Changge looked calm and undisturbed. In his heart, however, he cackled a bit over the situation. At the same time, he decided not to directly mention Lin Tian\u2019s name.After all, he wasn\u2019t supposed to know the identity of the descendants and disciples of the Ancient Lin Family since he had only interacted with Lin Qiuhan today. It would be too arbitrary if he mentioned the name of the one who did it.Of course, Gu Changge wanted the Lin Family to find the attacker themselves. Lin Tian must be suffering from a backlash just about now, and shouldn\u2019t be able to run anywhere.He simply needed to sit and watch a good show.He had thought that the Favored Son of Heaven this time would be a tad bit more interesting, but he turned out to be an utter disappointment that was abandoned by his Heavenly Daddy in the blink of an eye.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but feel bored.He was simply too strong, so these weak Favored Children of Heaven couldn\u2019t do anything against him. What\u2019s more? He didn\u2019t need to worry about a Fortune Backlash anymore, so these Favored Children of Heaven were truly like ants that he could stomp to death at any moment.\u201cSince I have already solved the forbidden technique, the person who performed it must be suffering from a rebound.\u201d\u201cThis old slave will go and investigate immediately. I will certainly find the attacker and give an explanation to you, My Lord!\u201dOld Ming felt his heart move after he realized that Gu Changge truly didn\u2019t blame him. He was stunned by the generosity and immediately promised to apprehend the adversary no matter what.Gu Changge nodded and returned to his place.\u201cMy Lord, did something happen outside?\u201dSu Qingge asked with a puzzled expression on her face. She was asleep a while ago, but some disturbance woke her up.\u201cNothing much; you can sleep in peace.\u201dGu Changge said.At the same time, Old Ming summoned the Lin Family\u2019s higher ups, and the entire Lin Family went through a tremendous storm. Everyone felt terrified.The Elders and the Patriarch of the Lin Family even turned pale from fright.Everyone set out to search for the assailant. No one had the guts or desire to sleep tonight, now that something so big had happened against Young Lord Gu!A forbidden technique like that wasn\u2019t something ordinary people could get in contact with. That was something very clear to everyone. They all prayed that it wasn\u2019t something done by one of their own descendants, or they wouldn\u2019t be able to bear the burden!\u2026.Under the dim moonlight, Lin Tian felt that something had gone wrong as soon as he felt the connection between himself and the Heavenly Demon disappear.\u201cNot good\u2026What happened?! Backlash? I am receiving a backlash?! Why is this happening?\u201dLin Tian couldn\u2019t contain his shock \u2014 he never expected such a turn of events. His complexion turned pale and he spewed blood. His hair greyed at a rapid speed, and his skin wrinkled. It was as if he had aged a dozen years in a moment.His entire being turned so weak that it looked as if a gust of wind would blow him away.The moment the forbidden technique\u2019s connection shattered, Lin Tian had felt the terror of that bunch of demons he had summoned. It was ultimate dread that he felt, as if he had come across the greatest demon among the demons, no, he had come across the Emperor of all Demons, the Lord of the Demons himself.The source of their fear was Gu Changge.\u201cWhy on earth did this happen?!\u201d\u201cThat bastard with the surname Gu is still alright, so I definitely can\u2019t stay in the Lin Family anymore. If they find me like this\u2026\u201dLin Tian\u2019s complexion changed drastically. A moment ago, he was a teenager, yet now, he had turned into an older man. Anyone could see there was something wrong with him.Even a disguising technique wouldn\u2019t help him at this time. The experts of the Lin Family would be able to find out his origin was damaged just by looking at him.Soon, Lin Tian\u2019s complexion turned uglier than before. He heard the sound of footsteps outside his courtyard, and realized that the entire Lin Family was in a turmoil right now.The people of the Lin Family had completely sealed the ancient city they resided in. A large number of cultivators also appeared high above in the sky and suppressed every inch of land with their majestic auras. They were prepared to thoroughly investigate every single person who evoked their suspicion.Lin Tian felt his heart turn cold. His anxiety was getting to his head right now.\u201cCould it be that I, a mighty God King, would fall in a place like this? No, I am just a waste in the Lin Family, so they shouldn\u2019t be suspicious of me this soon\u2026\u201dHe forced himself to calm down, and started thinking of a way to salvage his situation.Right at this time, Lin Qiuhan\u2019s anxious voice sounded from outside his courtyard, \u201cLittle Tian, something major happened, so Father has summoned everyone right now! Come out, we must go there immediately\u2026\u201dWith that, Lin Tian\u2019s heart sank thoroughly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His heart kept sinking.What could he do at a time like this?Rush out? No, he would be caught red-handed on the spot!He was in a sorrowful state right now. His origin had been damaged, and he had also received a violent backlash.To begin with, how could he rush out when he couldn\u2019t even walk straight?Lin Tian couldn\u2019t help but feel a deep sense of despair. The despair was no different from what he felt when he shattered through the void and tried to Ascend, but met a spatial rift halfway through his Ascent and had his existence almost obliterated.He felt that exact despair and powerlessness in his heart again.Will he really reach his end tonight? He couldn\u2019t accept that! After finally receiving a chance at resurrection, instead of reaching the peak of his life, he was only falling further down.Lin Tian roared in his heart as unwillingness welled up inside him.But right at this time, it seemed as if the Heavens had heard his despairing call, and he saw a ray of light in the darkness of Hell he was falling down into. A gleam of hope suddenly flashed through Lin Tian\u2019s mind.Suspended Animation!That\u2019s right!He could fake his death and escape from this calamity. Lin Tian was a ruthless man who could do anything if need be. Immediately, he cut off his heart\u2019s vein, and hid his remnant soul in the deepest depths of his Sea of Consciousness using a secret technique.No one should be able to see through his secret technique.After all, the Predecessor\u2019s soul had long perished, and all that was left behind was nothing more than an empty shell. And now that he cut off his heart\u2019s vein, all of the body\u2019s vitality would naturally disappear.And as fate would have it, this secret technique worked in the following manner:\u00a0\u2018after three days, the technique\u2019s effect will disappear, and he will automatically wake up and his heart\u2019s vein will also begin to repair itself.\u2019Even if the members of the Lin Family discovered him, he could use amnesia as an excuse to confuse them.Lin Tian didn\u2019t hesitate to act upon his plan as soon as he thought it through. He gave out a loud cry and sprayed blood from his mouth. His eyes rolled back, and his trembling body fell to the ground.[Bang!]At the same time, someone pushed open the courtyard\u2019s gate and entered.\u201cLittle Tian, what\u2019s wrong?!\u201d\u201cLin Tian\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan and the others were greatly shocked by what they saw in front of them.\u2026.[The next day when the sky had barely brightened up.]Movements outside the hall awakened Gu Changge from his sleep.After devouring that large number of demons last night, as well as Lin Tian\u2019s lifespan, the power of his soul had strengthened to newer heights. That strand of lifespan belonged to a mighty God King, after all, even if he was no longer as strong as he was at his prime. It still contained a lot of power in it.After Gu Changge digested everything, he fell sound asleep. After all, unlike the other cultivators, he didn\u2019t need to stay awake twenty-four-by-seven and sit cross-legged to comprehend and raise his cultivation base. Since he could raise his cultivation base by adding points to his stats, why would he make himself suffer?\u201cMy Lord, a lot of people are waiting for you outside.\u201dSu Qingge was already dressed in a neat and silky soft dress that accentuated her figure. Her exquisite and flawless face shimmered under the faint sunlight.While talking to Gu Changge, she looked outside with some curiosity and doubt.Just what had happened while she was asleep last night?Gu Changge told her nothing, so she was still not clear on the events that transpired. She wondered why all the members of the Ancient Lin Family, including Old Ming, looked afraid and stood outside, respectfully waiting?It wasn\u2019t hard to tell that they were waiting for her Young Lord.\u201cIt seems they have caught the rat.\u201dGu Changge stretched his limbs and replied. Su Qingge couldn\u2019t wait to find out the answer, and asked in wonder, \u201cWho are you talking about, My Lord?\u201d\u201cObviously, I am talking about the one who tried to murder me last night.\u201dGu Changge replied as if it were something insignificant.Even if Lin Tian sprouted wings, he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape from the Lin Family\u2019s encirclement. Gu Changge had no doubts about this matter.\u201cSomething like that happened, and I didn\u2019t even feel a thing?!\u201dSu Qingge was taken aback by his sudden words. Just how soundly was she sleeping last night? How did she sleep through such a massive matter?Or, could it be that her Young Lord had deliberately suppressed the movements to not disturb her? Su Qingge\u2019s heart skipped as she thought about this.A person as aloof and esteemed as Gu Changge could do anything without caring about others. Yet he was so careful and kept her in his considerations? How could Su Qingge not be touched after this realization hit her?These small gestures and acts of care from him were the reason she kept sinking deeper and deeper into his\u00a0\u2018trap.\u2019Gu Changge obviously didn\u2019t know Su Qingge\u2019s thoughts. After all, even he couldn\u2019t claim to read a woman\u2019s mind like the back of his hand.The System, however, told him through a prompt that his Fortune Value had improved. It was from that he could tell that Su Qingge\u2019s heart was surrendering to him more and more.Sure enough, it was as the ancients said:\u00a0\u2018familiarity breeds fondness.\u2019\u201cYou slept like a pig last night, so how would you know?\u201dGu Changge said with a hearty laughter and then walked out. Su Qingge, on the other hand, snorted in response and asked with curiosity, \u201cWas the one who tried to attack you last night that boy named Lin Tian?\u201d\u201cHow could you tell?\u201dGu Changge was a tad surprised by her words.\u201cWell, I felt that there was a problem with that waste called Lin Tian after listening to the dialogue between My Lord and that girl called Lin Qiuhan.\u201dSu Qingge explained.\u201cYou are a smart woman, indeed. I didn\u2019t spoil you all this time in vain.\u201dGu Changge praised.It\u2019s just that Su Qingge still had some questions that puzzled her.Why would that youth called Lin Tian lose his mind and come to attack her Young Lord?Was he tired of living?Sometimes, ignorance and jealousy can really send one to their deaths.Soon, Gu Changge arrived outside and watched the large swaths of faces that belonged to the people of the Ancient Lin Family.\u201cMy Lord, this old slave couldn\u2019t disciple his descendants well\u2026please punish this slave, My Lord!\u201dWith his face covered in guilt, Old Ming stood at the forefront. As soon as Gu Changge appeared, he walked a step forward and knelt down to plead himself guilty.\u201cHave you found the assailant?\u201dGu Changge\u2019s might surged in response, but he made no movement. His face was still as indifferent as ever, and no one could tell whether he was angry or happy.Obviously, he already knew the answer to his question.What\u2019s more? It wasn\u2019t Old Ming\u2019s fault to begin with. Let alone Old Ming, even the people of the Ancient Lin Family would have never imagined that their piece of trash would commit such an atrocity.Still, he couldn\u2019t show that on his face. It would be far more interesting to watch the Ancient Lin Family discover the truth about Lin Tian\u2019s possession, instead of him exposing it himself.\u201cMy Lord, we have found the person, but\u2026\u201dOld Ming\u2019s guilt expounded and he couldn\u2019t complete his words. The people of the Lin Family standing behind him also trembled, and none among them dared to even breathe loudly.The one in the worst condition was none other than the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s Patriarch. Cold sweat covered his forehead and back, and he felt his legs soften under the pressure of what was to come.Once the Young Lord in front of him became enraged, he won\u2019t be the only one going down. The entire Ancient Lin Family and even their Ancestor will suffer.Everyone in the Ancient Lin Family had a mood similar to his own. They couldn\u2019t suppress the panic in their hearts, and stood on their toes as if waiting for the Emperor\u2019s wrathful punishment.Lin Qiuhan was no exception either. Her face was pale, and she had yet to recover from the blow she received last night after reality hit her. She still couldn\u2019t bring herself to believe it all.\u201cOh! What\u2019s the matte? Did something happen to the assailant?\u201dGu Changge asked with interest. He wanted to know what other tricks Lin Tian held in his sleeves. Or were the people before him going to use some excuse and say he escaped? Or will they pretend not to know anything?\u201cLast night\u2026\u201dThen, with great guilt holding him down by his throat, Old Ming began explaining everything that happened last night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFeigned Death; Awaited Resurrection!After searching everywhere last night, they finally found the assailant. It was Lin Tian, the youngest son of the Lin Family\u2019s Patriarch whom no one in the Family liked. He was recognized as the Lin Family\u2019s waste who couldn\u2019t cultivate.The realization shocked everyone at that time.When they rushed into his courtyard, they found Lin Tian with his origin in a damaged state. His face had turned old, and he fell into a pool of his own blood. He had already cut off his heart\u2019s vein, and died.It was impossible for them to figure out the ins and outs of the matter.What could they ask a dead man?The entire Lin Family despaired. They were so desperate that they desired to find someone who could take the blame, instead of the entire family suffering.Everyone hated Lin Tian from the bottom of their hearts!\u201cHe died?\u201dGu Changge was taken aback when he heard their explanation.Wasn\u2019t he supposed to just escape using petty tricks?Gu Changge felt it was impossible. Lin Tian wasn\u2019t truly dead, and he must be pretending to be dead. There were too many secret techniques that allowed one to go into a state of suspended animation in the world, and it wasn\u2019t hard to trick people who didn\u2019t know enough.What\u2019s more? Lin Tian had that overpowered Fortune backing him, so how could he die off so easily?Gu Changge wasn\u2019t surprised that Lin Tian used such a method to pull wool over everyone\u2019s eyes.After all, where could a remnant soul with a damaged origin escape to from the flesh? A gentle breeze would be enough to dissipate such a remnant soul.Besides, how could a Favored Son of Heaven commit suicide?Lin Tian hated him to death, so would he really commit suicide before killing him? If he really did, then he would be a disgrace to all the Favored Children of Heaven.The System hadn\u2019t given any prompt, so Gu Changge was sure that Lin Tian was still alive. He was only feigning death using some kind of secret technique.Did he really think that he, Gu Changge, wouldn\u2019t be able to see through his petty parlor tricks?Various thoughts went through Gu Changge\u2019s mind. The expression on his face didn\u2019t show any change, nor did he utter any response to the ones who stood before him. His silence compounded the anxiousness of the Lin Family\u2019s people, and their hatred for Lin Tian soared further.Even the Lin Family\u2019s Patriarch cursed himself for giving birth to such a scourge.In the past few days, he had felt relieved after listening to Lin Qiuhan saying that Lin Tian had turned over a new leaf. But his actions last night made him piss his pants.[Ding! Everyone in the Ancient Lin Family has developed hatred towards Lin Tian. Lin Tian lost 100 Points of Fortune Value! Host received 500 Destiny Points!]Right at this time, the System\u2019s prompt rang inside Gu Changge\u2019s mind. Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but cackle in his heart a bit.This worked, too?Lin Tian didn\u2019t have a lot of Fortune Value left, and he estimated that whatever he was left with, it was all due to his relationship with Lin Qiuhan.\u201cWe weren\u2019t able to discipline our dog. Please punish us, Young Lord!\u201d\u201cThat Lin Tian secretly plotted and attacked the Young Lord, and it\u2019s all due to our negligence. We are willing to receive your punishment, Young Lord!\u201dEveryone from the Lin Family knelt in unison and spoke with sincerity and fear.Old Ming had clearly explained Gu Changge\u2019s position and background to them. Right now, it would be better for them to confess their sins and honestly ask for punishment, instead of pretending to not be involved.After all, it didn\u2019t matter if they did or didn\u2019t have anything to do with the event.\u201cMight is, indeed, right\u2026\u201dSu Qingge, who was quietly standing behind Gu Changge all this time, suddenly heard a malevolent voice full of admiration in her mind. It was her other soul!Still, her expression remained unchanged.Over the last period of time, she had awakened many memories from her other soul. There were even memories regarding the Upper Realm which confused her a little, so she took up the hobby of reading ancient books to make sense of the scattered information.At the same time, she gradually started to peer upon an ancient cultivation method inheritance that appeared together with those memories.She had kept this secret from Gu Changge. After all, the matter of her having two souls in one body was her biggest secret. She didn\u2019t know how to talk about that kind of matter with someone else.\u201cMy Lord, please punish this old slave for this incident. Although we don\u2019t know the reason behind Lin Tian\u2019s actions, it is a fact that he, as this old slave\u2019s descendant, did commit that heinous act. This old slave is ashamed to even show his face before My Lord anymore\u2026\u201dOld Ming said with deep guilt covering his face.He didn\u2019t know what the heck was that Lin Tian\u2019s deal, nor could he understand how a waste like him who couldn\u2019t even cultivate could use such a vicious forbidden technique.Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t find any proof about someone else using Lin Tian to frame the Ancient Lin Family.\u201cThis matter is too weird. Miss Qiuhan told me about that person named Lin Tian a while ago. He was just an ordinary waste kid who shouldn\u2019t have any ability to harm me, nor would he have the guts to do something like this.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s more? The Upper Realm has many secret techniques that can allow people to take over someone else\u2019s body, and even manipulate their minds. Although this was done by Lin Tian, I know that it has nothing to do with the Lin Family as a whole. Who knows? Someone might be trying to target and frame you because you are the descendants of my followers, and because I am staying here.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s end this here. This Lord isn\u2019t an indiscriminate devil who will hold you accountable for something that\u2019s not your fault.\u201dFinally, Gu Changge spoke up and responded to Old Ming and the people of Ancient Lin Family. His tone was flat, and one couldn\u2019t feel any fluctuations in his aura as he uttered those magnanimous words.He bluntly said that he wouldn\u2019t blame the Ancient Lin Family for all of this.To be precise, he didn\u2019t care about this matter at all. After all, he knew the ins and outs of the matter better than anyone else, and everything was under his control.It wasn\u2019t the Lin Family\u2019s fault that a strong figure took over the body of their waste Lin Tian.Still, he had to pretend that he knew nothing and was simply giving face to the Lin Family. In this way, he could establish his own magnanimity and prestige in front of everyone from the Lin Family, and win their hearts.Although it wouldn\u2019t help him in any way, it wasn\u2019t a bad thing.He could also just consider it as giving face to Old Ming, and that would make Old Ming even more devoted to working for him.Uttering a few words of pardon took nothing from him, and only brought him benefits!\u201cThank you for your kindness, Young Lord!\u201d\u201cYoung Lord is magnanimous and kind!\u201dEveryone in the Lin Family, including Old Ming, breathed in a sigh of relief once they heard Gu Changge\u2019s words. Their hearts relaxed, and they felt immense excitement well up in their chests.Of course, they also guessed that the reason Gu Changge forgave them so easily was because he simply couldn\u2019t be bothered to deal with their Lin Family. That\u2026was just how high above he stood.\u201cThank you, My Lord!\u201dOld Ming wiped the cold sweat on his forehead, and said with an emotional tone.He couldn\u2019t help but feel touched to see that he, a servant, had received so much face from his Young Lord. He felt that he was blessed to be able to work for his magnanimous Young Lord.Lin Qiuhan, by the side, was also taken aback to hear her name from Young Lord Gu\u2019s mouth. She wondered if Young Lord Gu was helping raise her status in the Family?Her face flushed, and she began fantasizing about unknown things.The sadness she felt over Lin Tian\u2019s sudden death had already lessened by a lot over night.\u201cYoung Lord, please rest assured that I will investigate this matter and give you a satisfactory answer!\u201dThe Lin Family\u2019s Patriarch said, and heaved a sigh of relief together with the other Elders. After that, they all began to ponder about the matter.How did Lin Tian die?Why did he mess with Young Lord Gu?And why did a waste like him suddenly turn over a new leaf now only?They had too many doubts that they needed to resolve.Gu Changge gave them a slight nod, and then waved his hands to give them permission to deserve. Keeping them there anymore would bring him no profit.However, he didn\u2019t let them bury or cremate Lin Tian\u2019s body. After all, he was still looking forward to the moment that Lin Tian would\u00a0\u2018resurrect.\u2019If they cremated Lin Tian, then Lin Tian would have truly played himself to death.If they buried him, then everything would go according to Lin Tian\u2019s plot.And since Gu Changge hadn\u2019t thoroughly squeezed him dry, he would never let Lin Tian have his way!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, their daughters and granddaughters couldn\u2019t compare to Lin Qiuhan in beauty nor talent.Lin Qiuhan was also the youngest and most gorgeous teacher in the Extreme Dao Academy.She had hair that flowed behind her like clouds, a pink face, and jade-like skin.She had the capital to be known as one of the most beautiful women, and many in the younger generation pursued her. And now, she seemed to have become an object of desire for this Young Lord, too!This brought great joy to the Elders of the Lin Clan!Many youths, on the other hand, felt sour in their hearts, while the young women felt envy. In short, everyone had complex and different emotions.The Lin Family\u2019s Patriarch also smiled and winked towards Lin Qiuhan. He couldn\u2019t help but heave a sigh of relief.\u2018Fortunately, Qiuhan is a well-behaved and sensible child, so I don\u2019t have to worry too much about her\u2026\u2019If they could get close to Young Lord Gu through his daughter\u2026Patriarch Lin\u2019s heart burst with joy as he thought about the future, and he couldn\u2019t suppress his wide grin.Old Ming also thought that his Lord had taken a liking to his descendant, and he also looked forward to they day they will Ascend back to the Upper Realm and bring Lin Qiuhan along.She was his descendant, so he will also have a blood relative up there.Of course, the main thing was that his Lord took a liking to her.Soon, everyone disappeared from the place.\u201cI have troubled Lady Qiuhan by personally bringing me pastries last night.\u201dGu Changge said with a smile, and then his expression returned to the same indifference and elegance she saw yesterday. The black dress he wore yesterday was replaced by a white dress today, while his long hair were neatly tied behind him. He looked loftier and Heavenly than before.Lin Qiuhan turned absent-minded for a moment.She had to admit that just on the basis of appearance, there weren\u2019t many men in the world who could compare to Young Lord Gu.\u201cDid you like them, Young Lord Gu?\u201dLin Qiuhan was overjoyed by his praise, but then she turned nervous once more. Had she been teaching in school on a normal day, she would have never had such changes in her emotions.\u201cThey tasted great, and there was even a hint of Pill Intent in them. That truly surprisedme!\u201dGu Changge responded with a gentle smile.The reason he asked Lin Qiuhan to stay behind was because she had piqued his curiosity.As a woman related to a Favored Son of Heaven, the amount of Fortune Lin Qiuhan held wasn\u2019t low \u2014 she had over 200 points in her Fortune Value. Generally, cultivators would have a few points of Fortune Value, and some wouldn\u2019t have any. So the number could be called terrific.She was just like Su Qingge, who had around 300 points of Fortune Value at the start, and now she had somehow raised her Fortune Value to over 500 Points.There must have been some changes in her over the last period of time.Gu Changge was well-aware of the fact that Su Qingge was a clever woman who held many secrets of her own. It\u2019s just that he decided not to ask her about them, as he wanted to let Su Qingge confess everything in front of him out of her own volition.As for Lin Qiuhan\u2026apart from her having a gorgeous face and good talent in cultivation, Gu Changge couldn\u2019t see anything special about her.He wasn\u2019t a man who thought with his d!ck. Playing around with her was still alright, but he wouldn\u2019t bring her along like Su Qingge just for these reasons.As for her 200 or so points of Fortune Value? Gu Changge could simply make Lin Qiuhan obsessed with himself and reap benefits like that. After all, if a person wasn\u2019t a Favored Child of Heaven, then all you needed to do to obtain Fortune Value was to make them surrender.As for how much he would gain, it was related to how much they, themselves, had.To put it bluntly, Lin Qiuhan was nothing more than a tool he could use to increase his Destiny Points. That\u2019s how Gu Changge viewed her.Unless she showed some true potential, there\u2019s no way Gu Changge would bring her along.To see if she was worthy of keeping around, Gu Changge decided to test her.\u201cPill Intent?\u201dLin Qiuhan was dumbfounded by the new term. She had never heard of something like Pill Intent before in her life.Sword Intent, Spear Intent, Saber Intent\u2026She had heard about all those, but she had never heard of something like Pill Intent.Su Qingge, however, new a little more and immediately thought of something. She often read ancient books in her free time to widen her horizons, so she had come across this specific term.\u201cThe spiritual pastries you made had some Alchemy-related intent in them, and it\u2019s something not even great Alchemists are able to achieve. Lady Qiuhan, you are truly amazing!\u201dGu Changge smiled when he saw that Lin Qiuhan didn\u2019t understand what he meant.\u201cI don\u2019t know how to perform Alchemy\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan felt embarrassed when she listened to Gu Changge\u2019s praise.She didn\u2019t know Alchemy? Even though she had a terrifying talent for it?!If Lin Qiuhan were born in some major Alchemy-oriented force in the Upper Realm, she would have most likely been hailed as an Alchemy Goddess, and her future would be limitless.Sure enough, the people close to the Favored Children of Heaven weren\u2019t simple. It\u2019s alright though, he wouldn\u2019t let her talent go to waste.Various thoughts floated through Gu Changge\u2019s mind, but his smile didn\u2019t change, and he said to Lin Qiuhan, \u201cLady Qiuhan, it\u2019s no fun standing idle over here, so why don\u2019t you take me around to see the city today?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026okay, alright\u2026\u201cLin Qiuhan was surprised by Gu Changge\u2019s sudden words, and felt her head buzz in excitement.\u2026.Last night, the Ancient Lin Family not only blocked all the entrances and exits of the city, but they also suppressed the environment. Their actions disturbed all the cultivators of their ancient city, and many speculated about the events that transpired.After all, the Ancestor of the Lin Family had returned that very morning, and they were busy with a celebration for that just before. But right as night fell, something major seemed to have happened.The entire Lin Family were like a pack of furious hounds as they searched for someone.Numerous cultivators speculated, and wondered just who had the guts to offend the Ancient Lin Family\u2026to the point that they mobilized their entire Family to capture the perpetrator?After the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s Ancestor returned from the Upper Realm, the Ancient Lin Family had become a force that none could contend against. So the sudden hunt frightened many a cultivator of the ancient city.Finally, they all heard a rumor that someone had used a vicious forbidden technique to frame the Ancient Lin Family by assassinating the Young Lord who had descended from the Upper Realm.When they finally found the murderer, they discovered that it was none other than the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s famous waste of Spiritual Qi, Lin Tian.Many found the piece of news to be too incredible.The incident spread to every cultivator in the city, and the people couldn\u2019t suppress their shock.After all, many in the Middle State knew well the terror of the Young Lord\u2019s origin in the Upper Realm. Going against him was nothing short of courting death.The land of Middle State turned tumultuous once more.\u00a0Even the other domains of the Middle State couldn\u2019t sit still.Many powerful Holy Lands and Dynasties with heritages going as far back as hundreds of thousands of years sent their representatives to the Lin Family with extravagant gifts for their Ancestor and the mysterious Young Lord.The venue of the Dao Conference of the younger generation had also been changed to the ancient city where the Lin Family resided. It was a unanimous decision made by the Holy Lands and the Dynasties.[VILFIC: Holy Lands and Dynasties in the above paragraphs refers to a congregation of all the major forces of the Middle State. They could be Ancient Families, Sects, Holy Lands, Dynasties, or whatever power structure a major power might be based upon.]As for the reason? It was easy for the cultivators to guess if they thought about the news they received from the Eastern Wilderness a while ago.The reason why the Taixuan Holy Land was able to subdue and fend off all the other Holy Lands of the Eastern Wilderness to become the Eastern Wilderness\u2019s absolute overlord was simple:\u00a0\u2018Su Qingge!\u2019One had to accept that Su Qingge,the Taixuan Holy Maiden and the Eastern Wilderness\u2019s renowned number one beauty, was the reason why the Taixuan Holy Land suddenly became the overlord of the Eastern Wilderness.Many Holy Lands and Dynasties wanted to follow in the Taixuan Holy Land\u2019s steps. If their children and disciples could catch the Young Lord\u2019s fancy, they would Ascend to Heaven in a single leap, and even their Ancestors down in their graves would jump to their feet.After all, even the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s Ancestor who had Ascended around thirty thousand years ago had to call himself\u00a0\u2018old slave\u2019\u00a0in front of the Young Lord.This status was far more terrifying than just incredible. It shocked countless forces, and they wanted to get a glimpse of the Young Lord\u2019s face just once.Suddenly, the ancient city where the Lin Family resided turned extremely lively, and one could see a new major faction arrive every new day. There were even people from some ancient races who came out from various Ancient Sacred Mountains. They were figures that even the mighty Holy Lands had to treat carefully on normal days.It was said that the Ancient Sacred Mountains were the ones who truly bordered the Upper Realm. There was even a rumor that they were branches of some Orthodoxies and Native Powers of the Upper Realm.Any creature that walked out of the Ancient Sacred Mountains on normal days would be treated as an honored guest in the major Holy Lands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay[VILFIC\u2019s Crib]Hi there, everyone!I hope all of you are in great health and enjoying my translations of \u201cI Am The Fated Villain!\u201d Before we start the chapter, I have some words to say regarding the release schedule, the missed chapters, and everything in-between regarding myself and the translations I do. It\u2019s long, but do give me some of your time.As you have seen, I started publishing here on [Cyborg-TL] on the 24th of December starting with a release rate of 1 Chapter per day for the first few days, which I later changed to 2 Chapters per day. I have a self-imposed requirement of posting at least 2 chapters every day, as there will be no end to this translation if I simply keep going at 1 Chapter per day.I do translations in my free time, as I do have a job IRL that I need to commit 8 to 9 hours to every day, for now. The round-trip also takes around 60-75 minutes as I need to travel to a neighboring city. Either way, I translate the chapters early in the morning on normal days. I wake up pretty early, around 4-4:30 AM. It takes around 45-60 minutes to do a chapter while keeping a reasonable enough quality. I try to complete translations of 2 chapters at least in the morning, and if I think I can afford a bit more time, I do part of the third chapter. And when I return from work in the evening, I do some more translation if my schedule permits it. I try to stop my use of any devices (laptop/phone) before 9 PM, so I can sleep early and wake up early. It\u2019s also for health purposes.All-in-all, you now know my translation schedule. For a while now, I have been trying to get myself a permit to work from home as I do web development stuff that I can easily do from home. I was working from home until the end of November, when they mandated that I work on-site due to a staff shortage issue and whatever. The issue is somewhat resolved and they have matters in control\u2026so I would like to return to working from home. Travel tears the life out of me, and tires me out more than actual work and the translations I do. On-site also has other problems that result in a bunch of wasted time (which I actually use to throw in a few more words of translation, but don\u2019t snitch on me to my boss\u00a0) for me, which I normally put in other stuff IRL when I work from home.Either way, the workload over the last few days had been at a high, so it became really hard to manage my time. I was going to sleep late at night and waking up late in the morning as well. That all resulted in the no chapters yesterday. Before that, I missed a few days in the start of the month due to bad health. All of these missed chapters will be slowly made up for through this week. The week of 10 Jan to 16 Jan.I have received indications that my request will be approved in the next few days\u00a0\u00a0and I will have more time to focus on everything besides work. I can\u2019t completely leave work, after all, but I do intend to reduce my workload and balance it with the generous donations I receive from everyone. It won\u2019t be easy and it won\u2019t happen immediately, but I will work towards this more balanced future.It\u2019s completely my fault for not informing everyone on the days I can\u2019t translate/publish a chapter, and I understand that I can do better. For this, I have resolved myself to be more active in the Discord server and also set up Discord on my phone (I didn\u2019t have it on my phone before as I only use my phone for work-related matters), so I can send you a prompt update in case there\u2019s something.I will end this here and won\u2019t hold you back any longer by saying this:\u00a0Thank you, everyone, for your continuous Support! It\u2019s your presence, kind words, and continuous love that keeps me going with the translations! I will do my best to provide you with a regular release of your favorite novel, and if I do have to miss a day or something, I will assure that you are informed about that.Thank you,VILFIC!Eastern Wilderness\u2019s Mysterious Genius; Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land!The Ancient Sacred Mountains had a heritage that could be traced back to the earliest civilizations of the Azure Lower Realm. Many cultivators even believed that the Ancient Sacred Mountains even had might False Gods and beyond in endless seclusion. Once they made a move, the entire world would tremble and perspire.Yet now, many from the Ancient Sacred Mountains had also come out into the world, and were mingling and mixing with the others. Some cultivators noticed their tracks and realized that all of them were heading to the place where the Ancient Lin Family resided:\u00a0\u2018Moon-facing Ancient City!\u2019Many speculated about the Ancient Sacred Mountains\u2019 intentions. Perhaps, they were also related to that mysterious Young Lord from the Upper Realm?![Moon-facing Ancient City]As an ancient city that was no worse than the Central Heavenly City in its prestige, and connected many other locations as a hub between them all, the Moon-facing Ancient City had a population of nearly one hundred million.Colorful clouds floating in the sky, and ethereal mist covered everything on the ground. One could see many palaces, pavilions, shops, and restaurants lined side-by-side on the streets of the city. Magical runes and brilliant lights shone everywhere, and cultivators and creatures flew above and around the city with divine lights around their bodies, making the city look extraordinary.As the place where the Dao Conference of the Young Geniuses would be held, it was only natural that the Moon-facing Ancient City attracted the attention of all the cultivators of the realm. Not to mention, there was also a rumor that the Young Lord from the Upper Realm was staying in this very same city.Cultivators from all over the world had come to the city for this reason!The major Holy Lands and Ancient Dynasties had also sent their experts bearing luxurious and extravagant gifts. Not just the Middle State, but even places like the Northern Wilderness and the Western Wilderness, etc. had sent their own Young Geniuses to participate in the Conference to show off their skills.Many people had their own calculations \u2014 it wasn\u2019t shameful to hug the thigh of a mighty figure, after all.\u201cBrother Jin Yang, I haven\u2019t seen you for a while, yet your cultivation has already turned even more unfathomable!\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? Brother Zeng Tian, you are the one who has made real progress! It seems that you have already mastered\u00a0\u2018that\u2019\u00a0supreme skill, no?\u201d\u201cHaha! That was just a fluke, brother, I can never be as good as you.\u201d\u201cIn the time we haven\u2019t seen her, Fairy Chen\u2019s demeanor has become even more ethereal. She truly deserves her place as the leader of the Myriad Flowers Holy Land\u2019s younger generation. Her aura, alone, is enough to suppress all of her peers!\u201dA group of young men and women conversed with each other inside a pavilion. There were handsome and luxuriously dressed gentlemen, and gorgeous and virtuous beauties.The cultivators who watched them all from the outside couldn\u2019t help but show awe on their faces.All of these youths came from extraordinary backgrounds. They were either descendants of some Ancient Family, the Princes and Princesses of an Ancient Dynasty, or Holy Childs of one of the major Holy Lands\u2026none of them were simple!There were many mighty auras hidden in the dark, protecting them from the shadows.It was hard to imagine such a group of young prodigies gathering together and talking over tea like it was nothing. If news about this matter spread, it would most likely shock many a people.\u201cBrother Jin Yang, I heard that you exchanged blows with a gentleman from the Eastern Wilderness a while back, and the exchange ended in a tie? In the end, you even became sworn brothers with that gentleman\u2026is that true?\u201dInside the pavilion, someone couldn\u2019t keep their curiosity and asked the youth who looked to be the Holy Son of some mighty Holy Land.This youth, with his hair as red as a flame, and his body covered in brilliant glow, was the Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land:\u00a0\u2018Jin Yang!\u2019The Buddhist Holy Land had a heritage in the Middle State that was even older than the Ancient Lin Family. Their Ancestors had also Ascended to the Upper Realm, so they also had a terrifying background.As the Holy Son of such a mighty power, it was only natural that Jin Yang\u2019s cultivation wouldn\u2019t be ordinary. He could easily overwhelm his peers, and right now, he was in the late stages of the Transcendent Realm.Hearing the question, he couldn\u2019t help but show a hearty smile and reply, \u201cThat\u2019s true, of course! Let me tell you this, and I am not bragging when I speak\u2026my little brother has a terrifying talent you wouldn\u2019t see in a thousand years!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s only in the middle stage of the Transcendent Realm, yet he could fight me through a hundred exchanges, and still didn\u2019t show any signs of fatigue or loss. He even forced me to use my [True Sun Physique], and only then was I able to barely suppress him. Even then, I felt that he still had a lot of trump cards that he hadn\u2019t used\u2026 \u201d\u201cMy little brother, ah! He\u2019s an extraordinary man with a calm temperament who can look at the big picture. Unfortunately, he offended someone,and was framed and exiled from the Eastern Wilderness!\u201dJin Yang said with a sigh full of regret.He had heard from his little brother that they couldn\u2019t yet contend against the person whom he had offended. What\u2019s more? He didn\u2019t really believe in the rumors he heard from the Eastern Wilderness.What bullshit jealousy? What bullshit toad wants to eat swan meat?From what he saw, it was clearly the Taixuan Holy Land that wanted to climb a dragon\u2019s back and ride on a phoenix\u2019s tail, and that was why they betrayed his little brother.And it was because of this that they spread rumors and false accusations about his brother, so much so that he was forced to leave the Eastern Wilderness.[Hiss!]Jin Yang\u2019s words caused the people in the pavilion to take in a deep breath. They couldn\u2019t help but look into each others\u2019 eyes, showing their deep shock.Jin Yang\u2019s personality was clear to all of these young geniuses. He was a man with a straightforward character who would never lie. What\u2019s more? Jin Yang was a mighty man, who was stronger than everyone on the scene!In the entirety of the Middle State, only a few like the third prince of the Great Xia Dynasty could contend against him on even ground, or suppress him. He could easily be ranked among the top five of the Middle State\u2019s younger generation!So now that he praised someone like this\u2026just how strong was this mysterious prodigy from the Eastern Wilderness?\u201cBrother Jin Yang, what\u2019s the name of this genius from the Eastern Wilderness you mentioned just now? We would love to get to know him some day!\u201dCuriosity spurred everyone, and they couldn\u2019t help but ask. They wanted to know who this mysterious genius was!\u201cThis\u2026\u201dJin Yang showed an embarrassed expression and hesitated from answering them. It\u2019s not that he couldn\u2019t say his little brother\u2019s name, but that\u2026he was afraid that if he mentioned his name, none of the people here would have the guts to ask anymore about him, or even think about this matter.Although Jin Yang was an upright fellow, he wasn\u2019t dumb.Seeing that he couldn\u2019t respond, everyone decided not to egg him on. Since he clearly didn\u2019t want to say it, there was no need to push him. All of them were smart fellows, after all.At this moment, one of them suddenly yelped, \u201cHow come the Lin Family\u2019s Star Picking Pavilion is open today?\u201dThe one who spoke was the Holy Son of the Chuyuan Holy Land, another powerful Heavenly Genius.Everyone followed his gaze, and they couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.The Star Picking Pavilion of the Ancient Lin Family was the tallest structure of the Moon-facing Ancient City. One could overlook everything from atop it, and it provided for an excellent view. It was also because of this that it was called the\u00a0\u2018Star Picking\u2019\u00a0Pavilion\u2026as it was the closest to the sky at night.From their current position, they could clearly see the scene before the Star Picking Pavilion.On normal days, the Star Picking Pavilion would only be opened to receive esteemed personnel from the major Holy Lands and Dynasties, such as the Holy Lords, Emperors, or other mighty figures.Yet it had been opened today?It surprised everyone.\u201cLook, the Great-Transcendent Realm Elders of the Lin Family have come out to receive someone\u2026\u201d\u201cY\u2019all, ain\u2019t that woman in blue Lin Qiuhan, the gorgeous, prodigious daughter of the Ancient Lin Family? And the other woman in white with her face half-covered behind a veil\u2026she seems to be from a Holy Land of the Eastern Wilderness. Taixuan Holy Maiden, I think\u2026\u201dThe speaker had once been to the Eastern Wilderness, and received the honor to gaze upon the beauty of the Eastern Wilderness\u2019s number one beauty.\u201cThen, the man in white is\u2026\u201d\u201cThat person?!\u201dAll of them soon returned to their senses, and couldn\u2019t help but stand up together with excited expressions on their faces. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess the identity of the mysterious man after they saw him receive such treatment.They never expected to see \u2018that\u2019\u00a0legendary Young Lord here!This was a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet him! All of them got up and readied themselves to meet him.Many of the proud women even took out makeup from their Spatial Pouches and hurriedly applied a thin layer on themselves to compound their radiance.The only person with an unnatural look in his eyes was Jin Yang, but no one noticed the change in his expression.\u2026.Gu Changge came to the Star Picking Pavilion under the guidance and arrangement of an Elder from the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s leadership. The treatment Gu Changge received was obviously the highest-tiered.One could easily overlook the entirety of the Moon-facing Ancient City, and even thousands of miles beyond its territory, from the Star Picking Pavilion.On normal days, only Saints were eligible to enter this place!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLong Term Plan; Kneeling and Licking the Young Lord\u2019s Boots!\u201cThe person who built this pavilion truly knows how to enjoy life.\u201dGu Changge stood with his hands behind his back, and overlooked the Moon-facing City from the highest point. He couldn\u2019t help but praise the creator of the Star Picking Pavilion as he watched everything below, including the myriad cultivators who went around taking care of their own business.It felt wonderful to be high above watching the world as if a man looking at an anthill!He decided to ask a craftsman to build a lofty pavilion like this one in his residence once he returned to the Upper Realm. His\u00a0\u2018Sky Picking Pavilion\u2019\u00a0will be far taller and grander.With status and background like his own, he naturally had the right to enjoy such a treatment.\u201cWe are honored to know that it satisfies you, Young Lord Gu! This pavilion was specially built by the previous Patriarchs to host Holy Lords and Emperors from the various forces in the world.\u201dLin Qiuhan explained with a smile. If not for Gu Changge bringing her along, she wouldn\u2019t have the qualifications to the enter the Star Picking Pavilion.\u201cIndeed. To hold the Sun and the Moon in one hand, and to pick Stars with the other\u2026who in this world wouldn\u2019t desire to do something like that? It\u2019s a beautiful dream\u2026\u201dGu Changge said with a smile.He had a simple, long-term plan. The reason why he asked Lin Qiuhan to lead him to look around the ancient city was natural:\u00a0\u2018evaluate the extent of her Alchemy talent.\u2019\u00a0He had to consider how he should raise and use Lin Qiuhan after bringing her to the Upper Realm with him.Gu Changge had a terrifying background, and knew matters that ordinary people weren\u2019t privy to. Old Ming, an outsider with a different surname, naturally couldn\u2019t chance upon knowledge that was held by the faction behind him.Even the massive Alchemy Heritages in the Upper Realm didn\u2019t have a descendant with talent on par with Lin Qiuhan\u2019s monstrous talent for Alchemy!Once they went back to the Upper Realm, he might even be able to make use of Lin Qiuhan by using her as an insider to control those Alchemy Heritages. As long as he made good preparations, he wouldn\u2019t be the one taking the loss.Of course, Gu Changge also wanted to show her his generous and kind side, so as to conquer Lin Qiuhan as soon as possible. Won\u2019t it be awesome if he received 1000 Destiny Points by conquering?Fortunately, Lin Qiuhan was a woman without sophisticated thoughts. Gu Changge quickly put her under his spell through his\u00a0\u2018sweet words,\u2019\u00a0and soon, her heart and attention were completely focused on him.What Lin Tian said before wasn\u2019t wrong. Gu Changge was no gentleman, after all, he was destined by the Heavens to be a villain. Having said that, though, Gu Changge would never mistreat his own people.He didn\u2019t have any deep ill-will towards Lin Qiuhan, instead, he was only thinking about how he could get some benefits from her after raising her in the future.\u201cTo hold the Sun and the Moon in one hand, and to pick stars with the other\u2026Young Lord Gu, what\u2019s your opinion on the exact reason behind why everyone tries to cultivate?\u201dA deep brilliance filled Lin Qiuhan\u2019s eyes as she heard his fascinating words, and repeated them.\u201cIn my opinion, cultivation is merely the process of leaving the Earth and stepping foot into Heaven \u2014 that\u2019s all. People fight for opportunities, sacrifice their flesh, blood, and tears, go through the deserts, and use their bodies as rafts to cross the sea of bitterness\u2026it\u2019s all to get to the other shore!\u201dGu Changge responded with an indifferent yet elegant smile on his face. Of course, he didn\u2019t mean what he said, and was merely using words to make himself appear deep. To him, cultivation was nothing more than putting in points and enjoying life.\u201cThe sea of bitterness? The other side?\u201dEven Su Qingge\u2019s eyes lit up, and she couldn\u2019t help but deeply ponder over his words with great relish.\u201cYour opinion is really different from the others, Young Lord Gu, but there\u2019s also a deep meaning behind them\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan couldn\u2019t help but admire him even more. Just like that, she and Gu Changge began conversing over many more matters, and Gu Changge was very involved in the responses.He wasn\u2019t someone who acted high above and gave mere perfunctory responses, and that made Lin Qiuhan\u2019s admiration for him deepen further and further. In particular, his insights on cultivation made her, a teacher of a cultivation academy, feel as if a new pathway had opened in front of her.Using their bodies as rafts to cross the sea of bitterness to get to the other side?It was an unprecedented statement that made her have a new understanding of the mysterious and vast world of cultivation of the Upper Realm. She couldn\u2019t imagine just what kind of place it was up there.\u201cYoung Lord Gu, it\u2019s thanks to your words that I was able to realize something was wrong with Little Tian. If not for you, he would have kept me in the dark, and I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan\u2019s expression turned bleak and sadness masked her face as she recalled the recent events.She had always cared about Lin Tian, so it was unforgivable if he had truly done something to harm Young Lord Gu. Fortunately, that person wasn\u2019t the real Lin Tian, or she wouldn\u2019t have the face to stand in front of Gu Changge.\u201cI was merely speaking casually at the time, and never knew that something like this would happen\u2026\u201dGu Changge responded with an amiable smile.\u201cActually, I had some suspicions about someone messing with Little Tian\u2019s soul, so I was going to ask him about that, but then it all happened so suddenly\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan said with some feelings of guilt welling up in her heart.\u201cOh! Speaking of which, I must give Lady Lin an important reminder.\u201dGu Changge said with a mysterious smile on his face.\u201cYoung Lord Gu, please speak.\u201dLin Qiuhan asked for him to continue. Since it was something\u00a0\u2018important\u2019\u00a0in Gu Changge\u2019s words, then it must be something truly significant.\u201cYou must pay attention to Lin Tian\u2019s corpse. I guess he\u2019s not just controlled by someone, but that someone has replaced his soul and taken over his body. There are many such techniques in the Upper Realm that let you do this\u2026\u201d\u201cResurrection after death is a common matter, actually!\u201dLin Qiuhan was stunned for a moment. Resurrection? Was that really possible?At that time, Lin Tian\u2019s vitality and soul had already perished, yet Gu Changge\u2019s words made her rethink everything.Was he faking his death?\u201cOf course, it\u2019s merely a guess of mine. Still, it would be better if Lady Lin pays a bit more attention to everything.\u201dGu Changge said with a calm smile.He truly desired to let Lin Qiuhan watch Lin Tian\u00a0\u2018rise from his grave\u2019\u00a0with her own two eyes. That would be enough to shatter whatever little trust Lin Qiuhan had left in him.Gu Changge naturally didn\u2019t need to keep Lin Tian around anymore.\u2026.A loud sound from outside the Star Picking Pavilion sounded at this time.\u201cYoung Lord Gu, a group of young geniuses from the Middle State and the Eastern Wilderness are requesting an audience with you!\u201dElder Lin, who had led Gu Changge to the Star Picking Pavilion, respectfully walked in and reported.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but raise his eyebrows a bit. He wanted to reject them, but then he realized that he had nothing better to do, so he nodded and said, \u201cAlright, let them in.\u201dHe hoped that this bunch of arrogant brats could bring him some fun.Soon, a large group of young men and women with extraordinary auras and brilliant radiance around their bodies respectfully entered the Star Picking Pavilion behind the Elder of the Ancient Lin Family.\u201cChu Xuan pays respects to the Young Lord!\u201dGu Changge\u2019s number one lapdog from the Eastern Wilderness, the Taixuan Holy Son, Chu Xuan, was also among them. He hurriedly walked forward and respectfully saluted Gu Changge and started to flatter him.Beside him, there were also other prodigious youths from the Eastern Wilderness who had accompanied Gu Changge on his travel to the Middle State. There weren\u2019t many unfamiliar faces in their group.The final group was the arrogant prodigies of the Middle State.At this moment, all of them stood in shock as their excitement soared to the Ninth Layer of Heaven. After all, it was their first time coming into contact with this esteemed Young Lord from the Upper Realm.They couldn\u2019t help but feel awe in their hearts as they gazed upon his godly presence.\u201cWe pay our respects to the Young Lord!\u201dEven Jin Yang, the Buddhist Holy Land\u2019s Holy Son who was previously criticizing Gu Changge in his heart, didn\u2019t dare to not pay his respects.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for such politeness, everyone.\u201dGu Changge sat at the host\u2019s seat in the pavilion, and nodded to the guests. He had a calm and amiable expression, without a shred of pretence or arrogance, which helped relax everyone\u2019s tense nerves.The rumors weren\u2019t false. The mysterious Young Lord was indeed not someone difficult to get along with.Afterwards, the group of young geniuses introduced themselves, and began to show off their cool skills to leave a good impression on Gu Changge. All of them competed like peacocks who showed their majestic wings to suppress the others.From time to time, Gu Changge would nod and smile, and those gestures from him encouraged everyone.Even those\u00a0\u2018favored daughters of heaven\u2019[1] who normally didn\u2019t put anyone else in their eyes turned into boot-licking b!tch3z, and their sudden change stunned Lin Qiuhan and the others.The same people who loved to be referred to as Fairy and Goddess had now submitted in front of Young Lord Gu, and turned into his obedient pets.It was an eye-opening experience for them.Lin Qiuhan was the one who felt the deepest emotions from all of this. After all, she was also a favored daughter of heaven like those gorgeous beauties. However, Young Lord Gu\u2019s attitude towards her was completely different from his attitude towards these arrogant \u2018princesses.\u2019This sudden discovery flattered Lin Qiuhan, and she felt something she had never felt before.Young Lord Gu treated her completely differently.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[FOOTNOTES][1]: The \u2018favored daughters of heaven\u2019 here refers to just ordinary women from great backgrounds who have been blessed by the Heavens with great talent, beauty, and prestige. They are completely different from the \u2018Favored Daughters of Heaven\u2019 who are literally babysitted by the Heavenly Daddy himself and are blessed with game-breaking Fortune, destined to rule over all.If you see lower case \u2018favored daughter/son/child/children of heaven\u2019, then it will be referring to normal people who are protected by the Heavenly Daddy. If you see upper case \u2018Favored Daughter/Son/Child/Children of Heaven\u2019, then it will be referring to plot-armor protected people loved by the Heavenly Daddy.I hope this is clear enough.

The gorgeous girls in front of her were either Royal Princesses or Holy Maidens, and none of them were worse than her when it came to background.They had countless suitors following after them like dogs, yet all of them pretended to be aloof and untouchable. They dismissed the advances of everyone, and gained fame as Fairies and Goddesses.But now, they were cursing each other and ingratiating themselves in front of Young Lord Gu. Right now, they looked nothing different from how women who sold their flesh in the brothels were described in the books.Such a scene, that completely different from their normal actions, would shock anyone if they saw it from outside.Still, it was, indeed, the attitude they should be holding before Gu Changge!\u2018Young Lord Gu is so kind to me\u2026\u2019Lin Qiuhan recalled all the time she spent with Gu Changge, and all the topics he discussed with her, and couldn\u2019t help but feel lightheaded.Su Qingge, on the other hand, was used to such a scene already. No matter how one looked at him, Gu Changge had everything that a woman could desire in a man. How could these beauties treat him the same as others after knowing his might?She had no doubt that they had the following thoughts in their mind:\u00a0\u2018if she (Su Qingge) and Lin Qiuhan can receive the Young Lord\u2019s favor, why can\u2019t they?\u2019Once they fostered a relationship with the Young Lord, their status will take a three-sixty degree turn for the better. There\u2019s nothing they wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain at that time, so how could they hold back from pleasing the Young Lord?Su Qingge saw through their thoughts at one glance.Her expression was calm, and not a shred of worry rose in her heart. Did these women really think a bit of makeup on their faces could get them her Young Lord\u2019s attention? No way, considering his temperament.That warm and elegant expression he showed them was nothing but a facade. The true Gu Changge was indifferent to everything in the world. He was an aloof and elusive man who overlooked everything from high above.One had to commend Su Qingge\u2019s for her sharp mind. She had only been with Gu Changge for a while, yet she had already developed a certain understanding of his antics.[Ding! You have successfully subdued Lin Qiuhan, and this has triggered a Fortune Event! You have received 200 Points of Fortune Value, and 1000 Destiny Points!]A sudden System Prompt sounded in Gu Changge\u2019s mind, washing him with euphoria. The thousand Destiny Points he was looking forward to all day were already in his pocket!Lin Qiuhan didn\u2019t disappoint him.Right now, he could no longer be bothered to listen, or respond, to the spiel[1] spewed by the bunch of\u00a0\u2018geniuses\u2019\u00a0in front of him who kept talking about their contest.[VILFIC: spiel means nonsense used by salespeople to trick you into buying their garbage.]Who in their right mind would want to listen to a bunch of brats touting their own horns?Gu Changge paid no more attention to them, and focused his mind on the System. Immediately, the System\u2019s Attribute Panel appeared in his line of sight.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Host: Gu ChanggeIdentity: True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao PalaceBloodline: Devil Heart, Dao BoneCultivation: Conferred Lord (Middle Stage)Mystical Abilities:Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex (7th Layer)Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple (Talent)Myriad Changes Demonic Physique (Talent)Immortal-Devouring Demon Art\u2026Destiny Points: 2600Fortune Value: 350 (Dark)System Shop: OpenWarehouse:Domain-Traversing Talisman x1One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x1\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014His Fortune Value had shot through the 300 Points mark. It wasn\u2019t all because he subdued Lin Qiuhan, but also because he had Su Qingge with him. Both of them were blessed with great Fortune, so Gu Changge\u2019s Fortune Value naturally rose as he used them well.He had essentially obliterated Lin Tian without even putting in any effort, and he also obtained some 2000 Destiny Points.Gu Changge felt immense comfort after receiving this wave of harvest from his leek.Gu Changge pondered for a while, and decided not to increase his strength. After all, his current realm was pretty strong in the Lower Realm. He decided to reserve these omnipotent Destiny Points for an occasion where he could make best use of them.After that, he glanced at the stuff in the System Shop.Finally, after looking around for a while, he found a suitable [Pill Dao] Technique worth a hundred Destiny Points.[Exchange!]After spending a hundred Destiny Points, Gu Changge successfully received the [Elementary-level Pill Dao] technique. He planned to find the right opportunity to hand it over to Lin Qiuhan. After all, if he wanted to train her for himself, he had to start early.It was a good [Pill Dao] technique, so he hoped she wouldn\u2019t waste it.As soon as Gu Changge\u2019s consciousness exited from the System, another Prompt sounded in his mind.[Ding! Discovered someone with a string of fate connected to a Favored Son of Heaven! Please suppress the Favored Son of Heaven\u2019s sworn brother! You will receive 500 Destiny Points on completing this task! There\u2019s no penalty for failure.]Gu Changge was taken aback, and an expression of interest appeared on his face. This was the first time he encountered such a random task. What\u2019s more? There was a reward if he completed it, but no penalty even if he didn\u2019t complete it.It was essentially up to him whether he took it ornot.500 Destiny Points\u2026it was quite an appetizing amount!It\u2019s just that who the heck was this sworn brother of a Favored Son of Heaven, and which Favored Son of Heaven was he related to? He concluded that the person must be related to Ye Chen, after all, Lin Tian was already a goner.The System hadn\u2019t mentioned the target\u2019s identity, but the person should be one of the prodigious kids in front of him.It shouldn\u2019t be someone from the Eastern Wilderness, unless, of course, they had something wrong with their head and foolishly decided to court death. Knowing that Ye Chen offended him, the people there would most certainly cut off any and all relationship with Ye Chen, and even hide themselves somewhere far away.Since Ye Chen escaped to the Middle State all the way from the Eastern Wilderness, he must have come across one or two geniuses of the Middle State on his way. It\u2019s then that he became sworn brothers with the genius, and opened a path for himself to enter a new map, the Middle State.It was quite a normal trope.It\u2019s just that he never thought he would have to deal with this\u00a0\u2018sworn brother\u2019?Either way, it was a great offer.Gu Changge took a sip of his tea, and an expression of slight joy appeared on his face as he considered the matter. He quickly swept a glance over all the geniuses around him, completely ignoring all the people from the Eastern Wilderness, and those beauties who were trying to ingratiate themselves before him.He knew who to look at.\u201cChu Xuan\u2026\u201dGu Changge spoke with an authoritative tone.\u201cMy Lord, what is your command?\u201dChu Xuan ran over as soon as he heard his call, and responded with a respectful and flattering expression on his face. This scene made the many youths develop envy and jealousy towards him in their hearts. They were also heaven\u2019s favored, yet this Chu Xuan had already won the appreciation of the mighty Young Lord. They estimated that it won\u2019t be long before Chu Xuan soared to the Heavens, and left them all behind as they became people of two different worlds.\u201cIs there any news about Ye Chen in the Middle State?\u201dGu Changge asked with indifference. He naturally knew the answer to his question, after all, Ye Chen\u2019s location was always in his eyes. It\u2019s just that it wasn\u2019t yet time for him to squeeze him dry.The only reason he asked the question was to see the crowd\u2019s reaction.\u201cYe Chen?\u201dChu Xuan\u2019s expression changed to an embarrassed one. He touched the back of his head, and said, \u201cMy Lord\u2026that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have lost track of him, right?\u201dGu Changge gave him a deep look, and immediately, Chu Xuan felt cold sweat pouring down his forehead. He was scared, and couldn\u2019t help but look towards Su Qingge for help.Although it was his honor to be the Young Lord\u2019s lapdog, he couldn\u2019t withstand such a terrifying pressure from him.Ye Chen?!Who was that?The expressions of the other geniuses in the surroundings also changed. Fortunately, Gu Changge hadn\u2019t asked them this question, or they wouldn\u2019t know how to keep standing.They had heard some rumors from the Middle State, but they weren\u2019t too sure about the details, after all.At this time, the Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land, Jin Yang, felt great unease in his heart. Although he was a straightforward and upright person, he also had his pride. He despised this group of otherwise-arrogant\u00a0\u2018geniuses\u2019, and even felt disdain towards them when he watched them lick Gu Changge\u2019s boots.In his opinion, his little brother Ye Chen\u2019s \u2018calm and determined\u2019[1]\u00a0 temperament was many times better than all of these\u00a0\u2018geniuses.\u2019When he heard Gu Changge ask about Ye Chen\u2019s whereabouts, he couldn\u2019t help but groan in his heart. He thought that there was something wrong. Fortunately, he was doing his best to restrain himself and not show any abnormality.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[FOOTNOTES][1]: LMAO, yeah, right! Bruh, you haven\u2019t seen how calm and determined your broder was in the Taixuan Holy Lord\u2019s Hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one dared to open their mouths, and sweat flowed down everyone\u2019s backs. Although Gu Changge was questioning Chu Xuan, they still felt the pressure.Even Lin Qiuhan, who felt comfortable talking to Gu Changge before, couldn\u2019t ignore the terrifying pressure he radiated at this moment.Any misconception she developed from Young Lord Gu\u2019s initial gentleness and elegance was now gone. Deep down, he was truly someone who stood high above the others and looked down on the world like a god!This was his real side!Still, she was also a bit curious about this person named Ye Chen. She wondered who he was? She had never paid much attention to rumors and gossip from outside, so she didn\u2019t know about what happened in the Eastern Wilderness.At this time, Su Qingge spoke up with a hint of apology in her cold words, \u201cYoung Lord, the land of the Middle State is vast beyond measure, so finding someone who is intentionally hiding themselves in here is no different from looking for a needle in a haystack\u2026\u201dIt was now that everyone got a good glimpse of Su Qingge, the number one beauty of the Eastern Wilderness, when she started speaking up. Before this, she was silently standing behind Gu Changge, and peacefully watching the flowers near a pond in the pavilion.Still, their fear of Gu Changge made sure that they wouldn\u2019t dare look at her for too long.It had to be said that Su Qingge, the Taixuan Holy Maiden, truly deserved her reputation as the number one beauty of the Eastern Wilderness. Even her plain veil and simple white dress couldn\u2019t shroud her gorgeousness.She appeared sacred, ethereal and unsullied by the dust of the mortal world. With a transcendent temperament, she looked like a Fairy who had descended from the Ninth Heaven.Her radiance easily eclipsed the\u00a0\u2018beauty\u2019\u00a0of all the other favored daughters of heaven, and none of them had the qualifications to contend with him.\u2018Sure enough, she\u2019s one with a vicious heart. Just because she had kingdom-toppling beauty and temperament that could ensnare everyone, it didn\u2019t mean she was a good person\u2026\u2019Jin Yang couldn\u2019t help but curse in his heart, and his impression of Su Qingge worsened further. Everyone else, on the other hand, were curious to know how Su Qingge had the guts to persuade Gu Changge even when he was giving off such terrifying pressure.Just how much courage was required for this?Chu Xuan couldn\u2019t help but give her a grateful look.\u201cSince even Qingge says that, I will let this matter go for now. Chu Xuan, don\u2019t let me down\u2026\u201dGu Changge said with a flat tone without a hint of emotion behind his words.\u201cYes, yes, My Lord, please don\u2019t worry; I will definitely find Ye Chen\u2019s whereabouts!\u201dChu Xuan relaxed and smacked his chest in a hurry to pledge his obeisance. Cold sweat kept flowing down his back, and he felt as if he was a weak man standing in front of a mighty tiger ready to rip him apart.The scene, on the other hand, shocked everyone! The Taixuan Holy Maiden was favored so heavily that she could even persuade the Young Lord?They couldn\u2019t help but change the way they looked at Su Qingge. At one time, they were peers of the same generation, yet now, they could only watch her in awe.\u201cThank you, Young Lord.\u201dSu Qingge smiled at Gu Changge with an expression full of joy. Of course, she knew full well that Gu Changge only called out Chu Xuan like this to scare him. As for why he did that? She couldn\u2019t guess.Still, she could play along with Gu Changge and help him take a step back.Even though no change appeared in Gu Changge\u2019s expression, he couldn\u2019t help but praise Su Qingge for her sharp mind in his heart. A woman like her who could understand his intentions was obviously to his liking.After his small test, he realized that not a single person reacted to Ye Chen\u2019s name. All of them showed doubtful or unchanged expressions, and their auras didn\u2019t tremble either.[VILFIC: Were it a cliche novel, Jin Yang would have reacted and he would be found out. The MC would then smack him to death with a single fart, and that would be the end of it.]Of course, Gu Changge was in no hurry. His interest was piqued, and he wanted to see how long this person could hold on.Next, everyone started to whisper among themselves.The young geniuses couldn\u2019t help but ask Chu Xuan about Ye Chen\u2019s origins, and how he had offended the Young Lord.Chu Xuan began explaining to them, and explained how Ye Chen courted death and offended the Young Lord. As soon as they heard his explanation, their expressions turned strange.\u201cWhy do we feel like we have heard about him\u2026\u201dHe came from the Eastern Wilderness, has no background, is in his early twenties, with a cultivation base around the Transcendent Realm, and was born with extraordinary talent\u2026Wasn\u2019t that description similar to what Jin Yang, the Buddhist Holy Land\u2019s Holy Son, described about his sworn brother? When they had asked him for his sworn brother\u2019s name, he had kept quiet for some reason, no?Many of them made some guesses, and couldn\u2019t help but smirk. Who gave a damn about their relationship with the Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land if they could please Young Gu Changge?!\u201cMy Lord, I think the Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land should know Ye Chen\u2019s whereabouts\u2026\u201dThe Holy Son of the Chuyuan Holy Land spoke up, and took the lead in explaining to everyone what Jin Yang had said before in the previous pavilion.\u2018This goddamn Dog-Son of the Chuyuan Holy Land\u2026\u2019Jin Yang\u2019s face paled and cold sweat flowed down his forehead.\u201cOh! Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land, do you know Ye Chen?\u201dGu Changge took another sip of his tea and asked with a gentle voice. Everything was within his expectations! His eyes fell on the young man whose hair appeared as if they were on fire like the burning sun.[Hum!]The terrifying and majestic pressure from before descended once more. All the young geniuses from the land of the Middle State paled, and even their souls trembled as horrified expressions masked their faces.How terrifying was the Young Lord\u2019s strength?Even their Holy Lords and Emperors couldn\u2019t compare to him.Could he be someone of the Conferred Lord Realm?How could that be? He looked no older than themselves\u2026no, he might even be younger than them!\u201cAs expected of Young Lord Gu! He\u2019s even stronger than my father\u2026\u201dStars of admiration filled Lin Qiuhan\u2019s eyes as he watched Gu Changge.\u2018Was this the Young Lord\u2019s purpose behind the sudden question? He wanted to know who had something to do with Ye Chen?\u2019Su Qingge finally understood his reasons somewhat. But she didn\u2019t understand how Gu Changge knew there was someone here who was related to Ye Chen.Gu Changge appeared more and more unfathomable to her!\u201cSir, I do know Brother Ye Chen\u2026\u201dJin Yang replied. He couldn\u2019t even breathe well under the terrifying pressure, and his pale had turned pale. He was stunned beyond measure, and couldn\u2019t understand how the difference between them could be so enormous?It was as if he was a toad watching the sun from the bottom of a well!Right now, he felt that it was impossible for him to not admit that he knew Ye Chen. He had already exposed a lot when talking to the other geniuses. He regretted his loud mouth, and felt that he shouldn\u2019t have said so much back there.\u201cOh! It\u2019s good that you know him. So, where\u2019s Ye Chen right now?\u201dGu Changge asked as if nothing was wrong, and his expression also showed no change.\u201cForgive me, Sir, but I can\u2019t reveal Brother Ye Chen\u2019s whereabouts!\u201dJin Yang gritted his teeth and responded. His back had already turned wet with cold sweat, and he finally understood the terrifying might of the Young Lord in front of him. He couldn\u2019t even withstand his aura!No wonder Ye Chen ran all the way over to the Middle State and didn\u2019t dare to show himself too much!Still, Yan Jing didn\u2019t want to expose his Brother Ye Chen\u2019s whereabouts. He had already exposed much before, and wouldn\u2019t feel good if he even gave away his location.\u201cFoolish! Let me ask you again:\u00a0\u2018where\u2019s Ye Chen right now?\u2019\u201dGu Changge\u2019s expression finally showed a change. His eyes showed a deep abyss, and his expression radiated an unquestionable majesty as if he were a god!\u201cSir, Ye Chen is my sworn brother, and I am well aware of his character! Might there be some misunderstanding between you\u2026\u201dJin Yang responded through gritted teeth. He trembled all over, and couldn\u2019t help but want to kneel down under the mighty suppression pressing down on him. Still, he had his own pride and wouldn\u2019t give in \u2014 no matter what happened, he will defend Ye Chen!\u201cIt\u2019s an honor for you to be questioned by me.\u201dGu Changge looked at him as if he was looking down at an ant, and without any turmoil in his tone, he continued, \u201cWho do you think you are to question me?\u201dAs his words fell, a terrifying intent surged from his body and pressed down on Jin Yang. With a groan, Jin Yang spat out blood, and fell to his knees. His face turned as sickly pale, and he couldn\u2019t resist the pressure bearing down on him!\u201cMy Lord, our Holy Son is foolish and provoked you; I hope My Lord can forgive his transgression!\u201dJin Yang\u2019s hidden protector was frightened and immediately showed himself. With a plop, he knelt on the ground and begged for forgiveness with a horrified expression.He never expected that things would develop to such a point. How could their Holy Son be so retarded? Wasn\u2019t he bringing a disaster to their Holy Land?!The Star Picking Pavilion turned dead-silent, and the audience didn\u2019t even dare breathe loudly in fear of offending the Heavens and bringing down a calamity upon themselves.[Ding! You have successfully suppressed the Favored Son of Heaven\u2019s sworn brother and completed the mission\u2026][Task Completion Rating: Perfect][You received a 40 percent bonus for completing the task with Perfection!

Not only was the task simple, but it also gave him a full 700 Destiny Points. He could consider it as repayment for the 100 Destiny Points he spent on the [Pill Dao] technique just before.Right now, he had almost 3000 Destiny Points, and that amount could be considered a huge sum.As for how the System decided the\u00a0\u2018Completion Rating\u2019, Gu Changge couldn\u2019t be bothered to think about it. The System must have its own rating system. He had simply done what he thought best.He was gentle and caring towards Su Qingge and the others because he had some plans for them. As for this Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land\u2026the heck was he? Did he think he was some Favored Son of Heaven? Who gave him the guts to provoke him and prance about in front of him?He was a measly ant who didn\u2019t even have the qualifications to be a leek!Gu Changge could easily squash him to death, and he even had a suitable reason to justify it. As for Ye Chen\u2019s whereabouts? He didn\u2019t even care about those. From the start to the end, he was merely trying to complete the random task presented before him by the System.The Star Picking Pavilion turned dead silent. Everyone\u2019s face turned pale as they watched the scene in front of them, and some of the geniuses couldn\u2019t help but turn pale. No one dared to speak up.\u201cSir, please forgive us\u2026\u201d\u201cOur Holy Son was foolish and provoked you in error\u2026\u201dJin Yang, the Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land, and his guardian looked extremely pale and terrified. They couldn\u2019t help but kneel on the ground and beg for forgiveness.It\u2019s just that Gu Changge no longer bothered with them, and said with a faint voice, \u201cOld Ming\u2026\u201d\u201cMy Lord, this old slave is at your command!\u201dThe void trembled, and an old man in black appeared out of nowhere with a respectful expression. It was none other than Old Ming.Although he had received permission to return to his family, he had been continuously following Gu Changge in the shadows, and didn\u2019t have the guts to leave his side at all.Old Ming\u2019s sudden appearance at this time gave everyone an even deeper shock. It was the first time they saw this legendary figure, the Ancestor of the Ancient Lin Family, who had Ascended to the Upper Realm some thirty-thousand years ago.Seeing his respectful and subservient attitude, they couldn\u2019t help but believe the rumors they had heard.\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that the Buddhist Holy Land still exists tomorrow\u2026\u201dGu Changge gave out a death sentence without batting an eye.\u201cUnderstood! This old slave will make them disappear immediately.\u201dOld Ming obliged, and the void around him trembled once more as he disappeared from the place as fast as he had appeared.[Hiss!]Everyone\u2019s scalps turned numb, and they felt as if their minds would explode. A terrifying chill ran down their backs.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHoly Son Jin Yang\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief and he spewed another mouthful of blood. He never thought his actions would bring such a disaster to his Holy Land!He couldn\u2019t help but regret his actions, and curse himself and his stupidity.The Young Lord from the Upper Realm was truly ruthless!\u201cIt\u2019s over\u2026\u201dJin Yang\u2019s guardian\u2019s face lost all color, and deep despair filled his eyes.The Chuyuan Holy Son, the Myriad Flowers Fairy, and the others couldn\u2019t help but turn pale and tremble. All of them were also from major forces of the Middle State, so they couldn\u2019t help but question themselves:\u00a0\u2018had it been us, would we end up like this, too?\u2019The answer was clear to them. The Young Lord\u2019s gentle and amiable smile was not what it looked like. In reality, all of them were nothing more than a bunch of ants in front of him, and he couldn\u2019t even be bothered about their existence.He decided the fate of the Buddhist Holy Land with a single sentence!All of them felt as if they could see rivers of blood and mountains of flesh in front of them. And all of this because one of them was stupid enough to pit himself against the Young Lord.Even Su Qingge and Lin Qiuhan felt chills run down their backs. It was the first time they saw Gu Changge do something like this. He was truly aloof and indifferent\u2026like a god looking down upon everything and deciding the fate of mere mortals.This was his true face!Su Qingge couldn\u2019t help but feel fortunate over the fact that Gu Changge treated her really well. It could be said that he was pretty much pampering her one-sidedly.\u2026.The matter regarding the Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land offending the Young Lord from the Upper Realm in the Star Picking Pavilion soon spread to all parts of the Middle State from the Moon-facing Ancient City. The news caused a massive uproar, and set off storms in all directions.Countless cultivators were horrified and shivered at the thought.Soon, the ins and outs of the entire event came out from the mouths of the other geniuses present at the scene, and everyone began discussing the matter in great detail.Not only did the Holy Son of the Buddhist Holy Land become sworn brothers with the Upper Realm\u2019s Young Lord\u2019s enemy, but he even dared to conceal his whereabouts and refused to open his mouth. This was what angered the Young Lord and brought extinction upon the Buddhist Holy Land.Countless cultivators sighed and felt that the Buddhist Holy Land\u2019s Holy Son was a retard. Instead of dying by himself, he had dragged his entire Holy Land to Hell with him.Of course, some people celebrated their destruction in their heart and said that they deserved it!Who asked that fool to court death?The Buddhist Holy Land had a hundred-thousand years long heritage in the Middle State. They also had an Ancestor who had reached the False God Realm and Ascended to the Upper Realm, so they held many cultivation techniques and treasures, and had an extremely profound background.However, a giant palm directly covered all of its territory from the and obliterated it from the earth. Even their Ancestor[1] who had been in seclusion couldn\u2019t form a shred of resistance before the mighty palm after coming out. It was as if the Heavens themselves had descended to exterminate them![1: This Ancestor is a normal old man who is probably in Conferred Lord or Conferred King Realm, at most. He isn\u2019t some False God Realm hidden oldie. Just like the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s Highest Elder who told them about the return of their Ancestor.]The structures and mountains in a radius of five-thousand miles turned into ruins. At the same time, the oppressive breath of a False God Realm monstrosity pressed down from above, terrifying countless cultivators into hiding.\u201cSuch injustice will bring upon you the Heaven\u2019s wrath one day\u2026\u201d\u201cNot even God will shelter you once that happens\u2026\u201dIn the end, the matter ended with the roar of the Buddhist Holy Lord resounded in all directions. With that, the Buddhist Holy Land was exterminated from the land of the Middle State forever, in one fell swoop.This incident caused a great sensation in the Middle State, and even the rest of the world. If even the Buddhist Holy Land, a heritage left behind by a False God, ended up like this, then what would become of them if they overreached?The thought horrified countless cultivators, shaking them from head to toe, and their fear of the Young Lord from the Upper Realm deepened further and further. After all, everything that exists in the Lower Realm was nothing more than a bunch of ants and their antics before the eyes of the beings of the Upper Realm. They couldn\u2019t even be bothered to look at their existence!The cultivator named Ye Chen, who came from the Eastern Wilderness, gained a renewed notoriety in the Middle State as his name resounded everywhere as a God of Plague.In order to please Gu Changge, some cultivators and forces even began looking for Ye Chen\u2019s trail everywhere, so as to capture him alive.\u2026.[A remote town of the Central Heavenly City of the Middle State]A youth with a dignified face and an ordinary appearance listened to the people around him. Suddenly, a piece of news hit him like a bolt from the blue, and his body stiffened on the spot.\u201cBrother Jin Yang\u2026\u201d\u201cI will definitely kill Gu Changge and avenge your Buddhist Holy Land!\u201dHis eyes turned red, and he ground his teeth. His body trembled, and an aura of desolation radiated from his person.Originally, he had planned to go to the Buddhist Holy Land due to his relationship with their Holy Son, and the fact that the Buddhist Holy Land showed appreciation for his talent\u2026but who would expect that he would receive the news about the complete extermination of the Buddhist Holy Land in such a short time. He felt deep rage and coldness in his heart, which compounded his madness and hatred.\u201cMaster, quickly tell me how I can become stronger as fast as possible; I must kill Gu Changge no matter what!\u201d\u201cI MUST KILL HIM!\u201dYe Chen said through gritted teeth, with reddened eyes. Jin Yang could be considered one of his most important friend and brother! He was an upright man who treated him better than anyone else. But, in the end, he was implicated and even the Buddhist Holy Land that raised him met a disaster because of his relationship with him.And the reason for all that was none other than that GU Changge! He wished to dismember Gu Changge into a million pieces! He wanted to shred his corpse apart, and only then would he be able to vent his hatred!\u201cLittle Chen\u2026\u201dYan Ji couldn\u2019t help but helplessly shake her head inside the ring. This matter had developed had reached a point she never wanted it to reach. She also gave up on her plan to persuade Ye Chen into giving up his hatred and prejudice towards Gu Changge.Ye Chen was already a maddened beast, and all her persuasions would fall upon deaf ears. He wouldn\u2019t rest until one of them died.This put Yan Ji in a difficult situation, after all, she had a good impression of Gu Changge.Still, she couldn\u2019t ignore Ye Chen\u2026Yan Ji sighed and said to Ye Chen, \u201cAccording to the fragment you got, the ancient Secret Realm of First Heavenly Era will soon open. Not only is there an ancient weapon sealed inside, but it also contains the inheritance of the weapon\u2019s owner inside\u2026\u201d\u201cI will definitely get the inheritance and kill Gu Changge!\u201dYe Chen\u2019s grief disappeared, and he soon calmed down. He couldn\u2019t help but clench his fists and grit his teeth in resolve.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To him, destroying them was no different from stepping on an ant.Old Ming was a mighty man of the God King Realm in the Upper Realm. Even though he couldn\u2019t exert his true might and was limited by the Lower Realm\u2019s laws at the False God Realm, it was still easy for him to exterminate a place like the Buddhist Holy Land with a flip of his hand.What\u2019s more? There hadn\u2019t been anyone who broke through to the False God Realm in the Middle State over the last few millenniums. Existences at the mere Conferred Lord Realm could become the Guardians or Supreme Elders of Holy Lands and Dynasties, and Conferred Kings couldn\u2019t even be seen anywhere.Gu Changge reckoned that only those Forbidden Regions and the Ancient Sacred Mountains could have False God Realm cultivators hidden in their depths.Old Ming\u2019s strength was more than enough for him to do whatever he wanted in the Middle State. Of course, Gu Changge wasn\u2019t so free as to go and mess with anybody and everybody. As long as someone didn\u2019t provoke him, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to move.As they left the Star Picking Pavilion, Lin Qiuhan appeared somewhat afraid of him, and no longer behaved as casually as before. Gu Changge\u2019s true face frightened her. He was indifferent and aloof, someone who could determine the life and death of an ancient Holy Land with a few words.This side of him was completely different from his elegant and gentle appearance from before. It confused Lin Qiuhan a little, and she wondered what about him did she like?Was it his gentleness, or was it his eloquent speech and deep knowledege?\u201cAre you scared?\u201dGu Changge naturally knew how to deal with her turbulent emotions. His previous gentleness returned, his expression softened, and he lovingly caressed Lin Qiuhan\u2019s head.This simple move had a great effect of Lin Qiuhan.Her heart jumped in her chest and desired more. Young Lord Gu, who was aloof and indifferent to the others, treated her with such care and gentleness. She couldn\u2019t help but feel lightheaded once again.\u201cA little bit\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan answered honestly.\u201cYoung Lord, you scared me too!\u201dSu Qingge couldn\u2019t hold herself back and spoke out at this moment. She felt that Gu Changge didn\u2019t give her enough attention. Although she had a sharp mind, she was also a woman, so she couldn\u2019t help but feel sour and aggrieved in her heart when she watched Gu Changge treat another women so affectionately even though he always bullied her.Of course, she knew well that it was all just an act from Gu Changge.Gu Changge looked at her and said with a smirk, \u201cEven you were frightened? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s alright if I am frightened?\u2019\u2018Isn\u2019t this clear discrimination?\u2019Su Qingge rolled her eyes and silently vented in her heart.\u201cThis is a detailed record containing an Elementary-level [Pill Dao] technique; take it as my token of apology. \u201dGu Changge took out the [Pill Dao] technique he took from the System and handed it over to Lin Qiuhan. Either way, he had to find a reason sooner or later to hand it over to her. After all, it was something he exchanged for a hundred Destiny Points from the System\u2019s Shop.Gu Changge had casually flipped through it, and saw that it recorded many valuable Elementary-level Pill recipes. He estimated that even the Alchemy Heritages in the Upper Realm didn\u2019t have a technique as detailed as the one in his hand.The products produced by the System were most definitely the highest-quality ones, and he wouldn\u2019t take any loss from it.\u201cThank you, Young Lord!\u201dLin Qiuhan thanked him in surprise.To think that Young Lord Gu would actually give her something like this! How did he tell she was interested in Alchemy?Lin Qiuhan\u2019s heart thumped as she thought about this.Her father had always forced her to cultivate with all her heart to strengthen her cultivation base and improve her Realm. She was never allowed to dabble in any other aspects, so she didn\u2019t know much about Alchemy even though she held great interest in it.\u201cAs long as you like it.\u201dGu Changge said with a smile. Lin Qiuhan was a truly simple woman. It\u2019s great that she met him first \u2014 had someone else discovered her before him, he reckoned that she would help them count the money they made by selling her.Of course, he also looked forward to Lin Qiuhan\u2019s growth as an Alchemist so he could use her for himself in the future.\u2026.Three days passed in the blink of an eye.Because of their relationship with Gu Changge, the Ancient Lin Family had become very busy over the last few days. Major forces from all over the world had come to visit them, and wanted to develop a positive relationship with them.The destruction of the Buddhist Holy Land gave a stern signal to all the forces of the Middle State, and everyone could see that it was about time the Ancient Lin Family rose to ultimate prominence.Everyone in the Ancient Lin Family walked and talked with proud smiles on their faces. No matter where they went, they would be treated as honored guests as long as they revealed their identity as the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s descendants and disciples.Although the Ancient Lin Family was already a mighty force before, but now, no one could compare to them. Of course, all of the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s people held deep reverence for Gu Changge.They knew who gave them all of their current glory.Aside from that, after she received the hint from Gu Changge, Lin Qiuhan made sure to appoint people to keep a watch over Lin Tian\u2019s corpse.What he was truly faking his death\u2026She was also skeptical about this. And over the course of the three days, she realized that there really was something strange with Lin Tian\u2019s corpse. Even though three days had passed, his body didn\u2019t show any signs of decay.It was strange.Even a cultivator of the Spirit Sea Realm should have his body stiffen and start to decay three days after death, but nothing like that happened to Lin Tian\u2019s corpse. One had to know that Lin Tian was a piece of trash who hadn\u2019t even reached the Spirit Sea Realm yet!This discovery shocked Lin Qiuhan, and she started to believe in Gu Changge\u2019s words.Lin Tian wasn\u2019t dead!He faked his death and tried to deceive everyone!This fact angered Lin Qiuhan and her heart turned cold.Not only was her brother\u2019s body taken over by some bastard, the person who did it also almost brought ruin upon their Ancient Lin Family!She couldn\u2019t wait to make mince meat out of the fiend who took over her brother\u2019s body. She wanted to slash him into a million pieces with her sword!\u2026.A dim light illuminated a damp dungeon filled with an unbearable stench. An ice-cold corpse that looked to be a youth who suddenly aged for some reason lay on the ground. Suddenly, the corpse opened its eyes and a light flashed through it.\u201cIt seems that I have escaped from the catastrophe\u2026\u201dThe corpse sat up straight and looked around at its surroundings while muttering to itself. Of course, he was none other than Lin Tian, who had escaped his death through suspended animation at the critical moment.He felt fortunate in his heart for his decisiveness.After that, he observed his surroundings and realized that he was in a dungeon. There seemed to be no one guarding on the outside.Once upon a time, he was a mighty God King who stood above all and below none; he never expected that he would have to make use of such a method to save his life.He couldn\u2019t help but laugh at himself with a hint of mockery in his voice.Still, he had survived! As long as he could hide from others, he wouldn\u2019t have to die. No, the Heavens didn\u2019t want him to die!\u201cFortunately, I wasn\u2019t cremated\u2026but they didn\u2019t bury me either. What a pity\u2026but this isn\u2019t all that bad either. When the time comes, I will pretend to not remember anything, and that should be enough to deceive everyone. With my previous life\u2019s experience, it won\u2019t be all that hard for me\u2026\u201d\u201cAs for the bastard with the Gu surname\u2026just you wait, this King will certainly pay you back sooner or later\u2026\u201dLin Tian\u2019s expression darkened as he recalled Gu Changge\u2019s face.Right now, the secret technique of suspended animation he used before was working at full force and healing his severed heart\u2019s vein. Blood started to flow through his body again, and life returned to his cold corpse.If someone were standing next to him at this moment, they would be shocked and exclaim that it was impossible!How could a dead person resurrect and regain life?It was unbelievable \u2014 a miracle!Still, Lin Tian\u2019s youth didn\u2019t return. No matter how powerful the technique might be, it would be impossible for it to make up for his lost lifespan.At the same time, the entire event confused Lin Tian. He couldn\u2019t understand what that Gu Changge held on his person? Why did the demons he summoned show such terror when they met him?This was something he never encountered in his tens of thousands of years of previous life.\u201cMove\u2026THE CORPSE MOVED\u2026\u201dRight at this time, a terrified scream sounded from outside the dungeon. The disciple of the Ancient Lin Family, who was assigned to watch over Lin Tian\u2019s corpse, walked in and saw the scene of Lin Tian sitting up straight. It gave him such a scare that he almost pissed his pants!\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[CULTIVATION REALMS]Mortal Physique \u2013 Trash Leek Lin Tian. Spirit Ocean \u2013 None worth mentioning.\u00a0(I have been calling it Spirit Sea for some dumb reason until now, wtf. I will try to fix it in the older chapters, but know that Spirit Sea and Spirit Ocean are the same.) Spirit Palace \u2013 None worth mentioning. Transcendent \u2013 Su Qingge, Ye Chen, Chu Xuan (was half-step, but I think he got through to it), other Holy Sons, Holy Maidens, and Princes, etc. Great-Transcendent \u2013 Elder-level Figures. Saint \u2013 Sect Masters, Patriarchs. Conferred Lord \u2013 Gu Changge. Conferred King \u2013 None Yet. False God \u2013 None Yet..\u00a0Unknown.\u00a0Realms.\u00a0Here God King \u2013 Old Ming.Thanks to SKYTH in the Discord server, I was able to see that Spirit Ocean and Spirit Sea mistake. My memory isn\u2019t all that good it seems. It will be fixed in the earlier chapters and will be treated as Spirit Sea Realm in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, her heart turned cold, and she went to find Gu Changge and explained everything to him.\u201cSince Lin Tian has resurrected, then we should go and have a look at who is the one occupying his body\u2026\u201dGu Changge thought for a while and said to Lin Qiuhan.There was no way he wouldn\u2019t be interested in this matter. After all, he had waited for three full days to watch Lin Tian return to life. A great show was about to be staged in front of him, so how could Gu Changge miss it?By the end of today, Lin Tian will no longer have anymore value as a leek, either.Wasn\u2019t he a mighty figure who reincarnated?Since he was that mighty, why did he have to take over the body of a trash? Was he not satisfied when taking over the body of a normal person?\u201cIt will be as you say, Young Lord.\u201dLin Qiuhan agreed.Soon, Lin Qiuhan and Gu Changge arrived in the dungeon. The Lin Family disciple responsible for guarding the place was looking around while trembling, clearly frightened by everything that was happening.\u201cI pay my respects to the Young Miss! I pay my respect to the Young Lord\u2026\u201dAfter saluting the two of them, he quickly ran away from the gloomy place without daring to look behind him.\u201cDon\u2019t talk about this before anyone else!\u201dLin Qiuhan commanded the disciple who was escaping at full speed. Matters of death and the dead coming back to life were too weird, and couldn\u2019t be explained in simple terms, so she didn\u2019t want to attract too much unnecessary attention.When Lin Tian saw Lin Qiuhan and Gu Changge arrive in the dungeon, he felt unease bud in his heart. Still, he put on a puzzled expression and looked around in confusion.It was how he planned to deceive Lin Qiuhan. With the memories from his Predecessor, he could easily deceive this simple and kind sister of his as long as he didn\u2019t show any flaws.As for Gu Changge, he wasn\u2019t too sure on how to deal with him.This bastard with the surname of Gu was too incalculable. If he wanted to deceive him, then he would need to put in a bit more effort. Who knows? He might even see through him if he overacted.The mighty God King, Lin Tian, who had experienced hundreds of battles in his life, couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasiness claw at his heart right now.\u201cSister, why am I here?\u201d\u201cI remember that I was in the Academy\u2026how did I end up here\u2026\u201d\u201cWho is this person beside you? I have never seen him before\u2026\u201dHaving thought through his plan, Lin Tian opened his mouth and asked with just the right amount of confusion in his tone and on his face.\u2018Hoh! So you are gonna pretend to not have any memories?\u2019Gu Changge laughed in his heart as he watched his act, but his expression showed no change.He stayed quiet.Instead of an outsider like him doing it himself, it would be better if Lin Qiuhan tore apart Lin Tian\u2019s disguise with her own hands. If he guessed correctly, the original Lin Tian must have been concerned about and obsessed with Lin Qiuhan.If he received Lin Qiuhan\u2019s wrath and hatred, then the original Lin Tian\u2019s will won\u2019t be able to sit still\u2026after all, one must solve the Predecessor\u2019s obsession to truly seize their body.An obsession that couldn\u2019t be resolved would naturally turn into a thorn and fight against the one trying to take over the body.[Hehe!]With this, Lin Tian had reached a dead end since he would never be able to solve this obsession. As for the last two hundred Points of Fortune Value he held? Gu Changge would be able to obtain those without a hitch.What\u2019s more? He could also complete his mission of killing a Favored Son of Heaven!After all, if you killed a Favored Son of Heaven after thoroughly taking away his Fortune Value, the System would reward you with an additional Heavenly Reward. Gu Changge was looking forward to what he will receive.As for siblings murdering each other in cold blood? Gu Changge believed that something like that would never happen as long as the previous Lin Tian\u2019s obsession didn\u2019t die off.The current Lin Tian couldn\u2019t do anything to hurt Lin Qiuhan.\u201cWhy are you still pretending?\u201cLin Qiuhan\u2019s sad heart surged with cold hatred as she watched the old face that resembled her brother\u2019s.\u201cSister, what are you talking about? Why can\u2019t I understand anything you say?\u201dLin Tian was stunned by her words, and showed a bewildered expression as if he couldn\u2019t comprehend what she was talking about. With some fear, he looked around him and asked again, \u201cSister, why aren\u2019t you answering me? Why am I locked up in a dungeon\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan\u2019s expression was frozen like an ice cap, and she didn\u2019t utter a single word.Had she not received Young Lord Gu\u2019s reminder, she would have most likely been deceived by the current Lin Tian. She would have truly believed that he didn\u2019t know what had happened over the last few days.Those who occupied someone else\u2019s body could easily devour their memories. It was easy for them to pretend to have lost their memories.\u201cSister, I am really your little brother, Lin Tian! Why don\u2019t you believe me\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you remember the time when you were six years old, and father reprimanded you, so you came to me to vent your complains\u2026\u201dNo matter what Lin Tian said, and how he tried, Lin Qiuhan\u2019s expression showed no signs of changing in his favor. Instead, her face turned colder and colder with every word he uttered.Had he kept his mouth shut, everything would have been fine\u2026but now that he uttered all those words, the sadness in Lin Qiuhan\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but compound, and she recalled the days of yesteryear.\u2018It\u2019s having a negative effect\u2026\u2019Lin Tian didn\u2019t take long to notice that all his attempts were in vain, and he realized that something had gone awry. His heart further sank when he saw Gu Changge\u2019s playful expression.He couldn\u2019t deceive the two of them in any way!Could it be that he escaped a catastrophe, only to fall into another? Was he going to die here and today?His heart was unwilling to accept such a fate.What\u2019s more? He even sensed the obsession of the original Lin Tian develop deep resentment towards him, as it tried to push him out.His remnant soul was getting entangled with the remnant obsession of his predecessor.\u201cShut up!\u201dLin Qiuhan finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. Her eyes turned red, and she growled in a cold tone, \u201cYou are a damned beast!\u201d\u201cSister\u2026\u201dLin Tian\u2019s expression turned slack for a moment, and he couldn\u2019t help but mutter to himself, \u201cWhy? I have never hurt you\u2026I have never even thought of hurting you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are you treating me like this?\u201dRight now, he couldn\u2019t even tell whether he was the Heaven Slaughter God King or the waste named Lin Tian. His remnant soul and the Predecessor\u2019s obsession were becoming inseparable.[Ding! Lin Tian has received a backlash from his Predecessor\u2019s obsession and lost control of his body! He lost 200 Points of Fortune Value! You received 1000 Destiny Points!][Reminder! The Favored Son of Heaven has run out of Fortune Value! You receive addition Heavenly Rewards on killing him right now!]The System\u2019s Prompt rang inside Gu Changge\u2019s mind right at this moment, telling him that the time to reap his rewards had come. He put on a gentle and comforting expression, and softly said to Lin Qiuhan, \u201cI know you can\u2019t do it, so let me be a villain for you. For now, you should go outside.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan\u2019s heart moved, and she walked out with reddened eyes.Although she desired to kill the bastard in front of her from the bottom of her heart, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to truly do it since he had the same face as her brother.After Lin Qiuhan left, Gu Changge approached Lin Tian with his hands behind his back, and said with a faint smirk, \u201cDo you know why I didn\u2019t let them cremate or bury you?\u201d\u201cYou knew I was faking my death? Gu, just who are you? Why are you doing this?\u201dLin Tian couldn\u2019t help but roar towards him. Right now, he was like a wild beast ready to pounce on whoever his gaze fell upon.\u201cWhy am I doing this? Now, why could I be doing this? Isn\u2019t it all because you wanted to kill me?\u201dGu Changge asked him, and his eyes darkened at the same time. It was as if hundreds of millions of black lightnings were flashing through his pupils. With his pupils looking like a devil\u2019s, he watched Lin Tian.\u201cWho the hell are you? Why can you use such a method\u2026\u201dLin Tian was frightened by Gu Changge\u2019s eyes, feeling like he was falling into a dark abyss. He felt as if a terrifying vortex was trying to eat him up.This person with the surname of GU had an incomparably demonic nature, and he seemed to be surrounded by hundreds of millions of demons who were ready spread chaos in the world!He, a mighty God King, had never come across such a terrifying sight before in his life.Lin Qiuhan putting her trust in him was far too dangerous!Lin Tian felt another burst of pain as this reality hit him. He hated this feeling!\u201cA dead man doesn\u2019t need to know so much.\u201dGu Changge indifferently looked at Lin Tian, and placed his hand on between his eyebrows.\u201cWhat sort of sorcery is this\u2026AH!!!\u201dLin Tian was so frightened that he couldn\u2019t help but scream. Gu Changge\u2019s palm passed right through to his Sea of Consciousness, and a jet-black brilliance bloomed inside him like an avenue of disaster.[Hum!]In the next moment, the darkness flashed, and a terrifying force sucked his soul inside it as if a bottle sucking in water. His remnant soul disappeared in an instant, and Lin Tian\u2019s body fell without life once more.\u201cThis fellow turned out to be a God King in his previous life\u2026the taste of his soul isn\u2019t bad!\u201dGu Changge couldn\u2019t help but praise with his eyes closed in relish.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFirst Kill Reward Chest; Halo of the Destined Heavenly Villain!Gu Changge felt no scruples in devouring the mighty God King\u2019s remnant soul with his [Immortal-Devouring Demon Art]. He closed his eyes and enjoyed the feeling of fullness that came with it.At the same time, he looked through the memories of the so-called Heaven Slaughter God King.The greatest weapon in a mighty figure\u2019s arsenal, when they reincarnated into the body of a waste like Lin Tian, was their experience and knowledge from their previous lives, their deep understanding of the cultivation realms, and immense combat experience.What else could they rely on beside those, after all?But now, all of that belonged to Gu Changge. The [Immortal-Devouring Demon Art] could not only devour the Origin of the other party, but it also devoured everything about them.The main reason he asked Lin Qiuhan to leave the place was that he didn\u2019t want to expose this technique before anyone else. There were many methods to search through someone else\u2019s soul in the Upper Realm, so he wouldn\u2019t feel at ease if someone other than him knew his secret.\u201cThe pleasure of strengthening my Primordial Spirit by swallowing a God King\u2019s remnant soul is truly incomparable\u2026\u201d\u201cThe world will surely not tolerate the existence of the [Immortal-Devouring Demon Art]. If it\u2019s exposed that I posses this art, not even the Heavens will be able to protect me\u2026\u201dGu Changge\u2019s Primordial Spirit grew in strength at a rapid pace, and before long, it had even surpassed the strength of a Conferred King\u2019s Primordial Spirit.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but relish in joy at the comfort that came with the increase in his strength. At the same time, a bunch of System Prompts sounded in his mind.[Ding! You have killed your first Favored Son of Heaven, and triggered extra Heavenly Rewards by clearing all of their Fortune Value in the process! Reward calculations are in progress\u2026][Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received a Heavenly Dao Reward Chest, 100 Points of Fortune Value, and 500 Destiny Points!][Ding! As this was your first kill, you have also received the First Kill Reward Chest!][Ding! You have unlocked the ability to exchange Fortune Value for Destiny Points! You can now exchange your Fortune Value for Destiny Points at 1-to-10 ratio!][1][1: 1 Fortune Value = 10 Destiny Points.]Gu Changge\u2019s interest soared as he heard all the Prompts. In addition to the Heavenly Dao Reward Chest, he also got a First Kill Reward Chest.What\u2019s more? He could even exchange Fortune Value for Destiny Points now. This brought another trump card under his sleeve. Wasn\u2019t there a saying:\u00a0\u2018sacrifice thy luck and the Heavens will protect thee!\u2019He was a villain, so if he encountered an unavoidable crises in the future, he might just be able to get through it by exchanging his Fortune Value for Destiny Points.Of course, Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t use this feature unless absolutely necessary. After all, he understood the importance of having a lot of Fortune Value. Without Fortune Value, he wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with the Favored Children of Heaven with ease.\u2018Open the First Kill Reward Chest!\u2019Gu Changge commanded.He wanted to see what he could receive. After all, this was nothing different from a lottery or a gacha game that he knew from his past life. He couldn\u2019t wait to open the mysterious treasure chest.With a flash of golden light, a golden chest appeared in front of his eyes and then exploded with a bang![Ding! Congratulations, Host, for having great fortune! You have received: Fortune Plundering Card x3, One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x1, System\u2019s Reward Calculations Multiplication Card x1!]The System\u2019s cold, mechanical voice sounded in his ears.\u2018[Fortune Plundering Card]?\u2019A strange expression appeared on Gu Changge\u2019s face as he read through the [Fortune Plundering Card\u2019s] description. The [Fortune Plundering Card] could be used to target a Favored Son of Heaven; it had a small probability of failure, depending on the Favored Son of Heaven\u2019s status, but if it succeeded, then all of the Favored Son of Heaven\u2019s Fortune Value will be cleared in one fell swoop.Not only will it be cleared, but a corresponding amount will also be awarded to him!If it failed, then, well, he gained nothing and lost one [Fortune Plundering Card].\u2018As for this [System\u2019s Reward Calculations Multiplication Card]\u2026if it\u2019s used when the System is calculating rewards, the reward will be randomly multiplied by a value that could be anywhere from 0.1 (loss)[2] to double, triple, ten times, or even a hundred times higher\u2026\u2019[2: that \u2018(loss)\u2019 in the above paragraph wasn\u2019t in the original text. I added it to make sure you understand it will be a loss if the System multiplies his rewards by any value less than 1 as 100\u00d70.1 is 10.]Gu Changge checked the functionality of the other reward he received, and clicked his tongue.It was also something that depended on Fortune. But considering his experience from the two gachas[3] before, his Fortune wasn\u2019t all that bad in the System\u2019s point of view.[3: Novice Gift Pack + First Kill Reward Chest.]He planned to use the second card when he dealt with Ye Chen.As for the [Fortune Plundering Card], it was obviously a good reward. After all, he has to put effort in suppressing the Favored Children of Heaven, and give them continuous setbacks, whenever he wants to squeeze their Fortune Value, but with this [Fortune Plundering Card], he will be able to save himself all that trouble.Of course, there was a chance that it might fail.Gu Changge went to the System\u2019s Shop and took a look at the [Fortune Plundering Card\u2019s] value, and found that it was up for sale for a whopping ten thousand Destiny Points![Holy Frick!]That was to say, if he wanted to break even, he would need to come across a Favored Child of Heaven with at least 2000 Points of Fortune Value.That wasn\u2019t too unrealistic though. Gu Changge guessed that the Favored Children of Heaven he would meet in the future wouldn\u2019t be blessed with a little amount of Fortune Value.The Azure Lower Realm where he was at right now was simply too weak. Among the myriad Lower Realms in the Universe, it was merely a small realm among the Thousand Minor Lower Realms. Even False God Realms could break through the Void\u2019s barrier and Ascend to the Upper Realm.The larger Lower Realms, such as the ones among the Thousand Middle Lower Realms, had a higher boundary. For example, the world where the Heaven Slaughter God King originated from\u2026there, one had to reach the God King Realm before they could Ascend to the Upper Realm.As for the Upper Realm, the place where Gu Changge himself came from\u2026it was a complex world that acted as a hub connecting all of the Thousand Minor Lower Realms, the Thousand Middle Lower Realms, and the Thousand Major Lower Realms.Afterwards, Gu Changge opened the Heavenly Dao Reward Chest to see if he would get something related to the Favored Children of Heaven, as he guessed.A golden light flashed in front of his eyes again, and the System\u2019s Prompt sounded in his mind once more.[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving the Halo of a Favored Child of Heaven! The Halo has been automatically transformed by the System, and you have received the Halo of a Destined Heavenly Villain!][Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving a God Kings Heart\u2026]\u2018[Halo of a Destined Heavenly Villain]?\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t care about anything else, and all of his attention fell upon the first reward. It\u2019s description immediately piqued his interest.[Halo of a Destined Heavenly Villain establishes you as a Villain fated to exterminate the Favored Children of Heaven! You can now ignore the remifications of dealing with a Favored Child of Heaven when your luck isn\u2019t as high as them\u2026]\u2018What does that mean?\u2019Gu Changge raised his eyebrows and questioned the System.[When the difference between the Villain\u2019s and the Protagonist\u2019s Fortune Value is too high, the Villain will suffer from a Fortune Backlash if his strength surpasses the Protagonist by too much. That\u2019s how the Heavenly Dao protects the Protagonists, but the Halo of a Destined Heavenly Villain nullifies this mechanism\u2026]The System explained.\u2018So that\u2019s how it is! When I first transmigrated over, my Fortune Value was too low, but my strength was enough to completely overwhelm Ye Chen, so the Heavenly Dao decided to use this Fortune Backlash to stop me from going overboard\u2026\u2019Everything started to add up right now.Now that he had a high amount of Fortune Value, he naturally didn\u2019t need to care about receiving a Fortune Backlash at this time. But who could guarantee a situation like the previous one won\u2019t happen again in the future?Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but feel comfortable as he realized that a hidden danger to his life had been nipped in the bud by this [Halo of the Destined Heavenly Villain]!As for the [God King\u2019s Heart]? It was the cultivation of mind of a cultivator who had reached the God King Realm and honed his state of mind for thousands of years.In Gu Changge\u2019s opinion, Lin Tian\u2019s [God King\u2019s Heart] wouldn\u2019t be all that good, but since it was a reward from the System, it shouldn\u2019t be all that bad either.Gu Changge directly chose the option to fuse with it. In the very next moment, he felt a mass of warm light wrap around his body. His consciousness shook, and he felt as if he had lived through tens of thousands of years as scene after scene flashed through his mind.At first he thought that he was about to reincarnate or something, but soon, his muddled mind recovered.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but frown.How come the [God King\u2019s Heart] made little to no change to his state of mind? Only his ability to feel his surroundings and comprehend stuff improved by a bit, it seemed.Well, as long as it increases!After all, he was a transmigrator. Although he was quick at adapting to the various situations, he wasn\u2019t omniscient. The [God King\u2019s Heart] should save him a lot of time in cultivating his state of mind in the future, he estimated.The state of mind was something as illusory as Fortune Value, after all, and everyone had a different understanding of it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

First, he could directly kill them off. This was the easiest method, but he will only receive a part of their Fortune Value, and there won\u2019t be any additional Heavenly Rewards for squeezing them dry either.Unless he cleared their Fortune Value, it would be difficult for him to seize their opportunities.The second method was to suppress the Favored Children of Heaven with one setback after another, just like he did with the two leeks until now. He could earn Destiny Points, and also receive massive Fortune Value.Although the second method was troublesome, the profits made up for the effort.Gu Changge immediately knew which method to choose.With that over, he walked out of the dungeon with an indifferent expression. At the same time, he called out for his Attributes Panel in his mind.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Host: Gu ChanggeHalo: Destined Heavenly VillainIdentity: True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao PalaceBloodline: Devil Heart, Dao BoneCultivation: Conferred Lord (Middle Stage)Mystical Abilities:Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex (7th Layer)Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple (Talent)Myriad Changes Demonic Physique (Talent)Immortal-Devouring Demon Art\u2026Destiny Points: 4500Fortune Value: 450 (Dark)System Shop: OpenWarehouse:Domain-Traversing Talisman x1One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x2Fortune Plundering Card x3System\u2019s Reward Calculations Multiplication Card x1\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2018I earned a lot after this time\u2019s harvest\u2026\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but smile as he read through his stats.\u2018I can do a lot with 4500 Destiny Points! The [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] should be appearing any time now, so I should think of how to deal with Ye Chen as well. After all, there\u2019s no more value in keeping him alive now\u2026\u2019\u2018I will also need to prepare some other things\u2026if I return without preparations, then my situation might just worsen further.\u2019Afterwards, Gu Changge frowend and started to think about the affairs of the Upper Realm. He had to prepare a plan to solve his issues up there.Although he had the backing of the Gu Family, and was also a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, his position in the Upper Realm wasn\u2019t all that solid. After all, his motives behind joining the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace weren\u2019t all that pure.The reason why he was only a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and not their successor, was because of Gu Changge\u2019s background and identity. Many of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s higher-ups had a wary attitude towards him.He had to find a way to stabilize his position after returning to the Upper Realm. Otherwise, he might just die before he has a chance to play another Favored Child of Heaven to death!Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was an Immortal Heritage in the Upper Realm that had never been shaken throughout their existence over the long river of time, so there was no need to speculate about their true might.Many Immortal Ancient Families, Supreme Immortal Dynasties, and Grand Sects tried every means to send their descendants and disciples into the Heavenly Dao Immortal Sect for a chance to rise higher.Although Gu Changge had the Gu Family\u2019s support, it wasn\u2019t easy for him to take charge of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.Of course, these were matters he would only need to consider after he returned to the Upper Realm. For now, he could take it easy and not think too much.\u201cYoung Lord\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan had been waiting for Gu Changge outside the dungeon. As soon as she saw him walking out, she called out to him. Her eyes were red, and grief weighed down on her heart.\u201cIt\u2019s alright! I have already solved Lin Tian\u2019s matter for you. I have also eliminated the remnant soul of the one who was occupying his body.\u201dGu Changge comforted her with a gentle smile.\u201cThank you, Young Lord Gu! Pardon me for troubling you with such a minor matter.\u201dLin Qiuhan\u2019s replied with some comfort.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize; it was a minor matter.\u201dGu Changge spoke with a warm voice, and his gentle smile showed no change. Even if Lin Qiuhan had asked to deliver the final blow to Lin Tian, he wouldn\u2019t have agreed. After all, he wouldn\u2019t get any Heavenly Rewards if he wasn\u2019t the one dealing the final blow.Not only did he receive the Heavenly Rewards, but he also got to brush up on Lin Qiuhan\u2019s favorability like this. In the future, she would work for him with sincerity, so it was a profit Gu Changge wasn\u2019t willing to let go of!\u201cIt would be better if you help your brother return to his origins as soon as possible (burial). Since his body wasn\u2019t occupied for too long, there\u2019s a chance his soul hasn\u2019t thoroughly dissipated, and he might be able to enter the cycle of reincarnation\u2026\u201dGu Changge\u2019s warm smile appeared even more comforting as he said that.Of course, this talk about entering the cycle of reincarnation was nothing but a hoax he spoke merely to comfort Lin Qiuhan. After all, the original Lin Tian\u2019s soul was completely devoured by the Heaven Slaughter God King when he took over his body. How else would he be plagued by the Predecessor\u2019s obsession?And when Gu Changge devoured the Heaven Slaughter God King\u2019s remnant spirit, he also devoured the original Lin Tian\u2019s soul.\u201cUnderstood. I will order someone to help Little Tian safely return to his origins\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan said and turned around, never expecting that Gu Changge would be so considerate towards her.Gu Changge\u2019s smile disappeared as he watched her walk away. A simple woman like Lin Qiuhan wasn\u2019t all that hard to deal with. A good face, eloquent speech, and gentle care would be enough to make them sink.After that, Gu Changge took it easy for the next few days. First, he spent 3000 Destiny Points to raise his cultivation base to the Late Stage of the Conferred Lord Realm.Although the improvement wasn\u2019t too great compared to the Middle Stage, but for a supreme prodigy like him, the increase in his combat power was exponential. It couldn\u2019t be explained just with Realms and whatnot.Just because Gu Changge rarely made a move, it didn\u2019t mean he had low combat power. It\u2019s just that he didn\u2019t need to make a move as his aura alone was enough to suppress everyone around him.If he desired, he was sure he could easily obliterate even people in the Conferred King Realm.Of course, the price wasn\u2019t small for such a minor breakthrough. Gu Changge estimated that he would need to spend an even more terrifying amount of Destiny Points if he wanted to enter the Peak Stage of the Conferred Lord Realm \u2014 he might need to fork out around 5000 Destiny Points.Still, it was worth the price!His comprehension of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex had been almost pushed to the Eighth Layer. In his memories, he didn\u2019t recall anyone among his peers who had reached the Eighth Layer of the Dao Codex in the Upper Realm.Of course, there was a chance someone might have made a breakthrough during the time he was down in the Lower Realm. He had already been here for almost half a year now. Either way, Gu Changge believed that his speed at breaking through and comprehending the higher stages was already as fast as it could get.\u2026\u2026Less than three days remained to the beginning of the Middle State\u2019s Heavenly Geniuses Dao Conference. The Moon-facing Ancient City brimmed with more and more guests. Cultivators and mortals from various Sects, Clans, and Dynasties packed the streets.After the destruction of the Buddhist Holy Land, more and more forces of the world developed reverence for the Young Lord from the Upper Realm. At the same time, they all thought:\u00a0\u2018won\u2019t we soar to Heaven if we can please the Young Lord?\u2019They couldn\u2019t suppress this desire after they saw the current appearance of the Ancient Lin Family. No matter where their people went, no one dared to offend them\u2026no, others actually had to be subservient before them. All of them put on domineering appearances, and their noses were almost about to touch the Heavens out of arrogance.In this dog-eat-dog world, only might was right!Many forces had plans to butter up with the Young Lord and rise above the rest.\u2026\u2026Many young creatures with different appearances sat together in a pavilion shrouded by divine-looking mist. Some had wings on their backs, some had scales on their foreheads, some appeared sacred and divine, and others had their limbs covered in flames.Divine brilliance surrounded all of them, and they radiated ferocious auras. The Holy Sons and Maidens of the mighty Holy Lands of the Middle State couldn\u2019t amount to anything in front of them.They weren\u2019t even eligible to be compared to them.The weakest among them was already at the Great-Transcendent Realm, and had the qualifications to look down on people from the older generations of the Middle State, let alone the younger ones.In the vicinity of this group of creatures hid old servants with terrifying auras and force of oppression. If the cultivators outside saw them all, they might piss their pants in horror.The Ancient Sacred Mountains!All of these young creatures were from the Ancient Sacred Mountains, and held a terrifying background. Right now, they were busy discussing the events that took place in the Middle State.\u201cI never thought he would directly obliterate the Buddhist Holy Land! Just what is the origin of that youth who is said to have descended from the Upper Realm\u2026\u201dA young creature with wings on his back shook his head with a look of pity. Of course, there was only pity in his eyes and he held no sympathy for the Buddhist Holy Land. To him, the Buddhist Holy Land wasn\u2019t worth jack crap, and he couldn\u2019t be bothered about their destruction.\u201cNo matter what his background, I will make him pay the price for offending me!\u201dA beautiful girl with an indifferent expression, and eyes full of awe-inspiring killing intent, put her snow-white long sword on the table before her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had exquisite and gorgeous features, slender, long legs, and an extremely aloof aura.She didn\u2019t appear to be all that old, and looked to be only around seventeen to eighteen years old. Her eyes were completely different from those of the humans, and appeared like colorful beads that beautifully swam around.She appeared to be the leader of all the young creatures of the Ancient Sacred Mountains. Her identity wasn\u2019t simple, and her standing in the Ancient Sacred Mountains was quite hight.Everyone watched her with deep respect.As he heard the beauty\u2019s words, the creature with wings on his back waved his hands and said, \u201cMiss Liuli, you can rest assured! That brat who came from the Upper Realm might have some background, but he\u2019s nothing before me and our Ancient Sacred Mountains!\u201d\u201cSince he dared to offend Miss Liuli, he can forget about returning to his den!\u201d\u201cHaha! Our Ancient Sacred Mountains weren\u2019t born recently, so the Azure Realm might have forgotten our existence after we went into retreat eons ago. Once we move, they will realize who the true overlords of the Azure Realm are! All of them are nothing but our slaves\u2026\u201d\u201cHow dare a brat and his slave cause a ruckus in the Middle State right under our nose and get away unscathed?\u201dThe rest of the creatures also nodded in agreement when they heard his proclamations. They stood with their heads high, and talked about everything outside the Ancient Sacred Mountains with disdain.In their opinion, the so-called Holy Lands and Ancient Families of the Middle State were nothing more than a bunch of anthills that could be stomped to oblivion at any moment.The Ancient Sacred Mountains were related to the Upper Realm, and they had many False God Realm masters hidden among their ranks.Some of the major families backing them (from the Upper Realm) even ruled over endless territory. They had existed since ancient times, and their heritage could be traced back to an era when the Azure Lower Realm didn\u2019t even exist. Even Supreme Sects and Immortal Heritages had to treat them with courtesy.The girl in purple nodded her head and said nothing as she heard the winged youth\u2019s words. At the same time, her hatred and killing intent intensified.After that, the other creatures started to talk among themselves about different matters. Some even discussed how they could go and capture the brat from the Upper Realm and present him before the girl in purple.The girl in purple shook her head, and said with frosty eyes, \u201cI want to personally see that person! How dare he be so bold as to harm my Brother Ye Chen to such an extent? Since he dared to commit such a crime, there\u2019s no way I will let him go unscathed!\u201dEveryone nodded their heads when they heard her proclamation.\u201cNo matter how great that brat\u2019s background might be in the Upper Realm, can it be better than Lady Liuli\u2019s? He will surely be kneeling before you and begging for mercy\u2026\u201dThe girl in purple hailed from an extremely esteemed background; she was the direct descendant of a terrifying Family in the Upper Realm.Her name was Ye Liuli!When she was three years old, she was sent down to the Lower Realm for an unknown reason, and was raised by the Ancient Sacred Mountains. When she was six years old, she was sent to the family of an old servant\u2019s descendants due to unrest and turmoil in the Ancient Sacred Mountains.The family where they sent her was none other than the Ye Family where Ye Chen came from.During her time in the Ye Family, she grew up together with Ye Chen and developed a deep emotional attachment to him. Unfortunately, whe she was thirteen, she was brought back to the Ancient Sacred Mountains for secluded cultivation that lasted five years.When Ye Liuli finally left her seclusion, she decided to immediately find her Brother Ye Chen. But\u2026that\u2019s when she heard a lot of ugly rumors about him.The rumors disturbed her, and left her shocked and enraged!Her Brother Ye Chen had provoked a youth who had descended from the Upper Realm, and he was forced to fled to the Middle State from the Eastern Wilderness to seek refuge and save his life.In her opinion, the rumors were sheer slander!It was nonsense that he coveted the Eastern Wilderness\u2019s number one beauty! What did they mean by saying that he was a toad who wanted to eat swan mean?Her Brother Ye Chen was a honest, kind, and determined youth who would never do such a thing.Those accusations had to be false!Even worse? The Buddhist Holy Land that was related to her Brother Ye Chen was obliterated from existence, and that compounded her rage and murderous desires.After she calmed down, Ye Liuli traveled all the way from the Ancient Sacred Mountains to the Moon-facing Ancient City to see that young man from the Upper Realm after receiving the news that he was here.She wanted to see how many heads and arms this young man from the Upper Realm boasted, and at the same time, she would avenge her Brother Ye Chen!\u201cAunt Xue, I want to know where Brother Ye Chen is\u2026\u201dYe Liuli suddenly said to the empty air behind her in an icy tone.[Hum!]The void rippled, and a middle-aged beauty appeared out of thin air. This ability of hers was already something in the domain of the False God Realm cultivators.A look of helplessness flashed through the woman\u2019s eyes as she heard her lady\u2019s words, but the woman named Aunt Xue still responded with a soft voice, \u201cMy Lady, I am not sure where Ye Chen is hiding right now; I have only received information that he is somewhere in the Middle State.\u201dHaving said that, the middle-aged woman obviously didn\u2019t care about that matter in her heart. In her eyes, a mere Ye Chen wasn\u2019t worthy of her noble and esteemed Young Lady!Once she found Ye Chen, she would make sure that he didn\u2019t come in contact with her Young Lady. A measly Ye Chen didn\u2019t have the qualifications to even gaze upon her esteemed Young Lady\u2019s visage, let alone get her attention.The two of them were from completely different worlds, and their fates would never cross in the future.\u201cReally?\u201d Ye Liuli muttered to herself in sadness, \u201cBrother Ye Chen must have suffered a lot over the past\u2026\u201dA dazed expression appeared on Ye Liuli\u2019s face as she recalled the past. Due to her noble birth, the people of the Ye Family didn\u2019t even dare to talk to her. They were always afraid and respectful towards her, and it was only her Brother Ye Chen who didn\u2019t treat her differently.Moreover, whenever he chanced upon something interesting, he would always share it with her. If there was anything delicious to eat, he would give it to her before tasting it himself.Once, in order to pick a fruit for her, he went deep into the forest in the Ye Family\u2019s back mountain and almost lost his life.\u2026\u2026As she recalled the past, the sadness and unease bearing down on Ye Liuli\u2019s heart intensified. She was afraid that she might not be able to bear the guilt if something happened to her Brother Ye Chen.\u201cMy Lady, you will have to return to the Upper Realm sooner or later \u2014 you are destined to be a Phoenix who will soar to the Ninth Heaven! Ye Chen might not even reach the False God Realm in this life, so I must advice you to\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged woman named Aunt Xue couldn\u2019t help but try to persuade her Young Lady.In her opinion, that brat named Ye Chen was no good person. He was a treacherous and tricky scum who had learned to fool innocent girls from a young age.Only those young and handsome talents from the Upper Realm could be a good match for her Young Lady.Ye Liuli, on the other hand, shook her head and replied with a firm tone, \u201cAunt Xue, you don\u2019t need to say anymore. I know all of you look down on Brother Ye Chen, but I believe in him! He will definitely soar to the Heavens in the future.\u201d\u201cI still remember what he said:\u00a0\u2018The river flows thirty years to the East, and back thirty years to the West! Don\u2019t you dare bully me just because I am down right now!\u2019\u201c [1]Aunt Xue felt helpless and didn\u2019t know how else to persuade her Young Lady.She decided not to think too much about this matter. Once her Young Lady met the geniuses from the Upper Realm, she will realize that a mere Ye Chen is nothing compared to them.\u2018The river flows thirty years to the East, and back thirty years to the West! Don\u2019t you dare bully me just because I am down right now!\u2019\u00a0\u2014 he said?But what if the river flowed for thirty-thousand years?Some were born to stand above the rest, never to be reached by those below.\u201cAunt Xue, let\u2019s go and see this so-called Young Lord from the Upper Realm. I will leave his False God Realm servant to you.\u201dYe Liuli\u2019s expression turned as frosty as a glacier, and she gave out her command. She will go to the Ancient Lin Family and deal with that\u00a0\u2018Young Lord\u2019\u00a0to avenge her Brother Ye Chen.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[FOOTNOTES][1]: It means that a person\u2019s destiny doesn\u2019t stay the same for their entire life. If someone is down right now, they might just reach the top of the world tomorrow, so you shouldn\u2019t bully them today, lest they obliterate you tomorrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She also knew that the real strength of the brat from the Upper Realm\u2019s servant might not be limited to the False God Realm.But in the Lower Realm, the world\u2019s laws wouldn\u2019t allow him to exert strength beyond the False God Realm. As for Aunt Xue? She was also from the Upper Realm and her strength was far beyond a mere False God Realm, too! She wouldn\u2019t be dispatched to protect her otherwise, after all.One had to know that even the Ancestor of the Ancient Sacred Mountains had to behave respectfully in front of Aunt Xue; he didn\u2019t even dare to breathe loudly in her presence.\u201cLeave it to me, My Lady!\u201dAunt Xue nodded in response to the beauty\u2019s words. Since it was a command from her Lady, there was no way she would reject it.Since the other party could descend to the Lower Realm, they mustn\u2019t be small fries in the Upper Realm, but she couldn\u2019t care less about their background. Even if they had some background, they surely wouldn\u2019t have the guts to go against their Ancient Immortal Family.Soon, all of them left the pavilion and headed towards the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s estate. The sudden appearance of the Ancient Sacred Mountains\u2019 creatures in the world caused a sensation in the Moon-facing Ancient City once people realized they were heading towards the Ancient Lin Family with murderous intentions.It shocked many cultivators, and they rushed towards the Ancient Lin Family to find out the reason behind such hostility. Many concluded that a major event was about to transpire, and it was most-likely related to the Young Lord from the Upper Realm!\u2026\u2026Inside the Ancient Lin Family, all the structures stood peacefully, but one of the palace appeared far more solemn and majestic. Inside this palace, Gu Changge sat on a chair and leisurely drank tea. By his side, Su Qingge gently peeled spiritual fruits and fed them to him.From time to time, Gu Changge would tease Su Qingge, prompting her into secretly rolling her eyes at him. Still, she felt her mood lighten.Over the last few days, Lin Qiuhan\u2019s terrifying talent for Alchemy had finally flourished. It proved the saying:\u00a0\u2018gold will shine wherever it sits.\u2019Without guidance from any famous Alchemist, she was able to refine medicinal pills that could only be refined by an Alchemist who had practiced for decades. And she did all that by merely studying the Elementary-level [Pill Dao] technique he gave her.Sheer effort couldn\u2019t compare to true genius, if true genius also worked hard. Lin Qiuhan\u2019s talent in Alchemy could bring many genius Alchemists to shame.This strengthened Gu Changge\u2019s resolve of bringing Lin Qiuhan back with him, and training her for himself. A word or two from him would be enough to make Lin Qiuhan happy for a long time, after all!With Gu Changge implicitly backing her, the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s Patriarch no longer had the guts to stop Lin Qiuhan from practicing Alchemy. Instead, he used the Family\u2019s full might to help her study without any worries.Everyone in the Ancient Lin Family could tell that they had to depend on Gu Changge\u2019s liking for Lin Qiuhan if they wanted to climb further up the stairway to Heaven.\u2026\u2026Right at this time, an earthquake from the outside shook the Ancient Lin Family. It shocked everyone in the Lin Family.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWho is so audacious?!\u201d\u201cWho are you? How dare you break into our Lin Family\u2019s estate and court death?\u201dPeople from the Ancient Lin Family roared towards their\u00a0\u2018guests.\u2019Right now, the Ancient Lin Family was no longer the same as they were in the past. After their Ancestor took action and exterminated the Buddhist Holy Land, their Family had risen higher in the world, and everyone in the Lin Family had their noses touching the sky.On normal days, any cultivator who passed by the Lin Family\u2019s estate would be extremely respectful and tremble at their sight. It was the first time they came across such undisguised hostility.This was a challenge to the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s authority![Boom!]Many Elders of the Ancient Lin Family appeared high above in the sky. Golden rays of brilliance flashed through their eyes, and radiated from their bodies, as they showed off their might in a bid to suppress the newcomers.They paid great attention to face, so such an action was tantamount to humiliating them in their own turf.\u201cHehe! You weaklings from the Little Lin Family, why aren\u2019t you coming out to pay your respects when our Ancient Sacred Mountains have come to your door?\u201dA tall creature with scales on his forehead sneered outside the Ancient Lin Family, and his voice spread far and wide. His thunderous roar shocked many cultivators on the streets of the Moon-facing Ancient City, and they felt their blood surge and go into disarray.It horrified them.As expected of the Ancient Sacred Mountains \u2014 even their youngsters were almighty!This was strength no lower than the Great-Transcendent Realm.\u201cAncient Sacred Mountains?\u201dThe expression of everyone from the Ancient Lin Family changed. If there was one force in the land of the Middle State that brought envy in their hearts, then that would definitely be the Ancient Sacred Mountains.The Ancient Sacred Mountains directly bordered the Upper Realm, and had a grand backing with many False Gods hidden in their ranks!\u201cI didn\u2019t think I will see the people of the Ancient Sacred Mountains in a place like this! I wonder what brings you to our Ancient Lin Family\u2019s door?\u201dThey were terrified at first, but recalling that their Ancestor was home, and there was also Young Lord Gu behind them, they couldn\u2019t help but feel at ease. On second thought, they guessed that this bunch from the Ancient Sacred Mountains had most-likely come for Young Lord Gu.\u201cTell that Young Lord from the Upper Realm to bring his ass out here! Our Lady wants to see him.\u201dThe youth with wings on his back sneered, and looked down on all the cultivators around him with disdain.The Patriarch of the Ancient Lin Family couldn\u2019t help but curse his courage in his heart.\u201cSince you want to see the Young Lord, please wait for a while, and I will go ask for the Young Lord\u2019s opinion\u2026\u201dHe frowned and replied. Although the other side was from the Ancient Sacred Mountains, he also had backing from the Upper Realm now! Could they see the Young Lord just because they said they wanted to?No! They had to ask for the Young Lord\u2019s permission first.What\u2019s more? Young Lord Gu had a distinguished status, so how could he personally come out to see their whatever lady? It would be no different from humiliating him.These visitors definitely didn\u2019t come with good intentions!\u201cAnd let us go to see him? Do you even know our Young Lady\u2019s identity? Just a word from her would be enough to raze your measly Lin Family to the ground\u2026\u201dThe young creature with the wings appeared displeased, and spoke with an attitude of extreme contempt and disdain. When the cultivators in the distance heard his words, their hearts shook in horror. They could decide the fate of the Ancient Lin Family with a word?He sure was bold and courageous!How come these ancient powers were more domineering than the last?Everyone was taken aback by his proclamation.Everyone in the Ancient Lin Family showed an ugly expression at his threat. These bastards from the Ancient Sacred Mountains were going too far!\u201cQuetian, shut up!\u201dYe Liuli\u2019s brows wrinkled. She had come to avenge her Brother Ye Chen, not to flaunt her background and bring pests after her, so she said in an extremely cold tone, \u201cPlease inform the Young Lord from the Upper Realm that Ye Chen\u2019s cousin desires an audience with His Excellency!\u201dThe expressions of everyone from the Ancient Lin Family, and the onlookers in the distance, showed a change when they heard her words. Over the last few days, Ye Chen\u2019s name had resounded in every corner of the Middle State, and there was no one who didn\u2019t know the God of Plague, and the Harbinger of Destruction.The Buddhist Holy Land was wiped from the face of the world because of this Ye Chen!Yet now, this girl with a terrifying background actually claimed to be Ye Chen\u2019s cousin? It seemed that they were enemies who had come knocking for revenge!Everyone felt their heads spin, and thought that the world was insane.The Patriarch of the Ancient Lin Family took in a deep breath, and spoke with a dignified expression, \u201cUnderstood. I will report it to the Young Lord right away!\u201dHaving said that, he turned around to head towards Gu Changge\u2019s palace to make the report. It seemed they would be in trouble today. Since the other party dared come knocking at their door with such ferociousness, then they must have some massive background behind them.[Crack! Kacha! Boom!]However, before the Patriarch of the Lin Family could take a step forward, a terrifying sound resembling the grinding of wheels sounded from the void.[Hum!]Brilliant runes flickered and turned into a terrifying golden palm, resembling a Heavenly Emperor who had descended to suppress the Heavens. With a speed so fast that no one could respond, the palm slapped out!The young creature with wings on his back showed an expression of deep horror, and shouted with despair masking his face, \u201cYOUNG LADY, SAVE\u2026\u201dBefore he could utter the word\u00a0\u2018me\u2019, his body exploded into a cloud of blood, and he was obliterated on the spot.At the same time, the calm voice of the Young Lord came from the depths of the Ancient Lin Family.\u201cLet them in.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s members were stunned and didn\u2019t know what to say. Everything happened so fast that no one outside had the time to react.The sudden obliteration of the winged youth from the Ancient Sacred Mountains scared all the cultivators that were watching the scene play out. His old servant was the palest and most terrified of them all. The slap just now was too fast for him to react, and even if he could react in time, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop it.He had sensed the might of a Conferred King from that palm. He was only half a step into the Conferred Lord Realm, so how could he contend against someone so high above him?\u201cYoung master\u2026\u201dHe showed a sad expression, but had no guts to retaliate, so he could only look at Ye Liuli for help.Ye Liuli, on the other hand, had also turned pale with fright. Just a second ago, the winged youth was harping arrogantly, yet in the next moment, he turned into a cloud of bloody mist!When had she ever experienced such a scene?She was barely eighteen, and had spent most of her life cultivating in seclusion inside the Ancient Sacred Mountains, so how could she even have the chance to witness such a scene?But soon, she took in a deep breath and recovered her frosty expression. After all, her frame of mind was far more resilient than others of her age. What\u2019s more? She had Aunt Xue backing her!\u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201dYe Liuli command, and immediately headed inside the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s estate. The creatures of the Ancient Sacred Mountains followed behind her. However, compared to the arrogance and disdain they showed at the beginning, their auras had subsided by a lot and they appeared a lot tamer and frightened.The other party was even more domineering and terrifying than their imagination.He directly exterminated one of them over a few words!This Young Lord from the Upper Realm might not be as simple as they had thought. The middle-aged woman hiding in the void couldn\u2019t help but frown, and an expression of contemplation appeared on her face.Just now, she had wanted to save that winged creature, but she couldn\u2019t leave her lady\u2019s side \u2014 she had felt a mighty aura lock down on her, and the strength of that person wasn\u2019t any weaker than her!It was definitely the Ancestor of the Ancient Lin Family, the rumored old slave of the Young Lord from the Upper Realm!This shocked her.One must know that at her peak, she was a mighty God King who could make waves even in the Upper Realm, and True Gods could only look up to her! Yet the cultivation of the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s ancestor was no less, or even more frightening, than a God King\u2019s from what she felt.She felt that things weren\u2019t going as well as planned, and matters weren\u2019t as simple as her Young Lady had initially imagined. After all, the other party had an\u00a0\u2018old slave\u2019\u00a0in the God King Realm!What\u2019s more? She had felt the unique aura of an Upper Realm\u2019s Immortal Dao Lineage from that crushing palm just now, and it clearly radiated the might of a Conferred King!She felt that it was quite familiar, but couldn\u2019t put her finger on where she had felt that aura before.\u2018A youth with such an aura is definitely a God-Child! Didn\u2019t they say his surname was Gu? There aren\u2019t many with the Gu surname in the Upper Realm! Could he be from that family?\u2019Aunt Xue suddenly recalled some matters, and felt that nothing was going in there favor. After all, Gu wasn\u2019t a common surname in the Upper Realm like Ye and Wang, and not many had the guts to use that name!The Family she recalled was no worse than the Immortal Heritage behind her Young Lady!\u2018If he\u2019s truly from that Family, then this might be an opportunity for us! A little Ye Chen isn\u2019t worth mentioning at all\u2026\u2019\u2018Although the Young Lady is the Patriarch\u2019s most-beloved daughter, she isn\u2019t the only one. This may be the Young Lady\u2019s greatest opportunity to rise above the others!\u2019Aunt Xue\u2019s eyes brightened with excitement as she thought about this matter. Her figure also emerged from the void, and she followed behind Ye Liuli to personally see everything play out.\u201cAunt Xue\u2026\u201dYe Liuli was surprised by Aunt Xue\u2019s sudden appearance; normally Aunt Xue would never show herself unless absolutely necessary!\u201cMy Lady, I think all of this might be a misunderstanding\u2026\u201dYe Liuli\u2019s expression stiffened as Aunt Xue\u2019s words fell into her ears.\u201cWhat happened? Why does this woman seem to be conveying goodness to me?\u201dOld Ming thought to himself with a puzzled expression in the void.Had this middle-aged woman dared to make a move just then, he would have surely smacked her down to the ground. However, this middle-aged beauty obviously noticed his presence, and even conveyed goodwill to him.This puzzled him a bit.Of course, as long as they didn\u2019t threaten his Young Lord\u2019s safety, he wouldn\u2019t bother attacking them either.\u2026\u2026\u201cEven the ferocious Ancient Sacred Mountains had to tuck their tail and walk in respectfully! That Young Lord is truly mighty \u2014 he directly slapped that guy to death!\u201d\u201cHis strength has most-definitely surpassed the Conferred Lord Realm, right? I had never even imagined to come across someone that might, especially, a young man with a strength so terrifying\u2026\u201d\u201cThis Young Lord from the Upper Realm is truly unfathomable\u2026\u201dThe shocked cultivators outside the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s estate discussed amongst themselves. This was the first time they saw the mysterious Young Lord take action, and it left a profound impression in their hearts.The Ancient Sacred Mountains were a place of awe and terror for the people of the Middle State where Gods and Devils dwelled! Many mighty powers and heritages had been obliterated just because they somehow offended the Ancient Sacred Mountains, so it was needless to say how mighty they were.Yet, today, they learned that there was someone even beyond the reach of the Ancient Sacred Mountains! In their hearts, the awe and reverence they held for Gu Changge multiplied exponentially!\u2026\u2026Inside his palace, Gu Changge sat at the host\u2019s seat, while Su Qingge stood beside him. Dressed in black, he playfully retracted his palm with a smirk on his face.Naturally, everything that happened outside the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s gate was in his eyes.Ye Chen\u2019s cousin?Someone from an Ancient Heritage, fostered in the Lower Realm, and had deep feelings for the Protagonist\u2026This was that bloody trope he was so familiar with!Of course, he had speculated about it a long time ago, but he never thought that it would truly come to pass!No dog author could deceive him!\u201cMy Lord, are you planning to kill them?\u201dSu Qingge put forth her doubt.\u201cNo, how could I, the most elegant and easy-going Young Lord kill people so easily? There\u2019s no value in indiscriminate slaughter.\u201d\u201cInstead, my heart is moved by their sudden arrival, and I can\u2019t wait to give them a warm welcome\u2026\u201dWith those words, Gu Changge stood up and walked towards the outside with his hands behind his back. Right then, he happened to come across Ye Liuli\u2019s group that was being led by the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s Patriarch towards his residence.Ye Liuli immediately realized that the young man in front of her was the Young Lord from the Upper Realm!Although she had never met him, his aloof temperament and demeanor were enough to give away his esteemed identity.\u2018This is exactly what a God-Child from the Upper Realm should look like\u2026\u2019Aunt Xue\u2019s eyes shone, and she couldn\u2019t help but praise in her heart.[VILFIC\u2019s Crib]Hi everyone,There was a minor mistake in Chapter 49 where I translated that Gu Changge reached the 8th Layer of his Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex. He almost reached the 8th Layer of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex, instead \u2014 he\u2019s 75% to the 8th Layer. I have fixed the mistake. Do pardon me as I missed the\u00a0almost\u00a0in the raw and messed it up somehow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With exquisite and gorgeous facial features, slender, long legs, and an extremely frosty aura, she looked to be a beauty no older than seventeen or eighteen years of age.Her eyes, though, were completely different from a normal human\u2019s. They appeared to be no different from colorful orbs of glass that made it clear to the onlookers that she was of a different race.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but tut-tut in his heart.This Ye Chen sure was blessed with game-breaking Fortune. What\u2019s more? When Gu Changge checked Ye Liuli\u2019s Fortune Value, he saw a value above 800!Her luck was even more amazing than Ye Chen\u2019s!Of course, it wasn\u2019t out of Gu Changge\u2019s expectations. This so-called cousin beauty was about to become Ye Chen\u2019s greatest backer, after all.As for how to deal with this cousin of Ye Chen? Gu Changge already had a plan in his mind.Weren\u2019t they childhood sweethearts? Good.She was merely a seventeen or eighteen years old girl, who he could easily toy with. After all, even an old monster like Yan Ji was played by him without a hint, so what could this little girl amount to?His expression showed indifference, and he didn\u2019t utter a single word. Gu Changge was in no hurry, anyways.While Gu Changge was looking at Ye Liuli, Ye Liuli, Aunt Xue, and the others were naturally busy looking at him, too.Aunt Xue\u2019s affirmed her belief the more she stared at Gu Changge, and realized that her previous guesses and thoughts weren\u2019t too far off.Gu Changge\u2019s appearance alone wasn\u2019t something to scoff at. He was dressed in a dark, long robe that accentuated his tall and handsome figure. His bearing was extremely noble and graceful, and there was an innate aloofness between his brows.She wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the one standing in front of her was truly a God-Child from that place.The so-called prodigies of the Lower Realm were like fireflies before the brilliant moon when compared to the true Supreme Prodigies of the Upper Realm. To be precise, they didn\u2019t even have the qualifications to be mentioned in the same breath as them!As for that Ye Chen? He was like an ant in front of this Heavenly Dragon who had descended from the Ninth Heaven.\u201cYou are that Young Lord Gu?\u201dFinally, Ye Liuli furrowed her brows and asked aloud. She naturally knew the answer to her question, but she didn\u2019t know how else to break the silence between them. At the same time, she felt a terrifying pressure from the presence of the young man standing before her.He simply stood there with a playful smile, and kept looking down at her as if he was watching an ant. It gave her an uncomfortable feeling.She didn\u2019t know how to start the conversation.When they had come inside, Aunt Xue had informed her about some matters:\u00a0\u2018first, the young man wasn\u2019t much older than her; second, Aunt Xue will not intervene unless her life was in danger; third, she wasn\u2019t his match even with her half-step Saint Realm cultivation base!\u2019She had arrived aggressively, but now, she felt that she was stupid. This brought extreme shame to her!Gu Changge heard her words and responded to her with another silent glance.Ye Liuli\u2019s expression fell as she saw his contemptuous eyes, and she couldn\u2019t help but gnash her pearly teeth. No matter whether it was in the Ancient Sacred Mountains, or the outside world, she had never met someone who showed so much contempt towards her. And definitely not when the other party was a man!Still, she was no ordinary prodigy, and quickly calmed her mind.At this moment, Aunt Xue, who was standing behind her, cupped her hands and said to the young man with a smile on her face, \u201cI pay my respect to Young Lord Gu! My Lady\u2019s name is Ye Liuli, and I am the one responsible for protecting My Lady in the Lower Realm\u2026\u201d\u201cMy Lady and this slave offended Young Lord unknowingly just now, so I hope Young Lord won\u2019t take it to heart. Please treat it as us not knowing proper etiquette!\u201dAunt Xue was sincere in her words, and not a shred of falsehood could be heard from her tone. Ye Liuli was a dozen or so millenniums too behind her when it came to life experience and how to deal with matters.\u201cAunt Xue\u2026\u201dYe Liuli was stunned, and showed a face full of disbelief as she saw Aunt Xue\u2019s attitude. The creatures of the Ancient Sacred Mountains behind her were also shocked!They knew well how mighty Aunt Xue was; she wouldn\u2019t even need to show up on normal days to deal with matters. Yet now, she actually showed such a respectful attitude before someone else?One had to know that they were here to seek revenge!\u201cAunt Xue, you are going too far!\u201dYe Liuli\u2019s expression darkened and she growled towards the middle-aged beauty. After all, since when did Aunt Xue, a mere retainer of her Ye Clan, had the authority to make decisions in the presence of her master?\u201cMy Lady, this matter is most certainly a misunderstanding! Why don\u2019t you take this opportunity to clarify the details of the events that transpired? It will be bad if we rushed to a conclusion without evidence\u2026\u201dAunt Xue hurriedly responded with a smile \u2014 she was doing it all for Ye Liuli\u2019s own good. After all, how could she harm the Young Lady she had watched grow up before her eyes?\u201cOh, is that so? Senior, you are truly polite \u2014 do let me know what I can do for you?\u201dGu Changge finally spoke after seeing the scene in front of him. His expression made it impossible for the onlookers to tell whether he was happy or enraged.This Ye Liuli\u2019s protector had piqued his interest, and this only made matters even better.\u201cBefore I begin, can I ask if Young Lord Gu is from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family?\u201dWith that said, a smile appeared on Aunt Xue\u2019s face and she cupped her hands to say, \u201cMy Young Lady is from the Ancient Immortal Ye Family! Speaking of that, our families are quite familiar with each other.\u201dAunt Xue immediately revealed Ye Liuli\u2019s origin to let Gu Changge know that they weren\u2019t simple either. Moreover, as the youngest and most beloved daughter of the Patriarch, her Lady had an incredible status that ordinary disciples of the Ye Family couldn\u2019t match up to.Of course, Gu Changge\u2019s status wasn\u2019t simple either from what she could tell, so she couldn\u2019t help but feel even more affection for him. No matter what, he was at least a Young Sovereign in the Upper Realm.Both of their sides were from Ancient Immortal Families in the Upper Realm. One was from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, while the other was from the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, both of which were hegemonies that lorded over endless territory!The only difference between them was that the Ancient Immortal Gu Family mostly had humans in their ranks, while the Ancient Immortal Ye Family comprised of a multitude of races and were commonly known as Family of Myriad Races.What\u2019s more? The two families were on familiar terms.She said all that because she wanted to confirm Gu Changge\u2019s identity!Hearing Aunt Xue\u2019s words, the creatures from the Ancient Sacred Mountains couldn\u2019t help but break out in cold sweat. Their expressions fell, and their faces turned pale. If Gu Changge really came from that background\u2026They couldn\u2019t help but tremble with beads of sweat oozing from their foreheads, and their limbs turned cold.Why didn\u2019t they say this before bringing them here? Why only mention it now?!They felt deep regret!They couldn\u2019t offend the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, nor could they offend the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. They were between a rock and a hard place right now\u2026Ye Liuli wanted to say something, but didn\u2019t know how to open her mouth.\u201cIt turned out you are from the Ancient Immortal Ye Family! No wonder Lady Ye Liuli was so fearless and directly came knocking at my door.\u201dGu Changge lightly spoke after hearing her words, and didn\u2019t deny her thoughts, \u201cMy father had a lot of dealings with the Ye Family\u2019s Patriarch back in the day. Senior should know that I will be the one taking charge of the Family in the future!\u201dHis words were uttered with a playful smirk. When it came to comparing background, there was no one who could contend with him. As for Aunt Xue? She naturally understood the hint in Gu Changge\u2019s words.Not only was he from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, but he was also the son of the Gu Family\u2019s Patriarch! After all, only people on the same level as the Ye Family\u2019s Patriarch could have dealings with him.People at that level were so mighty that a single stomp of their\u2019s could shake the Upper Realm and cause unimaginable changes that would affect the world\u2019s development for generations. They were monstrous beings who couldn\u2019t be described with words!Worse still? She had heard that the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s Patriarch only had one heir!As long as the young man in front of her didn\u2019t fall before his time, then he would undoubtedly be among the highest echelons of the Upper Realms in the future!He may even be the Patriarch of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family if everything went in his favor!As these thoughts crossed Aunt Xue\u2019s mind, the smile on her face deepened, and her expression turned even more humble and respectful. She felt flattered. Gu Changge calling her\u00a0\u2018Senior\u2019\u00a0was a great honor!At the same time, Ye Liuli felt her head buzz and her face turned pale. This matter had exceeded her wildest imagination![Bang!]The creatures from the Ancient Sacred Mountains felt their blood freeze, and all of them immediately fell to their knees out of sheer fright.\u201cYour Excellency\u2026 Quetian offended you just now, so we hope Your Excellency will show generosity and forgive us\u2026\u201dTheir voices trembled and they almost pissed their pants. Although they hadn\u2019t uttered any nonsense, what if they were swatted to death just for having a relationship with that loudmouth?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We had eyes, but couldn\u2019t see Mount Tai and offended you unknowingly\u2026\u201dThe previously-haughty creatures of the Ancient Sacred Mountains knelt on the ground with bloodless, pale expressions showing their extreme fright.It was as if they had come across their natural predator.Their haughtiness and domineering arrogance from a while ago had completely disappeared right now!The people of the Ancient Lin Family felt their hearts bloom in joy as they watched the scene in front of them. No matter how powerful the adversary\u2019s background, didn\u2019t they still have to kneel before their Young Lord Gu?\u201cWhy is this happening\u2026\u201dYe Liuli\u2019s face had also turned pale, and her jade-like hands tightly held her long sword. She wasn\u2019t stupid \u2014 on the contrary, she was smarter than her peers. The conversation between Aunt Xue and that Gu Changge was enough for her to understand one fact:\u00a0\u2018Gu Changge had a higher status than her!\u2019Although she was from the Upper Realm\u2019s Ancient Immortal Ye Family, she wasn\u2019t her father\u2019s only daughter even if he loved her the most. Gu Changge, on the other hand, was the sole heir of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s Patriarch.It was very likely that Gu Changge would be the one in-charge of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family in the future \u2014 she couldn\u2019t match his terrifying background with her current identity!Ye Liuli couldn\u2019t help but feel depressed when she realized this reality. Just why did her Brother Ye Chen provoke such a mighty figure?She had thought that she could easily deal with her Brother Ye Chen\u2019s enemy using her background and means, but now it seemed that all of those thoughts were nothing more than her childish delusions.Ye Liuli\u2019s face turned paler than before, and her haughtiness from before was completely gone by now.\u201cMy Lady, this is definitely a misunderstanding! You should apologize to Young Lord Gu, too!\u201dAunt Xue decided to persuade Ye Liuli, \u201cWhy would Young Lord Gu bother about the existence of a nobody like Ye Chen? Before him, Ye Chen is nothing more than an insignificant existence not worth minding.\u201dIn Aunt Xue\u2019s opinion, having a good relationship with this Young Lord Gu was far more important than anything else. She couldn\u2019t understand how her Lady could be so stupid to not even realize this fact?She felt deep regret and realized that she should have gone to find that Ye Chen and beat him to death a long time ago, behind her Lady\u2019s back. A fool like him, who had provoked Young Lord Gu so easily, would only commit worse crimes in the future!\u201cAunt Xue, you need not speak anymore! It\u2019s impossible for me to apologize to someone who made my Brother Ye Chen run from one place to another like a homeless orphan\u2026\u201dYe Liuli stubbornly responded. Her eyes showed deep unwillingness, and she refused to apologize to Gu Changge no matter what happened.The conversation between the two naturally fell in Gu Changge\u2019s eyes. His face still showed a calm and indifferent expression, but in his heart, he couldn\u2019t stop laughing.After all, Ye Liuli was nothing but a little girl, so what winds and waves could she make before him?As for Ye Liuli\u2019s identity as the little princess of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family? Gu Changge felt that he could use her.Wasn\u2019t she Ye Chen\u2019s childhood sweetheart who was greatly fond of him? Ye Chen happened to be her weakness.Speaking of which, the Ancient Immortal Ye Family\u2019s influence in the Upper Realm wasn\u2019t small. As a Family that was the closest to True Immortals among all the Ancient Family\u2019s, they were said to be descendants of Immortals themselves.Gu Changge\u2019s lips curled into a smirk as he thought up a detailed plan in his heart. After all, he was the inheritor of a forbidden technique who was born with a Devil Heart, so there was no way he would lack evil methods and crooked means.Controlling a mere Ye Liuli wouldn\u2019t be all that hard for him.At this moment, he showed a bit of impatience in his expression, and spoke with an annoyed tone, \u201cSo, what\u2019s your purpose in visiting me today? If you don\u2019t give this Gu an explanation, even if you are from the Ancient Immortal Ye Family\u2026\u201d\u201cOld Ming!\u201dWithout speaking too much, Gu Changge commanded towards the void.\u201cMy Lord, this old slave is at your command!\u201d[Swoosh!]As soon as Gu Changge\u2019s words fell, Old Ming appeared from the void with a cold smile adorning his face. He released a terrifying force of oppression that immediately suppressed the surroundings and made everyone pale on their spots.Ye Liuli was suffocated!This was the old servant she thought couldn\u2019t rival her Aunt Xue? He was too powerful!\u201cYoung Lord Gu, please calm down! It\u2019s indeed My Lady\u2019s fault, and she shouldn\u2019t have offended you like this\u2026\u201dAunt Xue\u2019s expression changed and she hurriedly blocked Old Ming\u2019s oppressive aura. The old man in front of her was extremely mighty!The two of them could only exert the might of a False God Realm cultivator in the Lower Realm, but the other party\u2019s False God Realm cultivation was mightier than her own. If they fought, then she might be able to handle a few exchanges at the start, but it won\u2019t be long before he would completely suppress her!She was sure that she could escape with her Young Lady, but that would be contrary to her intentions, and she would only offend Gu Changge further.Gu Changge, however, didn\u2019t give a damn about Aunt Xue\u2019s thoughts, nor did he look at her anymore. His expression turned indifferent, and he overlooked everyone!\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you were here for a chat? This Gu sees that there are a lot of people who came over\u2026\u201d\u201cOld Ming, kill one of them for this Lord!\u201dGu Changge commanded.As soon as they heard his words, the creatures of the Ancient Sacred Mountains behind Ye Liuli turned pale with extreme fright. Despair masked their faces, and they knelt on the ground and begged for mercy in loud voices.\u201cYoung Lady, help us! We don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\u201cYoung Lord, please spare our life!\u201d\u201cGu Changge, you are so despicable and shameless\u2026\u201dYe Liuli\u2019s face paled and her body trembled as she heard his words and their shouts. She never thought Gu Changge would use such a despicable method to bring her to her knees.Unfortunately, Gu Changge didn\u2019t even look at her.Su Qingge, on the other hand, intimately handed him a cup of tea and said with a sweet smile, \u201cMy Lord, your tea is ready.\u201dGu Changge gave her a nod of approval \u2014 he hadn\u2019t spoiled her in vain!\u201cMy Lady, please apologize to Young Lord Gu! Why can\u2019t you understand? If Young Lord Gu desired to kill Ye Chen, would he be able to escape with his life?\u201d\u201cHow could Ye Chen ever have the ability to escape from someone as mighty as Young Lord Gu?\u201d\u201cAll of this is most-likely a misunderstanding!\u201d\u201cYou are the Princess of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, while Young Lord Gu is the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, so he won\u2019t make things difficult for you as long as you apologize to him\u2026\u201dAunt Xue sighed in her heart, and kept persuading Ye Liuli. She was doing it while keeping her Young Lady\u2019s best interests in her mind.How could a mere Ye Chen deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as Young Lord Gu?\u201cSomeone like him can\u2019t be a good person\u2026\u201dYe Liuli showed an enraged and defiant expression, and glared at Gu Changge. Her eyes spewed fire, and she desired to burn Gu Changge into ash.\u201cDo it.\u201dGu Changge slowly took a sip of the tea in his hand, and spoke.\u201cUnderstood, My Lord!\u201dOld Ming received the order, and slapped out. Brilliant runes flickered, and the void around them trembled.[Puff!]A pale-faced, scary-looking creature from the Ancient Sacred Mountains was slapped to death with a face full of despair. His sudden death shocked the rest!\u201cYoung Lady, have mercy! We don\u2019t want to die!\u201d\u201cYoung Lady, we came here with you, so you can\u2019t do this to us\u2026\u201dThey couldn\u2019t help but resent Ye Liuli. It was clear that she could save them all as long as she showed a better attitude and apologized! Yet, why wasn\u2019t she doing it?Were their lives not even worth a few words from her?Gu Changge indifferently watched all of this. From the beginning to the end, his face showed no change in his expression.Ye Liuli couldn\u2019t help but ground her teeth as she saw his indifferent expression. Her body trembled, and extreme rage bubbled in her heart. She was forced against a wall, and couldn\u2019t help but regret her actions now.What could she do now? Ask Aunt Xue to make a move?It was clear from Aunt Xue\u2019s actions that she was on Gu Changge\u2019s side, and won\u2019t listen to her command at this time.Ye Liuli felt extremely humiliated as she thought of this, and spoke through gritted teeth, \u201cEverything that happened today was\u2026Liuli\u2019s fault\u2026I apologize! I hope Young Lord Gu can forgive Liuli\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her voice trembled, showing just how much courage and determination she put into uttering those words from her mouth. She felt exhaustion overtake her as soon as she finished her words.As the little princess of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, she was hailed as a bright moon shining among the stars from the moment of her birth. Never had she suffered endless humiliation like today!Alas! She couldn\u2019t deal with the man before her, and even the background behind her couldn\u2019t suppress him!\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize for anything! This Lord isn\u2019t an unreasonable man \u2014 there\u2019s no way I will make matters difficult for you over such a trivial matter.\u201dGu Changge responded with a wave of his hand, and commanded Old Ming to stop with a playful smirk on his face.Although he uttered words of righteousness with a straight face, Ye Liuli knew that everyone other than her would have been swatted to death if she hadn\u2019t apologized to him!This man was extremely dangerous!Be it his means or his incalculable thoughts, everything about him gave her a feeling of fright. She regretted pitting herself against him. Why was she so reckless? Why didn\u2019t she investigate the matter before coming to his door to seek justice?She picked a rock, only to smash it on her own foot!\u201cSee, My Lady, I told you it was a misunderstanding and Young Lord Gu won\u2019t embarrass you if you acknowledge your mistake.\u201dAunt Xue also heaved a sigh of relief once the matter ended. Ye Liuli, on the other hand, glared daggers at her.Retainer was a good word, but in reality, Aunt Xue was nothing more than a servant! Yet today, this servant had overreached and made decisions in her stead without any authorization from her master!Ye Liuli swore to report her actions to her father as soon as she returned to the Upper Realm!Aunt Xue couldn\u2019t help but show a wry smile at her Lady\u2019s furious glare. She wasn\u2019t worried though. If the Patriarch heard about what happened today, he would certainly understand her and even agree with her actions.After all, this Young Lord Gu was someone who was worthy to be a friend of their Ancient Immortal Ye Family. A mere apology was nothing. It\u2019s just that her Young Lady was still naive, and wasn\u2019t willing to accept defeat\u2026Everything Aunt Xue did was for the Family and her Lady!As Old Ming withdrew, the terrifying aura pressing down on everyone in the surroundings also disappeared.\u201cThank you! Thank you for your mercy, Young Lord!\u201d\u201cThank you for your mercy, Young Lord!\u201dThe creatures of the Ancient Sacred Mountains kept kneeling, and proclaimed their gratitude for Gu Changge\u2019s mercy.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me \u2014 it was Lady Ye Liuli who saved your lives, so you should thank her.\u201dGu Changge responded.Between him and Ye Liuli, the one the creatures of the Ancient Sacred Mountains resented more was definitely Ye Liuli right now\u2026Gu Changge knew this well, so he naturally wouldn\u2019t give up on this chance to provoke discord between them.After all, he wouldn\u2019t lose anything from a few words.\u201cDare I ask Young Lord Gu\u2019s name?\u201dBy now, Ye Liuli had also recovered from her feelings of humiliation, and scared at Gu Changge\u2019s face with a disgusting look in her eyes.Wicked men truly had thick skins, she thought!\u201cGu Changge.\u201dBy now, Gu Changge\u2019s expression of indifference had long disappeared. With a faint smile adoring his face, he handed the teacup in his hands to Su Qingge, who was standing beside him.His calm and gentle expression gave people a sense of elegance and nobility.Of course, that would have been the case with everyone, had they not seen his true face just now\u2026Ye Liuli never thought Gu Changge would be so quick to change his face, and this was exactly what increased the unease in her heart. After all, the most fearful people were those who showed no emotion whether they were enraged or joyful.You could never tell what went through the minds of such people \u2014 they were truly unpredictable!\u201cYoung Lord Gu, the reason I came here today was to enquire about a certain matter; no, to be precise, I came here to seek justice!\u201dYe Liuli took in a deep breath to calm herself. No matter what, she had to seek justice from this villainous Gu Changge today!\u201cOh?\u201d Gu Changge raised his eyebrows, and said with a mysterious smile, \u201cWhat justice do you want to seek? This Gu doesn\u2019t remember offending Lady Ye\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about my Brother Ye Chen!\u201dYe Liuli directly got to the point. She couldn\u2019t stand Gu Changge\u2019s contemptuous and pretentious attitude of not knowing anything.Gu Changge, on the other hand, loved the feeling of bringing others to their knees. Seeing others give in to him even though they hated him, and couldn\u2019t wait to bite his neck off, gave him a feeling of exhilaration.Even if Ye Liuli was the little princess of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t give her any face. Of course, he wanted to have her kneel and beg, but he knew that would have the opposite affect. What\u2019s more? That beautiful middle-aged guardian behind her wouldn\u2019t let that happen.Pushing Ye Liuli, the princess of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, to her knees would be tantamount to slapping the Ancient Immortal Ye Family in the face.Gu Changge wasn\u2019t dumb enough to shoot himself in the foot. If he did that, he would only worsen his situation when it came time for him to return to the Upper Realm.Everything had to be done in moderation.As for killing Ye Liuli and the rest? Whether it was possible or not, Gu Changge would never do something that will bring him more losses than gains.There was no way the daughter of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family\u2019s Patriarch wouldn\u2019t have some life-saving treasures or means on her person. He would need other means to deal with Ye Liuli.\u201cYou want justice for Ye Chen? I don\u2019t remember doing anything to him though\u2026could Lady Ye be mistaken about something?\u201d\u201cWhy would I let him go if I really wanted to do something to him? Squeezing an ant like him to death isn\u2019t all that hard for me, after all.\u201dGu Changge said with a light smile.Ye Liuli felt her breath halt as she heard his words. She felt as if he was looking down on her and everything else around her!Unfortunately, it was nothing but a fact that her Brother Ye Chen was nothing more than an ant before someone of Gu Changge\u2019s status and identity right now. She couldn\u2019t help but feel confused.How did the enmity between the two even come about?Logically speaking, her Brother Ye Chen didn\u2019t know her true identity, so how did he survive after offending Gu Changge? Could it be that Gu Changge truly never tried to kill her Brother Ye Chen?What was her Brother Ye Chen up to? What had he gone through while she was away?Gu Changge vaguely guessed Ye Liuli\u2019s thoughts through her displeased and confused expression. He couldn\u2019t help but cackle in his heart.Why hadn\u2019t he killed Ye Chen?Obviously, because he was waiting for that leek to fatten up, so he could get as much meat from him as possible when he finally sent him to the slaughterhouse!How could Ye Liuli comprehend his reasoning?\u201cImpossible! Brother Ye Chen is an honest and upright person who will never do anything to provoke others!\u201dYe Liuli shook her head in disbelief. At the same time, her gaze fell upon Su Qingge, who stood beside Gu Changge.According to the rumors, her Brother Ye Chen was a toad who wanted to eat swan meat, and coveted the beauty of the Eastern Wilderness\u2019 number one fairy! Dressed in clothes as white as snow, Su Qingge indeed looked like a fairy who had descended upon the mortal world.Ye Liuli held great confidence in her appearance, but when she compared herself to the woman in front of her, she realized that she wasn\u2019t as good as her!She held an amazing, mature charm that she couldn\u2019t make up for right now.Such a woman could indeed move her Brother Ye Chen\u2019s heart, so the rumors might not be completely false\u2026\u201cSince Young Lord Gu didn\u2019t intend to kill Brother Ye Chen, they why did you destroy the Buddhist Holy Land that was related to Brother Ye Chen?\u201dYe Liuli suddenly raised her head and glared at Gu Changge through her reddened, glazed eyes. She was unwilling to accept reality, and couldn\u2019t stop herself from questioning him.After all, the rumors said that the Buddhist Holy Land\u2019s Holy Son had refused to reveal her Brother Ye Chen\u2019s whereabouts, and that was why Gu Changge commanded his servant to obliterate them in rage.She couldn\u2019t make sense of these matters anymore.\u201cRidiculous!\u201dRight then, Gu Changge\u2019s expression froze over, and he said with an indifferent tone, \u201cCould it be that Lady Ye came here to interrogate me? So what if I trample an ant to death? Since when do I need to explain my actions before you?\u201dGu Changge\u2019s words suffocated Ye Liuli, and her face paled. She couldn\u2019t help but tightly clench her long sword. Her head buzzed, and she didn\u2019t know how to respond to him.He was correct!Destroying the Buddhist Holy Land was no different from trampling an ant, so why would he need a reason for that?\u201cLady Ye, is there anything else you would like to ask? If not, then please return to where you came from.\u201dGu Changge said with an annoyed tone showing his desire for the\u00a0\u2018guests\u2019\u00a0to take their leave. He should have already planted a thorn in Ye Liuli\u2019s heart. As for whether it will do anything, that would depend on his actions in the future.Of course, he had other ways to deal with her even if the thorn he planted did nothing.Everything was under his control!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But she realized that she had indeed gone too far \u2014 after all, since when did Gu Changge need to explain his actions before her?His claim that he didn\u2019t try to kill her Brother Ye Chen also didn\u2019t hold any falsehood. Ye Liuli couldn\u2019t find any words of retort to his statements. The gap between Gu Changge and Ye Chen was simply too great, so much so that one of them was in Heaven while the other was on the Earth.Ye Chen would have long perished if Gu Changge wished for him to die. Ye Liuli couldn\u2019t help but feel apologetic towards Gu Changge after this realization hit her.She wasn\u2019t an ignorant woman who couldn\u2019t listen to reason.Today, she had come knocking at their door asking Gu Changge for an explanation out of nowhere. Now that she thought about her actions, she realized that she had been somewhat unreasonable.Gu Changge wasn\u2019t going too far by looking down on her and asking her to apologize; the fault lied with her!\u201cLiuli has offended you today, Young Lord Gu! Thank you for clarifying this matter for Liuli.\u201dYe Liuli regained her composure and said to Gu Changge.\u201cSince you have received what you wanted, you may leave now!\u201dGu Changge wasn\u2019t surprised by her words, but he couldn\u2019t care less. His indifference made Ye Liuli frown, and she felt a little down.She had never suffered such humiliation, especially, she had never been chased out by someone. Today, she had hit an iron plate multiple times because of this man in front of her.She felt unwilling and unconvinced!Of course, Ye Liuli\u2019s pride didn\u2019t allow her to bicker with him anymore. Without saying another word, she turned around and prepared to leave.\u201cYoung Lord Gu, I think you young \u2018uns should get along with each other. After all, all of us are from the Upper Realm, and it\u2019s fate that has brought us all together here in the Lower Realm\u2026\u201dAunt Xue couldn\u2019t help but speak with flattery after seeing the exchange between the two. She believed from the bottom of her heart that their meeting with Gu Changge was an unprecedented opportunity, and that they shouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201cNo need, I am not interested in her!\u201dGu Changge direct refusal pushed Aunt Xue\u2019s words down her throat, and her expression stiffened. He didn\u2019t know what was going through this middle-aged beauty\u2019s mind, but he couldn\u2019t care less about her.He didn\u2019t need to give face to Ye Liuli or anyone related to her, nor did he need to brush up on her favorability towards him.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAn expression of embarrassment appeared on Aunt Xue\u2019s face, and she didn\u2019t know what else to say. She understood that her Young Lady\u2019s performance today was somewhat inappropriate, even shameful, but to say those words so bluntly\u2026he wasn\u2019t giving any face to her Lady.Ye Liuli, who had turned around, trembled and stopped in her tracks. What did he mean by saying he wasn\u2019t interested in her? She felt that Aunt Xue had made her lose all face today.Ye Liuli\u2019s feelings of humiliation deepened, and she gnashed her pearly teeth.\u201cMy Lady, forgive me\u2026\u201dAunt Xue felt guilt claw at her heart. She understood that her Lady had lost much face due to her actions today.Ye Liuli ignored her, and with her frosty expression chilling further, she left without saying a word or looking back. She was worried that she might do something untoward if she stayed there any longer.From her birth to this day, she had never suffered humiliation as extreme as what Gu Changge gave her. Her feelings of apology towards Gu Changge immediately disappeared into thin smoke.He was an absolute villain!Staying in his presence would only bring her more disgrace.\u2026\u2026[Ding! You have shaken Ye Liuli\u2019s trust in Ye Chen! Ye Chen lost 100 Points of Fortune Value! You received 500 Destiny Points!]A System Prompt rang in Gu Changge\u2019s mind as soon as Ye Liuli and her group left. A playful smile appeared on his face as everything had gone according to his plans.Ye Liuli might be an impulsive brat, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. A few nudges from him were enough to lead her down a spiral of her own thoughts.True, Ye Liuli would hate him to his bones, but Gu Changge couldn\u2019t care less about that. Sooner or later, he will deal with her, too!Just a few sentences from him were enough to give her some food for thought. Right now, she wondered if Ye Chen had truly done something evil? After all, the Ye Chen in her impression was a honest, kind, and persevering young man.A large amount of Ye Chen\u2019s luck came from this cousin with a mighty background. Over the last period of time, Ye Chen must have obtained a lot of opportunities, and his Fortune Value should have skyrocketed.Gu Changge was waiting for the right moment to harvest that leek.\u2018Attribute Panel.\u2019Then, Gu Changge called out in his heart.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Host: Gu ChanggeHalo: Destined Heavenly VillainIdentity: True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao PalaceBloodline: Devil Heart, Dao BoneCultivation: Conferred Lord (Late Stage)Mystical Abilities:Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex (7th Layer [75%])Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple (Talent)Myriad Changes Demonic Physique (Talent)Immortal-Devouring Demon Art\u2026Destiny Points: 2000Fortune Value: 480 (Dark)System Shop: OpenWarehouse:Domain-Traversing Talisman x1One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x2Fortune Plundering Card x3System\u2019s Reward Calculations Multiplication Card x1\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014After consuming the 3000 Destiny Points required to reach the Late Stage of the Conferred Lord Realm, he was left with 1500 Destiny Points. Those had risen to 2000 after this haul.Over the last couple of days, his Fortune Value had also increased slowly. He had received 30 Points without putting in any effort, or plundering someone else\u2019s Fortune.Gu Changge knew that this rise in his Fortune Value was because of the overpowered Fortune Su Qingge and Lin Qiuhan were blessed with. Lin Qiuhan\u2019s terrifying talent for Alchemy finally flourished during this period of time, and that gave another boost to her Fortune Value.At the same time, Gu Changge\u2019s Fortune Value also rose because of her.Then, Gu Changge started to ponder about Ye Chen\u2019s affairs.Now that Ye Liuli had come out of her seclusion and stepped into the world, it shouldn\u2019t be long before the plot unites her with Ye Chen. It\u2019s just that Ye Liuli didn\u2019t know where Ye Chen was hiding right now.However, Ye Chen, himself, should look for her as soon as news regarding her actions spread around. Unless Ye Chen had a hole in his brain, there\u2019s no way he would want to let go of a thigh as fat as Ye Liuli\u2019s.He will take the initiative to show himself!\u2018I can clearly sense Ye Chen\u2019s exact location from the mark I left behind on his Master\u2026\u2019\u2018He isn\u2019t far from the Central Heavenly City, and should be at the point where the eight regions intersect.\u2019A strange light flicked in Gu Changge\u2019s eyes as he squinted in thought.\u2018If my guess is correct, the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm should open any time now. It\u2019s the reason my Original descended to the Lower Realm, so there\u2019s no way I will let go of the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]!\u2019Gu Changge went through the memories in his mind. The Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm was created by a Quasi-Supreme powerhouse to seal the monstrous weapon, the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd].The [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] had a deep connection to the secret technique Gu Changge cultivated, so there was no way he would let go of it.As for how terrifying and fierce the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] was? There wasn\u2019t even a need to think about it. A Quasi-Supreme had to self-immolate in order to seal it and prevent it from causing chaos in the world.According to the normal cliche and tropes, Ye Chen would be the one receiving the inheritance of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm. During this process, he would suppress the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] and bring it under his control right when it escapes from its release and is about to bring a disaster to the Middle State.Just like that, Ye Chen would become a hero who brings home a beauty and the treasures.There was no need to talk about the dangers of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm created by a Quasi-Supreme.In the Upper Realm, those with the title of Quasi-Supreme could easily be the Ancestors of supreme Dao Heritages that could exist for millions of years or even longerIf he didn\u2019t tread carefully inside the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm, the chance of him dying there wouldn\u2019t be small.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYan Ji\u2019s Thoughts; Rift Between Master and Disciple!\u2018The creatures of the Ancient Sacred Mountains arrived at the gate of the Ancient Lin Family with great fanfare, but their loudest man with wings on his back was immediately slapped to death.\u2019\u00a0\u2014 this news soon spread throughout the Middle State.The matter became a hot topic of discussion among the cultivators, and everyone could be heard talking about it, be it after dinner or before teatime.Although people didn\u2019t know the specific details of the events that transpired, they did hear that the creatures of the Ancient Sacred Mountains were forced to leave in despair. All the cultivators of the world learned after this that even a mighty existence like the Ancient Sacred Mountains couldn\u2019t stand before the mysterious Young Lord from the Upper Realm!The mysterious Young Lord Gu was unfathomable!Other than that, the girl in purple who called herself Ye Chen\u2019s cousin also attracted the attention of many. Some said that her origin wasn\u2019t minor either, and she came from a background even mightier than the Ancient Sacred Mountains.It\u2019s just that not many believed those rumors.The cultivators, who had witnessed everything from outside the Ancient Lin Family, had seen the girl in purple leave with an ugly expression on her frosty face. It was clear that she had hit an iron plate inside the Ancient Lin Family.Many then speculated that the girl in purple might be from the Upper Realm as well, and this statement was accepted by the majority.All kinds of rumors spread through the Middle State, causing a stir.\u2026\u2026Three days passed in the blink of an eye, and the Dao Conference was held in the Moon-facing Ancient City as scheduled.Many Holy Lands, big shots, and descendants of Ancient Dynasties came to participate, and that made the Moon-facing Ancient City extremely lively.Everyone had the same goal in mind:\u00a0\u2018meet the mysterious Young Lord during this Dao Conference!\u2019Too bad, they were disappointed.Although there were people from the Ancient Lin Family who came to participate, no one got to see any signs of the Young Lord\u2019s presence. He wasn\u2019t even present at the platform where all the big shots gathered together to watch the Dao Conference.This brought great disappointment to a lot of cultivators who had especially arrived to gaze upon the Heavenly visage of the Young Lord from the Upper Realm. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t have the fortune.As for visiting the Ancient Lin Family?They weren\u2019t qualified.Naturally, Gu Changge had no interest in such a low-leveled Dao Conference. Right now, he was heading towards the intersection of the Middle State\u2019s eight regions near the border of the Central Heavenly City, together with Old Ming.Since Ye Chen was around that area, then it meant that the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm was also there. The Secret Realm should be opening any day now, according to his calculations.\u2026\u2026In a remote town near the border of the Central Heavenly City.With sky-high mountains, towering ancient trees, and extremely vast plains, it was a place not visited much by cultivators on normal days due to its remote location.But today, innumerable cultivators and creatures of other races flew around in the sky leaving behind brilliant lights like rainbows. Some rode atop beasts, others stood atop magic weapons, and many wandered on foot all over the place.\u201cA brilliant divine light broke out from this place a while ago, and Heavenly phenomenon were seen from as far as three thousand miles away! This attracted the attention of the many forces and cultivators nearby, and they say a divine treasure is about to be born here\u2026\u201d\u201cNo wonder there are so many cultivators coming here! This was the reason.\u201dA youth with ordinary features walked through the streets and listened to the chatter of the townsfolk. His face showed a resolute expression, and he couldn\u2019t help but mutter to himself, \u201cIt seems that someone has already discovered the entrance of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm recorded in the fragment!\u201d\u201cI have already collected all the fragments of the Secret Realm\u2019s map, so I can walk around freely no matter how many deathtraps there are inside it. Other than that, I also have the key left behind by the Senior who created this Heavenly Secret Realm.\u201d\u201cOnce the entrance opens, I will blend in with all the cultivators rushing inside and head towards the core of the Secret Realm\u2026\u201dThe youth appeared to be speaking to himself, but, in fact, he was communicating with his Master who lived in the ring on his finger.This youth was none other than Ye Chen!During this period, he had improved his cultivation and even obtained massive opportunities while searching for the map\u2019s fragments. He was already at the peak of the Transcendent Realm right now!In just a few months, he had risen from the Spirit Palace Realm to the peak of the Transcendent Realm, and even faintly touched the threshold of the Great-Transcendent Realm. If ordinary cultivators heard about his insane cultivation speed, their eyes would pop out of their eye sockets, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to stop themselves from exclaiming in shock.Even the word\u00a0\u2018monstrous\u2019\u00a0wasn\u2019t enough to describe such freakish talent.Of course, it wouldn\u2019t surprise Gu Changge. After all, this was expected from the Favored Children of Heaven.Ye Chen, however, was not satisfied even with such tremendous improvement. He felt that his cultivation still speed wasn\u2019t fast enough. Although he had chanced upon many opportunities, he still couldn\u2019t close the chasm between him and Gu Changge.\u201cOnly when I get the inheritance of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm will I be able to kill that Gu Changge and take my revenge\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd that b!tc4, Su Qingge\u2026\u201dFlames of hatred flared in Ye Chen\u2019s eyes as he recalled the past. After pondering over the matter for a while, he had come to the realization that Gu Changge\u2019s strength was indeed not something he could deal with.Previously, no matter how mighty his enemies, or how great the background behind them, he had always come out on top by turning danger into an opportunity and receiving a massive power-up. This made Ye Chen believe that the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm was the opportunity prepared for him to turn over his current situation.Inside the ring, Yan Ji floated in the void with a bored expression. She didn\u2019t reply to Ye Chen even after hearing his words.With her glazed, scarlet pupils, she stared into the void with a dazed expression. Right now, her appearance didn\u2019t resemble the mighty Master Ye Chen was so familiar with.She had watched Ye Chen improve sharply over the last period of time with her own eyes. His speed of improvement was even more ferocious then some of the geniuses of the Upper Realm.All of this gave her a strange feeling, and she didn\u2019t know what to do.Before, she had thought that Ye Chen would never be able to take revenge on Gu Changge in this life. Even if he received the inheritance of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm, that fact wouldn\u2019t change.Back in her heydey, she might not have been a Quasi-Supreme, but she wasn\u2019t too far behind from that level. In her opinion, Gu Changge, a youth who could take out something as precious as the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill], couldn\u2019t be from a simple background. His Family or Sect wouldn\u2019t be lacking existences at the Quasi-Supreme or Supreme level.Because of this, Yan Ji had given up on persuading Ye Chen, and resented him somewhat now.No matter how one compared him with Gu Changge, Ye Chen couldn\u2019t hold a candle before him. Their backgrounds were too far apart, and so was their cultivation base. Ye Chen would never be able to succeed in his revenge.But now\u2026Yan Ji\u2019s thoughts had changed. With the speed at which Ye Chen\u2019s cultivation rose, he might really be able to create a miracle.Yan Ji couldn\u2019t help but feel some worry for Gu Changge.Maybe, she was grateful to him for the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill]\u2026or maybe, his sincere attitude back in the dungeon moved her. At that time, he could have easily killed Ye Chen, or even taken the ring away from him with force, but he did neither.Yan Ji had a good impression of Gu Changge, and believed that he would make massive waves in the future. Because of this, Yan Ji was in a complicated mood and didn\u2019t know whose side to take.Her remnant spirit had fallen into the Lower Realm and survived in a ring. Later, Ye Chen got the ring and it was because of his hard-cultivated Spiritual Qi that she could awaken from her slumber. If not for him, she wouldn\u2019t know how long it would take for her to wake up.It was precisely because of her that Ye Chen went from a well-known genius to a despised trash whose cultivation regressed instead of rising. His fiancee broke the engagement between them, and he ended up as an object of ridicule for everyone.She felt extreme guilt towards him, and that\u2019s why she took him as her disciple and taught him as much as she could. She was determined to help this persevering youth rise to the top again.Unfortunately, Ye Chen\u2019s recent performance brought her great disappointment. He couldn\u2019t tell between good and bad, and flames of jealousy and envy clouded his judgement.It had come to the point where he even suspected her, and thought that she was in cahoots with Gu Changge!If that was the case, then why would she bother staying by his side and keep on guiding him in his cultivation? After all, Gu Changge was far superior to him in every aspect, so shouldn\u2019t she immediately go over to his side?She had held true to her conscience, and was unmoved by Gu Changge\u2019s sincerity in the face of her desire to repay the grace she had received from Ye Chen.Alas! Ye Chen couldn\u2019t comprehend such a simple matter, and thought that she was staying with him right now out of pity.This broke Yan Ji\u2019s heart and left her helpless.She knew a rift had appeared between her and Ye Chen, and the problem, contrary to Ye Chen\u2019s belief, lied with Ye Chen himself.She wasn\u2019t the one at fault here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With the Secret Realm\u2019s map in his hands, he wasn\u2019t worried about not getting the goods.Of course, he knew that a rift had formed between him and Yan Ji over the last few days \u2014 he could feel the change in the way she treated him.After carefully thinking about the events, he realized that he had indeed gone overboard with his words and hurt his Master\u2019s heart. Even though his Master said she didn\u2019t care about the past, he had still apologized to her again and again, and did his best to make amends.Alas! The rift between them couldn\u2019t be closed.Ye Chen also understood that he could no longer put all of his trust in anyone around him, especially after he experienced Su Qingge\u2019s betrayal. Although his Master treated him with great care, she was also a woman. Who could guarantee she wouldn\u2019t be tempted by a man like Gu Changge?It was possible that his Master didn\u2019t want to tell him the truth, and was staying with him out of pity.Gloominess filled Ye Chen\u2019s eyes as those thoughts crossed his mind, and he tightly clenched his fists. His Master belonged to him and him alone \u2014 he would never let Gu Changge take her away!\u201cMaster, why do you think that Gu Changge descended to the Lower Realm? Since he came down with a servant who can easily destroy a power like the Buddhist Holy Land, I think he came for the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm, too!\u201dOut of nowhere, Ye Chen asked Yan Ji with a strange smile on his face. He wanted to see Yan Ji\u2019s reaction at his words.Hearing his words, Yan Ji was momentarily stunned, but then immediately said with a nod, \u201cI think your guess isn\u2019t too far off. Except for the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm, there\u2019s nothing else worthy of his attention in this Lower Realm,\u201dYan Ji responded to him without thinking too much about his question. She treated it as nothing more than a random question from Ye Chen, as Ye Chen had a habit of asking her about anything and everything.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Gu Changge must covet something in the Secret Realm. When he receives the news about the Secret Realm, he will most likely come here for whatever he wants to obtain. Unfortunately for him, only I have the map of this Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm, and anyone else who enters will encounter many dangers. There\u2019s even a chance for them to lose their life\u2026\u201d\u201cConsidering the Secret Realm\u2019s restriction, there\u2019s no way his old servant will be able to step inside. This means that Gu Changge will have to enter the Secret Realm all by himself, without anyone to protect or guide him\u2026I will rush to the Secret Realm\u2019s core region ahead of him, and when he arrives there, I will use the Secret Realm\u2019s key to control the formations in there\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster, do you think I can have my revenge like this?\u201dYe Chen formulated his every step, and asked in a faint voice.All of it made sense.Naturally, he said it out loud to see his Master\u2019s reaction. After all, his plan sounded flawless, and he should be able to slaughter Gu Changge and bury him in the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm.\u201cYour plan is reasonable, but what makes you think Gu Changge doesn\u2019t have a map or some other means to travel through the Secret Realm?\u201dYan Ji didn\u2019t know Ye Chen\u2019s true intentions. After hearing his plan, she thought about it for a long time, and felt that it wasn\u2019t all that feasible.After all, Gu Changge was someone from the Upper Realm, so there was no way he would come down unprepared. How could he not understand the dangers of the Secret Realm?And, from what she glimpsed of Gu Changge\u2019s mind, he wasn\u2019t a reckless person.\u201cIs that so? Master, your words indeed make sense\u2026\u201dAlthough he said that, a flash of gloom passed through Ye Chen\u2019s eyes.What other means could Gu Changge have? What did his Master mean by those words? Why was his Master so confident in Gu Changge, but felt that his means weren\u2019t enough?Was there something she didn\u2019t want him to know?He no longer spoke.Yan Ji didn\u2019t think too much about their exchange, and mentioned another matter, \u201cLittle Chen, there\u2019s one thing you must pay attention to:\u00a0\u2018the force behind your cousin is extremely terrifying, so I suggest that you don\u2019t meet her before your strength reaches the False God Realm!\u2019\u201cNaturally, Yan Ji said this for Ye Chen\u2019s own good. Over the past few days, she had heard a lot of rumors about Ye Chen\u2019s cousin. The girl in purple was most-likely from an Ancient Immortal Family from the Upper Realm.One thing Yan Ji didn\u2019t doubt was:\u00a0\u2018for a Family like that, Ye Chen\u2019s current background, talent, and cultivation base weren\u2019t worth mentioning. To them, bloodline mattered more than individuals.\u2019\u2018Once they found out that Ye Chen was getting too close with this cousin of his, they would most-likely send someone to kill Ye Chen in the cradle.\u2019\u201cMaster, I understand your considerations, but Master, you don\u2019t need to worry about my and Liuli\u2019s matter.\u201dYe Chen shook his head, and responded with a cold tone after listening to her words. Obviously, he had also received the news from the Moon-facing Ancient City, and that brought him a pleasant surprise. To him, the news was nothing short of receiving heavy rain after a long drought.His cousin was his biggest backer!Yet, his Master actually wanted him to not contact his cousin \u2014 why was that?His cousin came from a terrifying background, so why couldn\u2019t he have contact with her? Was his Master afraid that he would gain an even mightier backer than Gu Changge?Ye Chen\u2019s heart turned cold as those thoughts crossed his mind.As for his cousin\u2019s family sending someone to murder him? He disregarded that as nothing but nonsense. He didn\u2019t believe anyone had the guts to do something like that to him, with his cousin by his side.Ye Chen felt at ease after he considered his cousin\u2019s feelings and attitude towards him. As for his Master? Ye Chen was so disappointed in her that he no longer wanted to continue their conversation.\u2026\u2026The news regarding the opening of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm soon spread throughout the Middle State.Dazzling, heavenly brilliance illuminated the area where the eight regions of the Middle State intersected, attracting the attention of innumerable forces and cultivators.Any news about the birth of a magical treasure, or the opening of a secret realm, could easily cause a massive sensation all over the world. Such events always attracted mighty forces and big shots, and everyone would come rushing like sharks that had smelled blood.The opening of this Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm was no different.Many Holy Lands, Ancient Dynasties, and other large and small forces of the Middle State immediately sent their people. The same was true for factions of the rest of the world, and all of them were afraid of missing this massive opportunity.Secret Realms didn\u2019t form out of nowhere, and the process that created them was extremely rare and unfathomable. Some formed over massive spans of time, while others were left behind by mythical existences and worked as the inheritances of said existences.No matter how small a Secret Realm, once it opened, it would give birth to innumerable Heavenly Treasures, thick Spiritual Qi, Ancient Medicinal Herbs and Plants, Spiritual Ores, and so on\u2026Before long, this remote town turned into the most prosperous part of the region. Every day, more and more cultivators and creatures arrived, attracted by the legendary Secret Realm.Unfortunately, people discovered that not everyone had the fortune to enter the Secret Realm. The entrance of the Secret Realm had a layer of extremely terrifying barriers that gave a horrible backlash to anyone beyond the Great-Transcendent Realm.Any intruder who broke through the restriction would be obliterated on the spot, causing a great tempest of Heavenly Energies in the Secret Realm.The Emperors and Holy Lords of the various forces were left helpless. If they wanted to enter, they would need to suppress their cultivation and make sure they didn\u2019t release their true auras. For this reason, they decided to only send their disciples and elders of the Great-Transcendent Realm to the Secret Realm for experience.\u2026\u2026\u2018It seems that everything is going according to my expectations. This Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm is a special playground prepared to give Ye Chen a boost.\u2019\u2018The inheritance of a Quasi-Supreme is just about right to boost a Favored Son of Heaven!\u2019\u2018Tsk, since cultivators above the Great-Transcendent Realm can\u2019t enter without suppressing their cultivation, then I presume this Secret Realm should push Ye Chen\u2019s cultivation to the Great-Transcendent Realm in one fell swoop\u2026\u2019\u201cWhat a wonderful coincidence! I never thought the Secret Realm would open at such an opportune time.\u201dGu Changge stood atop a mountain with his hands behind his back, and overlooked everything that happened on the scene around the Secret Realm. An expression of interest covered his face as he uttered words that the Ancient Lin Family\u2019s powerhouses behind him couldn\u2019t comprehend.They couldn\u2019t comprehend his words, nor did they have the guts to ask Young Lord Gu what he meant by his words. With their lips tightly sealed, they stood behind him with respectful expression.It was better to keep quiet sometimes.Gu Changge had decided to bring along some people from the Ancient Lin Family since he couldn\u2019t just do everything all by himself. If something trivial and cumbersome came up, he could make them take care of it.As for the limit imposed by the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm? The reason wasn\u2019t all that hard for Gu Changge to guess \u2014 he didn\u2019t even need to put in any effort thinking about it.After all, the Secret Realm was an experience ground prepared specifically for the Favored Son of Heaven, so how could it allow others to come in and steal his boost?What\u2019s more? The Secret Realm was left behind by a Quasi-Supreme, so even Old Ming, a mighty God King, would have to suppress his cultivation to the Great-Transcendent Realm before he entered.Gu Changge tut-tutted[1] in his heart. This treatment wasn\u2019t something any random Lu, Bu, or Du could enjoy. The Heavenly Daddy deliberately rigged opportunities and benefits in favor of the Favored Children of Heaven.[1: tut-tut is an exclamation used to express disapproval or annoyance.]It was no different from presenting well-cooked meat on a golden plate, and then feeding it to them, too![VILFIC: normally, Favored Kids can fight far above their levels. Since Ye Chen is at the peak of the Transcendent Realm now, he can easily obliterate any Great-Transcendent (normal or Saints who suppressed themselves) from the Lower Realm. This is how the game is rigged in his favor.]But, so what?Since he wanted to rob the Favored Son of Heaven\u2019s opportunity, even the Heavenly Daddy should forget about stopping him.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dCommanding with a faint voice, Gu Changge took the lead and headed towards the entrance of the Secret Realm not too far away, leaving behind a rainbow in his wake.Even if he could only use the might of the Great-Transcendent Realm in the Secret Realm, it wouldn\u2019t be hard for him to kill Ye Chen.This leek had fattened enough, and it was about time to harvest him.[Boom!]The entrance of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm was a thirty feet wide crack in space that exuded a hazy glow. Space around the crack fluctuated, and it connected the world to the dimension of the Secret Realm.Many cultivators stood around the entrance, and watched it with eyes full of desire.Many loose cultivators[2] from all around the world had gathered. There were those of the Great-Transcendent Realm, and even behemoths of the Saint Realm hidden among the crowd.[2: loose cultivators are any cultivators who aren\u2019t associated with a Clan, Sect, Family, Organization, Holy Land, Dynasty, or whatever.]Their idea was simple:\u00a0\u2018if they entered by themselves, they wouldn\u2019t be able to guarantee a haul and would also need to contend with people from various forces for the opportunities. Instead, they would wait outside the Secret Realm, and directly steal from those who had already gone inside, once they came out.\u2019\u201cWho are they?\u201d\u201cThey look like people from the Ancient Lin Family.\u201dSoon, they saw a black-clothed man coming towards the entrance of the Secret Heavenly Realm with powerful cultivators of the Ancient Lin Family following behind him.\u201cHe\u2019s that Young Lord!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t provoke them!\u201dThe cultivators gathered together were stunned by their sudden appearance, and their expressions couldn\u2019t help but change drastically. Scared, they retreated in a hurry.Of all the powers in the world, the only one they feared was the Ancient Lin Family. Of course, the one they truly feared was the Young Lord who was staying in the Ancient Lin Family.As long as one was from the Middle State, there\u2019s no way they wouldn\u2019t know about the Young Lord from the Upper Realm; they could easily recognize him by his black robe, tall figure, and godly temperament!He was a character they could absolutely not provoke!At this time, all of them involuntarily retreated from the entrance of the Secret Realm in a hurry, leaving the place clear.[Hum!]A powerful ripple spread around, and brilliant runes flashed.Gu Changge naturally couldn\u2019t care less about this bunch of loose cultivators. With his group of followers, he directly entered the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm!The world around them (Gu Changge\u2019s group) spun, and they felt as if they were floating through a spatial tunnel!Soon, the aura of the Secret Realm descended upon them, and Gu Changge recovered his balance mid-air. With his cultivation suppressed to the peak of the Great-Transcendent Realm, he safely landed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Soon, a crack appeared in the air, and several figures emerged from the crack.They were Gu Changge and his group.The expression of the cultivators in the surroundings showed a drastic change. Although they didn\u2019t know Gu Changge\u2019s identity, they were smart enough to know that someone who could bring along so many followers of the Great-Transcendent Realm wasn\u2019t someone they could afford to provoke.Gu Changge chuckled at their reactions \u2014 it was exactly as he expected it to be. Only an idiot would dare come forward and mess with him at this moment. After all, he wasn\u2019t a Protagonist who was destined to be ridiculed no matter where he went.[Inside the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm.]The mountains towered through the clouds, and rivers snaked around on the ground. The sky above appeared to be unreachable, and the earth looked like a vast sea of green. Rich Spiritual Qi permeated every corner of the Realm, and it was as if it would liquify at any moment now.For Gu Changge, someone who grew up up in the Upper Realm where extremely dense Spiritual Qi permeated everywhere, the level of Spiritual Qi in this Realm was nothing more than what he had seen outside his Gu Family\u2019s gates. It wasn\u2019t worth mentioning.But, to the cultivators of the Lower Realm, this place was like a sacred land for cultivation. One day of hard-work here could equal many days of labor outside. This brought great shock and envy to their hearts.\u201cA Secret Realm like this is indeed a boon! No wonder so many people rush to enter as soon as these open\u2026\u201d\u201cIt could be a great place for cultivation if it stayed open perpetually! Unfortunately, it will close down sooner or later.\u201dThe people of the Ancient Lin Family couldn\u2019t help but breathe sighs of regret. They were here to do Gu Changge\u2019s bidding, so they could obviously not move around freely and enjoy the blessings of the Secret Realm. Still, if they could receive Young Lord Gu\u2019s appreciation, they might obtain opportunities far greater than this Secret Realm in the future.This much was still clear to them.\u201cThis is an extremely important matter for the Young Lord, so don\u2019t even think about returning if you mess anything up!\u201dOld Ming gave his descendants a stern warning. He had also suppressed his cultivation to enter the Secret Realm as he didn\u2019t feel comfortable letting Gu Changge enter alone.\u201cAncestor, you can rest assured! Even if we have to die in here, we will make sure Young Lord Gu obtains what he desires.\u201dAll the Elders of the Ancient Lin Family fell to their knees and pledged solemnly after listening to their Ancestor\u2019s warning.Old Ming nodded in satisfaction at their performance.\u2018The Secret Realm only opened a few days ago, so Ye Chen should have only arrived at the edge of the Secret Realm\u2019s core region, no matter how fast he might me\u2026\u2019\u2018If I am not wrong, then he should also have a map of this place in his possession. He\u2019s not a treasure-hunting tool for nothing \u2014 I will allow him to clear the path for me.\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t care less about the people behind him. An inexplicable smile adorned his face, and he thought about Ye Chen\u2019s matter in his heart. He could easily sense Ye Chen\u2019s exact location, and calculated that Ye Chen wasn\u2019t too far away from them. He was, at most, a few thousand miles away.Although Gu Changge couldn\u2019t see Ye Chen\u2019s every move, he could still guess what he might be up to. Ye Chen might have looked like a defeated dog when he provoked him at the start, but right now, Gu Changge thought that his visage looked more handsome than anyone else\u2019.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but laugh, after all, Ye Chen was busy preparing a Fortuitous Opportunity for him.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dDone with his thoughts, he uttered his command for the ones behind him, and then turned into a brilliant flash of light that headed towards the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm\u2019s core region. Right now, they were at the Secret Realm\u2019s outer edge.\u2026\u2026[In an area shrouded in mist.]The mountains pierced through the clouds, ancient trees towered high, and one could see many ruins with collapsed palaces, pavilions, and shattered pillars scattered around with dead leaves.[Shua!]Blood splattered around as Ye Chen slashed a strange-looking beast in front of him in half, and then looked at a plant at the entrance of a nearby cave with a smile on his face.The plant burned bright like a flame, and released a scorching aura in its surroundings.\u201c[Flame God\u2019s Flower], and it\u2019s thirty-thousand years old at that\u2026not only can it help me condense my True Flame, but it will also raise my comprehension of the Flame Dao to another height\u2026\u201dYe Chen muttered to himself while harvesting the flaming plant.Satisfaction filled his heart. He had obtained a lot of good stuff on this trip to the Secret Realm, and received another boost to his cultivation base. This compounded his happiness and confidence, and he came up with even more plans to deal with Gu Changge.Of course, Ye Liuli was the biggest reason behind the sudden boost in his might.After Ye Liuli hit an iron-plate in the Moon-facing Ancient City, he did his best to have someone pass his message off to her so she wouldn\u2019t worry about his safety.Although many cultivators in the world knew he had offended Gu Changge, and avoided him like a plague, there were also cultivators who were willing to lend him a hand. Just like the Buddhist Holy Land\u2019s Holy Son, there were many others in the world with justice in their hearts who were won over by Ye Chen\u2019s charisma. They were more than willing to uphold justice by helping deliver his message to Ye Liuli.Just like that, Ye Liuli found Ye Chen within a few days.Ye Liuli came together with a bunch of her servants who were from the Ancient Sacred Mountains, and every single one of them was in the Great-Transcendent Realm, or higher. This gave Ye Chen a deep sense of security.Once Gu Changge came into the Secret Realm, he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave. With his preparations, Gu Changge\u2019s death was set in stone. On this date next year would be Gu Changge\u2019s memorial day!It\u2019s just that one thing confused Ye Chen a little. Ye Liuli wasn\u2019t as affectionate towards him as before, nor did she talk to him as much as before. She even made sure to keep a distance of three steps between them.Still, Ye Chen didn\u2019t think too much into this matter. After all, Ye Liuli had grown up \u2014 she was no longer the little girl he used to know. Moreover, their background was too different, so it was normal to have this much change.After putting the [Flame God\u2019s Flower] in his spatial ring, Ye Chen turned his attention towards a gorgeous girl dressed in purple not too far away from him. A satisfied smile appeared on his face as he gazed upon her milky, jade-like skin and colorful crystal-like eyes.Ye Liuli had grown up and turned out even more stunning. She had an ethereal temperament, and a hazy brilliance shrouded her figure, making her looking like a goddess.\u201cMove your dog eyes! How dare you covet our Lady? How dare the toad descendent of a slave dream about eating swan meat?\u201d [1][1: \u2018toad desiring swan meat\u2019 \u2014 an ugly piece of trash desiring a beautiful lady.]Right then, a grating voice full of disdain fell into Ye Chen\u2019s ears, causing him to frown. His expression sank, and his face turned ugly.It was that damn woman again!Every time she opened her damn mouth, she would call him an ant or a toad \u2014 she just couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut!Although many had ridiculed Ye Chen over his life, he had always turned the situation around and given them a tight slap to their ugly faces. But the person looking down on him this time was Ye Liuli\u2019s retainer; this made it hard for him to retaliate, and he could only swallow his rage without any outlet to vent.The one who spoke was none other than Ye Liuli\u2019s Aunt Xue.Although Ye Liuli had scolded her after they returned, she couldn\u2019t vent too much on her and had to give up after a few words. After all, Aunt Xue had watched over her for more than a decade, so she couldn\u2019t possibly be too harsh on her.And, when Ye Liuli rushed to find Ye Chen, Aunt Xue naturally suppressed her own cultivation and followed her into the Secret Realm.She didn\u2019t like this Ye Chen at all. In her opinion, he was a bastard who couldn\u2019t keep his hands and feet to himself. When her Lady was young, this scum would always stay by her side and try different means to take advantage of her. If she wasn\u2019t there to stop this kid\u2019s advances, she didn\u2019t know how far he would have gone with taking her Lady\u2019s advantage.Aunt Xue had thought about killing Ye Chen back then, but her Lady had stopped her since she wouldn\u2019t have anyone to talk to otherwise.But now, Aunt Xue\u2019s desire to clean this world of this scum was getting stronger. For a mere Ye Chen, her Lady had gone and provoked the Young Lord of the Gu Family.That was an utterly stupid thing to do!Unfortunately, she was in her Lady\u2019s presence, and her cultivation was also suppressed to the Great-Transcendent Realm, so she couldn\u2019t easily obliterate him without letting her Lady know.\u201cDon\u2019t look down on others this much! I have trampled many who looked down on me under my feet.\u201dYe Chen frowned and spoke without a shred of politeness.Aunt Xue sneered at his words, and said, \u201cWith just you? You, who haven\u2019t even seen the true Dragons from the Ninth Heaven, want respect from us? Why don\u2019t you take a look at yourself in a mirror first! How can someone as pathetic as you be compared to Young Lord Gu?\u201d\u201cOnly someone like Young Lord Gu is a good match for my Lady! You aren\u2019t even qualified to be killed under Young Lord Gu\u2019s feet.\u201dNaturally, Aunt Xue spoke from the bottom of her heart. Of course, she didn\u2019t know that her honest words had exponentially increased Ye Chen\u2019s hatred for Gu Changge.\u201cShut the heck up\u2026\u201dDark, blue veins covered Ye Chen\u2019s forehead and he tightly clenched his fists. He almost roared out at Aunt Xue. No matter how tolerant he might be, he couldn\u2019t bear her bull-crap anymore.How dare she say that the girl he liked was a good match for his enemy? Just what the heck was that supposed to mean? Wasn\u2019t that nothing short of putting a green hat[2] over his damn head?[2: putting a green hat on someone\u2019s head means cuckolding them. Cuckolding someone means stealing their wife or lover.]Gu Changge! Why was it Gu Changge again?!Every time she opened her mouth, she spoke of Gu Changge, and every time she closed her mouth, she praised Gu Changge first!Ye Chen\u2019s eyes turned red, and he gnashed his teeth.He wanted to slaughter Gu Changge right then and there!\u201cBrother Ye Chen, don\u2019t listen to her!\u201d\u201cAunt Xue, what nonsense are you speaking?!\u201dYe Liuli came over with furrowed brows, and showed a dissatisfied expression at the exchange between them.Although Ye Chen had changed a lot from before, he was still her Brother Ye Chen. She could accept the change in him at the current level.Aunt Xue had said too much!\u201cMy Lady, I am merely speaking the truth. If it wasn\u2019t for this guy, Young Lord Gu wouldn\u2019t have treated you like that! Between him and\u2026\u201dAunt Xue spoke up to explain herself, but Ye Liuli interrupted her before she could finish her words.With a frown of displeasure masking her face, she said, \u201cAunt Xue, don\u2019t talk about that whatever Gu in front of me \u2014 I don\u2019t want to hear his damned name anymore.\u201d\u201cLiuli, there wouldn\u2019t be a marriage engagement between the two of you, right?\u201dYe Chen, who had just calmed down, suddenly thought of something and asked. Nervousness and restlessness clawed at his heart.After all, why else would Aunt Xue deliberately mention Gu Changge in front of him again and again? Both of them were from the Upper Realm, and both of them came from terrifying backgrounds, so there was a high chance for something like that to be possible between their families.Ye Chen felt extremely uncomfortable as he thought about this.\u201cWhat nonsense are you thinking about? How could I possibly be engaged to a man as nasty as him? Even if there\u2019s an engagement between him and I, I will force my father to annul it\u2026\u201dHis words left Ye Liuli somewhat speechless, and she explained with some feelings of helplessness. How could her Brother Ye Chen even think about something like that? Gu Changge was a wicked bastard who humiliated her, and she hated him from the bottom of her heart.\u201cWhy do you hate him then? What happened at the Ancient Lin Family that day?\u201dYe Chen breathed a sigh of relief, but still asked. How could someone as gentle as Ye Liuli develop hatred for someone without a reason? At the same time, his killing intent towards Gu Changge also deepened.\u201cGu Changge is from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family in the Upper Realm\u2026not only that, he\u2019s the Gu Family\u2019s Young Master. His position and backing is above mine, so if you want to deal with him, you have to be very careful, Brother Ye Chen\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be able to help you.\u201dYe Liuli explained.Ye Chen\u2019s fists clenched even tighter as he heard her words, but he still muttered in his heart,\u00a0\u2018This Secret Realm will be Gu Changge\u2019s grave!\u2019Yan Ji, who was inside the ring, immediately showed interest at Ye Liuli\u2019s words. She had wanted to know more about Gu Changge for a while already.\u2018So Young Lord Gu is the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family? No wonder\u2026\u2019\u2018Well, he must have a lot of life-preserving means then, so I don\u2019t need to worry about him.\u2019She heaved a sigh of relief at the conflict in her heart. She had continuously asked herself who she would help if Ye Chen and Gu Changge fought?\u2018I hope that situation doesn\u2019t come to pass, or I won\u2019t know who to help between the two\u2026\u2019Yan Ji couldn\u2019t help but sigh.At that time, her remnant spirit was already in desperate straits. To her, the value of the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill] at that moment was immeasurable, and she couldn\u2019t forget this kindness of Gu Changge.Sill, there was one thing she couldn\u2019t comprehend:\u00a0\u2018why did Young Lord Gu let Ye Chen provoke him without any retaliation?\u2019Was Ye Chen simply lucky in that situation, or did Young Lord Gu spare his life for her sake, since he wanted to bring her to his side?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one found any signs of the Realm\u2019s inheritance even after half a month of its initial opening. On the contrary, the cultivators who entered chanced upon innumerable ruins with tattered corpses.The decayed clothes worn by the corpses showed extremely ancient patterns, and the way they died was also strange. Some appeared as if they had committed suicide, and others seemed to have been killed by their acquaintances.Some of the ruins contained murals, patterns, and paintings that recorded the events that transpired in this Secret Realm. Some old cultivators who had studied ancient languages and culture started to decipher the records, and soon came up with an understanding that left them in great shock!\u201cThis is a land created to seal something; not only does it contain great opportunities, but there are also great horrors that dwell within it!\u201d\u201cThe creator of this Secret Realm is an Honored Supreme[1] with an extremely ancient origin dating back to immemorial times\u2026\u201d[1: it\u2019s a Quasi-Supreme but the people of Lower Realm call it an Honored Supreme since they don\u2019t have enough knowledge about Realms and titles beyond False God.]*\u201cHonored Supreme?!\u201dWhat kind of concept was that? They had only seen a few words regarding those existences in ancient records. Existences of those level could easily travel through the void, pick the stars, and grasp the moon.False Gods were nothing but ants in front of them.This discovery shook the entire Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm and brought great excitement to all the cultivators who had entered.Won\u2019t they soar to Heaven in a single leap if they could get the inheritance of that Honored Supreme and become his successor? Even going to the Upper Realm wouldn\u2019t be hard at that point!But the cultivators who were deciphering the records soon showed a drastic change in their expressions, and terror gripped their hearts. With trembling voices, they splashed a bucket of cold water over everyone\u2019s heads.\u201cThis is a place sealing a great terror that almost destroyed all living beings, and even the Honored Supreme and his people lost their lives dealing with it! The Honored Supreme burned their own life and origin to seal that supreme evil, preventing him from coming out into the world\u2026\u201d\u201cThat supreme evil is a devil that can bring great chaos in the world, and turn everything upside-down. Once it is released, it will destroy the world and massacre all the creatures and races that live in it\u2026\u201dThey couldn\u2019t help but feel their hearts freeze as they studied the ancient records. This Secret Realm wasn\u2019t an opportunity, but a place where that hid a great devil within it! This terrifying news caused an even more frightening sensation than the first one.Many cultivators felt cold sweat drip down their backs.As for what this supreme devil was? The records did not mention it.It\u2019s just that the horror of the supreme devil was self-evident, considering an Honored Supreme had to sacrifice their life just to seal it. They estimated that it was a calamity that could devastate the world to the point of extinction.Many cultivators immediately retreated with cold shivers going down their backs. They felt a creepy feeling claw at their hearts when they considered that the ground they stood upon might be hiding countless bones under it!Immediately, a place of fortuitous encounters turned into a purgatory that they had to avoid at all costs.This news spread like wildfire, and shocked even the people of the world outside the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm!\u201cI heard that the Young Lord from the Upper Realm has also gone inside the Secret Realm! It seems that this Secret Realm was the reason he descended down to our Lower Realm.\u201d\u201cJust what is hidden inside this Secret Realm? Why are even people from the Upper Realm interested in it?\u201dThe information and questions shocked and confused many cultivators.Soon, a cultivator discovered an area covered in fog in the depths of the Secret Realm. The fog started out white, but its color turned darker the further in one went, until it turned from gray to pitch-black.Not only that, but it also seemed to cast some evil sorcery on whoever approached it. Many ferocious beasts lost their minds and rushed out from their dens to attack the cultivators who had entered the Secret Realm.Even some cultivators with weaker cultivation bases were affected by the fog, and lost their minds. They turned into mindless killing machines who attacked everyone and anyone in their surroundings.This earth-shattering change destroyed the peace of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm. Many cultivators decided to retreat immediately as a mere opportunity could never be as important as their life.Of course, there were also cultivators who rushed towards the depths of the Secret Realm. Since ancient times, opportunities and danger have gone hand-in-hand. What others called a disaster might just be a blessing in disguise!But they soon discovered that the deeper they went the thicker the fog became. Dangers were everywhere, and they could lose their way \u2014 life, even \u2014 if they took one wrong step. Worse still, there were many formations and other trap mechanisms on the path. If they touched any of them by accident, then they would find themselves in a deadly situation.Many cultivators were already buried like that.What nonsense was it about this being a place full of opportunities? This was clearly a burial ground for the masses!The entire Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm went into chaos for a period of time.\u201cSuch a low-leveled Devil Qi can only affect ordinary cultivators. It won\u2019t do anything to people who have cultivated for a long time.\u201dGu Changge casually remarked while standing at the edge of the demonic fog. Anyone who had cultivated for a respectable amount of time could easily resist the invasion of this Devil Qi.For him, though, this Devil Qi was the purest form of nourishment in the world. It\u2019s just that there was too little of it here for it to be of any help to him.He guessed that it was caused by the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]. It was truly worthy of being known as a peerless weapon \u2014 it had barely started to wake up, yet it was already causing such havoc.Gu Changge felt satisfied thinking about it.The core of the Secret Realm was just ahead; he could already feel the presence of Ye Chen among the many others inside. His Devil Heart was also moving about excitedly, desiring to swallow the source of all the Devil Qi in his surroundings.\u201cMy Lord, this area is somewhat weird, and we might lose our way if we don\u2019t know the path. This old slave thinks we should be more cautious around here.\u201dOld Ming voiced his concerns.He could feel a terrifying power of suppression inside this Secret Realm. He was sure that he would be immediately repelled by the Realm if he showed an ounce of aura beyond the Great-Transcendent Realm.Gu Changge responded to him with a nod, but his face showed a calm and unconcerned expression.\u201cIt\u2019s alright! I have someone to lead the way, so you only need to follow after me.\u201dSaying that, Gu Changge closed his eyes and focused on the mark he had left behind on the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill]. Immediately, he felt a faint connection from the mark.[Hum!]A faint thread of black silk unfolded before Gu Changge\u2019s eyes, extending towards the depths of the fog in front of him.This was the path Ye Chen walked. Without him, it would be much harder for Gu Changge to traverse through the fog. After all, he didn\u2019t have a map, so he would need to go around in circles over and over again to find reach the actual core of the Secret Realm.Of course, it was also possible that he would never find it.Gu Changge, however, never even considered looking for a map or anything of the sort; that was too troublesome.Since Ye Chen was working so hard for him, wouldn\u2019t he (Gu Changge) be doing himself a disservice by not picking his (Ye Chen\u2019s) fruit of labor?Old Ming and the others were naturally not worried anymore after they heard Gu Changge\u2019s words. Since the Young Lord had said it, he would naturally have a way.Gu Changge stepped into the fog first, and his followers of the Great-Transcendent Realm gathered around him and kept a vigilant eye on their surroundings to prevent some beast or anything else from attacking him.Naturally, Gu Changge\u2019s group was attacked several times along the way, but all the attacks were from mindless beasts who were affected by the Devil Qi. Old Ming and the others easily dealt with them, without needing Gu Changge to move a finger.As for cultivators? No one had the guts to attack their group.\u2018According to the path Ye Chen took, the inheritance of this Secret Realm should be deep underground. The [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] should also be there\u2026\u2019Gu Changge kept walking ahead while paying attention to the traces left behind by Ye Chen. An expression of interest appeared on his face as he noticed that they faced a lot less beasts when they followed in Ye Chen\u2019s steps. He had even cleared the powerful formations and traps on the way.Gu Changge felt warmth spread in his heart.\u2018This is a path specifically cleared for me! Ye Chen, you are such a gentleman\u2026\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. If Ye Chen could know his thoughts at this moment, he would most certainly spurt blood from his mouth and wish to grind his bones into dust.\u2026\u2026[In the depth of the fog at this time.]Ye Chen and his party finally managed to slaughter the beast in front of them. Right now, a pale, gray bleakness enveloped the world around them.\u2018The entrance is here according to the map\u2026\u2019Ye Chen\u2019s heart inflated with excitement. Following the directions on the map, he quickly found a passage on the ground.\u201cBrother Ye Chen, your strength has improved by leaps and bounds in only a few years.\u201dYe Liuli exclaimed. She was amazed by Ye Chen\u2019s heroic might and ability to kill those stronger than himself. She was stunned when he killed a beast in the middle stage of the Great Power Realm.These demonic beasts were infected by Devil Qi. Not only did they not fear death, but they also didn\u2019t feel pain. They only knew how to slaughter everything in their surroundings, and their strength was also greater than cultivators of the same Realm.Ye Chen, on the other hand, was only at the peak of the Transcendent Realm, yet he could easily kill beings stronger than himself.\u201cLiuli, you flatter me!\u201dYe Chen first felt overwhelmed when he saw Ye Liuli watching him with an expression full of shock, and then he felt proud of himself.But soon, he got down to business.\u201cThe inheritance of this Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm\u2019s master should be down there! Let\u2019s go down immediately; although we haven\u2019t come across anyone else in a while, we still shouldn\u2019t take any risks and stay out here in the dark\u2026\u201dYe Chen said to his group. He was worried that Gu Changge might appear before them out of nowhere.He didn\u2019t doubt the fact that Gu Changge would certainly come to this Secret Realm. It was just that he had yet to see any of his traces, and that brought his some a little uneasiness.Ye Chen couldn\u2019t help but admit that Gu Changge indeed put him under a lot of pressure.\u2018Even if he comes inside, he will end up trapped in the fog without a map.\u2019[VILFIC: \u2014 thought the map.]Ye Chen\u2019s heart relaxed as he thought about this. What\u2019s more? He still had the Secret Realm\u2019s key which he could use to manipulate the traps and formations.\u2018Tsk, just a lucky bastard. How can he compare to Young Lord Gu even if he got some good opportunities?\u2019Aunt Xue thought with disdain.Soon, they descended through the passage and arrived underground.\u201cIs this a mausoleum?\u201d [1][VILFIC: Mausoleum is the big word for museum of dead big shots.]**Ye Chen was a little shocked as he walked down the corridor, avoiding many traps and formations along the way.The sight in front of him shocked not just him, but everyone else, too!The place was like a mausoleum.It looked like an ancient structure with all sorts of buildings, dilapidated shrines, ancient wooden halls, and floating mansions.It was the corner of an ancient city hidden under the ground!\u201cThe Devil Qi here is getting stronger and stronger. According to the map, there should be a palace in the depths of this place, and the inheritance should be in that palace\u2026\u201dYe Chen\u2019s excitement soared. He had finally reached his target, and he would be able to get the inheritance after a few more steps![Roar!][Roar!][Roar!]Right then, terrifying roars sounded from all around them, and pairs of blood-red eyes lit up in their surrounding darkness.Ye Chen\u2019s expression fell as he watched ferocious beasts and walking corpses close in on them.\u201cAll of them are in the Great-Transcendent Realm\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to be delayed any longer. The unease in his heart deepened with every moment, and he felt that something terrifying might happen if he couldn\u2019t get the inheritance soon.Also, why was his Master so quiet today?!\u201cBrother Ye Chen, hurry up and go! We will help you hold back these beasts. Time is running out, so you shouldn\u2019t stay here any longer\u2026\u201dYe Liuli decisively proclaimed with a calm expression. She had brought along a lot of servants, so they should be able to hold back these beasts while Ye Chen received the inheritance.\u201cAlright! Liuli, you must hold on \u2014 I will come and help you as soon as I have received the inheritance!\u201dYe Chen\u2019s heart was moved, and he rushed towards the depths of the ancient underground city without looking back.The wave of beasts, on the other hand, rushed forward and surrounded Ye Liuli and her group.\u2026\u2026Right when Ye Chen rushed towards the depths of the ancient city, Gu Changge arrived at its edge. A faint smirk appeared on his face as he watched the scene in front of him.After all, he hadn\u2019t needed to clean up a horde of beasts, nor had he encountered any traps or formations. His group had easily arrived here without much effort!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLeaked Whereabouts; Exploding Protagonist!As soon as Gu Changge appeared, Ye Liuli and her group noticed his presence even though they were busy fighting the beasts and corpses.\u2018Gu Changge?! Why is he here? And how did he arrive here so fast?\u2019His sudden appearance surprised Ye Liuli, and her complexion paled as various thoughts went through her mind. Although Gu Changge claimed that he didn\u2019t intend to kill Ye Chen, nor could he be bothered by his existence, those were just words. Who could guarantee the words that he uttered weren\u2019t all lies?When she had thought about the matter after leaving the Moon-facing Ancient City, she had felt that there was something wrong about the entire thing. Gu Changge definitely had something to gain from her Brother Ye Chen, or he would have never kept him alive.As for what he wanted to gain through him? Ye Liuli couldn\u2019t figure it out at that time.But now, she guessed that he was after something that existed in this Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm. A mere inheritance left behind by a Quasi-Supreme wasn\u2019t enough to move someone with Gu Changge\u2019s background and identity, to the point that he would descend to the Lower Realm. So he could only be here for something else hidden in the Ancient Secret Heavenly Realm!\u2018That\u2019s not right! According to Brother Ye Chen, only he has the map, so how did Gu Changge find this place so quickly? And why does his group appear as if they arrived here without facing any trouble? Did they not encounter beasts and traps along the way?\u2019This realization shocked the puzzled Ye Liuli, and her heart sank.\u2018He must have followed behind us, or left something on Brother Ye Chen to track him \u2014 that was his plan all along!\u2019Ye Liuli was indeed the little princess of the Ancient Immortal Ye Clan. Her keen mind was quick to think, and she immediately figured out the nuances of the matter.Her heart turned cold as she put the pieces together.Gu Changge was terrifying!How could he plan so far ahead? She had thought for a long time, and only now did she figure out the reason behind him not killing off her Brother Ye Chen right away.\u201cLooks like we got here right on time.\u201dGu Changge walked into the corridor, and swept his gaze upon the underground ancient city with a playful smile on his face.A calm expression showed on his face. His trip to this place had gone smoothly, and they only ran into a few troublesome beasts.The Great-Transcendent Realm people from the Ancient Lin Family, on the other hand, felt even more reverence for Gu Changge, and he was already a god in their hearts. After all, he easily found a safe route for their passage in a place as terrifying as this Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm.Of course, if Gu Changge heard their thoughts, he would ask them to thank Ye Chen for going in first. After all, he was merely following in the path cleared by Ye Chen.\u201cGu Changge, why are you here?\u201dYe Liuli glared at Gu Changge, and asked in a loud voice. At the same time, she stopped fighting the beast in front of her and stepped back.Naturally, she already knew the answer to her question; she was merely trying to delay Gu Changge to buy time for Ye Chen.\u201cWhy am I here? I am here because you helped clear the path for me. Speaking of which, I must thank you all!\u201dGu Changge responded with a smile.\u201cThank us? What don\u2019t I understand what you are talking about? Just what are you trying to do?\u201dYe Liuli asked aloud once more. By now, she was already sure of her guess:\u00a0\u2018Her Brother Ye Chen was playing in Gu Changge\u2019s hands, and Gu Changge had always known his whereabouts!\u2019Gu Changge fixed his gaze upon Ye Liuli\u2019s face, and said with a faint smile, \u201cIt\u2019s alright even if you don\u2019t understand. By the way, don\u2019t even think about delaying me here! Your mind is like an open book in front of me.\u201d[Boom!]As soon as Gu Changge finished his words, his Great-Transcendent Realm followers took action and started to blast away any beast that walked near Gu Changge.Immediately, the path in front of Gu Changge was cleared.Nothing could block his steps!If they compared numbers, then Gu Changge had brought a lot more people than Ye Liuli, and there was even a figure as mighty as Old Ming among his ranks. Even if his cultivation base was suppressed, ordinary cultivators couldn\u2019t compare to him.\u201cGu Changge\u2026\u201dYe Liuli\u2019s face paled.Although Aunt Xue was protecting her, she couldn\u2019t go as deep into the underground city as Gu Changge. After all, there were hordes of beasts flooding around them tide after tide.The beasts around Gu Changge, on the other hand, didn\u2019t appear normal. She felt as if their auras weakened the closer they got to Gu Changge. Something seemed to be sucking away their life force, but she couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.Gu Changge casually clapped, and all the beasts around him turned into ash.Ye Liuli\u2019s heart palpitated with deep anxiety as she watched everything transpire in front of her!She couldn\u2019t help but worry about Ye Chen. How could Ye Chen survive when facing an enemy like Gu Changge?\u201cOld Ming, guard this place and make sure no one comes leaves here.\u201dGu Changge muttered his command, and then went in the direction Ye Chen had previously gone to.As soon as Old Ming heard his command, he responded with a solemn vow, \u201cMy Lord, please rest assure! This old slave will make sure no one disturbs you today!\u201d[Boom!]Old Ming revealed his majestic and terrifying aura. At the same time, a crimson weapon covered with splendid runes appeared in his hands, radiating an oppressive aura.\u2026\u2026\u201cI must enter the palace as soon as possible, and gain control over the Secret Realm\u2019s core and formations to solve that beast tide! Liuli, wait for me \u2014 I will be there to help you right away!\u201dYe Chen gritted his teeth and muttered to himself. He had left alone at his fastest speed, leaving behind brilliant rays of light as he heading towards the depths of the underground city.Right now, the Key he had obtained previously glowed with a hazy light. It was the Key that could open the gate of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm\u2019s inheritance palace!\u201cI am here! My inheritance is here!\u201dYe Chen finally stopped after rushing at his top speed for half an hour. His body was drowned in sweat, and he gasped for air as soon as he appeared outside a dilapidated bronze gate.Excitement filled his heart as he saw the gate and realized that his efforts had finally paid off!He stopped in his tracks and didn\u2019t move forward anymore. In front of him stood a palace shrouded in gray fog. The surrounding air gave off a feeling of gloom and chills\u2026the aura was too strange.At the same time, he saw snow-white bones scattered on the ground, and that only increased the eeriness of this place. He also saw various ancient patterns engraved on aged, colorful stones. There were also fragments of rusted Mystical Weapons scattered around that looked like someone had dug them out from some greyish-red mud.Some of the fragments radiated a delicate light showing their former majesty from times immemorial, while others had marks of dried blood on them without a shred of divinity left over.\u201cA lot of people must have died here back then, so the palace might not be as safe you think it is. Make sure you are thoroughly prepared before opening it.\u201dYan Ji, who had kept quiet throughout the journey, finally spoke up and advised Ye Chen. She had noticed the strangeness of their surroundings, and couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy.It was precisely for this reason that she gave Ye Chen a reminder.\u201cI already prepared a lot of Pills to deal with the terrifying Devil Qi here, or the Devil Qi would have already corroded my mind\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster, you don\u2019t need to say anything \u2014 I came prepared!\u201dYe Chen didn\u2019t give much thought to her words, and took out the Key to open the gate of the inheritance palace. Now that things had come to this point, a word or two from Yan Ji wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him.What\u2019s more? Ye Liuli and the others were in a critical situation and fighting against that tide of beasts, so he didn\u2019t have the time to give too much thought to all these matters.Yan Ji couldn\u2019t help but sigh when she heard his words, and decided not to speak anymore.Finished speaking, Ye Chen looked at the Key of the inheritance palace. The Key was an ancient, compass-like thing that appeared to be on the verge of collapse. He had casually bought it from a roadside stall for a few spirit stones at some time.Ye Chen had never imagined that this broken toy would turn out to the Key to the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm\u2019s inheritance![Hum!]Right then, the compass-like key in his hand glowed, and a dazzling light erupted from it. Ye Chen felt something urge him forward, and he felt his head spin as stars passed before his eyes.Brilliant runes intertwined together and various ancient patterns floated around like clouds. One after another, multicolored rays of divine light blasted out from the compass and landed on the bronze gate in front of him, spreading into eight directions.Soon, a huge noise rumbled around, and the bronze gate of the palace opened. At the same time, an ancient, mighty aura burst forth from the depths of the palace, and Ye Chen felt as if he was standing before the maw of an ancient devil.Streams of Spiritual Qi from all over the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm rushed into the palace, and disappeared without a trace, just like a stone sinking into the sea.The hymns of the Great Dao sounded from inside the palace, giving a fascinating makeover to the gloomy surroundings.It was as if a supreme existence was preaching the Dao and chanting Heavenly scriptures inside the palace, desiring to help mortals ascend to Heaven.At the same time, whimpers sounded from the void, accompanied by hoarse cries.\u201cHate! Hate! Hate!\u201d\u201cI hate this! I hate this!\u201d\u201cSlaughter them!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cKill! Kill! Kill!\u201dAn extremely monstrous Devil Qi flooded out from the palace.Ye Chen\u2019s face paled, and he almost lost his balance when he saw the scene in the palace. His head buzzed, and blood vessels all over his body popped out and squirmed around. It was as if he had come face to face with an ancient god, and the desire to kneel on the ground clawed at his heart!A black halberd with an incomparably terrifying Devil Qi pierced through the body of a magnificent figure sitting on the throne inside the palace.\u201cWhere\u2019s the inheritance?\u201d\u2026\u2026Ye Chen reacted fast, and his eyes searched through the hall. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to walk around, and he could feel his skin crack open with his every movement.He wondered if this was the might left behind by the master of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm?His heart palpitated. It was too terrifying! So much so that he felt that it could easily reach into the sky and destroy the stars with a single swat.\u201cThe inheritance is inside the corpse.\u201dThe voice of a smiling young man fell into Ye Chen\u2019s ears out of nowhere. He froze on his spot, dumbfounded and horrified.This voice?!How was it possible?Ye Chen\u2019s eyes widened and his limbs froze. He felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar, and the coldness chilled his heart and body.What was going on?Where did Gu Changge\u2019s voice come from so suddenly? How come he hadn\u2019t felt his presence in the slightest?Ye Chen\u2019s vague unease finally materialized, and he realized that the matter wasn\u2019t as simple as he imagined.\u201cGu Changge, why are you here\u2026\u201dYe Chen turned around and asked while staring at Gu Changge.He tried his best to calm himself, for he knew that he couldn\u2019t be impulsive at such an important juncture of his life.\u201cYou really are stupid! I have been standing behind you since the beginning. It\u2019s just that I decided not to disturb your focus since you were so busy opening that gate for me.\u201dGu Changge said with a faint smirk, like a cat who had played the mouse.\u201cAs for why I am here? Why don\u2019t you ask yourself?\u201d\u201cBy the way, thank you for clearing the path for me!\u201dHe said playfully, and then his eyes full of satisfaction moved away from Ye Chen and landed on the terrifying, pitch-black halberd in the Hall.It was the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]!The ultimate reason behind his descent to the Lower Realm.Just the aura of the halberd satisfied Gu Changge, and he felt as if it could pierce through the Heavens!Ye Chen, on the other hand, showed an extremely ugly expression. His first thoughts were that Gu Changge had followed behind him from the beginning, and only showed himself now that he had opened the gate of the inheritance palace.It\u2019s just that he couldn\u2019t figure out how Gu Changge could achieve something like that?How could something like that be explained?\u2018Someone must have leaked my whereabouts\u2026\u2019\u2018Who around me knows my whereabouts like the back of their hand? The most likely culprit is\u2026Master?\u2019Ye Chen suddenly thought of this, and his expression worsened. His fists clenched tighter, and his body shook.Gu Changge, on the other hand, said with the same smile on his face, \u201cSenior Yan Ji, we haven\u2019t seen each other for a long time, so why don\u2019t you show yourself?\u201d\u201cMaster, was it really you?!\u201dYe Chen exploded in rage as soon as he heard his words, and, in his anger, took off the ring on his finger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he already suspected his Master and thought that she held ulterior motives behind staying with him, there was still a glimmer of hope in his heart.But now, that glimmer of hope was ruthlessly extinguished by Gu Changge!This compounded Ye Chen\u2019s rage, and he almost threw away the ring in his hand.Why would Gu Changge use such a friendly tone when talking to his Master if his Master wasn\u2019t in cahoots with him?Obviously, they had gotten tired of the play and no longer wanted to hide anything from him. After all, how else could they explain how Gu Changge found his way to his location, and arrived as quickly as him?Ye Chen\u2019s rage soared higher and higher, and he questioned Yan Ji.\u201cDid you stop speaking recently out of guilt? I treated you as my Master, yet you colluded with my enemy behind my back and plotted to harm me?\u201dHe ground his teeth and roared out in pain.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but praise his wit. Sure enough, just a few words of provocation from him were enough to send Ye Chen down a spiral of explosive rage.It was great to have a brain, but unfortunately, Ye Chen didn\u2019t have one\u2026especially, when his eyes were reddened by flames of hatred and jealousy.Yan Ji, who had prepared to not take any sides after seeing Gu Changge from inside the ring, was stunned by his words. What did Ye Chen mean by those words?Although she knew Ye Chen had started to doubt her after the recent events, she didn\u2019t think he was this far gone! She had never left the ring, so how could she inform Gu Changge of his whereabouts?Instead of reflecting on his own actions and self, and seeing if there was something wrong with him, he pushed all his doubts and suspicions on her!Alas!Yan Ji\u2019s cold personality didn\u2019t mean that she lacked other emotions, or couldn\u2019t get angry. Right now, she was thoroughly enraged, with a chilling aura spreading around her.The void trembled for a moment, and she emerged from the ring. Her red dress accentuated her beauty, and made her look like a gorgeous, flaming fairy, but the aura she radiated brought along a bone-chilling cold.\u201cYou disappoint me! I never thought I amounted to so little in your heart. From today on, the relationship between you and me is no more!\u201dYan Ji stared at Ye Chen through her blood-red eyes full of frost and disappointment, and uttered those words with complete indifference.She felt that her years of kindness had all gone to waste.Even a beast would be more loyal to their master if raised for such a long time. Some times, people could really be worse than beasts!The rage in Ye Chen\u2019s heart flared after listening to Yan Ji, and he glared at her with wrathful eyes.\u201cThe relationship between us already ended on the day you joined hands with Gu Changge to deal with me! Do you think I can\u2019t tell you are only showing your true colors now?\u201dAlthough he spoke with a sneer, Ye Chen\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t stop throbbing in pain.Why? Just why was this happening?Su Qingge betrayed him, and now, even his Master betrayed him! Could it be that even Ye Liuli would do the same to him?The Master and Disciple, who had accompanied each other for years, finally reached the point where the rift between them expanded to form an un-fillable chasm.\u201cSenior Yan Ji, you are still as graceful as before, and your complexion looks even better.\u201dGu Changge praised with a smile \u2014 he seemed to have no idea that the Master and Disciple in front of him were breaking apart.He had deliberately driven a wedge between the two back them. Although his method wasn\u2019t all that clever, it was fatal to the two of them at that time. Ye Chen feared death, while Yan Ji\u2019s remnant soul wasn\u2019t in a good condition.Of course, Gu Changge\u2019s method had an even greater impact on someone as envious, jealous, and suspicious as Ye Chen.Gu Changge was a very possessive man. How could any mere Favored Son of Heaven or anyone else stop him if he wanted to take a woman or something else from them?[Ding! Ye Chen and his Master have finally ended their relationship, and his Fortune Value has fallen below the Lower Ceiling!(1) Ye Chen lost 200 Points of Fortune Value. Host received 1000 Destiny Points!][1: When someone\u2019s Fortune reaches below the Lower Ceiling, they are close to losing all of their Fortune Value. It\u2019s danger level for the Favored Runts.]Right then, the sound of the System\u2019s Prompt sounded in Gu Changge\u2019s mind, but he ignored it. After all, everything happened according to his plan.Since he said back then that he wanted Ye Chen\u2019s Master for himself, then he would obviously fulfill his words even if he needed to use some tricks.Yan Ji turned her gaze towards Gu Changge, and replied in a faint voice, \u201cYoung Lord Gu, you flatter me! It\u2019s all thanks to the [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pill] I received from you, or I wouldn\u2019t know how long it would take me to reach this level by just depending on Ye Chen. There\u2019s a chance that my remnant soul would dissipate before I could reconstruct my body\u2026\u201dAlthough Gu Changge\u2019s words were somewhat provocative, they didn\u2019t disgust her.Ye Chen\u2019s performance was all in front of her, so no matter what Gu Changge said now, his words would obviously sound more pleasant to her ears.Ye Chen\u2019s face paled further as he listened to Yan Ji\u2019s words, and he turned green in rage. His teeth creaked, and he almost exploded on the spot.Yan Ji stayed indifferent, and didn\u2019t even bother looking at Ye Chen anymore. This disciple had shattered her heart.Since Ye Chen held no respect or trust in her, and the Master and Disciple relationship between them was already already over, there was no way she would bother about him ever again.Although Ye Chen\u2019s words were spoken in an extremely emotional state, they reflected the deepest truth of his heart.\u201cIt seems Ye Chen misunderstood you quite deeply\u2026\u201dGu Changge showed an expression of surprise. There was no way he would miss this chance to rub salt on the wound.Yan Ji deeply looked at him, and said with a shake of her head, \u201cIt\u2019s not a misunderstanding\u2026well, it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201dGu Changge\u2019s face showed an expression of regret and self-blame as he heard her words, and he said, \u201cIt seems that my words just now made Ye Chen think that you were the one who leaked his whereabouts to me?\u201dSince he needed to pretend to be a gentleman, there was no way he wouldn\u2019t. What\u2019s more? He knew how to put on a flawless act.There was no way Gu Changge would let anyone find out the truth right now, or all of his hard work would go to waste. After all, he still wanted to make Ye Chen watch his Master submit to him in front of his eyes.Gu Changge\u2019s words stunned Yan Ji, and the whites in her eyes showed a little red. Compared to Ye Chen\u2019s inability to comprehend the truth, Gu Changge\u2019s remarks deepened the grievance in her heart further.\u201cGu Changge, you fucking bastard! Don\u2019t pretend to be a gentleman now! Do you think I don\u2019t know you and my Master have been plotting against me since the start? Didn\u2019t you only reveal your true faces now because you were waiting for me to open the door of this palace?\u201dYe Chen\u2019s hatred for Gu Changge already towered above the Heavens. His expression was as cold as a glacier, and his killing intent appeared to be liquefying around him.At the same time, he pushed the broken compass in his hands to work faster. As the Key of this inheritance palace, it had the ability to control the formations and traps inside the Secret Realm.With the formations and his own strength, dealing with a mere Gu Changge, who was suppressed to the Great-Transcendent Realm, wouldn\u2019t be a problem. There was a high chance he would come out on the top!\u2018Hoh! He\u2019s not completely stupid.\u2019Gu Changge glanced at Ye Chen, but couldn\u2019t be bothered by his actions.With his expression unchanged, he muttered to himself with a tone full of pity, \u201cYou have such a beautiful Master, yet you keep breaking her heart instead of cherishing her existence!\u201d\u201cBack then, when I tried to win her over, she refused to join me because of you! It\u2019s truly rare to find a woman as wonderful and caring as her.\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t give up on you when you were at your lowest in life, so what could she obtain by plotting against you now?\u201d\u201cNow that you have found a mighty inheritance, and realized that she isn\u2019t all that useful to you, you decided to throw her away?\u201d\u201cAs for your whereabouts? Why don\u2019t you use that brain of yours and think a bit deeply? Why do you think I let you prance around for so long?\u201d\u201cYe Chen, ah, Ye Chen! Tell me, do you not deserve to die after all of this?\u201dGu Changge said with a playful smirk.Swatting Ye Chen to death with a single slap wasn\u2019t as interesting as playing with him slowly and steadily. Breaking hearts before killing was far more fun than simply killing someone.He had mixed the truth with the lies so much that Ye Chen would never be able to tell them apart.\u201cYoung Lord Gu, please don\u2019t say anymore\u2026\u201dYan Ji\u2019s eyes reddened further. She never expected Gu Changge to understand her so well. His words dissipated the chill and sadness in her heart to an extent, and she felt her heart move.Had she followed Young Lord Gu back when he asked her in the dungeon, wouldn\u2019t she not have to suffer such heartbreak today?Maybe, it wasn\u2019t too late for her yet? If Young Lord Gu was okay with it, couldn\u2019t she follow him\u2026now?\u201cGu Changge, shut your damn trap! I never had any intention like that \u2014 you are uttering bullsh!t that has no basis!\u201dYe Chen\u2019s face paled and he couldn\u2019t help but roar out to hide his emotions. Gu Changge\u2019s words were simple, but he had no way to refute him. His words were like a knife stabbing through his heart!Especially, his last sentence about him finding an inheritance and not needing his Master anymore. Did he really think so little of his Master just because she was a remnant spirit?Ye Chen\u2019s head buzzed!That sentence seemed to tear off the fake mask covering his heart. Didn\u2019t he want to keep his Master by his side simply because he desired to possess her?\u201cYoung Lord Gu, if you are alright with Yan Ji, then Yan Ji would like to follow you in the future\u2026\u201dRight then, Yan Ji opened her mouth once more, and the words that rolled off her tongue made Ye Chen\u2019s head almost explode. His face turned green.\u201cB!t\u2026\u201dYe Chen almost cursed out.[Smack!]Gu Changge slapped out before Ye Chen could finish his filthy words. Brilliant runes condensed and turned into a golden, spinning disc that caused Ye Chen to spit out a mouthful of blood.It was still the same as before \u2014 he couldn\u2019t put up a shred of resistance in front of Gu Changge!\u201cYou speak too much.\u201dGu Changge glanced at him with his aloof and indifferent expression, as if he was looking down on an ant from high above.\u201cThis Gu naturally welcomes you if you are willing to follow this Gu, Senior Yan Ji!\u201dGu Changge turned his face towards Yan Ji, and spoke with a smile as gentle as a spring breeze. At the same time, another System Prompt sounded in his mind.[Ding! Yan Ji has changed over to your side! You received 400 Points of Fortune Value and 2000 Destiny Points!]He actually received 400 Points of Fortune Value! This haul wasn\u2019t small.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in his heart; he felt wonderful right now.If someone as foolish as Ye Chen didn\u2019t exist, he would need to spend a lot of time and effort to get someone like Yan Ji on his side. But now, all he needed to do was to add fuel to the fire, and take advantage of the rift that already existed between Yan Ji and Ye Chen.\u201cIf Young Lord Gu is alright with it, then please call me Yan Ji from now on. Senior and whatever doesn\u2019t sound all that appropriate.\u201dYan Ji\u2019s heart was further moved when Gu Changge readily accepted her. She was worried that Gu Changge might not accept her right now.Considering that people of her kind had a lifespan far longer than humans, she wasn\u2019t all that older than him if they converted her age to human age. She felt weird to be called Senior by him.\u201cAlright, I will call you Yan Ji from now on. This is what you said.\u201dGu Changge smiled and gave her the feeling of talking to a graceful Young Lord. At the same time, he took out a piece of crystal clear, radiant jade that he had prepared long ago. Brilliant runes and exhilarating divinity could be felt from the jade.Since he was doing something, then he would obviously make sure to go above and beyond in it\u2019s execution.\u201c[Deity-grade Spirit Nourishing Jade]?\u201dYan Ji immediately recognized the jade in his hands, and exclaimed in shock and amazement, \u201cYoung Lord Gu\u2019s heart is incredibly vast and generous!\u201d\u201cHow can I let you stay in a broken ring?\u201dGu Changge said with a smile. Since he was a rich, handsome, and magnanimous man from the Upper Realm, then he would naturally act like one, too!The preciousness of the [Deity-grade Spirit Nourishing Jade] could be seen just from its name. As for it\u2019s value? It could easily be exchanged for a few Celestial-grade Artifacts.\u201cThank you, Young Lord!\u201dYan Ji\u2019s figure turned into a phantom as she left the ring, and a wisp of red smoke soon entered the [Deity-grade Spirit Nourishing Jade].Her face couldn\u2019t help but turn red as she arrived inside. She had never enjoyed such treatment during her time with Ye Chen.Ye Chen, who was lying on the ground like a beaten dog, felt enraged and frustrated as he watched Gu Changge change his face faster than a man turned a page. He almost went crazy as he listened to the exchange between the two who treated him like thin air.\u201cGu Changge\u2026\u201dYe Chen\u2019s eyes turned completely red. No matter what, he would use the Key of the Secret Realm and fight Gu Changge to death!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Various vein-like rays converged together from all directions, and released an oppressive aura.\u201cI will kill you!\u201dYe Chen roared. His eyes had turned red, and he resembled a ferocious beast who couldn\u2019t wait to devour the world.The Key of the Secret Realm was his trump card. It could control all the formations and mechanisms inside the inheritance palace.He couldn\u2019t bear to watch Gu Changge have an intimate conversation with Yan Ji, who was his Master just a while ago.Gu Changge behaved like he was above the world, and everything he took out was a treasure he (Ye Chen) had never even heard about. He, on the other hand, was like a poor bloke in front of Gu Changge.Ye Chen felt as if he were a beggar watching a prince show off and steal his woman right in front of him!How could Ye Chen bear such humiliation?Worse still? Yan Ji was a peerless beauty whose glamour no one could doubt, and she had personally taught him for many years. Instead of a Master, he treated her as his woman.After all, he was a hot-blooded youth, so it was obvious that he held certain\u00a0\u2018unspeakable\u2019\u00a0emotions towards Yan Ji, his gorgeous Master.Even if Yan Ji had betrayed him, and ended the Master and Disciple relationship between them, he still wouldn\u2019t allow her to throw herself into Gu Changge\u2019s arms so quickly, and right in front of his eyes.\u201cDIE FOR ME!\u201dThe red in his eyes deepened, and his heart burned with flames of jealousy. Right now, he could no longer give a damn about the inheritance or whatever tide of ferocious beasts \u2014 he only cared about killing Gu Changge!He wanted to obliterate this enemy who took everything from him![Boom!]A terrifying aura surged in the palace, as if a savage beast had awakened, and violent rays of light burst out from the ground. These rays of light gathered in the sky, and condensed into a ferocious might ready to obliterate Gu Changge.This was Ye Chen\u2019s mightiest blow, and even existences of the Saint Realm wouldn\u2019t be able to survive after taking a hit.One had to know that no one in this Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm could exert might beyond the Great-Transcendent Realm, and Gu Changge was no exception to this rule. This was Ye Chen\u2019s greatest reliance!\u201cThe Key in Ye Chen\u2019s hand can control the formations and mechanisms in this palace. The power behind them is extremely ferocious, so Young Lord should act with care.\u201dYan Ji reminded Gu Changge to be careful after seeing the scene before her, afraid that he might suffer due to his lack of information.Right now, the way she looked at Ye Chen was completely different. She had already figured everything out \u2014 Ye Chen never regarded her as his Master from the beginning to the end; he had always treated her as his personal possession!Now that the relationship between them was over, she would naturally regard Gu Changge\u2019s enemy as her own enemy, and Ye Chen was one of those now. That was the nature of her race! Once they set their hearts on someone or something, they wouldn\u2019t budge.[VILFIC: in case this wasn\u2019t clear just from the chapter\u2019s content, Yan Ji isn\u2019t a human but from a different race. At least, that\u2019s what I got from the RAWs.]Before, she was Ye Chen\u2019s Master, so she would always help him, and make him increase his cultivation with all her heart. But now, she was on GU Changge\u2019s side, so she would naturally consider whatever was the best for Gu Changge.\u201cThese toys here can\u2019t stop me; Ye Chen can\u2019t make any waves before me!\u201dGu Changge replied with a smile without paying any attention to Ye Chen\u2019s actions. As his words fell, a jet-black Dharma Incarnate[1] appeared behind him. Although it\u2019s cultivation base was limited to the Peak Stage of the Great-Transcendent Realm, it\u2019s aura was nothing short of a mighty Ancient God\u2019s![1: something like an illusory Spiritual Puppet that can fight for you.]As Gu Changge threw a fist, the jet-black Dharma Incarnate behind him also threw a fist! Immediately, a terrifying might erupted, and the void around the rumbled.[Puff!]The condensed blow of light made of runes and patterns slammed towards Gu Changge, but his Dharma Incarnate\u2019s punch obliterated it! All the patterns and runes vanished into thin smoke without a trace.His fearsome punch shocked Yan Ji. She realized that she had sorely underestimated Gu Changge\u2019s strength. How could he, the Young Lord of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, be similar to ordinary people with ordinary means?\u201cHow is this possible\u2026\u201dA powerful backlash hit Ye Chen, and he spewed a mouthful of blood with a loud scream. At the same time, he flew back like a broken kite, covered in blood.He couldn\u2019t believe the outcome!The power he summoned using the inheritance palace\u2019s Key, formations, and all mechanisms was smashed to smithereens with a single punch from a mere Dharma Incarnate!What\u2019s more? He wasn\u2019t even going all out, and the might he used was still under the limitations set by the Secret Realm, yet it obliterated his trump card with a single punch.[Kacha! Crack!]What gave Ye Chen a deeper shock was the fact that the dilapidated compass in his hands showed many cracks, and then shattered!That was to say:\u00a0\u2018he would have already turned into meat paste if the Key of the inheritance palace hadn\u2019t blocked most of Gu Changge\u2019s might!\u2019Chills went down Ye Chen\u2019s back as this realization hit him.Gu Changge\u2019s true strength was far beyond his imagination. Even though he was suppressed to the Great-Transcendent Realm, Ye Chen estimated that he could still easily slaughter Saint Realm cultivators with a few swats.Ye Chen\u2019s heart froze in shock, and he couldn\u2019t help but shiver and stand rooted to his spot.\u201cYou have played around enough, and now is the time for you to go off to the next world, Little Leek\u2026\u201dGu Changge casually dictated his fate.[Hum!]Gu Changge slapped out again, and the Dharma Incarnate behind him followed with a slap of its own that expanded and obscured everything in front of him (Ye Chen)! The void rumbled, and his expression showed clear indifference as if he was a god who could crush anything and everything.\u201cImpossible! How can I possibly die here\u2026\u201dDespair clouded Ye Chen\u2019s eyes, and shivers went down his spine as he watched the palm get bigger and bigger. Right now, he couldn\u2019t even move as the oppressive might heading towards him had already suppressed him.He had always believed himself to be a mighty youth, but before Gu Changge\u2019s palm, he found himself to be as small as an ant that had no ability to resist!He was going to die today!All of his trump cards and tricks had failed in the face of absolute strength!\u201cStop! Gu Changge!\u201dRight at this moment, a cold cry arrived from the outside.Somehow, Ye Liuli broke away from the tide of beasts and rushed over to this place just in time to see Gu Changge slapping out to squash Ye Chen to death.[Shua!]An extremely splendid sword light containing wisps of sharp sword intent slashed out, to sever everything in its past!She wanted to save Ye Chen at all costs!Ye Liuli was in the Saint Realm. Although she was suppressed at the Great-Transcendent Realm in the Secret Realm, her combat power of the Great-Transcendent Realm was stronger than ordinary cultivators. She was sure she could stop Gu Changge.[Puff!]However, she was shocked to see that her sword was like a ball of mud sinking into the sea when it slashed at the pitch-black hand of Gu Changge\u2019s Dharma Incarnate!\u2018How is this possible\u2026\u2019\u2018My Realm is no different from Gu Changge\u2019s, so why can\u2019t I even cut off his Dharma Incarnate\u2019s hand\u2026\u2019Disbelief filled Ye Liuli\u2019s eyes.Her snow-white long sword wasn\u2019t made of some run-of-the-mill materials either. It was crafted with Divine Gold, and her swordsmanship technique was the Ancient Immortal Ye Clan\u2019s extremely mighty Sword Art that was commended even in the Upper Realm.She could easily obliterate Saint Realm cultivators with a single slash of her sword, but Gu Changge didn\u2019t even budge at her attack!\u201cYou arrived right at time.\u201dGu Changge watched her with a playful expression. Then, he changed his slapping motion to a grabbing one, and his Dharma Incarnate\u2019s hand directly grabbed Ye Chen and raised him in the air.It was as if he was holding onto a bug!\u201cLiuli\u2026\u201dYe Chen\u2019s face paled inside the suffocating hold, and eh couldn\u2019t help but call out to Ye Liuli while struggling desperately for freedom. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t get away.This was the might of Gu Changge\u2019s [Myriad Changes Demonic Physique]. Let alone the current Ye Chen, even if he was allowed to break through to another Great Realm, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to break free from Gu Changge\u2019s hold.Ye Chen knew well that only Ye Liuli could save him now.[Cough! Puff!]Unfortunately, as soon as he opened his mouth, Gu Changge tightened his hold around him. Ye Chen couldn\u2019t help but spew even more blood and struggle harder for freedom.Yan Ji watched everything with a calm expression, without a shred of sympathy for Ye Chen.He had brought this upon himself.She had advised him to give up on his revenge and hatred, but he never listened to her. He was reaping the fruit of his own stubbornness and ego!\u201cWhat is it? Do you want to save him?\u201dGu Changge gazed at Ye Liuli with a light smile. He wasn\u2019t surprised to see her arrive here so fast even when there were so many demons attacking her. After all, she was the little princess of the Ancient Immortal Ye Clan, so she must have a lot of techniques and treasures on her that could easily solve a bunch of weak beasts like those in a flash.Of course, the most important thing is that Gu Changge was sure she would arrive here in the nick of time somehow.With Ye Chen in his grasp, he could make good use of her and squeeze out the final Fortune Value on this fat leek.\u201cGu Changge, stop this instant, and let Brother Ye Chen go! Just say what you want in return\u2026\u201dYe Liuli uttered with a frosty tone. Gu Changge\u2019s expression showed her that he had a plan for her, but it was impossible for her to watch her Brother Ye Chen die right before her eyes.From what she knew of Gu Changge\u2019s character, he would most likely threaten her with Ye Chen\u2019s life and ask for something. Alas! Gu Changge was too strong for her, so she couldn\u2019t deal with him using normal means.At first, she had some hope for her Brother Ye Chen, and thought that she should also put her trust in him since he was so confident\u2026she had never thought she would watch her Brother Ye Chen almost get slapped to death by Gu Changge the moment she arrived.Ye Liuli had no idea on how to resolve this issue.\u201cCan I ask for anything?\u201dAn expression of intrigue appeared on Gu Changge\u2019s face, and he asked back.Ye Liuli glared daggers at him, and replied, \u201cI am willing to do anything as long as you spare Brother Ye Chen! Of course, your request mustn\u2019t be too excessive\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, wait, wait! Right now, you are the one begging me, and not the other way around, so who are you to decide the conditions?\u201dGu Changge raised his eyebrows and interrupted her speech, still with an expression of indifference on his face.\u201cIf you don\u2019t even understand this much, then don\u2019t even think about saving Ye Chen.\u201dAs his words fell, a smile appeared on his handsome visage, accentuating his charm. At the same time, the hand of his Dharma Incarnate clenched even tighter. Ye Chen spewed another mouthful of blood, but his face showed an unyielding expression of hatred and rage.Gu Changge\u2019s handsome, gentlemanly appearance fell into Ye Liuli\u2019s eyes, but to her, he was no different from a fierce devil, so her expression turned even colder.\u201cLiuli, don\u2019t listen to him! I won\u2019t let you beg him even if I have to die!\u201dYe Chen decided to show some backbone at this time, and glared at Gu Changge with an unyielding expression. It was as if he was telling Gu Changge that he would tear off a piece of his flesh even if he died today!\u201cDid I allow you to speak?\u201dGu Changge glanced at him with an indifferent expression.[Puff!]Ye Chen spewed blood as he was crushed again \u2014 he felt suffocated!\u201cJust say what you want to let Brother Ye Chen go? I will do it as long as it\u2019s within my ability.\u201dYe Liuli glared daggers at Gu Changge, and spoke with a stubborn tone.\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. You merely need to open your Sea of Consciousness and let me imprint a Slave Seal inside.\u201dGu Changge\u2019s expression remained unchanged, and he uttered his remark as if it was something minor.But, as soon as Ye Chen heard his words, his expression fell. Once a Slave Seal was imprinted in someone\u2019s Sea of Consciousness, they would end up as a slave for the rest of their life, and would never be able to go against the one who imprinted the Seal.The price was simply too high!Would Ye Liuli even agree? He was at a loss for words, and a hint of struggle appeared in his expression\u2026\u201cLiuli, don\u2019t accept his condition! I would rather die\u2026\u201dYe Chen couldn\u2019t help but scream loudly. Obviously, he didn\u2019t want to die! He wanted revenge, so he couldn\u2019t die here no matter what.And to survive, he knew that he couldn\u2019t show his fear of death and greed for life, or Ye Liuli might hesitate in saving him. Ye Chen didn\u2019t really want to trick Ye Liuli like this, but he knew he wouldn\u2019t survive otherwise.Gu Changge would most definitely kill him.He was in great pain, and didn\u2019t know why he ended up in such dire straits today. All of this was Gu Changge\u2019s fault!\u201cImprint a Slave Seal? Gu Changge, you are truly audacious! But, alright, I am willing to let you do it if it can save Brother Ye Chen\u2019s life.\u201dYe Liuli was relieved when she heard Gu Changge\u2019s words. On the surface, she showed an extremely enraged and unwilling expression, and even quietened down for a moment before taking in a deep breath and agreeing to his proposition.She believed that her act could deceive Gu Changge. After all, her Ancient Immortal Ye Clan was a primordial heritage that was well-versed in countering Seals and Arts of even primordial gods. Slave Seals were their specialty, and only the Ancient Immortal Ye Clan\u2019s direct descendants knew about this secret.Even if Gu Changge had calculated everything, he mustn\u2019t have thought this one through. She had a way to get rid of the Slave Seal!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just when she was thinking on how to solve this issue, Gu Changge asked her to open her Sea of Consciousness and let him imprint a Slave Seal inside.She was enraged the moment she heard his words, but then she remembered that a mere Slave Seal was nothing before her Ancient Immortal Ye Clan.To make sure Gu Changge couldn\u2019t guess anything from her expressions, she put on a show of unwillingness and struggle in front of him. After all, to hide something from someone as cunning as Gu Changge, one had to think deeply and put in effort.Ye Chen\u2019s heart moved when he heard Ye Liuli\u2019s words, and he felt guilty. Just now, because of his fear of death, he had deliberately pretended to be an unyielding man to deceive her.After he planted the Slave Seal in her Sea of Consciousness, won\u2019t Ye Liuli end up as Gu Changge\u2019s possession? Ye Chen felt extreme discomfort and pain in his heart when he thought about this.He didn\u2019t want to see something like that happen, but he had no choice. After all, who would want to see their affectionate, childhood sweetheart-cum-cousin become a slave of their enemy? Unless, of course, if they had something wrong with their brain\u2026\u201cHoh! I am surprised to see you agree so readily. To think the little princess of the Ancient Immortal Ye Clan would surrender her Sea of Consciousness and willingly become a slave for someone as pathetic as this Ye Chen\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I were your father, I might have slapped you to death already.\u201dGu Changge mocked with a casual smile, and didn\u2019t show any signs of wanting to let go of Ye Chen.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about those matters. I promise to open my Sea of Consciousness for your Slave Seal, but you must also take a Heavenly Oath that you won\u2019t try to hunt or kill Brother Ye Chen. If you violate this Oath, the Devil will devour your heart and your cultivation will be destroyed!\u201dYe Liuli glared at Gu Changge and made it clear to him that she will only open her Sea of Consciousness after he took the Heavenly Oath. There was no way she would back down even an inch on this requirement \u2014 who knew what other tricks this Gu Changge might have up his sleeves?After all, the Sea of Consciousness was the source of a cultivator\u2019s existence. One could rebuild a shattered Dantian, but a messed up Sea of Consciousness could easily spell their doom.What\u2019s more? The Sea of Consciousness was also the place where all of a cultivator\u2019s secrets (thoughts and memories) were hidden. Opening one\u2019s Sea of Consciousness and letting someone inside was the same as giving them complete knowledge of your deepest secrets.Ye Liuli had no choice but to resort to this. It was impossible for her to watch Ye Chen die at Gu Changge\u2019s hands right in front of her.\u201cYou want me to take a Heavenly Oath? Alright.\u201dGu Changge\u2019s expression showed no change, and he readily repeated Ye Liuli\u2019s words of Oath, \u201c\u2026 If I violate this Oath, may my heart be devoured by the Devil, and all of my cultivation be obliterated!\u201dEverything was going far too well. Ye Liuli couldn\u2019t help but frown as she couldn\u2019t figure out what was going through Gu Changge\u2019s mind.She felt disturbed, and wondered if she was simply thinking too much?Could someone as sinister and cunning as Gu Changge really fall for her tricks so easily?\u201cI have already taken the Heavenly Oath, so shouldn\u2019t you be opening your Sea of Consciousness right about now?\u201dGu Changge asked with a faint tone, and his expression appeared to be sincere without any hidden meaning. Ye Liuli couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with his words and actions.Gritting her teeth, she closed her eyes and opened her Sea of Consciousness for him.[Hum!]Immediately, a pitch-black light flashed past Gu Changge\u2019s pupils, and turned into a demonic [Great Dao Treasured Bottle]. Like a brilliant rune, the [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] moved through the void and plunged into the depths of Ye Liuli\u2019s Sea of Consciousness.It was so quick that she didn\u2019t even have a chance to respond.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dYe Liuli frowned due to a strange feeling, but she couldn\u2019t tell where that feeling came from? Had he already imprinted the Slave Seal? How come she didn\u2019t see Gu Changge do anything?What kind of sorcery was this? She couldn\u2019t feel the slightest shackle or seal inside her Sea of Consciousness, and questioned if he had even imprinted his Slave Seal in there?Also, why did she feel as if she desired to surrender herself to Gu Changge? The sudden feeling left Ye Liuli in a fluster, and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she had fallen in love or something?\u201cIt\u2019s naturally the promised Slave Seal.\u201dRight then, a strange smile appeared on Gu Changge\u2019s face as he spoke.Ye Liuli frowned in response, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I feel anything then?\u201dGu Changge stared at her with a smile, and asked, \u201cTell me how you would like to feel?\u201dYe Liuli\u2019s heart sank and her face showed an ugly expression. She didn\u2019t speak anymore. Matters had devolved far beyond her control.Could it be that she could no longer hate Gu Changge?Although creating that [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] wasn\u2019t easy for Gu Changge, he didn\u2019t think using it on Ye Liuli was a waste.It was the Secret Art used to control people recorded in the forbidden inheritance of the [Immortal-Devouring Demon Art].It\u2019s just that after it fell into Gu Changge\u2019s hands, it ended up even more terrifying than before. He directly condensed the Secret Art\u2019s power into a rune that resembled a [Great Dao Treasured Bottle].Although the process to create it was troublesome, the [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] that came out was far better than the original, and it couldn\u2019t even be discovered when used. He could directly plant it inside the other party\u2019s Sea of Consciousness without them feeling anything, as long as they willing opened their Sea of Consciousness before him.As for a Slave Seal? Those were merely low-leveled trash.Gu Changge\u2019s [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] was hundreds of times better than a Slave Seal, so much so that they couldn\u2019t even be compared.As for why he used it? There was no way Gu Changge couldn\u2019t guess Ye Liuli\u2019s sneaky plot. After all, the Ancient Immortal Ye Clan was a behemoth in the Upper Realm. Getting rid of a measly Slave Seal wouldn\u2019t be all that hard for them.He naturally called it a Slave Seal to fool Ye Liuli.She thought she was smart, but in Gu Changge\u2019s eyes, she was a naive thing that overestimated its wit.\u2018Now that the mind-controlling demonic bottle is inside her Sea of Consciousness, it won\u2019t be long before she forgets about today\u2019s incident. Unless a peerless powerhouse looks through her Sea of Consciousness, or something else goes wrong, there will be no way someone would find it\u2026\u2019\u2018Over time, she will become nothing more than a submissive slave of mine.\u2019Satisfaction filled Gu Changge\u2019s heart as he thought about this. When he did some calculations, he realized that he had earned a lot today!\u201cGu Changge, you should release Brother Ye Chen now, right?\u201dYe Liuli said with a glare targeted at Gu Changge. The fact that she couldn\u2019t feel the existence of the Slave Seal brought deep unease to her heart.\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201dGu Changge glared back at her.Ye Liuli felt her head buzz, and thought that her mind was about to explode. She was left in a trance, and felt as if an ancient god was looking down on her. With a deep fear clawing at her heart, she uttered involuntarily, \u201cMaster\u2026\u201dYe Liuli was stunned as soon as the word rolled off her tongue, and wondered why she had suddenly uttered that when she didn\u2019t even intend to?She was left stupefied.\u201cGu Changge, what did you do to Liuli?!\u201dYe Chen\u2019s anxiety deepened, and his face paled further, as he saw the scene in front of him. He couldn\u2019t believe what his eyes were seeing! Did his beloved cousin really call Gu Changge her Master?What was going on?His head buzzed, and he couldn\u2019t accept this reality.\u201cYou are about to die, but your bullsh!t won\u2019t stop.\u201dGu Changge gave Ye Chen a dismissive glance. The System had already informed him in his mind that Ye Chen\u2019s Fortune Value had been cleared. He could now kill him and obtain a Heavenly Reward![Creak! Puff!]Gu Changge didn\u2019t wait anymore, and the palm of his Dharma Incarnate tightened its hold around Ye Chen.\u201cLiuli, save me\u2026\u201dYe Chen\u2019s eyes widened in panic, despair, and disbelief as Gu Changge crushed him to death. He didn\u2019t even know when he died, and couldn\u2019t understand how Gu Changge could do it?Was Gu Changge not afraid of receiving the Heavenly Oath\u2019s backlash by killing him? Was he not afraid of having his heart devoured by a Devil? Was he not afraid of having all his cultivation destroyed?Of course, Gu Changge didn\u2019t give a damn about some bullsh!t Oath. What nonsense was that? Wasn\u2019t it just sending him nourishment?As for losing his cultivation? He couldn\u2019t give one damn about that \u2014 he could always use Destiny Points to get it back.After all, how could he let such a fat Favored Son of Heaven fly away from his plate right in front of his eyes? How could he let go of the Heavenly Rewards he would gain from devouring him?Won\u2019t all of his hard work over such a long time go to waste?Gu Changge would never accept such a loss.\u201cGu Changge, you\u2026\u201dYe Liuli was stunned by the scene in front of her, and couldn\u2019t regain her senses for a while. She had trusted his Oath, yet he went back on his words immediately afterwards!She didn\u2019t even know how to curse Gu Changge\u2019s shamelessness.\u2018I must avenge Brother Ye Chen\u2026\u2019Ye Liuli\u2019s consciousness blanked as this thought crossed her mind, and she realized that she couldn\u2019t muster any killing intent towards Gu Changge.It had to be the work of that Slave Seal he planted in her Sea of Consciousness just now!Ye Liuli\u2019s heart chilled, and she felt deep fear. She couldn\u2019t control her own actions and thoughts, even though she knew there was something wrong with her.As for Yan Ji? She had nothing to say even though she watched everything transpire. Gu Changge now appeared even more heroic in her eyes. After all, breaking a mere Heavenly Oath was nothing big if one\u2019s aspirations were grand enough!Besides, Ye Chen was already intent on killing Gu Changge. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to persuade Gu Changge to let Ye Chen off after knowing all that.Naturally, Gu Changge didn\u2019t give a hoot about Ye Liuli\u2019s opinion of him. Since his demonic bottle was already inside her Sea of Consciousness, her thoughts about him no longer mattered.Right then, a System Prompt rang in his mind.[Ding! You have killed the Favored Son of Heaven, Ye Chen, and triggered extra Heavenly Rewards by clearing all of his Fortune Value in the process! Reward calculations are in progress\u2026][Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received a Heavenly Dao Reward Chest, 200 Points of Fortune Value, and 1000 Destiny Points!]\u2018Use [System\u2019s Reward Calculations Multiplication Card]!\u2019Gu Changge commanded after taking out the item from the System\u2019s Warehouse. This happened to be a good time to use the [System\u2019s Reward Calculations Multiplication Card].[Ding! System\u2019s Reward Calculations Multiplication Card used successfully! Congratulations, Host! Your reward has been increased by five times!][Ding! The current rewards have automatically been multiplied\u2026][Ding! After the final calculation, your reward has been increased to 1000 Points of Fortune Value and 5000 Destiny Points!]\u2018Open the Heavenly Dao Reward Chest!\u2019Gu Changge said in his mind.He wanted to know what kind of stuff will come out this time. The last time, he received the Villain\u2019s Halo, and that helped him solve the issue of Fortune Backlash due to a disparity in his and the Favored Children\u2019s strength.What will he receive this time?He looked forward to the rewards.With a flash of golden light, a golden chest appeared in front of his eyes and then exploded with a bang![Ding! Congratulations, Host, for having great fortune! You have received: One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x1 | Void Essence x1!]Gu Changge slightly raised his eyebrows. He had received another [One-Third Fragment of a World Seed], and collected all three, so he should be able to refine it and nourish a world inside his body.As for the [Void Essence]? He wondered about it\u2019s utility.Gu Changge immediately checked its introduction, and his eyes couldn\u2019t help but light up.\u2018The Void Essence comes from the Void Physique that contains the power to control the Void however it pleases\u2026\u2019\u2018Sure enough, it\u2019s good stuff. At least, it\u2019s much better than that whatever [God King\u2019s Heart] from last time.\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but praise the reward, and directly chose to absorb it. A feeling of warmth surged through his body, and the boundless power of the Void filled his bones and limbs.This process didn\u2019t last long, and Gu Changge soon opened his eyes. Immediately, he felt that he and the Void around him had a certain resonance between them.The power of the Void \u2014 it can allow one to attack, defend, and escape!After that, Gu Changge called out for his Attribute Panel. His Fortune Value and Destiny points had sky-rocketed after this massive haul.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The leek he raised for so long brought him a fat harvest just like he desired.He now had almost ten thousand Destiny Points, and close to two thousand Points of Fortune Value. In addition to these, he also got other haul.He could now do a lot more, and put many of his plans into action. Of course, the most important matter right now was for him to fulfill his purpose behind descending to the Lower Realm.Ye Chen had already cleared the path for him, and the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] was his to take now!As for the inheritance of Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm? It didn\u2019t matter to Gu Changge all that much. Only a minor character like Ye Chen would care about a Quasi-Supreme\u2019s inheritance. As a Young Lord from a prominent family in the Upper Realm, he didn\u2019t lack inheritances of mighty beings. What\u2019s more? He also had the System to jack him up!\u2018According to the description of the Heavenly Rewards, the Void Essence should be related to Ye Chen[1]. Did that Ye Chen have some latent Physique or some other Mystical Talent?\u2019\u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t matter now even if he did!\u2019[1: The Heavenly Reward Chest gives a random thing + something related to the Favored Child of Heaven killed by Gu Changge.]Gu Changge thought about it and then dismissed the matter. After that, he felt his current control over the Void. Not only could this new ability help him fight against others, but it could also help him escape and hide when he might be in dire straits.After all, the power to control the Void was the power to control Space itself. Not many forces had studied it even in the Upper Realm. All the Mystical Abilities related to Space were extremely mysterious and mighty.Gu Changge could use this ability as one of his minor trump cards.\u2018I should keep the World Seed\u2019s fragments for now, and refine them later when I have time. I should have more means to successfully refine and nourish a world inside my body at that time\u2026\u2019Gu Changge decided in his mind, and then swept his gaze across the palace\u2019s hall. A light of satisfaction appeared in his eyes when his gaze landed on the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]. It was the reason behind his descent to the Lower Realm, after all.The ferocious Devil Qi coming out from the Halberd stirred his Devil Heart, and he felt a deep connection to between his Origin and the Halberd. Gu Changge couldn\u2019t suppress his desire to possess this supreme, evil weapon.Once he obtained the weapon, he would have another trump card to rely on when he returned to the Upper Realm; he wouldn\u2019t need to spend so much effort on schemes and underhanded means.\u201cGu Changge, what did you do to me?\u201dYe Liuli\u2019s roar sounded from the side, and interrupted Gu Changge\u2019s thoughts on how he could obtain the Halberd as soon as possible. She was struggling with an extremely complicated expression on her face. Confusion, rage, and coldness masked her face, but if there was one thing missing, then that would be hatred.She knew that she should have hatred for him, but for some reason, whenever she thought about hating Gu Changge, a deep fear would grip her heart as if she was facing a Heavenly Tribulation!This feeling put her through extreme pain and struggle.This was definitely because of Gu Changge\u2019s sorcery! She regretted her actions, and wondered why she was dumb enough to think she could outwit Gu Changge and play him? In the end, Gu Changge played her, and she was merely dancing in the palm of his hand.\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201dGu Changge glanced at her with a playful smirk.To be honest, he wasn\u2019t all that interested in Ye Liuli. The only reason he bothered with her was her identity. As the little princess of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, she was the one most favored by their Patriarch. As long as he used her well, he could get a lot of benefits from the Ancient Immortal Ye Family with his identity as the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.Why else would he bother keeping Ye Liuli?Ye Liuli\u2019s head buzzed again at Gu Changge\u2019s words full of indifference. The previous daze took over her again, and she felt as if she was standing before an ancient god as Gu Changge\u2019s indifferent eyes kept staring at her.Her very soul trembled, and she couldn\u2019t help but submit herself before him.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201dYe Liuli felt great humiliation as the word left her mouth, and tears welled up in her eyes. He was the enemy who had murdered her Brother Ye Chen, yet here she was, calling him\u00a0\u2018Master.\u2019She couldn\u2019t bear this shame, but she had no way to stop herself.Ye Liuli wanted the earth to explode and swallow her whole. She had only suffered humiliation and setbacks ever since she met Gu Changge! Nothing good had come out from her encounter with him.\u2018Young Lord\u2019s thoughts and means are completely beyond Ye Chen\u2019s. Ye Chen would have never made a comeback, or have had his revenge, against Young Lord Gu in this life!\u2019Yan Ji couldn\u2019t help but think this in her heart after watching everything that transpired. Then, her figure turned into a wisp of light and she returned inside the [Deity-grade Spirit Nourishing Jade].The [Divine-grade Spirit Nourishing Jade] was incomparably more precious and beneficial to her, compared to some ordinary ring. Not only did it kept her remnant spirit warm, but it also nourished it and strengthened her Primordial Spirit. Even for God Kings, it was a treasure that they would keep close to their person at all times.It\u2019s just that Gu Changge put multiple layers of shackles and restrictions on the [Spirit Nourishing Jade]. Yan Ji couldn\u2019t spy on the outside world through the Jade, unless he allowed it.After all, he hated the fact that all these\u00a0\u2018Grandpas\u2019\u00a0had the ability to watch everything that went on the outside world. They would watch the Protagonists at all times, and the Protagonists would have no privacy or secrets.Gu Changge made sure to make the restrictions as watertight as possible, and took into consideration every aspect. Yan Ji knew this, but she wasn\u2019t bothered by the restrictions. After all, she wasn\u2019t someone who liked to spy on someone else\u2019s secrets.What\u2019s more? Someone with Gu Changge\u2019s identity would most certainly have many secrets. It was reasonable for Gu Changge to do this much, and she also didn\u2019t want Gu Changge to have any suspicion towards her.What\u2019s more? The [Deity-grade Spirit Nourishing Jade] wasn\u2019t a prison. As long as she willed, she could leave it at any time and show up in the outside world.This further moved Yan Ji\u2019s heart as Gu Changge had put a lot of thought and care into giving her a comfortable and leisurely environment with complete freedom. This was treatment that she would never receive from Ye Chen!She immediately sat inside the Jade and started to strengthen her spirit.In the ring, she could only float around in a dazd, with nothing to do. But now, she could use the powers of the Jade to nourish and cultivate her remnant spirit. The two treatments were as different as Heaven and Earth, and only when one experienced both for themselves, would they understand their disparity.\u2018To be able to so-easily pierce the body of a Quasi-Supreme, and bring chaos to all the worlds, this [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] must be a Supreme-grade Artifact, or higher\u2026\u201d\u2018It seems I will need to use some tricks to possess it\u2026\u2019\u2018I wonder if I can refine it by simply using Destiny Points\u2026after all, Destiny Points can increase cultivation base and comprehension, so this shouldn\u2019t be impossible either\u2026\u2019Gu Changge was already thinking up of plans to conquer the Halberd when he walked further into the palace.[Boom!]A terrifying pressure that could shake one\u2019s very soul descended upon him, giving him a feeling of an ancient god looking down on him, but Gu Changge completely ignored it.The [Innate God\u2019s Temple] in his Sea of Consciousness reverberated, and the gaze of the shadowy figure inside it cut through the void to stare at whatever stood before him![Hum!]An even stronger pressure descended upon him, and Gu Changge wondered if it was the aura left behind by the creator of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm before his death, or the might of the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]? Either way, he felt as if the aura could obliterate the Heavens!Gu Changge\u2019s Devil Heart surged at this moment, and a pitch-black, demonic shadow appeared behind him as his devilish nature unleashed itself.Ghostly knells and chants sounded from all the corners of the world, as if the devils everywhere were welcoming their Lord! The origin of his aura resonated with the Devil Qi in the surroundings, and the pressure of the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] pressing down on him disappeared to a great extent.This relaxed Gu Changge, and he appeared at the core of the palace within a few steps.[Hum!]Right at this moment, however, sudden change occured. The body that was pierced by the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd], and nailed to the palace\u2019s throne, suddenly trembled and released terrifying fluctuations in the surroundings.A ray of brilliant light shone around the body, and a silhouette appeared above it, as if the corpse was about to resurrect.\u201cIt turns out that the inheritance was left behind like this. It\u2019s good that I killed Ye Chen first, or I would be in some trouble\u2026\u201dGu Changge frowned and stopped in his tracks.Anyone could tell that there was something wrong with this place. Normally, there were only two possibilities for a millenniums-old corpse\u2019s resurrection:\u00a0\u2018One is that the corpse isn\u2019t a corpse, or there\u2019s a remnant spirit left behind to pass on the inheritance.\u2019No matter which one the case was for this Quasi-Supreme, it spelled danger for Gu Changge.He hadn\u2019t come here to accept the inheritance, instead, he was here to refine and bring away the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]. In other words, he was here to destroy the seal set by the Secret Realm\u2019s owner.Since the Secret Realm\u2019s owner still had a remnant spirit left, how could he allow him to do as he pleased?It didn\u2019t take long for Gu Changge to figure all of this out.According to the normal plot progression, the Favored Son of Heaven would obviously reach this point easily, and get the approval of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm\u2019s master. He would then receive the inheritance, become a champion of justice, and tighten the seal of the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd].But now, not only did he pick the fruit of the Favored Son\u2019s hard work, but he also killed off the Favored Son of Heaven.Gu Changge had no interest in the Fortuitous Encounter left for the Favored Son of Heaven, especially when there was danger associated with it.\u201cCome to me and learn my Dao\u2026\u201dRight then, the silhouette above the corpse turned real, and brought along a majestic pressure with it. Wearing a purple-gold crown and golden divine robes, he looked like an ancient emperor.His gaze fell upon Gu Changge and he commanded.As a Quasi-Supreme, he was naturally the absolute master of the Secret Realm with complete control over everything. All kinds of thoughts flashed past Gu Changge\u2019s mind as he watched the remnant spirit in front of him.If things got dangerous, he could still escape from the Secret Realm, but then he would lose the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd].\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter since I have the [Domain Traversing Talisman]. If things turn for the worse, then I can use it and get away\u2026\u2019Gu Changge\u2019s expression turned calm, and he quickly thought of a solution in his heart. At the same time, his Devil Heart\u2019s power subsided and disappeared.\u201cYes, senior!\u201dWith a calm expression, he walked towards the corpse. The Master of the Secret Realm should have been a decent man when alive, so Gu Changge wasn\u2019t worried about him using any tricks, or attacking him out of nowhere.\u201cYou have a demonic heart and a devilish nature\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can I pass on my Dao of Light to you?\u201dJust when Gu Changge stood still, a gleam flashed past the remnant spirit\u2019s eyes, and he stared deeply at Gu Changge. After that, his terrifying voice full of rage almost shattered the palace, and Gu Changge felt his blood rumble.Fortunately, he was already prepared and protecting his vitals, or the sudden tremors would have shocked him into a stupor. After all, the remnant spirit belonged to a Quasi-Supreme, so it wouldn\u2019t be easy for him to deal with it immediately.At the same time, this verified Gu Changge\u2019s speculation.This remnant spirit had its own consciousness and wasn\u2019t just an inanimate recording left behind by the Secret Realm\u2019s master. Fortunately, he had already restrained his Devil Heart, or the remnant spirit might have already attacked him, instead of conversing with him like this.At that time, it would have definitely tried to slap him to death. After all, the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd], and the one who killed this Quasi-Supreme, were related to him and his inheritance\u2019s origin.\u2018That bastard Ye Chen\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t all that clean either. Not only did he covet his Master\u2019s body, but he was also a jealous and hypocritical piece of crap. He even feared death to the point of pretending to be unyielding and mighty\u2026\u2019\u2018So he\u2019s deserving just because he is the Favored Son of Heaven? Isn\u2019t this rigged too much?\u2019Gu Changge was left speechless, and felt immense dissatisfaction towards the judgement ability of the Secret Realm\u2019s master.Sure enough, he only held malice towards him. Alas! He was a villain, and just his existence was enough to offend these people.\u201cSenior, although this junior has a devilish nature, my heart is bright, and full of justice for the world. I intend to help the common people, and bring light to the life of those drowned in darkness\u2026\u201d\u201cIf the Senior\u2019s inheritance is given to this junior, then this junior guarantees to punish evil, promote justice, and never stray from the correct path!\u201dBut, since it was a remnant spirit, it shouldn\u2019t be all that hard for him to deal with it. After he dealt with this remnant spirit, he will naturally be able to conquer the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd].Gu Changge\u2019s face showed an expression of righteous, and he couldn\u2019t help but utter eloquent words full of justice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He will help the common people, and bring light to the life of those drowned in darkness?Ye Liuli couldn\u2019t help but feel ashamed at Gu Changge\u2019s shameless claims, when she heard his spiel from the outside. Listening to Gu Changge make all these claims was nothing short of listening to a wolf claiming to be a vegetarian! It was too embarrassing.Gu Changge\u2019s expression, however, truly made him look like a champion of justice. Those who weren\u2019t familiar with his true face would really think he was a great man.His act was flawless!\u201cThe sun and the moon can testify that this young one\u2019s heart is truly filled with kindness, and the world can bear witness\u2026\u201dInside the hall, Gu Changge said to the remnant spirit with a face full of righteousness \u2014 he wanted to see if he could fool this ancient remnant spirit somehow. He could still consider other options if his act didn\u2019t work, since he wasn\u2019t lacking in plans.Speaking of which, it seemed that the remnant spirit\u2019s mind wasn\u2019t all that sharp, as it fell into deep thought after listening to Gu Changge\u2019s words. This gave rise to other thoughts and ideas in Gu Changge\u2019s mind. After all, the one in front of him was a Quasi-Supreme\u2019s remnant spirit, so it must have some Quasi-Supreme Essence that he could devour.If he could swallow his Essence with his [Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art], he might just break through to another Realm. Although he could always raise his cultivation by adding Destiny Points, he wouldn\u2019t be dumb enough to miss such a good opportunity delivered to his door just because of that.After all, the cultivation method for his [Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art] was completely different from the [Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex]. One relied on devouring the origin of beings and everything else, while the other relied on him comprehending or adding Destiny Points for an upgrade.Gu Changge\u2019s body had always held two different powers, and both of them had completely different cultivation methods. It was all thanks to his Devil Heart that he could tolerate their existence \u2014 ordinary cultivators would immediately get ravaged by the chaotic repelling forces when trying to cultivate more than one method, go crazy, and die off not too long after.Gu Changge\u2019s apparent cultivation base naturally came from the [Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex], while the cultivation base from his [Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art] was always hidden, and never revealed before anyone else in the world.He had always wanted to raise his cultivation of the [Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art], but that had been impossible since it could only be raised through devouring existences.It was always better to have more powerful Mystical Abilities and Treasures, as that could help him exert greater strength and come out on top at a critical moment. The [Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art] wasn\u2019t a cultivation method, after all, but something that directly raised his cultivation.[VILFIC: cultivation methods are manuals that tell you how to absorb Spiritual Qi, move it around your body, and then raise your cultivation through meditation. IDDA is an art that doesn\u2019t have any specific manual, and instead directly absorbs other people\u2019s cultivation to raise your own.]Although Gu Changge was thinking of this sinister plot in his heart, his expression said otherwise.\u201cSHAMELESS JUNIOR!\u201d\u201cHow dare you lie to me and covet my inheritance?! Did you think you could cover your true thoughts and schemes before my eyes?\u201dThe remnant spirit\u2019s mighty voice fell, and the Void in the surroundings trembled together with surging Spiritual Qi.Wearing a purple-gold crown and divine golden robes, the remnant spirit of the Quasi-Supreme resembled an ancient, mighty emperor. At the same time, a dazzling brilliance shone in his eyes.He glared at Gu Changge, and shouted at him in extreme rage \u2014 Gu Changge\u2019s words couldn\u2019t fool him, and his evil plot was revealed in front of him. He might just be a remnant spirit of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm\u2019s master, but it didn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t have some of the original\u2019s divinity! He could naturally see through Gu Changge\u2019s true thoughts.Not only did the brat in front of him have a devilish heart, but he also plotted to trick him! This enraged him beyond measure.\u201cJunior, you deserve death for your audacity! How dare you think about deceiving me? Ever sentence that comes out of your mouth is a lie, and your heart has no sincerity! You better shut your damn trap!\u201dHe passed his judgement with a cold tone, and directly attacked Gu Changge.The corpse that had shown change after his appearance released an oppressive might, and glowed like a bright sun that illuminated everything to expel all darkness in the world!Disappointment flashed through Gu Changge\u2019s eyes as he heard his words.He was naturally too lazy to keep using nonsense with this remnant spirit, and his expression turned even frostier than the spirit\u2019s as he said, \u201cDo you really think I give a damn about your inheritance? If not for the Halberd, do you think I would waste so much saliva on you? Do you really think you, a mere ghost of a dead man, can murder me?\u201dA [Domain-Traversing Talisman] had already appeared in his hands before he finished his words. Once the situation turned for the worse, he will immediately escape.\u201cJUNIOR, YOU ARE COURTING DEATH!\u201dGu Changge\u2019s words enraged the remnant spirit even further, and his aura surged even more violently. Gu Changge, however, showed a smirk.[Boom!]The [Five-Colored Mystic Vest] on his body released a hazy brilliance. This defensive artifact he randomly got from the System\u2019s Novice Gift Pack could easily block a full-powered blow from a False God.The [Five-Colored Mystic Vest] burst with a sacred brilliance, and Gu Changge discovered that the remnant spirit in front of him couldn\u2019t bring out too much power! The [Five-Colored Mystic Vest] completely blocked his attack.It\u2019s just that the [Five-Colored Mystic Vest] might not work anymore after it tanked the other party\u2019s attacks today.The ray of remnant spirit had the strength of a False God, so it could naturally sweep everything inside this Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm since it wasn\u2019t suppressed.What a pity, though\u2026it merely held the might of a False God.This discovery immediately increased Gu Changge\u2019s confidence.\u201cThe [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] is a good weapon that\u2019s only gathering dust in here. It\u2019s a weapon meant for slaughter, yet you sealed it here away from the world; I can\u2019t help but feel some heartache over it\u2019s fate.\u201dGu Changge casually spoke with his gaze glued to the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]. It\u2019s surging Devil Qi released a deep desire for slaughter, as if it couldn\u2019t wait to shatter the Heavens and bring chaos to the world!It brought more and more satisfaction to him, the longer he looked at it.Right then, Gu Changge stepped forward, and his bones creaked due to the pressure released by the remnant spirit.Ye Liuli, who was outside the hall, couldn\u2019t help but widen her eyes when she saw his actions.Instead of backing down, Gu Changge went ahead and even provoked the Quasi-Supreme without showing a change in his expression.He was audacious beyond measure, and was simply courting death.One had to know that Quasi-Supremes were ancient, grand-ancestor-level figures even in Ancient Immortal Families, who could protect the Family for millions of years, and spent all of their time hidden in seclusion.They were beings even someone like her couldn\u2019t see on normal days.\u201cThe [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] is a devilish artifact that can wipe out all the worlds if it comes into existence! Are you trying to help the Devil slaughter all living beings?\u201dThe remnant spirit couldn\u2019t help but show a change in his expression; he never thought that he wouldn\u2019t be able to suppress a mere junior.Back when he was alive and at his peak, he was a Quasi-Supreme worshipped by the myriad races, who could easily destroy stars with a flick of his finger, and held boundless might and authority over the world.Alas! He had been reduced to the point where even a brat still wet behind the ears could bully him!\u201cHelp the Devil slaughter? Unfortunately, this junior is the very Devil you are talking about,\u00a0Senior!\u201cGu Changge no longer concealed his devilish aura, and felt the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] \u2014 which had been silent until now \u2014 tremble in excitement.His conjecture was right on the mark.After all, the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] had a deep connection to his Devil Heart.\u201cYou Devil, be damned!\u201dThe remnant spirit\u2019s rage flared, and he released a terrifying sun towards Gu Changge that moved to burn him into ash. Just the aura of the sun seemed to have the ability to burn even existences of the False God Realm.It was apparent that the remnant spirit\u2019s fury had reached its limits, and it even willingly immolated its remaining existence for this attack.Unfortunately, the [Five-Colored Mystic Vest] released an even more resplendent brilliance in response.Gu Changge\u2019s steps didn\u2019t stop, and he only felt a little heavier. Other than that, he felt no discomfort.With a calm expression, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t accept Senior\u2019s words. Who are you to decide who is good and who is evil? I am darkness and you are light, just because you say so?\u201d\u201cSince you are a kind and upright man, then tell me why you left behind multiple traces of this inheritance, but only one map? Why did you set up so many patterns and structures around this palace to attract cultivators, only to let them die here?\u201d\u201cIs this the Dao of Light you are talking about?\u201dGu Changge sneered, and his statement stunned the remnant spirit, and he felt that something was indeed not right. If he thought about it, then Gu Changge\u2019s words weren\u2019t false.\u201c\u2026???\u201dBut soon, his complexion showed a drastic change, and he said majestically, \u201cWhat absurd nonsense! Since ancient times, cultivators have competed for opportunities, and its only natural for them to end up in life and death struggles! Opportunities and dangers go hand in hand, and I left behind my inheritance for the most suitable one.\u201dThe remnant spirit glared at Gu Changge with extremely cold eyes. He almost fell for this brats tricks, and doubted his own approach. Since ancient times, opportunities and dangers have gone hand in hand, and that was the ultimate truth of the world.\u201cSo you want to say that it\u2019s only right if I take this inheritance, right? For you, I might be a Devil, but for me, this inheritance is my opportunity!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s more? The one most suitable that you are talking about has already been killed by me. It\u2019s exactly as Senior dictated: opportunities and dangers go hand in hand\u2026\u201dGu Changge said with a faint smile.His words dazed the remnant spirit again, and he immediately used his ability to control the Void. His figure flashed, and he appeared in the depths of the palace in a blink.He was waiting for this chance! The chance to break the seal.\u201c[Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]\u2026\u201dGu Changge stood before the throne and reached out to touch the monstrous Halberd. Instead of receiving a fierce backlash, he felt a familiar gentleness from it.[Hum!]Immediately, many terrifying patterns appeared on the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]. They were the runes and formations that sealed the Halberd, and were awakened by Gu Changge.\u2026\u2026\u201cThis seal will break today\u2026\u201dNaturally, Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t miss such a great chance. He immediately released his Mystical Abilities, and his Spiritual Qi surged into the seals to destroy all the runes and patterns.Before descending to the Lower Realm, he had already studied how to trash such seals and formations. Many pitch-black runes condensed and intertwined in his hands, forming a soul-sucking object.A pitch-black [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] floated up and down in front of him, releasing wisps of mystical brilliance that rushed towards the seal on the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd].[Crack! Creak! Shatter!]The runes and patterns sealing the Halberd shattered one by one, releasing its suppressed Devilish aura that was as vast as an ocean.The [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] was, as its name suggested, able to destroy everything and leave desolation in eight directions all by itself!As Gu Changge held it in his hands, he felt its joy at gaining a new lease on life, its affection\u2026and many other emotions.Since the two had a similar origin, he would be saved from a lot of trouble. Obviously, his current strength wasn\u2019t enough to completely refine the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a Supreme-grade or above Artifact for no reason!Just a fraction of its power was already terrifying enough, so once it returned to its peak, it would truly be able to destroy the world with a single swing.\u201cNot good\u2026\u201dThe remnant spirit finally came out of its daze and noticed Gu Changge\u2019s actions. He wondered how this brat could be so fast?His expression showed a drastic change, and he rushed towards Gu Changge \u2014 he hadn\u2019t forgotten how he had died!Gu Changge\u2019s words might be reasonable, but they couldn\u2019t affect his decision. The return of the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] would surely spell doom for the world, and the world will fall into chaos as it swept through everything! He had to keep it sealed here \u2014 that was far more important than finding a successor for his inheritance!\u201cYou are late\u2026\u201dGu Changge glanced at him, and then pulled the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] from the corpse with a bang. At the same time, he swung the Halberd, and a pitch-black light surged through its body and condensed at its top.An incredibly indescribable and turbulent might as vast as the ocean spread around from it.Sure enough, the halberd wasn\u2019t hailed as the mightiest weapon since ancient times for nothing. It had the strengths of the other major weapons, while also being even more fierce and domineering then the others \u2014 it was an unparalleled weapon![Puff!]The remnant spirit couldn\u2019t believe what it saw. At the same time, a terrifying Devil Qi drowned him from head to toe as the Halberd slashed towards him. He had already consumed a lot of its power by attacking Gu Changge before, so it was obviously impossible for him to block this attack!The Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm could no longer suppress the power of the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]![Hum!]At the same time, a glistening [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] appeared above Gu Changge\u2019s head, and he directly devoured the remnant spirit!With that, the palace finally recovered its tranquility in all directions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The blade of the Halberd was pitch-black, and brilliant, blood-red veins pulsed on its entire body.It emanated wisps of cold light, and looked extremely terrifying under the thick Devil Qi that gathered around it.It wasn\u2019t light in weight either.Gu Changge estimated its weight to be a few tens of thousands of pounds, and the texture of its cold grip made it seem to be forged by Dark Immortal Gold.The longer Gu Changge watched it, the higher his satisfaction rose.His physique was relatively good even among his peers in the Upper Realm, but even he could feel the weight of the Halberd.Of course, he could pick it up because his Devil Heart had a deep connection to the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd. Let alone holding it in their hands, ordinary cultivators would be immediately obliterated if they so much as tried to touch it.The weight he felt now was specially set by the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd so he could get used to it well. It\u2019s real weight was far beyond one\u2019s imagination. It could easily smash through the Void just with the virtue of its density.\u201cIt seems that you regard me as one of your own kind, and will be following me from now on\u2026\u201dGu Changge spoke with satisfaction, and recalled the Great Dao Treasured Bottle above his head.The remnant spirit of a Quasi-Supreme could easily improve his cultivation by leaps and bounds after he completely digested it. Right now, it had turned into pure energy, and brought a feeling of euphoria to him as it rushed through his limbs.Of course, it was increasing his hidden might that he wouldn\u2019t bring out unless he had no other choice. As a Young Sovereign from the Upper Realm, Gu Changge naturally didn\u2019t lack trump cards, and this was one of his many hidden weapons.The Eight Desolate Demon Halberd, on the other hand, trembled in excitement at Gu Changge\u2019s words. It was as if it could understand his speech. At the same time, Gu Changge felt feelings of joy, affection, and excitement from the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd. No matter how he looked at it, it didn\u2019t resemble a murderous, demonic weapon that could slaughter all living beings and bring chaos to Heaven.Instead, it appeared to resemble the friendly neighborhood kid who lived next door.Its strange emotions stunned Gu Changge for a moment, but he got over his surprise soon after.He had heard rumors that the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd wasn\u2019t a forged weapon, but an innate existence that was born with its master who also held a Devil Heart. Of course, those rumors were too ancient, and their authenticity couldn\u2019t be verified.Anyways, he was happy to feel emotions from the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd. Everything in the world had its own spirit, and weapons were no exception to this rule.It was normal for weapons to gather spiritual wisdom and attain godhood after surviving for eons with Heavenly Dao Marks.After all, there were many ancient Heritages with hidden Ancestral Artifacts that had been passed down from time immemorial. These Artifacts would awaken at critical moments and show their godly might.The ferocious Eight Desolate Demon Halberd had been sealed here for innumerable years, and that had led to it developing its own wisdom.This naturally surprised Gu Changge, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel even more tempted.\u201cIt seems that you can understand my words?\u201dGu Changge said to the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd and waited for its reaction.It quivered in response.It\u2019s just that the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd could only convey emotions to him, and not speech.\u201cSo you really do understand my words! Do you understand that I will be your master from now on?\u201dGu Changge asked again.Of course, he would need to refine it first. Unless he refined it, he wouldn\u2019t be able to bring out the true might of the Halberd. Although he could control it right now, he couldn\u2019t bring out the might it held at its peak.The Eight Desolate Demon Halberd trembled with joy. As if to show how happy it was to have Gu Changge as its Master, it released strands of Devil Qi in the surroundings. It seemed to be its way of expressing its euphoria.\u201cYou are such a good weapon, yet you had to be sealed here for such a long time. As your Master, I can\u2019t help but feel my heart ache for you. Just follow me in the future, and I will directly kill whoever tries to harm you. If someone makes you unhappy, just tell me about them\u2026\u201dGu Changge also teased it with joy, and realized that it hadn\u2019t been too long since the Halberd gave birth to its consciousness. For now, it could only express simple emotions of joy, anger, and sadness, etc.As it heard his words, the Halberd\u2019s excitement soared, and the tip of its blade trembled. The Void around it turned turbulent just from that simple movement.\u201cHow about I give you a name? I will call you Xiao Hei from now on since you are so gorgeous\u2026\u201d[1: Xiao Hei translates to Little Black but Little Black doesn\u2019t sound all that noice for a gorgeous beauty.]\u201c\u2026\u201d[2][2: read: wtf, daddy! I trusted you.]Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but laugh in his heart. To him, Xiao Hei was far more alluring than a beauty.\u2026\u2026As Gu Changge left the palace, Ye Liuli followed after him with an extremely complicated expression. The two quietly headed towards the edge of the underground ancient city, where they had left the others.On the way, a System Prompt sounded in Gu Changge\u2019s mind.[Ding! Congratulations\u00a0, Host, for subduing the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd! You have unlocked the System\u2019s Weapon Storage!]The sudden Prompt surprised Gu Changge, and he wondered if this Weapon Storage was like a spatial storage artifact?He called out for his Attributes Panel,\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Host: Gu ChanggeHalo: Destined Heavenly VillainWeapons: Eight Desolate Demon HalberdIdentity: True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao PalaceBloodline: Devil Heart, Dao BoneCultivation: Conferred Lord (Late Stage)Mystical Abilities:Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex (7th Layer [75%])Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple (Talent)Myriad Changes Demonic Physique (Talent)Immortal-Devouring Demon Art\u2026Destiny Points: 9000Fortune Value: 1880 (Dark)System Shop: OpenWarehouse:Domain-Traversing Talisman x1One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x3Fortune Plundering Card x3\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014He soon found the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd listed under the row that showed his Halo. With the nature of the System, he was sure that only truly peerless Artifacts and Weapons could have the honor of showing up on his Attribute Panel.To put it in simple terms:\u00a0\u2018the System wouldn\u2019t bother about recording ordinary stuff even if Gu Changge mastered some cultivation method or refined a weapon.\u2019It looked down on them and treated them as unworthy of its attention.Since the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd\u2019s origins weren\u2019t simple, the System specially unlocked the Weapon Storage for it.Ordinary stuff that Gu Changge already owned \u2014 such as Blades, Swords, Cauldrons, etc. \u2014 wouldn\u2019t show up on his Attribute Panel. All of those things would still need to be stored in his storage rings, or somewhere else.Right then, Gu Changge gave out a command in his mind, and felt the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd disappear from his storage ring in response.At the same time, he saw a boundless, dusky space in his mind.[Hum!]The Eight Desolate Demon Halberd appeared inside the space out of thin air. The unfamiliar environment immediately startled it, and it released its terrifying Devil Qi that surged in all directions. It was like a cat that had its tail stepped on.Fortunately, it soon felt Gu Changge\u2019s aura and calmed down.\u2018This space isn\u2019t in the Void that exists around us, and only I can connect to it. This is good! After all, it won\u2019t be easy for me to hide the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd otherwise\u2026\u2019\u2018If some big shot sensed its existence on me, I am pretty sure they will forcefully snatch it away from me without giving a damn about my background and identity\u2026\u2019Gu Changge had no doubt about this.Once the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd\u2019s existence was revealed to the world, many greedy old monsters will come out for it. For them, it wasn\u2019t a weapon of mass slaughter, but a mighty artifact that could raise their strength to newer heights.This Weapon Storage from the System was a truly unfathomable treasure. No matter how mighty an existence, they wouldn\u2019t be able to sense the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd\u2019s aura.Not only could it completely hide the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd\u2019s aura, but it could also work as another trump card for Gu Changge. As this thought crossed his mind, Gu Changge realized that he had a lot of trump cards, but then he recalled that the calamity he would face would be even greater.His biggest worry was the Immortal-Devouring Demon Art. As for the Favored Daughter of Heaven[3] and the other Lus, Mus, and Dus his Original antagonized in the Upper Realm? He had already thought of methods to deal with them.He will carefully take care of them after he returns to the Upper Realm.[3: It was mentioned in the earlier chapters that Gu Changge\u2019s Dao Bone was stolen from a Favored Daughter of Heaven, just in case someone missed or forgot about this.]\u2026\u2026\u201cMy Lord, please forgive this old slave. This old slave couldn\u2019t do a good job! Lady Ye Liuli\u2019s people held me back and I couldn\u2019t stop her from breaking through our encirclement\u2026\u201dAs soon as Old Ming saw Gu Changge return, he knelt on the ground with an expression full of guilt, and begged for mercy.By now, they had already almost dealt with the entire beast tide.However, what shocked Old Ming was the fact that Ye Liuli, who couldn\u2019t wait to stab his Young Lord, was now quietly following behind him.Just what was going on?\u201cIt\u2019s alright. It doesn\u2019t matter even if she broke through and rushed over to my side. It\u2019s not like she could do anything to stop me.\u201dGu Changge didn\u2019t care too much about this matter, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back. I have settled my matter in the Lower Realm, so it\u2019s about time we Ascend back to the Upper Realm.\u201d\u201cAs you command, My Lord!\u201dOld Ming\u2019s face showed a solemn expression as he heard Gu Changge\u2019s words. From his Young Lord\u2019s tone, it was clear that he had obtained whatever he came down to obtain, and everything had gone smoothly for him.Old Ming couldn\u2019t help but feel joyful at this realization.Ye Liuli, on the other hand, showed an unpleasant expression as she unhappily talked to the followers she had brought along.Her pure as jade face showed listlessness, as if someone had bullied and ravaged her. Aunt Xue and the others couldn\u2019t help but feel puzzled as they saw her appearance.\u201cMiss, what happened to that brat named Ye Chen?\u201dAunt Xue asked.\u201cHe\u2019s dead; Gu Changge murdered him!\u201dYe Liuli responded with a sullen tone.What?!Aunt Xue\u2019s expression changed, and then she immediately felt happy. She had thought that her Young Lady would attack Young Lord Gu for that Ye Chen, but it seemed that they hadn\u2019t reached that point yet.As for Ye Chen? Who gave a damn about his death? He deserved it!As for why her Lady looked so listless? His death must be the cause.Although Aunt Xue felt distressed over her Lady\u2019s condition, she believed that time would wash away her pain and return her to normal.\u2026\u2026As they left the underground ancient city, Ye Liuli and her group didn\u2019t continue staying with Gu Changge. Gu Changge also couldn\u2019t care less about them. Now that his [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] was inside her Sea of Consciousness, it didn\u2019t matter where Ye Liuli fled.\u201cMy Lord, if this old slave isn\u2019t overreaching, then may I ask if you will be bringing that girl, Qiuhan, along with you when Ascending back to the Upper Realm?\u201dOld Ming asked respectfully, on their way out of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm.If Gu Changge wanted to bring her along, then he could look after her in the Upper Realm. Of course, it was possible that Lin Qiuhan would be the one looking after her Ancestor instead.No matter what world one lived in, it was always easier for beautiful women to succeed, compared to old men.Still, Lin Qiuhan was his descendent, so there was no need for him to envy her. If she could commit herself to his Lord, then his Lord will definitely not forget him in the future.\u201cI like that girl, Qiuhan, a lot, so I will naturally bring her along.\u201dHe had already made plans for Lin Qiuhan\u2019s terrifying talent for Alchemy, and would bring her to the Upper Realm to develop her for his own use.It just so happened that one of the major Alchemy Heritages in the Upper Realm hadn\u2019t yet found a particularly outstanding talent, even after searching for many years. They had no shortage of resources, but were in a dire need of talented disciples. They especially needed someone like Lin Qiuhan, whose talent in Alchemy could only be described as\u00a0\u2018monstrous.\u2019He estimated that they would be willing to do anything to get her!Talents with natural Pill Intent and a knack for Alchemy were mostly born in certain races that were closely related to the ecosystem of spiritual herbs, so there weren\u2019t many of them among the humans.Although the Upper Realm was vast beyond measure with endless territory, and even connected the Minor, Middle, and Major Lower Realms, the Humans weren\u2019t the dominant race.In the Lower Realms, it was said that there were thousands of races, but in the Upper Realm, that number jumped into the millions.Among the humans, Alchemists had a far nobler status than the other cultivators. The resources of the humans they alone controlled couldn\u2019t even be estimated.Gu Changge merely had to send Lin Qiuhan over to them. At that time, there will naturally be someone willing to put in a lot of resources and energy to cultivate her, and their Alchemy Heritage would also owe him a favor.Lin Qiuhan already belonged to him either way, so why wouldn\u2019t he get such a great advantage?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayColonies in the Upper Realm; Beloved Fianc\u00e9!The sudden tide of beasts inside the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm scared the cultivators of the Middle State \u2014 the whole Azure Lower Realm, even \u2014 and everyone thought that a terrifying catastrophe was at their doorstep. Monstrous Devil Qi surged out from the Secret Realm, acting as a sign for the birth of some peerless devil of mass slaughter. After all, the records inside the Secret Realm said that it was a place where a Demonic Weapon was sealed by an Honored Supreme.They wondered if the seal was about to break? Wouldn\u2019t the Demonic Weapon regain its freedom, sweep through the world, and push all living beings into Hell?Countless cultivators trembled at this realization, and deep panic gripped their hearts. But after waiting for a while, they realized that nothing worse happened. On the contrary, the Devil Qi from the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm seemed to weaken by every passing moment. It was as if the Demonic Weapon that was about to be released was sealed again by someone.This caused a massive sensation everywhere!Some people had doubted the authenticity of the records left behind in the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm, but it indeed contained signs of mass death. There were ancient ruins, fallen cities, and grotesque skeletons and corpses everywhere.They couldn\u2019t find fault with the claims laid in the ancient records!In the end, many came to a single conclusion:\u00a0\u2018The Young Lord from the Upper Realm had actually descended upon their Lower Realm to seal that Demonic Weapon!\u2019Many cultivators had seen the Young Lord from the Upper Realm enter the Ancient Secret Heavenly Realm, and he had left around half a month or so later. It was exactly when he left that the Devil Qi began to diminish. It couldn\u2019t be a coincidence, they thought. After all, the timelines were too consistent.The cultivators felt deep gratitude towards Gu Changge as they came to this realization, and even built an honorary statue of the Young Lord from the Upper Realm in the Middle, to pay homage to him forever after.Of course, Gu Changge didn\u2019t know about this matter. Had he known, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop himself from laughing out loud. Their ability to self-supplement\u00a0\u2018facts\u2019\u00a0was truly beyond ordinary \u2014 it was incredible. Why did they think he sealed the weapon, and didn\u2019t just take it away with him?Right now, he was with Old Ming and the others, and was preparing to head back to the Upper Realm.[Hum!]A brilliant ray of light flashed in the surroundings, and a tunnel in space opened up in front of them. At the same time, a magnificent, ancient palace-like structure showed itself.\u201cIs this how we will go to the Upper Realm?\u201dSu Qingge and Lin Qiuhan were shocked by the scene in front of them, for it was the first time they saw something like this. It was completely different from their imagination. They had thought that they would tear open a rift in the Void, experience a calamity, and Ascend like the other cultivators who had Ascended in the past.They had never thought that a spatial tunnel would open directly in front of them, as if it existed specifically for Gu Changge.\u201cThis is the Gu Family\u2019s Shrine of Reception that\u2019s responsible for bringing the Young Master back to the Upper Realm. It can easily travel through the myriad realms, and tear through the Void to go anywhere in the Universe.\u201dOld Ming explained to the two. At the same time, his way of referring to Gu Changge also changed from\u00a0\u201cMy Lord\u201d\u00a0to\u00a0\u201cYoung Master.\u201dIt showed a completely different status.\u201cIt can travel through the myriad worlds, tear through the Void, and go anywhere in the Universe\u2026\u201dSu Qingge was shocked. Gu Changge had never explained this to her before, and only said that she would understand when the time came for their Ascent. She understood it somewhat now.For False Gods, just tearing the barrier between the Lower Realm and the Upper Realm was already a mighty feat, while traveling through the Void at will was completely impossible.This method, on the other hand, was phenomenal.\u201cThe Young Master\u2019s family must be amazing\u2026\u201dLin Qiuhan was also shocked by such mighty means, and could only stand and watch the sky above her. She could only describe her current emotions and experience as\u00a0\u2018amazing!\u2019Old Ming agreed with her words.The Ancient Immortal Gu Family, the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, and Ancient Immortal Ye Family\u2026these were the behemoths that stood at the peak of the Upper Realm. There were others that could compare to them, but none that surpassed them.With that kind of power, they were obviously Heritages with eons of history behind them. The centuries they had gone through wouldn\u2019t be less than the grains of sand inside an ocean. They were so ancient that none of them could tell each other\u2019s true beginnings or background.What\u2019s more? He had heard that a few millenniums ago, the Ancient Immortal Gu Family had gotten involved in a war that resulted in death over millions of miles. One couldn\u2019t even estimate the number of Lower Realms that perished during that era. Countless creatures from various Lower Realms simply turned to dust just from the aftermath of the clash.That\u2019s just how terrifying these behemoths of the Upper Realm could be.[VILFIC: although it is said that there are 3000 Minor/Middle/Major Lower Realms in the previous chapters, it doesn\u2019t mean that there are exactly 3000 of each of those. 3000 is an expression used to mean innumerable. For example, there are 3000 DAOs, but, in reality, there are far more. It\u2019s just a number used to mean innumerable.]\u201cThis old man was lucky back then, and met an Elder from the Young Master\u2019s family who saved me. Otherwise, I don\u2019t know which corner of the Upper Realm I would be mining at right now\u2026\u201dOld Ming\u2019s sudden words shook Su Qingge and Lin Qiuhan to the point of breathlessness.He was mining in a corner of the Upper Realm?The mighty Ancestor of the Ancient Lin Family, a legendary figure in the Lower Realm, received such degrading treatment in the Upper Realm? No wonder all the creatures of the Lower Realm were nothing more than ants to the residents of the Upper Realm.Gu Changge was already giving them extremely preferential treatment!Afterwards, Old Ming further explained to the two girls, \u201cYoung Master is the heir of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, so what does this little Shrine amount to? You must know that the Young Master\u2019s identity is at the pinnacle of the Upper Realm. Not only is he the heir of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, but he\u2019s also a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and might even become its heir, too. With these two top-tier identities, there\u2019s no one more honorable than the Young Master.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your great fortune to be recognized by the Young Master. Countless noble ladies with great backgrounds in the Upper Realm have desired the Young Master\u2019s affection, but they were ignored\u2026\u201d\u201cMake sure you have some self-knowledge, and don\u2019t do anything that would embarrass the Young Lord.\u201dNaturally, he had to be the one to explain all of this to them, as his Young Master would surely not toot his own horn and explain such minor details to them.It was only right for someone like him to be the one to reveal his identity.Su Qingge and Lin Qiuhan were shocked by the revelation, and couldn\u2019t help but continuously nod as if they were chicks pecking on rice. Back in the Lower Realm, they had already felt that Gu Changge had a terrifying identity, and it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to describe him as a supreme being. But now\u2026they couldn\u2019t describe what they felt when they realized just how monstrous his identity and background were.Su Qingge, especially, felt the impact from the realization. She had recently started to recover more and more fragments of memories through her second soul, and all of them contained vague knowledge about the Upper Realm. She seemed to have some relationship to the Upper Realm, and had been looking for an opportunity to tell Gu Changge about this matter.\u201cLet\u2019s go; it will take a while for us to reach the Family.\u201dRight then, Gu Changge finally opened his mouth, and said to the two women. At the same time, he took the lead in stepping into the Shrine of Reception.[Hum!]Soon, everyone entered and the Shrine entered the spatial tunnel, closing it after it disappeared inside. If one could see it from the outside, they would find it traveling through the darkness of space at extreme speed. It tore through the turbulent Void around it, and moved towards the core of the Upper Realm.Gu Changge watched the turbulent Void outside the Shrine, and sorted the memories regarding the Upper Realm in his mind.The Upper Realm was an extremely vast place. In his opinion, it was more like a collection of many major and minor realms and planets. The core of the Upper Realm was an extremely prosperous place where many ancient Heritages and Races co-existed.Every Heritage and Race reigned over boundless territory with countless realms and planets.\u2026\u2026By now, they had already arrived in the territory of the Upper Realm \u2014 it was just that they were currently at its extreme borders, and terrifying world laws tried to press down on them. Many worlds approached and repelled each other to create an extremely turbulent and disastrous region that could easily obliterate cultivators who hadn\u2019t reached a certain level.This was the reason Ascending from the Lower Realm wasn\u2019t all that easy. Only extremely powerful beings or artifacts such as the Gu Family\u2019s Shrine of Reception could shuttle through this region where barriers of many worlds collided.[VILFIC: our boi Lin Tian got f!ck!d exactly around here, if my guess isn\u2019t wrong, which I doubt it is.]They passed by innumerable worlds as they neared the core of the Upper Realm. Every passing realm was far higher in level than the Azure Lower Realm, and was closer to the core of the Upper Realm. Obviously, they were occupied by the powerful Dao Lineages. The wider a Heritage\u2019s territory, the more Realms they controlled.In Gu Changge\u2019s opinion, they were like colonies.The behemoths in the core of the Upper Realm \u2014 such as the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, etc. \u2014 stood at the top of the food chain, and innumerable ancient forces were subordinated to them.Each of those forces had their own colonies of many realms and planets. A force\u2019s reach was decided by their background, and this was why the people of the Upper Realm considered the people of the Lower Realm to be nothing more than a bunch of ants when compared to the locals.Background and identity decide the difference between people, especially in the Upper Realm.Of course, the ancient worlds in the core of the Upper Realm were in a league of their own.\u2018This kind of setting is completely in line with the Ascension trope from the novels. Unfortunately, I am already at the peak of the world.\u2019[1][1: normally, Protagonists go from their littol world to a bigger Lower Realm and then an even bigger Lower Realm \u2014 from Minor to Middle to Major \u2014 and then they reach the upper Upper Realm. They reach the top step by step, and gain an identity with which they can look down on everything and anything. Gu Changge is already at that peak and doesn\u2019t need to take those steps in-between \u2018cause he\u2019s a villain.]Gu Changge felt satisfied when he thought about his starting point. Be it talent, background, cultivation base, or something else\u2026he was already at the top in all aspects. He felt that it was awesome!What\u2019s more? His trip to the Lower Realm had brought him a great harvest, so he planned to digest it all as soon as he returned to his Family.\u2026\u2026[At the same time, in the Supreme Immortal City of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty.]As the oldest Immortal Dynasty of the Upper Realm, the Supreme Immortal Dynasty had stood unshaken since time immemorial. It governed endless territory, and there were even rumors that the Supreme Immortal Dynasty was the Upper Realm\u2019s first dynasty.Inside a splendid, majestic hall, a beautiful woman wearing a golden, imperial robe stood with her arms crossed before her chest. Her loose, imperial robes fluttered and did nothing to hide her unparalleled bearing, picturesque features, and jaw-dropping beauty.Her hair covered half of her fairy-like visage, but she still looked breathtaking.Although she didn\u2019t say a word, and her face showed an indifferent expression, one could feel a terrifying might from her that could easily make the world tremble. She appeared to be standing above a sea of stars \u2014 it was as if she was holding the sun and the moon in her hands, and stepping over the universe beneath her.Everything about her radiated\u00a0\u2018mighty!\u2019She was the fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty,\u00a0Yue Mingkong.\u201cImperial Brother, you should give up the position of Crown Prince now.\u201dThe woman in the imperial robes said with a flat tone. At the same time, she gazed at the man, who was slumped on the ground before her with a bleak face, without a hint of emotion in her eyes. Many Ministers with different expressions stood around the man. At this time, all of them had their foreheads covered in cold sweat, and didn\u2019t dare to make any noise.In just half a year, their Princess Mingkong used many thunderous means to dethrone her brother, the now-former Crown Prince. Every step she took was made with perfection, and they couldn\u2019t help but tremble at her methods.She was so outstanding that many mighty Immortals of the Dynasty couldn\u2019t help but praise her.She made everyone understand that just because she was a woman, it didn\u2019t mean she was worse than any man. She was unparalleled, and held just as much ability to be their Overlord.In the royal family, where the weak were disdained and destined to be eliminated, there were many who admired her. After all, the fourth princess\u2019 talent was beyond anyone else, and she had already surpassed her siblings when it came to cultivation.She will be a peerless Empress in the future!This was the thought that went through the minds of many Ministers.\u201cSomeone, bring my Imperial Brother away\u2026\u201dYue Mingkong indifferently commanded after taking a final look at the slumped man in front of her.\u201cI will be the Crown Princess from now on! Only I shall reign as the Empress of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty!\u201d\u201cRetreat!\u201dYue Mingkong\u2019s eyelids drooped, and an expression of deep contemplation appeared on her face after she finished her words, giving the people around her even more pressure. The Ministers in her presence trembled and felt their hearts palpitate as they quietly retreated. No one could guess what was going through her mind.Although she was a woman, her might was enough to give them shivers.\u201cHalf a year more\u2026\u201d\u201cYou should have returned from the Lower Realm, right? My beloved fianc\u00e9\u2026\u201dYue Mingkong muttered to herself. Although her words were spoken with great affection, her eyes showed a deep flash of frost\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You were the one I loved the most, but now, you are also the one I hate the most\u2026\u201dYue Mingkong looked at her empty surroundings and involuntarily closed her eyes. Some tears could be seen at the corner of her eyes, but soon, the tears disappeared and she opened her indifferent and cold eyes once again. Her voice was calm as she spoke, and the turbulence in her heart also subsided \u2014 she had already gotten used to the heart wrenching pain that had assaulted her for the past half year.Yue Mingkong didn\u2019t understand why she ended up three thousand years in the past. By now, half a year had already passed since she returned in time, but the scene of the day she married Gu Changge was still fresh in her mind.The world trembled at their union, chants of the Great Dao descended upon them from the Heavens, golden lotuses bloomed everywhere, and clear springs gushed out from the earth. Dressed in a red wedding dress, and wearing a phoenix crown and imperial robes, she stood bashfully beside the world\u2019s most handsome and unparalleled man.On their wedding night, they had crossed their arms and drank wine to show the world that they were now one.She had thought that all of her wait and sacrifice had been worth it, and that she would finally receive his love! She had helped him establish the world\u2019s strongest Immortal Dynasty, fallen out with her father for him, and even helped him clear his name from suspicions that claimed he was the inheritor of Devil Arts\u2026Alas! After waiting three thousand years for her bridal night with him, what she received was a look of ridicule and indifference from him. After that, a boundless darkness spread around her, and a heart wrenching pain gripped her. She finally realized that the person she loved more than anything in the world never felt anything for her. Everything he did was for himself.In the end, he murdered her in cold blood! He had merely deceived her to free himself from suspicions about him being an inheritor of Devil Arts. After he had squeezed all use out of her, he threw her away like a used tissue.She, on the other hand, had trusted him from the bottom of her heart, and not once did she entertain thoughts that he might just be an inheritor of Devil Arts.Yue Mingkong wanted to call her past self\u00a0\u2018retarded\u2019, and couldn\u2019t understand how she could let herself be deceived by Gu Changge\u2019s lies. People like him didn\u2019t have a heart. One couldn\u2019t even estimate the number of people someone like him had tricked without them knowing they were dancing on the palm of his hand.\u201cShould I call you Gu Changge, or should I call you Gu Wuxin (heartless)? You are truly a heartless monster who has no love for others! I worked hard for you for three thousand years, yet you didn\u2019t give me a shred of affection in return. Since the Heavens have given me another chance, I will not let history repeat itself\u2026\u201dYue Mingkong\u2019s expression turned as cold as a glacier. She had already matured, and was no longer the naive and foolish girl from her past life, who was obsessed with that almost-perfect man who had her heart wrapped around his finger.As the fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, she was the one who disappointed her father the most in the past. But now, in just half a year, she had stomped all of her competitors in the royal family, and even dethroned her eldest brother from his position of the Crown Prince.Her menacing means easily crushed every record set in the Supreme Immortal Dynasty since its existence. Even her father \u2014 who always looked at her with disappointment \u2014 couldn\u2019t help but shower her with praises.All of this was thanks to her regressing to the past. She knew much due to the fact that she had lived for three thousand years, so she could take flawless steps and dominate over everyone with ease.\u201cIn the end, I was nothing more than a tool in your eyes. To you, I was nothing but a toy that you used to get yourself a clean reputation\u2026\u201d\u201cGu Changge, since you never cared about me, then don\u2019t blame me for taking everything from you in this life! I will make you experience all of my pain\u2026\u201d\u201cAlas! You are a heartless devil, so how can you understand my pain and everything that I experienced? It\u2019s such a pity, or I could have made you fall in love with me, and then killed you just like you killed me!\u201d\u201cIt seems that I have no choice but to destroy your life so much that you will have no choice but to stay by my side! After all, instead of death, a life like that will be the worst punishment for someone like you\u2026hehe\u2026\u201dYue Mingkong\u2019s imperial robes fluttered, and she stood with her hands behind her back. Her gorgeous visage showed a deep calm as she lost herself in contemplation.At the same time, she turned her face towards the east \u2014 that was where the Ancient Immortal Gu Family resided.She knew that Gu Changge had already returned from the Lower Realm, and he had also gotten what he descended for. She also knew that soon, her father would bring her along to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family to discuss the matter of her and Gu Changge\u2019s marriage.The marriage between the Supreme Immortal Dynasty and the Ancient Immortal Gu Family was a matter of great importance, and it attracted the attention of countless behemoths and big shots. After all, it involved the majestic fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, and the only son of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s Patriarch.The most important thing was that her father desired to take advantage of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s might to annex other Immortal Dynasties. Unfortunately, everyone in the Upper Realm knew about the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s means, and it wasn\u2019t a hidden fact that no one had ever been able to take advantage of them. Even though the Supreme Immortal Dynasty was rumored to be the first Immortal Dynasty of the Upper Realm, it wouldn\u2019t be an exception to that fact.In her last life, she had never made sense of such intricate matters. Although she was talented from birth, and was also the fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, she didn\u2019t have the wits and means of the royal family like her siblings, and this fact brought great disappointment to her father.She was nothing more than mediocre among her peers of the royal family.As for why the Ancient Immortal Gu Family agreed to her engagement with Gu Changge? Yue Mingkong didn\u2019t understand this in her last life, but now she did. It was because her father promised to give the Ancient Immortal Gu Family innumerable benefits in return! She was merely a tool that would be married off to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s Young Master.She was a little girl when she first met Gu Changge. At that time, he was cultivating atop a piece of spiritual bluestone. A brilliant glow filled his surroundings, Dao runes turned into flowers and bloomed, and divine brilliance dazzled everyone who laid their gaze upon him.His Heavenly appearance astonished her, and then she was informed that he would be her future husband. Just that one look was enough for her to give away her heart, and she sent herself to ruin for him in her previous life.\u201cFortunately, it\u2019s still not too late to correct my mistakes! Soon, we will meet again, Gu Changge\u2026\u201dYue Mingkong returned from her trip down memory lane, and slowly closed her eyes. She now held Gu Changge\u2019s greatest secret in her hand. Once it\u2019s exposed that he was the inheritor of the Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art, the entire world would rush to hunt him to death \u2014 that was no exaggeration.Alas! She knew that she couldn\u2019t expose this fact without solid evidence, or nobody would believe her words. The Gu Changge of this time took every step with caution, and rarely used the Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art. Even then, he would make sure to erase every trace of his devilish acts.Worse still? There was a part of her heart that didn\u2019t desire to expose him like that; she didn\u2019t want to see such a day where the entire world would be against him\u2026Yue Mingkong couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Even though she had regressed, her heart was still not ruthless and determined enough.\u201cNo! How could I still love him? It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t want to defeat him by despicably exposing his identity as the inheritor of Devil Arts! I want to take him down fair and square \u2014 I want to take everything away from him in an upright manner\u2026\u201dSoon, Yue Mingkong shook her head and muttered to herself.\u2026\u2026\u201cWe pay our respects to the Young Master!\u201d\u201cWelcome back, Young Master!\u201dThe ancient Shrine of Reception traveled from the edge of the Upper Realm, and then traveled through many massive teleportation formations. After a long journey, they finally appeared at the gate of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s territory. All the disciples who stood outside the Gu Family\u2019s gate showed extreme respect for Gu Changge, and it was as if they were specially standing there to welcome him.Gu Changge responded to them with a nod.In front him, myriad immortal mountains and islands floated in the air, releasing divine lights that rushed towards the sky. Spiritual mist floated everywhere, and the entire territory of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family was shrouded by a terrifying formation that shone with bright flares that resembled the brilliance of the sun and the moon.Right now, it was merely releasing a fraction of its true might. If it activated in all its glory, even mighty God Kings wouldn\u2019t be able to pass through it.\u201cIs this the foundation of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family?\u201dSu Qingge and Lin Qiuhan felt their heads buzz. Although the journey all the way here had already shocked and numbed them to all sorts of scenes, the magnificent view in front of them still disturbed their hearts, and they couldn\u2019t calm down. With this level of territory and magnificence, they could no longer be called a mere\u00a0\u2018Family\u2019\u00a0estate \u2014 they were a major world![VILFIC: Ancient Immortal Gu Land!]\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dGu Changge said. At the same time he wondered how he should go about showing the rest of the world to them? Especially Lin Qiuhan, who he was going to send to an Alchemy Heritage. Although no one should have the guts to bully them with their relationship to him, there were always some who went against the norm. After all, the two came from the Lower Realm, so the people of the Upper Realm would obviously pick on them.\u201cOld Ming, you should arrange their residences.\u201dGu Changge instructed the old man standing beside him. The family had strict rules, and divided the family\u2019s estate into Inner and Outer regions. Right now, they were in the Outer Region. As for the Inner Region? Only the direct descendants of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family could enter and live there.Su Qingge and Lin Qiuhan couldn\u2019t go to the Inner Region until they were given some identity in the Family.After that, Gu Changge turned into a stream of brilliant light, and headed straight towards the Inner Region. Since he had returned to the Gu Family, his top priority was to meet his father. After all, not everything he did was planned by him \u2014 his father was also deeply involved.\u201cYoung Master has gone to the Inner Region, so we should deal with your matter first. This old slave will first teach you two the rules of the Gu Family. Make sure you don\u2019t do something that would embarrass the Young Master when you are beside him in the future.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, don\u2019t [be hill-billies and] show surprise at everything and anything, even if you come across people from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.\u201dOnce Gu Changge left, Old Ming brought them along and advised them while traveling through the various floating mountains and islands. Su Qingge was much better than Lin Qiuhan when it came to getting used to their new surroundings, while Lin Qiuhan kept nodding her head like a little chick pecking on rice, \u201cI understand, Ancestor!\u201dAs soon as Old Ming heard her words, his expression changed and showed deep fright. In a hurry, he corrected her, \u201cDon\u2019t call me Ancestor or anything like that in the future \u2014 be it in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family or outside. It\u2019s enough if you just keep this fact in your heart.\u201dAfter all, Lin Qiuhan seemed to be highly valued by his Young Master, and there was a chance that their relationship might develop further in the future. What did his relationship with Lin Qiuhan as her Ancestor amount to? The Gu Family was extremely strict with their hierarchy, and if this fact came out, he might just end up at the gallows.Although Lin Qiuhan didn\u2019t understand these nuances, she would naturally follow her Ancestor\u2019s command.At the same time, she felt overwhelmed, and her eyes reached a point where they might burst with how wide she opened them, as she watched the magnificence of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s divine structures. In her heart, she couldn\u2019t help but sigh,\u00a0\u2018Young Master Gu\u2019s family is scary!\u2019She had never imagined she would see such magnificent islands and immortal mountains in her life, so much so that she couldn\u2019t suppress her shock no matter how hard she tried. Immortal mist floated everywhere, and rumbling waterfalls flowed down from the sky. Various ominous beasts roamed the mountains and islands, and their terrifying aura surged towards the sky like a wave.The Spiritual Qi in the surroundings was so dense that she thought it would liquefy at any moment.Her reaction didn\u2019t surprise Old Ming. Back when he first saw this scene thousands of years ago, he was just as astounded. It was the first time he saw the tip of the iceberg known as the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.Comparing the Ancient Families and Heritages of the Lower Realm to them was like comparing villages made of mud to Immortal Islands that floated high above the Heavens.A lot of thoughts passed through Old Ming\u2019s heart, and he couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cThis is merely the Outer Region, which is nothing compared to the Inner Region. As for the God-Child Island where the Young Master resides? It\u2019s a true Immortal Land that has come straight out of a fairytale! I am not even qualified to go near it. Of course, you\u2026\u201dSpeaking of which, Old Ming suddenly felt envious of the two.At the same time, Gu Changge arrived in the Inner Region after using the Family\u2019s exclusive teleportation arrays that connected the Outer and Inner Regions, and the rest of their territory.He stood in front of a magnificent and majestic hall. Suddenly, the door in front of him opened, and a warm voice seemingly belonging to a middle-aged man sounded from inside.\u201cChangge, you are back?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Villain\u2019s Father; Seeing Things Clearly!The majestic hall in front of him towered into the sky like an ancient behemoth, and uncountable runes surged around it. The aura of Heaven and Earth surrounded it in worship, and gave it the appearance of a sacred shrine.Inside the hall, a middle-aged man, with an appearance somewhat similar to Gu Changge\u2019s, sat cross-legged in cultivation. Chaotic Spiritual Qi revolved around him, and the sounds of Heavenly chants and Great Dao rhythms faintly sounded from his surroundings.His aura surged towards the Heavens, and pressed down on the world around him. He was like an ancient god who could split the sky with a single movement, and no one could estimate his true might.As soon as he saw Gu Changge enter the hall, he showed a gentle expression which he only ever showed in front of Gu Changge. Before others, he always showed an expression of aloofness, as if he was a lofty deity looking down on all living beings. Even when he passed down his order, he only used his Spiritual Sense. Rarely did he open his mouth to speak.He was Gu Changge\u2019s father, the current Patriarch of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family!At the same time, he was also one of the most terrifying people in the Upper Realm, and stood at its very peak. A random order from him could shake the entirety of the Upper Realm, and dictate the life and death of innumerable souls.It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that the Patriarch of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family was an Immortal giant who looked down on the world from high above.\u201cFather, this son has returned.\u201dGu Changge arrived before his father, and stood with a submissive expression.\u201cDid everything go well? Your trip to the Lower Realm this time dissatisfied a lot of the Elders, and they were continuously asking about your whereabouts, and wouldn\u2019t stop passing certain remarks.\u201dGu Lintian said with a gentle smile, without a shred of fallacy in his expression.The fact that Gu Changge had a Devil Heart wasn\u2019t known by many in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. Only his parents, and some of the ancestors and very close people in their lineage[1] knew about this matter.[1: a single family can have multiple lineages. One ancestor has 10 sons, and those sons have their own descendants, so that would make the family have 10 lineages.]The matter of him having a Devil Heart was a sensitive topic. Since its first appearance in the Upper Realm, Gu Changge was the ninth known person to possess a Devil Heart, and the only one who was still living well.The first eight holders of the Devil Heart \u2014 no matter their backgrounds or might \u2014 were known to have turned into evil demons who brought disaster to the world around them.The people related to them never had good ends either!The appearance of a Devil Heart was akin to an ominous sign. In the Upper Realm, holders of the Devil Heart were not just treated as the enemies of the world, but they were also avoided by the rest of the world like a plague.Gu Changge\u2019s birth with a Devil Heart had stunned Gu Lintian for a while. Fortunately, he was quick to respond and immediately suppressed the information in the Family. Right now, only a few of his very close confidants knew about this matter.Leaving everything else aside, just the fact that Gu Changge possessed a Devil Heart would be enough to invalidate his succession to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s position of Patriarch. His talent meant nothing before that fact, and the hostility he would receive in the Family would be no different from what he would receive from the outside world.The rest of the Gu Family\u2019s members would never allow him to be their successor!Fortunately, during his early years, Gu Changge found a girl in the Family who possessed the Dao Bones. For Gu Changge\u2019s future, Gu Lintian decisively decided to dig out her Dao Bones to give them to Gu Changge, so as to cover up his Devil Heart.They had successfully used this cover-up for more than ten years without anyone finding out the truth of the matter [that Gu Changge had a Devil Heart].The Family Elders and others who knew about the incident [of them digging out the girl\u2019s Dao Bones] had already been exiled from the Gu Family, and even their cultivation bases had been suppressed and sealed.Their once-prosperous lineage had gradually withered over time, and the matter was buried under the dust of time.It\u2019s just that when he later tried to find the little girl, he realized that she seemed to have disappeared without a trace. Back then, they hadn\u2019t finished her off, and allowed an Elder from her lineage to take her away. When they inquired about her whereabouts, they realized that she disappeared soon after she left with that Elder.Even after he investigated her whereabouts multiple times over the years, he came across nothing. After all, it was a shameful act. Although many of the Family\u2019s ancestors had turned a blind eye to the matter, and the girl\u2019s lineage had also slowly declined in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, who could tell there weren\u2019t one or two ancient monsters from that lineage hidden in the depths of the Family\u2019s Ancestral Lands?After all, all the ancient monsters of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family were buried in the Ancestral Lands. Unless they dug them out, they wouldn\u2019t know whether the other party was dead or just in seclusion.\u201cI succeeded.\u201dGu Changge responded with a smile, and recalled just how much love and care his parents showered him with.As was the norm with the various cliches and tropes, the parents of the Favored Children of Heaven either didn\u2019t care about their kids, or thought that their kids weren\u2019t good enough, and ignored them. The parents of the villain, on the other hand, always doted on their villainous kid and showered them with all the love that was possible in the world.The so-called\u00a0\u2018kill the young and the old shall come'[2]\u00a0wasn\u2019t all bogus talk. How else would the villain\u2019s entire family accompany them to their grave?[2: In normal novels, once the Protagonist kills the young villain, the villain\u2019s parents come to avenge him. Once the parents are killed, the grandparents follow. So on and so forth. At one point, the Protagonist gets tired and slaughters the entire family of the villain, and not even their mutts and sows escape the calamity.]\u201cTake that out so I can have a look. For now, you won\u2019t be able to control the weapon of the former Devil Heart master.\u201dGu Lintian said.\u201cUnderstood.\u201dGu Changge responded, and then made a mental command. Immediately, the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] disappeared from the System\u2019s Weapon Storage.[Hum!]The Void trembled, and a terrifying, murderous aura that seemed to desire the destruction of the Heavens and the Earth spread in the surroundings. Out of thin air, the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] appeared in front of Gu Changge.However, right at that moment, its originally terrifying might subsided and turned into a small, flickering flame as if someone had suppressed it. Gu Changge could see it flicker like a candlelight that would go out as soon as it met a gust of wind. The [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] conveyed it\u2019s terror to him as it trembled in his hands.\u201cFather, you scared it.\u201dGu Changge said helplessly.At the same time, he released his Spiritual Sense to calm the scared little Halberd. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t easy to erase the Halberd\u2019s fear for an existence as mighty as Gu Lintian. When it\u2019s consciousness was born, the Halberd had thought that it was the mightiest in the world, but after it came across Gu Lintian, it realized that it was like a small boat standing before a surging ocean.\u201cIt seems that you chanced upon another Fortuitous Opportunity down there. I didn\u2019t feel anything when you took it out of thin air. That\u2019s good! Your mother and I can rest assured, and I won\u2019t need to listen to her continuous nagging all day long.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also good that this thing doesn\u2019t have any evil intentions towards you, or there would be no need to keep its consciousness. A soulless Artifact is much better and can bring about a lot of peace of mind\u2026\u201dGu Lintian nodded with a smile, and then withdrew his Spiritual Sense after probing it enough.Although the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] had an extraordinary origin, and was the weapon of the previous master of the Devil Heart, it was nothing in front of an existence like him. Even if it recovered to its prime, a single thought from him would be enough to suppress it.But since it was now Gu Changge\u2019s weapon, he couldn\u2019t be bothered about it. Gu Changge had a lot of other secrets as well, but he never asked him about them. He was alright with Gu Changge keeping secrets even from him.Still, if something threatened his child\u2019s well-being, then he would definitely protect him at all costs, and wouldn\u2019t allow anything or anyone to harm him.Gu Changge responded with a nod. He wasn\u2019t a heartless man, and understood well how much the people around him cared about him. Although he was a villain, it didn\u2019t mean he would be an unfeeling ingrate \u2014 it just meant that he was destined to be against the Favored Children of Heaven.\u201cYour cultivation has increased by leaps and bounds after this trip to the Lower Realm, so I don\u2019t think any geniuses from other forces will be able to contend against you\u2026\u201dGu Lintian couldn\u2019t help but praise after he probed his son\u2019s current cultivation. Back when he was around Gu Changge\u2019s age, he had only just reached the Conferred Lord Realm, but Gu Changge was already at the peak of the Conferred Lord Realm\u2026no, he was half a step into the Conferred King Realm.There were many Young Supremes in the Upper Realm, but he doubted there were any at the same level as Gu Changge.\u201cFather, you flatter me!\u201dGu Changge responded with a smile, but didn\u2019t refute his father\u2019s words. After all, he had spent 5000 Destiny Points to raise his cultivation to the peak of the Conferred Lord Realm. With his might, he could easily flatten even existences of the False God Realm with a single slap.Of course, Gu Changge also knew that he had a lot more cards up his sleeve about which his father knew nothing about \u2014 Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art was one of those. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t trust his father, but that it was something that was better kept hidden. The less people who knew about it, the safer he would be.\u201cThe [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] is the weapon of the previous holder of the Devil Heart. Although it isn\u2019t enough to reveal the fact that you also have a Devil Heart, try not to use it unless absolutely necessary, before you have taken charge of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2026\u201dGu Lintian advised Gu Changge. He wasn\u2019t worried about someone taking away the weapon from Gu Changge \u2014 after all, someone who dared to rob their Gu Family\u2019s stuff wasn\u2019t yet born in this world \u2014 but worried that the matter of him having a Devil Heart might come out because of it, and that would lead to Gu Changge receiving a lot of backlash from inside and outside the family. Although Gu Changge was the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s Young Master, his position as the next Patriarch wasn\u2019t yet set in stone.The weapon was good, but the identity of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s future Patriarch was even more important.Once that was settled, those old fogies wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. Even if the fact that Gu Changge was a holder of the Devil Heart came out, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything but accept him as their Patriarch.In fact, Gu Lintian had already developed a step-by-step plan for Gu Changge\u2019s future, and he was now only waiting for him to slowly take reign of the Family.\u201cContrary to my thoughts, it seems that you have finally started to see things clearly\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Gu Lintian noticed the [Spirit Nourishing Jade] on Gu Changge\u2019s person, and instantly felt Yan Ji\u2019s breath from it. Although his face still showed his usual indifference, he felt relief in his heart.\u201cFather, you are misunderstanding\u2026\u201dGu Changge was first stunned, but then he laughed out loud, and explained Yan Ji\u2019s origins to Gu Lintian.Of course, he didn\u2019t say anything about provoking discord between Ye Chen and Yan Ji. If he hadn\u2019t found the entire thing interesting and needed to squeeze Ye Chen\u2019s fortune dry, he wouldn\u2019t have bothered about her. After all, stealing the Favored Son of Heaven\u2019s Master right in front of his eyes was a matter of great exhilaration.Now that he had returned to the Upper Realm, he wasn\u2019t in a hurry to decide what to do with Yan Ji. However, there was the fact that she was also from the Upper Realm, so he reckoned that she might know about a lot of hidden opportunities.\u201cShe is from a race that is born from the Innate Flames of Heaven and Earth. I had thought her kind had already perished, but since you like her, there\u2019s no harm in letting her stay by your side.\u201dGu Lintian said. He recognized Yan Ji\u2019s origins in a single glance.Her race born from the Innate Flames of Heaven and Earth was once the strongest race among the many godly races, and their children were born with mighty cultivation right from the get go.Unfortunately, all of them had long disappeared from the world.Judging from her appearance, she seemed to be in her twenties, while Gu Changge was also young, so he had no objection in her staying by his side.\u201cShe should have been in the Great Sacred Realm at her peak, so her talent isn\u2019t to be looked down upon\u2026\u201dGu Lintian said.\u2018No wonder her Fortune Value is so high\u2026she turned out to be at the Great Sacred Realm.\u2019Gu Changge finally understood her situation to some extent.When Yan Ji was at her prime, she was a behemoth of the Great Sacred Realm! She was someone who could easily go anywhere in the Upper Realm, crush stars in the palm of her hands, and travel through the Universe with ease.In the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, God Kings could be said to be many, while Sacred Realm cultivators could be regarded as true masters in the various lineages. As for Great Sacred Realm cultivators? They could easily become Elder-level figures in the Family.Having said that, he felt that he earned massive profits on this trip down to the Lower Realm.\u201cGo to the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace as soon as you are free. The number of people criticizing you for your half-year long disappearance isn\u2019t small over there. Moreover, you also need to settle the matter of becoming their heir\u2026\u201dAs Gu Lintian mentioned this matter, his eyes turned deep, and terrifying scenes flashed past his pupils. It was as if the Universe was about to collapse as all the stars shattered and fell one by one.At this moment, he resembled a supreme being who could dominate the entire Universe.\u201cPlease rest assured, Father! This child is bound to come out on top in the fight for the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s position of heir.\u201dGu Changge assured him.His father was an ambitious man, and so was he. Sooner or later, the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace will belong to their father-son pair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, Gu Lintian asked Gu Changge if he had faced any issues with his recent cultivation, and needed his help. He was a truly meticulous father.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell his father that his cultivation now depended on hoarding and spending points. As he watched his father\u2019s gentle expression, he decided in his heart that he had to work even harder in raising his strength. Although he was strong enough right now, there were many in the world with evil intentions.What\u2019s more? The feeling of absolute might, and having everything play in his hands according to his will could only be described as\u00a0\u2018wonderful.\u2019It was simply incredible!Before he left his father\u2019s hall, Gu Lintian said a few more words to Gu Changge, \u201cYour mother also missed you quite a lot, so make sure you stop by the Primordial Divine Sect if you have time.\u201dGu Changge nodded to him in response, \u201cUnderstood, father!\u201dCertain memories flashed through Gu Changge\u2019s mind at the mention of his mother. Back in the day, his mother was the goddess of the Primordial Divine Sect, while his father was the mightiest elder of the Primordial Divine Sect.The Primordial Divine Sect had always been on friendly terms with their Ancient Immortal Gu Family. It was a great ancient sect that had stood tall through many epochs, and was also an Immortal Heritage. It\u2019s status was no weaker than the many Supreme Heritages of the Upper Realm.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but cackle in his heart at these thoughts.He was a nouveau riche with a terrifying background even with the Upper Realm\u2019s standards. Even if he was born a waste, no one would dare to provoke him. After all, his mother was notorious for protecting her kid and hiding his shortcomings.It was only natural that he would grow up as someone who bullied men and women alike.Of course, anyone familiar with cliches and tropes would know that he was a cookie-cutter villain that could be found anywhere, and didn\u2019t have a good end.\u201cSoon, that girl, Mingkong, will come here with her father to discuss the engagement between the two of you. Make sure you don\u2019t treat her with the same indifference as before \u2014 after all, she\u2019s your future wife.\u201dGu Lintian seemed to remember something suddenly, and said with a solemn expression, \u201cYou used to dislike her for her submissive personality, but her actions in the last half year will certainly surprise you. She\u2019s shown the majesty of an Empress already! Mingkong, that girl, is very suitable for you; your Mother and I are quite satisfied with her. If you can get her help in the future, you will definitely hold the world in the palm of your hands, no matter how big it might be.\u201d\u201cFather, you can rest assured.\u201dGu Changge couldn\u2019t help but freeze for a moment after hearing his words, but soon recovered and responded with a nod. At the same time, a dreamy visage of a divine fairy flashed through his mind.His fiancee, the fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, Princess Yue Mingkong.An expression of interest covered his face as he thought about her. At the same time, he wondered if this fiancee of his was the Favored Daughter of Heaven his System prompted him about a while back?He recalled the information about his fiancee in his mind. The fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty was a gorgeous beauty with a terrifying background, and she belonged to a power that stood at the top of the food chain in the Upper Realm. Be it her appearance, talent, background, or anything else, not many women could match her.From his memories, though, he realized that his Original had no feelings of affection for her. He always treated her with indifference and kept some distance between them, and his attitude towards her didn\u2019t resemble what a man should have towards his fiancee. He always felt that as a princess of an Immortal Dynasty, Yue Mingkong wasn\u2019t up to par when it came to personality and cunningness.Other than that, he never did anything untowards her. He never offended her, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any animosity between them. And since they were coming here to discuss their engagement, he doubted that it would be to follow through with that bloody\u00a0\u2018engagement annulment\u2019\u00a0trope, right?Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but be puzzled when he thought about this. In his opinion, a Favored Daughter of Heaven in the Upper Realm couldn\u2019t be simple. Be it her background or means, they would be far beyond what the Favored Children of Heaven in the Lower Realm could dish out.This kind of treatment\u2026weren\u2019t perfect wives like her reserved only for the Favored Sons of Heavens?With his knowledge from all the novels he had read in the past, that possibility wasn\u2019t out of the options.[1][1: there are two engagement-breaking tropes. One is where the arrogant, genius beauty breaks her engagement with the down and out Protagonist. And the other is where the best-grill (loving, caring, perfect, submissive) develops some guts after meeting the Protagonist and goes to break off her engagement with her villain fiance.]The System didn\u2019t tell him who the Favored Daughter of Heaven was, so he could only rely on his own knowledge from his previous life to guess. Of course, once he met her in person, he would be able to guess everything. For now, it didn\u2019t matter even if his guesses were incorrect.After leaving his father\u2019s place, Gu Changge went straight back to the God-Child Island where he resided. On the way, he felt countless terrifying auras surging around everywhere. Those were the auras that others in his family accidentally released amidst their cultivation.Each divine island in the Inner Region had its own concealing formation that prevented others from prying inside, but how could those formations truly suppress the breaths of the mighty when they cultivated?If one looked from a distance, they would see visions of behemoths that could swallow the stars and pluck the moons. It was commonplace here in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.If one went a bit deeper, they would come across palaces floating in the sky, shrouded in chaotic mist and Spiritual Qi rumbling everywhere. If they went even deeper, they would reach the Ancestral Land of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.The Ancient Immortal Gu Family could only survive through the epochs in the Upper Realm due to those that hid in the Ancestral Land. When a mighty enemy came knocking at their door, the descendants would rush to the Ancestral Lands and dig out those old, monstrous Ancestors who had secluded themselves since unknown eras. Those giants could easily deal with anything.Over time, the Ancient Immortal Gu Family came to be known as one of the most mysterious existences of the Upper Realm, and even the descendants weren\u2019t sure just how deep their background was. That made it even more impossible for the outsiders to know their roots. Of course, no one had the guts to dig out their Ancestral graves to see how far back they could identity themselves.[2][2: Imagine a Super-Duper-Ultra-Behemothian-Deity-Collapsing-Heavenly-Rending Giant hiding in one of the coffins down there, and some rando fool digs his grave and wakes him up.]\u2026\u2026Gu Changge\u2019s return to the Family caused quite a stir. Many of the Family\u2019s members knew that he had gone down to the Lower Realm, but they didn\u2019t know where he actually went, or what his spatial coordinates were, nor why he went down there in the first place.In fact, there were many in the Family keeping an eye on his every move. Although the Ancient Immortal Gu Family appeared to be a solid whole from the outside, on the inside, they were continuously entangled in strife and everyone was looking to one-up the one standing next to them.Although Gu Changge was the Young Master of the Family, he wasn\u2019t yet the future Patriarch \u2014 the Elders would be the one deciding whether he would have that position or not.As a huge Immortal Family, there were countless lineages that dwelled inside the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and the relationship between the various lineages wasn\u2019t all that harmonious. Other than Gu Changge\u2019s main lineage, there were four more major lineages in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, excluding the one that had now declined.Every lineage wanted to have the position of the Patriarch so they could command all the other lineages, and dominate the Gu Family\u2019s endless territory. The rest of the lineages also had their own talented geniuses who were eyeing the position of future Patriarch like greedy wolves.Of course, although the Family allowed competition, they strictly forbade anything that could result in the death or crippling of someone from the same family. The elders also loved to watch the struggle between their juniors, and it was precisely this competition that kept the Family from turning into stagnant water.[3][3: competition makes their kids struggle for stronger might, and that, in turn, brings stronger blood to the ranks of the family. If there\u2019s no competition, the younger generation will turn into a bunch of nouveau riche who only know how to blow their Ancestors\u2019 hard-earned dough, and their cultivation won\u2019t improve. At one point, they will become so weak that anyone would be able to come and either: directly obliterate, or turn them into puppets.]The matter of Gu Lintian\u2019s lineage suppressing that one lineage some ten years ago, which resulted in their rapid decline, had caused a lot of waves among the senior management of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.\u2026\u2026[At this moment, on the main peak of another lineage of the Gu Family.]Ancient trees towered into the clouds, and majestic palaces and magnificent courtyards could be seen scattered around with brilliant glows giving them a gorgeous touch. A number of old peopl with mighty auras busied themselves in discussing some matters.\u201cThat brat, Changge, looks much stronger than before after he returned from the Lower Realm \u2014 he\u2019s already reached the Peak of the Conferred Lord Realm! No genius from the other lineages is his match anymore!\u201dAn old woman shrouded in divine radiance, with wisps of golden light flashing past her eyes, said in a helpless tone. She was one of the elders of the Gu Family with a terrifying aura and cultivation base.\u201cNo matter what the problems we have with him, we must accept that Gu Changge\u2019s talent for cultivation is truly beyond anyone else in the world! His title of God-Child isn\u2019t for nothing. I fear that it won\u2019t be long before he breaks through to the True God Realm!\u201dThe old man sitting next to her added. Although he wasn\u2019t from Gu Changge\u2019s lineage, he couldn\u2019t help but praise his talent. It was naturally a good thing to have such a genius in their Family.\u201cIt seems that the position of Patriarch will end up in the hands of their lineage once more. That would make them the ruling lineage for three continuous generations\u2026\u201dAnother old man said with a shake of his head.\u201cWhat a pity that Old Thirteen\u2019s lineage has declined to obsolescence. I am afraid that unless the Ancestors of their lineage come out from their seclusion, there\u2019s no one in the Family who would be able to help them return or rise again\u2026\u201dRight then, another one spoke, and his words made the expressions of everyone around him change. Their expressions showed some fear and unwillingness, and they didn\u2019t want to talk much about this matter. What happened some ten or so years ago was a taboo in the Gu Family. It involved a ruthless inner strife that was only known to the higher ups.After all, if the matter came out, it would shake their prestige and they would end up losing all face in front of the outside world. Many cultivators and forces would laugh at them when they found out that such a shameful matter had transpired in their Immortal Family, yet the perpetrators were still sitting at the Family\u2019s top without any repercussions.\u201cEven if the Ancestors of Old Thirteen\u2019s lineage woke up and found out about that event, I doubt they would do anything. Judging from Gu Changge\u2019s talent, he will definitely be an extraordinary figure in the future, and there\u2019s even a chance that he might surpass the current Patriarch!\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, I must say that Old Thirteen\u2019s lineage sure is pitiful. Not only were they exiled from the Family, but even their cultivation bases were suppressed. By the way, I have recently heard some rumors that are not good for our Gu Family. What\u2019s more? They seem to be related to Changge\u2026\u201d\u201cOh! What happened?\u201d\u201cThe little girl from Old Thirteen\u2019s lineage isn\u2019t dead. It\u2019s just that we lost track of her because we didn\u2019t keep a good eye on her, thinking that she would never be able to make a comeback with her talent gone.\u201d\u201cAlas! She\u2019s such a pitiful child. If we had protected her better, something like that would have never happened. Gu Changge was so young back then, yet he already had a cruel and vicious heart! Who would have thought that he would attack his own cousin like that\u2026what will become of our Gu Family if it fell into his hands in the future?\u201dAnother elder of the Family sighed. He had always been brooding over what happened back then, and couldn\u2019t forget it. Of course, it was thanks to the Family\u2019s law that members of the family couldn\u2019t kill each other, or that lineage might not just be exiled from the Family\u2026\u201cLand of Forsaken Immortals\u2026I seem to have heard news about that child as well\u2026We have already let her down once, so make sure you don\u2019t let the Patriarch find any trace of her.\u201d\u2026..Su Qingge and Lin Qiuhan quietly stood inside a grand and magnificent palace. They had already learned the rules of the Gu Family, and knew what not to do, and where not to go.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but nod after learning about this matter.There was nothing more that needed to be said to them, and the issue of their identities had also been resolved.Naturally, he didn\u2019t bring them to the Upper Realm to keep them around as pretty vases.Lin Qiuhan had a terrifying talent for Alchemy, so he would send her to an Alchemy Heritage sooner or later. As for Su Qingge? Well, there didn\u2019t seem to be any problem even if he kept her around as his maid.As the number one beauty of the Eastern Wilderness, she had an enchanting figure and features that were rare to find even in the boundless Upper Realm. Alas! That would be too wasteful if he took into account her sharp wit.What\u2019s more? Her Fortune Value was even higher than the young geniuses of the Gu Family, and that only added to the problem. She wasn\u2019t as simple as she appeared.A mighty Yan Ji was more than enough by his side.\u201cQingge, so what is your plan for the future? Back in the Lower Realm, you were always talking about the Upper Realm, but now that we are in the Upper Realm, you won\u2019t even open your mouth?\u201dGu Changge looked at her and said with a teasing tone.Su Qingge stared at him and said with a weak voice, \u201cQingge knew that she couldn\u2019t catch Young Lord\u2019s fancy\u2026do you not want Qingge anymore, Young Lord?\u201dAlthough Su Qingge took great pride in her intelligence, she didn\u2019t know what to do in her current situation. Unlike Lin Qiuhan, who still had an Ancestor in the Upper Realm, she was all alone and had no one. She couldn\u2019t even imagine what would become of her if Gu Changge didn\u2019t want her around anymore.Even someone as mighty as Old Ming ended up mining stones for those great powers that dwell in the Upper Realm, after all. As for someone with a good face and figure like her? She reckoned that her fate would be far more miserable, and she wouldn\u2019t just end up as a slave who toiled around all day in mines!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayReincarnation of a Demoness; Only Bad Apple in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family!As soon as they came to the Upper Realm, Su Qingge was made to witness the horrifying behemoth that was Gu Changge\u2019s family. She couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy in her heart over the last period of time. After all, she was merely a woman, and even though she had another soul inside her that would occasionally give her all sorts of ideas, she still couldn\u2019t help but feel a little flustered at the situations that came to her mind.She didn\u2019t know what to do if Gu Changge didn\u2019t want her. After all, there couldn\u2019t be a lack of gorgeous and talented women around someone with an identity as terrifying as Gu Changge\u2019s.She, on the other hand, was a clumsy person who probably couldn\u2019t please him much.Someone like her, who was born in the Lower Realm, meant nothing in the eyes of the people of the Upper Realm \u2014 she was very clear about this after her memories merged with more and more fragments of memories from her second soul.Not just that, she somewhat understood the terrifying status that Gu Changge possessed!Back then, fear was one of Su Qingge\u2019s biggest reasons for surrendering herself to Gu Changge. But after she spent more and more time with her, she started to develop an inexplicable feeling of attraction towards her. Although he was unpredictable \u2014 sometimes completely indifferent, even \u2014 and looked down on everyone and everything in the world, he still treated her well and spoiled her much.Once someone moved a woman\u2019s heart, she would naturally not want to separate from them.So now that Su Qingge heard Gu Changge\u2019s question, she felt her head buzz, and subconsciously thought that Gu Changge didn\u2019t want her anymore.[1]Of course, it wasn\u2019t completely her fault. Any other woman in her place would have probably thought the same.The only person she could rely on asked her about her plans for the future, so wouldn\u2019t that mean that he was preparing to drive her away?[1: either this bruh forgot about her Bed-Warming-Cultivation-Raising Physique, or she thinks Gu Changge is really a saint who doesn\u2019t covet it.]Gu Changge had only planned to tease Su Qingge somewhat by asking her that question. He didn\u2019t need to focus on cultivation like other people, so he was feeling bored, and could only entertain himself somewhat by bullying Su Qingge like this.In response to his words, however, he saw Su Qingge\u2019s eyes redden somewhat. At this, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud.\u201cWhy would I bring you to the Upper Realm if I didn\u2019t want you? I would have left you in the Lower Realm if that was the case. You are so cunning on normal days, so why did you turn so muddle headed over something this minor?\u201dGu Changge spoke with a chuckle.Whether he had feelings for Su Qingge or not, but bullying her surely brought great joy to his heart. Beauty was like a collectible, and the more you had around, the more they would be pleasing to the eye.Of course, whether they could affect his judgment and reason was a completely different matter.He only needed a few nice words to coax her.Su Qingge was stunned for a few moments after she heard his words, and bit her lips while feeling wronged, \u201cYoung Master, you are so annoying\u2026\u201d\u201cBy the way, don\u2019t you have something to tell me?\u201dWith that, Gu Changge stared at her with a playful smile and asked. After all, he knew Su Qingge was up to something. Even after so many days, her Fortune Value hadn\u2019t stopped increasing, and it had already risen by a lot. Such a strange phenomenon could only mean that she was hiding some Fortuitous Opportunity or something.Gu Changge guessed that Su Qingge was either the reincarnation of some mighty expert he might or might not have heard about, or she was somehow related to the Upper Realm.This would make sense from a plot-perspective.Thinking of this, he waited for Su Qingge\u2019s response.\u201cYoung Master\u2026I am sorry for hiding this from you, but there is something that I haven\u2019t told you\u2026\u201dGu Changge\u2019s sudden words prompted Su Qingge into raising her gorgeous visage, and she gazed upon his face. His expression dumbfounded her, and she immediately understood what he was talking about.Either way, she had been looking for an opportunity to tell Gu Changge about that matter\u2026it was just that she didn\u2019t know how to start the conversation.\u201cTell me, I am all ears.\u201dAt the same time, he looked at Su Qingge\u2019s Fortune Value.There were 500 Points!When he first met her, she only had around three hundred, but after coming to the Upper Realm, her Fortune grew wildly. He reckoned that her relationship with the Upper Realm wasn\u2019t a simple one.\u201cThe matter is that from the moment of my birth, I was different from normal newborns. Not only did I know a lot of things right from birth, but I also knew that another \u2018me\u2019 existed in my Sea of Consciousness\u2026\u201dSu Qingge carefully arranged her thoughts and explained to Gu Changge.\u2018Two souls in a single body? That\u2019s interesting. It seems that my guess wasn\u2019t too far off. Not only was she some mighty figure in her previous life, but she also has another soul.\u2019Of course, he couldn\u2019t have guessed this situation. Could it be that Su Qingge\u2019s Fortune kept increasing because she had started to fuse with her other soul?This explained her peculiarity.It was for this reason that Gu Changge\u2019s luck also kept rising, albeit slowly. After all, Su Qingge belonged to him now.\u201cAre your and your other soul\u2019s memories shared?\u201dGu Changge asked.\u201cWe are in a sort of a symbiotic relationship[2], and I can only recall some of her memories. The rest of the memories seem to be sealed by a fog that is slowly dissipating and releasing them.\u201d[2: the two are very close but can\u2019t read each other\u2019s mind.]\u2018Gu Changge isn\u2019t someone we can trust, so how could you reveal our greatest secret to him?!\u2019At the same time, the malevolent voice of her other soul sounded in Su Qingge\u2019s mind, but she ignored her.After all, she was in complete control of their body.\u2018Seal? That shouldn\u2019t be the case. Most likely, her memories are damaged. It\u2019s possible that she was some mighty figure in the Upper Realm who had no choice but to reincarnate in the Lower Realm. After that she was destined to end up as the Favored Son of Heaven\u2019s woman, as dictated by the plot. After that, her origins would be revealed to not be all that simple, right?\u2019Gu Changge guessed in his heart after listening to her explanation. Of course, there was a chance that his guess wasn\u2019t correct.\u201cYoung Master, I occasionally dream of an ancient battlefield shrouded in darkness, with all sorts of creatures fighting\u2026\u201d\u201cI dreamed that I had turned into a demoness who was worshiped by many creatures that I have never seen before!\u201dSu Qingge trembled at the mention of this.In those dreams, she resembled an incomparably frightening, ruthless, and bloodthirsty monster who desired to destroy everything!She has thought that it might have been a nightmare, but as she spent more and more time in the Upper Realm, she experienced more of those visions.She wasn\u2019t stupid, and guessed that either those were memories from her past life, or they had something to do with her other soul.She had always wanted to tell Gu Changge about this matter as she believed that Gu Changge, who had experienced far more than her, might have a better idea about her situation.She right now had no semblance to the demoness in her dream.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is! You don\u2019t have to worry about this matter; although I can\u2019t tell much, but I do have a few guesses in my mind.\u201dGu Changge comforted her with a smile.His words brought relief to Su Qingge\u2019s tumultuous heart.Gu Changge, on the other hand, felt that it might just be a good thing for her. With two souls in one body, and intelligence that couldn\u2019t be rivaled by many, Su Qingge might just reach unexpected heights if she merged with her other soul and memories. At the same time, he will reap massive benefits, too!As for her being a demoness? He would need to ask his mother as she knew better about these matters, and should have some information. After all, the Primordial Divine Sect was once called the Primordial Demon Sect.It was only through the continuous effort of its many disciples and elders that it could later change its name from Demon Sect to Divine Sect. Although their acts didn\u2019t change much, their new name sounded far more upright. After all, the word\u00a0\u2018Demon\u2019\u00a0didn\u2019t hold any positive meaning no matter which corner of the world one went in.What\u2019s more? Gu Changge\u2019s inheritance of Devil Arts seemed to have some connection to the Primordial Demon Sect, too. Although there wasn\u2019t a direct connection, they weren\u2019t strangers to each other.[3][3: this is referring to his Devil Arts inheritance (and its creator, probably) and the Primordial Demon Sect.]\u2026\u2026Gu Changge left the two girls after explaining some more details to them. Next, he needed to consider how to deal with his affairs in the Family.His father had already told him that many elders of the Family had been criticizing him behind his back, and the biggest reason for that was the act of bone-digging his Original had committed back in the day.Although many in the Gu Family fought with each other, they still had a bottomline and made sure not to cross certain lines. Killing members of the Family was strictly forbidden, and all offenders would receive severe punishment.The Original Gu Changge, who was still a child back then, coveted his cousin\u2019s talent and ruthlessly dug out her Dao Bone. Although this matter was suppressed back then, it couldn\u2019t be hidden from the elders of the Family.Although they didn\u2019t say anything out loud, their hearts were filled with dissatisfaction towards Gu Changge.The bone-digging trope\u2026Gu Changge, as a transmigrator, was naturally more familiar with this trope than anyone else, and he also had to bear its burden since he crossed over into the body of the perpetrator.\u2018Gu Xian\u2019er, my cousin who was three years younger than me\u2026\u2019\u2018This bone-digging trope is more difficult than dealing with those useless Favored Kids from the Lower Realm. Of course, if the events are different from the trope that I know of, then it would be fine, but if my cousin has a willow deity behind her, then\u2026\u2019\u2018I have always asked my father to find her since I can vaguely sense that she is alive due to the Dao Bone that I took from her\u2026unfortunately, my father never found her trace. That must mean there\u2019s an expert backing her!\u2019Gu Changge thought of countermeasures in his heart.After all, the Favored Children of Heaven in the Upper Realm would definitely be miles ahead of trash like Ye Tian and Lin Chen.What\u2019s more? Many elders of the Gu Family felt guilt towards his cousin, whose Dao Bone he dug out and took for himself, and felt remorse for not protecting her well. They didn\u2019t even deign to give him a good look.Once this matter came out in the world, their Gu Family would end up as nothing but laughing stock, and the members of his Family would certainly not take his side at that time.As Gu Changge was thinking about these matters, his eyes narrowed and he thought of something.\u2018According to the Original\u2019s memory, that cousin of mine had a grandfather who went to another realm to search for something, and ended up getting trapped there. After that, her parents, who were worried about him, brought along a bunch of people from their lineage and went to rescue him\u2026in the end, she was left in the Family under the care of some of the trustworthy people her parents could trust.\u2019\u2018Since she and the Original were similar in age, he chanced upon her and discovered her Dao Bone. He immediately coveted it so he could hide his Devil Heart\u2026\u2019Although Gu Changge didn\u2019t claim to be a good person, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do something as heinous as digging the bone of a little girl even younger than him.Besides, wouldn\u2019t it be better to play with her and develop her into one of your trump cards?After all, that cousin seemed to be cut from the template of a Heavenly Emperor\u2026Alas! There was no use thinking about the what-ifs.\u201cThankfully, the two sides didn\u2019t descend into madness and tried to slaughter each other. After the persuasion of various elders, their side took a step back, and my father also only exiled them from the Family. What\u2019s more? There aren\u2019t many in the outside world who would dare harm them\u2026\u201d\u201cNow that I know that my cousin is alive and hiding in some unknown land, I reckon that it won\u2019t be long before she shows herself and challenges me to have her revenge.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which? Am I the only bad apple in the Gu Family? No wonder I was born with a Devil Heart. What an evil curse. My father had to do all that just to cover this Devil Heart up.\u201dGu Changge muttered to himself. By now, he had already sorted his thoughts.Soon, a playful smile appeared on his face. Although his situation seemed troublesome, there were a lot of methods he could use to deal with it.[VILFIC: The names of the trash are intentionally messed up.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAbandoned by the World; Peach Demon of the Forsaken Land!Gu Changge\u2019s ideas weren\u2019t all that sophisticated. What mattered the most to him right now was to figure out his cousin\u2019s current whereabouts, and also make some preparations in advance. After all, there was a high chance that his cousin was backed by a mighty master, and the other people of the Gu Family were also involved.For now, he could only command and mobilize some of the forces from his own lineage. As for the other lineages? He reckoned that they would only submit to him after he became the Patriarch of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. Besides, using the other lineages to figure out the whereabouts of his cousin would only result in more losses than gains, and his subsequent plans will also be affected.Gu Changge fell into contemplation for a while, and then summoned his retainer who was outside his residence.\u201cA\u2019Da.\u201d\u201cA\u2019Da is at your command, Young Master!\u201dA strong man dressed in black stepped inside with a respectful expression. From his appearance, one could tell that he wasn\u2019t human as fine, light blue scales could be seen covering his arms. A\u2019Da had the blood of the Immortal Dragon Clan rushing through his veins, and the Gu Family had raised him from his birth. Unlike the other foreign retainers of the Family, he could enter and leave the Inner and Outer Regions at will.He was currently at the False God Realm, and could be regarded as one of Gu Changge\u2019s confidant.\u201cGive this letter to Old Ming and tell him to investigate the matter written inside for me\u2026\u201dGu Changge commanded. As soon as his words fell, a letter written with Spiritual Sense fell into A\u2019Da\u2019s hands.Old Ming was a God King who could be considered a mighty figure even in the Upper Realm, so it would be more convenient for him if he investigated the matter. Before he had gone to the Lower Realm, Gu Changge always instructed A\u2019Da to deal with his matters, but now that he had a strong God King at his beck and call, everything became much easier for him.\u201cUnderstood, Young Master!\u201dA\u2019Da received his command to leave, and immediately left for the Outer Region to find Old Ming.The Gu Family was a behemoth with a territory vaster than one\u2019s imagination. To get from the Inner Region to the Outer Region, one had to travel through various Teleportation Formations. If someone accidentally rushed into the Gu Family\u2019s territory, they could easily lose their way and spend the rest of their life looking for a way out.Of course, that is, if the murderous beasts that roamed all over the Gu Family\u2019s territory didn\u2019t tear apart that person first.Once A\u2019Da left, Gu Changge called out for his Attributes Panel \u2014 he hadn\u2019t improved his cultivation by much after returning to the Upper Realm.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Host: Gu ChanggeHalo: Destined Heavenly VillainWeapon(s): Eight Desolate Demon HalberdIdentity: True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao PalaceBloodline(s): Devil Heart | Dao BoneCultivation: Conferred Lord (Peak Stage)Mystical Abilities: Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex [7th Layer (99%)]Myriad Changes Demonic Physique (Talent)Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple (Talent)Void Ability (Talent)Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art\u2026Destiny Points: 4000Fortune Value: 2000 (Dark)System Shop: OpenWarehouse:Domain-Traversing Talisman x1One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x3Fortune Plundering Card x3\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014His Fortune Value had risen to two thousand Points without him knowing, and it wasn\u2019t a small rise.Of course, with two thousand Points of Fortune Value in his hand, Gu Changge wondered if he should break through to the Conferred King Realm right away? Once his cultivation rose to the Conferred King Realm, a sublime change would appear in his body, and his combat power would soar to completely new heights.It\u2019s just that Fortune Value was something ethereal, and he didn\u2019t know what the consequences might be. Back when his Fortune Value was near zero, nothing happened to him \u2014 neither good, nor bad. After thinking about it for a while, Gu Changge guessed that it might be because of his Dark Fortune.\u2018System! Since Dark Fortune doesn\u2019t exist in the normal seven levels of Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, and Purple, could it be an anomaly? What will happen if I lose all of my Fortune Value?\u2019Gu Changge asked in his mind.As soon as it heard his question, the System responded,\u00a0[Host, you don\u2019t need to worry about this matter. The concept of Fortune Value is the System\u2019s method of calculating rewards and penalties as actual Fortune is illusory and can\u2019t truly be quantified. It was converted into these easy-to-understand values so you could comprehend it with ease.]After all, Gu Changge was a transmigrator with a different thought process from the natives of this world, so he could easily understand the concept of values and numbers.[As Host is an anomaly, the world has long given up on you. In fact, even if all of your Fortune Value disappeared, it won\u2019t impact you in any way. Host, you must have noticed that no matter how much Fortune Value you have, it has no effect on your daily life, the opportunities you can encounter, and the sort\u2026][Even if you chance upon a great Fortuitous Encounter and/or Inheritance, you won\u2019t be able to increase your Fortune Value. The only way you can earn Fortune Value is by conquering people blessed with great Fortune, or by killing Favored Children of Heaven\u2026]The System immediately cleared a lot of Gu Changge\u2019s doubts with its explanation, so Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but nod in response.It was no wonder that even though his Fortune Value had reached a level far higher than what Ye Chen started out with, he still hadn\u2019t come across some Heavenly Treasure or Opportunity falling into his lap out of nowhere. He could have never imagined that the world would give up on him like this!So this was the treatment reserved for the villains! If the villains wanted some Fortuitous Opportunity, they had to go to the Favored Children of Heaven.Of course, Gu Changge preferred to pick ripe fruits instead of searching for opportunities in every nook and cranny of the world. Finding Leeks to reap was the best opportunity in itself.\u2018So the Fortune Value is nothing more than a reserve of Destiny Points for me? Since it\u2019s\u00a0 Fortune Value that I earned by myself, it has an exchange ratio of 10 Destiny Points for 1 Point of Fortune Value?\u2019Gu Changge was surprised by this realization. His two thousand Points of Fortune Value were like two thousand bricks of gold that he could exchange for wealth at any time. His actual Fortune was an anomaly that couldn\u2019t be quantified or displayed by the System.He felt relieved after this explanation from the System.In addition to killing the Favored Children of Heaven, he could also raise his Fortune Value by conquering blessed people like Su Qingge and Lin Qiuhan. What\u2019s more? He also received a small wave of Fortune Value every single day even without doing anything. This entire System could be called a game of farming \u2014 he felt as if he was\u2026rearing pigs!\u2018Exchange 1000 Points of Fortune Value for Destiny Points!\u2019Gu Changge no longer hesitated after realizing everything, and immediately exchanged a thousand points of his Fortune Value.[Ding! Exchange succeeded! Host, congratulations on receiving ten thousand Destiny Points.]The System\u2019s Prompt sounded in his mind, and he immediately saw fourteen thousand Destiny Points on his Attributes Panel.\u201cSystem, jack me up!\u201d (add points to my Cultivation)[Hum!]Gu Changge felt a strange energy wash through his body right after he uttered his command. Brilliant rays of Great Dao gushed out of his limbs and bones, and his Dao Bone released a terrifying hum and a splendid brilliance spread in his surroundings. His Devil Heart was immediately restrained, and didn\u2019t make a single peep.At the same time, the floodgates of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex\u2019s eighth layer broke open in Gu Changge\u2019s mind, and myriad insights and comprehension regarding the Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex merged with his memories.[Boom!]Gu Changge heard a rumble inside his body, as if a surging river had taken down a dam. A vast quantity of Spiritual Qi rushed through his meridians to his Dantian, and his cultivation broke through the Conferred King Realm!\u2018I still have six thousand Destiny Points left.\u2019Gu Changge thought in his mind. At the same time, a hazy figure resembling the incarnate of the Great Dao itself slowly materialized behind him, and released a terrifying aura. The hymns of the Great Dao resonated in its surroundings, and brilliant runes intertwined around it, giving it the aura of an ancient and majestic god looking down on the world.This was the power contained in the Dao Bone he took from his cousin \u2014 it was the Incarnate of the Dao that could suppress everything and anything in its path. For a Young Supreme like Gu Changge, it could be considered to be his strongest trump card.\u2018As soon as I broke through to the Conferred King Realm, my strength improved by leaps and bounds, and the feeling I now get is completely different in quality when compared to the feel of the Conferred Lord Realm.\u2019\u2018This feeling\u2026tsk, tsk\u2026\u2019Gu Changge clenched his fist, and the Great Dao Incarnate behind him imitated his action. At the same time, Gu Changge felt as if he was a mighty sovereign who could bring about Heavenly Punishment to obliterate his enemies!This was the might that would have originally belonged to his cousin, and Gu Changge was very clear about this. After all, someone else\u2019s talent and ability would never truly belong to him. He had to find a way to deal with the issues that were inherent to the Dao Bone as it was right now. He would either need to devour it using the Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art, or he would have to replace it with another Bone or something from the System.[1][1: since the Dao Bone didn\u2019t belong to him from birth, it will inherently try to reject his body \u2014 just like a transplanted organ \u2014 and that might cause him severe losses in the long run. Talent and the sort received from the System(s) normally don\u2019t have such a restriction.]But not yet. For now, the Dao Bone could help him achieve some of his goals besides providing him with divine might.Soon, Gu Changge looked through the System\u2019s Shop. After all, he still had six thousand Destiny Points in his wallet, and even a thousand Fortune Value in his reserves. With such massive wealth, he would be foolish not to find a way of increasing his strength and trump cards as soon as possible.Although the Ancient Immortal Gu Family had a lot of treasures in their stash, Gu Changge felt that their catalog couldn\u2019t compare with the System\u2019s offerings. What\u2019s more? He would need to make contributions to the Family before he could take something from them. Although he was the Young Master of the Family, it didn\u2019t mean he could take whatever and whenever \u2014 his status only allowed him to choose before the rest.\u00a0(first dibs)Other than that, he had already mastered the most powerful treasures of the Gu Family that were suitable for his current cultivation base.In the end, Gu Changge settled for a Mystical Ability.[Infinite Immortal Wisdom], worth five thousand Destiny Points.He already had the [Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple], which brought him at the top among his peers when it came to attainments of the Primordial Spirit\u2019s might. Now that he had another powerful Mystical Ability to cultivate his Primordial Spirit, the two would complement each other and raise his power to the next level.\u2018Exchange!\u2019Gu Changge immediately exchanged for it, and the records of the [Infinite Immortal Wisdom] surged into his mind. At the same time, he consumed some of his Destiny Points\u2026[Hum!]In the end, Gu Changge\u2019s [Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple\u2019s] incarnate[2] rushed out from between his eyebrows, and turned into an majestic Immortal Sword that appeared in his hands. The sword flashed with a dazzling light, and released a murderous aura in its surroundings. It was as if it could cut through thousands of worlds in the Universe!It was an ultimate soul-killing weapon![2: the one who sits inside the Temple and showed itself in the Manhua when he killed the Devil sent by Lin Trash.]\u2026\u2026Many people in the Inner Region of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family felt his surging aura when Gu Changge broke through to the Conferred King Realm. Although there were Formations to stop outside prying, they couldn\u2019t stop the oppressive might that erupted from his body like a thunderous wave of Great Dao intent. It was a fundamental change in his existence that couldn\u2019t be hidden from the world around him.\u201cChangge invites all the Family Elders to the Main Peak for a meeting!\u201dAfter that, Gu Changge\u2019s voice resounded in the sky above all the peaks of every lineage that dwelled in the Inner Region of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and attracted the attention of everyone. The Elders of the Family \u2014 who were busy in their own palaces and courtyards \u2014 couldn\u2019t help but frown.\u2018Gu Changge, just what are your intentions? Don\u2019t tell me you already can\u2019t hold back your desire for the Patriarch\u2019s position after making a breakthrough in your cultivation just now?\u2019Someone shook his head.\u2018What\u2019s the Young Master up to? How could he invite all the Elders to meet him like this?\u2019Many were shocked by his sudden words.\u2018Could it be about the position of the future Patriarch?\u2019Others couldn\u2019t help but guess.\u2026\u2026[In an extremely desolate part of the Land of Forsaken Immortals at this time.]Endless mountains covered in a wild atmosphere could be seen rising and falling everywhere. Chaotic mist surrounded everything, and gave the place an extremely ominous look. The terrifying auras of ferocious beasts surged towards the Heavens.However, if someone looked past all that, they would be shocked and left to wonder in awe.There was a small village that seemed to have come out of a fairy tale in this desolate and wild land!The population of the village didn\u2019t seem to be large, with under a thousand people living there altogether, but those who lived there weren\u2019t simple.At the same time, an incomparably magnificent peach tree stood at the entrance of the village. Colorful and radiant peach blossoms bloomed on the tree, and all kinds of Dao Truths circulated around it. It was as if the tree had stood rooted on its spot from the beginning of time, and even chaos couldn\u2019t move it from its place.\u201cSister Tao Yao[3], I am leaving this place\u2026\u201dA young girl in blue whispered to the peach tree\u2026[3: Peach Witch/Demoness/Devil in literal translation, but Sister Peach Witch doesn\u2019t sound as good as Sister Tao Yao. Wait, Peach Witch actually doesn\u2019t sound all that bad.][VILFIC: The Willow Tree and Bone-Digging Trope will be explained soon since the characters are showing up now.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMysterious Peach Village; Looking For Those With The Surname of Gu!There were many rumors about the Land of Forsaken Immortals in the Upper Realm. Some called it an abandoned land, others called it a cursed land, and some even called it a barren wilderness\u2026in short, the Land of Forsaken Immortals was an ominous place for the people of the Upper Realm, and not many were willing to step foot inside.Although divine lights would occasionally break out in the Forsaken Land, and people could chance upon some opportunities every now and then, most of the region contained more danger than treasures. Those below the Heavenly God Realm couldn\u2019t even think about crossing through this ominous region by themselves.Compared to other areas of the region that were covered by a ferocious aura, the small village sheltered by the towering peach tree appeared incomparably calm \u2014 just like a plot of paradise deep in hell.Of course, the village was named Peach Village, and many eccentric people resided therein.Right now, Gu Xian\u2019er stood under the peach tree. She was dressed in a blue dress, and looked extremely gorgeous with her heroic spirit and delicate and flawless facial features.The peach tree was the guardian spirit of the Peach Villain, and even her eccentric and mysterious masters respected the peach tree. Gu Xian\u2019er, however, had a great relationship with the peach tree. When she was young, she used to be a frail, sick girl, but the peach tree\u2019s essence cured her.To her, the peach tree was like a teacher and a big sister.\u201cAre you sure you want to leave? You are only in the Saint Realm right now, and that level of cultivation is nothing in the Upper Realm. Those descendants of the Immortals Sects and Dynasties are far stronger than you.\u201dThe leaves and branches of the peach tree swayed, and a pleasant, gentle female voice fell into Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s ears. Gu Xian\u2019er responded with a resolute nod and said, \u201cSister Tao Yao, I must leave this place! I have to find my grandfather, my parents, and the others from my lineage\u2026\u201d\u201cI have been separated from them for so many years, and don\u2019t know how they are doing? Back then, my uncle completely suppressed them and exiled them from the Family, so I am worried they might not be living a good life.\u201dRage flared in Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s eyes as she said this. Of course, she understood that even though her lineage was exiled, they were still better than ordinary Families and Races since they came from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. It\u2019s just that their life was certainly not as prosperous as before. Since they had been separated from the Power Center of the Upper Realm, they couldn\u2019t bring forth the might of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, nor could they stand at the top of the world like before.Besides, revenge wasn\u2019t her only purpose.She still had to find her grandfather and parents, and then work hard to bring glory to her lineage that had fallen into dire straits. She would let her uncle see and have a taste of their success!\u2018Of course\u2026the most important reason is my good brother from back then.\u2019Gu Xian\u2019er felt a dull pain in her chest as she thought of this. At the same time, the scene of Gu Changge digging out her Dao Bone resurfaced in her mind.He was too cruel!When she was young, she would always follow behind him, and cling to him all the time, but he ruthlessly dug her Dao Bone away! Every time Gu Xian\u2019er recalled this part of her memories, she would feel incomparable resentment towards her god-like, heartless brother.She had to avenge herself.\u201cThat is hatred between him and you, so you must avenge yourself with your own means.\u201dThe peach tree spoke again.Gu Xian\u2019er nodded at her words and said, \u201cSister Tao Yao, I understand that this is an internal matter of the Gu Family, so neither you nor the other masters will interfere.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good that you understand. Still, you don\u2019t need to worry too much. Although there are many strong beings in the Upper Realm, the ones that stand at the apex will surely not dare to attack you easily. Although your masters are eccentric people, there aren\u2019t many in the Upper Realm who dare to provoke them.\u201dThe peach tree\u2019s gentle and pleasant voice sounded again. Of course, she didn\u2019t mention herself as her origins were far more ancient and incomprehensible than the rest.\u201cI understand that, Sister Tao You! You and the other masters have treated me very well over the years. Not only did you teach me all sorts of things, but you also helped me understand the truth of the world; I can\u2019t express the gratitude I hold towards you.\u201dGu Xian\u2019er said. At the same time, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a burst of warmth surge through her heart.Different from her heartless brother, her masters in the village made her realize what it meant to have a warm place in the world.\u201cI can\u2019t help you much since this is your family\u2019s internal matter, and the same is true for your masters. At most, they can help you intimidate the big shots from taking action\u2026\u201dThe peach tree talked a lot today since Gu Xian\u2019er would be leaving soon. At the same time, a peach blossom fell from the many that adorned her body.\u201cTake this; it will be able to save you at a critical moment. If someone still recognizes it in the outside world, they will also give me face.\u201dThe peach tree spoke once more.\u201cThank you, Sister Tao Yao!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er\u2019s heart was moved as she took the peach blossom. The flower in her hand had seven petals, and each petal appeared to be carved from Immortal jade. They released an extremely ethereal and extraordinary brilliance.Gu Xian\u2019er naturally had no doubts about its ability since her Sister Tao Yao said that it could save her life, and felt relieved.Soon, she bid farewell to everyone from the village, and looked towards the direction of the distant-yet-prosperous region of the Upper Realm. Her eyes were full of yearning and heroic spirit.\u2018Before I left, First Master gave me a knife\u2026they said I should use it to deal with my brother if I can\u2019t defeat him fair and square\u2026\u2019\u2018Second Master gave me a rope that can tie up anything. If I can\u2019t defeat my brother, I can use it to tie him up\u2026\u2019\u2018Third Master\u2026\u2019\u2026\u2026Before leaving, Gu Xian\u2019er kneeled and prostrated before the entrance of the village, loudly knocking her head on the ground.\u201cEveryone, I will come back to see you after I\u2019ve settled my matters.\u201dFinished with her words, Gu Xian\u2019er brought along her old servant who had accompanied her from their Family back then, and turned towards the direction of the outside world. At the same time, a ferocious beast with a terrifying aura descended to take her away from the Land of Forsaken Immortals.Once she left, the group of her eccentric and mysterious masters appeared at the village\u2019s entrance and looked at her figure in the distance. All of them had weird appearances. Some were blind, others were dumb, some had broken legs, and others had no arms. At the level of their mighty cultivation, people like them could easily regrow a limb or two, but, for some reason, they didn\u2019t.Either they didn\u2019t want to, or they couldn\u2019t.Still, one couldn\u2019t deny the fact that all of these people came from shocking backgrounds. They would easily set a storm in the Upper Realm if they ever appeared in the Upper Realm\u2019s prosperous regions.If Gu Changge was here to see all of this, he would definitely curse the dog author and realize that his guess was right on point! The peach village had an extremely terrifying origin.[1]At this moment, all of these people busied themselves in discussion.\u201cThe daughter we raised for more than ten years ran away just like that! Just how long will it take for us to see her again\u2026\u201d\u201cThis grievance is between her and that brat, so we can\u2019t get involved. It\u2019s just that I am worried Xian\u2019er will suffer a lot outside since she\u2019s a kind and innocent girl. I can\u2019t understand how our bunch could raise a disciple with such a weak character\u2026\u201d\u201cCharacter doesn\u2019t matter! I think Xian\u2019er\u2019s personality is good enough!\u201dAn old woman with a withered face immediately retorted, and glared at the rest of the people around her.\u201cAlas! She was destined to be the darling of the Dao who would receive all the blessings and pampering of the world, but her blessing (Dao Bone) ended up pushing her down a spiral of hatred. I can\u2019t understand how her brother could be so cruel at such a young age, and do something so heinous towards someone like her?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s the reputation and upright conduct of the previous generations of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family on one side, and then there\u2019s a devil like this on another\u2026just what will become of their current generation?\u201dThe people stood outside the village and conversed with each other; they couldn\u2019t help but worry about Gu Xian\u2019er. Her leave made them feel as if the daughter they raised for more than a decade suddenly decided to leave some day, without telling them when she would return.They were like parents who couldn\u2019t help but worry about their child.\u201cI am afraid she will bring along a man the next time we see her\u2026I can\u2019t help but want to cut that man already!\u201d\u201cThis old man just calculated, and this doesn\u2019t seem to be impossible\u2026\u201dThe blind man in the middle suddenly felt a sharp pain between his legs.\u2026\u2026The Upper Realm was extremely vast, and it could be divided into three regions, namely: \u2018the Outer Region, the Middle Region, and the Inner Region.\u2019The division of the Upper Realm made it seem like a pyramid.The Inner Region was the most prosperous of the three, with endless territory, and countless major Heritages and Races. All the Supreme Immortal Families, Sects, and Orthodoxies were based in the Inner Region.The Middle Region \u2014 although not as resource-rich as the Inner Region \u2014 was also a prosperous region with a vast territory.The Outer Region, though not as prosperous and resource-rich as the Inner and Middle Regions, was still a place to behold in the Upper Realm. Many Heritages existed in it, and the relationships between the forces were extremely complicated.[VILFIC: the above sounds nonsensical, so I will put it in simpler terms: the Outer Region is an ordinary town, the Middle Region is a normal city, and the Inner Region is the Imperial City. Although they don\u2019t sound all that great if compared to each other, if they are placed next to the Lower Realm, it would be like comparing a rotten apple full of maggots with an Emperor\u2019s feast with gold leaves scattered over every spoonful.]The edge of the Outer Region was an extremely desolate place that acted as the junction between the Lower Realms and the Upper Realms. Those who Ascended from the Lower Realm normally arrived in this part of the Outer Region.This was also the place loved by the major forces of the Upper Realm, as all of them could capture free labor that could be used to mine or something, or they could find some good seeds with great talent. After all, if a cultivator who Ascended from the Lower Realm had a reasonably good talent, they could be trained as a force for their Heritage.Except for a few forbidden regions that no one dared to step foot in, and areas that had thin to no signs of Spiritual Qi, all the parts of the Upper Realm were filled with cultivators.[Xiling State, Outer Region]The Void trembled and Old Ming appeared in the sky out of thin air.\u2018According to the Young Master\u2019s command, the members of the Gu Family who were exiled back then should have come to the Xiling State\u2026\u2019Old Ming quickly searched through the region.The Outer Region was divided into various states with clearly demarcated borders, and each state spanned over millions of miles of territory. Heavenly Gods could easily reign supreme almost anywhere in the Outer Region, and there was no existence comparable to them in this State. As for God Kings? They rarely appeared in the Outer Region.Old Ming didn\u2019t do anything to hide his aura.[Boom!]The terrifying breath of the God King descended upon the region, and immediately alarmed all of the powerful people of the region about the arrival of the aloof and mighty god! The cultivators in the region couldn\u2019t help but tremble in horror.\u201cWhy is a mighty God King in a place like this? This aura is too terrifying\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the origin of this Senior?\u201dThe sudden appearance of such a mighty figure shocked and frightened everyone. Heavenly Gods could already look down on everything and anything in this place, so little needed to be said about beings at the level of God King.A single thought from such a behemoth could wipe out an entire major city!Soon, a group of Heavenly Gods with extremely respectful and awe-inspiring expressions rose to the sky. Since a God King had appeared in their Outer Region, he couldn\u2019t be here for nothing.\u201cDare we ask Your Excellency what we can do for you?\u201dThey asked with a submissive tone.\u201cAs commanded by the Young Master of my Family, I have come to search for people with the surname of Gu. Do you know where those with the surname of Gu are residing in the Xiling State?\u201dOld Ming questioned with a light tone.\u201cThose with the Gu surname\u2026\u201dGu Xian\u2019er, who had left the Land of Forsaken Immortals and was currently in a major city, couldn\u2019t help but tense up as she heard his words. She had just arrived in the Xiling State in search of the exiled members of her lineage, and never expected she would run into such a situation.Young Master?Gu surname?It had to be her \u2018dear\u2019\u00a0brother!Gu Xian\u2019er gnashed her teeth as the word\u00a0\u2018dear\u2019\u00a0ran through her mind.\u201cMy Lady\u2026\u201dThe servant behind her also showed a change in his expression.\u201cWhy did someone come knocking at our door as soon as I left the Land of Forsaken Immortals?\u201dGu Xian\u2019er appeared calm, but her brows couldn\u2019t help but furrow.She swept her glance at the red bird soundly sleeping on her shoulder. It was the mighty beast she took away from the Land of Forsaken Immortals, and used to hurry over here. Although it was strong, she didn\u2019t know if it could contend with a God King.Worse still? Her old servant was only in the False God Realm.Could it be that she would need to use the trump cards given to her by her master already?Gu Xian\u2019er decided to stay quiet and watch just what the heck was going on before she could act\u2026\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[FOOTNOTES][1: Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s Trope]Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s character uses two different tropes from two different novels, namely:\u00a0the bone-digging trope with the mighty tree as her backer + village in the wilderness with mighty, crippled masters hiding away from the world for unknown reasons.The bone-digging trope with a mighty tree was used in the novel\u00a0Perfect World\u00a0(translated by Pika on\u00a0WuxiaWorld). The Protagonist of Perfect World was raised in a village in the midst of a wild land, and a mighty willow tree stood at the village\u2019s gate. The willow tree was the guardian spirit of the village that had looked after the village since time immemorial. It\u2019s also known as Willow Deity.[ Introduction of Willow Deity by Lord-Ducky from Perfect World fandom: Willow Deity, an existence so mysterious that even the wiki doesn\u2019t know anything about it. All we know is that the amount of times it\u2019s foreshadowed to be the strongest existence ever is ridiculous. Moral of the story is don\u2019t f\u2022ck with trees.]As you can read in the chapter, the Peach Tree is the incarnate of the Willow Deity, and it\u2019s already foreshadowed as an extremely ancient and mighty being.The protagonist of Perfect World was born with a Dao Bone-like blessing in a mighty Clan in the world, but his cousin dug out his bone and stole it for himself. In the end, the protagonist somehow ended up in the Stone Village and was raised there.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014The\u00a0crippled masters hiding away from the world in a village in the wilderness\u00a0is a trope that was used in the novel\u00a0Tales of Herding Gods\u00a0(translated by Atlas Studios on\u00a0Webnovel). In the novel, a bunch of crippled old farts from the Disabled Elderly Village pick up a newborn kid from a village and raise with their blood, sweat, tears, and godly knowledge. They teach him all sorts of stuff about the world, with a not-so-good character (but that\u2019s kind of not true). These old farts are the Protagonist\u2019s backing, and the Protagonist gets a lot of opportunities through them (I won\u2019t spoil you here).\u2014 \u2014 \u2014You can read the novels or not, it\u2019s up to you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHave Her Fall in Love; Slap Y\u2019all to Death!\u201cYour Excellency, many people with the Gu surname came to the Xiling State a few years ago, but we aren\u2019t sure if they are the ones you are looking for? They are in the Qingshi Ancient City, and that city also has a God King residing in it.\u201dYoung Master?The Heavenly Gods showed even more respect when they heard his words.Someone who could make a mighty God King refer to them as their\u00a0\u2018Young Master\u2019\u00a0had to be someone with a terrifying identity, and could only be from a place like the Inner Region.\u201cQingshi Ancient City?\u201dOld Ming nodded. At the same time, his Spiritual Sense expanded and covered many nearby cities, and he quickly found the Qingshi Ancient City. Since it was a command from his Young Master, he would obviously do his best.\u2026\u2026What would an exiled lineage desire the most? Naturally, they would want to return to their Family.Although Gu Changge had yet to sit at the position of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s Patriarch, nor had his position as the next Patriarch been confirmed, that didn\u2019t stop him from doing something as minor as this.Gu Changge\u2019s plan was simple:\u00a0\u2018find a way to bring this lineage exiled to the Outer Region back to the Family!\u2019He did all of this because Gu Xian\u2019er was from this lineage, and not because he had suddenly turned into a Samaritan. Once the people of this lineage fell into his hands, he could use them as a threat if he found himself in dire straits.Although Gu Changge\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t all that sophisticated, it left no loopholes that others could use against him. The people of this lineage would have no choice but to thank him for his magnanimity, and even the Elders of the other lineages would have to keep their mouths shut and let him have his way, even if they knew his plan.Was Gu Changge doing something wrong?Obviously not!It\u2019s just that he suddenly felt\u00a0\u2018guilt\u2019\u00a0over his past actions, and wanted to bring back the lineage that was exiled because of him, so they could return to the Family and obtain their past glory.As for that lineage declining his good intentions?Gu Changge didn\u2019t believe they would do that. Back then, when their lineage was suppressed and exiled, most of the stronger members of their lineage were imprisoned in the Gu Family\u2019s dungeon. It would be up to Gu Changge whether he wanted to let them go or not after he became the Patriarch.Of course, the important point was that the animosity between them had yet to reach a point where it would turn into a blood feud. After all, they hadn\u2019t lost any lives back then. At most, they were exiled because of Gu Changge \u2014 they could hate him, but they couldn\u2019t hate the Gu Family as a whole.Besides, even they knew that his father had no choice but to do all that for the sake of his son.What\u2019s more? If the other lineages hadn\u2019t gotten involved and obstructed them back then, then that lineage wouldn\u2019t have just been exiled with their cultivations suppressed.Gu Changge understood all of this very clearly.The other lineages of the Family still hoped for the return of that lineage, so that lineage could also compete with Gu Changge\u2019s lineage like the others.The major lineages of the Family had existed for a long time together, yet the younger generation this time gave them such a scandal. The events of the past brought great pain to their hearts. It was good that no Ancestor had come out of the Ancestral Land, or Gu Changge couldn\u2019t imagine what would have become of him.No one knew when the Ancestors buried in the Ancestral Land would wake up and leave their coffins. All of those old fossils had violent temper, and even Gu Changge\u2019s father wouldn\u2019t be able to stop them unless he dug his own lineage\u2019s Ancestors from their coffin.This was another thorn that stood in his path to becoming the Gu Family\u2019s Patriarch, so Gu Changge had already figured out a solution to his problems.First, he had to solve the dangers hidden inside the Family. To become the future Patriarch, he would only need to lower himself a bit and promise some benefits to that lineage, and that should be enough to help him resolve the animosity they held towards him to a great extent.As for Gu Xian\u2019er? Gu Changge also had some plans for her.He recalled the past from around a decade or so ago, and remembered the little girl who was cut from a Heavenly Emperor\u2019s template following after him all the time. He felt that it would have been quite great if they were still like that.Unfortunately, the Original had already f!ck3d it up for him, so he had to find a method to resolve the hatred between them. After all, there was a life and death feud between the two of them, and it could only be solved if one of them died.Unless\u2026she could somehow forgive him?Gu Changge felt that wasn\u2019t too realistic.Who could forgive someone who dug out their bones?He couldn\u2019t be sure if that was viable unless he met Gu Xian\u2019er first. For now, the situation between them was that either he killed Gu Xian\u2019er, or Gu Xian\u2019er killed him.Killing her was troublesome, and he might not even be able to go through with it.Of course, Gu Changge would have no issues if it was a fair, one-on-one battle to the death, but he was worried that the monster standing behind Gu Xian\u2019er wouldn\u2019t give him that chance. The Gu Family wouldn\u2019t want to see something like that either.His current strength wasn\u2019t enough to take over the Gu Family without a shred of resistance from the other lineages.Gu Changge wasn\u2019t sure if his [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] would work against Gu Xian\u2019er. Back then, Ye Liuli and he were in the Lower Realm, so it was far easier for him to deal with her.As for Gu Xian\u2019er? Her backing certainly couldn\u2019t be worse than Ye Liuli\u2019s, and they were also in the Upper Realm now. Things will take a turn for the worse if his identity as the inheritor of Devil Arts was exposed before the one backing her.The Immortal Dao Heritages of the Upper Realm deeply resented Devil Arts, and the number of their Ancestors who had lost their lives at the hands of Devil Arts inheritors couldn\u2019t be estimated.Still, Gu Xian\u2019er was a girl, so Gu Changge reckoned that she might not be as troublesome to deal with as he thought. After all, he wasn\u2019t foreign to dealing with ladies.From the Original\u2019s memories, Gu Changge already knew that she wasn\u2019t too old, and should be at the age where girls started to develop their initial feelings of love and affection. He might not be at the top in other things, but his charm surely couldn\u2019t be doubted.If he couldn\u2019t kill her, or enslave her, then he could make her fall in love with him!That would be interesting, and he calculated that the feasibility of such a method wasn\u2019t all that bad.\u2026..[Boom!]Old Ming followed the command left to him by Gu Changge, and went to find the people of that lineage.With a God King in their ranks, they could easily strut around in these lands as the local emperors.The members of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family hadn\u2019t fallen to the point where outsiders dared to bully them.[1][1: if they were related to a boi protagonist, they would be living a pitiful life and any random Lu, Bu, or Chu would have been able to bully them.]Gu Xian\u2019er secretly followed Old Ming. She wanted to know just what her good brother was up to after they hadn\u2019t seen each other for a decade or so.The informants of the Gu Family in the Xiling State soon passed the information about everything that transpired back to the Gu Family in the Inner Region.\u2026\u2026[Ancient Immortal Gu Family, Upper Realm\u2019s Inner Region]Brilliant rays pierced through the clouds in the sky above the Main Peak. Many members of the family \u2014 including the Elders and Young Geniuses of the other lineages \u2014 could be seen standing together. Their terrifying auras surged towards Heaven, as if they wanted to bring down the world itself.It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that the people gathered here on the Gu Family\u2019s Main Peak could easily set off a storm in the outside world with just a stomp of their feet.They held exalted identities, and could easily alter the happenings in the outside world. One command from them, and the world wouldn\u2019t dare move to the East if they wanted it to go to the West.Many God Kings and Sacred Realm powerhouses appeared not too far away from the Main Peak as well. Unfortunately, they weren\u2019t qualified to set foot on the Peak, and could only watch the proceedings from afar.Right now, Gu Changge\u2019s tall and dashing figure was clad in white robes. Although his face showed indifference, it did nothing to conceal his elegance and handsomeness. The women from the various lineages couldn\u2019t help but sneak a peek at him every now and then, with their eyes full of brilliance. The Gu Changge in front of them was completely different from the indifferent and aloof man they used to see before.He resembled an Immortal untouched by the filth of the mortal world!Gu Changge\u2019s father also arrived at the scene. His features were shrouded by a hazy brilliance, and he sat on the head\u2019s seat like an ancient god who was looking down on plebeians \u2014 his aura alone left many breathless.Since his son had summoned all the Elders, he would naturally need to appear and support his son. What\u2019s more? He was also curious about Gu Changge\u2019s intentions.Right now, many Elders of the Family were staring at Gu Changge with a strange expression as they wondered just what medicine this brat was going to sell them now.[2][2: what flowery words he would use to trick them like a salesman.]Behind them stood the Young Geniuses of their lineages who were also famous and respected in the outside world (just like Gu Changge).\u201cNow that everyone who should have arrived is already here, I will begin. First of all, I am honored to see all of the Elders gather here today at my request.\u201dGu Changge said with a light smile. Right now, he was not as indifferent as he used to be, and his words were like a breath of fresh air. The Elders who understood his nature, however, didn\u2019t fall for his facade.They frowned and couldn\u2019t help but think,\u00a0\u2018Who would give a damn about you if you weren\u2019t your Father\u2019s son?\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t care less about their thoughts, and continued speaking, \u201cThe reason I gathered everyone here today is to discuss a major matter with all of the Elders; I believe that it is about time that we decide on the position of the future Patriarch!\u201dGu Lintian, who was sitting at the head\u2019s seat, was taken aback by his words, but he soon smiled. As expected of his son! He was direct and didn\u2019t mince his words.Of course, the most important thing was that he also wanted this matter to be settled as soon as possible. Why was it that Gu Changge, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, wasn\u2019t it\u2019s future Patriarch?To be honest, Gu Changge himself felt ashamed over this matter. After all, in the eyes of the outside world, his status as the Young Master meant that he was the future Patriarch of his Family!Still, Gu Lintian couldn\u2019t figure out how Gu Changge would go about dealing with this matter. He didn\u2019t think his son was a reckless man, and reckoned that he wouldn\u2019t do this if he wasn\u2019t confident in his means.The most important matter was that he must not reveal his Devil Heart.[\u2026]The entire Peak turned dead silent, and many of the Elders couldn\u2019t help but change their expressions.Had they heard him correctly?Did Gu Changge really call them here to discuss this? Did he forget that many Elders were still enraged at him over what he did back then, and there was no way they would give him any support?He was simply asking for trouble.The people in the surroundings couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads.\u201cChangge, I think we shouldn\u2019t be this hasty about this matter. The position of the future Patriarch holds great importance, and it can\u2019t be decided so arbitrarily. We have to responsibly consider a lot for our Gu Family before deciding on something this important.\u201dOf course, it was impossible for them to say that Gu Changge wasn\u2019t good enough to shoulder such a great responsibility.Right then, another Elder also added, \u201cWe need to make long-term considerations before discussing the position of the future Patriarch, so you don\u2019t need to say more, Changge\u2026\u201d\u201cThe position of the future Patriarch can\u2019t be decided so easily!\u201dExcept for the few lineages that were close to Gu Changge\u2019s lineage, all the others expressed their disapproval and tried to stall the matter.They would stall this matter as long as they could!Gu Lintian\u2019s face sank as he watched the scene in front of him. This bunch of Elders sure were audacious. No matter what, Gu Changge was already far beyond his peers in the Gu Family \u2014 the strongest among the others was only in the Conferred Lord Realm. Who else would be qualified for this beside Gu Changge?Gu Changge wasn\u2019t surprised at their reaction, and waved his hand towards his father to dispel his worry. The smile on his face showed no change, and the people in the surroundings still found his appearance to be like a spring breeze.\u201cI have gathered the Elders here to tell everyone that it\u2019s happening, not to ask for your opinion or a discussion on this matter. Of course, you are free to disagree, but don\u2019t I just have to beat your juniors one-by-one to receive your approval?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that written in the Family\u2019s law? In every generation, the position of the future Patriarch is handed to the strongest member of the Family, so you can\u2019t say I am breaking any law of the Family by doing this.\u201d\u201cSince you are unwilling to accept me as the future Patriarch, then don\u2019t blame me for bullying the weak.\u201dGu Changge said with a light smile and continued.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that might alone doesn\u2019t make one worthy \u2014 in this world, might alone makes right! Since I am stronger than your juniors, then it\u2019s only natural that I am more worthy than them.\u201dThe entire Peak turned pin drop silent!In the very next moment, the Young Geniuses standing behind the Elders exploded. Their faces turned livid and they couldn\u2019t bear such humiliation.Gu Changge\u2019s words were simple, but he was too damn arrogant!To put it simply, he was saying:\u00a0\u2018either I slap you all to death, or you can kill me\u2026oh, wait! You trash can\u2019t beat me.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He never expected Gu Changge to utter such arrogant words.No, this couldn\u2019t be described as just\u00a0\u2018arrogance\u2019\u00a0anymore. He clearly despised everyone and looked down on them; he didn\u2019t put the rest of the Gu Family\u2019s Young Geniuses in his eyes!Gu Changge\u2019s expression showed complete indifference that was in line with his remarks. He showed the onlookers what it meant to look down on others.Gu Changge had a simple and straightforward idea:\u00a0\u2018the Young Geniuses of the Gu Family might be afraid of him, but would they still not dare to fight against him if he egged them on?\u2019Since they were afraid of losing their qualifications to compete for the position of the future Patriarch by getting a beating from him, he would only need to gather them together and taunt them in their face.This way, they would certainly want to fight against him to prove who the strongest of the Gu Family\u2019s younger generation was. Surely, they wouldn\u2019t compromise on that.\u201cGu Changge, aren\u2019t you so arrogant just because you have a good father?\u201dA tall and heroic youth couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, and stepped forward with a livid face. He had a burly physique shrouded by a golden brilliance that resembled an armor carved from Immortal Gold \u2014 clearly, he cultivated an extremely terrifying Body Cultivation Art.He was a genius famous in the outside world, and not many could contend against him!Gu Changge swept a glance at him, and said with an unchanging expression, \u201cYou are the son of the Fourth Uncle, and your name\u2026you are Gu Chenxing, right? Do you dare say that again?\u201dGu Chenxing was taken aback by his words, and his rage flared. He was also a direct descendant of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, so how could he not dare repeat mere words?\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I dare? Gu Changge, aren\u2019t you so arrogant just because you have a good father?\u201dGu Chenxing repeated himself with rising rage.If Gu Changge\u2019s father wasn\u2019t the Patriarch of the Gu Family, would Gu Changge even be allowed to stand in this place after what he did back then? He would have long been exiled to who knows where!Gu Changge smiled at his words.\u201cI like what you said; I know all of you envy me for having a great father, but how is that my fault?\u201dHis words gave everyone another shock, and Gu Chenxing also showed a dull expression. Many of the Elders were dumbfounded, too. They had seen shameless people, but they had never seen such refined and eloquent shameless people. No wonder he committed such a heinous act!\u201cChangge\u2026\u201dGu Lintian coughed slightly. Although Gu Changge\u2019s words brought great comfort to his heart, saying those words in front of everyone would make it seem that he, the Patriarch of the Family, was biased in Gu Changge\u2019s favor.\u201cI will repeat my words: I have gathered the Elders here to tell everyone that I will be taking the position of the future Patriarch, not to ask for your opinion or a discussion on this matter.\u201d\u201cNow, my beloved brothers and sisters from the Family, either you take action against me and prove your ability right now, or take a U-turn from three miles away when you see me in the future! How is the offer? If you are afraid, then just get out of here.\u201d\u201cThe position of the Gu Family\u2019s future Patriarch isn\u2019t for trash like you!\u201dGu Changge\u2019s expression showed a perpetual calm.[VILFIC: dam that\u2019s cold!]\u201cGrandfather\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t stand it anymore! Let\u2019s do it! Gu Changge, don\u2019t think you can bully us! Who do you think is afraid of you?!\u201d\u201cThis guy is too much!\u201dTheir faces flushed.How could he utter such arrogant remarks with such a calm face?Gu Changge\u2019s expression could be said to be the greatest taunt. They wouldn\u2019t be so angry if he was simply uttering arrogant words \u2014 the problem was his damned expression that showed his indifference and disdain towards them as if it was only to be expected!This angered them so much that their spleens hurt, and intense rage flared up in their hearts.They were also from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and they were also Young Geniuses who had the qualifications to look down on others and strut around in the world unhindered. Who had they not fought? So how could they admit that they were inferior to someone?So what if Gu Changge was mighty?They usually avoided him for reasons, but now, he was stepping over their heads! Could they still back down? The time and effort they put into their cultivation would amount to fart if they did that!Many of the Family\u2019s people couldn\u2019t help but show helpless smiles. On ordinary days, the Elders would tell them to avoid getting into conflict with Gu Changge at all costs. They couldn\u2019t fight him right now when the position of the future Patriarch had yet to be handed down to someone.After all, the Family\u2019s rules were clear: *\u2019The strongest of the younger generation would become the future Patriarch.\u2019*Gu Changge\u2019s strength was naturally high above theirs. He had shown a terrifying talent and shattered uncountable records from his childhood.He held many titles such as: *\u2019Heavenly Talent, Incarnate of a True Immortal, God-Child, and so on.\u2019*It was a fact that everyone recognized Gu Changge\u2019s talent and might, and it stood to reason that everyone in the Gu Family ought to be happy at his existence.Alas! The incident of the yesteryear ruined Gu Changge\u2019s impression in the eyes of the Gu Family\u2019s senior management. He was already so ruthless at such a young age, so there was no way he could be a good choice as the Family\u2019s future Patriarch.If they could have it their way, they would make it impossible for Gu Changge to become the Family\u2019s future Patriarch!Gu Changge caused infighting in their Family, and didn\u2019t consider the overall situation and the Family\u2019s best interest, so how could they have a good impression of them?The Ancient Immortal Gu Family had hundreds of millions of people if they counted all the lineages, collateral family members, their dependent forces, and foreign retainers. What would become of them if someone like Gu Changge got to hold the reins of the Family?They couldn\u2019t imagine the outcome!Although Gu Changge was an extremely outstanding Young Supreme famous in all directions of the Upper Realm \u2014 and he was the first one who came to mind when the Supreme Heritages and Mighty Figures mentioned the Ancient Immortal Gu Family \u2014 his great image outside was maintained for him by the Family.After all, he represented the face of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family in the outside world.Now that they heard such provocative words from Gu Changge, they couldn\u2019t help but get enraged, and blue veins could be seen popping out on their foreheads.Even they didn\u2019t like Gu Changge\u2019s expression.Wasn\u2019t he telling them that they didn\u2019t dare let their younger ones fight against him because they \u2014 the Elders \u2014 were afraid of Gu Changge?Of course, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem if he only kept that to his heart, but now that he said it out loud, he was tearing all face.As Elders of the Family, their every move could determine the situation in the outside world, and right now, there were even a lot of people of their Gu Family watching from the sidelines.Could they bear it?Not to mention that they couldn\u2019t afford such massive loss of face, even the young\u2019uns standing behind them will suffer a deep setback. If they let this matter be and took a step back, then the losses would outweigh the gains.\u2018It\u2019s the first time I have seen Gu Changge using such means. If he didn\u2019t come up with it himself, then I would have believed that the Patriarch was the one guiding him from the shadows\u2026\u2019\u2018But looking at the Patriarch\u2019s expression, it seems even he was shocked by his actions, so he\u2019s certainly not the one who came up with this. It seems that Gu Changge no longer cares about maintaining facades with the rest of the family, and is finally revealing his hidden desires\u2026\u2019\u2018Today\u2019s battle seems to be inevitable, but that\u2019s fine as well! We can take this opportunity to probe Gu Changge\u2019s innate talent. Although he has always shown the Dao Bone as his innate talent, it is nothing more than a facade to hide the truth\u2026\u2019These thoughts went through the minds of various Elders.They had long been puzzled about this matter \u2014 just what was Gu Changge\u2019s innate talent?So many years had passed since his birth, yet no one knew about it. It was because of this that many of the Elders developed certain guesses in their hearts, and that was another reason they weren\u2019t willing to see the position of the future Patriarch fall into Gu Changge\u2019s hands.\u201cSince Changge has said so, you should try competing with him.\u201dImmediately, an old man said with an unsightly expression, and glared at Gu Changge as if he wanted to swallow him.\u201cChangge, everyone here is from the same family, so make sure you don\u2019t overdo anything\u2026\u201d\u201cIf something happens to my grandson, this old man will go to the Ancestral Lands and plead with the Ancestors to deal with your father and son\u2026\u201dMany other Elders also showed expressions of warning. They were worried that Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t show mercy, and might seriously injure their young\u2019uns.After all, everything was happening within the Family\u2019s rules, so they couldn\u2019t say much.Still, there was no one in the younger generation of the family who could be Gu Changge\u2019s match.His might couldn\u2019t be denied!Where else could they find a mighty Conferred King who had barely reached his twenties?Thinking about this, they realized that they were the only ones who knew that Gu Changge had broken through, and the other Heritages and Orthodoxies had yet to get the news. Of course, it could also be that the news just hadn\u2019t traveled far enough yet.\u2026\u2026\u201cPlease rest assured, Elders! Changge will certainly not go too far. It\u2019s just that all of you have been stopping me from taking the position of the future Patriarch for a while, so that\u2026\u201d\u201cIt has put me in a really difficult situation.\u201dGu Changge shook his head with a sad expression.The faces of the Elders couldn\u2019t help but stiffen, and they cursed the scheming bastard in their hearts. It was obvious that he was going to use this opportunity for revenge.\u201cI won\u2019t bully you, so all you can come at me together. I will suppress my Cultivation down to the Conferred Lord Realm\u2026of course, I can suppress it to the Saint Realm if that\u2019s what you want.\u201dGu Changge calmly said as he stared at his breathless and livid cousins who glared at him with fiery eyes. Of course, it would be a bit troublesome for him to deal with them without exposing too many of his aces if they really asked him to suppress himself to the Saint Realm.Still, he wasn\u2019t worried about that. After all, all of them were also Young Geniuses famous all over the world, and none of them were useless flowers raised in a greenhouse. They would obviously not take this provocation well.Sure enough, as soon as the Young Geniuses heard his words, they almost exploded out of rage. Even his female cousins, who would have graceful, fairy-like bearings on normal days, couldn\u2019t help but spew fire from their eyes as they grit their teeth and desired to bite his neck off.\u201cYou are too much! Gu Changge, I will teach you a lesson today!\u201dSword-like brows, starry eyes, and an awe-inspiring bearing\u2026Gu Changge immediately recognized him as his Sixth Uncle\u2019s son, who was at the pinnacle of the Saint Realm, and possessed an extremely mighty Innate Talent that gave a massive boost to his physical strength.Gu Changge simply straightened his body, and stood with his hands behind his back. Keeping his body upright, he kicked out, and his kick immediately set off waves in the Void in front of him.[Puff!]The Young Genius, who was rushing towards him, felt his knees soften and fell to the ground like a beaten dog without any ability to get up.\u201cHow did this happen\u2026\u201dHe showed a face full of confusion, and couldn\u2019t understand how Gu Changge kicked him to the ground even though he was standing so far away from him? No matter how great the difference between them, this shouldn\u2019t be possible.Just like him, everyone else around him also showed shock at the scene in front of them.\u201cIf I am not wrong, the Void just fluctuated, right?\u201d\u201cThis is the Void Talent\u2026\u201d\u201cSo it turns out that Gu Changge was hiding the Void Talent all this time!\u201dMany Elders were left in shock at the realization, and massive waves surged in their hearts. Void Talent, just like the Temporal Talent[1], was an extremely terrifying Innate Talent, and not many in the Upper Realm\u2019s long history were born with it.After all, these were two abilities that went against the Heavens![2]They never imagined that Gu Changge would be hiding such a talent!No, he might not even be hiding it. After all, Void Talent couldn\u2019t be perceived unless someone watched its holder use it in front of them.The Elders of the Family couldn\u2019t help but show complicated emotions. At one point, they had suspected that Gu Changge was born with a Devil Heart, so he was using the Dao Bones to cover that atrocity. It seems that their suspicion was completely off the mark.\u2018It seems that Changge came across quite a few opportunities down there.\u2019Gu Lintian was also surprised, and soon showed a smile. After all, Gu Changge\u2019s Devil Heart was the greatest threat to his life. But now, he had another terrifying talent to hide its existence.He felt even more reassured now.At the same time, Gu Changge glanced down at his cousin who was slowly getting back up on his feet.\u201cIt\u2019s just a friendly contest, so why are you getting down on your knees, brother? Even if you want to apologize, there\u2019s no need to kneel in front of me \u2014 I can\u2019t accept such kind intentions from you.\u201dSaying that, he kicked out once more.His cousin, who hadn\u2019t even gotten up completely, couldn\u2019t help but widen his eyes as he flew backwards and fell unconscious as soon as he fell. It won\u2019t injure him badly, but he would need to stay in bed for a while.The veins on the foreheads of the Elders moved even more violently as they watched this scene. In the entire Ancient Immortal Gu Family, only Gu Changge had the guts to do something like this right in their faces.\u201cAll of you should attack me together, and stop wasting my time. There\u2019s no way you will win against me in a one-on-one spar.\u201d\u201cThe position of the future Patriarch is at stake, and there\u2019s no way you will be able to take it away from me like this!\u201dSeeing that he had achieved his purpose, Gu Changge turned his gaze towards the rest of the Young Geniuses, and taunted them with a slight smile on his face that hadn\u2019t changed throughout their meeting\u2026\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[1: talent to control time. Space-Time Talent when?][2: if you can control time and space, you are essentially a god who can travel to the future or the past, and change reality as you see fit.]\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[VILFIC\u2019s Crib]The release schedule will be messed up for the next few days, until the First of February, at least, but you will get all your chapters.If anyone knows a good mobile app that lets you copy formatted text (bold and italic), then do tell me in the comments.

    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayProdigal Brat Turning Over a New Leaf; Blessing!Gu Changge\u2019s remarks easily provoked everyone, and everyone\u2019s rage flared. Now that it had come to this, they could no longer give a damn about whether their actions would be moral or not. They were also arrogant and proud Young Geniuses of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and it was because they were arrogant and proud that they could no longer bear Gu Changge\u2019s taunts.All of them took action together, and showed their terrifying Mystical Abilities to besiege Gu Changge.In their view, everyone should live in harmony as all of them were from the same family and grew up together. It was true that they bowed their heads and didn\u2019t dare provoke Gu Changge on normal days, but that didn\u2019t mean he could bully them like this.Not only that\u2026he just knocked someone down to the ground, and had the audacity to tell the victim that he didn\u2019t need to apologize to him! His actions almost made that cousin\u2019s father pass out.If Gu Changge\u2019s father wasn\u2019t the reigning Patriarch of their Family, his uncles would have surely given him a severe lesson to make him understand what it truly meant to bully the weak, without caring for whatever punishment they might have to receive afterwards.[Hum!]Everyone shot out together, and all sorts of Mystical Abilities and Treasures manifested on the Main Peak. Brilliant runes intertwined together, and a hazy brilliance permeated the surroundings, turning into mighty attacks. There were powerful Dharma Incarnates, invincible divine fists, and indestructible bodies\u2026A long whip flew towards him, a rain of swords fell upon him, and flashes of sword light flew across the sky to cut him to pieces. If all of those weren\u2019t enough, then even splendid, terrifying beasts appeared out of nowhere and pounced at Gu Changge. Even many mighty Conferred Kings would show a change in their expression if they were besieged by so many attacks at once.As the Young Geniuses of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, they could naturally not be compared to any random Lu, Shu, or Bu from the younger generation of ordinary Heritages. Many of them were already in the Conferred Lord Realm, while all of them were well-known in the outside world for their unparalleled might.Now that they were enraged and joined forces together, they naturally brought out their mightiest offensive power to suppress Gu Changge and slap him in the face. That\u2019s what they desired, and it was also just what Gu Changge wanted.The Void around him trembled, and, with a buzz, his figure blurred. Gu Changge\u2019s face still showed a calm expression \u2014 his figure, however, disappeared from his spot at breakneck speed. He was so fast that no rune could touch as much as the edge of his sleeves.One had to accept the fact that the power of the Void was extremely mysterious and mighty. Unless one had an extremely tyrannical Innate Talent that helped them move at godly speeds, or they possessed some divine Movement Technique, they would never be able to catch up to Gu Changge.As soon as Gu Changge disappeared from his spot, a group among the Young Geniuses felt that their offensive had failed, and that there was something fishy going on.Gu Changge wasn\u2019t stupid, after all \u2014 he would never take the combined attack of them all. His cultivation was suppressed to the Conferred Lord Realm, so he would certainly take the route that allowed him to easily take them down\u2026Right in the next moment, Gu Changge\u2019s figure appeared behind everyone. At the same time, the Void released terrifying fluctuations as blinding light shone above them, and a golden palm appeared in the sky. The palm kept enlarging, and one could even see extremely clear palm lines and fingerprints that made it look like the hand of a mighty god.It released deep and vast fluctuations in its surroundings.Naturally, it was a Mystical Ability of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family known as [Heavenly God\u2019s Palm].\u201cFall.\u201dAs if responding to Gu Changge\u2019s indifferent command, the golden palm suddenly fell from the sky, bringing along a terrifying momentum. It was as if it could destroy the stars, and pluck the sun and the moon.\u201cNooo! Back down!\u201dA group among the Young Geniuses reacted quicker than others. They knew the might of the [Heavenly God\u2019s Palm], and weren\u2019t willing to take its attack head on, so they immediately retreated. Alas! Gu Changge already saw through their intentions. With an unabated smile still on his face, he uttered, \u201c[Heaven and Earth Lock]!\u201d[Hum!]A terrifying force of confinement surged from the Void, and oppressive force of suppression filled every inch of space in front of him. This was the power of his Void Talent.[Puff!]The giant, golden palm fell with a bang and everyone\u2019s expressions changed. Some showed disbelief, while others resisted desperately. Alas! They could only take Gu Changge\u2019s palm attack head on, and spew blood as their blood and Qi went into disarray.Although Gu Changge\u2019s ability couldn\u2019t confine them forever, it was enough to hold them down for long enough. All of them lost within a moment. Their faces paled, and their heads hung low as an aura of gloom surrounded them.Adding salt to their injuries was the fact that all of this happened when Gu Changge had his cultivation suppressed to the Conferred Lord Realm, and wasn\u2019t\u00a0\u2018a mighty being bullying the weak.\u2019Even still, none of them could contend against him.Although they knew that there was a gap between them and Gu Changge, they never thought it would be so wide. Even though they were unwilling to accept this reality, it was still a fact that it was a one-sided beating.Gu Changge obviously wouldn\u2019t let them off with just this. His figure blurred, and he kicked them all to the ground with simple and swift whips of his legs.He shook his head, and said with a tone full of regret, \u201cYou sure are embarrassing! I gave you the opportunity to gang up on me, and even allowed you the first shot, but you didn\u2019t make full use of it. Do you still think you can compete with me for the position of the future Patriarch like this?\u201dHis remarks pierced their hearts like a sharp blade, and their skin turned bright red in shame. They were livid and unwilling, but the facts didn\u2019t care for their feelings.Even together, they weren\u2019t his match!What could they do now that this fact was haunting them? They didn\u2019t have skin as thick as him, so could they put the blame on him?At the same time, the Family members who were watching the debacle from the surroundings couldn\u2019t help but take a deep breath; they were shocked!As the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, Gu Changge\u2019s strength was, of course, above his peers as he was the face of the Gu Family in the outside world. But only now did they realize that they had underestimated him even still.He was so strong when he was suppressing his cultivation to the Conferred Lord Realm, so how freakish would he be if he were to go all out?Sure, there were many Young Geniuses in the Upper Realm who shone as bright as the stars, but they had no doubt that Gu Changge was the brightest star among them!They all turned silent!The surroundings turned dead silent once again!All the Elders of the Family felt their faces twitch as they watched Gu Changge easily suppress and beat down their Young Geniuses as if he was toying with toddlers. Their faces were as dark as the bottom of a burnt pot, and they didn\u2019t know what they could say at this moment.Everything happened too fast!In particular, they received a chance to gaze upon Gu Changge\u2019s clear ruthlessness. It was one thing if he just beat down their grandsons, but this demon didn\u2019t show mercy to their jade-like, delicate granddaughters, who resembled fairies on a normal day, either. This bastard trampled them down all the same, and they could see tears pool in their eyes.He didn\u2019t give a damn about anybody. He was ruthless, unfeeling, over the board, and a bully!Yes, he was a damn bully!They couldn\u2019t help but be pissed off at him!\u2018Changge\u2019s strength has improved by a lot recently.\u2019Gu Lintian didn\u2019t feel that Gu Changge had done anything wrong. On the contrary, he felt comfortable watching his son dominate everyone. After all, Gu Changge had always treated everyone except for his closest relatives like this.To him, most of his troubles would be resolved as long as Gu Changge got the position of the future Patriarch, and that was all that mattered.\u201cMy honorable Elders, do you have any more objections?\u201dGu Changge\u2019s expression still showed no change as he turned towards the Elders, and asked them slowly.He didn\u2019t believe they could say anything else now. Today, he beat down all the Young Geniuses from every lineage right in front of everyone, so there was no way anyone among them would dare bring up the position of the future Patriarch in front of him.As for the Elders? No matter how thick their skin might be, they would no longer be able to stall this matter anymore. The longer they tried to stall him from getting his rightful position, the greater the shame they would need to bear.Right then, several Elders who were close to Gu Changge\u2019s lineage stood up smiles and said, \u201cChangge, you are so mighty already! We have never had any objection to you becoming the future Patriarch, after all, you represent the face of our Gu Family in the world.\u201d\u201cThe stronger you are when you go out in the world, the stronger our Gu Family will be! All the other Heritages and Races of the Upper Realm already have their heirs, so how can our Gu Family\u2019s Young Master not sit at the position of the future Patriarch? Wouldn\u2019t we become a joke in the eyes of the world if this matter got out?\u201d\u201cThis old man thinks that there is no one more suitable for this position other than Changge. This old man won\u2019t feel well if Changge isn\u2019t accepted as the future Patriarch of our family\u2026\u201dAnother Elder added with a dignified expression.\u201cThat\u2019s not what you said before\u2026\u201dThe Elders with downcast faces couldn\u2019t believe this old man\u2019s shamelessness\u2026Everyone, however, was an old fox, and they understood that they couldn\u2019t put off this matter anymore. They sighed in their hearts, and wondered just what would become of their Ancient Immortal Gu Family in the future after they handed the reins to Gu Changge?After all, since times immemorial, all the lineages of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family had lived in harmony. Although there were occasional feuds and competition, those were only at the level of cursing each other for a while before they went back to normal as if nothing happened.What happened more than a decade ago truly hurt their unity. Although it hadn\u2019t damaged the Gu Family\u2019s roots by much right now, the impact it would have on their future couldn\u2019t be estimated yet.If a Family wanted to stand Immortal and reach higher grounds for eras to come, they would need to absolutely get rid of infighting!\u201cForget it! This old man is going into seclusion soon. As for what happens to our Family in the future\u2026you can deal with it yourself\u2026\u201d\u201cLintian, you are the one in charge of our Gu Family right now, and you are also in the prime of your life\u2026make sure you don\u2019t abdicate your position without reason, and enter seclusion out of nowhere.\u201dMany of the Elders were disheartened and left disappointed. Instead of seeing Gu Changge take over as the Patriarch and get command of everything, they hoped that Gu Lintian could continue to serve as the Patriarch as long as possible.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but shake his head as he heard their words. Did these Elders really think he was playing, and that the Ancient Immortal Gu Family would be brought to its ruin if they handed it over to him?Alas! There was nothing wrong with their thoughts if he took into account his Original\u2019s nature. After all, the Elders only wanted the best for their Gu Family.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t just tell them that he had a change of heart now, so their worries were unfounded, right? He wasn\u2019t stupid, and knew that as the Young Master of the Gu Family, he had to first find a way to bring the Gu Family to newer heights.Only some brain-dead freak would want to ruin their family.What he did today was purely to bring the Family out of their outdated thoughts and beliefs.Those Family members who were watching the scene from outside the Main Peak couldn\u2019t help but show emotional expressions. What happened today truly made them marvel at everything in their hearts. After all, Gu Changge\u2019s strength had already reached a point where not even the Elders could do anything to hinder his steps.With that, he was now truly the Young Master of the Gu Family. Although the title didn\u2019t change, the power he held in his hands was at a completely different scale.[This video is sponsored by\u00a0Pl4n3tSc4l3. Get Pl4n3tSc4l3 for a 100% discount when you\u2026\u00a0jk, or maybe not.]Right then, the disheartened Elders who were about to leave stopped in their tracks. They had just received news from their informants through voice transmissions\u2026news about the happenings in the Xiling State of the Outer Region of the Upper Realm.Old Ming\u2019s movements couldn\u2019t be concealed from them. Their Gu Family\u2019s enormous influence spread all over the Upper Realm, and they had eyes in every corner of the world. Although they spent all of their time in the world, they weren\u2019t blind to the events in the outside world.\u201cChangge, are you planning to bring back that lineage?\u201dOne of the Elders stopped in his tracks and asked with disbelief. They never thought they would hear that Gu Changge would send someone to bring people of that lineage back! Over the years, they had always been worried that Gu Changge might do something to slaughter that lineage, so they had kept their eyes locked on his every movement.But now, this reality stunned them all for a moment, and they felt as if they were watching their prodigal brat turn over a new leaf.\u201cElders, you don\u2019t need to worry about that matter anymore. Back then, Changge was young and ignorant, and did something heinous. As for this grievance? Changge will resolve it himself, and won\u2019t involve the rest of the Gu Family.\u201dGu Changge also restrained his expression after hearing his words, and said with a deep expression. His expression full of seriousness stunned all the Elders.\u2018Did the sun rise from the west today?\u2019They couldn\u2019t help but ask themselves that question.\u201cCan we trust your words, Changge? You wouldn\u2019t be tricking us and waiting to do something else, right?\u201dThe Elders stared at him with clear expectation in their eyes.Gu Changge replied with a nod, \u201cChangge knows what to do.\u201d\u201cGood, good, good!\u201d\u201cSince you say so, we will also believe you, Changge.\u201dIt was rare for them to see Gu Changge with such an expression, so they couldn\u2019t help but feel happy. If their prodigal kid really turned over a new leaf, then that would be a blessing for them!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBlame the Devil Heart; Full Control Over Myself!The people around the Main Peak started to disperse after the position of the future Patriarch was settled.There were countless Immortal mountains and islands in the Gu Family, and only those with high ranks in the Family were allowed to step foot on the Main Peak from the various lineages. Now that Gu Changge had become the future Patriarch, they had to announce the matter to everyone inside the Gu Family, and the forces that were affiliated with them!A matter as major as an Immortal Heritage selecting their heir could easily cause a sensation in the Upper Realm. Now, Gu Changge was the true Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and no one could point a finger at him.\u201cCongratulations, Young Master!\u201d\u201cYoung Master will lead our Gu Family to greater heights and an even brighter future!\u201dMany members of the Gu Family visited Gu Changge to congratulate him. In any case, Gu Changge\u2019s position as the future Patriarch was now set in stone. The terrifying might he showed at that time amazed everyone in the Gu Family. Even if they didn\u2019t mention anything else, Gu Changge\u2019s strength and talent alone were unparalleled.He deserved the position of their Young Master!Gu Changge accepted their gesture with a nod. All of this was within his expectations, except for the attitude of the Elders. He couldn\u2019t help but feel touched. This unity and magnanimity was one of the reasons the Ancient Immortal Gu Family could stall tall through eons!Although there were minor conflicts and frictions among the members of the Family, overall, they lived in harmony. They were completely different from the families he read about in the novels from his previous life, all of which were lost in deep struggles and infighting that wouldn\u2019t stop unless one side died.All of the Elders of the Gu Family put the Gu Family\u2019s interest above everything else. It was because of this that they didn\u2019t say or do anything when he, someone from the younger generation, stepped over their heads and arrogantly refused to give them any face.This brought great surprise to Gu Changge. But he felt that it wasn\u2019t all that impossible. If a family was full of scheming people trying to pull each other down, would it still be able to stand tall through the winding river of time? They would have long been ransacked and obliterated.Since they had handed over the future of the Gu Family in his hands, he would naturally do his best and make them flourish even more.Of course, he was only the Young Master right now, and the entire Gu Family was still in the hands of his father.\u201cChangge, follow me.\u201dGu Lintian said to Gu Changge with a gentle expression after everyone dispersed from the Main Peak. At the same time, a brilliant rainbow appeared under his feet, and he disappeared into the sky, leaving Great Dao lotuses blooming in his wake. He had gone back to the palace where he usually cultivated.\u201cUnderstood, Father!\u201dGu Changge nodded and followed. He knew that his Father had many questions for him, but he had already planned his words and actions. He was prepared for anything that came his way.Soon, the two stood face to face in the Patriarch\u2019s Hall.\u201cChangge, did you carefully consider the decisions you made today?\u201dGu Lintian mulled over his words, and then asked in a warm voice. He felt relieved now that the position of the future Patriarch was settled, but he knew Gu Changge\u2019s nature far too well. Unless it involved a threat to his interests, he would have never bothered with the position of the future Patriarch so early.It was for this reason that Gu Lintian wondered if Gu Changge had encountered some difficulty which prompted him into taking these actions?Gu Changge nodded to him in response, and said, \u201cOf course, this Child carefully thought about his actions. The position of the future Patriarch had to be settled, and it\u2019s a matter that couldn\u2019t be dragged out for long.\u201d\u201cSecondly, Father, you must have guessed my intentions if you are wondering about why I want to bring back Thirteenth Uncle\u2019s lineage.\u201d\u201cWhat happened back then was all my fault, and that incident left a thorn in the hearts of many people in the Family. If I hadn\u2019t resolved that matter, the others in the Family wouldn\u2019t accept me as their Young Master so readily.\u201d\u201cI decided to take advantage of today\u2019s incident to give face to the other Elders so we could ease the friction inside the Family. This will also help me become the Young Master without any more opposition.\u201d\u201cBesides, Father, haven\u2019t you always felt guilty over what happened to Thirteenth Uncle\u2019s lineage back then? One of the reasons I brought them back was to relieve those feelings of guilt in your heart.\u201dGu Changge explained calmly. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t say he wanted to use them to threaten Gu Xian\u2019er. Some things were better left to one\u2019s imagination. Although he was selfish, he still kept the Gu Family\u2019s overall situation and interests in his mind.Gu Lintian was momentarily stunned after hearing Gu Changge\u2019s words, but then a smile emerged on his face, and he said, \u201cChangge, it\u2019s good that you are thinking like that. I indeed feel sorry towards Brother Linxuan\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, you don\u2019t need to bear this burden alone. Your Thirteenth Uncle and the others won\u2019t let the matter rest so easily. Back then, it was I who took the shots at their lineage, so when they return from the world they are trapped in, I will make sure to protect you even if I have to lower my face or something\u2026\u201dThe Gu Linxuan he mentioned was Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s father. Back then, the two competed for the Patriarch\u2019s position, but in the end, Gu Lintian came out at the top by a small margin.His words touched Gu Changge\u2019s heart, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel moved. There was no need to say much as he already considered Gu Lintian to be his own father.He shook his head, and replied to Gu Lintian, \u201cFather, you don\u2019t need to say anymore. This matter started because of me, so it\u2019s only right that I bear the hatred alone without implicating anyone else. Besides, I was the one who persuaded you back then, and you did all that for me\u2026\u201dGu Lintian fell silent after listening to his words, and a complicated feeling rose in his heart. Gu Changge, who had always been indifferent and ruthless, suddenly said such words, so he couldn\u2019t help but have mixed feelings in his heart.How good would it have been if Gu Changge wasn\u2019t born with the Devil Heart?\u201cChangge, why are you suddenly saying such things? Are these your true thoughts?\u201dGu Lintian\u2019s expression turned serious as he said these words, and he stared at Gu Changge with deep eyes that showed visions of the Universe\u2019s destruction, fall of ancient gods, and such. He was like a Heavenly behemoth who stood at the pinnacle of the Upper Realm, with an unfathomable majesty.Now that he turned serious, his oppressive aura appeared as if it could destroy the world and tear open the dome of Heaven!\u201cFather, you must be wondering why I suddenly did all of that, right?\u201dGu Changge nodded with an incomparable calm.Gu Changge\u2019s current performance and actions weren\u2019t all that different in the eyes of the outsider \u2014 if one considered his past temperament \u2014 but to his close relatives, he was a completely different man.It would be better for him to say some words sooner rather than later.Right then, he asked his father with a soft tone, \u201cFather, you do know that I have a demonic nature, right?\u201d[Om!] OmOAs soon as Gu Changge\u2019s words fell, his eyes turned pitch black, and a deep, cold, and emotionless demonic aura spread around him.\u2018This demonic nature is too heavy\u2026this damned Devil Heart\u2026\u2019Gu Lintian sighed in his heart, and immediately locked the surroundings of his Island and palace to prevent anyone from detecting Gu Changge\u2019s devilish aura.He understood Gu Changge\u2019s meaning.\u201cThe rise of my cultivation base is increasing my control over my demonic nature\u2026\u201dGu Changge calmly explained.Of course, these words were said at random as he already had full control over his demonic nature. Still, since he had a Devil Heart, he could use it as a scapegoat for everything.\u201cYou used to be dominated by your demonic nature, right?\u201dGu Lintian felt depressed when he heard Gu Changge\u2019s words. In his opinion, the current Gu Changge must feel deep remorse over his past actions, and his conscience must be condemning him all the time.Alas! The Devil Heart was too weird and ethereal, and even he couldn\u2019t find any solution to do something about it.Gu Changge\u2019s ability to now control his demonic nature showed that he had been working hard on restraining himself over the years. Since he was dominated by his demonic nature, it was only natural that his temperament would become like this.\u201cFather, you don\u2019t need to worry about the Devil Heart affecting my reasoning and nature. What\u2019s more? It\u2019s existence helped me hone my Primordial Spirit and will\u2026\u201dGu Changge continued, and didn\u2019t forget to blame everything on the Devil Heart.\u201cYou have suffered much over the years.\u201dGu Lintian said with a sigh, but soon, joy filled his heart. The greatest knot in his heart was finally resolved, after all.After that, Gu Changge bid him farewell and took his leave.An expression of worry masked his face on his way back. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he had crossed over to this world long ago, but his mind had been dominated by his demonic nature right from the moment of his birth?Did he finally awaken his reasoning and memories of his past life because of the System?\u2018System, did you cross over with me?\u2019Gu Changge questioned the System.[That\u2019s correct, Host!]\u2018How long has it been since I crossed over to this world?\u2019[Twenty-one years, Host!]The System\u2019s response stunned Gu Changge \u2014 it was as he thought.\u2018Why didn\u2019t you turn on earlier then? Why didn\u2019t you help me awaken the memories of my past life sooner? I wouldn\u2019t be in such a troublesome situation if you had done that\u2026\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but question.[Host, do pardon me! I used up all of my energy when we crossed over, so I had been accumulating energy for the past twenty-one years.]The System responded.[Also, Host, please don\u2019t worry about your identity. The System\u2019s features were decided according to the Host\u2019s situation at the moment of initialization.][If the Host were a waste when the System initialized, then the System would have turned into a Waste\u2019s Counterattack and Life Altering System.][As for your Devil Heart? Its hidden dangers were also resolved by the System at the time of initialization, so you don\u2019t need to worry about it either, Host!]\u2018I never expected you to be so thoughtful, System. As expected of a transmigrator\u2019s Golden Finger\u2026\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but praise.He felt relieved now that he knew his own history.The greatest hidden danger to him was the Devil Heart, and it had already been resolved. Back then, his Original\u2019s mind was completely dominated by the Devil Heart, but the System\u2019s initialization had solved that trouble for him.It was also because of the System that his memories from his past life were unaffected. Indeed, for him, watching the memories of his Original who was dominated by the Devil Heart was like watching a movie \u2014 a movie starring an indifferent and cruel protagonist.It\u2019s just that he couldn\u2019t run away from the sins of his Original. After all, those were acts committed by his body.\u2026\u2026Gu Changge habitually opened his Attributes Panel after returning to his God-Child Island.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Host: Gu ChanggeHalo: Destined Heavenly VillainWeapon(s): Eight Desolate Demon HalberdIdentity: True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace | Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu FamilyBloodline(s): Devil Heart | Dao BoneCultivation: Conferred King (Initial Stage)Mystical Abilities:Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex [8th Layer]Myriad Changes Demonic Physique (Talent)Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple (Talent)Void Ability (Talent)Immortal-Devouring Demonic ArtInfinite Immortal Wisdom\u2026Destiny Points: 1000Fortune Value: 1000 (Dark)System Shop: OpenWarehouse:Domain-Traversing Talisman x1One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x3Fortune Plundering Card x3\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014The entire Attributes Panel had a brand-new look.

After that, he took out the [Deity-grade Soul Nourishing Jade].\u201cYan Ji\u2026\u201dYan Ji, who was dressed in red and sitting cross-legged inside the void, immediately turned into a wisp of crimson smoke and appeared from the [Soul Nourishing Jade].\u201cYoung Master\u2026\u201dHer voice sounded cold yet pleasant to the ears. As soon as she appeared, an expression of confusion appeared on her face as she wondered why she was in an unfamiliar place. Just one glance at her magnificent and majestic surroundings was enough to let her know that the Heritage this place belonged to had a deep and terrifying background.She had spent all of her time cultivating her Primordial Spirit over the last period of time. Either way, because of the restrictions of the [Spirit Nourishing Jade], she couldn\u2019t sense the world outside the Jade, so she didn\u2019t know that Gu Changge had already returned to the Upper Realm.Gu Changge looked at her and said with a slight smile, \u201cThere\u2019s something I need you to do for me.\u201d\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[SLAVE-tan\u2019s Crib]TL;DR at the end.Hello, everyone!I wanted to inform you that I am not very sure on whether I can churn all 17 chapters for this week as I have been trying to work overtime to get my IRL job\u2019s project done before February so that the schedule for February doesn\u2019t get messed up.

    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI Desire Your Body; Reality Different From Imagination!\u201cYoung Master, you don\u2019t need to be polite with Yan Ji \u2014 you can give me your command without any hesitation.\u201dAlthough Yan Ji was still confused about their whereabouts, she still hurriedly responded to Gu Changge after hearing his words. She had already been feeling guilt and unease over not having any way to repay Gu Changge\u2019s favor, so now that she heard Gu Changge\u2019s words, she couldn\u2019t help but heave a sigh of relief.She didn\u2019t think she was worthy of having someone with Gu Changge\u2019s identity take care of her without getting anything in return.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing big, actually. Before that, let me help you reconstruct your body.\u201dGu Changge said with a smile, and looked at Yan Ji\u2019s somewhat transparent figure. After all, Yan Ji was a Great Sacred Realm master at her peak, so Gu Changge would feel more at ease if he could have someone as mighty as her around to take care of some matters that couldn\u2019t be divulged.He wasn\u2019t worried about Yan Ji betraying him. When they were in the Lower Realm, he already got to experience her nature, and believed that she was a person who could be trusted.\u2018Reconstruct my body\u2026\u2019Yan Ji\u2019s scarlet pupils trembled as she heard his words, and a dazed expression appeared on her face. She had always wondered when the day would come when she would be able to reconstruct her body. No matter how she thought about it, she believed that it would take her a long time to see that day.Back when she woke up and found herself in the wildernesses of the Lower Realm, she decided to not even think about this matter anymore, and could only wait and wait and wait.At the time when she took Ye Chen in as her disciple, the thought to have him help her find some Heavenly Treasures to reconstruct her body had indeed crossed her mind. Alas! Ye Chen was simply too weak, so she could only kill her ideas in the cradle. In the end, she decided to just repay Ye Chen\u2019s grace for awakening her by teaching him until the day her remnant spirit dissipated.But fate was strange, and she somehow ended up with Gu Changge.The dream that was once unreachable to her was something that Gu Changge could help her achieve with a mere few words. This massive shift in fortune brought great unease to her heart for a while, but then she felt blessed. If Ye Chen hadn\u2019t misunderstood her due to his unfounded suspicions, and ended the relationship between them, then she would still be in the Lower Realm, waiting for the day she would disappear.With that said, she wondered if she was in a dream right now?\u2018Why is Young Master Gu so good to me?\u2019Yan Ji\u2019s ruby eyes shone brightly and stared at Gu Changge without blinking as this thought crossed through her mind. Helping her once could be explained as generosity, but how could his act of helping her again and again for nothing be explained?What\u2019s more? Gu Changge had an esteemed identity, and he was the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. She was sure that they had also already returned to the Upper Realm. After all, judging from the luxurious decorations in the palace, and the surging Spiritual Qi that seemed to be flooding her surroundings, plus the brilliant light from the treasures\u2026No ordinary power could bring out something of this level.Just her surroundings were enough to show the grandeur and horror of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s deep heritage.She couldn\u2019t help but be startled.Yan Ji was not stupid, so she couldn\u2019t help but have these thoughts. Just why was Young Master Gu going this far for her? Had he taken a fancy to her strength? Or was he interested in her background and past?That couldn\u2019t be! There was no shortage of talented and mighty people in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. Although her origin was relatively special, it meant nothing in front of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.As for him fancying her? She didn\u2019t quite believe that. Although Yan Ji was confident in her appearance, the one in front of her was the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family who wouldn\u2019t lack beautiful women willing to stand at his beck and call. Just one sentence from him would be enough to make innumerable favored daughters of Heaven send themselves to his bed.This left Yan Ji confused.Was he doing it purely out of the kindness of his heart? No matter how she thought about it, that couldn\u2019t be the case. After all, a Young Master like Gu Changge would have to be an extremely ambitious and ruthless person who would only do something if it brought him some benefit.[1][1: this is her thinking in a general term as people from such massive families can\u2019t be kind and gentle with outsiders. They eat, sleep, and speak benefits.]\u201cYoung Master\u2019s kindness to me is already as heavy as a mountain, so let\u2019s forget about reconstructing my body. Yan Ji wouldn\u2019t know how to repay your favor anymore\u2026\u201dAlthough Yan Ji was extremely excited about rebuilding her body, she still shook her head and refused. She had her own morals, and wouldn\u2019t accept his grace unless she had a way to repay Gu Changge.Gu Changge wasn\u2019t surprised by her response. There would be something wrong with Yan Ji if she readily accepted his offer.His face still showed a slight smile, and he asked with an expression of intrigue, \u201cWhy? Shouldn\u2019t reconstructing your body be a good thing? This should have been your plan and goal all along, right? Or do you not feel well achieving something so big if it doesn\u2019t bring along a sense of accomplishment?\u201dHe chuckled and teashed her.His words stunned Yan Ji, and she couldn\u2019t help but feel somewhat indignant. What did he mean by saying that she didn\u2019t feel well because there wasn\u2019t any sense of accomplishment in achieving that?Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to say anything right now.Had she followed Ye Chen, she would have never been able to have a chance to rebuild her body, but after she joined Young Master Gu\u2019s side, only a few words from him were enough to help her reconstruct her existence.Sure enough, some people were born different and couldn\u2019t even be compared. What some pursued all their lives, others were born with that in the palm of their hands \u2014 everything was within their reach. This reality complicated her mood even more.In fact, a part of her was worried about Young Master Gu despising her somewhat since she once stood at his opponent\u2019s side, but, in reality, Gu Changge didn\u2019t care about all of that, and she understood this well.This had moved Yan Ji\u2019s heart much.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have my own reasons for helping you rebuild your body, so you can accept my help without thinking so much into it.\u201dGu Changge said with his unabated smile.\u2018Women, once their hearts were moved, couldn\u2019t let go.\u2019This sentence was true, whether it was in his past life, or in this world.Of course, the reason he subdued Yan Ji was because he took a fancy to her Fortune Value.Would you kill a chicken after getting its egg, or keep it around to have it lay even more for you?The answer to that question was obvious.What\u2019s more? Yan Ji was a mighty master. Right now, the strongest person Gu Changge could command was Old Ming; the Gu Family would never send retainers who were too powerful to serve the younger generation, or they wouldn\u2019t be able to grow\u2026Gu Changge required strong retainers.\u201cThen, what are Young Master Gu\u2019s reasons?\u201dHis words gave birth to curiosity in her heart, so Yan Ji couldn\u2019t help but want to know.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to ask about such a simple matter? It\u2019s because I desire your body\u2026\u201dGu Changge stared into her beautiful eyes and said with a chuckle. His words stunned Yan Ji, and her head buzzed.\u201cYoung Master Gu, you are so annoying. Please don\u2019t say that again\u2026\u201dYan Ji glared at him with some anger. She had never expected such an answer from Gu Changge. To begin with, what kind of answer was that? He desired her body, so he wanted to help her reconstruct it?Yan Ji felt her heart thump faster and faster. If some random fool had said this to her, she would have slapped that person with her frosty palm without hesitation. But when Gu Changge said that to her, her head buzzed and her face burned.He must be joking!How could Young Master Gu desire her? That couldn\u2019t be possible!\u2026\u2026[Outer Region of the Upper Realm, Xiling State.]Gu Xian\u2019er hid and watched the proceedings in secret. The little bird on her shoulder had already grown in size, and chased after the old God King Realm figure dressed in black, while carrying Gu Xian\u2019er and her servant on its back. The words of the old man were enough for her to guess that he was a servant sent by her good brother.He had a God King as his servant!It showed just how well her good brother was living over the past decade, and just how monstrous his authority had gotten. Gu Xian\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but clench her hands, and resent Gu Changge even more, as these thoughts crossed through her mind.She worked hard and arduously cultivated in the Peach Village, but even after receiving guidance from several mysterious and mighty masters, she was only in the Saint Realm right now. He, on the other hand, could easily obtain resources and power while sitting in the comfort of his home, and she reckoned that his cultivation was even more unfathomable than she had imagined.\u2018No, I will not give up! Sister Tao even said that she had never seen someone with a foundation stronger than mine. I can\u2019t be weaker than Gu Changge! I will take back everything he stole from me in the future!\u2019Gu Xian\u2019er clenched her hands, and followed the old man in black in front of her. She had a lot of treasures on her that could hide her presence, so she wasn\u2019t worried about the old man discovering her.What she wanted to know was why Gu Changge sent the old man to find her lineage? Did he want to slaughter them all? Gu Xian\u2019er bit her lips as she thought about this, and gnashed her teeth as a hateful expression appeared on her flawless, delicate visage.\u2018My dear brother, I never thought you wouldn\u2019t let me go even after so many years\u2026\u2019But soon, she suppressed the rage and hatred in her heart.\u2018With me here, no one can touch my family!\u2019Gu Xian\u2019er proclaimed in her heart.\u2026\u2026[In the sky ahead of Gu Xian\u2019er.]Old Ming didn\u2019t know someone was secretly following him. He had only come to this place on the order of his Young Master, and his only job was to find the people of the Gu Family to bring them back to the Inner Region of the Upper Realm.As for what the Young Master didn\u2019t order? He couldn\u2019t care about those.Before long, Old Ming found the majestic ancient city where the Gu Family\u2019s lineage resided. The city was extremely lively and awe-inspiring, with various Families, Sects, and innumerable cultivators in the millions residing and moving about.Suddenly, he showed a gentle smile, and got rid of his arrogant aura. Although he was sent by his Young Master, he reckoned that it would be better for him to not show any arrogance here. After all, the Gu Family lineage that now resided here was once one of the most powerful lineages of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.[Boom!]Soon, his God King aura descended upon the ancient city below him. At the same time, Old Ming\u2019s clear voice resounded throughout the city.\u201cAt the command of the Young Master, I have come looking for those with the surname of Gu!\u201dHe believed that his words would be enough to convey his message to the ones whom it concerned.[Boom!]Right after Old Ming revealed his mighty aura, the entire ancient city went into chaos, and all the cultivators inside it were shocked.How come a mighty God King came to their place?And why was he looking for the people with the surname of Gu?The cultivators knew that their ancient city was indeed controlled by those with the Gu surname, and that they were the absolute overlords of this place. Now, they wondered just who the God King in black might be, and why he appeared here out of nowhere?Also, who was this Young Master he was talking about?Everyone in the city was shocked, and they felt that something big was about to transpire.At this moment, several strong and dignified old men looked towards the city\u2019s periphery from inside their magnificent complex of buildings.\u2018I never thought Gu Changge would come for us after so many years of peace and tranquility! But how come he only sent one God King to deal with us? Is he looking down on us, old bones?\u2019They showed an expression of rage and gloom. After all, as long as they heard the words\u00a0\u2018Young Master\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018Gu surname\u2019,\u00a0they could easily tell just who the other party was talking about.For that reason, they subconsciously thought that Gu Changge had sent someone to murder them.\u2018Has the situation in the Family degraded to such a point already? Are the other Elders no longer around, or does Gu Changge no longer give a damn about their existence?\u2019\u2018I never thought that after protecting us and stalling Gu Changge for so many years, the other Elders finally can\u2019t do anything against him! It seems that today\u2019s the day we\u2026\u2019Their expressions turned ugly as they made different guesses.At the same time, the voice of the old man outside the city sounded once more, \u201cThe Young Master has sent this old slave to pick all those with the Gu surname to bring them back to the Family!\u201dThey were left in a daze the moment they heard his words. How come reality turned different from their imagination?He was here to bring them back to the Family?What was going on?They had been in exile for so many years, and now someone was here to take them back to the Gu Family\u2026they had to accept that this was something they had never expected, so they couldn\u2019t help but be shocked\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were prepared to fight off the old man, but the old God King\u2019s words turned out to be completely out of their expectations.\u201c Could there be a conspiracy?\u201d\u201c What if he\u2019s pretending to be here to bring us back to the Family, but after we leave with him, he will secretly put us to death in some corner of the Upper Realm?\u201dThe people of the exiled Gu Family lineage showed puzzled expressions, and couldn\u2019t help but frown. They wondered just what Gu Changge was plotting.\u201c I want to see just what medicine this Gu Changge is selling now.\u201d\u201c Yeah, no matter how inflated his guts, he wouldn\u2019t dare attack us in the open like this.\u201dAlthough they were excited about returning to the Family, they weren\u2019t stupid. They couldn\u2019t help but feel that there was a conspiracy hidden behind this action.[Buzz!]Within moments, the people of the Gu Family\u2019s exiled lineage appeared from their residences and flew out of the city. Although their cultivation bases were sealed, and they couldn\u2019t bring out the true might they held at their peak, they still showed a deep majesty that came to them naturally after living at a high position for a long time.The cultivators and creatures of the entire ancient city were shocked when they watched the scene. The Upper Realm\u2019s Outer and Inner Region were simply too far apart, and there were more planets and realms between them then there were grains of sands beside in an ocean.It was because of this that few had associated those with the Gu surname in this city to the monstrous behemoth known as the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.This was an incredible realization!\u201c Were you sent by Gu Changge?\u201dA middle-aged man with a flat expression and prestigious aura stared at Old Ming and asked.\u201c This old slave was indeed sent by the Young Master. The Young Master will be the one taking charge of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and I have come at his command to bring everyone here back to the Family.\u201dOld Ming responded. This was what Gu Changge had told him to say.To be honest, Old Ming didn\u2019t know for sure why this lineage of the Gu Family was exiled all the way out here. After all, he couldn\u2019t even enter the Gu Family\u2019s Inner Region, and was nothing more than a mere servant. Still, he did indeed hear some rumors about what happened a decade or so ago, but that matter was a taboo in the Gu Family. For that reason, he made sure to not think about it, or utter anything regarding that matter.\u201c He will take charge of the Family in the future? Heh! So he doesn\u2019t consider our lineage a threat to himself anymore?\u201dThe middle-aged man sneered. Could an omnivore really turn over a new leaf and eat leaves?The others also remained calm, and didn\u2019t show much excitement at his words.Old Ming spoke up again, \u201cThe Young Master has said that he will give justice to your lineage. As for whether you believe it or not, it doesn\u2019t matter to him. Although the Outer Region of the Upper Realm is vast and comfortable, can it compare to the Family\u2019s domain? The Young Master indeed wants to bring you back. Other than that, he said that he might also consider letting go all of his Uncles who were locked in the Family\u2019s dungeon back then. \u201dOf course, every word Old Ming said was prepared by Gu Changge, and he, himself, didn\u2019t have the guts to utter such words of taboo related to the Gu Family otherwise.\u2018Can a devil like him really turn over a new leaf and know how to correct his mistakes?\u2019The middle-aged man was taken aback by Old Ming\u2019s words, but couldn\u2019t get rid of his skepticism.He couldn\u2019t believe that someone like Gu Changge could have uttered those words.As for there being some other conspiracy?He wasn\u2019t all that worried. Although the Gu Family had innumerable members, he believed that only someone like Gu Changge would have the thoughts of killing someone from the same family.\u00a0[and since the other members were still around, Gu Changge shouldn\u2019t have the guts to take such drastic actions.]The other members from the lineage couldn\u2019t help but be confused right now, and discussed the matter in suppressed voices. It was the continuous suppression from Gu Changge\u2019s lineage that had forced them all the way out to the Outer Region of the Upper Realm.After they lived in the Outer Region for a while, they had gotten used to it, but if they had to be honest, then the Outer Region was a desolate land where even birds wouldn\u2019t want to shit. Of course, that was their opinion, and to them, returning to the Family was something they were very willing about.It\u2019s just that they couldn\u2019t figure out why Gu Changge was doing this all of a sudden now?\u2018Wait, all of this must have been forced by the other Elders of the Family! Otherwise, they would never let Gu Changge take charge of the Family with his ruthless nature.\u2019Soon, this thought crossed their mind, and they sneered. This made more sense. Gu Changge wanted to take charge of the Gu Family in the future, but the Elders refused to accept him as the future Patriarch. In the end, with no other way, he was forced to come up with such a compromise to get the agreement of the Elders.They could return to the Gu Family, while Gu Changge would get the position of the future Patriarch!Old Ming didn\u2019t know their thoughts, nor did he know about the intricacies of the Gu Family\u2019s internal matters. Gu Changge, on the other hand, had long expected these people to have such thoughts and guesses, and prepared his (Old Ming\u2019s) words for him.\u201c Everyone will obviously know the truth when all of you return to the Family. What good will showing such suspicions right now even do?\u201d\u201c Surely, you wouldn\u2019t be thinking about letting the Elders\u2019 compromise go to waste, right?\u201dThe middle-aged man and the others were moved when they heard his affirmation, and could barely hold back their excitement.Once they returned to the Gu Family, Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t dare to attack them at will unless he went insane and no longer cared about the others in the Family, and wanted to tear it apart from its roots.Gu Xian\u2019er, who was hiding somewhere and watching all the events, was left rooted on her spot in a daze. Everything that happened was completely different from her expectations. She had thought that the old man in black was here to kill the people of her lineage, but when he said that he was here on Gu Changge\u2019s orders to pick them up to bring them back to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, she was stunned just like the rest.Subconsciously, she also thought that there was a conspiracy!But when she got closer to the scene, she saw the gentle and polite expression of the old God King, and found that he didn\u2019t seem to be faking his expression.Just what had happened in their Ancient Immortal Gu Family?Since when did Gu Changge become so kind?Could someone like him really send a servant to do something like this?She couldn\u2019t believe something like this to be real. Her beloved elder brother was a cruel and indifferent man who probably couldn\u2019t wait to kill her and everyone in her lineage.She could see that it was all thanks to the Elders of the Family that her lineage was doing so well in the Outer Region over the past, and it had nothing to do with Gu Changge.\u2018I want to see just what kind of concoction Gu Changge is selling now! He can\u2019t be this kind for no reason.\u2019\u2018For now, I can\u2019t show up. Since everyone is alright, I can leave in relief.\u2019Gu Xian\u2019er decided not to show up, but also didn\u2019t leave right away. Only when all of the people of her lineage left did she also quietly leave the ancient city. Before she left the Peach Village, one of her masters had given her a token and asked her to go to the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace to find its Great Elder.The Great Elder of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace could be said to be the Upper Realm\u2019s most terrifying existence, but he owed her Master a favor from long ago.The Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace was a famous Ancient Immortal Heritage of the Upper Realm, with a deep history. Many Dynasties, Noble Families, and Immortal Heritages would send their descendants to cultivate in the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace.It was said that the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace was related to True Immortals from the most ancient time of the Upper Realm, and possessed many Immortal Scriptures and Inheritances.Her cultivation base was still too weak, so she had to work hard if she wanted to challenge her good brother to regain everything!\u2026\u2026[Inner Region of the Upper Realm, Ancient Immortal Gu Family.]Gu Changge was on his God-Child island right now. The entire island was covered by an Isolation Formation that could stop the prying of anyone from the outside. No one except for him could enter his Island without permission.An ethereal figure sat cross-legged in a pond surrounded by celestial mist, and filled with Spiritual Qi and divine brilliance.The water of the pond glittered with brilliant rays of light. Red flames swirled above it, while black, red, and gold rays of light mixed together to create an extremely breathtaking scene. Innumerable other colors also shone brightly in the surroundings, giving birth to a rainbow with infinite colors.All kinds of rare materials such as Divine Herbs that had matured for hundreds of thousands of years, Sacred Ingredients, Spiritual Liquids, and the like kept turning into streams of divine Qi before pooling together into the pond.The entire place looked like a plot of land that had come right out of a fairyland!If an Alchemist were to see the scene at this moment, they would surely feel their heart\u2019s ache, and curse Gu Changge for wasting such Heavenly materials in such a way. Just a small piece of any item here required massive resources and hard work to find in the outside world. Even grabbing them for a high price at an auction wasn\u2019t easy.Soon, the visions receded, and a terrifying and majestic aura started to permeate the surroundings. First came the aura of the Sacred Realm, and then the aura surged and broke through to the Great Sacred Realm in one go![Splash!]Accompanied by the sound of water splashing around, Yan Ji walked out with surprise and stars in her eyes.\u201c Young Master!\u201dA smile bloomed on her face as she immediately found Gu Changge standing not too far away from her, and called out to him in her cold-yet-joyous voice.Gu Changge nodded to her with a slight hint of appreciation in his eyes.\u201c Not bad.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t wasted all those resources. Her body was perfectly reconstructed, as if she were a fairy from the Ninth Heaven, and he couldn\u2019t find a single flaw in her appearance. Her flesh glistened like Immortal jade, while wisps of golden-red flames jumped above her hair.The only words Gu Changge could use to describe her were\u00a0\u2018charming\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018flawless!\u2019\u201c Young Master Gu, do I look good?\u201dYan Ji spun in front of him at the same time as she asked. A bashful expression could be seen on her face, after all, this was the first time she showed herself in flesh and not as a remnant spirit.Gu Changge smiled, and replied, \u201cYou are very pretty.\u201dYan Ji\u2019s smile showed even more happiness as she heard his response, and even her eyebrows jumped in joy.\u201c But don\u2019t you feel cold?\u201dGu Changge continued, and asked.\u201c What?\u201dHis words stunned Yan ji, but she soon realized what he meant, and reacted. She had just reconstructed her body, and was no longer a remnant spirit, so there was obviously nothing covering her figure after she reconstructed her body.Not only was she completely naked right now, but she even spun around right in front of Gu Changge without a thread covering her body!Her face turned as red as a tomato, and she squatted and curled like a cooked shrimp.At the same time, Yan Ji saw Gu Changge\u2019s playful expression and felt even more ashamed.It was too shameful!Still, Gu Changge had no intention to tease her anymore. He took out a white robe and put it around her. He would have other opportunities in the future, but for now, he needed her to take care of some matters. With her strength of the Great Sacred Realm, she could explore certain places for him.\u201c Thank you, Young Master!\u201dYan Ji wasn\u2019t an ordinary girl either. She had cultivated for countless millennia, so she soon calmed down. Still, she felt her face burn a little.\u201c I want you to go outside and take a look at the Land of Forsaken Immortals. Go and see if there\u2019s any special place hidden in the depths of that land. Make sure to contact me if something comes up.\u201d\u201c Take this [Domain Traversing Talisman] with you. Use this if you come across an opponent you can\u2019t deal with. Make sure you don\u2019t hesitate in using it \u2014 your life is the most important!\u201dGu Changge said with a warm tone, and gave her the [Domain Traversing Talisman] that he took out from the System\u2019s Warehouse. This thing could help her escape at a critical moment.Of course, that was only possible if she didn\u2019t come across some unfathomable ancient monstrosity.The [Domain Traversing Talisman] could easily break through barriers and spatial restrictions, so it would be able to help her escape danger.From his investigations, he found that Gu Xian\u2019er seemed to be in the Land of Forsaken Immortals. If he considered the tropes and cliches, then the Land of Forsaken Immortals indeed made sense. After all, it was a place no one dared to go to, so it must be hiding great opportunities hidden behind the veil of its great danger.With Yan Ji\u2019s cultivation of the Great Sacred Realm, it won\u2019t be hard for her to travel through the Land of Forsaken Immortals, so she could help her investigate Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s background. He could make better plans to deal with her once he figured out her backing.As for sending someone from the Gu Family?Leaving aside the fact that Gu Changge\u2019s current authority wasn\u2019t enough for him to command the Great Sacred Realm masters of the family, but there were countless eyes keeping track of every movement made by those masters.If he sent someone to the Land of Forsaken Immortals, many would want to know why he did that? Just what was his purpose? He was sure many Elders would immediately connect it to Gu Xian\u2019er.Gu Changge didn\u2019t want to ruin the prestige he had just built in the Gu Family with his own hands.\u201c The Land of Forsaken Immortals? I see. Please rest assured, Young Master! You can leave this to me\u2026\u201dYan Ji nodded and took the [Domain Traversing Talisman] from him. Since Gu Changge had commanded, she would surely get the job done.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySupreme Amethyst Pill Sect; Boring Life of a Villain!Yan Ji left the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s premise with Gu Changge\u2019s token in hand, and no one dared to stop her on the way out.Now that Gu Changge was officially the Young Master of the Gu Family, the power he held in his hands had peaked. The woman in red was a beauty, and she held Gu Changge\u2019s token in her hand, so many of the Family\u2019s people thought in certain directions and dared not offend her.Many Elders also heard reports about her from their informants, but they couldn\u2019t care less about this matter. After all, she wasn\u2019t a member of the Gu Family, and was only a Great Sacred Realm cultivator. It was inevitable that Gu Changge would have such people desiring to tie themselves to his chariot now that he was their Young Master.In the next few days, Gu Changge began making other preparations. His Fortune Value had stabilized, and he had already dealt with the matters in the Family.At the same time, Old Ming also brought back the people of the Gu Family\u2019s exiled lineage, and that caused quite a stir in the Gu Family.Many Elders happily greeted their brethren. Their attitudes towards Gu Changge also relaxed now that they confirmed that he was indeed not tricking them.Gu Changge also showed up at their arrival, but he didn\u2019t say anything. Still, he did tell his confidants to keep an eye on the movements of that lineage\u2019s people in secret. Although he couldn\u2019t be bothered about whatever revenge from them, it was still better for him to have everything under control.The people of that lineage were shocked when they learned that Gu Changge was the one who took the initiative to bring them back, and that he wasn\u2019t forced by the other Elders.They couldn\u2019t help but feel complicated emotions at this realization.Besides that, they couldn\u2019t help but turn silent when they heard the other Elders talk about how Gu Changge, their prodigal brat, had finally turned over a new leaf and wanted to make amends for his past mistakes.This was obviously a great matter for the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.Alas! The hatred from back then couldn\u2019t be resolved so easily. The pain and humiliation they felt, and the pain the little girl \u2014 whose Dao Bone Gu Changge tore out \u2014 felt over the years couldn\u2019t be washed away with an apology this dry.The most important thing was that they still didn\u2019t know Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s whereabouts, nor if she was alive or not.They could still bear their own grudge for the sake of the Family, but they couldn\u2019t accept Gu Changge not doing anything to make up for Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s pains. They absolutely couldn\u2019t accept that!What\u2019s more? Gu Changge didn\u2019t utter a single word of apology. He simply came over, took a glance at everyone, and then left just like that. These actions from him increased the rage in the hearts of the people of that lineage, but they could only stomach their rage helplessly. After all, Gu Changge was now the Young Master of the Family.But then, the suppression on their cultivation base was suddenly removed at Gu Changge\u2019s command, and their cultivation, which had been suppressed over the years, finally recovered to its peak. If that wasn\u2019t enough, then many of their elders locked in the dungeon were also released.This sent their hearts down another spiral of complicated emotions. They didn\u2019t know how they were supposed to treat Gu Changge, and also, they could no longer figure out just what Gu Changge was plotting.In the end, they felt that he was indeed trying to ease the relationship between them, but because of his personality, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to lower his face to apologize. Instead, he chose to show his resolve through the most practical method. Because of this, their attitude towards Gu Changge also eased, and they weren\u2019t as hostile towards him as before.As the saying goes:\u00a0\u2018those who know their mistakes can correct them, and that\u2019s the greatest virtue!\u2019Even someone like Gu Changge could repent and make others feel that he could still be saved[1].[1: from self-destruction by becoming a ruthless devil.]In the end, all of them were from the same Family, so there was no use holding on to deep resentments for long. Although they were exiled for more than a decade, they hadn\u2019t suffered much in the outside world. It\u2019s just that their resentment couldn\u2019t be washed away in a short span of time.Gu Changge also felt their attitude towards him change for the better, but he wasn\u2019t surprised. After all, everything had gone according to his plan. Had he apologized, released the suppression on their cultivation base, and freed their people locked in the dungeon right away, then instead of feeling goodwill towards him, they would have felt that he was plotting something against them.But because he used different methods:\u00a0\u2018didn\u2019t apologize to them, which led to a rise in their rage and irritation, and then directly released their suppression and people,\u2019\u00a0they felt that he was indeed trying to repent, and didn\u2019t have any other intentions. It\u2019s just that he couldn\u2019t bring himself to lower his head before them.The effect of the two methods was completely different, and at extremes with each other!Gu Changge didn\u2019t think he was very smart, it\u2019s just that he always found the correct and most efficient method to deal with his targets.After that, he began to deal with the other matters at hand. Since he was the one who brought Su Qingge and Lin Qiuhan from the Lower Realm, then obviously, he had to be the one to settle the two of them.Now that they had seen the Gu Family\u2019s might and means over the last period of time, they would certainly not get bullied after he sent them to other Heritages for cultivation.Su Qingge was already smart, and wouldn\u2019t have any problems; the one he worried about was Lin Qiuhan. Since Lin Qiuhan had a gentle personality, and her mind wasn\u2019t all that sharp, Gu Changge felt that she probably wouldn\u2019t survive more than a few days if he left her to her own devices in the outside world.However, with her terrifying talent for Alchemy, every Heritage would want to have her as their disciple at any price possible, and she shouldn\u2019t suffer any grievance after he sent her to an Alchemy Heritage.Gu Changge didn\u2019t think about these matters for too long. First, he brought Su Qingge to his mother\u2019s Primordial Divine Sect, since he could also meet his mother at the same time.Primordial Divine Sect.It was an ancient heritage located in the Inner Region of Brahma Heaven that had existed for a long time. It\u2019s territory was so vast that one couldn\u2019t tell it\u2019s exact borders. Because of how they did things back in the day, they were called a Demonic Sect by the various forces of the Upper Realm.Of course, their situation had improved a lot over the years. With the arduous efforts of the Disciples and Elders, they had finally changed their name and fame from a Demonic Sect to a Divine Sect. It\u2019s just that they couldn\u2019t completely cut themselves off from their demonic roots.The rest of the Orthodox heritages had to be extremely cautious when they passed through Brahma Heaven, lest they get robbed.Gu Changge, as the son of the Primordial Divine Sect\u2019s previous Holy Maiden, and the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, naturally arrived in the Primordial Divine Sect unhindered, and found his mother who was lost in her cultivation.The two chatted for a long while, and Gu Changge told his mother the same things he previously said to his father. His mother\u2019s eyes immediately turned red, and she felt distress at her son\u2019s suffering over the years.Gu Changge obviously felt no guilt at this. Anyway, the Devil Heart was no longer a danger to him, and he was sure that his parents didn\u2019t want to see him with the same old nature as before.As for Su Qingge\u2019s origins? Gu Changge felt relieved with leaving that matter to his mother.What\u2019s more? Su Qingge seemed to like his mother as well[2], so Gu Changge asked her to stay with his mother for the time being. Her mother could also help her check her memories and visions and figure out what they were all about.[2: obviously, she likes your damn Momma. She\u2019s banking on yo Momma to get in yo bed, boi.]Gu Changge returned to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family after staying in the Primordial Divine Sect for a few days.After that, he brought Lin Qiuhan to the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect of the Inner Region\u2019s Heavenly East.The Inner Region had many Heavenly regions, and its territory was divided between these Heavenly regions. The Heavenly East bordered the Alchemy-related Lower Realms, and even Alchemy-related worlds of the Upper Realm, and all the Alchemists who Ascended desired nothing more than to go to the Heavenly East at all costs.The Heavenly East had many Supreme Alchemy Grandmasters; the pills they refined with a mere flip of their hands were hard to come by in the outside world. In terms of resources, only a few Heritages and regions could compare to the Heritages of the Heavenly East.In particular, one couldn\u2019t underestimate the authority and connections held by these Alchemy Heritages.Although the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect was a massive Heritage that was once regarded as the number one Alchemy Heritage in the Upper Realm, it had recently found itself overwhelmed by the other heritages. The biggest reason for their decline was the fact that they didn\u2019t have great disciples or an heir.It was already hard to find someone talented in Alchemy, and even then, that talent needed to be qualified to join their Sect. Not just any random Shu, Chu, or Tu could enter the Sect just because they knew how to light a flame.Most of the time, they looked for disciples from the various regions of the Upper Realm as the Lower Realm rarely gave birth to a talented Alchemist who could Ascend. Even if one did Ascend somehow, they would arrive at the Outer Region, and end up becoming miners for the various forces that stood there waiting like hungry wolves.All of these issues had led these Alchemy Heritages to be in continuous search for good disciples. They were rich in resources without a lack of anything, but there were no talented disciples to make use of their resources.It was because of this that various forces of the Upper Realm also kept a lookout for Alchemy talents, so they could send them to the major Alchemy Heritages and get some benefits in return.\u2026\u2026Immortal mountains rose and fell, massive waterfalls splashed their sweet water around, the mighty sun illuminated the world, and Pill Intent permeated every corner of the land. The atmosphere in the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect made it resemble an Immortal\u2019s abode.Right now, waves went through the various peaks of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect. The Peak Masters of the various peaks couldn\u2019t help but rush towards their Sect\u2019s gate once they heard their disciples\u2019 reports.\u201cThe Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family is outside our Sect\u2019s gate?\u201dAlthough the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect claimed to be the number one Holy Land for Alchemy in the Upper Realm, they did know that they were more than a few steps below behemoths like the Ancient Immortal Gu Family and Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace.After all, they were Alchemy Heritages that were versed in making Pills and the like, so they obviously couldn\u2019t compare to forces like the Ancient Immortal Gu Family and the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace when it came to sheer offensive might.Even they had to take a turn in front of such behemoths of the Upper Realm.Now that the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family was at their door, they would need to be extremely cautious when dealing with him, even if they were Elders of their own Sect.The sudden report shocked many Disciples and Elders of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect, and they rushed out with brilliant rays behind them.\u201cIs this the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect you told me about, Young Master? I can smell the fragrance of pills and herbs even though we are standing at their gate\u2026they sure deserve their name as a Pill Sect!\u201dLin Qiuhan was dressed in blue, with a blush adorning her face, as she stood outside the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect\u2019s gate with Gu Changge. The pink on her face made her look bright and lovely as she curiously sized her surroundings.She was extremely happy after she learned that Gu Changge wanted to send her to this Sect to learn Alchemy. After all, she was interested in Alchemy, and she could help Gu Changge after learning it. This way, she wouldn\u2019t be as useless as before.\u201cIt\u2019s a famous Alchemy Heritage in the Upper Realm, after all. Although they are a bit down nowadays, they don\u2019t lack resources. The most important thing is that this Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect is said to have the recipe of the Supreme Amethyst Pill, which is coveted even by Immortals. It\u2019s a Heavenly Elixir, I heard.\u201dGu Changge said with a casual smile. He was dressed in a dress that accentuated his tall and handsome features, as he stood under the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect\u2019s gate. A divine brilliance flowed around his body, and gave him the appearance of a young deity. Many disciples of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect couldn\u2019t help but take a second glance, and be shocked in their hearts at the appearance of his Heavenly visage.There was one thing that Gu Changge didn\u2019t mention:\u00a0\u2018the competition in the other Alchemy Heritages was fierce, and they weren\u2019t in lack of scheming disciples looking to shoot down their peers for a higher place, unlike the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect.\u2019They were in desperate straits, and their entire facade was single-handedly maintained by their bunch of old and decrepit Elders. Talents like Lin Qiuhan would naturally flourish here the most. As long as Lin Qiuhan joins them, Gu Changge will naturally gain a lot of Fortune Value.And if she became the heir of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect, then\u2026[Hiss!]Gu Changge could already imagine his Fortune Value rising without needing him to make any move. When the time comes, he could simply lie down and keep increasing his cultivation by adding points without needing to put in any effort. Aye, the life of a villain was boring indeed.A\u2019Da, Old Ming, and his other confidants stood behind Gu Changge. They released extremely fierce auras, and made the group of disciples standing guard in front of them feel somewhat uncomfortable.At the same time, they couldn\u2019t help but wonder why Gu Changge, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, had come to their door with a woman next to him?They had long heard about him.If one talked about the brightest stars among the younger generation of the Upper Realm, then Gu Changge, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, was definitely the one at the top.God-Child, Reincarnation of a True Immortal, Darling of the Dao\u2026he had too many titles to show just how mighty he was. They could obviously not contain their shock now that they saw the man of rumors standing right before them!Soon, waves of brilliant rays arrived before them, and turned into several figures that landed in front of them. They were the Elders of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect.\u201cOur Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect is honored to receive a visit from the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family!\u201dAn Elder in crimson robes cupped his hands, and greeted Gu Changge with an amiable smile on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNone to Humiliate; None to Smack!The Elder in crimson robes was called Red Flame Elder, the sixth Elder of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect. He had lived for innumerable years, and no one could tell his true age. There were rumors that he had transformed from a ray of Red Flame merging with Heavenly Fire, and his Pill-refining technique was extremely famous in the Upper Realm.There were many other Elders and Disciples following behind him, but he was clearly the leader of their group. There were both men and women in the group of Elders and Disciples, and all of them had Pill Runes condensed in front of their chests to show their identity.They were the Inner Sect disciples of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect. Their cultivation bases weren\u2019t all that strong, though, and they were in the Great-Transcendent Realm.Right now, all of them were watching Gu Changge with curiosity. They wondered what the rumored Young Master Gu had come to their Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect for? Also, why was the cultivation base of the woman standing next to him so weak? She was merely in the Transcendent Realm.[1]It\u2019s just that Gu Changge had an esteemed identity, so they didn\u2019t dare speak out casually in fear of disrespecting him.[1: bruhs, you are only one Realm above her. The audacity!]Right now, all of them were busy guessing Gu Changge\u2019s intentions in visiting them.\u201cYoung Master Changge, do come inside our Sect and take a seat. It would be rude of us to keep you standing outside our Sect\u2019s gate.\u201dRed Flame Elder immediately invited Gu Changge into the Sect. Gu Changge responded to him with a smile and followed behind him. Soon, divine rays of light appeared under everyone\u2019s feet, and they headed towards the depths of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect.[Inside a magnificent palace.]The scent of Pill Incense lingered in the surroundings, giving the palace an ancient aura. Many gorgeous disciples brought tea and refreshments for Gu Changge, and then stepped aside after handing them to him.\u201cI wonder what brought Young Master Changge to our Sect today?\u201dRed Flame Elder took a sip of his tea, and then asked in confusion. The relationship between the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect and the other major forces was relatively good, and there wasn\u2019t much friction between them, so he didn\u2019t think Gu Changge was here to cause some conflict.Gu Changge showed a faint smile on his face, and responded to the Elder\u2019s question.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so polite, Red Flame Elder. In fact, there\u2019s something I need you to do, and that\u2019s what has brought this Changge to visit your Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect.\u201d\u201cOh? Could Young Master Changge be here for this girl next to you?\u201dRed Flame Elder couldn\u2019t help but guess when he heard his words. His gaze also fell on the woman dressed in blue beside Gu Changge. The lady was beautiful, but her cultivation wasn\u2019t all that good. He wasn\u2019t sure about Lin Qiuhan\u2019s identity, so he just called her\u00a0\u2018girl,\u2019\u00a0but judging from her appearance, she must have a close relationship with Gu Changge.Rumors said that Young Master Gu was an extremely indifferent person who looked down on everyone and everything. They said that it was extremely hard to deal with him, but he realized that the rumors weren\u2019t all that correct.At least, he didn\u2019t feel that Gu Changge was difficult to talk to after their short chat. He even gave him a warm feeling, as if a spring breeze was caressing him. He couldn\u2019t understand how such rumors could spread about someone with such a temperament.Red Flame Elder couldn\u2019t help but shake his head.\u201cI brought Qiuhan from the Lower Realm. When I first met her, her talent for Alchemy moved my heart, and I immediately knew that I had to bring her to the Upper Realm. Now that we are in the Upper Realm, I wish to have her join the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect, so as to not waste her talent.\u201dGu Changge said with a faint smile, and didn\u2019t directly say the words that were in his heart:\u00a0\u2018I saw that your Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect\u2019s been down in the dumps lately, so I decided to send you a good seedling.\u2019He would be too ruthless if he said that to their face. After all, he still needed them to cultivate Lin Qiuhan for him, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to take advantage of them if he rubbed salt on their wounds like that.It was because of this that he gave them an implicit hint. If they translated his words, they would understand his meaning:\u00a0\u2018Lin Qiuhan is someone I brought from the Lower Realm, and she has a really good talent for Alchemy. Seeing that your lot doesn\u2019t have any good disciple who can carry the mantle of your Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect, I have decided to grace you with her existence.\u2019Red Flame Elder had a sharp mind, and he immediately understood his hidden meaning, and couldn\u2019t help but show an embarrassed expression. At the same time, he showed an expression of expectation. After all, Gu Changge was the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.\u201cYoung Master Changge\u2019s heart is truly magnanimous! This old man will like to thank Young Master Changge on behalf of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect for your kindness.\u201dRed Flame Elder said with a laugh, and then began scrutinizing Lin Qiuhan\u2019s talent with great seriousness. Lin Qiuhan couldn\u2019t help but show nervousness as he stared at her with a deep expression, but then she recalled Gu Changge was with her and immediately calmed down a lot.\u2018Don\u2019t panic! Young Master Gu is standing right behind you!\u2019Lin Qiuhan said to herself in her heart.Gu Changge, on the other hand, showed the same smile, and no change could be seen in his expression. He was clear about Lin Qiuhan\u2019s terrifying talent for Alchemy, and even a Heritage as strong as the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect would need to lower their heads and accept her as a prodigy.It\u2019s just that he felt kind of bored since no one jumped out to raise doubts and call him out for bragging. After all, if they were following the normal trope, then a bunch of Inner Sect Disciples of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect would jump to their toes and ridicule Lin Qiuhan for her weak cultivation base, and her Lower Realm origins.It was a pity that she had great Fortune, and didn\u2019t need to go through all that.It seems that after staying by his side for so long, she was no longer able to live through the trope of a waste slapping the faces of those who looked down on her.Gu Changge felt that life wasn\u2019t interesting. No one questioned him, no one dared to provoke him, and he had no opportunity to use absolute might to smack someone down either.Everyone feared him too much.\u201cWHAT?!\u201dRight then, Red Flame Elder showed a surprised expression as he couldn\u2019t believe Lin Qiuhan\u2019s talent. He didn\u2019t know how terrifying it was when he hadn\u2019t tested her, but now that he had tested her, he understood well the greatness of her talent. After all, talent wasn\u2019t plastered on someone\u2019s forehead. Even if someone had a high cultivation, they couldn\u2019t easily see through someone\u2019s talent.To find out the depths of someone\u2019s talent, one had to carefully scrutinize them.After he carefully checked Lin Qiuhan\u2019s talent, he realized that his little girl actually had a terrifying Pill Intent, no, she was born with Innate Pill Intent!One had to know that Alchemy Grand Masters could only dream of getting their hands on a mere wisp of Pill Intent, yet this girl was born with Pill Intent.He was shocked and felt incredulous.No matter which Alchemy Heritage she went to, she would have a promising future!\u201cThis girl\u2019s talent\u2026\u201dRed Flame Elder was overjoyed \u2014 excited, even \u2014 and couldn\u2019t believe his own findings. Immediately, he ordered a disciple behind him to bring some Mystical tools to test Lin Qiuhan\u2019s talent.\u201cRed Flame Elder, how is Qiuhan\u2019s talent?\u201dGu Changge asked with a faint smile. He had already expected him to react like that, but he still needed to pretend.\u201cThis girl\u2019s talent is kind of insane. I never thought someone like her would appear in the Lower Realm, and even be discovered by Young Master Changge.\u201dRed Flame Elder also showed a smile, and stared at Lin Qiuhan with shining eyes as if he was looking at some unparalleled gem.\u201cGirl, would you like to take this old man as your Master?\u201dHis sudden words immediately confused Lin Qiuhan, and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if her talent for Alchemy was really all that great. At the same time, she turned towards Gu Changge for help.\u201cYou can decide this for yourself.\u201dGu Changge said with a smile, and left the choice in her hands. It wouldn\u2019t be fun if he had to help her decide even on something like her Master. However, he didn\u2019t like how this shady Red Flame Elder wanted to snatch Lin Qiuhan for himself before anyone else.\u201cStill, I think you should wait for the other Elders to come here, Qiuhan. The Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect has a lot of Elders, so you should pick the one most suitable for you.\u201dGu Changge used the word\u00a0\u2018pick\u2019\u00a0without any hesitation.Red Flame Elder couldn\u2019t help but feel his spirits deflate. After all, he was indeed trying to snatch the treasure before anyone else could see it. Alas! Gu Changge ruined his chance with a few words.As for Gu Changge using the word\u00a0\u2018pick\u2019? He didn\u2019t feel that there was anything wrong with it.Now, it wasn\u2019t a matter of whether they (their Sect) were willing to accept Lin Qiuhan as their disciple, but whether she was willing to join their Sect! It won\u2019t be long before the other Elders also arrived, so he felt that he had to get her at any cost possible. After all, he probably won\u2019t have the same opportunity again.As for the Inner Sect Disciples of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect? They were shocked, and couldn\u2019t help but wonder just how terrifying the talent of the woman dressed in blue was.\u201cLittle girl, if you are willing to be this old man\u2019s disciple, this old man guarantees you that you will have whatever pill you desire. When it comes to controlling flames, this old man can guarantee that only a few in the Upper Realm are better than this old man!\u201dRed Flame Elder was prepared to entice Lin Qiuhan at any cost. He wanted to lay the foundation for Lin Qiuhan to choose him as her Master before the others arrived on the scene.Right then, a group of old and decrepit Elders of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect appeared outside the hall in which Gu Changge and the others were sitting. All of these Elders were ancient fossils with terrifying connections, immeasurable resources, and great fame for their skills in Alchemy in the Upper Realm.\u201cThis old man heard that Young Master Changge brought a great seedling for our Sect!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Changge sure has a magnanimous heart. Our Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect is extremely grateful for your favor!\u201dAll of the Elders had terrifying auras. They greeted Gu Changge in haste, and then immediately turned their gazes towards Lin Qiuhan, and stared at her like a bunch of hungry wolves staring at a fat lamb.They had already heard the details from their informants on the way to this place.\u201cShe has more than one stand of Innate Pill Intent\u2026no, wait\u2026she has so many strands of Pill Intent! How could this be possible?\u201d\u201cThis girl wouldn\u2019t have transformed from some Ancient Divine Pill, right?\u201d\u201cA talent like hers hasn\u2019t appeared in millions of years! It seems that we can finally raise our heads when the various Sects compete.\u201d[Hiss!]The people in the palace couldn\u2019t help but take in deep breaths. They quickly prepared the Mystical tool used to test talent, and brought it before Lin Qiuhan.[Buzz!]A splendid brilliance, accompanied by a light tremor, bloomed in the center of the palace, and various dazzling scenes emerged and illuminated every corner of the palace. Many of the disciples couldn\u2019t help but close their eyes to avoid going blind from the bright light.\u201cThe results of the test are as expected; this girl has the most suitable physique for Alchemy! Give her to this old man, and this old man guarantees that she will be a renowned Alchemy Grandmaster within twenty years!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better if you leave this little girl to this old lady! What if you bunch of old men taught her something wrong and ruined her future? Little girl, you should follow me. I guarantee that you will be a renowned Alchemy Grandmaster admired by myriads of people in just eighteen years!\u201d\u201cThis old man can do that in fifteen years!\u201d\u201cFifteen years? Old man, I only need thirteen years and three months! Hehe, little girl, your talent is great, so you should choose this old man as your Master. You will be the next Peak Master of this old man\u2019s Heavenly Pillar Peak, and even becoming the next Sect Mistress won\u2019t be impossible!\u201dAll the disciples of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect were shocked and scared when they watched their high and mighty Elders fight over a disciple like old women fighting over cabbage in a village\u2019s market. They couldn\u2019t believe that the Elders they couldn\u2019t even gaze upon on normal days would be fighting among themselves just to take in a disciple!\u201cYoung Master!\u201dLin Qiuhan blinked and looked towards Gu Changge for help; she had never encountered so many people with such oppressive auras in one place, so she couldn\u2019t help but feel lightheaded.\u201cYou can choose on your own.\u201dGu Changge said in response.\u201cNo, I will do what Young Master says!\u201dLin Qiuhan pursed her lips and threw the ball back to Gu Changge.\u2018Why isn\u2019t your brain this sharp on regular days?\u2019Gu Changge wanted to give her a smack on the back of her head.\u201cThis little girl might as well be my disciple. I only need ten years to turn her into an Alchemy Grandmaster.\u201dRight then, a gentle voice came from outside the palace, and a gorgeous lady with a smile on her face walked in. Her figure was ethereal, and it appeared as if she had descended from another world. No one could estimate the depths of her might.\u201cSect Leader!\u201dAll the disciples and Elders in the palace greeted her with extreme courtesy.As for her words? They were obviously directed towards Gu Changge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNo Simple Character; Fianc\u00e9e is Here!Gu Changge squinted his eyes, but his expression soon returned to normal.The person in front of him was the Sect Leader of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect, Zi Yan. She was the one at the helm of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect, and although she was a woman, she was extremely well-known in the Upper Realm for her great strength and accomplishments in the Dao of Alchemy.Though she didn\u2019t appear all that old, her youthful appearance was a mere facade. She could easily be Gu Changge\u2019s ancestor if her true age was to be mentioned.When Gu Changge arrived here, he had considered having Lin Qiuhan take her as her Master, so now that she delivered herself to their door, she helped save him a lot of effort.\u201cYoung Master Changge truly has a magnanimous heart. You have solved our Sect\u2019s urgent worry by bringing such a good seedling to our Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect.\u201dSect Leader Zi said with a smile after she arrived inside the palace. Her voice was extremely soothing, while the depths of her cultivation couldn\u2019t be fathomed. At the same time, her gaze landed on Gu Changge, and it was as if she wanted to see through him.She had long heard of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2019s supreme genius through various rumors that claimed that he was an extremely indifferent and ruthless man who only cared about cultivation.The incident that happened in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family more than a decade ago wasn\u2019t completely hidden from the other supreme heritages. Although they quickly concealed the details, she still heard some rumors about the incident.They said that the entire matter was orchestrated by the young man who stood before her!\u201cYou jest, Senior Zi Yan. This junior is merely presenting the Buddha with borrowed flowers[1]. The Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect is the best place for Qiuhan, after all.\u201d[1: winning someone\u2019s favor by using someone else\u2019s property/winning favor through plagiarism/winning favor by offering something that doesn\u2019t belong to you.]Gu Changge said with a smile that seemed to not have any shred of deceit.Sect Leader Zi Yan responded to his words with a perfunctory smile. She didn\u2019t know whether the rumors were true or not, but she was sure that the young man in front of her was an extraordinary man of deep schemes.What\u2019s more? His cultivation was also quite high, and there wouldn\u2019t be many in the Upper Realm\u2019s younger generation who could compare to him.He was a scheming, handsome man who knew how to be graceful and gentle \u2014 he was no simple character!\u201cThis is the Supreme Amethyst Order of our Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect. With this, you can have any Alchemist of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect at your beck and call, Young Master Changge.\u201d\u201cYou can even call forth an Elder or Peak Master of my Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect using this Supreme Amethyst Order, but it can only be used once in that case.\u201d\u201cOur Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect will not forget Young Master Changge\u2019s grace of bringing this child to our door.\u201dRight then, something appeared in the hands of Sect Leader Zi Yan, while she spoke. It was a token engraved with Alchemy runes, and one couldn\u2019t guess what kind of Immortal ore was used in its casting. It had an extremely simple appearance, and the words Supreme Amethyst were written on it in bold.\u201cSect Leader!\u201dThe Elders of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect couldn\u2019t help but show a change in their expressions. They never thought their Sect Leader would directly bestow a Supreme Amethyst Order upon Gu Changge.As for what it meant to have a Supreme Amethyst Order? It went without saying! To various heritages in the Upper Realm, seeing the Supreme Amethyst Order was the same as seeing the Sect Leader of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect!Even if Gu Changge, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, sent them a seedling as good as Lin Qiuhan, he still didn\u2019t deserve such a thing no matter how grateful they might be towards him!\u201cOh, this junior will graciously accept your generosity!\u201dGu Changge would obviously not let go of such a good deal. He knew well what the Supreme Amethyst Order represented. It wouldn\u2019t be an understatement to say that the Supreme Amethyst Order held immense authority, and could let him command innumerable Alchemists in the Upper Realm.Even he was surprised to see Sect Leader Zi Yan giving him such a good thing.Adhering to the principles of not giving benefits without gaining any returns, Gu Changge naturally accepted her gesture. In the future, he wouldn\u2019t even need to prepare medicinal herbs and other materials if he needed the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect\u2019s alchemists to make some pills for him; he could just take out the Supreme Amethyst Order and enjoy free stuff.He could even get a bunch of [Immortal Spirit-Gathering Pills], [Spirit Transformation Pills], etc\u2026Naturally, Gu Changge understood the meaning behind Sect Leader Zi Yan giving him the Supreme Amethyst Order \u2014 she wanted him to sell Lin Qiuhan to them in exchange for it. He couldn\u2019t help but feel interested as he realized this.Unfortunately for them, he didn\u2019t need to worry about taking any losses. Since he dared to send Lin Qiuhan over to them, then he was naturally not worried about her betraying him.\u201cQiuhan, this person is the Sect Leader of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect. From now on, she will be your Master, so you must work hard and learn the art of Alchemy from her!\u201dAfter that, Gu Changge smiled and caressed Lin Qiuhan\u2019s head without mentioning anything about handing her over to the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect. Either way, the Supreme Amethyst Order was already in his hands, so he wasn\u2019t worried about them taking it back.He couldn\u2019t be bothered to think too much about these matters.Still, Gu Changge did want to give a good person card to Sect Leader Zi Yan. He was already taking advantage of them[2], yet she was giving him even more benefits!\u201cUnderstood! You can rest assured, Young Master, I will not fail your expectations!\u201dLin Qiuhan obediently responded. At the same time, she felt her face burn in response to such intimate contact from Gu Changge.[2: by having them raise Lin Qiuhan for him by investing infinite resources. They are pretty much gonna give him their Sect like this.]Sect Leader Zi Yan\u2019s expression turned stiff when she saw that Gu Changge was pretending to not understand her hidden meaning. His actions were completely out of her expectations, but her expression soon returned to its former calm.Still, she wondered why she felt as if she just smashed a dog with a bunch of meat buns?She couldn\u2019t help but regret and wonder why she thought that Gu Changge would be a kind, reasonable person?Sure enough, his amiable face was nothing more than a facade, and even she was tricked into thinking that he might not be an evil man.Well, Sect Leader Zi Yan believed that after Lin Qiuhan stayed in their Sect for a while, and underwent her teachings, she would surely develop deep feelings for the Sect in no time. At that time, Gu Changge\u2019s plan to use their Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect to help him raise an Alchemy Grandmaster for him would naturally fall apart.\u201cYour name is Qiuhan, right? From now on, you will call me Master.\u201dSect Leader Zi Yan gently said to Lin Qiuhan. She already liked this innocent and naive child, and even planned to raise her as the future Sect Leader of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect.[3][3: at this moment, the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect sould its soul to Big Daddy Gu Changge.]With her horrifying talent for Alchemy, it won\u2019t be impossible for Lin Qiuhan to surpass her in the future.\u201cQiuhan pays respects to Master!\u201dLin Qiuhan was also an obedient girl, and immediately greeted her Master with the expected courtesy. She also had a good impression of this Master who gave stuff to her Young Master as soon as they met.\u2026\u2026In just one trip, not only did Gu Changge send Lin Qiuhan to the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect, but Lin Qiuhan also became the disciple of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect\u2019s Sect Leader. Not only did the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect owe him a favor, but he also received their Supreme Amethyst Order without doing anything.Even his Fortune Value shot up by 500 Points!Gu Changge felt that his trip to the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect wasn\u2019t in vain.Soon, Gu Changge\u2019s figure appeared outside the gate of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect, with the Elders of the Sect behind him to send him off.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dA\u2019Da, Old Ming, and the other retainers greeted him as soon as he appeared.\u201cElders, thank you all for seeing me off. I will leave Qiuhan in your care, and I hope that I can rest assured about her.\u201dGu Changge turned towards the Elders behind him, and said with a faint smile on his face.\u201cWhat are you saying, Young Master Changge? Our Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect is the one that needs to thank you, and we will never forget this favor!\u201dThe Elders cupped their hands and responded to him with a smile. In their hearts, however, they couldn\u2019t help but roll their eyes in annoyance.Although the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family had a gentle and amiable appearance, his heart sure was dark and crafty. He downed a Supreme Amethyst Order without a single change in his expression, as if it was nothing big. They still remembered the shocked expression of their Sect Leader, and how she wanted to take it back but couldn\u2019t.\u2026\u2026\u201cQiuhan, how did you meet with Young Master Gu?\u201dOnce Gu Changge left, Sect Leader Zi Yan couldn\u2019t help but ask out of curiosity while teaching Lin Qiuhan the rules of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect.Where did Gu Changge even find such a naive Lin Qiuhan?It seemed that Gu Changge had completely kept Lin Qiuhan in the dark, and she had no idea that she was helping Gu Changge count the money he earned from selling her.Sect Leader Zi Yan couldn\u2019t help but worry about her disciple. Her disciple didn\u2019t appear to be that silly, but\u2026Alas!\u201cMaster, you want to know how I met the Young Master? When I first met the Young Master, we were in the Ancient Lin Family of the Middle State\u2026it\u2019s my Family, by the way\u2026\u201dAs Lin Qiuhan spoke about their first meeting, she recalled the scene that was still clear in her mind. Back then, Gu Changge was like a young god sitting at the head\u2019s seat, and overlooking everything with a casual expression.At that time, she was standing with the crowd outside the hall, and secretly stealing glances at him.Sect Leader Zi Yan was left speechless as she heard her explain their meeting. She had lived for thousands of years, so she could easily see through such pretenses at a glance.Indeed, that Gu Changge was no kind soul. Just a few random tricks from him were enough to make Lin Qiuhan fall for him.It seemed that she would need to remind Lin Qiuhan to stay away from that Gu Changge in the future, and she would also need to help her see his true face.\u2026\u2026Gu Changge and his group directly returned to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family from the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect in the Heavenly East.Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Gu Changge sat in a lotus position in his calm and quiet palace. With snow-white clothes untouched by the dust, and neatly tied hair that resembled threads of crystals reflecting light, he looked like a transcendent being.His face showed an incomparable calm, his eyes appeared as vast as the universe, and countless black runes flashed past his pupils. In the palm of his hand, he held a [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] filled with pitch-black divine light that floated up and down.\u201cIt took me so many days just to refine such a small Devil Bottle\u2026\u201dGu Changge muttered to himself, and then quickly stored the devilish [Great Dao Treasured Bottle]. A ray of jet black light flashed past his eyes, and the Devil Bottle disappeared between his brows.\u2018Attributes Panel!\u2019Gu Changge called out to the System in his heart.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Host: Gu ChanggeHalo: Destined Heavenly VillainWeapon(s): Eight Desolate Demon HalberdIdentity: True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace | Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu FamilyInnate Bloodline(s): Devil Heart | Dao BoneCultivation: Conferred King (Initial Stage)Mystical Abilities: Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex [8th Layer (30%)]Myriad Changes Demonic Physique (Talent)Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple (Talent)Void Ability (Talent)Immortal-Devouring Demonic ArtInfinite Immortal Wisdom\u2026\u2026Destiny Points: 1000Fortune Value: 1500 (Dark)System Shop: OpenWarehouse:One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x3 (Merge)Fortune Plundering Card x3\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but groan after taking a look at his lacking Destiny Points. At the same time, he went to look through the System\u2019s Shop.\u2018If I exchange my Fortune Value, I will have sexteen thousand Destiny Points, and those should be enough for me to get a lot of good stuff.\u2019Although the Dao Bone was great, it didn\u2019t belong to him. What\u2019s more? His Devil Heart completely restrained the abilities of the Dao Bone[4], and that made it kind of useless to him.[4: I presume the Dao Bone is spending almost all of its ability in just shrouding and suppressing his Devil Heart, so it\u2019s mostly restrained and can\u2019t show its true might.]Of course, he would only take a look at the System\u2019s catalogue right now, so as to make preparations for the future. The only reason he hadn\u2019t already returned to the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace was because he was waiting for Yan Ji\u2019s return, so he could learn about Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s whereabouts, and make necessary preparations to deal with her.Soon, Gu Changge noticed a few good things, and couldn\u2019t help but narrow his eyes.\u2018I will have more methods with these in my hand.\u2019The corner of his lips curled up to show a mysterious smile. No matter how strong Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s backing, it wouldn\u2019t matter as long as he had everything under control. But right at this moment, the voice of a servant sounded from outside his palace, and the servant\u2019s words brought him some surprise.\u201cYoung Master, the Patriarch has commanded you to appear in the Main Hall. The Emperor of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty and their Forth Princess have come to see you. They are waiting for you in the Main Hall right now!\u201dGu Changge was taken aback for a moment, but then chuckled.\u2018My dear fianc\u00e9e, you are here already?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNot Here for a Divorce; Muddled Memories?Gu Changge got up and left his palace. At the same time, he recalled the memories related to his fiancee.Yue Mingkong, the fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty.The two of them were engaged during their early years. Be it talent, appearance, or background, she was someone extremely suitable for him. Alas! He could tell from his memories that his Original held no good feelings for her, nor any malice, and only considered her to be a tool.A while ago, he had received a prompt from the System telling him about the appearance of a Favored Daughter of Heaven, but he hadn\u2019t heard any more news after that.Gu Changge thought about it for a long while, and looked at everyone around him; he even went ahead and took a look at the Fortune Value of his cousins and relatives in the Family, but didn\u2019t find anyone worthy of attention. Their Fortune Value wasn\u2019t all that high, at least, they were much worse than Su Qingge and Lin Qiuhan.In the end, the only possible suspect left was his fiancee. Still, it was only his guess, and he couldn\u2019t be sure until he saw her.Well, he hadn\u2019t done anything to annul the engagement between them, so she shouldn\u2019t hold animosity towards him, right?[1][1: it\u2019s the Lin Tian trope but in reverse. If Gu Changge had annulled the engagement, then Yue Mingkong would be the one who would come to slap his face.]Could she be here purely to give him a warm greeting, and deliver herself to his arms as his future wife?Matters couldn\u2019t be that simple!The most important thing was that Gu Changge had asked his people to get him some news about his fiancee, and what he got was that:\u00a0\u2018Yue Mingkong had kept a low profile, and done nothing worthy of attention since her early years. It\u2019s just that recently, she completely changed and defeated her siblings with an iron fist to forcefully take the position of Crown Princess!\u2019Gu Changge could tell she wasn\u2019t an ordinary person who he could easily deal with. Still, his face remained calm, and he didn\u2019t dwell on his thoughts for long. Either way, he would be able to find out the truth once he checked his so-called fiancee\u2019s Fortune Value.However, he reckoned that if she was really a Favored Daughter of Heaven, then, as the princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, her Fortune Value must be through the roof.Gu Changge stopped bothering with the matter after giving it some more thought. With the status and authority held by the Ancient Immortal Gu Family and the Supreme Immortal Dynasty in the Upper Realm, there was nothing wrong with a marriage contract between them. This event might as well just be a meeting between him and his future wife, and nothing more.Though, Gu Changge did wonder what kind of trope his fiancee would follow if she was really a Favored Daughter of Heaven?\u2026\u2026Divine brilliance loomed in the magnificent and imposing Main Hall.Gu Lintian, the current Patriarch of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, was all smiles as he talked with a heroic man dressed in Imperial robes sitting right in front of him.The heroic man in Imperial robes had a godly aura, and his breath was vast and majestic. Although he was sitting without doing anything, he resembled a mighty being who could shake the Universe with a flip of his palm, and terrible visions revolved around him.He was Emperor Yue of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty!It\u2019s just that the one who came to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family was merely his Dharma Puppet. His real body still needed to stay behind in the Immortal Dynasty\u2019s Imperial City, and he couldn\u2019t easily leave in person.Emperor Yue and Gu Lintian had been friends since young, and they had decided to bring their families closer together by setting an engagement between their offsprings a long time ago.Now that Yue Mingkong had been designated as the Crown Princess, she held terrifying authority in the Supreme Immortal Dynasty. Although she was young, she already held more power than many of the figures of the older generation in the Upper Realm, and no one could ignore her existence.Her image of a fierce Empress had already spread far and wide in the Upper Realm, causing a great sensation in every corner of the world.Her celestial appearance already brought her a lot of attention, but now, she had also broken through to the Conferred Lord Realm. At least, that was the cultivation she showed on the surface.Right now, many Elders and young\u2019uns in the Main Hall were secretly watching the beautiful woman in front of them. She had a picturesque, fairy-like visage, and her lustrous hair was tied up in a neat bun above her head. She looked breathtakingly beautiful!She had slender, willow-like eyebrows, and her phoenix eyes appeared deep and unmoving.Her nose was delicate and adorable, and her lips were like petals of a rose in full bloom. Her face appeared as if blood would drip from it with a gentle touch, noble and graceful.Her skin was fair and delicate, like fine porcelain, and she had a tall and slender figure.She wasn\u2019t wearing an Imperial robe, instead, she was dressed in a gray, gauze long dress. A hazy brilliance flowed around her figure, giving her a fairy-like appearance, while also revealing her palpable majesty.Although the woman stood there with a calm expression on her face, the majestic aura she radiated gave her peers an incomparable pressure.She subconsciously radiated the might of an Emperor!Many Elders couldn\u2019t help but sigh in their hearts and worry that the marriage between such a magnificent woman and the Gu Family\u2019s Young Master might arouse the fear and displeasure of many Heritages and Races.The Crown Princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty and the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family\u2026no matter who one talked about, they would have an incomparably bright future, and they were destined to stand at the pinnacle of the Upper Realm with authority over endless subjects and territory.The fact that the Supreme Immortal Dynasty and the Ancient Immortal Gu Family were joining forces wasn\u2019t a good sign for the rest of the world.Since time immemorial, many Supreme Heritages, Immortal Sects, and Grand Dynasties had made alliances through marriages, but none of them had made an alliance through a marriage between their direct future heirs.This would cause an unimaginable sensation!Alas! The other Heritages couldn\u2019t say anything. After all, when the engagement between Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong was set, the two hadn\u2019t yet been appointed as the successors of their forces. What\u2019s more? The two had reached their position through competing fairly with their own strength, and this wasn\u2019t something that came as a result of a conspiracy.Could they still pressure the two forces to annul the engagement even after all that?They didn\u2019t dare to, nor did they have any such ability.Everyone in the Main Hall had different thoughts, and they all imagined their own results that might come from this marriage.\u2026\u2026Right now, Yue Mingkong\u2019s heart was in turmoil. She appeared calm on the surface, but her heart was troubled. She had been to this familiar Main Hall many times, and she could even name many of the familiar faces from the Gu Family who stood in the Hall.In her previous life, her father always treated with a harsh and strict attitude, but her Uncle Gu Lintian always showered her with love and care. It was because of this that she loved to come to the Gu Family when she had nothing to do. Although Gu Changge treated her indifferently, his parents treated her with incomparable warmth, as if she was their daughter.Their treatment touched Yue Mingkong\u2019s heart, but in the end, even they were left in a heartbroken state because of Gu Changge, and didn\u2019t have a good end.Back then, when Gu Lintian was about to break through to another Realm in his cultivation, he suffered from a mental demon\u2019s backlash. He couldn\u2019t help but question himself if he was even worthy of his position and power after what he did to the little girl and her lineage back in the day?He was never able to purge the mental demon, and instead, the mental demon grew stronger with the rise in his cultivation.Gu Changge\u2019s mother was no different. In the end, she fell into depression and sickness, and no medicine or treasure could cure her.Yue Mingkong felt uncomfortable, and couldn\u2019t help but blame herself for everything, as she thought about the events of her past life. She was unable to stop all that in her previous life, but in this life, she will certainly not let those tragedies repeat.Gu Changge, that unfilial son!Not only did he deeply hurt her, but he also hurt his own parents!Yue Mingkong soon recovered from her daze. Right at that moment, the voice of a servant came from the outside as he announced someone\u2019s arrival.\u201cYoung Master is here!\u201dAs soon as Yue Mingkong heard those words, a complicated light flashed through her eyes, but it disappeared soon after. The person she didn\u2019t want to see the most, and the person she wanted to see the most, was finally here.She slowly turned her head towards the entrance, and her eyes shone for a moment. The man who walked in was dressed in simple and clean white robes. He had a handsome and graceful appearance, like a warm and soothing jade, and his jet-black hair sparkled like black jade.\u201cFather! Uncle!\u201dGu Changge greeted the two first, and then looked at his fiancee.Although he had seen her many times in his memories, when he saw her in person for the first time, he couldn\u2019t help but accept that she was indeed incomparably gorgeous.What did a flawless, fairy-like face look like? It looked like the one that was right in front of him.Anyways, words alone couldn\u2019t describe the woman\u2019s peerless beauty.The most important thing was her temperament. She inadvertently revealed the temperament of a supreme overlord. This wasn\u2019t a temperament that ordinary people could possess.At the same time, Gu Changge used the System to take a look at Yue Mingkong\u2019s Fortune Value. Immediately, he was stunned by what he saw.\u201cChangge, Mingkong, why don\u2019t you two young\u2019uns go and have a chat? Mingkong finally came to our Gu Family, so you should bring her around on a walk. Let her see the beautiful scenery of our Gu Family!\u201dGu Lintian immediately said to Gu Changge after he finally arrived. He hoped that this opportunity could bring the two of them closer together.Emperor Yue also nodded and said, \u201cMingkong, I need to discuss other matters with your Uncle Gu, so you and Nephew Changge should go around on a walk. Weren\u2019t you always hopping in happiness when we came here in the past, so what happened today? Why are you so quiet?\u201dYue Mingkong immediately recovered from her daze once she heard her father\u2019s words, and replied, \u201cMingkong understands, Father!\u201dShe was still in a trance, and couldn\u2019t help but wonder why the scene was different from what she saw in her last life?She remembered that when Gu Changge came in the last time, he was dressed in black robes, and had an extremely indifferent expression. He appeared as if he couldn\u2019t be bothered about anyone or anything, and didn\u2019t even give her a glance.His expression today\u2026although his appearance was the same, he seemed to be a completely different person.Yue Mingkong couldn\u2019t help but wonder if her memories were muddled or something?\u201cMingkong, shall we go out for a chat?\u201dRight then, Gu Changge asked her. His voice was natural, but his expression was a little weird.\u201cUn.\u201dYue Mingkong nodded and left the Main Hall, following behind him.She was confused.She felt that something was very wrong. How come he called her Mingkong so affectionately? She hadn\u2019t heard him call her by her name more than a few times in her past life!What\u2019s more? His expression didn\u2019t seem to be faked.Yue Mingkong felt that matters were getting somewhat out of hand.Ever since she regressed, she was the one in control in every situation, and not once did she make a mistake. Relying on her knowledge of the future, she took every step with care and perfection, but how come her knowledge crumbled as soon as Gu Changge appeared before her?Or\u2026could it be that he was the same as her? He was also someone who had regressed, and he was now pretending to be like this to trick her?Or\u2026could it be that her regression had caused some change to occur in him?Yue Mingkong couldn\u2019t tell how she felt, but her feelings towards Gu Changge remained the same. He was still the same, be it his aura, temperament, or that indifferent attitude.He couldn\u2019t change his true face.What had changed was his attitude towards her!Soon, she realized that she had nothing to talk about with him.The two of them arrived on a mountain, walking side by side like a pair of Immortals. The mountain was shrouded in a hazy mist, the scenery before them was wonderful, and the surroundings looked magnificent.Yue Mingkong looked at Gu Changge, who was standing beside her, and didn\u2019t know what to say. In her previous life, the two of them seldom walked side by side like this, and even if they did, they were merely acting in front of outsiders.\u2018Even if Gu Changge\u2019s attitude towards you improves, it won\u2019t wash away the pain he inflicted on you in your past life!\u2019Yue Mingkong reminded herself in her heart.Her expression quickly calmed down, and she stared at the mountain\u2019s fairytale-like scenery, the birds that flew around, and the beasts that roamed everywhere.She didn\u2019t speak. It was obvious that she was worried.\u201cI almost thought you came here to get a divorce!\u201dFinally, Gu Changge opened his mouth with a casual smile, and broke the silence between the two of them.Purple Fortune!What did Purple represent in the list of Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, and Purple?If that wasn\u2019t enough to shock one, then her Fortune Value was also as high as eight thousand Points! As for the numbers beyond eight, Gu Changge couldn\u2019t be bothered to look too closely.The reason Gu Changge was stunned as soon as he checked her with the System was her broken Fortune Value.She was a walking and talking ATM machine!As soon as Yue Mingkong heard Gu Changge\u2019s words, she was left stunned on her spot, and her pupils shrank. She hadn\u2019t even considered something like that as it was simply unrealistic.But why did Gu Changge say that so suddenly?Was he implying that he already knew that she had regressed to the past?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlso a Regressor; Yue Mingkong\u2019s Experience!Yue Mingkong wasn\u2019t an ordinary person either. Various thoughts flashed through her mind, and her expression soon recovered. No abnormality could be seen on her gorgeous, flawless face.\u201cChangge, why do you say that? Isn\u2019t it you who wants a divorce? You have always hated me, after all.\u201dShe tilted her head and looked at Gu Changge with an aggrieved expression.Her cute and playful expression brought out a different charm. No one would have thought that she \u2014 the fierce Crown Princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, whose prestige towered through the Heavens, and overlooked everything in the world from high above \u2014 would be capable of showing such a face.Gu Changge didn\u2019t seem to be surprised by her response. Without a change in his smile, he continued, \u201cI was merely joking, Mingkong, so why so serious?\u201d\u201cI thought you hated me a lot.\u201dYue Mingkong lowered her head and muttered to herself. She did her best to maintain her former appearance before Gu Changge. Back in the day, she would always act like this to please him, but all she received in return was his indifference.To make sure he wouldn\u2019t discover any discrepancies between her past and present actions, Yue Mingkong deliberately tried not to act any differently from what he was used to.She was exactly like how she used to be in front of Gu Changge:\u00a0\u2018humble, cautious, and in love to the point where she would be willing to perish for him\u2026\u2019Right now, she was even more certain that Gu Changge was just like her; he must have also regressed from the future! Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be testing her with his words.Yue Mingkong was well aware of her future husband\u2019s terror, so she couldn\u2019t help but raise her guard. Until she was sure that he hadn\u2019t regressed, she wouldn\u2019t do anything that could give away the fact that she had regressed from the future.Since he could kill her once in their previous life, then his means in this life must be worse than before!Yue Mingkong felt stifled as she thought about this, but she quickly calmed her heart and cooled her mind. She felt that she had to tread more carefully in the future. After all, her actions over the last half\u00a0 a year were completely different from her past life\u2019s actions.With Gu Changge\u2019s sharp mind, he might have already made some guesses, and was just testing her right now. What\u2019s more? His gentle appearance right now was in complete contrast to what she was used to in their past life, and that confused her even more.As for why he put on this facade? She thought that it must also be a test from him.Otherwise, how could one explain his actions that were completely different from what she knew from their past life?\u201cMingkong, I realized that you have changed a lot over the past few months.\u201dYue Mingkong\u2019s heart sank as she heard those words, and she realized that Gu Changge was looking at her with an expression of intrigue. She couldn\u2019t guess what went through his mind.She felt nervous.Could it be that he really knew something? The fact that she had regressed from the future was her biggest secret, and she couldn\u2019t let anyone else find out about it.\u201cChangge, what are you talking about? How have I changed in any way? You are the one who\u2019s different; you never treated me with such gentleness before, so what happened this time?\u201dYue Mingkong\u2019s eyes showed just the right amount of doubt as she stared at Gu Changge with the intent to see through him. Right now, she had to bring out her best acting skills to make sure he couldn\u2019t find any flaws.Still, Yue Mingking couldn\u2019t suppress her nervousness. She realized that although she was the Crown Princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, who could dictate the life and death of innumerable people, her confidence couldn\u2019t help but deflate when she stood in front of Gu Changge.He thoroughly suppressed her no matter what she did!\u201cIndeed, it was too much for me to treat you like that! But fret not, I will not treat you like that in the future.\u201dGu Changge showed an expression of guilt and self-blame in response to her words, and said with a sigh.\u201cChangge\u2026Changge, are you telling the truth?\u201dHis response dumbfounded Yue Mingkong. She couldn\u2019t help but stutter somewhat as she looked at him with her beautiful eyes wide open. Could it be that he truly felt ashamed after regressing to the past, and meant what he said?She couldn\u2019t believe that such words laced with guilt would come out of Gu Changge\u2019s mouth! After all, he was a ruthless, cold-blooded person.Her heart went into turmoil, and she wondered if she could forgive him if his words were the truth?No, she couldn\u2019t be that easy.He always used and hurt her in their previous life, and in the end, he even killed her in cold blood. How could she be so weak and lose her resolve after hearing a few words from him?Gu Changge was her nemesis!Matters couldn\u2019t be this simple! There was definitely something wrong with his actions! He was most likely still testing her!Yue Mingkong broke out in a cold sweat as she reached this conclusion. Gu Changge methods and schemes had always been unfathomable and unpredictable \u2014 one error from her would be enough to give her away.In the next moment, Yue Mingkong raised her head and looked at Gu Changge. Her expression showed that she was touched by his proclamation, and her eyes were filled with joy as she said, \u201cChangge, are you telling the truth? Will you really not treat me with the same indifference as before? That\u2019s great! I knew I would be able to impress you sooner or later.\u201d\u201cWhen have I ever lied to you? It\u2019s only natural that I treat you well.\u201dGu Changge\u2019s face showed his same, unchanged smile as he gently brought Yue Mingkong into his embrace and caressed her hair.He immediately felt her body stiffen, but he couldn\u2019t care less about that. At the same time, his face showed a different expression as he realized that matters weren\u2019t all that different from his expectations.Soon, Yue Mingkong closed her eyes and leaned on Gu Changge\u2019s chest. She never thought that what she desired for innumerable years in her previous life would come so suddenly in this one.Although she knew that Gu Changge was probably putting on an act, she still hoped for time to stop at this moment so they could stay like this forever.\u201cMingkong, don\u2019t you have something to tell me?\u201dRight then, Gu Changge\u2019s voice sounded again.Yue Mingkong kept her silence, and responded with a shake of her head. Right now, she couldn\u2019t show any signs of abnormality.Gu Changge also smiled and didn\u2019t say anything. By now, he had almost figured out the ins and outs of Yue Mingkong\u2019s trope. Although she tried her best to hide it, and pretended to be the same as before, she couldn\u2019t hide her temperament and majesty.In addition, there were still a few flaws in her performance. For example, when he asked her why she was different from before, she visibly showed a shocked expression and panicked for a moment. Although she calmed herself and reverted back to normal immediately, she couldn\u2019t prevent Gu Changge from catching those changes. After all, he wasn\u2019t weak, and could observe even the minutest change in someone.She was still a little wet behind the ears if she thought she could deceive him by putting on an act.But there was one thing Gu Changge couldn\u2019t figure out \u2014 what had led to his fiancee becoming enemies with him in the future, considering she regressed to the past? Why were they not on the same side?Did he abandon her in the future? Or did he betray her? He wanted to know just what went down.Although Gu Changge was a little puzzled, he wasn\u2019t frantic.Still, he didn\u2019t know what Yue Mingkong had experienced, and he was sure that she wouldn\u2019t tell him even if he asked. After all, it involved her biggest secret.Moreover, since she regressed from the future, she must have a good understanding of his methods and nature, so she would be on guard around him, and won\u2019t trust him easily.There was a chance that she even knew that he was an inheritor of the Devil Arts.However, what Gu Changge didn\u2019t guess was that the future Yue Mingkong experienced was one where his mind and actions were thoroughly dominated by his Devil Heart.Right now, he didn\u2019t know how to deal with Yue Mingkong. Although he knew she was a regressor, he couldn\u2019t tell just what she held in her arsenal.What\u2019s more? Her regressing from the future was too much of a cheat! Especially in a place like the Upper Realm, where she had knowledge of everything that might happen in the future, nothing could be hidden from her.Defeating her siblings in the Supreme Immortal Dynasty and getting the position of Crown Princess was obviously not a big deal for a regressor like her!\u201cChangge, how long are you going to hold me?\u201dYue Mingkong had already calmed down by now, and said with a bashful tone that seemed to contain no falsehood. In her heart, however, she was fuming. She felt as if Gu Changge was merely playing with her to see her ugly expression!By now, she was certain that Gu Changge was just like her, and had also regressed from the future. An embrace like this, which wasn\u2019t meant from the bottom of his heart, wasn\u2019t worth melting over.\u201cObviously, I want to hold you for as long as I can.\u201dGu Changge responded with a smile. He felt relieved now that he knew her origins. He could see that Yue Mingkong never expected him to do everything he did, and it was because of this that she was so shocked.In other words, what she experienced in her former life was different from the present.Yue Mingkong didn\u2019t expect such a response from Gu Changge. She wanted to break free from his embrace, but could only let him have his way. Although he was her enemy, it was still a fact that he was also her future husband. She put on a shy and joyful expression, and whispered to him, \u201cChangge, why are you so good to me now?\u201dShe wanted to see how long Gu Changge would pretend.\u2018What does she mean by saying I am good to her now?\u2019He was good to her now? Then how did he treat her in their previous life? Did he beat and curse her?Gu Changge was somewhat stunned as those thoughts spiraled through his heart. But thinking that this question was Yue Mingkong\u2019s test for him, he couldn\u2019t help but say with a smile, \u201cYou are my future wife, so why won\u2019t I be good to you?\u201dYue Mingkong was shocked by his words! Her eyes reddened, and a deep sorrow gripped her heart.Future wife?Did he really think of her as his future wife in their previous life? To him, she was nothing more than a tool that could be thrown away after a single use.He had ruthlessly murdered her on the night of their marriage!\u201cMingkong, what\u2019s wrong? You don\u2019t seem to be well.\u201dGu Changge was surprised by the change in her expression, and he could tell that she wasn\u2019t pretending right now. He wondered why her eyes turned red so suddenly? Did his sentence bring out some sorrow hidden deep down her heart?For a moment, he couldn\u2019t figure out what to say to her.Sure enough, it wasn\u2019t easy to deal with her.\u201cChangge, I feel somewhat uncomfortable. Do forgive Mingkong for not keeping you company anymore.\u201dAs soon as she finished her words, Yue Mingkong broke free from Gu Changge\u2019s embrace, turned around, and left.At the same time, she felt that Gu Changge must already know her biggest secret; no matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t hide the truth from him.Why else would he say such words of humiliation to her right now?Later, he will definitely do everything in his power to deal with her!Gu Changge didn\u2019t say much as he watched Yue Mingkong leave. The smile on his face disappeared, and he stood alone in silence. At the same time, a System Prompt sounded in his mind.[Ding! You have triggered Yue Mingkong\u2019s event. She\u2019s a Favored Daughter of Heaven, the Empress who regressed from the future! Her love for you is as deep as the ocean, but her hatred for you is seated deep in her bones after her past experiences.][You have the following System Tasks to choose from:][ Task 1: Kill the Favored Daughter of Heaven.You will receive 5000 Points of Fortune Value and 25000 Destiny Points.Additional Rewards will be calculated differently.][ Task 2: Subdue the Favored Daughter of Heaven.You will receive 5000 Points of Fortune Value and 25000 Destiny Points.Additional Rewards will be calculated differently.]\u2018What\u2019s the difference?\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but ask.[Ding! You can receive different kinds of help from the System depending on your choice. The additional rewards will also be different in both cases.]\u2018Accept the second task.\u2019Gu Changge directly commanded without giving it much thought. Choosing the first option was simply unrealistic.[2][Ding! Host, you have chosen Task 2! The System will help you by showing you Yue Mingkong\u2019s experience from her past life.]The System suddenly said this, and then Gu Changge felt his vision blur. Soon, a scene appeared in front of his eyes.He found himself in a magnificent palace illuminated by the flickering flame of red candles, and faint moonlight. A woman quietly sat on a bed covered in red. She wore a phoenix crown and a phoenix gown, and sat on the bed with a shy and timid expression.Was this the night of their wedding?Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy as he found himself walking in.Soon, he removed the red veil covering her face.\u201cHusband!\u201dThe woman raised her head to look at him. Her eyebrows jumped in joy, and one could see tenderness in her eyes. But soon, her eyes showed shock and disbelief.[Puff!]With a splash of blood, the scene blurred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, he watched Yue Mingkong\u2019s final moments of shock, puzzlement, disbelief, and sadness.Right now, he was like an outsider watching his body commit murder, but no mantter how he tried, he couldn\u2019t prevent it from succeeding.Soon, the vision of the future disappeared.Gu Changge stood in silence for a moment, and then sighed softly,\u00a0\u201cNo wonder Yue Mingkong couldn\u2019t bear it anymore after she heard those words\u2026\u201dIf someone said such words to him after doing something like that, he would also feel thoroughly humiliated.On the night of her wedding, she was killed by the man she loved the most, and then found herself in the past \u2014 Gu Changge was no stranger to that trope, but it had happened with his fiancee, and dealing with her would be somewhat difficult.\u2018This is certainly what Yue Mingkong experienced before her rebirth; on the night of her wedding, she was killed by my hands, but there\u2019s no way I would do something that insane. Wouldn\u2019t I have to be braindead to do something to such a perfect wife who loves me more than herself?\u2019\u2018From Yue Mingkong\u2019s experience, it\u2019s clear that my mind was completely dominated by the Devil Heart\u2019s demonic nature. Then, that means that I didn\u2019t have the System or my memories of my former life in that timeline.\u2019It didn\u2019t take Gu Changge much thought to figure this out.A cold wind blew on the mountain peak, and then he turned into a divine brilliance and left the scene. Now that he understood the details of her situation, he could try certain solutions to solve this issue.\u2018Speaking of which, this demonic nature sure is trying to screw me over. How many times has it messed with my life now? But then again, it\u2019s something unavoidable, and I can also throw all the blame for my past on the Devil Heart.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s just that Yue Mingkong has already experienced my ruthlessness once, so there\u2019s no way she would believe me easily this time around.\u2019\u2018After all, I have no idea what kind of treatment she received from me on regular days, nor how much she knew.\u2019Gu Changge returned to the Main Hall while thinking of countermeasures on the way. Of course, he didn\u2019t come up with much.After all, it was a fact that Yue Mingkong loved him deeply before, but that wasn\u2019t the case anymore. Once a woman developed hatred towards a man, she would almost go crazy \u2014 her hatred would be seated deep down her bones, and she wouldn\u2019t be willing to accept reason.Worse still? Yue Mingkong had regressed from the future, so she had a lot of knowledge about opportunities and events that would happen in the future. She could take advantage of this knowledge to get every good opportunity, and it wouldn\u2019t be easy to deal with her.Not to mention that she must have a deep understanding of his character and nature.Gu Changge estimated in his heart that his greatest advantage right now was the System, and the fact that he was an anomaly abandoned by the world. Since he was the one in-charge of the body now, the Devil Heart could no longer corrode his nature and reasoning. Many of his worries would be resolved if Yue Mingkong still held some feelings of love for him.At that time, not only will he get massive rewards from the System, but he will also have a regressor wife. It was profit on top of profit.But there was also a chance that Yue Mingkong was hellbent on killing him in this life.\u2018Yue Mingkong didn\u2019t know that the I who killed her is completely different from the I right now, so she must think that everything I did was to trick her.\u2019\u2018She\u2019s a vigilant one!\u2019\u2018On the other hand, the reason she keeps pretending to be the same as before in front of me is probably my current behavior. Since she saw me acting differently from before, she must think that I also regressed just like her, and now she\u2019s worried that I might figure out that she\u2019s also a regressor. It\u2019s just that she couldn\u2019t bear the words I said at the end, so she couldn\u2019t help but run away even if it meant exposing herself.\u2019Gu Changge soon figured out the ins-and-outs of the matter.The most difficult part for him now was that Yue Mingkong wouldn\u2019t easily trust his words and actions. No matter how he explained \u2014 even if he said that the one who killed her was someone completely different, or that he did it because his mind was dominated by the Devil Heart \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t believe him.On the contrary, the more he explained, the deeper her suspicions would get, and she would feel that he was still trying to trick her. Instead of helping, his actions would only result in losses for him.It\u2019s because of this that Gu Changge felt that there was no need to explain anything. The best way out now was to pretend that he didn\u2019t know she was a regressor. As for how he would deal with her? He already had a clear-cut plan in his mind, and only needed to act accordingly.\u2026\u2026[In the Main Hall.]Gu Lintian was all smiles as he discussed some matter of great joy with Emperor Yue. But right then, he saw Yue Mingkong enter the Hall with reddened eyes, and couldn\u2019t help but frown.He wondered what made her cry?With some rage on his face, he asked her, \u201cMingkong, what happened? Did that brat, Changge, bully you again? Tell your Uncle what happened, and Uncle will help you teach him a lesson on your behalf!\u201dHe was well aware of the fact that Gu Changge always treated Yue Mingkong with indifference and disdain, and it was normal for him to bully Yue Mingkong.When it came to Yue Mingkong, their future daughter-in-law, both he and Gu Changge\u2019s mother were very satisfied with her, and obviously couldn\u2019t watch their damned son bully her.What\u2019s more? Gu Changge had already said that his past actions were all the fault of his Devil Heart\u2019s demonic nature, and that he had already solved that issue, and it won\u2019t cause him a problem anymore.So, why did he do this now?\u201cMingkong, what happened?\u201dEmperor Yue also asked when he noticed that his daughter\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t all that good.Over the last half a year or so, Yue Mingkong\u2019s performance and actions had brought him great relief and satisfaction, so he was more worried about her than ever before.Yue Mingkong\u2019s expression soon returned to somewhat normal, and she shook her head and said with a bright smile on her face, \u201cUncle, Father, you are overly worried over nothing. Changge didn\u2019t bully me, it\u2019s just that I was thinking about some past matters, and felt sad over those. Uncle, I am sorry to show you such an embarrassing scene.\u201d\u201cHuh? Changge, that brat, is too much! Mingkong, you mustn\u2019t protect him all the time, or he will bully you even more after you marry him in the future.\u201dGu Lintian couldn\u2019t help but sigh as he heard her response, and hated Gu Changge for his damned actions. Where could they find a daughter-in-law as virtuous and gentle as Yue Mingkong?What\u2019s more? She used an iron fist when dealing with matters, and the Supreme Immortal Dynasty would also fall into her hands in the future. She would be a peerless Empress at that time!There were innumerable favored daughters of heaven in the Upper Realm, but who among them could compare to Yue Mingkong?But that brat, Gu Changge\u2026instead of cherishing her, he made her cry, and bullied her all time. He deserved a thrashing!Although Gu Lintian let Gu Changge do whatever on normal days, right now, he couldn\u2019t help but feel anger towards him in his heart.What would that brat do after they got married?Yue Mingkong responded to his words with a smile, and then shook her head without saying anything.Her greatest secret was already revealed before Gu Changge, so she was afraid that from now on, Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t be able to tolerate her existence. He would never allow someone who knew so many of his secrets to survive in this world, even if the other party was his fiancee.\u201cSo you were here, Mingkong; how are you feeling now?\u201dRight at that moment, Gu Changge\u2019s voice sounded from outside the Main Hall\u2019s gate, with just the right amount of concern lacing his words.Yue Mingkong\u2019s body stiffened as soon as she heard his voice, and it was as if she was about to come face to face with her greatest enemy.But soon, her nerves relaxed.After all, her and Gu Changge\u2019s father were present right here, so he wouldn\u2019t dare to kill her even if he wanted to.\u201cChangge, what\u2019s going on? How dare you bully Mingkong again? How could you make her cry?!\u201dGu Lintian immediately started to scold Gu Changge. He was prepared to give him a beating if his son didn\u2019t give him a good explanation today.Gu Changge acted as if he was taken aback by his words, and then couldn\u2019t help but smile as he said, \u201cFather, what are you talking about? How could I bully Mingkong? She\u2019s my future wife, and I can\u2019t even love her enough, so where would I find the time to bully her?\u201dWith that said, he walked towards Yue Mingkong\u2019s side and took her hand in his hand as if it was only natural.Yue Mingkong had slender and delicate fingers as fine as the most flawless Immortal jade.Yue Mingkong, on the other hand, stood on her spot with a stiff body. She couldn\u2019t comprehend Gu Changge\u2019s actions. Was he trying to deceive their fathers by making it seem like he held deep affection for her in his heart?However, she soon realized that this was the first time Gu Changge held her hand in their two lives, so she couldn\u2019t help but feel her head buzz.\u201cHmph! That better be the case!\u201dGu Lintian gave up the matter with a cold snort after seeing the scene in front of him.\u201cMingkong, do you feel well now? Why were you crying? What happened to you so suddenly?\u201dGu Changge looked at Yue Mingkong\u2019s somewhat stiff figure, and acted as if he didn\u2019t know what caused her current state, and asked with a gentle, affectionate tone. His face appeared even more handsome and graceful as he spoke in a whisper.\u201cI am fine, Changge, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201dYue Mingkong was surprised by Gu Changge\u2019s caring words, but she immediately showed a lovely and natural smile on her face.At least, outsiders wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything unusual between them.She wanted to see just what kind of medicine Gu Changge was trying to sell this time. No matter what, he wouldn\u2019t be able to fool her!It\u2019s just that his actions and expressions were completely new to her. In their past life, he always treated her with indifference, so she never had a chance to see him show such gentleness.How good would it be if he really meant it and wasn\u2019t pretending?She couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her own thoughts, and soon became indifferent.\u2026\u2026Since the Emperor of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty had come to visit them, the Gu Family obviously couldn\u2019t do without a banquet.Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong sat side by side, and appeared to be a pair of Heavenly Immortals made for each other. Those from the younger generation couldn\u2019t help but envy them.At the same time, they secretly cursed Gu Changge as a bastard who wasn\u2019t worthy of Yue Mingkong!Of course, they still remembered Gu Changge\u2019s unparalleled might, so they obviously didn\u2019t have the guts to say anything like that to his face. At most, they cursed him in their hearts. After all, even with all of them combined, they were stomped to the ground like useless rags.Yue Mingkong drank a lot of alcohol and looked intoxicated, so she decided to get up to go to the residence arranged for her by the Gu Family. But right then, Gu Changge held her hand and said with a smile, \u201cMingkong, where are you going? The moonlight looks lovely tonight, so I think you should appreciate it with me for a while.\u201dYue Mingkong\u2019s body stiffened once again.\u201cHaha, it seems the young man can\u2019t wait anymore\u2026\u201dEmperor Yue, Gu Lintian, and the others couldn\u2019t help but laugh with somewhat ambiguous expressions when they saw the scene before them, and then all of them decided to leave the surroundings.Although Gu Changge\u2019s actions appeared a bit over-the-top, they could understand him. After all, he was a young man, and he also drank quite a few glasses.The surroundings quietened down fast.Only Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong were left on the scene now.\u201cMingkong, the night is long, so why don\u2019t you accompany me and drink a few more glasses?\u201dGu Changge said with an intoxicated tone.A deep and indifferent expression appeared on Yue Mingkong\u2019s face, and her beautiful and gentle smile from before disappeared. She finally brought out her majestic aura of an Empress, and said with a sneer, \u201cGu Changge, everyone has already left, so you don\u2019t need to pretend anymore\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you have changed so much? Could it be that you had always been pretending to be kind and obedient? I never realized you had such means\u2026\u201dGu Changge immediately cut her off with his own counterattack. At the same time, he pretended to not hear her words, and sat there with a drink still in his hands, and an unwell expression.Yue Mingkong was immediately taken aback by his words, and didn\u2019t understand what Gu Changge meant.She had changed so much? Was he talking about what she did in the past six months?It seemed that Gu Changge didn\u2019t know about her regression\u2026So, everything he did today was to find out the reason behind her sudden change?Yue Mingkong couldn\u2019t help but heave a sigh of relief as she came to this realization. It turned out that Gu Changge wasn\u2019t a regressor like her, contrary to her previous thoughts. Otherwise, he would never reveal anything about his regression, and then ask her such a question at this time.Right at that moment, Yue Mingkong\u2019s expression changed, and she felt a strong force of oppression descend upon her from the Void.Gu Changge had attacked her![Buzz!]She quickly reacted and countered with an attack of her own. She made some seals with her hand, and a brilliant light appeared around her figure. At the same time, a rune condensed in her palm, and took the shape of a mighty crescent that shot towards the incoming attack!She had spent the past six months looking for all kinds of Fortuitous Encounters, so her cultivation had already reached the pinnacle of the Conferred Lord Realm. She could even break through to the Conferred King Realm at any time now, as she already had one foot into its doors.But what surprised her was the fact that Gu Changge\u2019s cultivation was even more overpowered than her own! She clearly remembered that in her previous life, Gu Changge was only in the early stage of the Conferred Lord Realm around this time.She didn\u2019t panic, however. She knew many of Gu Changge\u2019s means, and was on her guard, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to take her down.\u201cPinnacle of the Conferred Lord Realm? Mingkong, you seem to be hiding a lot from your husband, eh.\u201dThe scene in front of him surprised Gu Changge for a moment, but then he lifted his palm, and terrifying golden runes turned into massive mountains and seas that blocked the crescent thrown at him by Yue Mingkong!At the same time, he reached out with his hand and closed his palm, using his Void Talent at the same time. The Void in front of him buzzed, and he could control it as he pleased.\u201cAh! Gu Changge, what are you doing? Let go of me!\u201dYue Mingkong exclaimed in the next moment.She felt something grip her body as the Void around her froze. In the next moment, she found herself in Gu Changge\u2019s arms. The gentle expression he previously showed was long gone, and what replaced it was the indifference she was familiar with, with a little playfulness showing in his eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201dYue Mingkong\u2019s heart shuddered. She never thought that Gu Changge could control the Void; this was something completely out of her expectations.Soon, a golden figure in the depths of her Sea of Consciousness shone with a brilliant light. Chants of the Dao sounded in the surroundings, and it was as if the figure wanted to kill Gu Changge.However, Gu Changge seemed to have long been prepared for this, and a brilliance of his own exploded from his Sea of Consciousness. The Innate God\u2019s eyes showed indifference as devilish Qi wrapped around its body, and it directly blocked the effect of Yue Mingkong\u2019s Dao technique.Yue Mingkong\u2019s expression turned solemn. The methods Gu Changge used right now were far beyond her expectations, and she had never seen him use such means in their previous life.This made her wonder if the Gu Changge in front of her was even the same person as the Gu Changge in her previous life? Or could it be that something had changed?\u201cMingkong, are you still not going to confess the truth before your husband?\u201dGu Changge asked with an expression of intrigue, and no longer made any more moves.Yue Mingkong, on the other hand, was puzzled and couldn\u2019t understand why Gu Changge suddenly stopped. In her impression, Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t stop at anything until he achieved his goal.Could it be that he really only wanted to know why she had changed so much over the last half a year or so?Yue Mingkong breathed a sigh of relief as she thought about this.With that, she said frankly, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I won\u2019t hide it from you anymore, Changge. The me you saw before was a facade made to please you, but I don\u2019t want to do that anymore. People like you are cold-hearted, and will never be moved by anyone, so why must I keep on embarrassing myself?\u201dHer words were the truth mixed with some lies, and she could easily conceal the fact of her regression with this.Gu Changge wanted to praise her for her ingenuity, but showed no change in his expression.\u201cOh? How do you know I won\u2019t be moved by anyone?\u201dHe asked in return.Yue Mingkong struggled in his arms, but realized that she couldn\u2019t escape, so she gave up on moving. She didn\u2019t even want to open her mouth at that question from Gu Changge.She had proved those words in her past life, so how could she not know that he won\u2019t be moved by anyone?Still, Yue Mingking felt relieved after confirming that Gu Changge hadn\u2019t regressed with her.This Gu Changge was the Gu Changge she was familiar with. That gentle appearance and speech before was nothing more than a facade he put on to get the truth out of her mouth.Fortunately, she was skilled enough and could fool him with her statement. With that, she was able to keep her secret about regression to herself.\u201cSo that\u2019s how you thought of your husband all this time? The fact that you had been pretending all these years sure makes my heart ache a bit.\u201dGu Changge said with a rueful smile.\u201cGu Changge, don\u2019t you know well what kind of personality you have?\u201dYue Mingkong said with a cold snort. Anyway, she had already torn all face with Gu Changge, so she couldn\u2019t care less about matters anymore.Right now, they were in the Gu Family, so she didn\u2019t believe Gu Changge dared do anything too drastic to her.Gu Changge gave no response to her words, and brought her to his palace. On the way, many people from the Family saw them like that, and couldn\u2019t help but show knowing smiles.\u201cGu Changge, what are you doing?!\u201dYue Mingkong fell into a daze, and felt her head buzz in confusion.\u201cWhat else can I do when the night is so long?\u201dGu Changge replied with a\u00a0shady\u00a0mysterious smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had made countless calculations and imagined many ways that Gu Changge might use to deal with her, but she never expected him to do something like this.Didn\u2019t he hate her beyond measure in their past life? He hated her so much that he wouldn\u2019t even touch her, or why would he kill her in cold blood on the night of their wedding without even doing anything to her before that?Yue Mingkong\u2019s mind was in a mess right now. From the moment of her rebirth, she had never been in so much confusion.Originally, she had a lot of methods that she could use to get rid of Gu Changge, but her initial counter failed, and she decided not to do anything more as they weren\u2019t in a desolate place. She could only let Gu Changge hold her in his embrace, and bring her to his bed deep in his palace.Yue Mingkong couldn\u2019t help but tense up. She had never encountered such a situation in her two lives. She couldn\u2019t understand why Gu Changge would do something like this?She simply couldn\u2019t make sense of anything right now. From her understanding of Gu Changge, there was no way Gu Changge would do something like this. Could it be that her regression had caused the world to undergo certain changes that she couldn\u2019t estimate?Could Gu Changge have also changed as a result of her regression?Various thoughts went through Yue Mingkong\u2019s mind, and she felt even more lightheaded. She couldn\u2019t understand Gu Changge\u2019s thoughts, nor could she make sense of what was going through her own mind right now.\u201cHaiz! Mingkong, I think you have always misunderstood your husband!\u201dGu Changge said with a smirk, and stared at Yue Mingkong\u2019s gorgeous, fairy-like face and disbelief-filled eyes.\u201cGu Changge, you\u2026\u201dRight now, Yue Mingkong was in an extremely complicated mood. She couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on, nor did she want to worry about all that right now.Naturally, she hated Gu Changge, and her hatred for him was seated deep down her bones\u2026but at the same time, she loved him more than anything else, too!In the end, no words were spoken between them through the night.[Seggs that was never written.]\u2026\u2026[The next day.]Yue Mingkong was already gone by the time Gu Changge woke up. As he glanced at the tidied up bed, he reckoned that Yue Mingkong was the one who took away the beddings from last night.At the same time, a System Prompt sounded in his mind.[Ding! You have shaken the murderous heart of the Favored Daughter of Heaven, Yue Mingkong! You have received 500 Points of Fortune Value and 2500 Points of Destiny Points!]Gu Changge\u2019s expression showed some interest, and then he couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud.Matters were naturally heading in the direction of his choice. Right now, Yue Mingkong was most likely drowned in doubts and thinking that the him right now was different from the him she knew in her previous life. She was probably thinking that the current him wasn\u2019t all that bad.Women were suspicious creatures by nature \u2014 whether they be the emotional type, or the extremely rational type.As for how suspicious they were? As long as they could find a little clue, they could guess a lot of things from it. It was the same as their brain filling in the blanks with what it desired most.Yue Mingkong was no exception to this.\u2018The issue is resolved for now, but I will need to spend a lot of time if I want to completely subdue Yue Mingkong.\u2019Gu Changge thought to himself as he walked out of his palace.Yue Mingkong, on the other hand, avoided him with her full might. Be it at breakfast, the farewell banquet, or the moment when their entourage left, she didn\u2019t show herself even once.Gu Changge wasn\u2019t surprised by her actions, but he wondered how long she could hide herself like this?As the saying went:\u00a0\u2018you can hide for a day, but you can\u2019t hide for a lifetime!\u2019They had a lot of time ahead of them, so he wasn\u2019t in any hurry to see her.On the other hand, Gu Changge was preparing to return to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. He had already been away from the Palace for more than half a year now. Although he was a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and even had the Ancient Immortal Gu Family backing him, these statuses could only help him shut people from speaking against him in public.In the shadows, there were still a lot of people dissatisfied with him.What\u2019s more? The power structure inside the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was far more intricate than the Gu Family. Almost every person in the Palace had the shadow of a major Heritage behind them.The Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was the place where the mighty existences of the Upper Realm played their true games and schemes.\u2026\u2026[The Supreme Immortal Dynasty\u2019s entourage on its way back.]Yue Mingkong sat cross-legged inside a divine carriage made of black gold, which was pulled by a group of nine phoenixes. She seemed to be in a trance, and one could see some worry clouding her face.The maid who served her couldn\u2019t help but tremble at the side, and didn\u2019t dare make as much as a peep. Yue Mingkong was in a strange state when she saw her in the morning. She appeared to be gnashing her teeth, and a gloomy aura surrounded her. She looked completely different from the indifferent, majestic, and supreme Crown Princess she was used to serving every day.The sudden change in her mistress\u2019 behavior shook her down to her core, and she worried for her life and did her best not to offend her mistress.After all, she was well aware of how Yue Mingkong had obtained her current position of Crown Princess. Her mistress was an extremely ruthless woman who crushed many with an iron fist, and executed countless people around her. When asked for a reason, she said that she did it because she felt like it.Those incidents were still fresh in her mind, and she feared that she might end up like those people if she wasn\u2019t careful.Yue Mingkong was never like this before.Right then, Yue Mingkong seemed to have gotten tired of thinking. She rubbed her glabella, and asked her servant with a tone full of majesty, \u201cHuan\u2019er, what do you think of Young Master Changge? What kind of person is he?\u201dThe maid named Huan\u2019er trembled in fear as she heard her question.\u201cCrown Princess, I dare not speak anything about Young Master Changge!\u201dShe responded with a trembling voice.She would only dare talk behind Yue Mingkong\u2019s future husband\u2019s back in front of her if she was tired of living. Huan\u2019er knew she was not tired of living.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, you have my permission!\u201dYue Mingkong gave her a cold glare.Huan\u2019er gritted her teeth and resolved herself after seeing her glare at her, and said, \u201cFrom what this servant saw, Young Master Changge and Your Excellency are a match made in Heaven. You two look like an Immortal couple when you stand beside each other. Besides that, Young Master Changge has unparalleled talent, and he will also be the one in-charge of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family in the future!\u201d\u201cAlthough there are a lot of rumors circulating in the outside world that claim that Young Master Changge is a ruthless person who isn\u2019t easy to talk to, I feel that the rumors might be false. From what this servant saw, Young Master Changge has a gentle temperament, and no matter who conversed with him, they would feel as if a tender spring breeze was caressing them!\u201dYue Mingkong waved her hand and let her stop in her tracks after listening to this much. She didn\u2019t say anything, but her expression turned even colder and a deep glint flashed through her eyes.Gentle temperament? That\u2019s just what Gu Changge showed in front of others.As for tenderness? How come she didn\u2019t feel any from him last night?\u00a0( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)Yue Mingkong couldn\u2019t help but clench the bedding in her hand even tighter as she thought about this. A glaring plum could be seen blooming on the bedding.\u2018Gu Changge, it turns out that even I, who has lived two lives, can\u2019t see through you at all!\u2019Yue Mingkong had a complicated expression.On this trip to the Gu Family, a lot of things had happened that were completely out of her expectations. She had thought that she would be able to play Gu Changge in the palm of her hand, but contrary to her expectations, the one who got played was her.She was completely dancing in the palm of his hand!All the advantages that she obtained through her regression failed in front of Gu Changge.\u2018This is even more reason for me to not let you go; Gu Changge, I will repay you all the pain and anguish you inflicted upon me!\u2019\u2026\u2026[Upper Realm, Outer Region, Land of Forsaken Immortals.]An endless, ancient mountain range towered into the sky, and ancient trees covered with wines stood around like hills. Dark clouds shrouded the sky, giving the entire place an ancient and unfathomable appearance. Terrifying beasts roamed around everywhere, and one could hear roars and rumbles that resembled the sound of massive doors screeching against each other.Yan Ji had already reached the depths of the Land of Forsaken Immortals.Right now, she stood atop a towering tree and watched a small and mysterious village in the distance. The sky above the village was shrouded in a layer of fog and frost. Whenever a fierce beast passed by the village, it showed an extremely cautious expression, and rushed past the village at its top speed.When the beasts looked at the village, they showed extremely fearful and respectful expressions.\u2018How did the Young Master know that there would be such a mysterious village in the depths of this Forbidden Land, and with that mysterious Peach Tree at that?\u2019\u2018Also, why does this tree resemble the tree rumored in ancient records? Didn\u2019t it disappear many epochs ago?\u2019Yan Ji showed a solemn expression, and carefully hid her aura.Although she was already in the Great Sacred Realm, she couldn\u2019t help but panic at this moment, and tread with care.No matter how she looked at the mysterious village, she could tell that it wasn\u2019t simple. There was something terrifying about that village!What\u2019s more? Gu Changge had cautioned her to immediately use the [Domain Traversing Talisman] if she felt even the slightest threat to her life.[Swoosh!]Yan Ji\u2019s expression suddenly changed as she heard the sound of something cutting through the air at an extreme speed. Within a moment, whatever that thing was, it reached her.It was a peach blossom! It was an extremely brilliant and gorgeous peach blossom, but right now, it resembled the blade of a supreme Immortal sword! Terrifying force of suppression descended upon her, and it was as if the peach blossom could cut through the Universe as it slashed towards her![Boom!]The Void split open at once, and horrible cracks appeared in the surrounding space. It was an extremely terrifying spatial tear that she wasn\u2019t able to resist with her current strength.Yan Ji\u2019s expression paled, and she used the [Domain Traversing Talisman] without any hesitation. The Talisman in her hand shone with a brilliant, destructive light and various runes appeared around it.[Buzz!]The Void in front of her blurred, and then a spatial tunnel appeared out of nowhere. Without any hesitation, Yan Ji escaped into it. Her reaction was extremely quick, but she still spurted a mouthful of blood as some of the might of that attack reached her!But before it could completely hit her, the opening of the spatial tunnel behind her closed. Still, she suffered serious injuries just from that partial attack.Fortunately, she was able to take advantage of the spatial tunnel, and disappeared from the Land of Forsaken Immortals soon.[Hundreds of thousands of miles away, in another piece of space.]Yan Ji\u2019s figure suddenly appeared from the Void. Fear lingered in her heart, and she couldn\u2019t help but break out in cold sweat as she recalled the terror of the attack that almost obliterated her.\u2018If not for the [Domain Traversing Talisman] given to me by the Young Master, I would have ended up six-feet under right then and there. The Land of Forsaken Immortals is too mysterious and dangerous.\u2019\u2018I must ask the Young Master to watch out for it and pay attention to the movements in there. He must be looking for this Peach Village, so I must go back as soon as possible and inform him.\u2019Yan Ji\u2019s figure disappeared as she thought of this, and she headed towards the Inner Region of the Upper Realm.The Upper Realm was extremely vast, and even a Great Sacred Realm master like her would need decades just to traverse across the Outer Region. Without the Teleportation Formations or Spatial Tunnels that connected far away lands, ordinary cultivators could never leave the area they were born in for the rest of their lives.\u2026\u2026[Back in the Land of Forsaken Immortals.]The extremely luxuriant peach tree gently swayed outside the Peach Village. It\u2019s peach blossoms looked extremely gorgeous, and every petal seemed to be carved out of Immortal jade as they shimmered with incomparable beauty.\u201cTo think she would be able to escape\u2026it seems that I was too careless. Who would have thought that she possessed a [Domain Traversing Talisman]\u2026\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t have the aura of the Gu Family on her body, so she shouldn\u2019t have come here for Xian\u2019er; just who could she be then?\u201d\u201cIt seems that the tranquility of the Peach Village will soon be broken after such a long time.\u201dThe melodious voice of the peach tree rang in the surroundings, but it soon fell silent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gu Changge had almost guessed Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s background from the news Yan Ji brought back.The trope she followed didn\u2019t seem to be all that different from his expectations.After all, a transmigrator like him was more than familiar with the tropes of bone-digging, a mysterious village, and an ancient peach tree.Now, he held no doubt about the fact that there was a mysterious, mighty figure behind Gu Xian\u2019er.What\u2019s more? Yan Ji described that the mysterious village was shrouded in a chaotic fog and frost, and she felt many strange auras from inside it. It went to show that the village had more than just a peach tree in its arsenal.Gu Changge reached various conclusions after thinking about the matter for a while. Considering that the Land of Forsaken Immortals was a barren wasteland in the Upper Realm, then the presence of a mysterious village in such a wasteland might just mean that Gu Xian\u2019er had some mighty masters with maimed limbs or something\u2026So what did the merging of these two tropes mean?Well, Gu Changge wasn\u2019t all that worried about these matters. After all, Gu Xian\u2019er was just a little girl, and he had many ways to deal with little girls.Once he figured out Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s whereabouts and destination, he will be able to deal with her better. For now, he prepared to return to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.Although he was the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family now, the one who held all authority was still his father.Furthermore, there wasn\u2019t much for him to do in the Gu Family, so it was better for him to return to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace to plot further.[Upper Realm, Inner Region, Immeasurable Heaven.]As the most prosperous area closest to the Upper Realm\u2019s central region, the Immeasurable Heaven hid countless secret realms and opportunities. The number of talented geniuses born from this place\u00a0 \u2014 who could shock the geniuses of the past and the present \u2014 couldn\u2019t be estimated.Since time immemorial, this region was the most prosperous region for all Races and Heritages that had existed since times forgotten. All Ancient Immortal Families, Ancient Immortal Sects, and Supreme Orthodoxies and Dynasties could trace their roots back to this place.The Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was a behemoth of the Immeasurable Heaven, with an extremely mysterious and long heritage. It had stood tall and Immortal through multiple epochs. Some cultivators even believed that the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace possessed real Immortal Scriptures and Inscriptions, and even held the method of achieving true Immortality in their hands.There were countless such rumors floating around in the Upper Realm.The composition of forces inside the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was extremely complicated. Almost all the heritages of the Upper Realm had their shadow behind the people inside the Dao Palace. After all, the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was open to people of all races and heritages.[Right now, in front of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s magnificent gate.]Droves of cultivators passed through this place. One could see creatures of all races here. There were those with wings on their backs, those with horns on top of their heads, those with red eyes and silver scales, and those with oppressive auras\u2026Many among them were disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace who rode atop pure-bred, mighty beasts as mounts. Right now, some were leaving the Palace while others were returning from outside.At the foot of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s entrance was a huge square market. Right now, various lively voices resounded around the market.\u201cDoes anyone want the pictures of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s top ten beauties? They are the ten most amazing women! Young heroes, don\u2019t you want to catch a glimpse of their sacred visage? All of them are peerless fairies waiting to meet you!\u201d\u201cI have a Heaven-defying cultivation technique that fell from Heaven after an ancient Immortal lost it. Not only in this world, but even up there, it\u2019s invincible! This is an opportunity that might never come again, so don\u2019t miss it while it lasts!\u201d\u201cI have the record left behind by the Divine Sun Sparrow! The highest bid can obtain it right away. Although it\u2019s an incomplete record, it can take you to the peak of the Fire Dao in one fell swoop! Get it to take a glimpse of the true Fire Dao, and step on the road to the pinnacle of the Fire Dao!\u201d\u201cI have a Quasi-Supreme Herb. This ancient medicine has grown unhindered for eighty-thousand years, and it will soon turn into a Supreme Herb! Interested parties can compete and bid for it! It\u2019s a rare treasure herb!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t miss, don\u2019t miss! Take a look, take a look!\u201d\u2026\u2026A slender girl dressed in blue slightly frowned as she watched the scenes in her surroundings. A large, red bird rested on her shoulder.The girl was none other than Gu Xian\u2019er!After many twists and turns, she traveled through innumerable Teleportation Formations, and finally arrived all the way to the Inner Region of the Upper Realm from the Outer Region of the Upper Realm.Only when she arrived here did she realize what it meant to see a truly prosperous region where all races lived together.She also saw for the first time just how vast the Upper Realm was!On the way, she met many youths who claimed to be heavenly geniuses, but all of them were stomped on by her without even forcing her to bring out her full might.\u201cAre these things real or fake? Surely, no one would have the guts to sell fake stuff right at the gate of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, right?\u201dThe more she listened to the cries of the peddlers, the more Gu Xian\u2019er felt that she was missing out on great opportunities. She felt entangled in her heart, but couldn\u2019t do anything about it as she didn\u2019t possess much wealth.The red bird on her shoulder couldn\u2019t help but roll its eyes as it listened to her grumbles. Usually, this girl would be the smartest of the lot, but her mind would shut down as soon as she came across\u00a0\u2018Heavenly Treasures!\u2019Gu Xian\u2019er walked throughout the market with furrowed brows.She watched as people exchanged various treasures, listened to the sounds of people eating and drinking, and the endless chatter of those who were trying to sell their goods.All the sounds made her head buzz. She wanted to buy a lot of stuff, but she was poor, so how could she afford anything?She was extremely poor!Her several masters back in the Peach Village had given her a lot of good things, but what none of them gave her was money! All of her travel expenses were gathered by swatting flies[1] along the way.[1: read \u2018Young Geniuses.\u2019]So now that she watched such a prosperous scenery in front of her, she couldn\u2019t contain her greed.Other geniuses were followed by a large group of servants, while she only had one old servant accompanying her\u2026neither of them had any money either. Gu Xian\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but gnash her teeth, and decided to put this on her\u00a0\u2018good\u2019\u00a0brother\u2019s tab as well. She now had more reasons to hate him.Near the square market was a huge ancient city called the Heavenly Dao Ancient City. Although it was said to be an ancient city, it was actually a union of multiple smaller cities without boundaries, since boundaries were kind of useless here.Many small cities had joined together and created an ancient city that surpassed many other giant cities of the Upper Realm. The Heavenly Dao Ancient City covered an extremely vast territory.Of course, the Heavenly Dao Ancient City had no walls or such either, and cultivators could come and go as they pleased. After all, the city was right next to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, so why would it need walls and defense?Who would dare come to this place and run rampant? Only a brain-dead fool, or someone looking for death would do something like that.\u201cMy Lady, how about we go to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace and look for the Great Elder first?\u201dGu Xian\u2019er\u2019s servant felt distressed as he watched his Lady\u2019s greedy gaze, and couldn\u2019t help but try to shift her attention. He blamed himself for being useless and not accumulating much wealth in his life. His Lady wouldn\u2019t have suffered if he was more useful.\u201cAlright, Uncle Fu, let\u2019s find the Great Elder first.\u201dGu Xian\u2019er noticed her old servant\u2019s expression, and immediately toned down her greed and agreed with him. The old servant called Uncle Fu had looked after her for more than a decade, so he was like a member of her own family to her; there was no way Gu Xian\u2019er wouldn\u2019t consider his feelings.Right then, the crowd in front of her showed a drastic change in their expressions, and everyone hurriedly stepped aside. At the same time, several men with arrogant expressions walked through.In their midst walked a handsome man with a calm face, and a folding fan. The handsome man wore a golden long coat, and he had several horns on his head. His horns seemed to be carved from Immortal gold, and they gave off the charm of the Great Dao.A flash of surprise passed through his eyes as he saw Gu Xian\u2019er.\u2018Immortal Bones, Fairy-like beauty, and natural and pure temperament\u2026although this girl is a little young, she will surely grow up to be a stunning beauty who could result in the downfall of nations with a single wink. I never thought the world still had girls like her!\u2019The eyes of the man in the golden long coat turned fiery as he immediately noticed Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s extraordinariness in the crowd. It was because of this that he walked over to her to have a closer look.As soon as he took a closer look, he was stunned. He had a Mystical Eye Technique that allowed him to see through people. One glance was enough for him to tell about their talent, cultivation, and so on\u2026As soon as he used his Mystical Eye Technique to take a look at Gu Xian\u2019er, he realized that the girl dressed in blue was an incredible specimen. Be it her talent, spirit, or aptitude, few could match her!He watched her closely for a while, and realized that the girl didn\u2019t seem to be from a great background. From her simple and plain clothing, and the old and weak servant behind her, he concluded that she wasn\u2019t even from the Inner Region of the Upper Realm.He could tell that she had traveled long and hard to reach this place.Various thoughts went through the mind of the man in the golden long coat, and then he said to Gu Xian\u2019er with a smile, \u201cThis one is Jin Yu, and I wonder what the Lady\u2019s name might be? I saw that the Lady seemed to be interested in some of the things just now, so I\u2026\u201dAs she heard his words, Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s calm expression turned cold, and she directly interrupted his speech, \u201cNo need, I am not interested in anything here, so Young Master doesn\u2019t need to bother with anything.\u201dShe had thought that something was wrong with this guy, and she was correct. Wasn\u2019t he the same as those bastards on the way who lusted after her body?Overly courteous people often hid evil intentions!This was what her Masters always told her.As soon as the handsome man in the golden long coat heard her words, his face froze. He felt embarrassed, but more than that, he felt sullen and enraged. He lowered his face to speak to her, yet this b!7ch actually refused to appreciate his favor!\u201cLittle wench, do you know who I am?\u201dJin Yu couldn\u2019t be bothered to pretend anymore, and directly revealed his true face, and questioned her with a lustful and frivolous expression.The cultivators nearby were already scared when they saw the man in the golden long coat. Those who could come to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace were all talented people with extraordinary backgrounds \u2014 ordinary cultivators didn\u2019t have the qualifications to step foot into this place.What\u2019s more? There were Law Enforcement Disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace patrolling the surroundings and keeping everything in check, so no one dared cause any trouble on normal days.Everyone had some background, so why would one be afraid of another?It\u2019s just that this man named Jin Yu was somewhat different. Not only was his brother a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, but he also had a powerful Elder of the Palace backing them.What\u2019s more? The Race that stood behind Jin Yu wasn\u2019t minor either \u2014 he was from the Ancient Immortal Golden Horn Race!Many people knew him, so no one dared to provoke him.\u201cWho gives a damn about who you are? If you don\u2019t want something to happen to you, then you better not block my path!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er frowned and said with an unhappy expression. She wasn\u2019t afraid of this golden-horned man blocking her way. It\u2019s just that she didn\u2019t want to cause trouble right at the foot of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.On the way here, she had warned herself multiple times to keep a low profile, so as to not be noticed by Gu Changge.\u201cHehe, you refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit! Little girl, it seems you haven\u2019t witnessed the reality of life, and don\u2019t know who you should and shouldn\u2019t provoke!\u201dJin Yu\u2019s expression was as cold as a glacier\u2019s peak, and he waved towards the servants behind him to take down this ignorant girl to teach her a lesson!Gu Xian\u2019er wasn\u2019t afraid of him and his cronies, and her temperature also fell further. At the same time, terrifying golden runes condensed in the palm of her hand.[ROAR!!!]But suddenly, an earth-shattering roar of dragons resounded throughout the Heavens. Nine massive dragons that could cover the sun and shroud the earth flew towards the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace like behemoth mountains.Behind the nine disastrous dragons was a snow-white, jade carriage that galloped through the Void. Driving the carriage was an old man with an uninterested expression on his face.The word \u2018GU\u2019 was written on the carriage in bold and awe-inspiring calligraphy. As soon as the people outside the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace saw the dragon-led carriage, their expressions changed, and they couldn\u2019t help but ask with trembling voices, \u201cThat Young Master is back?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had returned!\u2019Many rumors about Gu Changge floated in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. Reincarnation of a True Immortal, Descendent of a God, Darling of the Dao, and such names were given to him by the world. One couldn\u2019t even estimate his future achievements, and it was hard to tell just what heights he might reach.Some Elders of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace held great expectations for Gu Changge, and believed that he was the most suitable candidate for the position of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s future heir.The five True Disciples, and the rest of the ordinary Disciples greatly envied him, and their jealousy for him was through the roof.Many cultivators in the world knew of these matters.What\u2019s more? Gu Changge had shown extraordinary talent from a young age, and he was known as\u00a0\u2018the Young Supreme!\u2019\u00a0From the moment he appeared in the world to now, he had never encountered defeat. On the contrary, many had tasted utter defeat in his hands \u2014 even geniuses from many major Heritages of the Upper Realm.All-in-all, Gu Changge was an extremely brilliant star that shone with incomparable brightness in the Upper Realm, and people couldn\u2019t help but turn their heads towards him no matter where he went.If that wasn\u2019t enough, then Gu Changge\u2019s identity as the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family was already comparable to the identity of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s heir!As the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was a special existence in the Upper Realm, many Immortal Dynasties, Families, Sects, and Races would send their disciples and descendants to fight for power inside it.Although it wasn\u2019t something uncommon, Gu Changge joining the Palace was still enough to attract the attention of every force in the world.Some time ago, they heard that Gu Changge suddenly left the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and that shocked many cultivators. He had disappeared for a full half a year, and many couldn\u2019t help but wonder where he might have gone off to?Many in the world were interested in the whereabouts of Young Supremes, and would pay any price to keep an eye on them at all times.So now that Gu Changge finally appeared here, how could the people not be surprised and in a turmoil? They keenly watched the nine dragons soaring above them, and discussed him among themselves.\u201cGu Changge finally came back after disappearing for half a year!\u201d\u201cWhere did he even go?\u201dThe man in gold named\u00a0Gold Universe\u00a0Jin Yu was also attracted towards Gu Changge, and couldn\u2019t help but frown. Gu Changge was someone he didn\u2019t want to see since even his older brother had no choice but to cower before him.Naturally, he held no good feelings towards Gu Changge.However, what he didn\u2019t notice was Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s expression. Her already cold expression fell further, and she couldn\u2019t suppress the hatred she felt for Gu Changge. A terrible aura surged around her figure, and her eyes flashed with a terrifying glint as brilliant runes began appearing around her.\u201cMy Lady!\u201dThe old servant next to Gu Xian\u2019er called out to her with a nudge \u2014 he was worried that she might do something impulsive.There was no doubt that Gu Xian\u2019er knew who was sitting inside that carriage. The only one who dared go into the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace in such a high-profile manner was her\u00a0\u2018good\u2019\u00a0elder brother, the one she hated the most.Her Dao Bone was inside him still, and the two shared a sort of inexplicable link, so how could she not feel his presence?After more than a decade, she got to see him again. Immediately, she felt the bone-ripping pain she felt back when he ruthlessly dug out her Dao Bone.\u201cMy Lady, we still haven\u2019t found the Great Elder, so you mustn\u2019t attract his attention. The Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace is like his own backyard\u2026\u201dThe old servant persuaded her.Gu Xian\u2019er understood his worries, and nodded in response, and calmed herself down as soon as possible. Sooner or later, she would have her revenge!\u201cCome here, and deal with this wench who doesn\u2019t know the immensity of the Heavens and the vastness of the Earth!\u201dJin Yu\u2019s expression turned cold, and he turned towards Gu Xian\u2019er and commanded his cronies.A bunch of his strong servants with horns and scales walked forward.Gu Xian\u2019er watched them coldly. She didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble here, but trouble came knocking at her door. She couldn\u2019t recall just how many such fools she had stomped on her way here.[ROAR!!!]Right then, the roar of the dragons came from the sky once more, and shocked all the onlookers.\u201cRun! He\u2019s coming towards us.\u201dThey couldn\u2019t help but scream out when they found the carriage led by nine dragons returning after it had already entered the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. Not only was it heading towards their location, but it was descending as if trying to ram into them.\u2018Oh, no! He must have felt my presence!\u2019Gu Xian\u2019er immediately figured this out and her expression fell. Nothing else could explain why Gu Changge would return and head towards her specific direction when he had already gone inside the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.\u201cWhy is that Gu Changge coming towards this place?\u201dJin Yu\u2019s expression also turned ugly as he saw the disturbance. He couldn\u2019t understand why Gu Changge was coming in his direction?Was he here for him?After all, he and Gu Changge knew each other and already had sort of a grudge between them. Because of his brother, he had come across Gu Changge multiple times in the past.For a moment, his face turned gloomy and he showed an expression of uncertainty.\u201cMy Lady, we must leave right now!\u201dThe old servant\u2019s complexion also paled, and he hurriedly persuaded Gu Xian\u2019er.Gu Xian\u2019er, on the other hand, calmed down and shook her head in response, \u201cWe can\u2019t leave anymore. Anyway, we must face him sooner or later, so why not do it right now?\u201dShe never expected to meet Gu Changge so soon, but she couldn\u2019t care about anything anymore.The cultivators in the square market turned their attention towards their side. Before, only a few were watching the excitement, but now, everyone was riled up and wondered about what was to come.\u201cYoung Master Gu Changge is going to show up here? Is this a miracle?\u201d\u201cCould he be coming here because of Jin Yu? I heard his elder brother was injured by Young Master Gu, and suffered some heavy injuries!\u201dThe nearby cultivators discussed among themselves.Soon, the dragons and the carriage landed, and the gentle and pleasant voice of a man sounded from the jade carriage.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen each other for a long time\u2026it seems you have been doing quite well!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Gu is exaggerating! No matter how well I have been, how can I compare to you?\u201dJin Yu was taken aback when he heard Gu Changge\u2019s unexpected words. But since Gu Changge was greeting him in kind, he could only show a smile, and respond back in kind.\u201cAfter a decade of separation, I see that you have grown up to be a tall and slender beauty.\u201dHis words didn\u2019t stop, and Gu Changge also walked out of the carriage at this time with a strange look in his eyes. It was as if he was speaking to himself, and didn\u2019t even pay attention to Jin Yu, who he passed by.Jin Yu\u2019s face froze as he heard his words, and his expression turned sullen and ugly. He felt humiliated!The nearby cultivators were also taken aback and left in shock. Those words were surely not directed at Jin Yu, so could he be talking to that girl in blue?Gu Xian\u2019er naturally knew that Gu Changge was talking to her, but her pretty face showed a cold expression, and she didn\u2019t utter a single word in response \u2014 she merely glared daggers at him.\u201cGu Changge, what do you mean by that?!\u201dJin Yu almost lost his mind as he watched Gu Changge completely ignore his existence and pass by. He had lost all face, so he couldn\u2019t help but shout towards him to get back some of his lost prestige.After all, the embarrassment just now wasn\u2019t light. Gu Changge wasn\u2019t even talking to him, yet he greeted him as if they were on good terms \u2014 Jin Yu felt his face burn.\u201cWhat the heck are you? Don\u2019t you see I am talking to my little sister? How dare you interrupt our reunion?\u201dGu Changge finally glanced at him, and said with an indifferent and disdainful tone.\u201cYOU!!!\u201dJin Yu\u2019s figure halted for a moment, and then his expression turned even more ugly and gloomy as he trembled in rage.Gu Changge couldn\u2019t care less about this nobody. He turned to continue looking at Gu Xian\u2019er. He had also not expected that he would sense Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s existence at the foot of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace right when he returned, and that was why he let Old Ming drive him back.Anyway, there was no harm in greeting her right now, even if that angered her. Her cultivation was too far behind his own, so there was no way she could beat him. Although she had mighty powerhouses behind her, as long as her life wasn\u2019t in danger, those powerhouses wouldn\u2019t come out.With that said, wasn\u2019t it easy for him to bully her however he pleased right now?As for her revenge? As long as his cultivation was better than hers, she would never have that chance.The only matter left would be the hatred of digging out her Dao Bone\u2026Gu Changge had thought of a solution long ago, and if nothing worked, he still had the Devil Heart ready to take the blame for everything and anything.After that, he used the System to check Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s Fortune Value, and couldn\u2019t help but take a deep breath. Her Fortune value wasn\u2019t any less than Yue Mingkong\u2019s, no, it was even more broken!Ten thousand Points of Fortune Value!He had to accept that the Favored Children of Heaven in the Lower Really really amounted to nothing.\u201cHehe, Gu Changge, my \u2018dear\u2019 big brother, don\u2019t you feel ashamed of your words? If you still considered me your little sister, would you do what you did back then?\u201dGu Xian\u2019er never thought Gu Changge would show such an attitude towards her, but his words and indifferent expression only brought her discomfort. She clenched her jade-like teeth, and glared at Gu Changge with cold eyes.A beautiful smile bloomed on her gorgeous face that was previously downcast with hatred, and if an outsider who didn\u2019t know the grudge between them saw them, they would think she was on really good terms with Gu Changge.Right now, she wanted to punch him in the face and smash his head to the ground.The nearby cultivators went into shock when they saw the scene in front of them. They never thought that the little beauty in blue would turn out to have such a massive background \u2014 no one could have thought she would be Gu Changge\u2019s little sister!It\u2019s just that there seemed to be some grudge between the two of them?As for what happened back then? Just what happened back then?Jin Yu\u2019s complexion also changed. He never expected this backgroundless wench in blue to be someone from the Gu Family! After all, he already knew all the members of the Gu Family\u2019s younger generation, so he wondered where this girl in blue popped out from?Gu Xian\u2019er didn\u2019t say anymore, and only glared daggers at Gu Changge. After all, the matter would bring immense shame to their Gu Family, and she couldn\u2019t do that after how much care the other Elders had shown to her and her lineage.She didn\u2019t want to embarrass the Gu Family and make them lose face before outsiders.\u201cWe haven\u2019t met each other in such a long time, yet you treat me with such an attitude\u2026you really know how to make your big brother\u2019s heart ache!\u201dGu Changge said with a smirk, nowhere could one see any expression of regret on his face.Of course, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t regret it, it\u2019s just that he couldn\u2019t just give Gu Xian\u2019er an apology and be done with it. If he showed regret and apologized to her just like this, then Gu Xian\u2019er would definitely feel that he was a hypocrite who was plotting something shady.He didn\u2019t need to worsen the relationship between them.\u201cThen what kind of attitude should I treat you with? I can\u2019t wait to smash a fist into your face right now!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er hissed. She felt that Gu Changge had come all the way here just to rub salt in her wounds, and to tell her that all of her moves were in his view.He came here to posture in front of her so she would have nowhere to vent her rage.\u201cFine, smash it if you can.\u201dGu Changge chuckled, and showed an expression of not wanting to say anymore. At the same time, he turned towards Jin Yu, whose face showed a change, and said with a cold and indifferent expression, \u201cWhat kind of horse-crap are you? Only I can bully my little sister, if anyone else tries to harm her, then they can prepare themselves for death!\u201dAs soon as his words fell, he raised his hands and made a swatting movement. Brilliant runes intertwined and converged to form an extremely large and dazzling golden palm in the sky that fell towards him at great speed!\u201cGu Changge, you\u2026\u201dJin Yu\u2019s complexion changed, and his face paled as he couldn\u2019t believe Gu Changge\u2019s actions. They were at the foot of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, so Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t dare to kill him, right?The servants behind him also panicked and tried to move in desperation. Although they were in the False God Realm, they couldn\u2019t gather the power to resist Gu Changge\u2019s attack at the moment.Gu Changge\u2019s palm was like the hand of a god covering the world, covering them and everything around them without leaving any path of escape![Puff!]With a low sound, Jin Yu\u2019s servant exploded into a mist of blood. Jin Yu himself vomited blood, and his body perished. Still, his soul escaped with the help of a protective treasure that wrapped around his soul and brought it away.The surroundings turned dead silent. All the cultivators felt their scalps numb as chills went down their spines.They gulped and trembled in horror, feeling that something major would happen soon.\u201cGu Changge, don\u2019t think I will thank you for this!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er was also dumbfounded, but she reacted quickly, and spoke with a chilled expression.She didn\u2019t need Gu Changge to take action as she could resolve a mere Jin Yu by herself. Before, she was merely afraid of causing trouble and getting noticed by Gu Changge. Now that Gu Changge had already noticed her, she didn\u2019t need to keep a low profile.\u201cI don\u2019t need your thanks either,\u201d Gu Changge shook his head and continued, \u201cI just want you to know that I can bully you, but others can\u2019t! You can\u2019t let that happen.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All the cultivators in the surroundings stood in horror as chills went down their bodies. Needless to say, this was definitely a major matter!As the little brother of a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, Jin Yu had always been arrogant and domineering in front of others. No one had the guts to provoke him on normal days, but today?Gu Changge smashed his body into a meat patty, and only his soul could escape with the help of some Mystical treasure.Gu Changge had just returned to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and already caused such a sensation. They reckoned that Jin Yu\u2019s elder brother, Jin Zhou, wouldn\u2019t let this matter rest easily.The relationship between him and Gu Changge was already sour, so now that Gu Changge did this\u2026Besides that, someone with a keen eye suddenly noticed Gu Changge\u2019s cultivation base, and widened his eyes to make sure he wasn\u2019t mistaken, and then said with a trembling voice, \u201cHe killed a False God Realm powerhouse with a slap of his hand\u2026if I am not wrong, then the aura he released just now belonged to the Conferred King Realm! Gu Changge must have broken through to the Conferred King Realm, right?\u201d\u201cWhat?! How old is he? How is his cultivation speed so fast? I don\u2019t think I have heard of any other Young Supreme to have broken through to the Conferred King Realm!\u201dThe cultivator next to him was shocked.\u201cThat\u2019s to say that Gu Changge is the only Young Supreme who has broken through to the Conferred King Realm, right?\u201dOf course, there was a chance that some other Young Supremes had already broken through as well, and they had just suppressed the news. However, when it came to Gu Changge, any random action from him could shock the world already. Once this news went out, it would definitely cause a sensation in all eight directions![Boom!]Right then, a bunch of brilliant rays with powerful auras descended from the sky. They were the people of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s Law Enforcement team. There were seven or eight of them, but none of them dared to close in on the scene.They already knew what went down in this place, and it was because of this that they felt flustered and didn\u2019t want to get involved. The majesty and fairness of the Law Enforcement team would definitely be affected if they didn\u2019t go forward and investigate the matter, but Gu Changge was someone they couldn\u2019t afford to provoke.On the other hand was Jin Yu\u2019s brother, who was also a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and they couldn\u2019t provoke him either.They were stuck between a rock and a hard place.Gu Xian\u2019er, on the other hand, was left in a daze for a while before she finally recovered. She never thought that Gu Changge would say such shameless words like it was only natural. The indifferent expression on his face showed that dealing with her was no big deal.What did he mean by saying that only he could bully her?Why could others not bully her?Just what did he mean by those words? Was he treating her as his personal fluff toy that he could smash around however he pleased?She almost fainted with rage, and her face flushed red in anger. Her body trembled, and she yelled out towards Gu Changge, \u201cGu Changge, you are so shameless!\u201d\u201cI am shameless? Isn\u2019t protecting my little sister only right?\u201dGu Changge still responded with an uninterested tone, and glanced towards the direction where Jin Yu escaped. Still, he couldn\u2019t care less about a fly like him.Gu Xian\u2019er responded with a freezing tone, \u201cI don\u2019t need your protection! What are you plotting?\u201dShe didn\u2019t believe Gu Changge would treat her well for no reason \u2014 he was definitely plotting something! It\u2019s just that she couldn\u2019t figure out right away what he was plotting.\u201cWhat am I plotting?\u201dGu Changge chuckled and responded indifferently, \u201cWhat do you think I can plot against you? It might just be that I feel guilty and want to make up for my actions, no?\u201d\u201cOf course, it might also be that I just want to see you seethe in hatred without having any ability to do anything!\u201dGu Changge looked at her with a playful expression.\u201cFeeling guilty? People like you can\u2019t have such emotions! Just you wait and watch! If you don\u2019t kill me right now, then I will make sure to repay the pain you inflicted upon me over all these years!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er\u2019s rage soared as she heard his words. Sure enough, someone like Gu Changge couldn\u2019t turn over a new leaf.Over the years, she would recall the memory of the moment he dug out her Dao Bone every day. How could Gu Changge understand her pain?If an apology could solve grievances, why would the world be drowned in so much hatred right now?Even if Gu Changge apologized to her right now, she wouldn\u2019t accept his empty words! What use would those hypocritical words have for her?\u201cI would rather kill you right now, but\u2026\u201dThe smile on Gu Changge\u2019s face disappeared as he heard those words, and he sneered.Of course, that would be enough to scare her.As for whether he could really kill her? Even if he had the ability, the thought of the act wasn\u2019t realistic.After that, he paid no more attention to Gu Xian\u2019er, and went straight back to his carriage.Gu Xian\u2019er, on the other hand, paled as she heard Gu Changge\u2019s words. She didn\u2019t doubt that Gu Changge held murderous intentions towards her, after all, she also wanted to kill him.It\u2019s just that she wondered why Gu Changge didn\u2019t do it?He was unscrupulous even at the foot of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and no one dared to get in his way, so why would he need to show mercy to her?Or could it be that he was really only scaring her?\u201cGu Changge, sooner or later, you will regret not killing me right away!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er coldly spat towards Gu Changge, who was leaving in front of her, and clenched her fists. The brilliant runes she had condensed in her palms also disappeared, and her aura soon stabilized.After all, she still had to visit the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. If not for this coincidence, she would never want to come across Gu Changge so early. The might he radiated just from raising his hand gave her a sense of deep terror.Even a False God Realm cultivator was slapped to death by him!She didn\u2019t know just how high his strength had reached after not seeing him for so many years. The word\u00a0\u2018unfathomable\u2019\u00a0was no longer enough to describe him!\u201cMy Lady, are you alright?\u201d\u201cUncle Fu, I am fine; I am just a little angry. That Gu Changge didn\u2019t want to kill me, he just wanted to piss me off!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er gritted her teeth and responded to him. Her rage and murderous intent rose every time she mentioned Gu Changge\u2019s name.Uncle Fu couldn\u2019t help but show a bitter smile, \u201cMy Lady, it\u2019s a miracle that he didn\u2019t intend to take our lives. Don\u2019t forget that he has been looking for your whereabouts for years, and wants to kill you more than anyone else. Though, it\u2019s strange that he didn\u2019t go for the kill as soon as he saw you\u2026could it be because of the Elders back in the Family?\u201dGu Xian\u2019er shook her head, and said to him in response, \u201cEven if he tried to kill us, I am not afraid of him. Don\u2019t forget that my masters gave me a lot of treasures.\u201d\u201cThis old servant was merely wondering about what just happened. Gu Changge\u2019s behavior seems to have changed a lot from before, but his cruelty is all the same. When he killed those people, he didn\u2019t show a single ripple in his eyes, and trampled them to death like they were nothing more than ants.\u201dUncle Fu continued with a sigh, \u201cMy Lady, you must be careful when you cultivate in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace in the future. Gu Changge is a True Disciple of the Palace, so it won\u2019t be hard for him to deal with you.\u201dWhat happened in front of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s gates quickly caused a sensation, and spread to various parts of the world like wind.Gu Changge finally returned after half a year of disappearance!Countless cultivators were shocked and couldn\u2019t believe the news that followed.At the foot of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s gate, Jin Zhou\u2019s little brother had his body turned into meat paste, and the cause of his cruel fate was a girl dressed in blue who seemed to be a member of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.The girl in blue seemed to be Gu Changge\u2019s little sister, but there seemed to be some grudge between the two of them for some unknown reason.Jin Zhou\u2019s little brother was bullying the girl in blue, and happened to be found by Gu Changge who was returning to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. For this reason, Gu Changge directly slapped him into meat paste.The incident caused major earthquakes everywhere, and even spread to other regions.The moment when Gu Changge demonstrated his unparalleled might attracted the attention of many, and many recorded the events using [Imaging Stones]. This was what mattered the most to some people!In the battles of the Upper Realm, many stars shone brightly, and there were innumerable young geniuses. Many Realms and Worlds were drowning with favored children of heaven, and there was no shortage of talents in the younger generation.Everyone in the younger generation wanted to be in the limelight, gain fame in the Upper Realm, and shock the Universe.Still, killing a False God Realm powerhouse with a single palm was a record set only by Gu Changge, and it showed his terrifying might.This matter caused a massive sensation in every direction.[At the core of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.]Countless Immortal mountains floated in the sky, and majestic waterfalls descended from them. Mystical fog covered everything, and reflected the brilliant sunlight, giving the place the appearance of an Immortal\u2019s abode.Cultivators were rushing around atop one of the peaks, going in and out of buildings and palaces. This peak was called the Extreme Solitary Peak, and it was the place where Jin Zhou, one of the True Disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, resided.Brilliant mist shrouded everything inside a palace. A young man in golden robes sat in a lotus position, with a golden horn on his forehead. Spiritual Qi churned around him into a small whirlpool, and rushed into his body.A layer of golden light emerged from his body, and turned into small golden vortexes one after another. Inside each vortex sat a cross-legged, fairy-like phantom chanting divine scriptures.Endless brilliant runes appeared on the youth\u2019s body, and made for a strange vision. It was clear that he was cultivating some terrifying, ancient art.Behind the youth stood the faint shadow of a giant, golden beast that floated up and down. The beast\u2019s giant mouth was like a black hole that kept on swallowing the endless divine brilliance in the palace.The youth was none other than Jin Zhou, a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. He was a Young Supreme with might above his peers.Right at this moment, the void in front of him trembled, and a Primordial Spirit held inside a Mystical Treasure appeared out of thin air. The Spirit showed extreme resentment and rage, and said to Jin Zhou, \u201cElder Brother, you must avenge me! That Gu Changge is too much! I didn\u2019t even provoke him, yet he almost slapped me to death! He destroyed my body, and if it wasn\u2019t for this Mystical Treasure given by the, I would have died an early death!\u201dIt was none other than Jin Yu, who had escaped from Gu Changge back at the foot of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s gate.He was bitter, and wanted to smash Gu Changge to death by any means! He wouldn\u2019t be able to calm the hatred in his heart any other way, after all.The humiliation he suffered in front of everyone outside was worse than death itself!\u201cNow that you speak of it, wasn\u2019t it your own fault? Who asked you to mess with Gu Changge\u2019s little sister?\u201d\u201cI already know everything that went down outside.\u201dAs he said that, Jin Zhou\u2019s eyes turned cold, and he continued, \u201cStill, Gu Changge is indeed going too far! Even if he has the Ancient Immortal Gu Family behind him, our Ancient Immortal Golden Horn Family isn\u2019t one that can be bullied so easily!\u201d\u201cI will help you seek justice over this matter, but not right now. Gu Changge seems to have already broken through to the Conferred King Realm, while my ancient art is at the juncture of breakthrough. I won\u2019t be his opponent until I break through.\u201dJin Yu rejoiced as he heard his words, and said, \u201cThank you, Elder Brother! I will wait for the day you will avenge me Elder Brother! We must make Gu Changge regret what he did today!\u201dJin Zhou nodded and said nothing.In his heart, however, he turned extremely solemn and cautious. Gu Changge was his greatest enemy, and he couldn\u2019t underestimate him!Over the last period of time, he had come across various opportunities, and even condensed his Ancestral Phantom which brought his strength to another level. He had thought that he could finally avenge the serious injury he received at Gu Changge\u2019s hands back then, but who would have thought that Gu Changge\u2019s strength would soar at such a fast pace, and he would break through to the Conferred King Realm even before him!He, Jin Zhou, was only at the pinnacle of the Conferred Lord Realm right now. Still, he was completely confident in himself. By the time he broke through to the Conferred King Realm, he would definitely be able to thrash Gu Changge with all of his abilities and aces![1]\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[1]: Complete speculation, but\u2026 This guy got his a55 handed to him when Gu Changge was only in the Saint Realm and he was in the Conferred Lord Realm, so what makes him think that he can do something to him when they are in the same Realm? You can\u2019t tell me he went from Saint Realm to the pinnacle of the Conferred King Realm within six months, just like Gu Changge. He would need to also be a foaking transmigrator or some sh!z!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Halfway up the mountain were many Immortal Caves filled with a brilliant, hazy glow, Immortal mist, and clouds that floated around like smoke. The surroundings looked extremely gorgeous and colorful.This was the mountain where Gu Changge resided.This was one of the richest places in Spiritual Qi in the entire Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and the conditions for cultivation here were much better than the other peaks. Only the Elders and those unfathomable beings in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace could have a better residence and Immortal Cave.The Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was extremely vast, and held tens of thousands of islands and mountains dedicated to their disciples; this didn\u2019t even include the extremely mysterious region hidden in the depths of the Palace.There were countless ancient mountains and stone platforms scattered throughout the Palace\u2019s territory, and disciples would come across different opportunities in such places every now and then. The opportunities would help boost their cultivation bases and strength.[ROAR!!!]A carriage pulled by nine dragons appeared above the peak!Nowadays, many young geniuses visited the Supreme Peak almost every day. There were males and females \u2014 some Primordial Creatures, even \u2014 with powerful bloodlines and amazing combat prowess.\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cWelcome back, Master!\u201dAs soon as they saw the carriage pulled by the nine dragons, the young geniuses walked out together with awe and reverence in their eyes, and respectfully greeted Gu Changge.They were the followers the previous Gu Changge had subdued, and they could also be considered as somewhat famous geniuses in the outside world. The strongest among them had already broken through to the middle stage of the Conferred King Realm, and they were also Young Masters and Mistresses of various Ancient Families.Gu Changge walked out of the carriage with a flat expression, and said to them, \u201cGet up; did something happen while I was not here?\u201dAfter he left the area at the foot of the gate, he could no longer be bothered about Gu Xian\u2019er, and directly returned to his cultivation peak.As far as Gu Changge was concerned, Gu Xian\u2019er couldn\u2019t make any waves in front of him as she was right now. She was too weak and didn\u2019t have the ability to take revenge on him no matter how much she desired to!Right now, his main concern were the other True Disciples.The Supreme Peak was given its name by the current Master of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. The other peaks belonging to the other True Disciples were the same, and all of them had different meanings.\u201cReporting to Master, nothing major happened on the Supreme Peak in the last half a year, except for a few True Disciples and Elders sending people to inquire about your whereabouts.\u201dOne of them respectfully replied.\u201cWhat about the rest of the Sect?\u201dGu Changge nodded and asked again.\u201cI don\u2019t know what opportunity he received, but True Disciple Chu\u2019s cultivation broke through to the peak of the Conferred Lord Realm after he returned from the Tomb of Clouds. He\u2019s currently the strongest among the other True Disciples.\u201d\u201cSecondly, True Disciple Yin asked me to report to the Master that she had some important matters to discuss with you. She asked me to let her know when you return, so she could visit you again.\u201dThe man replied after hearing his question.The True Disciple Chu he talked about was called Chu Wuji, the Crown Prince of an Immortal Dynasty. He was extremely talented, and had shown extremely terrifying strength since he was young.As for True Disciple Yin? She was called Yin Mei, and was the Holy Maiden of the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family. The Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family was also an extremely ancient Immortal Family of the Upper Realm, and they held great might.A glint flashed through Gu Changge\u2019s eyes as he heard his words, and he responded to the disciple with a nod, \u201cI see.\u201dAfter that, he went straight back to the palace where he normally cultivated.\u201cMaster\u2019s strength is even more unfathomable now!\u201d\u201cI just got news that Master slapped Jin Yu\u2019s False God Realm servant to death outside the Palace\u2019s gate. It seems that Master has already broken through to the Conferred King Realm!\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of any other young genius breaking through to the Conferred King Realm!\u201dGu Changge\u2019s followers discussed with reverence after Gu Changge left, and felt even more awe for him in their hearts. Before, they still held some different thoughts after Gu Changge subdued them, but now, they were thoroughly convinced.The fact that the rest of the True Disciples had to unite just to contend with Gu Changge was proof that he was the one above all.\u2026\u2026The situation in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace wasn\u2019t much different from his expectations.All five main True Disciples had different behemoths of the Upper Realm standing behind them. Among them, the strongest were his Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and the Great Chu Immortal Dynasty, where Chu Wuji came from.The forces behind the other three weren\u2019t worse than their backgrounds either. It was precisely because of this that the Elders of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace couldn\u2019t intervene in their fight for the position of heir. After all, they would offend one force if they tried to please another.None of them were dumb enough to do a thankless job like that.\u2018It won\u2019t be long before the position of heir will be decided. But even if I become the heir, it won\u2019t be possible for me to completely grasp the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace in my hands. After all, there are still many Elders who are against me, especially the people who have tied themselves to the Great Elder\u2019s chariot. He\u2019s not known as the most terrifying existence in the Upper Realm for nothing\u2026\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but frown.According to the plan he and his father made, the first step to their dominance of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was for him to win the position of heir. But even after he won that position, there would be a long way to go before they reached their ultimate goal.Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace had changed its Master countless times, and it wasn\u2019t rare for people from other forces to stand at its top. The only one who never changed, though, was the Great Elder!No matter what kind of waves rose in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, he could easily suppress them.\u2018The Master is like flowing water, everchanging, while the Great Elder is like a stagnant pond, perpetually still.\u2019The Great Elder was the foundation of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and he was one of the reasons the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace could stand uncontended throughout the epochs. The other Elders weren\u2019t a bunch of wastes either.Many Heavenly Geniuses joined the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace in hopes of getting great opportunities and cultivation resources. They believed that they could learn unparalleled Mystical Abilities here, as well as those Celestial Scriptures hidden in their arsenal.At the same time, if they could get the support of the Elders from the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, they could fight for even higher status when they returned back to their respective Heritages.Gu Changge, on the other hand, intended from the beginning to swallow the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace in its entirety. If that alone wasn\u2019t enough, then the fact that he had a Devil Heart seemed to have also been noticed by some.He remembered well from the memories of his Original how many Elders of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace always treated him with wariness. Compared to the other True Disciples, Gu Changge\u2019s motives were simply too impure.It was true that the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace had multiple mighty inheritances, and that they had also cultivated countless behemoths who went on to become extremely famous in the Upper Realm, but Gu Changge wasn\u2019t in shortage of powerful inheritances. Not only did he have the Devil Arts, but he also had a System that could help his cultivation soar to unimaginable heights.Of course, it would be a different story if he came across some powerful Mystical Ability\u2019s inheritance. Although he could exchange for pretty much anything in the System\u2019s Shop, the stuff in there cost hard-earned Destiny Points.Why would Gu Changge bother wasting his wealth if there was a ready-made god-tier inheritance right in his face?After returning to his palace, Gu Changge forbade anyone from entering. At the same time, he called out his Attributes Panel.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Host: Gu ChanggeHalo: Destined Heavenly VillainWeapon(s): Eight Desolate Demon HalberdIdentity: True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace | Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu FamilyInnate Bloodline(s): Devil Heart | Dao BoneCultivation: Conferred King (Initial Stage)Mystical Abilities:Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex [8th Layer (30%)]Myriad Changes Demonic Physique (Talent)Innate God\u2019s Spirit Temple (Talent)Void Ability (Talent)Immortal-Devouring Demonic ArtInfinite Immortal Wisdom\u2026\u2026Destiny Points: 4000Fortune Value: 2100 (Dark)System Shop: OpenWarehouse:One-Third Fragment of a World Seed x3 (Merge)Fortune Plundering Card x3\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014His Fortune Value had automatically increased by a hundred points, while another five hundred points had come from his fiancee, Yue Mingkong.Gu Changge pondered for a while, and then exchanged one thousand points of his Fortune Value for Destiny Points. Immediately, his Destiny Points soared to 14000.He directly used 8000 Destiny Points to break through to the middle stage of the Conferred King Realm. Immediately, a strange-yet-refreshing aura washed through his limbs, and then gathered in his Sea of Consciousness.[Buzz!]His comprehension of the [Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex] also jumped to 60% at once. Many memories surged through his mind in the form of golden characters, but soon, everything fell silent.He was finally in the middle stage of the Conferred King Realm!\u2018The middle stage of the Conferred King Realm should be enough to pull wool over everyone\u2019s eyes in the outside world.\u2019Gu Changge thought to himself.He had known for a long time that he had two different cultivation systems. One came from the [Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex], and he could raise this cultivation through putting in Destiny Points, or just cultivating like normal people.This was the strength that he showed to the world.The second cultivation came from the [Immortal Devouring Demonic Art]. It was an evil method that could devour the very origin of mortals and immortals, and everything in-between that existed in Heaven and Earth.This was a heaven-shaking ability that couldn\u2019t be exposed at all costs. Once this is exposed, even the Ancient Immortal Gu Family won\u2019t be able to save him.As for why it was heaven-defying?Actually, Gu Changge wasn\u2019t very clear about this matter. He only knew that his strongest ace was the [Immortal Devouring Demonic Art]!It was something he couldn\u2019t expose unless he had run out of every other method!As for why Gu Changge wasn\u2019t clear about it? It was because the Original had sealed all memories regarding his greatest trump card. After all, if you wanted to trick others, you had to trick yourself first.After that, Gu Changge waved his hand, and a bunch of gray Formation Flags flew out of his sleeve. Countless brilliant runes intertwined together and sealed his palace\u2019s surroundings. It was a Concealment Formation he refined after paying a great price, and it\u2019s Concealment effect was unparalleled.[Buzz!]A chaotic fog spread around and soon enveloped the entire palace. With that, no one would be able to spy on him. As long as someone\u2019s Spiritual Sense came in his palace\u2019s direction, he would know immediately.Gu Changge sat in a lotus position, and the aura around him started to change at once. Strange pitch-black runes started to appear on his body, and they swam through his limbs like mysterious beings. It was as if chaos was coming into existence, and the Universe was about to be born.In the depths of his Sea of Consciousness, there seemed to be a seal set by a Heavenly Immortal God on top of his Primordial Spirit. But right then, the seal\u2019s lines turned pitch-black.[Crack!]With a final tug, the seal cracked. The seal on his memories was finally broken!Gu Changge\u2019s aura turned dark and sinister, and his Devil Intent overwhelmed his surroundings. It was as if he was a Devil God who had descended upon the world to bring forth its ruin. Fortunately, he had blocked all prying eyes using his Concealment Formation.One by one, dark Dao runes appeared in his hands and turned into a pitch-black [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] that floated above his heads, giving off innumerable rays of divine light.A terrifying and majestic power of suppression spread from his body, and his Primordial Spirit transformed as pitch-black brilliance filled his flesh!Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm!Late Stage!Pinnacle!Initial Stage of the False God Realm!Middle Stage!Late Stage!Pinnacle!True God Realm!Initial Stage!Middle Stage!Pinnacle!Half-Step Heavenly God Realm!\u00a0[-o- HOLY F!CK!]Right then, the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] felt Gu Changge\u2019s aura and trembled in excitement and joy.Gu Changge finally absorbed the sealed memories, and a strange expression appeared on his face.\u2018So this is my greatest trump card? The cultivation of Half-Step Heavenly God Realm? Sure enough, once this matter gets exposed, just my shocking cultivation speed would be enough to bring the entire world after my life! Anything else wouldn\u2019t even need to be exposed.\u2019\u2018Still, using sentient beings as nourishment that can be swallowed to increase my own strength\u2026this method sure seems more addictive than using Destiny Points.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the entire world will turn into my enemy.\u2019Gu Changge closed his eyes.No wonder this part of his memories was sealed. The heaven-defying methods of the [Immortal Devouring Demonic Art] were enough for him to break the balance of the world, and become enemies with everyone under Heaven!Right now, all of his peers were either in the Conferred Lord Realm, or just reaching Conferred King Realm, but his true cultivation was already at the Heavenly God Realm!What kind of concept was this? He couldn\u2019t even imagine the storm that this news would set off if it were to get out. The entire world might go insane and try to do something unimaginable!\u2018Wasn\u2019t I just a cannon-fodder villain? Why do I feel like I am the final boss?\u2019Soon, Gu Changge suppressed his aura of the [Immortal Devouring Demonic Art\u2019s] cultivation. As for the memories? After pondering for a while, he decided to not seal them. This was a matter of great importance, after all. Although he had to be cautious about it, he didn\u2019t think he needed to even keep himself in the dark.[Immortal Devouring Demonic Art] had a long history, and the world already saw its horror and heaven-defying methods once. For the outside world, the [Immortal Devouring Demonic Art] had already disappeared from existence.Now, even if he sealed the memories regarding his true cultivation base, it wouldn\u2019t bring him any benefit. After all, he was still using the [Immortal Devouring Demonic Art]\u2019s other techniques, so what use would sealing only some information have?In fact, there was no need to do something like that.After all, on the surface, he was the True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, with a cultivation in the Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm!Soon, Gu Changge\u2019s aura completely disappeared, and the surroundings returned to their former calm. One could no longer see anything abnormal about him. Unless he took the initiative to expose himself, no one would be able to discover his true cultivation base, so he wasn\u2019t worried about anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many disciples busied themselves in the discussion about the matter in the various Immortal peaks, and even many of the Elders felt that they should intervene before matters turned for the worse.Many speculated that Jin Zhou wouldn\u2019t give up, and would certainly avenge his little brother. After all, there was already a grudge between him and Gu Changge.What surprised everyone, though, was the fact that Jin Zhou went into closed-door training, and no news came from his side over this matter.As a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, every move made by Jin Zhou would attract the attention of countless people. The fact that he chose to avoid conflict by retreating into seclusion shocked many!As a Young Supreme, Jin Zhou had already lost badly at Gu Changge\u2019s hands when he suppressed his cultivation down to Gu Changge\u2019s level, so people guessed that he no longer had the guts to fight against Gu Changge now that his cultivation had overtaken Jin Zhou\u2019s.This matter caused even more waves in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace!All of them were Young Supremes, and they had reached their current heights after working hard. They were arrogant youths who wouldn\u2019t back down easily, so Jin Zhou\u2019s actions puzzled everyone. Even his flocks of followers felt uneasy in their hearts. Although they held confidence in Jin Zhou, Jin Zhou\u2019s act of refusing to take on such a challenge made certain thoughts rise in their hearts.Why did he go into closed-door training right now? Was he really afraid of Gu Changge?If this matter hadn\u2019t caused a deep enough earthquake, then the appearance of the Great Elder, who hadn\u2019t appeared for a long time, did. Not only did he appear without warning, but he also had a girl dressed in blue next to him.Many disciples immediately recognized the identity of the girl in blue \u2014 she was the girl because of whom Gu Changge almost slapped Jin Yu to death outside the gate of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. There were rumors that she was a member of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family; more than that, there were rumors that she was Gu Changge\u2019s little sister!It\u2019s just that the two seemed to have some sort of grudge between them.The sudden appearance of the Great Elder drew the attention of many disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and many even speculated that the Great Elder intended to accept the girl in blue as his disciple.One had to know that the Great Elder of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was a figure who stood at the peak of the Upper Realm, and he had an unfathomable cultivation base. The disciples he once accepted were now absolute hegemons over massive territory of the Upper Realm. Just a stomp of their foot could send waves throughout the Upper Realm!If the Great Elder truly intended to accept the girl in blue as his disciples, then there would be another True Disciple in the ranks of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. In terms of seniority, even many ancient behemoths wouldn\u2019t be able to compare to her.Another massive wave went through the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace after this matter came out. Before long, the girl in blue\u2019s identity was discovered by some cultivators:\u00a0\u2018Gu Xian\u2019er, 17 years old, extremely talented, and already at the Saint Realm.\u2019As for her origins, few could tell.However, some people heard the Great Elder praise Gu Xian\u2019er as the reincarnation of a supreme Immortal, Darling of the Dao, and the genius with an unparalleled foundation matched by none.Once these words came out, another wave went through the world.[1] One had to know that back when Gu Changge joined the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, the Great Elder had hardly said a few words of compliment.[1: modafungas dere be too many waves.]Could this be that the girl in blue had a talent even greater than Gu Changge\u2019s?The other person who attracted everyone\u2019s attention was Chu Wuji. Many saw him bring a bunch of his followers to visit the Great Elder\u2019s place of seclusion.[In the Heavenly Dao Ancient City outside the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.]Gu Changge tasted the wine in his cup with a smile, and a look of intrigue on his face. Right now, he was sitting inside a magnificent hall.In front of him stood a stunning woman with incomparable charm radiating from her every movement. Right now, she stood before him with a fearful and awe-inspiring expression.The woman\u2019s eyes appeared watery, as if they could swallow a person with a single gaze. Behind her, a bunch of snow-white foxtails moved up and down, appearing lustrous and snow-white.If some mighty figures saw her, they would exclaim in shock at the realization that she was a powerful descendant of the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family!Moreover, judging from the number of foxtails behind the woman, it was clear that she didn\u2019t hold a low status in the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family \u2014 her identity had to be extremely noble in the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family!Of course, if the disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace saw her here, they would be even more shocked. After all, the woman was none other than Yin Mei, one of the strongest among the True Disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.She was the Holy Maiden of the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family, an extremely mysterious and supreme existence among her peers.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201dRight then, Yin Mei called out to Gu Changge. Her gorgeous, snow-white face could be seen painted in fear and shame. One of her fluffy fox tail was in Gu Changge\u2019s hands, and his caressing made her almost unable to stand on her feet.\u201cThis is the cure for your Heart\u2019s Demon.\u201dGu Changge threw a weird-looking pill towards her while playing with the fluffy tail in his hand. As soon as Yin Mei got her hands on the pill, she swallowed it without hesitation, and then heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cThank you, Master.\u201dGu Changge nodded, and the expression on his face was such that she couldn\u2019t guess just what went through his mind.Right now, he was looking through his Original\u2019s memories.Yin Mei was the most mysterious of the five main True Disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, so much so that few could see her on normal days.A few years back, she ran into Gu Changge in an underground cave during an expedition inside a Secret Realm of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. Coincidentally, she encountered Gu Changge right when he was using his [Immortal Devouring Demonic Art] to devour the origin of a bunch of cultivators.She was shocked by the incomprehensible encounter!She never thought that Gu Changge, the brightest True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, would turn out to be an inheritor of such Devil Arts!At that time, the two ended up fighting. Yin Mei wasn\u2019t weak, and she had quite a few life-saving powers and means. Unless he used the [Immortal Devouring Demonic Art], Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat or kill her.For that reason, Gu Changge used his ultimate trump card, and brought out his true cultivation base to send Yin Mei down the road of despair.She wasn\u2019t willing to die, so she surrendered before Gu Changge. Obviously, Gu Changge didn\u2019t trust her, so he used a Heart\u2019s Demon together with a Demonic [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] to bind her.The Heart\u2019s Demon would attack her once every six months, so she would need an antidote from him to suppress it, or it would gnaw at her heart and devour it until it killed her.As for the [Great Dao Treasured Bottle]? It was naturally an extra layer of protection for him.Gu Changge didn\u2019t have any more Heart\u2019s Demons. They needed a lot of materials to refine, and the process to create them was also complicated beyond reason.After thinking about it for a while, Gu Changge decided to let Lin Qiuhan refine some for him. Of course, he would need to be the one to do the most important part of the process as it involved the use of his Devil Arts.\u201cHow is the collection going?\u201dGu Changge\u2019s mind finally came out of its trip down memory lane, and he asked with a mutter after letting go of the tail in his hand. The feeling of playing with the tail reminded him of the feeling of playing with a cat in his previous life.Of course, he was the only one who dared to treat someone from the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family\u2019s tail as a cat he could play with. If someone else touched their tail, they would definitely have their hands chopped off!\u201cReport to Master, I have collected a lot of geniuses with special physiques over the last half a year. I have already confirmed that there\u2019s nothing to worry about their identity or background. Right now, all of them are imprisoned in the dungeon.\u201d\u201cIn addition, I have also excavated and stolen the ancient corpses of powerhouses belonging to various Races. Their essence is still preserved, so they can also help Master!\u201dYin Mei replied after hearing his words, and didn\u2019t dare speak more than necessary. She understood Gu Changge\u2019s terror more than others, so she feared him even more than others.Moreover, she also understood well that the only reason Gu Changge kept her around was the large business industry of her Nine-Tailed Celestial Immortal Family that was spread throughout the Upper Realm.Not only could she help him get all sorts of news and information, but she could also help him gather cultivation resources.That\u2019s right, they were merely cultivation resources!All those geniuses with various physiques were nothing more than nourishment for Gu Changge that he absorbed using his [Immortal Devouring Demonic Art].There were innumerable creatures in the Upper Realm, so there was no lack of geniuses with special physiques and talents!Yin Mei contributed greatly to Gu Changge\u2019s current cultivation base of Half-Step Heavenly God Realm; she could be regarded as his closest confidant.Still, she didn\u2019t truly belong to him as she had merely surrendered out of fear to keep her own life.\u201cGood job.\u201dGu Changge praised her. Afterwards, he went down to the dungeon that was right below the hall they were sitting in.With all the resources he gathered for him over the past half a year, it won\u2019t take him long to break through to the Heavenly God Realm!\u2026\u2026[In the depths of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.]A lonely mountain that was thousands of feet tall floated in the Void. Immortal flowers and divine beasts were scattered all over the mountain, giving it a peaceful and aloof appearance.An old man with an amiable face and Immortal-like visage seemed to be fishing for something as he saw at the peak of the mountain. The old man\u2019s eyes showed a deep expression, as if they reflected the eternal Heaven itself.This old man was the Great Elder of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, an ancient behemoth who had lived through countless eras!Beside him stood a girl dressed in blue who watched him with a confused and curious expression. She could see clouds fly under them, and wondered what the Great Elder was trying to catch with his fishing line.\u201cGreat Elder, what are you trying to catch?\u201dGu Xian\u2019er finally couldn\u2019t hold herself back and asked.She had finally joined the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and the Great Elder indeed intended to take her as his disciple. It\u2019s just that she still needed to do something first.\u201cObviously, I am fishing for a person.\u201dThe Great responded cheerfully.Gu Xian\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but curl her lips at his response. She was already used to such riddle-like words from him.\u201cSince you came here, you must want to defeat your brother and get back what he took away from you, right?\u201dThe Great Elder suddenly asked. The look in his eyes turned even deeper, and it was as if he could see through anything and everything.\u201cI already have a new bone, so I don\u2019t need to take anything back.\u201dGu Xian\u2019er turned silent for a moment after hearing his words, and then said, \u201cBut I will certainly avenge myself, and get justice for all the pain he put me and everyone through.\u201d\u201cGood, you sure are ambitious even though you are so young! You deserve to be the disciple fancied by that old monster.\u201dThe Great Elder\u2019s smile showed no change, and he continued, \u201cGu Changge is too devilish; I felt his demonic nature on the day I met him for the first time! I am sure he wanted to use your Dao Bone to hide his own demonic nature. After all, even the Ancient Immortal Gu Family wouldn\u2019t want a devil in their midst.\u201d\u201cNo matter what happens, we can\u2019t make him the heir of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.\u201d\u201cXian\u2019er, I can accept you as my disciple, but you must first prove that you can surpass Gu Changge.\u201dGu Xian\u2019er\u2019s fists tightened as she heard his words, and she asked, \u201cGreat Elder, how can I prove myself?\u201d\u201cThe Heavenly Dao Road! You simply need to break Gu Changge\u2019s record. Can you do it?\u201dThe Great Elder asked with a smile.Gu Xian\u2019er was taken aback for a moment. She naturally knew about the Heavenly Dao Road of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. It was said to be the most mysterious and difficult roads that one could walk upon in the Upper Realm.For the Heavenly Geniuses who joined the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, just one more step on this Road could bring them great joy and pride. It represented their talent and future heights, and going far on the Heavenly Dao Road would be enough to make their name resound throughout the Upper Realm.\u201cI can do it!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er responded with a resolute expression.The Great Elder smiled at her determined response, and said, \u201cYou sure are confident! Do you know that Gu Changge overpowered all of his peers back then, and set a new record in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace that no one in the hundred thousand years before him could achieve?\u201d\u201cOh, someone got hooked!\u201dAs he said that, the Great Elder pulled back his fishing line. The clouds and mist in front of him surged, and a golden dragon-like figure with a dazzling body and a dignified aura burst through the clouds.\u201cThis one pays respects to the Great Elder!\u201dThe golden dragon-like figure landed on the ground and turned into a mighty and brave youth in a golden armor. He was Chu Wuji, a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a hearty smile on his face that gave those who gazed at him a positive feeling of trust.As soon as he appeared on the Great Elder\u2019s mountain, Chu Wuji noticed Gu Xian\u2019er, and a flash of surprise passed through his eyes. Still, his education and scheming mind didn\u2019t allow him to show any change in his expression.He had seen a lot of beauties in his life, but the one in front of him sure was on another level, so much so that he couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.\u201cThis one pays respects to the Great Elder!\u201dInstead, he bowed before the Great Elder.Not many in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace knew that Chu Wuji was actually the grand-disciple of the Great Elder. Chu Wuji\u2019s father, the current Emperor of the Great Chu Immortal Dynasty, was once a named disciple of the Great Elder. It\u2019s just that because of his status, he couldn\u2019t become a direct disciple.[1]Only a few knew of this fact.\u201cChu Wuji, you are here just in time.\u201dThe Great Elder responded to him with a nod. His attitude towards Chu Wuji wasn\u2019t all that bad.For the Great Elder, and other higher ups of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, Chu Wuji was obviously the better option. Regardless of talent, temperament, or cultivation, they couldn\u2019t find any flaws in Chu Wuji. What\u2019s more? He had an extremely calm and outstanding personality, and didn\u2019t have any devilish intentions like Gu Changge either.Among the True Disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, Chu Wuji was also the only one who could compete with Gu Changge.Many more Elders thought highly of him, and believed that Chu Wuji could be appointed as the heir, since his heart wasn\u2019t as sinister as Gu Changge\u2019s.Gu Xian\u2019er also looked at Chu Wuji. After all, he was a Young Supreme who was said to be someone who could compete with Gu Changge, so she couldn\u2019t help but feel curious about him.Chu Wuji had an imperial aura about him, and there was the ferociousness of dragons radiating from between his calm brows. His cultivation was unfathomable, and she couldn\u2019t clearly estimate his might.\u201cCould this Junior Sister be the lady who\u2019s getting famous through the rumors lately?\u201d\u201cJust one look, and I can tell the rumors surely aren\u2019t exaggerated. You truly have a fairy-like figure and outstanding temperament.\u201dChu Wuji looked back at Gu Xian\u2019er with a smile, and cupped his hands in greeting.\u201cI greet Senior Brother Wuji.\u201dGu Xian\u2019er responded with a nod. Although her expression showed incomparable calm, she was trying to figure out why Chu Wuji was showing her such friendliness. After all, she had only recently arrived in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and the Great Elder hadn\u2019t yet accepted her as his disciple.Her status in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was even worse than its ordinary disciples, so logically speaking, Chu Wuji wouldn\u2019t be this kind to her without a reason.Could he be like this because of Gu Changge? After all, there was the saying that:\u00a0\u2018an enemy\u2019s enemy is thy friend.\u2019\u201cI was wondering who to send with Gu Xian\u2019er to the Heavenly Dao Road\u2026Chu Wuji, you can take her along since you are already here.\u201dThe Great Elder calmly said.\u201cHeavenly Dao Road?\u201d\u201cIt seems that Junior Sister is an ambitious one, but I must warn you about the dangers of the Heavenly Dao Road. If you try to overreach on the Road, you will suffer unimaginable damage to your Dao Heart, and even your Realm might never increase after that.\u201d\u201cJunior Sister, do you still want to go even after knowing this?\u201dChu Wuji was stunned. He had actually come here for Gu Xian\u2019er after getting some news about her. To be precise, he found out that Gu Xian\u2019er held the evidence that could make the Ancient Immortal Gu Family lose all face in front of the Upper Realm.Once the matter came out, the Ancient Immortal Gu Family would turn into a joke, and every Lu, Shu, and Du in the Upper Realm would laugh at them!An ancestor of his Great Chu Immortal Dynasty had suffered serious injuries at the hands of someone from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, so he obviously didn\u2019t have any good feelings towards the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and longed to see them turn into a joke.Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t treat Gu Xian\u2019er without courtesy in front of the Great Elder.The Great Elder glanced at him, and shook his head without saying anything.Gu Xian\u2019er, on the other hand, still showed a calm expression, and said, \u201cI am sure about my decision, so Senior Brother Wuji doesn\u2019t need to worry about me!\u201dChu Wuji\u2019s hearty and carefree smile didn\u2019t change as he heard Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s words, but he sneered inside his heart; he also wanted to see just how far this overconfident\u00a0\u2018reincarnation of a true immortal\u2019\u00a0could go?\u201cAlright, then Senior Brother will wait and see.\u201dChu Wuji said that and then turned into a brilliant ray of light as he led Gu Xian\u2019er towards the direction of the Heavenly Dao Road.Gu Xian\u2019er followed suit without hesitation.At the same time, she couldn\u2019t help but feel as if Chu Wuji was plotting something \u2014 this feeling came from her instincts, and her instincts hadn\u2019t betrayed her over the years even once.\u201cMaster!\u201dSoon, a bunch of Chu Wuji\u2019s followers appeared in front of them, and showed surprise as they saw Gu Xian\u2019er.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the Heavenly Dao Road!\u201dChu Wuji commanded with an authoritative tone.At the same time, he didn\u2019t forget to turn around to take a look at Gu Xian\u2019er. With a sigh, and face full of regret, he said, \u201cJunior Sister, I actually heard some information about your affairs, and I must say that Gu Changge is indeed cruel. His actions were earth-shattering, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel shocked and chilled to my feet! Something like that could only be done by a beast, not a brother\u2026\u201dGu Xian\u2019er frowned as she listened to his words, but didn\u2019t say anything in response. Although she knew that he was bad mouthing Gu Changge, she couldn\u2019t help but feel uncomfortable in her heart.Gu Changge was an evil bastard, indeed, but he wasn\u2019t as scummy as this kind of villain who sowed hatred behind someone\u2019s back. Although Gu Changge\u2019s methods were cruel and ruthless, he was still better than him. What\u2019s more? The matter was between her and Gu Changge, so she didn\u2019t want others to stick their nose inside her business.\u201cSenior Brother Wuji, you should just lead the way; I didn\u2019t expect a True Disciple like you to talk behind someone\u2019s backs\u2026\u201dGu Xian\u2019er cut him off with a calm response. The hidden meaning behind her words was as simple as:\u00a0\u2018why are you harping nonsense about him in front of me? Go to him if you have the guts!\u2019She could tell that this so-called True Disciple Chu was trying to win her over to his camp, so he could deal with Gu Changge.Chu Wuji\u2019s expression uglified, but recovered just as fast, after he heard her words. After all, he was a person who could stay calm in the face of joy, anger, and other such emotions.Still, Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s words made him feel a little enraged and cold. Was she mocking him for not having the guts to say all that to Gu Changge\u2019s face?A mere wench still wet behind the ears, who had barely reached the Saint Realm, actually dared say that to his face?It seemed that the Great Elder boosted her confidence.If he wasn\u2019t afraid of the Great Elder, Chu Wuji would truly help her understand who the young overlord of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was!Still, he couldn\u2019t help but feel somewhat puzzled. The news he received said that the hatred between Gu Changge and Gu Xian\u2019er was as deep as the endless ocean, so he couldn\u2019t understand why she would speak up for Gu Changge?\u2026\u2026Soon, a piece of news shocked everyone in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace:\u00a0\u2018the girl in blue who was standing next to the Great Elder that day was going to walk down the Heavenly Dao Road, in order to break Gu Changge\u2019s record!\u2019This news was naturally spread around by Chu Wuji, and it caused a massive sensation in all directions, so much so that even the other True Disciples were alarmed and wanted to take a look.The girl in blue had a mysterious identity, and it was said that she was a member of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. If that wasn\u2019t enough, then there was also the fact that the Great Elder wanted to take her in as his disciple, and held great expectations for her.Let alone the disciples, even many Elders couldn\u2019t suppress their curiosity and came over to have a look.In the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, the Heavenly Dao Road was like a springboard for carps to jump over the dragon gate. After all, it could have great effects on the talent of the Heavenly Geniuses, even though talent was something set from birth and considered almost unchangeable.Colorful clouds, brilliant rays of lights, and rainbows filled the sky as people and Mystical Items flew around. Many disciples went to the area where the Heavenly Dao Road was located, and one could see innumerable silhouettes of people on the various mountains in the surroundings. For a time, the entire place turned lively.Many people also noticed the appearance of some Elders and their disciples.\u201cThe Heavenly Dao Road\u2019s previous record was broken after a hundred thousand years by True Disciple Gu that year, and no one has been able to surpass him yet.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a Young Supreme who\u2019s said to be the reincarnation of an Immortal, after all. I heard that his cultivation broke through to the Conferred King Realm already!\u201d\u201cThat kind of cultivation speed is simply unimaginable. I haven\u2019t heard of any of our peers breaking through to the Conferred King Realm yet! Even True Disciple Chu seems to be stuck at that final step.\u201d\u201cIs it so easy to break the record set by True Disciple Gu? What a joke! That girl in blue is merely dreaming.\u201dThe people in the surroundings discussed the matter with great zeal.The Heavenly Dao Road was a snow-white, jade stairway surrounded by Immortal mist. It had an incomparably mysterious appearance, and each of its steps had Dao Patterns and Dao Intent permeating all over them. As the Heavenly Geniuses walked up the steps, they would come across different visions.The Heavenly Dao Road was said to lead all the way to Heaven, and no one could tell how many steps it had. Every hundred thousand years, the Heavenly Dao Road would manifest here, and countless Young Geniuses would come here to scale its steps.In other words, the record would be refreshed every hundred thousand years.Every hundred thousand years would be the era of the same Heavenly Geniuses, so all of them were naturally unwilling to be left behind by their peers. All of them wanted to leave their footprints on the Heavenly Dao Road to gain fame and fortune in the world.The Territory of True Immortals \u2014 those words weren\u2019t a joke.[2][2: I presume this is referring to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace since they are related to Immortals and the stairs in their backyard even lead all the way up to Heaven. Imagine a Heavenly Genius who finally scales the stairs and then finds himself inside a dome-shaped training camp (read: pigsty) for Geniuses.]Right now, many disciples and cultivators were gathered near the foot of the Heavenly Dao Road to watch the excitement.Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s face showed an incomparable calm as her slender body moved forward.\u201cJunior Sister, make sure you don\u2019t push yourself beyond your ability; the pressure on the Heavenly Dao Road is extremely high.\u201dChu Wuji advised her with a kind expression.Gu Xian\u2019er showed no change in her expression as she glanced at him without uttering a response.The fact that almost all of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace knew about this matter in such a short time could only mean that Chu Wuji made it public. As for why? He definitely wanted to watch her make a fool of herself in front of the world;\u00a0 he couldn\u2019t hide his true intentions from her keen mind.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for a few days, and you already have a suitor, Xian\u2019er? How about Big Brother test him to see if he\u2019s even worthy?\u201dRight then, an obnoxious chuckle sounded from somewhere, and the calm on Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s face disappeared. She turned her head, and looked in the direction of the voice with freezing eyes.Gu Changge slowly walked towards her; today, he was dressed in snow-white clothes untouched by the dust of his surroundings. Behind him walked a large group of powerful followers. The expressions of the nearby disciples fell, and they couldn\u2019t help but retreat one by one as they saw his entourage.After he was done with his\u00a0\u2018cultivation\u2019\u00a0in the Heavenly Dao Ancient City, he headed back to his Supreme Peak. But just when he reached the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s territory, he came across Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s silhouette as she flew towards the Heavenly Dao Road\u2019s direction.Gu Changge felt curious about what she was up to, and decided to come here.\u201cHoh! Is this the little sister who is going to be accepted as the Great Elder\u2019s disciple? She sure is a beauty in the making, and will definitely turn out to be a gorgeous seductress when she grows up, no?\u201dAnother chuckle sounded from a different direction as a stunning woman with a veil appeared. Behind her were a few fox tails respectfully held in the embrace of her maids, so as to prevent them from getting dirty by touching the ground.She was the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s female True Disciple, Yin Mei!In front of outsiders, she acted as if she had nothing to do with Gu Changge. After Gu Changge left the Heavenly Dao Ancient City, she had also headed back to her personal Peak.As the cultivation \u2018resources\u2019\u00a0she prepared in the last six months were particularly sufficient, and Gu Changge also seemed to have developed some interest in her fox tails, he bestowed upon her a few more antidotes, so Yin Mei was in an incomparably good mood.[Hiss!]\u201cTrue Disciple Gu\u2019s appearance was already shocking enough, yet even the mysterious True Disciple Yin is here! I truly never expected something like this.\u201d\u201cIt seems we will have a great show to watch today!\u201dEveryone in the surroundings was shocked as they watched the scene in front of them. They never expected so many True Disciples to gather in a single place at this time.What\u2019s more? Even Gu Changge appeared today!On normal days, he was like a hidden dragon whose tail was already hard enough to see.[3][3: just a random idiom that says it\u2019s very hard to see someone.]\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[1]:\u00a0 there are many kinds of disciples one can have, but I will explain the direct and named ones only. Named disciples are like students who can have multiple teachers and don\u2019t get the true inheritance/teachings of the teacher.Direct disciples are those who are dedicated to only one Master, and get the true inheritance/teachings of the Master. Although they can learn from others, they can\u2019t take anyone else as their Master unless someone better than their Master comes around and their Master agrees to let them worship that person as their Master as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For some reason, she couldn\u2019t help but become enraged every time she saw Gu Changge, and couldn\u2019t bring herself to speak with a good tone and a good expression.She would be calm in front of others, but whenever Gu Changge appeared in front of her, her rage would soar, and she would show emotions like anger and such.\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question yet.\u201dGu Changge said with a chuckle, and ignored Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s eyes that said that she wanted to swallow him whole in a single bite.Chu Wuji, on the other hand, also felt uncomfortable when he heard Gu Changge\u2019s remark.What did Gu Changge mean by calling him Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s suitor?As the brightest prince of the Great Chu Immortal Dynasty, did he still need to pursue girls? Just a word from him would be enough to bring all kinds of favored heavenly daughters to warm his bed.Although he knew that Gu Changge was merely ridiculing him, he couldn\u2019t help but feel unhappy. His complexion fell, and he felt even worse when he realized that Gu Changge completely ignored his existence.\u201cSenior Brother Chu Wuji was only leading me to the Heavenly Dao Road; he isn\u2019t my suitor!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er replied with a frown, and wondered just what Gu Changge was up to now.Gu Changge pretended to be stunned by her words, and then said with a sigh, \u201cSo that\u2019s the case\u2026Elder Brother felt that he had to help guard you, lest any random mutt from the streets rush up to bother you.\u201dGu Xian\u2019er snorted when she heard those words, and didn\u2019t believe Gu Changge\u2019s nonsense.Contrary to what others might think, Gu Changge was certainly not the kind of person he pretended to be in front of outsiders.Would someone like Gu Changge really stick up for her?She didn\u2019t believe he would.\u201cJunior Sister Xian\u2019er is about to climb the Heavenly Dao Road now! Gu Changge, do you dare stop her? This is the Great Elder\u2019s arrangement.\u201dChu Wuji\u2019s face sank when he heard Gu Changge referring to him as a random mutt from the streets, and he decided to use the Great Elder\u2019s name to scare him.No matter the differences between them before, Gu Changge had never used such words to humiliate him in public.\u201cWhat about the Great Elder? Do you think he will interfere when the juniors are bickering?\u201dGu Changge couldn\u2019t care less about his implicit threat, and glanced at him without much focus.\u201cAlso, I am talking to my little sister, so who the heck are you to interfere?\u201dChu Wuji\u2019s face turned livid, and he could hardly hold back his rage after he heard those words. His complexion changed from blue to white and vice-versa as he glared at his adversary.Gu Changge had repeatedly humiliated and provoked him. No matter how kind or amiable he might have been, he was unable to take his provocation anymore.What\u2019s more? They were out in the public!If he swallowed these insults without retaliation, how would he be able to mingle around in the Upper Realm in the future? He would have no face to face anyone!He was also a Young Supreme, so how could he accept such humiliation?\u201cGu Changge, don\u2019t be too overbearing!\u201dChu Wuji\u2019s expression was gloomy that his livid face appeared to be on the verge of an explosion.\u201cSo what if I am overbearing?\u201dGu Changge responded with an indifferent tone.He had wanted to deal with this Chu Wuji for a while now, but hadn\u2019t found a good opportunity. Now that he had provoked him this much, he didn\u2019t believe that Chu Wuji would be able to sit still.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dChu Wuji\u2019s expression showed extreme rage, and it was clear that he was on the verge of erupting. No matter how calm and steady he might be on peaceful days, there was no way he could bear such an insult at this time.This scene caused an uproar in the surroundings.Before they could watch Gu Xian\u2019er ascend the Heavenly Dao Road, they got to see the conflict between Gu Changge and another True Disciple.Excitement surged through the hearts of many onlookers! After all, it wasn\u2019t easy to see a battle between True Disciples!No one could have thought that Gu Changge would be this arrogant! He didn\u2019t even give face to Chu Wuji, who was also a True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.Everyone knew that Gu Changge was mighty, but the other True Disciples weren\u2019t cannon fodder either. Since they were able to become True Disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, then they obviously had their own strengths and talents.All of them were Young Supremes, and none of them were weak cabbage!Not just the disciples, but even the Elders felt excitement at this moment.It was normal for peers to fight, but it was rare to see a fight like this. Directly provoking someone in public, and egging them for a fight wasn\u2019t something they got to see every day.If the already present audience wasn\u2019t enough, then two more True Disciples \u2014 Tian Yang and Zhong Tianyuan \u2014 also appeared on a nearby mountain. The two were shrouded in hazy brilliance, and watched the scene in front of them with solemn expressions.\u201cChu Wuji\u2019s strength is unfathomable. The two of us might not be his opponents by ourselves, but Gu Changge is definitely stronger than him\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s little chance for Chu Wuji to win this exchange, but if he backs down right now, his Dao Heart might end up in a damaged state.\u201d\u201cDefeat in a battle is a minor matter; you can still stand back up and fight if you are defeated, but once your Dao Heart is damaged, you will have no chance to make a comeback in the future!\u201dThe two spoke among themselves, and their expressions turned even more solemn.A Young Supreme ought to firmly believe that they were invincible among their peers, and could sweep through all without a hitch. If they retreated in face of a challenge, what would they even be fighting for?The two were sure that this battle couldn\u2019t be avoided.Unless some accident happened, of course.\u201cI want to see just how strong you have grown, for you to humiliate me like this!\u201dChu Wuji yelled and then attacked Gu Changge. All the onlookers in the surrounding area were shocked and backed away in haste.Only Yin Mei felt that Chu Wuji was digging his grave with his own hands. Gu Changge\u2019s strength was far from what he could imagine. Even the strength he showed in the public was something that the other Young Supremes couldn\u2019t ever hope to match.Gu Xian\u2019er also paid great attention to their exchange as she also wanted to know just how much Gu Changge\u2019s strength had grown over the years.\u201cRoyal Dragon Palm! It\u2019s the Great Chu Immortal Dynasty\u2019s famous Royal Dragon Palm!\u201dSomeone exclaimed as they recognized Chu Wuji\u2019s move at first glance.[Boom!]Chu Wuji used a major move from the get-go. Brilliant runes intertwined together, and formed a dragon that rushed to grab Gu Changge. The dragon had a terrifying aura, and it moved at a frightening speed.It was so terrible that even disciples in the distance felt their skin crack.\u201cIt\u2019s so scary! Is this the might of a Young Supreme?\u201d\u201cAn ordinary False God Realm cultivator will never be a match for True Disciple Chu! You must know that he\u2019s only at the peak of the Conferred Lord Realm, and there\u2019s still an entire major Realm before he can reach the False God Realm!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s too strong! This is the gap between True Disciples and us!\u201dChu Wuji\u2019s mighty palm shocked many in the surroundings.Gu Changge slapping Jin Yu\u2019s False God Realm servant to blood mist was already shocking enough, and now, even Chu Wuji\u2019s palm held a power that could easily obliterate a False God Realm cultivator!Sure enough, it wasn\u2019t hard for Young Supremes to fight beyond their Realms!\u201cWere you prancing around because of this? Who gave you this confidence?\u201dGu Changge showed no change in his expression as he faced Chu Wuji\u2019s palm, and spoke with a carefree expression. At the same time, he responded with a palm of his own made up of golden runes.Divine, golden light permeated the surroundings, and the palm fell down![Boom!]The two great palms collided with each other, and burst into an explosion of Mystical Power that caused an astonishing sensation in all directions!It was as if a meteorite fell apart above them and collided with the ground. The nearby mountains trembled, the earth cracked, and space splintered apart.[Puff!]Chu Wuji flew out with blood splattering around. His head appeared to be caved in, and his disheveled hair flew in the air. Just the aftermath of the attacks gave him grave injuries!Disbelief covered his face, and he said with astonishment, \u201cMiddle Stage of the Conferred King Realm?!\u201dIt was difficult to decide a winner when two Young Supremes in the same realm fought against each other, but not so much when one\u2019s cultivation overpowered the other\u2019s by a great margin. Especially, when the stronger one was someone like Gu Changge!Back when Gu Changge was only in the Early Stages of the Saint Realm, he had severely injured the Young Supreme, Jin Zhou, who had been in the Middle Stage of the Saint Realm!And now? No one expected Gu Changge to have already broken through to the Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm!The onlookers couldn\u2019t help but take in a deep breath.He was too powerful!They never thought that a casual blow from Gu Changge would hold such cataclysmic might!He was simply invincible!\u201cHe\u2019s worthy to be known as the Reincarnation of an Immortal! True Disciple Chu probably wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to win even if the two were in the same Realm\u2026\u201d\u201cI never expected Gu Changge to break through to the Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm so fast!\u201dTian Yang and Zhong Tianyuan, the other two Young Supremes, couldn\u2019t help but stare at each other in disbelief.\u2018How is he so strong?\u2019Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s expression also turned solemn. She was already far behind him in cultivation, and couldn\u2019t estimate just how long it would take her to reach Gu Changge\u2019s heights even if she rushed her cultivation.\u201cSo what if you are in the Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm?\u201dRight then, Chu Wuji shouted towards Gu Changge. At the same time, bright, golden light radiated from his person, and a layer of dragon scales appeared on his skin.This was his talent of transforming into a dragon, and it was his trump card which could boost his cultivation base to a completely new height!Before today, he had never used this ability in front of outsiders. But today, Chu Wuji could no longer go without it. He only knew one thing, and that was to defeat Gu Changge and wash away the humiliation he received from him![Hu! Hu! Hu!]A domineering and long-beyond-measure dragon appeared behind him. It was a true dragon with immortal energy lingering around it. With a single gulp, it could swallow all the clouds between Heaven and Earth, and it\u2019s golden scales reflected bright, golden light!The huge dragon appeared incomparably lifelike as it rushed towards Gu Changge. An earth-shattering tremor shook the surroundings as it tried to obliterate the mountains and dry the rivers, and a destructive force that could kill all in its path headed towards Gu Changge!All the cultivators in the surroundings were even more horrified. At the same time, they couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the might of the Young Supremes, and their endless means. Had they not seen Chu Wuji use this ability with their own eyes, they would have never thought that he held such a trump card in his arsenal.\u201cWhat about the Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm, you ask? It\u2019s more than enough to stomp your Dao Heart.\u201dGu Changge laughed as he watched Chu Wuji\u2019s trump card. At the same time, an immeasurable light burst behind him, and a vague figure made of the Great Dao\u2019s law appeared. The figure appeared magnificent, and seemed to contain all the secrets of Heaven and Earth.\u2018Dao Incarnate?!\u2019Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s expression changed. Her face paled, and she felt a familiar aura from the Dao Incarnate behind Gu Changge. She immediately recognized it as the Mystical Ability that belonged to her Dao Bone.[Boom!]Right then, Gu Changge slapped out, and the Dao Incarnate behind him followed suit. The fluctuations of energy it released made the disciples, and even the Elders, show a change in their expressions.The palm collided with the dragon!It was as if a star exploded right above them![BOOM!!!]A massive wave erupted and washed over the surroundings. All the mountains quaked under the disastrous might released by the collision of their attacks. All the disciples trembled, and felt their hearts and souls palpitate in response to the incoming earthquake.They felt as if everything around them was about to perish!Finally, the brilliance receded, and they watched the palm of Gu Changge\u2019s Dao Incarnate press down on the dragon that Chu Wuji brought out. The harder Gu Changge pressed down on the dragon, the more blood Chu Wuji spewed \u2014 his body neared the verge of collapse as he felt the pressure suppress him.The palm\u2019s descent didn\u2019t stop![Puff!]Chu Wuji spewed blood, and the dragon he conjured finally exploded. At the same time, half of Chu Wuji\u2019s body burst apart. Horror and disbelief painted his face \u2014 he had already used his strongest trump card, yet Gu Changge was still able to stomp him down with ease!\u201cSo, who the heck are you?\u201dGu Changge came out on top. Without a change in his expression, he disappeared from his spot and appeared next to Chu Wuji. And then, he directly stepped over his head while repeating his sentence once more.VILFIC, the SLAVE: Chapters in the backlog: 9 (5th + 6th + 7th of February) FML | Backlog will be made up next week.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRemember That Sentence; Shocking Everyone![Puff!]Chu Wuji\u2019s face turned purple as Gu Changge stepped on his head, and he felt incomparable hatred and humiliation.Alas! He couldn\u2019t do anything.His strongest move had already failed, and it was clear that he wasn\u2019t Gu Changge\u2019s opponent. Just a casual attack from Gu Changge required him to go all out just to resist!Today, Chu Wuji finally realized just how terrifying and powerful Gu Changge was. At the same time, he felt extreme grief and unwillingness.Gu Changge repeating his sentence and asking him\u00a0\u2018what the heck he was\u2019\u00a0brought him even more shame. His contemptuous and indifferent attitude made him extremely uncomfortable!The surrounding mountains were quiet for a while, but then they exploded. The battle ended as quickly as it started. Many had thought that even if Chu Wuji, the prince of the Great Chu Immortal Dynasty, lost to Gu Changge, he would still be able to contend against him for a while.They never expected him to have no ability to resist!That\u2019s right! Chu Wuji was unable to resist Gu Changge\u2019s atacks. From the beginning to the end, he was one-sidedly stomped. Even when he used his greatest trump card, a casual move from Gu Changge was enough to stomp him to the ground.The onlookers shuddered at the outcome of their exchange. A Young Supreme like Chu Wuji was already like this when he faced against Gu Changge, so what would become of them if they went against him?Since one of them already got his face planted on the ground, then they would have an even worse end \u2014 all of them were like ants in front of him!\u201cHe deserves to be the one who broke the Heavenly Dao Road\u2019s record that hadn\u2019t been touched in a hundred thousand years! That strength is too terrifying! A True Disciple was crushed just like that; I feel that even if True Disciple Chu broke through to the Conferred King Realm right now, he still wouldn\u2019t be his match. No one can be True Disciple Gu\u2019s opponent now!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I think the same! What\u2019s more? True Disciple Gu was completely carefree throughout the exchange, and we haven\u2019t seen him use any of his trump cards yet.\u201dYin Mei, the Holy Maiden of the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family, showed a disdainful smile under her veil as she listened to the conversations of the nearby disciples.Gu Changge\u2019s Trump Cards?She reckoned that anyone who had seen Gu Changge\u2019s trump cards was already dead! She was probably the only one who got to keep her life.Gu Changge was definitely the most dangerous man she had seen in her life \u2014 be it in terms of temperament, scheming, and means.\u201cGu Changge\u2019s might is uncontestable! No wonder Jin Zhou chose to cultivate in seclusion instead of taking revenge \u2014 he must have expected this outcome already!\u201d\u201cWe would better take a U-turn when we see Gu Changge in the future, unless our cultivation can somehow surpass his!\u201dTian Yang and Zhong Tianyuan looked at each other with shock and disbelief. Afterwards, they chose to leave the crowd in silence.Sure, they were Young Supremes, but that didn\u2019t mean they lacked a brain. Gu Changge was already in the Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm, so how were they going to compete with him?Fight beyond their Realm? What a joke!Many of the disciples and Elders noticed their presence, and only shook their heads as they watched them leave. Now, even if the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace didn\u2019t select him as their heir, everyone in the Palace would still need to take a detour if they came across Gu Changge.Today\u2019s battle had already established Gu Changge\u2019s supremacy above them all!\u201cXian\u2019er, aren\u2019t you happy to see your Elder Brother stomp this trash for you?\u201dGu Changge looked at Gu Xian\u2019er, who was still in a daze, and asked with a chuckle. At the same time, he pressed down his foot even harder, and then kicked Chu Wuji in the chest. Chu Wuji spewed another mouthful of blood, and then fainted with a groan.Alas! Gu Changge couldn\u2019t kill him.Chu Wuji was the most brilliant prince of the Great Chu Immortal Dynasty, so there would definitely be a bunch of people in hiding who would interfere if he went too far. What\u2019s more? Gu Changge didn\u2019t want to provoke an unnecessary war with the Great Chu Immortal Dynasty over a mere Chu Wuji.All he did today was to tell the Elders of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace that only he, Gu Changge, was qualified to be the heir of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace! No one could take that position from him.Even if no one mentioned this matter, he would still make sure to drill this into their heads!How could Gu Changge not know how guarded the Elders, and even the Great Elder, were towards him? He knew all of this, of course. It\u2019s just that the Original couldn\u2019t care less. He had anticipated this situation long before he even joined the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.Gu Xian\u2019er was, of course, happy to watch Gu Changge teach that despicable Chu Wuji a lesson; it\u2019s just that she would never admit something like that. Her good mood disappeared, and her face showed a hostile expression, as she heard Gu Changge\u2019s obnoxious chuckle.\u201cI don\u2019t need you to interfere in my business!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er replied without any politeness. To be precise, she had no reason to be polite before Gu Changge. She was already treating him quite well by controlling herself from smashing a fist into his face.She could always stay calm when in front of others, but whenever Gu Changge appeared before her, she would want to act impulsively. She had to try her best to suppress her rage and other emotions!\u201cHave you forgotten what Elder Brother told you before?\u201dGu Changge muttered to her with a look of deep disappointment. At the same time, he ignored Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s face full of murderous intentions towards him.When it came to shamelessness, no one could outdo him!\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dGu Xian\u2019er asked with a cold tone.\u201cI can bully you, but others can\u2019t!\u201dGu Changge\u2019s face showed an expression of intrigue as he continued, \u201cThis Chu Wuji definitely wanted to watch you make a fool of yourself on the Heavenly Dao Road. The Great Elder must want you to break my record before accepting you as his disciple, right?\u201d\u201cThis Chu Wuji\u2019s schemes are too deep; not only did he want to watch you make a fool of yourself, but he even publicized the matter and invited everyone in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace to this place.\u201d\u201cHis heart is damned!\u201d\u201cHow can someone like him bully this Gu Changge\u2019s little sister? If someone is going to bully you, then that person can only be me! What kind of dog crap is he?\u201dGu Changge\u2019s expression turned cold as he said these words. At the same time, Gu Xian\u2019er felt the surrounding temperature drop at a fast pace, and she couldn\u2019t help but shiver slightly in response.[Crack!]Right then, the sound of cracking bones sounded in the surroundings. Her beautiful eyes widened in response to what she saw in front of her. Gu Changge casually stepped on the unconscious Chu Wuji\u2019s hands, and shattered the bones in his hands. Chu Wuji let out a painful scream in response to the pain, but Gu Changge acted as if he was stepping on nothing more than an ant.\u201cXian\u2019er, make sure you don\u2019t forget that sentence in the future!\u201dGu Changge looked at her dazed face, and said with a smile, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to climb the Heavenly Dao Road? Your Elder Brother is looking forward to your performance today! It shouldn\u2019t be hard for you to break the record I set back then.\u201dAfter all, the normal trope would go like this:\u00a0\u2018Chu Wuji would plot against Gu Xian\u2019er, but Gu Xian\u2019er would discover his scheme. After that, he would show his true face and ridicule Gu Xian\u2019er, and tell her that she wouldn\u2019t be able to climb the Heavenly Dao Road. At the same time, he would have invited everyone in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace to witness her make a fool of herself.\u2019\u2018In the end, Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s incomparable performance would slap everyone in the face. At the same time, she would also slap her evil big brother in the face by breaking his record. She would also take this opportunity to challenge him in front of the world!\u2019Gu Changge was more than familiar with this setting, but how could this setting give him any trouble? He had multiple methods to deal with this nonsense.Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s mind went into a turmoil as she heard his words.\u201cGu Changge, do you really believe I can break your record?\u201dGu Xian\u2019er finally came back to her senses after a while, and her attitude towards Gu Changge also softened as she questioned him.Perhaps it was because of what Gu Changge did just now, but she felt that it would have been great if Gu Changge hadn\u2019t done what he did back then. She would have loved to have a loving and strong elder brother like Gu Changge!Right now, her mind was in confusion. Chu Wuji and everyone else believed that she wouldn\u2019t be able to break Gu Changge\u2019s record, so why did Gu Changge believe that she could?This puzzled Gu Xian\u2019er.Shouldn\u2019t Gu Changge look at her with contempt and say, \u201cA mere wench like you wants to break my record? Gu Xian\u2019er, stop dreaming!\u201dShe had imagined many outcomes in her mind already. Thanks to the teachings of her master, she was much smarter than her peers, and could easily infer a lot of truths that others couldn\u2019t.Those who treated her well were only after her body!She couldn\u2019t understand why Gu Changge believed in her for no reason, though.Gu Changge\u2019s calm expression showed no change, and he lightly shook his head in response to her words, \u201cIf I, your Elder Brother, wouldn\u2019t believe in you, then who would? Your hard work has always been in my eyes.\u201dThose words were nothing more than nonsense, of course. He didn\u2019t know what Gu Xian\u2019er had gone through over the years, but he had to create an appearance of knowing her bitter struggle and hatred for him.That\u2019s right, he was pretending!Still, Gu Xian\u2019er felt her heart tremble at his words. She wondered what he meant? Did he really know how much hard work she had put into improving herself for revenge over the years?Then, why did he do all that back then? Why did he dig out her Dao Bone?She couldn\u2019t comprehend just what was going on.Could he be in a difficult situation, and had no choice but to dig out her Dao Bone back then?She shook her head, and quickly suppressed that unrealistic thought. Even if he had some difficulty, he wouldn\u2019t have done something that despicable! Mere difficulty couldn\u2019t explain that cruelty.\u201cWhy are you still standing there in a daze? Everyone is waiting for you to ascend the Heavenly Dao Road!\u201dGu Changge interrupted Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s contemplation with a smile. Gu Xian\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but glare at him in response, but she realized that she indeed had to climb the Heavenly Dao Road.Without any hesitation, she turned towards the Heavenly Dao Road, and turned into a brilliant ray of light as she climbed the steps.The Heavenly Dao Road was drowned in brilliant light, and with every step one took, one would see Immortal mist gush towards them. Various miraculous visions would appear, and one would see Heaven and Earth revolve before their very eyes.The Sun, Moon, and Stars could be seen falling apart. Mountains and Rivers would perish and dry up, and Seas would turn into mulberry fields, and nothingness after that.[Buzz!]As soon as Gu Xian\u2019er landed on the first step, a dazzling, golden brilliance bloomed under her foot like a golden lotus flower.She continued to move forward.Second step!Third step!Fourth step!Nothing could obstruct her steps, and she reached the tenth step in a single breath!All kinds of brilliance enveloped her, Immortal sounds reverberated in the surroundings, and Heavenly flowers bloomed in the Void around her. It was as if she was the daughter of the Dao loved by the world itself.All the Disciples and Elders were alarmed!The tenth step! It was already the limit of many Inner Sect Disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and they couldn\u2019t go beyond it. One had to know that they were no random people, and hardly anyone from the outside world could contend against them.Even Chu Wuji, the other True Disciples, and the Young Supremes of the other powers could only climb up to the fourteenth step.As for Gu Changge? He had climbed all the way to the eighteenth step!Eleventh step!Twelfth step!Before long, Gu Xian\u2019er reached the fifteenth step!Mystical, dazzling rays of light spread everywhere, godly silhouettes flew around, and threads of Immortal runes revolved around her. Gu Xian\u2019er was like a Heavenly Empress who had descended from Ninth Heaven!The surroundings were silent for a while, and then, everyone erupted.The Disciples and Elders were shocked!This was talent that had already surpassed many Young Supremes! Could it be that Gu Xian\u2019er could truly break Gu Changge\u2019s record?Before long, Gu Xian\u2019er crossed the sixteenth step. Sweat flowed down her forehead, but the light in her eyes remained firm.She swept a glance at the people below the Heavenly Dao Road, and came across Gu Changge\u2019s gentle and natural expression that showed his confidence in her.She couldn\u2019t tell why, but she felt a sudden burst of energy wash through her limbs, giving her new life as she rushed up the Heavenly Dao Road.Seventeenth step!Eighteenth step!She reached the same step as Gu Changge!The people in the surroundings burst into discussion. Their eyes widened, and they almost fell to the ground. They were shocked, and couldn\u2019t believe what they saw!\u201cTrue Disciple Gu\u2019s record is going to be broken!\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t come here in vain!\u201d\u201cWho would have thought that she would really reach that step! It\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s incredible! It\u2019s unbelievable! It\u2019s as if I am in a dream!\u201dThe disciples who had previously looked down on her now felt as if their eyes would fall out!Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s face turned pale, and sweat flowed down her forehead as she stood on the eighteenth floor. She felt a horrifying pressure descend upon her, and she had to struggle to stand on her spot.Still, she did have the strength to move one more step forward!Not just her, but even those in the surroundings felt that Gu Xian\u2019er could take another step and break Gu Changge\u2019s record from that year.Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s next move, however, surprised them. With a calm expression on her face, she stopped in her tracks. After that, she turned around and moved down the Heavenly Dao Road instead of continuing upward!The surroundings turned dead silent.No one expected her to stop and return at such a juncture.She had such a good opportunity to break Gu Changge\u2019s record and become famous throughout the world!How could she give up just like that?VILFIC, the SLAVE: Chapters in the backlog: 9 (5th + 6th + 7th of February) FML | Backlog will be made up next week.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone stared at her and tried their best to make sense of what she did. After all, she gave up on such a great opportunity to gain immense fame in the world!The eyes of countless disciples turned red in envy, and their breathing hastened.How many could reach the eighteenth step?Why didn\u2019t she continue forward?Anxiety clawed at their hearts in Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s stead. Were they in her place, they would take that final step no matter what it cost them. After all, it was the only chance for one to surpass Gu Changge, and receive the praise and admiration of millions of people.Even the Elders couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads and sigh. They couldn\u2019t understand why Gu Xian\u2019er gave up on such a great opportunity, and intentionally tied her record with Gu Changge\u2019s.In their opinion, Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s identity from today would be completely different from before, and her acceptance as the Great Elder\u2019s disciple was a forgone conclusion.Alas! She had missed the opportunity to surpass Gu Changge, and won\u2019t have another such chance.Even the Great Elder, who was watching everything from far away, couldn\u2019t help but be puzzled at the result in front of him. He had watched the battle between Gu Changge and Chu Wuji, and the result of their exchange came as a complete surprise to him; he never thought that Gu Changge would be able to crush Chu Wuji without breaking a sweat.Gu Changge was definitely the best talent among the innumerable ones he had seen over countless years.\u00a0 From now on, he couldn\u2019t depend on Chu Wuji and the others to keep the position of Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s heir from him, so he had decided to put his hopes on Gu Xian\u2019er.Even if she couldn\u2019t break Gu Changge\u2019s record, he had already decided to accept her as his disciple. But what puzzled the Great Elder was Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s choice to give up midway, even though she could clearly go another step forward.Was there something between Gu Xian\u2019er and Gu Changge that he wasn\u2019t aware of?Or did she have some other considerations?Gu Xian\u2019er slowly walked down the Heavenly Dao Road. Her visage looked Heavenly, and her figure dressed in blue appeared lithe and slender.Every step she took was firm, and she showed a calm expression.She had no regret or feelings of unwillingness on not breaking Gu Changge\u2019s record; she merely shook her head when she watched the expressions on the faces of everyone around her.She could already tell that the reason Gu Changge felt so confident in her was because he simply didn\u2019t care about his record. If Gu Changge stepped on the Heavenly Dao Road now, he would definitely be able to climb much higher than before.Although talent was destined, and many spent their lives without much attainments, Gu Changge was different. How else could he receive so many titles and praises right from his birth?Not only did Gu Changge possess her Dao Bone, but he also had his own Innate Talent as well! As for what it was? No one could tell.So, what could she prove even if she broke her record?Was there a need for her to prove that she was more talented than Gu Changge of that year?There was no such need.\u201cXian\u2019er, why did you stop? Elder Brother believes you could have taken a few more steps.\u201dAlthough Gu Changge already knew the reasoning behind her actions, he still shook his head with regret when he saw Gu Xian\u2019er walk down the Heavenly Dao Road. It was as if he truly felt regret over Gu Xian\u2019er not going beyond the eighteenth step, and truly believed that she could go a few more steps without a hurdle.Gu Xian\u2019er only glanced at Gu Changge once, and didn\u2019t bother answering him.She wanted to stop him from calling her Xian\u2019er this, Xian\u2019er that, but when she thought about going through with the act, she felt uncomfortable for some reason.He was obviously her greatest enemy whose bones she wished to grind, and whose flesh she craved to devour, and whose blood she desired to drink, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel helpless in front of him\u2026he was always appearing in front of her, and deliberately pissing her off.Her masters were shameless, true, but they were nothing compared to Gu Changge. Sure enough, the wise words of the ancients weren\u2019t wrong:\u00a0\u2018only the truly shameless ones can be invincible in the world!\u2019There was no end to Gu Changge\u2019s shamelessness.If she could beat Gu Changge, then she would have definitely ignored everything right now and smacked him down until he turned into meat paste.\u201cI don\u2019t care about what you think!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er spat out and moved her head away.\u201cI don\u2019t want to care about you either, but you disappointed me! I expected so much from you, yet that\u2019s the best you could do in return?\u201dThe smile on Gu Changge\u2019s face disappeared as he heard her words, and he responded with a mocking tone.\u201cGu Changge, don\u2019t think you can bully me however and whenever you please\u2026\u201dGu Xian\u2019er could no longer keep her calm after she heard his words, and finally exploded. She was like a cat whose tail someone stepped on as she glared daggers at Gu Changge.Just what nonsense was he spewing?Although she knew that Gu Changge said those words to mess with her head, she couldn\u2019t take them.Others could say that, but he couldn\u2019t!It\u2019s as if she wasn\u2019t even allowed to fail his expectations, and had to do exactly what he said.If that wasn\u2019t enough, then his words also seemed to be full of mockery, as if telling her:\u00a0\u2018you wanna take revenge with that kind of worthless ability? Dream on!\u2019Gu Xian\u2019er had a strong ego, so she definitely couldn\u2019t allow Gu Changge to say that.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I think that? Do you really think you have any chance of stopping me?\u201dGu Changge\u2019s face full of mockery showed no change. He was bullying her, and he was enjoying it.Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s livid face almost exploded from rage.No one could have thought that just a few words from Gu Changge would be enough to enrage her to this degree. She desired to take out the Treasure Knife bestowed upon her by her master to chop Gu Changge into mashed meat.Various thoughts went through the minds of the surrounding Elders and Disciples as they watched the scene in front of them. It was clear to them that Gu Xian\u2019er held a deep grudge against Gu Changge, but Gu Changge still cared for her.His words clearly showed that he regretted the fact that Gu Xian\u2019er didn\u2019t break the record he set back then.As for why Gu Xian\u2019er didn\u2019t continue forward? It must be because of Gu Changge! She took him into consideration, and chose to stop.The two were truly a harmonious and loving pair of siblings, and many of the surrounding disciples felt envious of their relationship.Soon, the details of the entire event spread throughout the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace and its surroundings, causing a great sensation. It shocked many!In particular, the fact that Gu Xian\u2019er could reach the eighteenth step sent a violent wave through the world as various forces started to investigate her origins in secret.Finally, they came to know that she was indeed from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and seemed to be involved in some massive controversy inside the Family. As for what the controversy was? They couldn\u2019t find the details.It wasn\u2019t hard for an Ancient Immortal Family to suppress information. After all, they had stood tall through multiple epochs, so how could they not even have such a minor ability?For a time, Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s name became famous across various Heritages, and even reached the ears of innumerable Heavenly Geniuses.As for Gu Changge\u2019s act of utterly crushing Chu Wuji, another Young Supreme and True Disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace? That also shocked countless existences, and they felt that Gu Changge was even more unfathomable than before.As far as his peers were concerned, Gu Changge\u2019s uncontested strength put even more pressure on them. Many Young Geniuses and Heirs of various Heritages considered Gu Changge to be their nemesis, and didn\u2019t dare to underestimate him.The Descendents of Immortal Dynasties, Sects, Ancient Families, and Races felt a lot of pressure and sought opportunities to raise their strength. Some also entered Secluded Cultivation in hopes of achieving a breakthrough.\u2026\u2026[Ancient Immortal Ye Family, Mysterious Azure Heaven.]On a divine island shrouded in hazy brilliance and overflowing Spiritual Qi, a beautiful girl dressed in a purple skirt sat inside a palace and listened to all sorts of news about the outside world.The expression on her face changed constantly. Sometimes, she would show bewilderment, other times, she would appear to be in a daze.\u201cMy Lady, are you still down because of Ye Chen\u2019s matter? A few months have already passed, so you should let it go already.\u201dA middle-aged beauty with a worried expression stood beside the girl, and tried to persuade her.The two of them were none other than Ye Liuli and Aunt Xue, who had already returned to the Ancient Immortal Ye Family from the Lower Realm. After they separated from Gu Changge in the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm, they stayed in the Lower Realm for a while more, and had only returned to the Upper Realm recently.Ye Liuli\u2019s state over the past few months worried Aunt Xue. Sometimes, Ye Liuli would be in a daze, and sometimes, she would stand in a trance, as if she had lost her mind. When Aunt Xue asked her about her condition, she said that she was alright and whatnot, so Aunt Xue guessed that her condition was related to Ye Chen\u2019s death.Her Lady was probably heartbroken, and couldn\u2019t bring herself to accept the truth.Ye Liuli suddenly returned to her senses after listening to Aunt Xue\u2019s words \u2014 she was taken aback \u2014 and couldn\u2019t help but say with some feelings of disbelief, \u201cAunt Xue, what are you talking about? Ye Chen was just an ant, so how can his death affect me? Why would I be down because of him?\u201d [aye! Damn, boi got slaughtered and forgotten.]Aunt Xue was stunned as she heard her response, and wondered if her Lady was so heartbroken that she even forgot about Ye Chen?But that was also good.Forgetting someone like that was for the best. After all, her Lady almost offended Young Master Gu for that Ye Chen. She had recently heard a lot of rumors about Gu Changge, and couldn\u2019t help but feel some terror. Even if that Ye Chen didn\u2019t die down in the Lower Realm, he would have pissed his pants after somehow Ascending to the Upper Realm and learning of Gu Changge\u2019s true might.Aunt Xue couldn\u2019t help but show joy at this realization.\u201cMy Lady, you are correct! Ye Chen was just an ant, so why would you care about someone like him?\u201dYe Liuli responded to her with a nod, and then her expression turned serene once more. At the same time, she muttered to herself in her heart,\u00a0\u2018Why do I care so much about information related to Gu Changge recently? Also, why do I keep calling him Master unconsciously?\u2019Ye Liuli had a feeling that she had forgotten something important, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t recall what it was.Right then, a voice sounded from outside the palace, and a valiant youth dressed in a golden armor walked in. He seemed to be shrouded in the divine brilliance of the sun, and even his hair reflected off a bright light. He was just like a young Emperor with a strong vitality and incomparable aura and might.\u201cLittle Liuli, what were you thinking about with such attention? You didn\u2019t even notice my arrival.\u201dThe youth said with a smile, giving a refreshing feeling to whoever would hear his words.\u201cElder Brother? What are you doing here? Have you gotten any recent news about Gu Changge, the Young master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family?\u201dYe Liuli smiled when she saw the person who had arrived, and then asked the question in her heart. The youth in front of her was her Elder Brother, Ye Langtian, who was also the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family.Although he hadn\u2019t shown his might in the outside world, countless legends regarding him still floated around.He was known as a Reincarnation of an Ancient Emperor, and it was said that he was one of the few people who could compete with Gu Changge, the Young Master of Ancient Immortal Gu Family.A certain glint flashed through Ye Langtian\u2019s eyes as he heard his sister\u2019s question, and then he said, \u201cLittle Sister, why do you keep on mentioning Gu Changge again and again? I seem to have heard that he went down to the Lower Realm to look for something, so you must have come across him there, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you are missing him now?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t hard for him to reach this conclusion. What\u2019s more? He had heard some details from Aunt Xue.VILFIC, the SLAVE: Chapters in the backlog: 9 (5th + 6th + 7th + 8th of February) FML | Backlog will be made up next week.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySuccessor of the Ancient Emperor of Reincarnation; Yue Mingkong\u2019s Plan!Ye Liuli\u2019s face reddened at his words, and she responded with a weak snort, \u201cElder Brother, what nonsense are you speaking? Why would I miss him? I am just curious, after all, he\u2019s said to be a Young Supreme on the same level as you!\u201d\u201cI heard that he easily crushed the prince of the Great Chu Immortal Dynasty, and he has also broken through to the Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm; his strength is terrifying!\u201dAlthough her words sounded like a good explanation, how could Ye Langtian miss the meaning hidden behind them?Wasn\u2019t she just asking him what he thought of Gu Changge?She couldn\u2019t conceal her thoughts through trickery like this!Ye Langtian couldn\u2019t help but shake his head as he watched Ye Liuli\u2019s face full of expectation \u2014 he couldn\u2019t figure out how she crossed Gu Changge in the Lower Realm and ended up like this. He had heard some details regarding the matter from Aunt Xue about how Ye Liuli had offended Gu Changge and whatnot, and how Gu Changge had made her apologize to him without humiliating her too much or going too far.Could it be that Ye Liuli couldn\u2019t forget him anymore because of that?Ye Langtian pondered for a moment, and then said, \u201cI have also heard a lot about Gu Changge; he\u2019s my greatest adversary. The world calls me the Reincarnation of an Ancient Emperor, but he\u2019s known as a Reincarnation of a True Immortal. Reincarnation of an Ancient Emperor, Reincarnation of a True Immortal\u2026these titles already say a lot\u2026\u201dAncient Emperors were mighty existences who had carved a piece of land for themselves, expanded their territory, gathered immense wealth, and established supreme dynasties that stood for eras upon eras, but only True Immortals could be worshiped as Immortals, and that honor couldn\u2019t be availed by Ancient Emperors and the like.Although both titles sounded majestic, there was a great difference between the two.Ye Langtian understood this well.What\u2019s more? Gu Changge had already broken through to the Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm, while he had only just broken through to the Conferred King Realm, so the gap between the two wasn\u2019t all that small.Ye Liuli was shocked by Ye Langtian\u2019s response \u2014 even her elder brother thought of him like that, so Gu Changge must be even scarier than what she initially believed!As this thought crossed through her mind, she recalled the scene of a strange ancient god with an oppressive aura appearing majestically before, and that increased her fear of Gu Changge.Ye Langtian didn\u2019t have the time to notice Ye Liuli\u2019s strange expression. Right now, he was busy shaking his head and thinking about how he would need to compete with Gu Changge in the future. He was also a Young Supreme, so it went without saying that he would need to compete with his peers sooner or later. Still, he wasn\u2019t afraid of any challenge that could come his way.\u201cYoung Master, the boy named Ye Ling from the collateral branch is here again. He wishes to challenge you to make a name for himself, and he has already gathered a lot of people in the Martial Training Field.\u201dRight then, the voice of a servant sounded from outside the palace. Ye Langtian, who was talking to Ye Liuli, couldn\u2019t help but frown.\u201cYe Ling? Who\u2019s that? How can someone from a collateral branch dare to challenge Elder Brother?\u201dYe Liuli was surprised when she heard those words.Ye Langtian was the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, and even though he hadn\u2019t gone out to make a name for himself yet, it was a fact that he held immense might, so how could someone dare to challenge him?Did that person not want to live anymore, or was he just causing trouble?Ye Langtian responded to Ye Liuli\u2019s question with some annoyance in his tone, \u201cThat Ye Ling obtained the first position in the Family\u2019s competition recently, so the Family promised him three rewards, one of which was the permission to challenge and defeat me. He wants to avenge his father for back then when I hurt him by mistake.\u201d\u201cElder Brother, haven\u2019t we already paid them great wealth in compensation? I remember that they accepted the compensation and let the matter go\u2026\u201dYe Liuli was stunned by the details of the matter. They had already accepted the compensation, yet here they were now, asking for justice? No wonder even her mild-tempered elder brother felt annoyed by his pestering.\u201cHe\u2019s using that matter to further his agendas, and claiming that the Main Branch looks down on the Collateral Branches, and that caused quite a stir in the Family; a lot of the Elders scolded me over this already.\u201dYe Langtian said with deep annoyance showing on his face.The other party was a shameless rogue, and couldn\u2019t be handled easily. Even Ye Langtian, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, felt helpless when dealing with him. Not only could he not refuse the challenge, but he also had to give face to the Collateral Branches and suppress his cultivation in the fight.He wondered if seeking justice was just a pretense, and the guy was just taking this opportunity to make trouble for him?Soon, Ye Langtian left the palace and headed towards the Martial Training Field. Ye Liuli followed after him, desiring to see the so-called\u00a0\u2018Fight for Justice!\u2019\u2026\u2026[Supreme Immortal Dynasty, Imperial City.]In a quaint and majestic hall, the sun and moon appeared to be hanging high, and the universe seemed to be compressed inside it.Yue Mingkong was dressed in magnificent Imperial robes, and sat on a throne as she radiated an oppressive Imperial majesty. Her narrowed, phoenix eyes watched her trembling ministers as they reported the details of various events.\u201cYour Excellency, we have already settled the internal and external issues of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, so you don\u2019t need to worry about any opposition in the future.\u201dYue Mingkong nodded with a touch of satisfaction as she heard these words.\u201cWithdraw.\u201dThen, she waved her hand, and all of the ministers withdrew, and only a few of her confidants were left in the palace. Before long, Yue Mingkong sent them all out as well.Sitting in the hall alone, she rubbed her brows and tried to ease her tiredness as she tried to recall what would happen next. After all, she had to prepare for the future in advance. Even though she knew much about the future, life wasn\u2019t easy. If she didn\u2019t have knowledge of the future, her life would be even worse.Gu Changge was scary!\u2018According to the time, the Extreme Yin Heaven will soon appear in the world, and the Inner Region will fall into turmoil. After all, it\u2019s an ancient realm that will need multiple behemoths to open it\u2026this matter will soon become the top priority for all the Races and Heritages.\u2019\u2018All the great Heritages will work together to form the True Immortal Academy, and then they will select the best disciples from every faction to nurture as True Immortals\u2026\u2019\u2018The Immortal Road of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace should also appear soon. It must be the reason my good husband entered the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace and plotted for so long! I didn\u2019t even notice this fact back then.\u2019\u2018Now that I think about it, it must be the greatest reason for him to enter the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.\u2019\u2018When the Immortal Spirit emerged back then, all the Races and Heritages competed for it, and it even alarmed some Supremes into taking action\u2026alas! That resulted in no one getting their hands on the Immortal Spirit, and it disappeared not long after\u2026\u2019\u2018Now that I think about it, the Immortal Spirit must have been taken away by Gu Changge! Hehe, to steal food from under the eyes of various ancient monsters\u2026he\u2019s indeed my good husband.\u2019Yue Mingkong laughed at herself, but soon, her expression turned solemn.\u2018He is the inheritor of that Forbidden Art, so his real cultivation shouldn\u2019t be as simple as it appears. I was too impulsive in visiting the Ancient Immortal Gu Family the last time; my chances of survival would have been slim if he had wanted to kill me.\u2019\u2018I must make preparations for the future.\u2019Yue Mingkong faintly sighed as she thought of this.She had obtained no advantage on her trip to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. On the other hand, she discovered that the current Gu Changge was somewhat different from the one she knew from her previous life. The changes in him roused her suspicions, and disturbed her mind.She knew that Gu Changge was born with a demonic nature, and it was a matter that wouldn\u2019t be hidden from the world for long. The reason he dug out his young cousin\u2019s Dao Bone was for the sole reason of covering up his demonic nature.Of course, this incident didn\u2019t have much impact on Gu Changge.Talent of a True Immortal, and Demonic Nature\u2026this matter had shocked the world.She didn\u2019t know, however, where Gu Changge\u2019s demonic nature actually originated from; she guessed that it was related to his inheritance of the Forbidden Demonic Arts.\u2018Now that I think about it, Sister Xian\u2019er was such a kind person, yet she ended up with such a pitiful fate. Not only did Gu Changge dig out her Dao Bones in my previous life, but he must have also swallowed her cultivation base later, and that\u2019s why she disappeared. I was foolish to think that she let go of her hatred, and decided to live a life of seclusion.\u2019\u2018I must protect her in this life.\u2019As this thought crossed through her mind, Yue Mingkong felt that the burden on her shoulders had gotten heavier.Others might not know, but she was well aware of the fact that there was an incomparably powerful and mysterious master behind Gu Changge, who had only moved once in her previous life. It was that one move by him that prevented Gu Changge\u2019s Demonic Inheritance from getting exposed.Yue Mingkong guessed that Gu Changge\u2019s mysterious master was related to his Demonic Inheritance, and he would only take action when Gu Changge\u2019s Demonic Inheritance was about to be exposed.After all, why would he never show up otherwise?The Demonic Inheritance was something that couldn\u2019t be exposed no matter what! After all, even Gu Changge\u2019s powerful master could only tread in the dark because of it, so his fate could already be imagined if the matter somehow got out.In her heart, Yue Mingkong honestly didn\u2019t want to see the day when the matter of Gu Changge\u2019s Demonic Inheritance would come to light, and everyone related to him would turn on him for his life.\u2018What am I even doing? Aren\u2019t I just protecting him like this?\u2019Yue Mingkong quickly calmed down, and decided to go to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. Her trip was for the manifestation of the Immortal Road, as well as Gu Xian\u2019er.As her sister-in-law, she couldn\u2019t watch Gu Xian\u2019er go through hardship when she already knew what would happen to her.\u2018Hmm, the successor of the Ancient Emperor of Reincarnation should also appear any time now, no? He seemed to be called Ye Ling or something. He chanced upon the [Ancient Reincarnation Talisman] which contains the power of Reincarnation\u2026I must obtain this power!\u2019Yue Mingkong\u2019s phoenix eyes narrowed as she recalled another important matter.Ancient Reincarnation Heavenly Venerate! He was an extremely ancient existence with a cultivation base that allowed him to stand tall in Heaven and Earth. It was said that he controlled the power of the Six Paths of Samsara, which made it almost impossible for him to be killed off, and he had lived through countless epochs as well.She could take advantage of the fact that the Ancient Emperor of Reincarnation\u2019s successor had yet to grow up, and snatch the [Ancient Reincarnation Talisman] from him.Yue Mingkong began to make plans after thinking about this.\u2026\u2026[Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.]A white-robed old man with an Immortal-like bearing fished for something atop a mountain covered in clouds and hazy mist.\u201cThis Junior can\u2019t help but admire the Great Elder\u2019s leisurely and carefree life.\u201dA chuckling youth appeared on the mountain, and casually found himself a stone bench to sit on without caring for what the others around him thought. His expression showed as if he was sitting in his own backyard.\u201cGu Changge, just get to the point if you have something to say; you don\u2019t need to beat around the bush before me.\u201dThe Great Elder responded without a change in his expression, and continued looking straight at his fishline that went down the sea of clouds in front of him.He had no good feelings for Gu Changge, but Gu Changge didn\u2019t care about that.He smiled, and said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing much. I just wanted to thank the Great Elder for helping with my little sister\u2019s education.\u201dGu Xian\u2019er, who was expressionlessly standing behind him, tightened her hold on the jade sword in her hand, and desired to stab it through his heart from behind.Only a few people could visit the Great Elder\u2019s mountain on normal days, and Gu Changge had only been here once before. It was back when he joined the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and broke the record of the Heavenly Dao Road, which alarmed countless existences.Many thought that the Great Elder would accept him as his disciple, but reality was different from their imagination. The Great Elder merely brought him to his mountain, said a few words, and then sent him back without once mentioning anything about taking him as his disciple.Naturally, Gu Changge remembered his words very clearly. Back then, the first sentence that came out of the Great Elder\u2019s mouth was:\u00a0\u2018You have impure motives, a deep-seated demonic nature, and no shame.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am the Fated VillainCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI Was Afraid You Wouldn\u2019t Treat Her Well; Effort Bearing Fruit!Naturally, Gu Changge only responded to him with a snort, and told him that he wasn\u2019t dying to be the Great Elder\u2019s disciple either.Cultivators in the world had always avoided those with a demonic nature, especially people like Gu Changge, who were born with a demonic nature. The demonic nature didn\u2019t give off some aura, but instead, it was recognized by the actions and temperament of its holder.This result greatly disappointed the Great Elder, and his disappointment only deepened when he realized that Gu Changge was craving the position of the heir of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace\u2019s right after he joined the Palace.As for why? It wasn\u2019t hard for him to guess. After all, only the Elders or the heir could set foot in certain core areas of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, which were forbidden to the outsiders. The Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace held many secrets that interested even some ancient behemoths, after all.Gu Changge was definitely aiming for all that.What\u2019s more? The Ancient Immortal Gu Family seemed to have some other plots prepared for the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, so Gu Changge certainly didn\u2019t have any pure motives in joining the Palace from the get-go.Furthermore, Gu Changge\u2019s actions hadn\u2019t been any different from what the Great Elder expected from someone like him who was born with a demonic nature.Gu Changge dug out his cousin\u2019s Dao Bone, behaved arrogantly in the Palace, and had no respect for the Elders\u2026the Great Elder was an upright man, and had it not been for the rules of the Palace, he would have long kicked Gu Changge out of the Palace.\u201cXian\u2019er is so talented, with the supreme talent of a True Immortal, so this old man must naturally teach her. You, on the other hand\u2026why are you pretending to be a good person by running over here?\u201dThe Great Elder glanced at Gu Changge and said. He had seen countless people over his life, so how could Gu Changge conceal such trickery from him?Gu Changge showed no annoyance at his words, and, without a change in his expression, he said, \u201cPretending to be a good person? Great Elder, it seems that you hold deep-seated prejudice against me! I naturally wish for Xian\u2019er to succeed in the future and achieve even greater success than me, so why would I pretend to be a good person?\u201dGu Changge, too, had no good feelings for the old man in front of him, so much so that he didn\u2019t even bother to call himself\u00a0\u2018Junior\u2019\u00a0anymore.Anyway, the Great Elder dared not do anything to him.As for him saying that he was pretending to be a good person? Well, although he was correct, he had to bring out evidence to back his claim.\u201cIf you were so kind, would you dig out her Dao Bone to conceal your demonic nature?\u201dThe Great Elder would obviously not waste this opportunity to use this matter. Were the one standing in front of him someone else, he wouldn\u2019t even bother with them, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to stay silent when it came to Gu Changge.\u201cAbout that matter\u2026why don\u2019t you let it go already, Great Elder? Hasn\u2019t Xian\u2019er already grown a new Dao Bone?\u201dGu Changge responded with a shake of his head. It was obvious that there were some secrets that he couldn\u2019t expose about what happened back then.Gu Xian\u2019er, on the other hand, looked at Gu Changge with confusion as she heard their exchange.He wanted her to surpass him?Was he telling the truth, or merely spewing lies?Also, how did he know that she had already grown a new Dao Bone?The reality was obviously in front of her. Gu Changge had done nothing against her, and even let her go time and again even though she desired nothing more than to end his life.The more she thought about it, the more she felt that what happened back then wasn\u2019t simple, and there were some facts still hidden from her.Gu Changge\u2019s actions were completely different from what she had expected from him!It\u2019s just that Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t say the truth, and she couldn\u2019t bring herself to ask him either; the grudge between them couldn\u2019t be resolved with a few words, after all.\u201cThat\u2019s a grudge between you and Xian\u2019er, so this old man won\u2019t bother interfering in this matter. Speak already if you have anything to say besides this nonsense.\u201dThe Great Elder\u2019s expression sank, and he clearly wanted the uninvited guest before him to leave as soon as possible.Gu Changge showed a complacent expression, and said, \u201cSince Xian\u2019er is now the Great Elder\u2019s disciple, how can I, her Elder Brother, not come to take a look? Of course, what I am worried about is that the Great Elder might be too harsh on Xian\u2019er because of me.\u201dThose words were naturally not from the bottom of his heart, but he would lose nothing in saying them, so why not?The meaning behind his words was simple:\u00a0\u2018I am worried that you accepted Xian\u2019er as your disciple because of me, and that you will not treat her well, or teach her carefully. Who knows, you might be too harsh on her, and even scold her without reason!\u2019Of course, his words were said with the complete intention of infuriating the Great Elder, otherwise, he had complete trust in the integrity of the old man, and knew that he wouldn\u2019t make life hard for Gu Xian\u2019er just because of him.Not only could he use this opportunity to mess with the Great Elder, but he could also let Gu Xian\u2019er know just how much he, her Elder Brother, cared for her. He was so worried about her that he didn\u2019t even care about offending the Great Elder just to make sure he wouldn\u2019t wrong her!Sure enough, the Great Elder\u2019s expression changed and he showed deep rage as he heard his words. The world behind him darkened, and the wind picked up speed as the clouds changed their color and tumbled around.Thunder roared in the surroundings, and the aura of a mighty, enraged god descended upon everything.The sudden oppressive force and change in the atmosphere frightened innumerable disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace \u2014 their legs softened, and they almost fell to their knees.\u201cThat\u2019s where the Great Elder lives, right? What happened?\u201dThe expressions of many Elders also changed and paled, and their hearts trembled. They got to see the rage of the Great Elder after countless years of calm, after all.The Master is like running water, while the Great Elder is unchanging.This sentence wasn\u2019t just some nonsense in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. One could imagine the Great Elder\u2019s unfathomable might just from this sentence.\u201cGu Changge, don\u2019t talk nonsense! How can my Master be like that?!\u201dGu Xian\u2019er was also stunned, and hurriedly shouted towards Gu Changge. She never imagined that Gu Changge had appeared here with this motive, so she couldn\u2019t help but feel extremely complicated emotions surge through her heart.Gu Changge had completely offended the Great Elder with those words!Now that he had offended the Great Elder, his life in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace probably wouldn\u2019t be all that great, even if he was a True Disciple of the Palace.\u201cGood, good, good! It\u2019s the first time in countless years that a Junior has dared to speak like this in front of this old man. Although I know that you are deliberately trying to provoke this old man, I must say that you have succeeded.\u201dThe Great Elder was no ordinary man either, and it didn\u2019t take him long to suppress his rage. His angry glare disappeared, and he looked at Gu Changge with a smile, and said, \u201cIt would have been good if you didn\u2019t say all that, but now that you have said that, this old man will make sure to train Gu Xian\u2019er until she can easily suppress you!\u201d\u201cIf she can\u2019t do it, then this old man will step down from his position, and even give you the position of heir.\u201dThe Great Elder\u2019s proclamation stunned Gu Changge, but he wasn\u2019t surprised for long. Of course, his face still showed the same smile as before as he said, \u201cSince the Great Elder has said so, then I can also rest assured now. I am looking forward to the day when your words will come to pass.\u201d\u201cThis Changge won\u2019t take any more of your time.\u201dWith that said, Gu Changge took one last glance at Gu Xian\u2019er with a smile, and then directly turned into a ray of light that disappeared from the mountain.The surroundings also returned to their previous calm as the winds weakened, and the clouds stopped tumbling around.As for offending the Great Elder? Gu Changge couldn\u2019t be bothered by it.At the same time, a System Prompt sounded in his mind.[Ding! The Favored Daughter of Heaven, Gu Xian\u2019er, had her murderous heart shaken by you\u2026]The first step of his plan finally bore fruit.The mountain of the Great Elder was silent as a gentle breeze blew atop it, and clouds rolled around it.Gu Xian\u2019er lowered her head and didn\u2019t say anything.Right now, her heart was in turmoil. She knew well that Gu Changge was merely trying to provoke the Great Elder with his words, but at the same time, he forced the Great Elder to vow to teach her well.She could no longer comprehend Gu Changge\u2019s intentions.Won\u2019t the Great Elder putting more effort in teaching her be bad for Gu Changge?Why would he do something thankless like that?Was he trying to make up for what he did to her back then?Or was he plotting something even more sinister?Gu Xian\u2019er fell into a daze, and couldn\u2019t figure out just what Gu Changge was up to now.The Great Elder, on the other hand, could only sigh as he watched Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s complicated expression.\u201cHe will definitely have a place at the top of this world in the future.\u201dIf this remark were to spread, it would surely cause a massive sensation in all directions. How many people had received such a compliment from the Great Elder? What\u2019s more? His tone was completely affirmative as if the matter would come to pass without doubt.Gu Xian\u2019er lowered her head and kept her quiet at his words; she had no idea about what to say at this time.She was confused.She recalled the day when she met Gu Changge outside the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and realized that he indeed held no ill will towards her.Did he really want to make up to her for the past?Could it be that he just couldn\u2019t be honest and do everything without angering her due to his temperament?\u201cXian\u2019er, you don\u2019t need to worry about anything; since this old man said that, then this old man will naturally do as he claimed. Gu Changge was merely trying to anger this old man. As for why he acts like that? It can be attributed to his demonic nature\u2026\u201dThe Great Elder calmed down and shook his head as he watched Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s silent appearance.\u201cMaster, why do you think Gu Changge tries so hard to conceal his demonic nature? What could be the reason behind his demonic nature?\u201dGu Xian\u2019er suddenly asked him with a confused expression. Gu Changge wouldn\u2019t go that far just to hide his demonic nature, after all. He must be trying to hide its source, she thought.\u201cThere are many reasons for a person to have a demonic nature. This old man can\u2019t tell what caused Gu Changge\u2019s demonic nature, and you would need to ask him if you want to know the truth of this matter.\u201dThe Great Elder dismissed the matter with these words. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for people to be born with a demonic nature. Some would be born with a devilish soul, and others would be contaminated by Immortal Devil Qi, etc.He could only tell that Gu Changge had a strong demonic nature, as for where it came from? He would need to investigate his body before reaching a conclusion \u2014 he had no interest in something like that.Now, the Great Elder only wanted to help Gu Xian\u2019er surpass Gu Changge, so as to make Gu Changge regret his words.\u201cThank you, Master, I understand.\u201dGu Xian\u2019er responded with a nod. At the same time, she felt as if she had caught on to some clue.\u201cGu Changge\u2019s demonic nature is seated deep down his bones, and his actions are largely influenced by his demonic nature, too. If it weren\u2019t for his demonic nature, this old man would have long accepted him as his disciple.\u201dThe Great Elder couldn\u2019t help but sigh. He felt that a good seedling had been ruined because of his demonic nature.\u2026\u2026Gu Changge was in no hurry to plan for the future of Gu Xian\u2019er after he returned to his residence.First, he considered what he would be doing next. As for him offending the Great Elder? He had already pushed the matter to the back of his head and couldn\u2019t be bothered about the repercussions.With Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s wit and means, she would certainly want to investigate the\u00a0\u2018truth of that year\u2019\u00a0now that he had planted seeds of doubts in her heart. He had left her enough clues to reach the\u00a0\u2018truth.\u2019As for how he would arrange the\u00a0\u2018truth of that year,\u2019\u00a0he could worry about that later as he already had a solid plan in mind. For now, he decided to put aside Gu Xian\u2019er\u2019s matter for a while.\u2018Right now, what I need to focus on is the Immortal Road.\u2019Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but squint his eyes at this thought.According to the memories of his Original, there was an Immortal Road in the depths of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace that had disappeared a long time ago.According to various calculations, the Immortal Road would soon materialize in the world and bring with it a supreme opportunity. The reason he had coveted the position of heir of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace was to get that supreme opportunity hidden in the depths of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.\u2018Speaking of which, I should also merge the fragments of the World Seed and nurture a world inside me. When the time comes, I might be able to slip inside unnoticed with this ability combined with my Void Talent, and fish in troubled waters.\u2019As soon as Gu Changge thought of this, he opened his Attributes Panel, and found the three fragments of the World Seed listed in it.As Gu Changge busied himself with these matters, a majestic carriage pulled by nine divine phoenixes galloped through the boundless sky towards the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.Inside the carriage made of black gold sat Yue Mingkong dressed in a plain gauze dress. Her Immortal visage gave her a picturesque appearance, and her lustrous hair was tied up in a bun \u2014 she looked breathtakingly beautiful.Her eyebrows were like slender willow branches, while her phoenix eyes showed an incomparably deep calm. Right now, she was busy rubbing her glabella to ease her fatigue.\u201cMy good husband, it\u2019s really not easy to deal with you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He now had a huge sum of wealth in his coffers, but Gu Changge wasn\u2019t in a hurry to increase his cultivation.He went to look through the System Shop, and finally found what he desired after a while:\u00a0\u2018[Divine-grade Aura Concealment Talisman].\u2019It cost eight thousand Destiny Points.[ Item Introduction: Completely hides the user\u2019s aura for half an hour.]Although the feature didn\u2019t sound all that great, Gu Changge\u2019s expression still showed a touch of satisfaction. Since it was a product from the System, then it\u2019s ability definitely couldn\u2019t be doubted. It would most certainly be able to completely hide his aura, so where wouldn\u2019t he be able to go with his Void Talent\u2019s ability?Gu Changge immediately exchanged for a [Divine-grade Aura Concealment Talisman] without feeling distress over the loss of Destiny Points. After all, he was about to vie for a supreme opportunity that was said to be so great that even Supremes would come out for it.After that, he exchanged a thousand points of Fortune Value for another ten thousand Destiny Points, and exchanged the Points for a [Domain Traversing Talisman] and a [Formation Breaking Talisman].The [Formation Breaking Talisman] did exactly what it\u2019s name suggested:\u00a0\u2018it broke formations and other such restrictions.\u2019As for the [Domain Traversing Talisman]? It could help him escape at a critical moment.These were his so-called multiple layers of protection.After that, Gu Changge began to merge the fragments of the World Seed. Immediately, his vision blurred, and the three seeds of different shapes appeared in front of him and showed him a majestic scene as they merged together.Countless complicated runes spread around, and a world in its infancy opened right in front of Gu Changge. The sun rose and the moon circled around the world; mountains and rivers appeared, and an ancient sea gushed forth. The world evolved in front of him in an extremely bizarre manner, and kept on expanding.[Buzz!]A hazy glow radiated in the surroundings as the three seeds completely fused together, and turned into a gushing glow.Gu Changge felt the oppressive aura of the entire world press down on his chest \u2014 it was an extremely vast and boundless aura of chaos.Before long, the chaos subsided, and the scene cleared up as the murky glow sank.Heaven and Earth evolved inside him, and a mysterious and expansive world was born within him!The world was finally born!Inside him, the sun and the moon hung high, the stars adorned the sky, and auspicious clouds floated above the ground, forming an enclosed cycle of life. Although the world wasn\u2019t too big, it had the complete form of a recently-birthed world.\u2018Not only did I succeed in fusing the fragments of the World Seed, but I also nurtured a world inside me in one go.\u2019\u2018The feeling of having a world in the palm of my hand is refreshing, indeed. I can throw in whatever I want.\u2019\u2018If I come across a mighty foe, I can even hide inside the world. As long as I don\u2019t come across a mighty being who is good at creation and spatial travel, I will be good.\u2019Gu Changge looked at the Destiny Points that were reduced by thousands at once, but wasn\u2019t bothered by the expense.He pondered for a while, and then\u2026[Buzz!]The Void around him fluctuated, and in the next moment, his entire person disappeared from his spot without leaving behind many fluctuations.If anyone were to see him at that moment, they would have been shocked and left dumbfounded.Gu Changge had simply disappeared into thin air!His method was too appalling.However, if one with the ability of creation saw the changes in the surrounding, they would immediately find some strange fluctuations. Gu Changge didn\u2019t disappear into thin air, instead, he opened a spatial channel and rushed into another world.Gu Changge\u2019s figure appeared atop a mountain in the world he created through the World Seed.As he watched the surroundings and spread his Spiritual Sense all over the place, he realized that the world only had a radius of a few thousand miles. Although there were mountains, rivers, ancient trees, and some ordinary creatures, there was no Spiritual Qi.Beyond the developed world was undeveloped chaos, so Gu Changge couldn\u2019t help but fall into thought.The World Seed given by the System was most likely the best of its kind. The endless chaos evolving in the distance reminded him of how the world was said to have evolved in ancient times in his previous life. He could infer from this that the current world inside him was merely in its infancy, and that he would need to expand it further in the future.Now that he was here, he could even use it as a foothold for all his plots in the future.Gu Changge estimated that the world could further evolve to the highest possible point in the future. It wouldn\u2019t be impossible for it to grow into an entire Universe inside him.Of course, the world could also serve many other purposes, such as:\u00a0\u2018confining and suppressing enemies, appearing in the outside world as a world of its own, or even devouring the original world that was outside him\u2026\u2019Gu Changge recalled many myths as he thought of how he could use his newly-birthed inner world.In the beginning, there was nothing, but then Chaos came into existence; Chaos birthed the three thousand Chaotic Fiend Gods among which was Pangu; Pangu then split Heaven and Earth.Hongjun preached and the Three Pure Ones appeared; Nuwa created man, and Suiren taught them how to make fire from wood.It wouldn\u2019t be impossible for something similar to appear in Gu Changge\u2019s inner world.Gu Changge fell into thought for a while, and then asked the System,\u00a0\u2018System, can I upgrade the inner world with Destiny Points?\u2019[Destiny Points are applicable on everything. As long as you have enough Points, you can upgrade whatever you desire.]The System responded.Gu Changge nodded, and then immediately put Destiny Points into the upgrade of the inner world.[Boom!]Soon, a group of magnificent and majestic palaces rose from the ground behind him, like quaint Heavenly Pavilions that stood tall between Heaven and Earth. Their immeasurably tall pillars alone could support the sky above, just like the Heavenly Palace in the ancient myths.Gu Changge\u2019s figure disappeared from his spot and appeared inside the grandest Palace, and he resembled a deity who lorded over the Heavens and everything above and below them.He couldn\u2019t help but nod with satisfaction.\u2018It\u2019s so captivating; wouldn\u2019t it be better for me to just wait in here until this world surpasses the original?\u2019The establishment of his personal Heavenly Court didn\u2019t cost him much. After all, the inner world belonged to him, so it wasn\u2019t hard for him to make changes to it.Afterwards, Gu Changge returned to the original world and fell into thought inside his residence. For now, he could put aside the matter of his inner world \u2014 he had to focus on the Immortal Road that would appear soon.He had already prepared everything, and now, he was merely waiting for the right opportunity. It\u2019s just that he didn\u2019t know the exact time for the Immortal Road\u2019s appearance.But soon, Gu Changge recalled someone who might. His wife\u2014 no, his future wife.Yue Mingkong!Since she was a regressor, she must know when the Immortal Road would appear. It\u2019s just that it won\u2019t be easy to get her to talk.Moreover, if Gu Changge hadn\u2019t guessed wrong, then Yue Mingkong would most likely be on her way to the Immeasurable Heaven[1]. After all, he was her greatest foe in the original timeline, so if she desired to take revenge on him, she had to get this opportunity.[1: it\u2019s the region where the Dao Palace is located.]As for him stealing his wife\u2019s opportunity? Gu Changge felt not a shred of guilt about it.She belonged to him, so the opportunity also belonged to him, naturally.What\u2019s more? Could stealing your wife\u2019s opportunity even be called stealing?Gu Changge knew well that he couldn\u2019t clear Yue Mingkong\u2019s deep-seated hatred towards him in a day or two. Maybe, she would get used to him and give up after a while after getting bullied at his hands.He was already treating her with immeasurable kindness by not killing her outright. After all, although he was evil, he wasn\u2019t a crazy devil who craved blood and nothing else.Be it Gu Xian\u2019er or Yue Mingkong, Gu Changge hadn\u2019t chosen the option to kill them off. It wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t do it, but that he felt that it would be too boring. If he did that, then what would be the difference between him and the Original who was dominated by his demonic nature?[2][2: Buddhist Holy Land flashbacks. Thousands upon thousands of souls cursing you from the Netherworld, bruh.]\u201cYan Ji\u2026\u201dSoon, Gu Changge\u2019s expression returned to calm, and he called out for Yan Ji through a Communication Talisman.Yan Ji obviously followed him all the way to Immeasurable Heaven; it\u2019s just that she usually hid in the dark and wouldn\u2019t show up easily. Because of this, only a few in the Immeasurable Heaven knew that he had a Great Sacred Realm subordinate beside him.One had to know that even some Elders of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace had yet to reach this level!Soon, the Void in front of him fluctuated, and Yan Ji walked out, and respectfully greeted him, \u201cYoung Master.\u201dEver since she returned from the Land of Forsaken Immortals, she had been recovering from her serious injuries that she received from the attack of the peach blossom thrown at her by that mysterious peach tree.Had she not reacted in haste and opened a spatial tunnel using the [Domain Traversing Talisman], then she would have probably spent an eternity buried in that place.Gu Changge glanced at her, and then asked with a slight nod, \u201cHow\u2019s your injury?\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern, Young Master. The Medicinal Pills you gave me have almost healed my injuries.\u201dYan Ji replied with feelings of respect and gratitude.Gu Changge had been very kind to her. After she was injured, he kept on giving her healing medicines and elixirs of great quality, and also made sure to not arrange any tasks for her so she could recuperate without worry.Now that he finally called for her, the first thing he asked her was the state of her injury, so Yan Ji couldn\u2019t help but feel moved. Although she didn\u2019t show anything on her face, the gratitude in her heart was immense. How many people would be so considerate of others?\u201cThat\u2019s great; I have a task for you.\u201dGu Changge said with a nod.\u201cYoung Master, give me your command.\u201dYan Ji said.\u201cHelp me find the whereabouts of the fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty in the Immeasurable Heaven. Also, make sure you aren\u2019t noticed by her.\u201dGu Changge said.There was no way Yue Mingkong wouldn\u2019t come to Immeasurable Heaven. It\u2019s just that he was sure she would come quietly, find a place to hide, and make sure he wouldn\u2019t know her whereabouts.After he\u00a0\u2018dealt\u2019\u00a0with her back in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, Yue Mingkong had gone above and beyond in hiding from him.Gu Changge naturally saw through her measly tricks, but he had to have her appear in front of him now. Since she had come to the Immeasurable Heaven, then there was no reason for her to not see her husband.How could he not know what Yue Mingkong was plotting?\u201cIf you are noticed by her, then just show up and tell her that I will personally go out to catch her if she doesn\u2019t come to see me.\u201dGu Changge suddenly added with a playful expression.\u201cUnderstood, Young Master.\u201dYan Ji left as soon as she received her orders.She naturally knew of the relationship between the fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty and Gu Changge.The fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty was a favored daughter of heaven with immense fame in the Upper Realm, and she was also the Crown Princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty. Even though she was already engaged, there were still countless geniuses and favored sons of heaven who professed their love for her.The most important matter was that she had heard rumors in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family that the fourth princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty was head over heels for Gu Changge, but Young Master Gu always treated her with indifference and never cared for her.Yet now, the fourth princess seemed to be avoiding Young Master Gu? Why was that?Yan Ji was somewhat puzzled. From what she had seen of Gu Changge\u2019s temperament, he was certainly not the kind of person to treat someone like that.Could it be that he disliked the fourth princess for some reason?Alas! It was useless for her to think about this matter. After all, it wasn\u2019t something she could easily speculate about.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, some people noticed a colorful, immortal mist gush forth from the place where the light burst from.But soon, the Elders of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace made a move and suppressed the visions, and covered it from the prying eyes of the onlookers.Such a scene caused a sensation throughout the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace \u2014 it shocked the many disciples, and they soon spread the news around.At the same time, massive waves went through the world outside of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace as the informants of the major Heritages, Races, and Orthodoxies passed the news back to them.With every passing day, the situation in the Inner Region of the Upper Realm got more and more turbulent. Many speculated that something was birthed in the depths of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, and that had caused the phenomenon.There were various rumors floating around in the Upper Realm that the depths of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace held a mysterious, ancient continent whose roots could be traced back to the Primordial Era of Immortals. It was said that the continent was moved to the depths of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace by supreme powerhouses of the time.The continent was said to contain supreme opportunities like Immortal Scriptures, Divine Inscriptions, and whatnot other Immortal Inheritances which seemed to have been memorized only by the Elders of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.On normal days, the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace guarded that area with their strongest might, and it would be impossible for outsiders to approach it without permission. But once the divine light rushed to the sky, the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace found itself pushed to make a choice as the various Heritages and Races showed an intent to move.On normal days, all the opportunities belonged solely to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, but now that the opportunity had shown itself before the world, there was no reason for them to let the Palace monopolize everything.Many mighty figures of the various Heritages and Races had once studied in the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, so they obviously couldn\u2019t bring themselves to say that to the Palace\u2019s face, so they planned to send their young disciples and family members to the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.Immeasurable Heaven turned extremely lively for a while as various divine lights, chariots, and warships, etc. came from all sides.\u2026\u2026[In a remote Ancient City of Immeasurable Heaven.][Boom!]The black-gold carriage pulled by the nine phoenixes galloping through the sky landed in the ancient city, and attracted the attention of many cultivators in the surroundings.They reckoned that the identity of the person inside the carriage couldn\u2019t be simple if they dared to flaunt their might like this.Many began to guess the identity of the carriage\u2019s master.Immeasurable Heaven had been very lively over the past few days, and they would see a large number of cultivators from various backgrounds rush towards the Heavenly Dao Ancient City, so they couldn\u2019t help but wonder why such a noble carriage had descended to a remote place like this?A black-clothed man with an ordinary appearance, tall stature, and a thoughtful expression raised his head and looked outside his attic after noticing the sudden movements outside.\u201cHow come such a majestic chariot appeared in a place like this? From the runes and patterns on it, it appears to be someone from the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, no?\u201d\u201cThe one inside must have an extraordinary identity if they can get nine phoenixes to pull their carriage. Could it be some prince or princess?\u201dThe man dressed in black muttered to himself.If one looked closely at him, they would see a black pendant hanging on his chest. Every now and then, mysterious runes would flash around the pendant, and it also glowed.\u201cSpeaking of which, this place isn\u2019t all that far from the Heavenly Dao Ancient City; it won\u2019t take much time to reach it if one rushes towards it.\u201d\u201cI heard that the number one beauty of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, Princess Yue Mingkong, has the appearance of an Empress! Could she be the one inside the carriage?\u201dA strange smile appeared on the youth\u2019s face as he muttered these words. At the same time, he showed a thoughtful expression as he watched the black-gold carriage in the distance.Right then, a desperate voice sounded from inside the black pendant on his chest.\u201cBrat, don\u2019t forget what we are here for! There\u2019s an opportunity for you inside the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.\u201d\u201cWhy the heck are you turning jelly over a woman you haven\u2019t even seen?! The princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty isn\u2019t someone you can reach right now.\u201dThe youth in black showed an unhappy expression as he replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal if I go and take a look at the newcomer? Who knows, the person inside might not be a princess. Speaking of which, why would a princess from the Supreme Immortal Dynasty even come to a place like this?\u201dWith that said, the youth stood up and walked out towards the carriage while ignoring the persuasions of the voice inside the pendant.\u201cYour Excellency, we have arrived at the Black Stone Ancient City.\u201dThe voice of a respectful old woman in white robe sounded from outside the carriage, and reminded her master sitting inside.The one inside the carriage was none other than Yue Mingkong who was lost in a daze.The words of the woman brought her out of her daze, and she narrowed her eyes and nodded as she watched the scenery outside.\u2018Black Stone Ancient City; from what I recall of my previous life, Ye Ling, the successor of the Ancient Emperor of Reincarnation, first made a name for himself in the Black Stone Ancient City.\u2019\u2018That guy gained immense fame within a few days of time, and even Ye Langtian, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, suffered a massive loss at his hands in their first bout. If that wasn\u2019t enough, then Ye Ling beat him down even more in their later battles.\u2019\u2018Ye Ling rapidly rose and became a shining star of the Inner Region in a short period of time. His reputation overshadowed even my good husband\u2019s for a while. What\u2019s more? He had a lot of friends and confidants around him all the time as well! The Young Master of the White Tiger Family, the Young Master of the Purple-Winged Dragon Family, and others with such powerful backgrounds gave him a boost.\u2019Yue Mingkong thought so in her heart.She naturally came here for the [Ancient Reincarnation Talisman], which was in the possession of the Ancient Emperor of Reincarnation\u2019s successor.The [Ancient Reincarnation Talisman] contained the Dao of Reincarnation, which was an extremely mighty force that could even contend with Gu Changge\u2019s Forbidden Inheritance\u2019s abilities.She didn\u2019t understand much about these matters at first, but she found this information after looking through countless ancient records and inscriptions over the last period of time.No matter what, she had to snatch the [Ancient Reincarnation Talisman]!Still, she was well aware of the fact that the man named Ye Ling was no simple character. Ye Langtian was regarded by the outside world as a Young Supreme who stood on equal footing with Gu Changge, so there was nothing to say about his extraordinary means.Yet, even as a Young Supreme and the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, he was pummeled by Ye Ling.In her previous life, Ye Ling was one of the many brilliant youths who suffered at Gu Changge\u2019s hands. She wasn\u2019t sure if he died later or what, but it was a fact that he had disappeared for a long time.\u2018In my previous life, Ye Ling was still almost killed by my good husband even with the [Ancient Reincarnation Talisman] in his hands, so I must be careful even after I get it from him.\u2019Soon, Yue Mingkong\u2019s expression showed calm, and her deep and indifferent phoenix eyes looked outside the carriage. She had already spread around a [Heaven and Earth Confinement Formation], and was now waiting for Ye Ling\u2019s arrival.As for why she was sure that Ye Ling would appear?From her memories of the previous life, Yue Mingkong already knew that Ye Ling seemed to admire her greatly for some unknown reason. After becoming the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, he proclaimed before her that he would snatch her away from Gu Changge.She naturally sneered at his delusion, and because of this matter, he was almost killed by Gu Changge, and then disappeared.At first, she had thought that Gu Changge was offended by Ye Ling, but now that she thought about it, she realized that there was a high chance Gu Changge took the opportunity to attack him for the [Ancient Reincarnation Talisman] as well.Gu Changge had plotted for innumerable opportunities, so there was no way he would let go of the [Ancient Reincarnation Talisman].With these considerations in mind, Yue Mingkong directly came to the Black Stone Ancient City.She believed that Ye Ling would definitely show up after he saw the markings of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty on her carriage, if he was in the city, of course.There were countless women around Ye Ling in her past life, so she could already guess his nature.\u2018Ye Ling\u2019s cultivation base should only be in the initial stages of the Conferred Lord Realm, so I will definitely be able to bury him in this place today.\u2019Yue Mingkong thought that with a frosty, indifferent expression. She was like a supreme Empress who could dictate the life and death of all around her.She couldn\u2019t care less about a mere Ye Ling \u2014 to her, he was nothing more than an ant. Of course, she had made a lot of preparations to make sure she could thoroughly trample this ant.It didn\u2019t take long for Yue Mingkong to perceive someone\u2019s arrival. The newcomer was a young man with a strong cultivation and aura; it was clear that he had cultivated a mighty body-cultivation art.She narrowed her phoenix eyes, and waved her jade-like hand.[Buzz!]Tremors went through the void in the surroundings. At the same time, a shocking aura hidden in the dark finally surfaced and locked up the surroundings.\u201cThis is the mansion where that carriage just landed, right? Why do I suddenly feel uncomfortable?\u201dYe Ling stopped in front of a quaint mansion with a frown on his face. Although he loved beauties, he wasn\u2019t r3t4rd3d; he had avoided many life-threatening dangers because of his sixth sense warning him in advance. [1][1: When the Heavenly Daddy personally sends you spidy-sense signals even though you weren\u2019t bitten. Fr!ck him.]For some reason, he felt uneasy standing in front of the mansion.\u201cTurtle Bro, should I go in or not?\u201dYe Ling\u2019s face showed confusion as he asked for advice from the pendant around his neck.Back when he was young, he once went up a mountain to search for some magical herbs. It was on that adventure when he found himself falling into an underground cave where he accidentally discovered the black pendant and became the successor of the Ancient Emperor of Reincarnation.There was a remnant spirit of an ancient turtle inside the black pendant.The ancient turtle was the one he now called\u00a0\u2018Turtle Bro.\u2019\u00a0Turtle Bro claimed to be the mount of the Ancient Emperor of Reincarnation, who was looking for a successor for its master, the Ancient Emperor of Reincarnation.Ye Ling didn\u2019t believe it at first, but then realized that it seemed to be telling the truth.It was just that the old turtle had no other ability that could be useful to him. At most, he could teach him some common sense about the world around him, and nothing more.It was a plain and uncharacteristic turtle that didn\u2019t resemble the mount of an Ancient Heavenly Emperor.The old turtle couldn\u2019t help but roll its eyes at him in response, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a mansion, what\u2019s there to fear about it? Where\u2019s the boldness you show when you are picking those Jade Beauties?\u201dYe Ling felt that it wasn\u2019t wrong. He had never crossed the other party, so why would they harm him?He was overly suspicious over nothing.Ye Ling\u2019s courage soared as he thought about this. He had heard countless rumors about Princess Yue Mingkong, and yearned for her every day. If he could see her today, then the meeting between them couldn\u2019t just be a coincidence, but a work of fate itself, no?As for Princess Yue Mingkong being the fiancee of the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, Gu Changge? He couldn\u2019t give one sh!7 about that. After all, even Ye Langtian was nothing before him, so what could Gu Changge, who was said to be only as strong as Ye Langtian, do against him?[Boom!]However, in the very next moment after Ye Ling arrived outside the mansion, an indifferent and heartless voice sounded from inside.\u201cKill him!\u201d\u201cNot good!\u201dYe Ling\u2019s expression immediately changed as he heard the voice; he never thought that someone truly wanted to kill him.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014[VILFIC: I would be rich if I was paid per word. Dammit, repeating Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace and Ancient Emperor of Reincarnation and whatnot in the same damn paragraph isn\u2019t easy.
