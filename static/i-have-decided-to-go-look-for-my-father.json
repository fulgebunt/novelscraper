You can\u2019t bully her at home so you bully her at school?\u201dXu Jiaofeng held onto Lin Xi\u2019s arm with one hand and smacked her with her the other.\u201cShe fell into the lake by herself. It had nothing to do with me!\u201d Lin Xi fought the pain and denied any wrongdoings.Xu Jiaofeng got angrier. \u201cHow would Xinxin fall into the lake if you didn\u2019t do anything to her?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how she fell in there but it had nothing to do with me. There were others there and also surveillance video. You can go look into it if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\u201cYou are still denying it?!\u201d\u201cLike I said, I have done nothing.\u201dLin Xi looked at Lin Anxin who was standing behind Xu Jiaofeng.Lin Anxin had already changed out of her wet clothes by now. She was wrapped in a blanket and Song Kexin with her arms around her. She was slipping the ginger soup that Song Kexin was feeding to her.The incident started near the end of the school day \u2013 this afternoon, when Lin Xi walked out of the library, she saw many running toward the artificial lake and also heard that Lin Anxin got into a spat with someone and had fallen into the lake.By the time Lin Xi got over there, Lin Anxin was struggling in the artificial lake that was barely the height of one person. The teachers were not there yet and nobody dared to interfere.Lin Xi had no sympathy for her but, after some pondering, fished her out of the lake anyway and carried her over to the car that was there to pick them up.Low and behold, the moment they arrived home Lin Anxin quickly dashed from Lin Xi with a fearful look and threw herself at Xu Jiaofeng and Song Kexin. She merely mumbled when asked what had happened.With Lin Anxin behaving the way that she was plus the confusing description from the chauffeur who was responsible for dropping them off to and from school, it was only natural for Xu Jiaofeng to assume that Lin Xi was the one who pushed Lin Anxin into the lake.Lin Xi stared angrily at Lin Anxin and, enunciating one word at a time, said, \u201cLin Anxin, you tell them, did I push you into the lake?\u201dMeeting Lin Xi\u2019s eyes, Lin Anxin acted as though she was fearful. She retracted more into Song Kexin\u2019s arms and started sniffling. \u201cMom, I\u2019m so scared. Sniffle. I thought I was going to die and that I will not see you and Dad again, or my grandmothers.\u201dHer wronged look made Song Kexin and Xu Jiaofeng\u2019s hearts ached.\u201cWhat is this now? Are you trying to intimidate her some more?\u201d Xu Jiaofeng pulled Lin Xi away from Lin Anxin.Lin Xi gritted her teeth and cussed in her mind: Pretentious *.Who\u2019d drown in an artificial lake that was less than a meter deep?Lin Xi thought with contempt to herself before turning to look at Song Kexin, her own mother.Nevertheless, when their eyes met, Lin Xi could only see difference in her eyes, along with a hint of blame and resentment.\u201cApologize for your sister,\u201d said Song Kexin coldly.Lin Xi wanted to bust out laughing when she heard that.What had she expected? It had always been like this. Whenever there were conflicts between Lin Anxin and herself, she was always the one who was yelled at. Even the servants at home would say that she was envious of Lin Anxin.Lin Xi fought back her tears and wouldn\u2019t let them roll down her cheeks. Looking at Song Kexin, she asked, \u201cWhatever that Lin Anxin does are always right and whatever I said are always wrong?\u201dLin Xi\u2019s question only brought about Song Kexin\u2019s silence.\u201cI am not going to apologize,\u201d said Lin Xi as she tightened her fists. \u201cLet the person who lied today die a horrible death. She will choke herself to death when she drinks, be smashed by the roof when she sleeps, or hit by a car when she walks out of this door!\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had offended some hooligans at school and, this afternoon, Yan Xueqi brought her gang to pick on her and even asked her to meet by the artificial lake. She assumed they were just putting up a front but they were going to crop off her hair and throw paint on her. Lin Anxin, startled, started backing up from them and ended up slipping and falling into the artificial lake.Lin Anxin dared not tell the truth right now. Had she said it, her mother and grandmother would, doubtless, asked about what had happened. She had always put up a front that she was a nice and docile child in front of her family. She didn\u2019t want them to know that she had conflicts with other students and over that kind of issues no less.---Over on this side, Lin Xi was boxed on her ear again. Half of her brain rang from the blow.This time, she was struck by Song Kexin who just stood up.\u201cLin Xi, how could you talk like that?\u201d Song Kexin had a fierce look in her eyes.Xu Jiaofeng sneered as well. \u201cHow are you so vicious at such a young age?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the vicious one here?\u201d Lin Xi shouted out before she turned and ran upstairs.\u201cShe had completely lost it! Li-ma, stop her!\u201dXu Jiaofeng had the maid block Lin Xi but Song Kexin stopped her. \u201cForget it, Ma.\u201cGive her some time to reflect upon herself. As for Xinxin, we should have a doctor come and check her out.\u201dXu Jiaofeng\u2019s attention was turned immediately when Lin Anxin was brought up. She nodded and said, \u201cYes, we should have her checked out. The weather is getting cold and we wouldn\u2019t want her to get sick.\u201dXu Jiaofeng walked over and stroked Lin Anxin on her head. \u201cPoor Xinxin to have something so awful happened to you. You must let grandma know if you don\u2019t feel well, okay?\u201dLin Anxin nodded docilely.\u201cGood girl.\u201dXu Jiaofeng looked in the direction where Lin Xi ran in and sneered, \u201cShe lives in our house and we give her good food and drinks. How did we end up raising such a heartless, vicious thing!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve told you. You will not get good fruit from bad seeds no matter how hard you try!\u201dThat made Song Kexin felt awkward.\u201cMa, that\u2019s enough.\u201dXu Jiaofeng stopped awkwardly after seeing Song Kexin\u2019s face had dropped. She turned and asked the servant to fetch the family doctor.***On the other side, Lin Xi retuned to her room and lifted her hands to wipe the tears that she had stopped from falling.Her cold and wet school uniform made her face hurt. Lin Xi finally changed out of her wet school uniform expressionlessly.This very moment, a piece of nice-folded and completely soaked paper fell out from the pocket of her uniform.It was the report card from this month\u2019s examinations.Lin Xi unfolded the report card and carefully laid it out on the table. She spaced out while looking at her own report card \u2013 she ranked #1 in her entire grade. She had wanted to show them when she reached home.That being said, they probably wouldn\u2019t care about it anyway.Ever since she was a child, Lin Xi couldn\u2019t understand why no matter how hard she tried and how outstanding she was, she was never able to earn the approval of her family. From what she could recall, her father barely ever talked to at all. Her grandmother was crazy double standard between Lin Anxin and herself. Her mother, on the other hand, always gave her a strange and complicated look. It was as though she was a something subpar. She was always like a stranger in this house and Lin Anxin was the one that was a part of this family.Lin Xi didn\u2019t understand that. Didn\u2019t everyone said that an outstanding child would be loved? She had already done so much.***Lin Xi\u2019s thoughts were interrupted by a sneeze. She shuddered, held on tight to her sleepwear, jogged over to her bed, and rolled herself up with the blanket.Her icy-cold body finally felt a bit of warmth after a long while.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Song Kexin, her mother, was the female lead of this novel and Lin Yize, her father, was the male lead.Much like the beginning of many clich\u00e9 novels, the female lead had a father who was addicted to gambling and had a mounting debt. The female lead, for the sake of repaying the debt for her father, had no choice but to become the replacement lover for the male lead.Before the male lead had fallen in love with the female lead, he had belittled and was abusive to her in all sorts of ways. He even offered her up to the scums whom he had business relationships with for them to have their turns. The female lead was able to escape from the scums but wasn\u2019t able to get out because of the drink that they had given to her. Finally, she had intimate relationship with some strange man.The male lead only realized that he was in love with the female lead after that.The male lead regretted deeply for what had happened to the female lead and begged her for her forgiveness.Under the male lead\u2019s sincere apology and humble pursuit, the female lead, who had always been in love with the male lead secretly, finally chose to forgive him and the male lead also expressed that he would accept the child that the female lead was carrying as his own.Everything was perfect.But, over time, both the male and female leads began to be irked by this child. The existence of this child was a reminder of their past. The longer it had gone on, the worse they felt.Especially after their own child was born, the other child was, doubtless, a blemish that they were not able to overlook.Unfortunately, Lin Xi was that child that should not be born.***Words upon words and some fragmented scenes quickly flashed through Lin Xi\u2019s mind.Gradually, the words between twisted in her mind.After a long while, Lin Xi finally struggled to open up her eyes in bed.A splitting headache followed. Lin Xi tried to open up her mouth but her throat was so dried it felt like it had been burnt by fire. Her body, too, felt like it had been weighted down and she could hardly breath.Lin Xi struggled to picked up her cellphone by the bed and took a look at the time. She was surprised to find that she had been unconscious for over 24 hours.She felt very dizzy.That being said, her eyes were clear and, if one was to look carefully, there was shock in them as well.Lin Xi thought about the detailed content of the novel over and over again. If everything was true, then her current situation and the way that she was being treated by her family would all make sense.After all, she was an outsider to this family. In addition, she was the blemish in the romance between Lin Yize and Song Kexin.Lin Xi balled herself up inside her little blanket.She didn\u2019t end well in the novel either.In the extras of that novel, \u201cLin Xi\u201d was envious of her own sister. She was envious that Lin Anxin had taken from her the love from the family, the attention from others in school, the male god that she was fond of, and she continued to turn into a villainess. She would smear Lin Anxin\u2019s reputation in front of others and set her up with every means possible.When all was revealed, \u201cLin Xi\u201d was smeared by the entire internet and would receive lots of angry words and threats from strangers every day and also well-hated at school. Finally, everything that she had done backfired on her. She failed to set up Lin Anxin but was strangled to death in some gloomy and dirty alleyway.Lin Xi frowned: She would turn into a villainess because of Lin Anxin? And try to set her up?That made no sense to her whatsoever. She wasn\u2019t someone who would bother to do such things. And, truth be told, the evil plans that \u201cshe\u201d had carried out in the novel was like child play in her eyes.***In addition, there was an extra for said novel: Lin Yize finally became powerful enough and found that man whom his loved one had lost her v*rginity to. He retaliated him with all his might and was finally able to bring about his downfall both in terms of his reputation and his wealth.With the disappearance of \u201cLin Xi\u201d and that man, the last of the unpleasantness between the male and female leads finally went away altogether.***\u201cReally is Gu Shao\u2026?\u201d muttered Lin Xi to herself.If everything was the way it was, that man would be her real father.She was, however, very surprised that her real father was Gu Shao.--- Lin Xi\u2019s eyes landed on the newest issue of a Chinese technology magazine. Gu Shao was the man on the cover.An elite in the electronic field in China. Gu Shao was the boss among bosses.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was then when Lin Xi realized that she hadn\u2019t eaten in over a day.She felt nauseated as she hadn\u2019t eaten in a long time.Her fever had gone down but she still felt dizzy. She wasn\u2019t sure that was an aftereffect of the fever or that she was just hungry.Fighting her dizziness, Luo Xiu crawled out of bed.Her limbs were weak and she almost fell when her knees almost gave in.She steadied herself, walked out of her room, and went looking for food downstairs.It had obviously pasted meal time and it was quiet inside the mansion.She had been \u201cdisappeared\u201d into her own for one day and one night and it was as though she had already been forgotten.***She was half way down the stairs when she stopped abruptly.She could hear someone talking downstairs.One of them was Song Kexin.The other voice belonged to Zhang Cui, Song Kexin\u2019s mother, her grandmother.Zhang Cui was your typical woman from a village. She married a lazy gambler husband when she was young and had a rough first half of life. She finally divorced her husband with her daughter\u2019s support and moved into the house in City B that her daughter had arranged for her.She was the one talking right now.\u201cWhy\u2019s Yize out so late at night?\u201d There was a hint of anxiousness in her voice.\u201cSome investors came from overseas so he needed to go network with them.\u201d Song Kexin explained to her mother. \u201cEverything is fine. Don\u2019t worry, Ma.\u201d\u201cOkay. I am glad that everything is fine.\u201d Zhang Cui mumbled.Something occurring to her, Zhang Cui added, \u201cKexin, I think Yize is really upset over this incident this time.\u201d Her son-in-law had an awful look on him over dinner and only looked a little better when he was talking to Lin Anxin.Chen Kexin sighed. It sounded like she had let out a sigh.\u201cI\u2019ve told you. You should have aborted the child back then,\u201d complained Zhang Cui.Back then when Song Kexin decided to forgive the man, she did not tell her family the truth about how she came to be pregnant with the child in order for her family to have a better impression of him. She only told Zhong Cui that the child was an accident from a man that she had dated before she started dating Lin Yize.Naturally, Zhong Cui assumed that the real father of the child was some scum boyfriend of her daughter\u2019s. She had, in more than one occasion, chastised her daughter over that.Hearing Zhong Cui\u2019s words, Song Kexin\u2019s face dropped again.-- Of course she had thought about aborting the child. But she only found out that she was pregnant after she and Lin Yize had been together and she was already openly his fianc\u00e9e. Then she was photographed by the media when she headed to the OBGYN department at the hospital when she was debating about the abortion. All of a sudden, news of the Young Mrs. Lin about to give birth to their first child was all over the internet.She had no choice but to carry the child to terms to avoid any possible negative speculations or public opinions against Lin Yize.In addition, there was a little bit of ulterior motive in there as well. She wanted to use this child to test Lin Yize\u2019s love for her: If Lin Yize truly love her, he would accept her past and this child.Later on, she regretted about her decision.Lin Xi was like a rocky roadblock in her heart. She had caused her much pain and suffering. Because of her existence, there was always a blockage between her husband and herself.\u201cAye\u2026\u201d Zhong Cui, too, sighed when she saw Song Kexin biting her lips and remaining silence with a long face.\u201cIt\u2019s all in the past. There is no point in talking about it now.\u201cThat being said. We can\u2019t raise this child with Xinxin. Yize and your mother-in-law, not related to her, would never treat her the same as they treat Xinxin. The child will notice that and more so as she grows up.\u201d Zhong Cui paused for a little and said, worried. \u201cShe pushed Xinxin into the lake the time. She might do something even more dangerous next time.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think I should do then?\u201d Song Kexin frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s not of age yet. We can\u2019t just send her away nor can we have her live alone. That would seem even more odd.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to talk to you about. My idea is to send her to our old village for a while. Do you remember a man by the name of Zhang Qiang in our village? He was around 47 ~ 48 years old now. He didn\u2019t have a lot so he wasn\u2019t able to get married and has no children of his own. Lin Xi can go and live with him.\u201dSong Kexin\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Obviously, that had never occurred to her. \u201cYou mean to give Lin Xi away so Zhang Qiang can raise her?\u201dThat wasn\u2019t going to work. Maybe when she was younger. Lin Xi was old enough now to have her own thoughts. They couldn\u2019t possibly just give her away.\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Zhong Cui shook her head. \u201cZhang Qiang is a distant relative on your grandfather\u2019s side so he is a relative of ours of sort. When we send Lin Xi over, we will just say she is staying with a relative. It would sound just fine as well.\u201dSong Kexin was tempted but still with a little bit of hesitation. \u201cBut\u2026 that sounds wrong, no?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong about that? Sending her there will allow us to separate the two children and protect our Xinxin. Besides, villagers are simple and honest people. Staying there will stop the child from having other evil thoughts and becoming even worse than she already is.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sending her to the village will be good for you, Yize, our XingXing, and this family.\u201cIt\u2019s good for her as well. She wouldn\u2019t need to be envious of Xinxin without the contrast.\u201cAs for over here. You just need to make something up. You can say that she had gone overseas or out of town. Or that her health hasn\u2019t been good so she will be staying in the countryside for a while. In either case, there won\u2019t be any rumors.\u201d--- That sure made sense.Song Kexin nodded reflexively.\u201cHave you contacted Zhang Qiang yet then? Is he okay with it?\u201d asked Song Kexin.Zhong Cui patted Song Kexin on her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. I have already had someone asked. He didn\u2019t say he won\u2019t do it. All we need is to give him some living expenses every month.\u201dSong Kexin nodded: Living in the countryside is inexpensive. Paying some living expense is not a big deal.\u201cOkay, this is settled then.\u201d Song Kexin thought about it for a little bit and agreed. Being around Lin Xi all these years had wore her out. She didn\u2019t notice it before but she was more and more exhausted as time went on. She even felt that she had been unfaithful to her husband.\u201cI only worry about convincing Lin Xi\u2026\u201d said Song Kexin with a troubled look.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of that\u2026\u201d***Lin Xi had heard enough by now.She turned and quietly went back upstairs and into her own room. She pulled out a piece of bread that was already squashed in her backpack, took a couple of bites from it, and went back into bed.***It was mentioned in the novel that \u201cLin Xi\u201d had been sent to the living in the village by her grandmother.The guy Zhang Qiang seemed simple and affectionate at the beginning but revealed his true color the moment Zhong Cui had left.Zhang Qiang had no job nor did he farm. He lived off of government subsidy and could barely support himself. He never wanted children of his own or, at the very minimum, would prefer to have a son.He only accepted Zhong Cui\u2019s suggestion for the 500 yuan of monthly stipend.\u201cLin Xi\u201d stayed with Zhang Qiang for a few days and he didn\u2019t even let her go to school. He had her stayed home with him every day.He only had \u201cLin Xi\u201d help out around the house at the beginning \u2013 cooking, cleaning, washing his socks and underwear. Later on, he started touching her and even peeking at her showering.One day, he tied her up on the bed and was going to violate her.\u201cLin Xi\u201d fought with her life and finally knocked off the old circuit breaker in the house. The house caught on fire and she was finally able to break free.The entire village came over to help out or just watch the drama when Zhang Qiang\u2019s house was burning.When Lin Yize and Song Kexin found out about it, they worried that the matter would escalate and the media would find out about it so they paid Zhang Qiang a sum of money and brought \u201cLin Xi\u201d back home.In the novel, \u201cLin Xi\u201d was never hurt and had returned to her original family. Nevertheless, her personality started to distort after this one incident.***Lin Xi had goosebumps and felt revolted from recalling the details of the novel.-- She couldn\u2019t just sit around and do nothing about it. She must come up with a way to get out of it.Lin Xi quickly come up with idea in her head and try to figure out the most plausible option.***The servants at home finally recalled that Lin Xi existed and knocked on her door to come down for breakfast the next morning.Lin Xi changed into her school uniform and went downstairs.Lin Xi ate numbly over the dinner table.Nobody seemed to have noticed that she was not being herself today.Lin Anxin, sitting across from Lin Xi, gave her a look and asked in a low voice, \u201cAre you alright, Big Sister?\u201dSeeing that Lin Xi did not respond to her, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t blame you over the incident.\u201dHaving said that, she even gave Lin Xi a sweet smile.-- She was smiling because she was happy. She had heard from her mother and grandmother in her room when she got up this morning that they had planned to send Lin Xi away for a while. She had no idea why but it was definitely good news to her.Once Lin Xi was gone, the incident of her falling into the lake would be over and her family would never find out about the conflict between Yan Xueqi and herself.***Lin Xi snickered on her side.It might sound like the incident had nothing to do with Lin Xi but Lin Anxin\u2019s tone suggested openly and subtly that: Lin Xi was the one who pushed her into the lake but she was a very forgiving person and would not hold a grudge against Lin Xi.Sure enough, as soon as Lin Anxin had said that, the atmosphere became heavier around the dinner table.Xu Jiaofeng smacked her chopsticks down on the bowl and scolded, \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t blame her for it? You don\u2019t need to defend her when she was the one at fault!\u201dHearing that, Lin Anxin shrank her neck back a bit and said docilely, \u201cI was wrong\u2026\u201dXu Jiaofeng\u2019s look turned tender all over again before she turned and looked at Lin Xi coldly.\u201cWe will turn over a new leaf this time since Xinxin had already forgiven you. It would not be so easy next time. The Lin\u2019s family do not have evil people like that.\u201dLin Xi kept her eyes lowered and continued to eat what was inside of her bowl. She remained silent \u2013 it wasn\u2019t that Lin Anxin was a good actor or good at making up excuses. It was simply that the others refused to believe in Lin Xi. As such, there was no point in saying anything else.Probably because some major event was about to take place, Xu Jiaofeng was much \u201cnicer\u201d to her today.Zhong Cui chimed in at this point, \u201cRight, right, right. Something like this could not happen again.\u201dObviously Zhong Cui wasn\u2019t done talking yet.The fact that she was there right now meant there was more.Lin Xi looked at Zhong Cui expressionlessly, waiting for her show to begin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Here, have some meat.\u201dPausing a little, Zhang Cui added, \u201cI plan to pay the village that I came from a visit. Xiao Xi, you have never been, right? Come with me this time. You can even stay there for a little while.\u201dHere it comes.Thought Lin Xi to herself. She had another mouthful of rice without giving herself away. Looking at Zhang Cui, she put on a baffled look, \u201cWhy do you want me to go visit there with you out of the blue?\u201d\u201cWell, you have nothing else going on, no?\u201dLin Xi shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201dHearing the determined tone in Lin Xi\u2019s voice, Zhang Cui knew that she would need a little bit more in order to convince her. She faked a sigh, then told \u201cthe truth\u201d. \u201cWell, we are doing this for your own good. After what had happened to Xinxin and you at school, others will gossip when you go back to school. There might even be disciplinary action from the school. What if they want you to turn in reports stating that you are sorry or even add a demerit onto your record?\u201cAs such, you come with grandma and stay in the village for a little while. We will have you back after the incident dies down a bit.\u201dLike heck I\u2019d believe you.Lin Xi rebutted her in her mind.Then there was Lin Anxin. Had she no idea the real reason she had fallen into the pond? And now she was nodding along as Zhang Cui talked and looked at her with worries?At this moment, even Song Kexin, who rarely spoke to Lin Xi, chimed in, \u201cYour randmother only has your best interest in mind.\u201dZhang Cui nodded anxiously, \u201cExactly. Things aren\u2019t half bad in the village nowadays. Besides, it\u2019s only temporary. It\u2019s not like you will be staying there forever.\u201dLin Xi still have resentment on her, \u201cWhat about school then?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. There\u2019s school in the village too.\u201d Zhang Cui paused for a little, then added, \u201cYour mother even graduated from there in the past.\u201dSeeing that Lin Xi had remained silent and lowered her head as though she had accepted the suggestion wordlessly, Zhang Cui\u2019s smile grew and she said with a kindly look, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s set then. You can pack up after breakfast and then we will head out.\u201dXu Jiaofeng took a sip of the soup and said, \u201cHaving Uncle Li take you.\u201d\u201cSure. Thank you, in-law,\u201d said Zhang Cui as she gave Xu Jiaofeng an appreciative smile.Lin Xi watched the interaction between the others and snickered: They have had it all planned out already. What was the point in asking her for her opinion symbolically?Lin Xi knew that her objection would be ignored and gave up fighting any further.Poking at the rice with the chopsticks in her hand, she hesitated a little and said, \u201cMy classmate has a few of my notebooks. I need to get them back if we are taking off.\u201dXu Jiaofeng didn\u2019t like that idea. With a disgruntled look, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s just some silly notebooks. You can buy them after you have arrived there.\u201d\u201cMy notes are in them.\u201dXu Jiaofeng was about to say something else but, noticing that Song Kexin was gesturing her with her eyes, she finally stopped talking unhappily. She was not happy about it: All they wanted to do was to send a child away. What\u2019s with all the hassles?The few exchanged a look and Xu Jiaofeng said, \u201cAlright then. We\u2019ll take off tomorrow.\u201cBut early tomorrow morning. We can\u2019t wait any longer. We don\u2019t want to hold your grandmother back.\u201d-- Xu Jiaofeng looked down on Zhang Cui. Naturally, she would not have her best interest I mind. She obviously just wished for her to leave as soon as possible.Lin Xi wanted to laugh but said nothing else. She buried her face in the bowl and nodded. She started her own plan in her head.***As she needed to go to pick up her notebooks at school. Lin Xi went to school with Lin Anxin in the car after breakfast.In the car, Lin Anxin looked over at Lin Xi, hesitated a little bit, and finally said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Big Sister. It was so hectic yesterday. I had no idea how I fell into the water. I did say that to Mom and Grandma, but they wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201dLin Xi turned her head. She had better things to do than paying attention to Lin Anxin.Seeing that, disgruntlement and discontent flashed past Lin Anxin\u2019s eyes. She thought about it some and carried on, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that Grandma would bring you over to the village. I\u2019ve heard that the living conditions there are quite poor. Perhaps I can talk Grandma out of taking you there.\u201dLin Anxin seemed to be aggravating Lin Xi on purpose. Lo and behold, her words were like punching at cotton. Lin Xi did not pay her any attention at all.Feeling defeated, Lin Anxin looked away disappointedly.The two did not exchange any more words on their way to school.Once they have arrived at school, the two of them got out of the car and went to their respective classrooms.Because of what had happened the day before, Lin Anxin had two bodyguards entering the school with her. Thanks to Lin Anxin, Lin Xi, too, have one bodyguard following behind her.Naturally, that bodyguard\u2019s job was not to protect her, but to monitor her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She packed up past examinations inside of her desk and the textbooks in the back storage area.\u201cHave you guys heard about what happened to Lin Anxin?\u201dHearing a familiar name suddenly, Lin Xi stopped what she was doing for a second. Then she heard the few girls in the corners seemed to be talking about what had happened with Lin Anxin yesterday.\u201cWho\u2019s Lin Anxin? The freshman year class flower.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s her.\u201d\u201cWhat about her?\u201d asked another girl dubiously.\u201cWhat? You haven\u2019t heard? She was cornered by Yan Xuequi and her underlings by the artificial pool yesterday. She even fell into the pool afterward. So many were there who had witnessed that.\u201d\u201cThat dramatic?\u201d The girl who was baffled earlier continued to ask, \u201cWhat happened? How did she end up offending Yan Xueqi and the others?\u201d\u201cYeah. What was wrong with that Lin Anxin to want to offend Yan Xueqi.\u201d Another girl, too, was baffled.Yan Xueqi and her underlings were the hooligans at school. It was said that she had quite a family background and most would not want to cross them under normal situations.\u201cYou know Wang Yukai in Class C?\u201d\u201cYeah, childhood friend of Yan Xueqi. It\u2019s not a love triangle, is it?\u201d\u201cOh, better than that.\u201d The girl paused, then went on. \u201cI don\u2019t think Lin Anxin is into Wang Yukai but she didn\u2019t turn him down when he professed his love for her or give her gifts. However, when he asked her for her WeChat, she purposefully gave him her best friend\u2019s WeChat contact information instead. And she even lied to her friend that Wang Yukai was into her.\u201d\u201cOh, my lord! You can do that? So her best friend was under the impression that Wang Yukai was going after her the entire time while Wang Yukai thought he was pursuing Lin Anxin? Oh, mi. What did she do that for? I didn\u2019t know players outsource nowadays.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not done yet. Whenever Lin Anxin receives gifts from Wang Yukai, she\u2019d turn around and give it to her best friend and said that Wang Yukai asked her to be the middle person. Guess what happened then? Yan Xueqi happened to witness the whole transaction.\u201d\u201cWhat a melon. No wonder Yan Xueqi had beef with her. But how did you find out about it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you read the forum? Yan Xueqi posted it all to the forum.\u201d\u201cOh, really? Let me look.\u201d The girl pulled out her cellphone and quickly scrolled through the forum. \u201cWait, I think you get it backward.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cSee for yourself. Lin Anxin\u2019s friend posted this. She said that she had talked to Lin Anxin and Lin Anxin was baffled as well. She had always thought that Wang Yukai was into her friend and only having her as the middle person.\u201d\u201cNo way. That\u2019s so fake. Who\u2019d buy that?\u201d\u201cWell, many. Look. Many are supportive of Lin Anxin. Look here and here. Some even said she is silly cute.\u201d***So that\u2019s what it was.The corners of Lin Xi\u2019s lips twitched when she heard their conversation. Finding out the backstory about the incident two days ago, she was stunned by Lin Anxin\u2019s actions and that left her speechless.Gossips were all over the school. All Xu Jiaofeng and the others needed to do were to pay a trip to the school and found out that she had nothing to do with Lin Anxin falling into the other. Nevertheless, they chose to listen to Lin Anxin\u2019s lies instead. Or, they didn\u2019t, but they chose to side with her anyway.***The girls were still gossiping about it when, one of the girls seemed to have noticed Lin Xi. She gestured with her lips and stopped the other girl from talking.\u201cLet\u2019s go talk somewhere else.\u201d She said that in a low voice as she pointed at Lin Xi\u2019s direction to the others.All of them had the same look as the first girl when they saw Lin Xi.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go. We will talk about it over there.\u201d The few walked away quickly, as though Lin Xi was some sort of contagious disease.Lin Xi had long since numbed by situations like this.When Lin Xi first started school, she got along with everybody just fine and had a few close friends. Starting last semester, however, a lot of malicious rumors about Lin Xi started appearing in the school\u2019s forum: Some said she was staying at a family that was not hers; some said she was the child of murders; other said she was child of a r*pist, and that she only did well in school because she cheated on all of her examinations. Some even more ridiculous ones said she had improper relationship with the 50-60 year old man in the school\u2019s print shop, which was why she had access to the examinations ahead of time, which explained her good grades.All of them were ridiculous but some believed them nonetheless.Her friends started keeping their distances from her and the others started avoiding her.The school did, in the end, stood up and clarified that the rumors were untrue and also had the negative rumors removed. Nevertheless, the negative impact from the rumors had already been done.What was even more ridiculous was: The school had announced one day that they were going to get down to the bottom of this and find the person behind these rumors and deal with them severely but everything seemed to have been forgotten by the next day and was never mentioned again.Lin Xi let out a sighed and hurried up in her shoving her textbooks into her backpack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were, indeed, a few pens that she had left there as backup. Lin Xi quickly put those inside of her backpack and, at the same time, grabbed a few additional electronic components and wires that they had been using for their experiment from the drawer.There were these consumable accessories in almost every drawer but Lin Xi didn\u2019t need too many of them.She visited the teacher\u2019s lounge next.Song Kexin had already taken a stretch of time off for Lin Xi; as such, Lin Xi only had to talk to them quickly before they let her walked out of the school early.***Lin Xi stopped the chauffeur when they drove past a shop.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Miss?\u201d\u201cI need to go buy some stuff that I need to bring with me.\u201dThe chauffeur thought about it for a little bit and pulled over. Lin Xi walked inside the shop, grabbed what she needed, and also grabbed some snacks to mix in with them, before she returned to the car.***Once they have arrived home, Song Kexin called the bodyguard over to speak with him privately. She asked him, \u201cWe have called a long time ago, what took so long to come home?\u201dSong Kexin worried that Lin Xi would notice that something was off and refused to go.\u201cMadam, Miss stopped on the way to pick up some stuff from the shopping center.\u201d\u201cWhat did she buy?\u201d\u201cUSB battery pack, an electric fan, some skincare products, chips and other snacks. She also went over the pharmacy and got herself some insect repellent, cold medicines, antiseptic medications and\u2026 and a few stuffed animals.Hearing that from the bodyguard, Song Kexin\u2019s eyes flickered a little: Judging from what Lin Xi had purchased, she was getting ready to be staying for a while in the village.Song Kexin felt relieved now.\u201cOkay, I got it. You can go.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d***Lin Xi, on the other hand, had not left her room since she walked inside of it.Lin Xi, who had spent the entire time in her room, did not rouse any suspicion from the others.Inside of her room and in front of Lin Xi laid crude reflux device that she had made out of cans and jars that she was able to collect from the kitchen. After one last careful check up on them, Lin Xi quickly added crushed red peppers and alcohol in them and plugged the device in.The fluid began to boil shortly and continued the cycles of evaporation and re-solidifying.It was a long process.Lin Xi stared at it with her chin on her palm for a little while before she pulled out the USB battery pack and the electronic components and wires that she had hide in her backpack.With a screwdriver and a utility knife, she opened up the battery pack. The design inside was even simpler than Lin Xi had imagined.She studied it for a little while and was quickly able to locate the safety current limiting device. She snipped the cord to the safety device and removed the output end of the battery end.Lin Xi then took apart the few stuff animals that could make noise and, sure enough, found the magnets that she was looking for inside of their speakers.Using her calculation, Lin Xi wrapped some wire around the magnet a few times before connecting them.She was able to complete a minor transformer quickly.Lin Xi then connected the transformer to the output end of the battery back and tucked the ends of the two wires onto both sides of the USB\u2019s interphase end.Once she had finished with all these, she closed up the battery pack and brought it back to its original state.Pressing down the power switch of the battery pack, an electric current between the ends of the two wires could be seen with naked eyes.The electric current wasn\u2019t enough to kill someone, but it was enough to bring down an adult.Lin Xi smiled at her homemade \u201ctaser\u201d.She then looked over at the simple reflux device on the other side.Lin Xi replaced the iced sprite that had already turned warm with a can of iced cola, added more alcohol inside of it, and repeated her steps earlier.She repeated that four times before she was able to obtain a very small amount of concentrated hot pepper solution. It wasn\u2019t as pure as she had imagined and had a lot of impurities inside but it was the best she could do.Removing all of the complicated cans and jars, Lin Xi took a whiff and a pungent odor went straight to her head.\u201cThis should do.\u201dLin Xi wiped away the tears that was induced by the odor and waited until the solution cooled down before she carefully poured them into the pressurized spray bottle that she had purchased earlier from the shop.She looked at it left and right and finally placed the toner label from a free gift from the shop on the spray bottle.Perfect!Lin Xi packed the items into her bag.She hesitated for a little bit and finally took out her utility knife and scissors again.She cut a small opening at a subtle location on her backpack and shoved inside of it a few banknotes.She checked it multiple times and finally wrapped it up after she was certain that she had not missed anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was running as fast as she could and there were a lot of noises coming from behind her.Suddenly, she saw darkness in front of her eyes. She was caught.Falling onto the ground, Lin Xi pushed herself backward as much as she could but she was finally surrounded by the men in front of her against a wall.Lin Xi couldn\u2019t see their faces but she could feel that they all had a vicious look on them.They got close to her and grabbed her by her limbs. One of them kicked her a few times on her stomach, hard. Another one grabbed her by her hair and banged her head against the wall. She couldn\u2019t even begin to describe the pain that she was feeling.-- No! Someone, please help!Lin Xi wanted to scream but nothing was coming out of her.She could see many hands reaching toward to her.***The dream stopped abruptly at this point.\u201cNO---!\u201dLin Xi shouted and woke up from her nightmare.Lin Xi curled up under the blanket, her entire body was still shaking from the dream. She grabbed onto the blanket and pulled it around herself as tight as possible with her hands that were now numb.Lin Xi was pale and she was covered in cold sweat. The thick fear took over her for a long, long time \u2013 the final mortifying image replayed in her head over and over again. It was so real. So real that it did not seem like a dream at all.BANG BANG BANG. Came knocking noises from Lin Xi\u2019s room door.\u201cAre you awake, Miss? It is almost time to go. Madam said to have you go downstairs as soon as you are ready.\u201d It was Aunty Li\u2019s voice.\u201cAlright.\u201d***20 minutes, Lin Xi finished packing and went downstairs with her luggage.Seeing the huge suitcase behind Lin Xi, Zhang Cui asked in surprise. \u201cWhy are you bringing so much stuff with you? How much have you packed?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say I will be staying there for a while?\u201d Lin Xi answered her question with a question.Zhang Cui recollected herself immediately and nodded. \u201cAlright, alright. Bring as much as you want. We don\u2019t want you missing anything after you get there.\u201dPer their plans, they didn\u2019t just want Lin Xi to stay in the village for a few days, they planned to have her stayed there for years. So what if she wanted to bring additional stuff with her?Looking at Lin Xi\u2019s backpack, Song Kexin was anxious for some odd reasons. She said to the maid next to her, \u201cAunty Li, why don\u2019t you take a look through her stuff and see if she had missed anything.\u201dAunty Li acknowledged her request, walked up, took Lin Xi\u2019s backpack from her and inspected it.Most of the items inside of the backpack were clothing and textbooks along with some snacks. The remainders were a few bottles of travel size skincare products and the battery pack. There was nothing out of the ordinary. It was everything that one would pack when going on a trip.\u201cMadam, I think Miss has everything she will need.\u201dSong Kexin nodded and looked through it herself as well before she tried to put aside her bad feelings.\u201cOkay. You should head out now that you are all set.\u201dZhang Cui was about to take off with Lin Xi when Lin Yize came downstairs.The minute that Lin Xi saw him, she turned pale immediately, stumbled backward a few steps, and finally collapsed onto the couch.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Xiao Xi?\u201d Everybody looked over at Lin Xi. Evening Lin Yize gave her a cold look.\u201cI, I felt a little dizzy from hunger. Probably just low blood sugar,\u201d said Lin Xi, still pale.\u201cOh, dizziness from hunger is no big deal. I have some snacks with me that you can eat on our way.\u201d Having said that, Zhang Cui took a look at the time. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t dilly dally any longer. We might run into traffic. Let\u2019s go.\u201dLin Xi nodded and followed behind Zhang Cui into Uncle Li\u2019s car.After Lin Xi had gotten into the car, Zhang Cui took the opportunity to pat Song Kexin on her hand. \u201cWhat is it? Do you not want to part with her?\u201dSong Kexin shook her head and shared her concerns. \u201cMom, what if she escapes from the village after noticing that something was off?\u201dZhang Cui wasn\u2019t worried. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. She had no money on her, nor does she know the ways. How could she run? Besides, you know what our village is like. The closet bus stop was still over 10 km away. There is no running for her. The most she could do is to fuss over it for a little while once she realized it. I have already told Zhang Qiang to keep an eye out on her. She\u2019ll calm down over time.\u201dSee that her words had calmed Song Kexin down, Zhang Cui, too, got inside of the car.\u201cBye, Mom. Bye, Xiao Xi.\u201d Song Kexin waved at the both of them in the car.Lin Xi turned her head stiffly and tried her best to maintain her usual look. She, too, waved at the few others outside of the car but she dared not look at Lin Yize for too long.Lin Xi finally let out a sigh of relief after the car had pulled away.-- The dream from the night before appeared in Lin Xi\u2019s mind again.Immediately before the end of the dream, through all of the other shadows standing in front of her, she saw clearly the face of the man standing behind the others not too far from her.It was Lin Yize!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Striking back (1)The scene in her bizarre dream coincidentally overlapped with the scenes where \u201cshe\u201d was strangled to death by the gangsters in the extras of the novel.With the exception of the presence of Lin Yize.In the novel, \u201cLin Xi\u201d asked for it herself and the incident seemed to unbeknownst to Lin Yize.If that was the case, why did she see Lin Yize in her dream? He was smiling in her dream but on him was a look more vicious that she had ever seen.Fear crept back all over her again when she recalled the look on Lin Yize.***Over on one side, watching Lin Xi with her head twisted and staring straight out the window, her eyes couldn\u2019t open any wider, Zhang Cui felt her heart sank.She recalled her daughter\u2019s worries before they took off and she, too, became anxious reflexively.-- Lin Xi was a very smart child. She just might be able to memorize the way back.Zhang Cui\u2019s eyes rolled round and she said, \u201cXiao Xi, we are still hours away. Aren\u2019t you tired staring out the window like that? Maybe you should take a nap.\u201dLin Xi turned her head after she heard Zhang Cui\u2019s words and closed her eyes docilely.Zhang Cui gave a satisfactory smile when she saw that.What she didn\u2019t know what that Lin Xi didn\u2019t need to try to memorize the route \u2013 when she found out that they were going to take her to the village, she had already memorized the route between here and there, including certain specific spots like restaurant, rest areas, and motels.Then Lin Xi fell asleep for real.By the time they arrived at the Zhang Village and Lin Xi was woken up from the bumpy road, it was already noon time.Zhang Cui had the chauffeur drove all the way up to the front of Zhang Qiang\u2019s house.\u201cWe are here. Let\u2019s get out,\u201d said Zhang Cui.\u201cHere?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Seeing the dubious look on Lin Xi, Zhang Cui felt a guilty conscience all of a sudden. She laughed dryly and then went on to explain, \u201cThis is actually not one of the Zhang\u2019s properties. Our old house had been vacant for too long and was too old and dirty to be live in.\u201cThis is the house of a relative of ours. We will be staying here for a little while.\u201dLin Xi looked at the not so big house in front of them. The house hadn\u2019t been maintained in a long time and it was old and decrepit. It felt like it could \u201cdemolish\u201d itself at any given moment. There was another small house next to them. Half of its roof had already collapsed. There were garbage and other random items piled up in front of it. It was easy to tell that it was ancient.-- So this places wasn\u2019t old and dirty?Thought Lin Xi to herself. She seemed to have an idea now where Lin Anxin got her awful acting skills from.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Lin Xi as she followed Zhang Cui into the yard.As soon as they walked inside, they detected a scent so revolting that it could make one gag. It was a totally different smell from the those coming from the farmlands on their way there.At this moment, a topless man with messy hair and smelling like alcohol limbed out.\u201cAunty Cui, you are here.\u201dZhang Cui frowned when she saw the man in his current state but she didn\u2019t let that bother her for too long. She pulled Lin Xi in front of him and said, \u201cQiang-zi. It had been so many years. You look just how I remember you.\u201dHaving said that, she introduced Lin Xi to him officially. \u201cThis is Lin Xi, my granddaughter.\u201d\u201cXiao Xi, this is your Uncle Qiang. Call him Uncle Qiang.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dLin Xi\u2019s lips were taught. She didn\u2019t address him. She looked down and nodded expressionlessly.\u201cAunty Cui, your granddaughter seems a little shy,\u201d said Zhang Qiang.\u201cPerhaps because we have just arrived and she is still trying to familiarize herself,\u201d explained Zhang Cui.Zhang Qiang pursed his lips a little. \u201cYou need to be a little bit more outgoing to be loveable here.\u201dZhang Cui smiled dryly, \u201cShe\u2019ll get better over time.\u201dZhang Qiang lowered his head and took another look at Lin Xi. He didn\u2019t say anything else but showed Zhang Cui and Lin Xi into the house.Inside of the house smelled even more pungent than the outside.\u201cHave some water, Aunty Cui.\u201d Zhang Qiang placed two bowls of water in front of Zhang Cui and Lin Xi.Looking at the layer of brownish-yellow direct and the white, cotton-like particles that floated on top of the water. Tried as she might, Zhang Cui was not able to drink from that.It was fine when she was living there before. Now that she had lived in the city for a few years; she could no longer tolerate this.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not that thirsty.\u201d Zhang Cui declined him stiffly. \u201cPerhaps you can show us to our room so we can drop off our luggage first.\u201dZhang Qiang nodded and took Zhang Cui and Lin Xi into room next to them. The only thing between this room and the house outside was an old curtain.\u201cYou can stay here. The other rooms had stuff inside of them.\u201dHalf of this room, too, were cluttered with random stuff. There was a plank that was covered in dust and cobwebs. It was probably a bed.\u201cThis room is quite bright. It just needs a little cleaning.\u201d Nobody knew whether she was talking to Zhang Qiang or Lin Xi.As long as I don\u2019t feel awkward, then it will be someone else how feels awkward?Lin Xi didn\u2019t say anything.Zhang Qiang left with a bottle of alcohol and Zhang Cui started cleaning up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Striking back (2)After just a little while, Zhang Cui couldn\u2019t stand the dirtiness anymore. She took the opportunity when Lin Xi was outside and had Uncle Li helped get out the blankets and sheets from the trunk and put them on top of the bed board.It wasn\u2019t like the dust would bother her through the sheets.Once she was done tidying up, Zhang Cui pulled Lin Xi inside and said, \u201cYou can start unpacking now. I am going to say hi to a few of our relatives. I gathered that you are quite tired so you don\u2019t need to come with.\u201d-- Visiting relatives etc. was a lie. According to the novel, Zhang Cui wasn\u2019t able to locate Zhang Qiang so she gave the money to the \u201creferrer\u201d and returned to City B.Not that it mattered to Lin Xi whether Zhang Cui was going to stay around or not.After Zhang Cui had taken off, Lin Xi walked over to the bed and picked up her bag.The bag looked the same as before and didn\u2019t look touched. Lin Xi looked through it but did not find her cellphone.It wasn\u2019t difficult to figured out that it had been taken away by Zhang Cui.Luckily, Lin Xi had expected that and brought with her her old cellphone before they took off.She took a look at the time. It was still early and Zhang Qiang probably wouldn\u2019t be back for a little while longer. Lin Xi pulled out two energy bar and some water from her, ate them, and set up more preparations.***Sure enough, Zhang Cui never returned that night.Zhang Qiang, however, stumbled back. He had with him a new bottle of alcohol and a plastic bag with food he had taken with him from a buffet.Zhang Qiang picked up one of the two bowls from earlier, emptied out the water onto the ground, and put the bag inside of it.He placed it in front of Lin Xi and said, \u201cEat.\u201dLin Xi didn\u2019t move and Zhang Qiang didn\u2019t care either. He drank on his own while looking Lin Xi up and down.\u201cYou know how to cook and do laundry, right?\u201d He asked.Lin Xi didn\u2019t talk and Zhang Qiang went on, \u201cThis is not the city and you are not going to be doted. You need to learn what you don\u2019t know. I am not keeping you if you can\u2019t help out.\u201d\u201cEat this. Then pick up my clothes from my room and wash them. Get up earlier tomorrow to make breakfast. We don\u2019t have a lot of food at home. You walk out of this door, and pick whatever vegetables that you can find outside of other people\u2019s houses.\u201dListen to Zhang Qiang\u2019s matter of fact speech, Lin Xi kept her head lowered and remained silent. Her hands, inside her pockets, held on tightly to her maze and cellphone.Zhang Qiang looked at her for a while longer and asked, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201c14,\u201d replied Lin Xi.The girl\u2019s voice excited Zhang Qiang. His eyes rolled around. \u201cYou are not that young then. A few years back you would already have children of your own.\u201dSeeing that Lin Xi still didn\u2019t say anything, Zhang Qiang was displeased. \u201cYou are way too quiet.\u201d\u201cHere, come and drink with your uncle.\u201d Zhang Qiang dumped out the water in the other bowl and poured some alcohol in it. He pushed the bowl toward Lin Xi.When he had a good look of Lin Xi, his eyes lit up and a dirty look crossed his face.He hadn\u2019t expected that Zhang Cui\u2019s granddaughter was quite attractive. For sure she would feel better than those 10-yuan women at the end of the village. She was skinny but what\u2019s something different?An evil thought crossed Zhang Qiang\u2019s mind.Licking his lips, he sat over on the bench where Lin Xi was sitting. \u201cYou just stay here with your uncle here. Be docile and there will be food for you to eat.\u201dHaving said that, Zhang Qiang scooted closer to Lin Xi and started reaching one hand toward her.Lin Xi stood up abruptly, backed away and avoided Zhang Qiang.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dZhang Qiang was not pleased that Lin Xi dodged him. \u201cWhat am I doing? You are asking me what I am doing? How dare you avoided me? Watch me do you right now!\u201dHaving said that, he gave her a dirty look. \u201cI was the laughingstock because I can\u2019t find myself a wife. Lo and behold, Aunty Cui sent me one. I am going to try you out today.\u201d\u201cYou--! What are you talking about?! My grandma said I am just going to be staying here temporarily! I am warning you. Don\u2019t try anything!\u201dZhang Qiang had no idea that she was just trying to get information out of him. Snickered, he said, \u201cStay here temporarily? Hah! Aunty Cui sent you over for me to raise you like my own child. You will be staying here your entire life!\u201dHaving said that, he grumbled again. \u201cHrm. I would have given it more thought if she was to send me a son. What is a daughter good for? You are better off as my wife.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! My grandma told me that I am here temporarily.\u201d\u201cHrm. Hrm. She lied to you. But, no difference. You were given to me and I can do with you as I please!\u201d Having said that, Zhang Qiang looked vicious and he threatened her, \u201cNow that you are in my house, there will be no escape. I suggest you to be docile. If you take good care of me, I\u2019ll feed you. If you don\u2019t do a good job, I will kill you.\u201dHaving said that, Zhang Qiang tried to lung at her again.\u201cYou! You stay away from me!\u201d\u201cHelp!\u201dLin Xi looked frightened but she saw it clearly in her mind.She looked the way she did to lower Zhang Qiang\u2019s guard. He would think that what a tiny girl like her could do other than letting him have his ways with her.Right when Zhang Qiang had Lin Xi cornered and was about to make a move, Lin Xi suddenly pulled out her bottle of pepper spray. Depressing the button, she aimed right at Zhang Qiang\u2019s eyes.\u201cOOOWWWW!!!!\u201d Zhang Qiang covered his eyes and screamed.Lin Xi took the opportunity to dash sideway and avoided the spot where Zhang Qiang could reach her.She stared at Zhang Qiang with alert for a few seconds and, while he was rolling on the floor in pain, pulled her homemade taser, depressed the on/off switch, and pressed it against his neck.Zhang Qiang\u2019s body twitched with his shouts.Lin Xi waited until Zhang Qiang\u2019s body stopped twitching, zapped him a few more times before she finally stopped.Looking at the listless Zhang Qiang lying on the ground, \u201cOld psychopath,\u201d said Lin Xi and she kicked him a few more times.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - She was thinking about how to tell him that he had a daughter her age. (1)When Zhang Qiang slowly regained his consciousness, he discovered that he was hung up on the door frame. There were no ropes on him, just two benches.He had no idea how Lin Xi was able to do it but both of his arms where stuck inside the benches. He could bend them, retract them, thrust them forward, or pull them backward. If he only tried to move them just a little, his back and shoulder was painful like his arms were about to be ripped off.With his upper body controlled, he wasn\u2019t able to run away.Lin Xi walked in front of him.Zhang Qiang started shouting immediately. \u201cHow dare you tie me up like this. I am going to kill you\u2026\u201dLin Xi looked at Zhang Qiang coldly and snickered, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t get the chance to kill me.\u201dLin Xi pulled out her cellphone and played a recording to him. The recording started when he was about to take advantage to him and stopped when she shouted out for help.She purposefully stopped recording where she did as that was the most convincing part of it all.\u201cSo what? Zhang Cui had given you to me. I can do with you whatever I please. Nobody could tell me otherwise!\u201d Zhang Qiang wasn\u2019t worried about it.Lin Xi pursed her lips. \u201cNobody can tell you otherwise? Are you not familiar with the law at all? Let me tell you something. If I turn this recording in to the cops, they will execute you. Do you understand execution?\u201dZhang Qiang\u2019s eyes widened upon hearing that. \u201cYou, you are bluffing! You only get executed for murder. I was only going to r*pe you. I won\u2019t be executed for that!\u201d\u201cI see. You know nothing about contemporary law. So you don\u2019t believe, right? Alright, let\u2019s get down to the bottom of it.\u201d Having said that, Lin Xi went over to the yard.\u201cWhere the * are you going? Let go of me!\u201dLin Xi ignored Zhang Qiang and kept on walking.She had taken her suitcase outside earlier. She pulled out her literature textbook and walked back in front of Zhang Qiang. Pointing at the two characters that said \u201cLiterature\u201d, she said to him, \u201cDo you see this? Penal code.\u201d\u201cPe..penal code?\u201d Zhang Qiang was taken aback. He was an uneducated person, but he had at least heard of the penal code.\u201cWhy do you have that with you?\u201d\u201cOh, I also have with me the Constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Minors, Military Science and Technology, and Bio Science. Would you like to see them?\u201d Lin Xi rolled her eyes as she said it.Having said that, she pretended that she was flipping through it and stopped at a random page that didn\u2019t have illustrations on it. She turned the page to Zhang Qiang, pointed at one of the exercises, and said to him, \u201cLook. It said it right here. Any offender who forces a victim into unconsented s*xual relationship or had the intention of committing such act constitutes a crime. They will be sentenced to death or suspended for execution.\u201d\u201cFor, for real I\u2019ll be sentenced to death?\u201d Zhang Qiang was so worried that he started shuddering.\u201cI, I don\u2019t believe it. You are lying\u2026\u201dLin Xi was bluffing him. She could tell from the fact that the couplets from who knew how many years ago that had all sort of cuss words written all over it by naughty kids that were still left on the door that Zhang Qiang was an illiterate who knew nothing about the law.\u201cTsk. It\u2019s printed on paper right here. Why do I need to lie to you?\u201d Lin Xi paused and said, \u201cI will take the recording to the police station first thing tomorrow morning. You just wait to be arrested.\u201dLin Xi\u2019s serious look and determined tone stunned Zhang Qiang.\u201cBut, but nothing actually happened to you.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you see what was written? The intention of committing such a crime counts as well.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Zhang Qiangs\u2019s legs started to shake and he began to grovel. \u201cGirl, it was uncle\u2019s fault, alright? I shouldn\u2019t have such an awful idea. Uncle will change. Okay? Uncle will change, I promise. Please don\u2019t report me to the police. I\u2019ll give you good food and drinks in the future, alright?\u201dThis place was backward and Zhang Qiang had never left the village or attended school. He was uneducated and it didn\u2019t take much to intimidate him. All he wanted was to stay alive right now. Not that his life was all that, but it still beat being dead.Lin Xi stared at Zhang Qiang for a little while, as though she was contemplating, and finally said, \u201cOkay, I can not report you, but I am not going to stay at this awful place.\u201d\u201cSure, sure, sure. You don\u2019t have to live here.\u201d There was nothing that Zhang Qiang wanted more than for her to leave right now. He had expected her to be someone that he could push around and bully. She was way mightier than he had expected. In fact, she was like a disaster to him. He had no idea what it was that she had sprayed his eyes with and his face was still stinging right now.\u201cI\u2019ll go look for my own place to stay,\u201d said Lin Xi.\u201cSure, sure.\u201d Zhang Qiang would agree to whatever she says right now.Seeing that Lin Xi had no more follow ups, Zhang Qiang asked tentatively, \u201cThen\u2026 about that recording?\u201d\u201cI am keeping the recording, just in case you want to retaliate me.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019d you worry about? It\u2019s fine as long as I don\u2019t say anything. But you can\u2019t blame me if you have a big mouth and spread the words to others and the cops caught wind about it and came asking me for details.\u201d\u201cNo, no, of course not.\u201d Why would he do that to himself?\u201cCan you let me go now?\u201d He dared not move anymore. Any move would bring about great pain to him.Lin Xi ignored Zhang Qiang and went back to the yard. She pulled some snacks out of her backpack and ate them. Looking at the recording in her cellphone, Lin Xi pondered over it a little and renamed it to \u201cevidence\u201d.This evidence wasn\u2019t only directed against Zhang Qiang; it was also against Zhang Cui and the others. If they objected to her leaving that family in the future, this recording would be the best evidence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - She was thinking about how to tell him that he had a daughter her age. (2)Zhang Qiang\u2019s house smelled too pungent and Lin Xi did not want to go back inside. It was already darked outside and she had nowhere to go. Lin Xi stayed inside of Zhang Qiang\u2019s yard until 3 or 4 AM. When it was about daybreak, she picked up her backpack and took off.It was not her idea to stay at this godawful place for so long. She had booked a ride ahead of time but, this place was so remote that nobody would come. Early in the morning was the earliest time that she was able to book.Zhang Qiang was still hanging from the doorframe and he was either asleep or passed out. One way or another, he had no idea that Lin Xi had already taken off.***It was only after Lin Xi had taken off and it was bright outside when some villagers saw that the door into the courtyard of Zhang Qiang\u2019s place was wide open and there it was, Zhang Qiang, hanging by the doorframe.Many came in a very short while and all of them looked Zhang Qiang up and down incredulously.\u201cHow did you do this Zhang Qiang? How did you get yourself stuck like this when moving the benches out?\u201d\u201cI,\u201d Zhang Qiang, not daring to say that this was Lin Xi\u2019s handy work, could on muddle through it by saying, \u201cHad no idea. It just happened, okay?\u201dHis words brought a round of laughter from those who had gathered around.It took a few strong men to break the legs of the benches in order to free Zhang Qiang.An older woman stuck her head over at this point and peeked inside his house. She asked curiously, \u201cDidn\u2019t Zhang Cui said she dropped off a child who is a distant relative yesterday? Where is she now?\u201dHe dared not say that Lin Xi had already taken off. What if these people asked him why she left? These villagers had big mouths. Words would get distorted over time. What if the cops went to look for Lin Xi and she gave them the recording? He would be done for.Zhang Qiang had no idea what to say so he just made something up. \u201cShe fussed too much so I locked her up in a room.\u201dThe older woman nodded. She didn\u2019t find anything was wrong with that: Other families had sent over children to stay in the village in the past and they always wanted to run off at the beginning. It was common to lock them up at the beginning. They would quiet down after a while.\u201cZhang Cui had paid you. Don\u2019t forget to feed the child.\u201d The older woman took off with the others after giving him the reminder.***On the other side, at the same time, Lin Xi had already walked for 1.5 hour toward the entrance of the village.She squatted there for half an hour before she saw a white car with a City B license plate driving up to her.In the car, the driver saw a scrawny little body squatting at the entrance of the village all by her lonesome. There was nobody else next to her.Stopping in front of Lin Xi, the driver was surprised, \u201cJust you?\u201d\u201cYes, just me.\u201d Lin Xi nodded. Her lips curved upward and she said to him, \u201cI am going to look for my father. He lives in City B.\u201dLin Xi felt that this whole idea about a novel was still somewhat metaphysical and then there was that boss father that she had never met before\u2026As such, even though the idea of going to look for Gu Shao had crossed her mind at the beginning, she never gave it too much thought.That was, until the day when she overheard the conversation between Song Kexin and Zhang Cui and remembering the darkness of what happened to \u201cher\u201d in the novel after she was sent to the village. Lin Xi finally made a bold decision \u2013 she would go look for her own father.As such, even though Lin Xi didn\u2019t bring with her much that was valuable, she brought with her those that were important to her.***In the car, the driver had a look of understanding after he heard Lin Xi\u2019s explanation. It was commonplace in villages like this that the parents would go out to work elsewhere, leaving the children back home with the elderlies. The children would then go and rejoin them when they reached school age.\u201cYour parents didn\u2019t even come to pick you up? They just have you go alone?\u201d The driver grumbled as he got out and helped Lin Xi load her bag into the car. He then confirmed the location with Lin Xi. \u201cYou are heading to 77 Chongshan Street\u2026\u201dHaving said that, the driver looked surprised all of a sudden. \u201cYou are heading to NTN Technology Center? Your father works there?\u201dNTN Technology Center was a big enterprise and very well known. Even an on-demand driver like him had heard of it.\u201cMmm,\u201d said Lin Xi. He was the boss so that counted working there as well.\u201cHe must make good money working there,\u201d sighed the driver. Rumors had it that even the cleaning personnel there made more money than those at other companies.Lin Xi smiled. \u201cYes, my dad is very mighty.\u201d Mighty did not begin to describe him. Whether it was in the novel or in real life, Gu Shao was the boss of all bosses.The thought of being able to meet him soon made her feel surreal.The driver didn\u2019t pay too much attention to her \u201cmighty\u201d comment.On their way, the driver saw Lin Xi grabbed onto the seat belt with a very serious look on her. Sometimes she\u2019d frown and sometimes she\u2019d rub her head. Thinking that she might not be feeling well, he asked her, concerned, \u201cAre you getting car sick? Would you like me to slow down?\u201dLin Xi recollected herself and shook her head. \u201cNo, I am fine. You don\u2019t need to slow down.\u201d She was thinking about how should she explain their relationship to Gu Shao when she saw him and how to convinced him of the fact that he had a daughter her age.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Boss Gu? Gu Shao? (2)Upon hearing that, the receptionist\u2019s eyes flickered a little and there was surprise in her look.Lin Xi went on to say, \u201cI came all the way from Zhang Village just to thank him in person.\u201dAs she spoke, she pulled out her report card from this month\u2019s monthly examinations and showed it to the receptionist.The report card was very crumbled up and making Lin Xi looked as pitiful as it was.Lin Xi didn\u2019t make it that way on purpose. Her report card was inside her pocket when she jumped into the artificial lake to help Lin Anxin out. This was how it ended after it had gotten wet.The school\u2019s name was not listed on the report card. Just its emblem on the upper right-hand corner. Luckily, given her age, the little big sister receptionist would not have paid too much attention to any middle or grade schools and did not recognize the emblem of a noble school.The receptionist looked at the report card \u2013 her #1 rank stood out quite a bit as was the individual grades for each subject.\u201cSo, you wanted to show your report card to Boss Gu, is that it?\u201d asked the receptionist.Lin Xi nodded.Lin Xi was dirty and her hair was messy right now. She looked a lot like a student living in poverty.Looking again at the pitiful Lin Xi, her look was very sincere. The little big sister receptionist was a little moved.-- She didn\u2019t know for a fact whether Boss Gu had sponsored students in poverty before but Lin Xi definitely did not look like she was lying and what she had said was also quite convincing.She was a very nice and grateful girl!That was the receptionist opinion on her and she was touched by Lin Xi\u2019s acts.\u201cOkay. Take a seat right here and I\u2019ll schedule a time for you,\u201d said the receptionist as she smiled at Lin Xi in a friendly manner. This was a much different smile than her professional one from a while ago.The receptionist placed a call to the CEO\u2019s office and briefly explained the situation, along with some personal comments.***The respond came back quickly.The receptionist brought Lin Xi through the security check point and walked into the elevator lobby. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve made you an appointment. Go up from here. The elevator will take you directly to 27th floor. Then someone else will meet you there.\u201d\u201cThank you, big sister.\u201d Lin Xi gave the receptionist a sincere and grateful smile.Hearing the \u201cbig sister\u201d from Lin Xi made the receptionist very happy. She was only 26 years old and kids nowadays had already started referring to her as \u201caunty\u201d! How awful was that!Watching Lin Xi walked inside of the elevator, the receptionist contemplated notifying reporters. This was, after all, a touching moments and words of it should get out there.***27thfloor. Gu Shao was still in a meeting and Lin Xi was taken to a small conference room by the worker who met up with her.Lin Xi waited quietly in the conference room.Gu Shao\u2019s assistant Xu Fei walked inside and gave Lin Xi a curious look.\u201cSo you are the student in po.. er, that Boss Gu had sponsored?\u201d asked Xu Fie as he purposefully avoided the word \u201cpoverty\u201d.Lin Xi grunted vaguely instead of replying to his question directly. Not really\u2026Looking at the young girl who was sitting there with her back straight, Xu Fei felt incredulous. He had not expected that his boss, who seemed to be a cold-blooded person normally, had sponsored some student in poverty.Seeming to have noticed Lin Xi\u2019s nervousness and tension, Xu Fie cleared his throat and asked, \u201cWould you like some water?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Lin Xi. Followed by, \u201cThank you.\u201dXu Fie had someone brought over a glass of water. Lin Xi took it with both hands and took a few sips from it.The awkwardness returned to the conference room again.Lin Xi was dazed while looking at a certain spot in the conference room.Xu Fei looked over at where Lin Xi was looking at. It was a design schematic of a T-NM chip.Xu Fei raised his brows and, for the sake of making conversation, asked casually, \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201dHe only said it casually and hadn\u2019t really expected Lin Xi to know that.Lin Xi nodded seriously.\u201cThis is the design schematic of the T-NM chip, am I right?\u201d\u201cYou know that?\u201d Xu Fei was very surprised that Lin Xi was able to name it. There was no caption on the display at all.Lin Xi carried on and said, \u201cI do. Through the \u2018n+2\u2019 high speed NS piece circular double guiding system, the speed of the T-type chip had been increased by 60 folds.\u201cIn addition,\u201d Lin Xi paused for a little and carried on, \u201cThe size of the T-NM chip had also shrank significantly from the 0.8 to 1.2 cm2 of a regular T-type chip to as small as 0.05 cm2 of a T-NM chip.\u201dLin Xi\u2019s eyes were beaming when she talked.-- She was correct on all the details.Xu Fei\u2019s jaw almost dropped to the ground.\u201cHow did you know all these?\u201d asked Xu Fei. Not even a college student in this specific major might know the details of these cutting-edge technology.\u201cI\u2019ve read about it in the past,\u201d said Lin Xi. \u201cIt was published in last June\u2019s digital journal Electronic Technology.\u201dXu Fei, \u201c!\u201d A valedictorian would always be a valedictorian.Xu Fei, \u201cAye, what grade are you in?\u201dLin Xi, \u201cI\u2019m a sophomore in junior high school.\u201dXu Fei, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d And where was he in his sophomore year in junior high school? He was still memorizing the 3-4-5 method.\u201cAre you interested in the area of electronic technology?\u201d ask Xu Fei as though something had just occurred to him. His eyes beaming, as though he had just found a good candidate.Lin Xi parted her lips and was just about to answer his question when Xu Fei stood up all of a sudden and looked past her toward the entrance of the conference room.\u201cBoss Gu.\u201d\u201c!\u201dBoss Gu? Gu Shao?!Lin Xi was taken aback a little a little, bounced up quickly from where she was sitting, and turned to look behind her.___Translator\u2019s rambling:* Refreshing is that this was not a crazy [rude] receptionist that yelled at our MC, which would subsequently lead to some brain dead faceslapping. =D* 3-4-5 method \u2013 this translator is no valedictorian but I think I did decent in mathematics\u2026 NEVER HEARD OF THIS 3-4-5 method till I googled it today!

    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - \u201cWhat do you want to do with the child?\u201d (1)As soon as Lin Xi turned her head, she saw a man walked into the small conference room.He was very tall. Much taller than he looked in his pictures in the articles and much taller than Lin Xi had imagined.He looked very young as well. Lin Xi remembered she had read that Gu Shao was just 37 years old this year.Gu Shao looked cold but it was a different kind of cold than the creepy coldness coming from Lin Yize. The coldness from this man standing in front of her resembled more the kind coming from someone of a high status. He exuded cold and domineering aura.As though one only needed standing in front of him to want to lower one\u2019s head.Lin Xi, nevertheless, didn\u2019t do that. She cocked her head and looking at the man standing in front of her with very bright eyes. Her lips curved upward uncontrollably.-- She finally figured out why she looked more attractive than Lin Anxin.Lin Anxin looked like their mother and Song Kexin was not your typical beauty. She was more the cute and virtuous type from your ordinary family in your clich\u00e9 romance novel.It was apparent that Lin Xi got most of her looks from her father.And, meeting him in person allowed Lin Xi to see that Gu Shao\u2019s eyes were the same color as hers \u2013 a brown color that was lighter than most others.***Looking at the dirty child in front of him smiling foolishly at him, Gu Shao couldn't help but frowned a little. He tried to recall if he could recognize this child.There had been charitable activities at school in the past and Gu Shao had, indeed sponsored a few students in poverty.But the school took care of all the administrative work. Gu Shao had no idea who exactly did he sponsored.And how exactly did this child in front of him locate him?Did the school provide his information to her?Gu Shao parted his lips and was just about to ask.At this very moment, Lin Xi beat him to it. She took a step forward and said, \u201cDad!\u201dBAM!Came a loud noise.That was Xu Fei, losing his footing, slamming into the edge of the table.Xu Fei, \u201cEm\u2026.\u201d They were just sponsor and student recipient a little while ago. How did she refer to him as \u201cDad\u201d now?? That was not a funny at all.\u201cEm, little girl. This is our Boss Gu, who is also your sponsor. You can refer to him as Uncle Gu or Boss Gu.\u201d Xu Fei forced himself to say.Anything but \u201cDad\u201d. Their Boss Gu didn\u2019t even have a girlfriend. So how would he have a daughter her age. Granted, many netizens referred to their boss as \u201cDad\u201d, but that was all in jest. This little girl didn\u2019t think that was for real, did she?Xu Fei looked at Luo Xiu, then cautiously looked over at his boss.At the same time, Gu Shao, who somehow got promoted to the rank of \u201cDad\u201d after just one meeting, his lips also twitched.Gu Shao looked into Lin Xi\u2019s eyes but Lin Xi did not look again.After looking into each other\u2019s eyes for a few seconds, Gu Shao seemed to have noticed that this girl wasn\u2019t joking and finally said coldly, \u201cYou have the wrong person. I am not your father.\u201d\u201cBut you are my father.\u201d Lin Xi was insistent about it.Noticing that Gu Shao\u2019s look became even colder than before, Lin Xi\u2019s heart sank a little. She quickly went on to explain, \u201cYou really are my father. I am not lying. You had a relationship with a woman inadvertently 15 years ago. That woman became pregnant later on and gave birth to a girl and that is me!\u201cYou may not believe it or know that woman or maybe you didn\u2019t even remember the incident, but I am telling you the truth. You can look into it if you want. We can do a paternity test.\u201dAt this point in time, Xu Fei\u2019s eyes were widened and his jaw was about to hit the floor.15 years ago? Inadvertently? Relationship? Child? Doesn\u2019t remember?!He had always thought of his boss as an emotionless machine who knew of nothing other than work. He even suspected that his boss had \u201cissues\u201d in certain areas. Who would have thought that he had such \u201crich past\u201d 10 plus years ago? And, by the sounds of it, might even be a scum by every definition.Xu Fei felt that he had an alarming melon out of the blue. Suddenly, a chill went down his spine: Would his boss \u201cget rid\u201d of him now that he knew of his dark history?As such, was his best move right now to disappear instantly pretending that he hadn\u2019t heard a word?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - \u201cWhat do you want to do with your child?\u201d (2)Over on this side, seeing that Gu Shao had a surprised look that crossed his face and then returned back to his cold self and was difficult to read, Lin Xi became nervous. Biting on her lip, Lin Xi said to him, \u201cI am not here to blackmail you.\u201dBut, girl, your behavior right now certainly looks a lot like it\u2026Thought Xu Fei to himself.Gu Nian continued to look at Lin Xi coldly, \u201cSo what do you call this?\u201d\u201cI, I just hope that you can raise me.\u201d Having said that, Lin Xi quickly elaborated, \u201cIt won\u2019t be long. Just till I am of age.\u201cI won\u2019t spend money irresponsibly or cause any trouble. I am very easy to raise.\u201d Lin Xi\u2019s look was very sincere.She couldn\u2019t do much until she was of age and what happened to her in the novel would still happen to her if she stayed with her original family. Then there was also that strange dream. She found the part where Lin Yize appeared at the end very disturbing.She needed a guardian.Gu Shao didn\u2019t say a word. His calm look was enough to put a lot of pressure on anyone.Lin Xi was anxious. She asked tentatively, \u201cDo you not believe in what I am saying?\u201d\u201cHow much would you believe in the words of some random stranger who just popped out of nowhere?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d Err, not that much.Lin Xi grumbled to herself.She then heard Gu Shao went on to say, \u201cYou and I are not related nor do I have the obligation to raise you. As such, you can go now.\u201dGu Shao called the building security to take Lin Xi out.Lin Xi panicked all of a sudden and grabbed Gu Shao by his arm. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving!\u201dLooking at the child who hung onto him like a koala and her pair of dirty hands that were holding onto him, Gu Shao\u2019s brows furrowed deeply and a hint of resentment flashed through his eyes.Overlooking Gu Shao\u2019s look, Lin Xi refused to give up. \u201cI am begging you. Please just raise me till I am of age. I won\u2019t even spend any of your money and I will repay you in the future.\u201cI will take care of you when you grow old and be by your deathbed. I will hire you the best caretaker and buy you the bet plot for your grave\u2026\u201dGu Shao, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dXu Fei, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d Perhaps this girl wasn\u2019t here to scam his boss. She was here to drive him insane.That being said, their boss\u2019s patience toward this little girl had exceeded what he had seen in the past.The few security guards stood next to them in a daze, not certainly about what to do.***Suddenly, someone else pushed the door open and walked inside.This was Gu Shao\u2019s aide, Chen Zhiyang.\u201cProfessor, your ride to LAS Technical Forum in City N is ready. We can leeeeeeeave, um, anytime.\u201d Chen Zhiyang was taken aback by the scene inside of the conference room. He looked around, baffled, and saw Xu Fei gesturing him madly with his look.\u201cEm, let me go see if our documents for the technical forum is ready.\u201d Having said that, Chen Zhiyang backed out voluntarily and took the dazed security guards with him.\u201cLet go,\u201d said Gu Shao again. His voice cold like there was ice in it.Seeing that her \u201cdanger\u201d had disappeared, Lin Xi let go of Gu Shao and stood there docilely in front of him.\u201cName?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cLin Xi, no. My name is Gu Xin. \u2018Gu\u2019 as in \u2018Gu Shao\u2019, \u2018Xi\u2019 as in \u2018milkshake\u2019.\u201d She even gave Gu Shao a fawning smile as she spoke.Gu Shao, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d\u201cI have no child, nor do I plan on raising one.\u201d Having said that, Gu Shao took a look at the time and walked out of the conference room.***Xu Fei, standing to one side, suddenly remembered something when he saw that Gu Shao had left. He ran after him.\u201cBoss.\u201d\u201cFollow up on our projects while I am over in City N for the next couple of days. Call me if you have any questions,\u201d said Gu Shao.\u201cOkay. I will,\u201d said Xu Fei. He then asked again, \u201cWhat do you want to do with the child?\u201dXu Fei thought his boss would say to see her out, or call the cops. Lo and behold, Gu Shao pondered over it for a couple of seconds and said, \u201cKeep an eye out on her for now. I\u2019ll take care of her when I return.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d His boss meant for him to keep the child around for the next couple of days, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - \u201cWhat do you want to do with your child?\u201d (3)Xu Fei returned to the little conference room after Gu Shao had left.Lin Xi was still standing where she was a while ago. Her head lowered, her fingers twisted together, the disappointment on her was a stark contrast to her shamelessness from earlier.She looked pitiful.This girl was certainly suspicious looking. But she also didn\u2019t look like some technological spy sent from some special organization.Xu Fei walked over to her and asked her gently, \u201cDo you have family?\u201dSeeing that \u201cyour Boss Gu is my family\u201d was about to come out of Lin Xi the very next second, Xu Fei quickly emphasized, \u201cFamily other than Boss Gu. Where are they? Do you have their contact information? Or perhaps\u2026 the way to get in touch with your mother?\u201dXu Fei did not entire write off what Lin Xi had said. Especially when his boss had acted differently today\u2026Hearing that, Lin Xi didn\u2019t say anything. She merely shook her head with her mouth pinched shut tightly.Remembering what his boss had said, Xu Fei waved his hand and said, \u201cNevermind that. It\u2019s alright if you don\u2019t want to tell me. Follow me. Let me find you a place to stay for now.\u201d\u201cYou mean I can stay here?\u201d Lin Xi looked up, her eyes beaming.\u201cIt\u2019s just temporary.\u201dLin Xi conveniently ignored what Xu Fei said last. She bowed at Xu Fei with a big smile on her. \u201cThank you for your trouble.\u201d-- This girl was quite polite. She didn\u2019t seem like just any child off the street.Thought Xu Fei to himself.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here for now. I have some more work to take care of and I will be back at the end of the work day.\u201dLin Xi nodded. Stopping Xu Fei again, she asked, \u201cCan I use the bathroom?\u201dLin Xi noticed that her hands were a little dirty when she was holding onto Gu Shao\u2019s sleeve.\u201cSure.\u201d Not wanting her to roam around the place, Xu Fei had a female employee showed Lin Xi the bathroom.***After walking into the bathroom, Lin Xi walked in front of the mirror. She was shocked by her own disheveled look: She hair was tied up messily. If one was to look carefully, there were even some cobwebs on it. Her clothes were covered in dust and there were oil stains on her sleeve. And, her face\u2026 was indescribably dirty.All these happened when she was dodging Zhang Qiang. She had been so anxious the entire trip that she had forgotten about her own image.This was what she looked like when she met her real father for the first time?!No wonder he seemed so resentful toward her.Lin Xi covered up her face with her palms. She had been too rash\u2026***Inside the bathroom.Lin Xi cleaned her face, redid her hair, and pulled out a set of clean clothes from her luggage.When Lin Xi walked back out, she saw the surprise look on the female employee from earlier: This girl was surprisingly pretty! And, her look\u2026***Inside of the car heading over to the airport.Chen Zhiyang learned of the incident through Xu Fei on WeChat: Even if he had 10 brains, he would never have guessed that their boss would have a child that age coming out of nowhere.\u201cProfessor, about the incident. I mean the girl from earlier. Do you think we should contact the cops?\u201d asked Chen Zhiyang.If it was a plan to set them up, they need to be prepared as well.NTN, as the heart of electronic technology, was an important existence. Their professor himself was privy to much key technology and information. As such, many in the past few years had tried to approach the profession with the intention of stealing information.They should not rule out the possibility of one of those parties sending over an underage child just to lower his guard.Gu Shao didn\u2019t say anything.His finger that was drumming lightly on the armrest of the seat betrayed that he wasn\u2019t as indifferent as he seemed.-- There was a certain memory in Gu Shao\u2019s mind that he was hazy about.15 years ago, he was just Second Young Master Gu, the second son of Gu Qinghua and not Professor Gu as he was today and the CEO of NTN Technology Center.He was able to dodge his enemy\u2019s set up at a planned banquet but not entirely.Half conscious, his assistant had helped him into a room and he had intended to sleep it off. Something, however, happened that night.By the time Gu Shao woke up the next day, all of the evidences had been wiped clean and everything appeared normal.Gu Shao never thought about the incident again after he had taken care of those behind the plan.He couldn\u2019t be certain whether something else had happened that night. If someone else had entered into the room and had intimacy with him.He, however, did not rule out that possibility.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - They said she looks like him? (1)Chen Zhiyang\u2019s eyes widened when he saw Gu Shao sunk into deep thoughts. He seemed to have figured something out: Perhaps, much like Xu Fei had said, the professor really had some \u201cromantic past\u201d.\u201cProfessor, would you like to arrange for paternity test?\u201d Chen Zhiyang, doing this best to suppress the shock that he was experiencing, asked tentatively as he tried to maintain a normal look.Gu Shao didn\u2019t say a word but his look became more solemn.Ignoring Chen Zhiyang, Gu Shao pulled out his phone and placed a call.The other end picked up the call quickly.\u201cSir.\u201d The deep male voice from the other end of the phone was very respectful.\u201cGo look into a Gu Xi.\u201d Noticing that he had misspoke, Gu Shao paused and corrected himself. \u201cA girl around 13-14 years old by the name of Lin Xi.\u201cIn addition.\u201d Gu Nian looked down and added, \u201cLook into what happened in Imperial Court Hotel 15 years ago.\u201dThe man on the other end of the call did not ask too many questions. \u201cYes, Sir. I will arrange for that right away.\u201dGu Shao sunk into deep thoughts once again after hanging up on the call.This time, however, he wasn\u2019t trying to sort out his vague memory from 10+ years ago. Instead, he was thinking about the girl covered in dust whom he had just met 20 minutes ago.***The Lin\u2019s residence on the other end.Zhang Cui, after dropping Lin Xi off at Zhang Qiang\u2019s place, used visiting relatives as an excuse and had the chauffeur took her back.She stayed over at the Lin\u2019s place for another night and finally started packing to return to her own place after she had lunch.Before she took off and noticing that concerned look on her daughter, Zhang Cui spoke to her, \u201cKexin, are you still worried about it?\u201dSong Kexin nodded, then shook her head. \u201cMom, I just have a bad feeling about it. What did you tell Lin Xi when you left? Would she notice that something is off and run away from Zhang Qiang\u2019s place?\u201dZhang Cui patted Song Kexin on her hand and said, \u201cYou worry too much. Lin Xi had no money with her and she is not familiar with the area. I even stole her cellphone. Where do you think she can go?\u201cBesides, I\u2019ve specifically asked Zhang Daitian\u2019s wife to go take a look over at Zhang Qiang\u2019s place this morning.\u201d\u201cHow did that go?\u201d Song Kexin was nervous.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. She is still there. She made a fuss and Zhang Qiang locked her up.\u201dSong Kexin let out a sigh of relief but still frowned from feeling worried. \u201cI worry she would continue to fuss. Would negative words get out?\u201dIf the media got hold of this, it would negatively impact the Lin family\u2019s reputation for sure.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. News won\u2019t get out from there. Besides, she is just a child. It\u2019s only normal that she would fuss in a brand-new environment. She will get over it in a few days.\u201dSong Kexin felt better after hearing that from Zhang Cui. She nodded and said, \u201cWhen push comes to shove, we can always offer more money to Zhang Qiang and have him keep a closer eye out on Lin Xi.\u201dZhang Cui agreed with her. Her eyes rolled and something else had occurred to her. She pulled over Song Kexin\u2019s hand and said to her, \u201cI have an idea if you worry that Yize and your mother-in-law are bothered by that child.\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d asked Song Kexin.\u201cWe have already sent the child away. We might as well move her household register over to your second grandfather\u2019s family. That way she will have nothing else to do with the Lin family. Besides, your second grandfather\u2019s family has a lot of children. Nobody could tell when they gain or lose a child.\u201dThe regulations on household register had been tightened as of late, unless 10+ years ago. It would be hard press to add a child under Zhang Qiang\u2019s name when he was a single man. Second uncle was a relative of hers and it would not be difficult to move Lin Xi\u2019s household register over.Song Kexin frowned a little. \u201cHow would we explain it away on our end?\u201d\u201cI have thought of that as well. What I am thinking is that you can pick another child from second grandfather\u2019s place that is around the same age and raise her instead.\u201d Zhang Cui paused for a little and carried on talking, \u201cNobody knew what First Miss Lin looks like anyway. She would still be your older child after the swap.\u201cBut you can raise her as though she is a niece of yours. That way she wouldn\u2019t feel such envy.\u201cBesides, children from the villages are simple and honest. They won\u2019t be manipulative like Lin Xi and we won\u2019t need to worry about our Xin-er being bullied.\u201dSong Kexin understood where Zhang Cui was coming from but bringing over another child was a big deal. \u201cLet me talk to Yize and my mother-in-law about this first.\u201dZhang Cui nodded and got ready to take off.Song Kexin stopped her again. Looking anxious, she asked, \u201cMom, do you think Lin Xi will hate us?\u201dZhang Cui waved her hand, \u201cShe\u2019s just a child. She wouldn\u2019t think that much. She\u2019ll get used to living in Village Zhang in a few days.\u201dSong Kexin nodded and saw Zhang Cui out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - They said she looks like him? (2)On this end, Lin Xi still had no idea that after experiencing being sent away, even her household register was about to be moved out in a package deal.After she had changed into a set of clean clothes, Lin Xi returned to the little conference room and waited without worries.While waiting, Lin Xi pulled out a book from her backpack and started reading.It was very quiet in the conference room with nobody there to disturb her.Xu Fei, after taking care of a few documents and walking out of his office, overheard a few female employees chitchatting in a low voice in the break room of 27thfloor and the topic seemed to be surrounding between the girl and their boss.\u201cYou are kidding, right? You said the girl looks like our\u2026\u201d The female employee looked shocked and mouthed the word \u201cboss\u201d.\u201cI kid you not. They look a lot alike, especially the feeling that they give you.\u201d\u201cAura? What aura?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t really put my fingers on it. Styles, expressions, um, aura? They are just alike.\u201d\u201cSo, the girl is the boss\u2019s\u2026 um, you know?\u201d\u201cStop it! She could be a child from a relative\u2019s family too.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t she supposed to be some student that the boss has sponsored?\u201d\u2026\u2026Xu Fei cleared his throat and purposefully interrupted the conversation between the employees. The few were startled and quickly wrapped up their breaks and returned to their own desks.Xu Fei stood there feeling baffled. What did they say? That the child resembles their boss? How come he didn\u2019t notice it?Xu Fei went back into the conference room dubiously and saw Lin Xi, who had cleaned herself. Xu Fei\u2019s eyes widened immediately. This wasn\u2019t \u201csomewhat alike\u201d; this was very much alike!Seeing that Xu Fei had returned, Lin Xi put away her book and looked at him.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d are not really the boss\u2019s child, are you?\u201cYour name is Lin Xi?\u201dLin Xi nodded.\u201cYou must be hungry. There\u2019s a cafeteria here. Wait here, I\u2019ll bring you some food,\u201d said Xu Fei. He couldn\u2019t let his boss\u2019s child starve.***Xu Fei returned quickly with food.Lin Xi\u2019s lips twitched when she saw the pile of meats on her plate: What\u2019s with this sudden \u201chospitality\u201d?Taking the chopsticks from Xu Fei, something seemed to have occurred to Lin Xi. Looking at Xu Fei, she asked, \u201cIs my dad back yet? Do we need to get him some also?\u201dXu Fei, who was also eating, paused and then explained, \u201cOh, I forgot to mention. The boss will be at the symposium for the next two days. Going there and back will be another 2.5 days. So you will be staying here with me for the next couple of days.\u201dLin Xi nodded while biting down on the chopsticks.As the two ate, Xu Fei noticed that Lin Xi seemed to particularly enjoy the sweet and sour pork so he had another colleague brought over another big bowl for her from the cafeteria.Lin Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Is it murder if she dies from overeating?***After dinner, Lin Xi was taking to a building behind the NTN Technology Center.\u201cThis is the temporary housing area for the Center. We normally use it to host different scholar teams or as temporary housing for new employees,\u201d said Xu Fei. \u201cYou can stay here for the next couple of days. You can use the phone inside your room to contact the building management team directly if you need anything.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. It\u2019s very safe here.\u201cDon\u2019t do go running around either, okay?\u201dXu Fei, worried about Lin Xi, nagged some more before he took off.-- Xu Fei was quite fond of this valedictorian-like child who popped out of nowhere from the get go, especially it was looking more and more likely that she could be the boss\u2019s child.That being said, what had happened back then that would leave his boss with this child.Xu Fei couldn't help but wonder when he looked at Lin Xi.In a minute or less, Xu Fei had already come up with a whole Mary Sue drama of \u201cThe Domineering CEO Is in Love with Me\u201d and \u201cBeautiful Female Lead Ran off with Bun\u201d.\u201cXiao Xi, if you are coming to look for your father by yourself, then\u2026\u201d Where is your mom?All of a sudden, Xu Fei was very curious about this woman who had crossed path with their boss in the past.Nevertheless, one thought of what Lin Xi looked like when she presented herself, he stopped himself.-- She looked dirty and pitiful. Who knew where she came from and how far she had walked before arriving here? And what happened on her way and how much suffering she had to endure on her way. And she had ate so much during dinner. When was the last time she had any food in her?If her mother was still around and that her days were decent, how would she look the way that she did?Perhaps, her mother had already\u2026The possibility of that put a solemn look on Xu Fei. The more he thought about it, the more likely he thought that might be the case.Why else would this child show up out of the blue looking for their boss?Perhaps this child\u2019s mother could no longer raise her and that was why she had told her the truth and had her come looking for her father.With that thought, Xiao Xi was such a pitiful child.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(3)Xu Fei switched between lamenting and sighing on his face and Lin Xi was totally baffled, having no idea what was going through Xu Fei\u2019s mind.But, what\u2019s with that sudden sympathy coming from him?\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your dad will return soon.\u201d Xu Fei comforted her.Lin Xi nodded, still baffled.***After Xu Fei had taken off, Lin Xi walked inside the room and checked out this temporary apartment.The room wasn\u2019t very big, about the size of a normal hotel room but without the complicated d\u00e9cor. The entire room looked simple and warm.The bedsheets, the blankets, and other daily items had obviously been switched out to new ones before her arrival.Lin Xi put down her luggage and placed it on the floor. She then pulled out her remaining snacks and clothes from it, organized them, and placed them neatly into the drawers.Then it was the books and textbooks that were on the bottom.Lin Xi separated out the textbooks and other books and placed them on both sides of the desk.Lin Xi spaced out a little when she looked at the stack on the left-hand side.A few of the books on electronic technology was written by Gu Shao.Lin Xi smiled when she thought about her real father whom she met today.-- He looked a little mean and not too excited when he saw her but Lin Xi felt that Gu Shao was not a bad person. At the very minimum, he didn\u2019t seem as cunning and wicked as he was portrayed in the extras of the novel.Most likely he would not hit her or sell her off.She failed to show him her best side today\u2026Recalling the scene when they met today, Lin Xi felt embarrassed and couldn't help but buried her head into the pillow.She contemplated how to clarify herself when she met up with Gu Shao next time.***More time had passed and Lin Xi stood up, tidied up the bed that she had messed up, and walked over to the desk.There was an all-in-one computer sitting there. Lin Xi turned it on. It did not require a password She could use it and get online with it.Lin Xi dared not log into her own social media account. She didn\u2019t want her mother or grandmother to notice that something was off.Zhang Cui had taken away her cellphone when they were at Village Zhang. Prior to that, she had already deleted all the important history, including her app-based car reservation, but her SIM card was still in the phone.Lin Xi used a temporary account to log into a few websites and looked up recent competitions, including some for regular subjects and some innovative competitions.There were many competitions of these types in different scales. Lin Xi had competed in many of them in the past and was no stranger to them.Lin Xi marked down a few major ones or ones that offer high award amounts. She then visited some training facilities\u2019 and training institutions\u2019 websites and looked up their contact email addresses and application information.There would be award money when one won in these competitions. There would be an additional award amount if one entered the competition representing a training facility.Lin Xi knew about this because she had received invitations from some training facilities in the past.She created curricular vitae for herself with her grades and award history and sent them over to a few training facilities\u2019 mailboxes. She confirmed that everything was completed properly before she turned the computer off.All there was left to do was to wait.Lin Xi had thought it through: Regardless of whether Gu Shao would raise her, she did not want to return to the Lin family.In the novel, \u201cshe\u201d went offline right before she turned 18 years old and Lin Yize aimed for Gu Shao at around the same time.She could save up some money and support herself.If Gu Shao was willing to raise her, she would work even harder on making money. Should Gu Shao not be able to avoid the fate of going bankrupt by the hands of Lin Yize, perhaps she could make enough to support the both of them.***Gu Shao, way over in City N, had no idea that he had just made Lin Xi\u2019s list of \u201cthose I need to raise in the future\u201d.Gu Shao had just finished up a night conference.He received a call from Xu Fei as he walked out of the venue.\u201cBoss.\u201d\u201cThe responsible parties from Project STTR and Beacon visited the center today. As you were out of town, I had them leave behind the documents and have already forwarded them to your email. I have also forwarded to you the invitations for a few conferences\u2026\u201d Xu Fei reported to Gu Shao on work.Gu Shao acknowledged him after Xu Fei was done talking. \u201cOkay. I will take a look in a little bit.\u201d\u201cIn addition,\u201d Xu Fei carried on. \u201cOn the development of Ruiteng-11, the project team reported that the development of the chip was completed ahead of schedule and they are ready to present it. Would you like to move up the achievement exhibition that was set for end of the month?\u201d\u201cNo. Let\u2019s keep the original schedule,\u201d said Gu Shao.\u201cOkay,\u201d said Xu Fei.Xu Fei, \u201cThen there is\u2026\u201dGu Shao, \u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cBoss, your, um, I mean Xiao Xi, the girl from this afternoon, I have arranged for her to stay at our temporary housing.\u201dNot hearing anything back from Gu Shao, Xu Fei pondered over it for a little bit and finally, he couldn't help but, risking being \u201ctaken care of\u201d by his boss, said, \u201cBoss, Xiao Xi actually looks quite like you.\u201dHe believed in what he saw!\u201cAnd, over dinner tonight, she even asked about what time you will be back and even we should have some food set aside for you as well.\u201d Without realizing it, Xu Fei had already taken up the role of trying to ease the relationship between this father and daughter duo.Unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t been too successful.Listening to Xu Fei\u2019s words, Gu Shao frowned a little and acknowledged that he had heard him nonchalantly. Obviously not giving the whole thing much thoughts.Xu Fei, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d And then? That was it? Was he not touched at all? What about the ties between blood and flesh?Gu Shao merely told him nonchalantly to \u201ckeep an eye out on that child\u201d and that was that.-- Gu Shao was never one to pay too much attention on unimportant events. The appearance of the child was more of a surprise than anything else for Gu Shao.Except that\u2026She looked like him?Gu Shao recalled the dirty face and that pair of dirty hands that he saw in the afternoon and looked resentful all over again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Xu Fei came to deliver the good news. (1)Gu Shao\u2019s men found out the details of what happened that night at Imperial Court Hotel.As it turned out, while the Fourth Gu was having their wedding there that day, over on another floor of the hotel, the presidents and upper management of a few well-known companies in City B also had a gathering there that day.During the gathering, Lin Yize had with him Song Kexin, who was his lover and secretary. Someone suggested for Song Kexin to dance for them but she refused. That angered Lin Yize and, for that, he had offered up Song Kexin as a toy for the others.Lin Yize left with another woman that was offered up to him and Song Kexin was forced to drink a glass of \u201cwine\u201d by the others.It was chaotic but Song Kexin was able to escape at the crucial moment.Once the \u201calcohol\u201d had kicked in, Song Kexin ran around in a frenzy. She wasn\u2019t able to get out of the hotel but ended up in Gu Shao\u2019s rest area inadvertently.Gu Shao was unconscious in the rest area at the time but the plot against him by the Gu family was not yet over.Supposedly, Fourth Gu\u2019s newly wedded wife was supposed to walk into his rest area \u201cinadvertently\u201d. Lo and behold, Song Kexin truly ended up there inadvertently.\u201cAs Lin Yize had exercised the power of the Lin family to clean up all evidences before we found out and that our main focus wasn\u2019t this in the past, we have overlooked this part. This was our mistake,\u201d said the man on the phone with a lowered voice.Gu Shao did not comment on that. He quickly skimmed over the documents he had in his hand and finally saw the character \u201cLin\u201d.\u201cWhich Lin family?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cThe one in City B in the business of foreign trade. The once Lin Yu Corporation and now Lin\u2019s Corporation,\u201d explained the man on the other end of the call.Gu Shao nodded slightly and continue to flip through the documents.As for how Lin Yize came to later on, and how he didn\u2019t care about what had happened to Song Kexin; how the two were madly in love and displayed their love publicly; how they had formed a loving family; Gu Shao didn\u2019t care much about that other than finding it bizarre.\u201cAs such, Lin Xi\u2014\u201d\u201cWe have also looked into the time frame when Ms. Song had visited the hospital, the birth record, and a request to have an abortion that never took place. Judging from the timeline of actions that Ms. Song had proceeded with afterward, the child can very likely be yours\u2026\u201d said the other person cautiously.He paused, then carried on. \u201cThe other document was on Miss Lin Xi and also what had happened to her prior to her coming to see you.\u201dThe person\u2019s reference to Lin Xi had turned into \u201cMiss Lin Xi\u201d subconsciously \u2013 if Lin Xi was his boss\u2019s child, then she would, indeed, be their Miss.This document was much more detailed than the one on Lin Yize and Song Kexin. It started from Lin Xi\u2019s birth, from her family life to her school life, including every one of her examination scores. The amount of effort that was put into this document was obvious.Gu Shao quickly flipped to the very end of it. \u201cVillage Zhang?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s where Song Kexin\u2019s mother grew up. A few days ago, the Lin\u2019s chauffeur took Zhang Cui and Miss Lin Xi to Village Zhang. Zhang Cui left Lin Xi with a relative and returned to City B.\u201cIt\u2019d seem that the Lin family planned to have Miss Lin Xi stay in the village temporarily. What we don\u2019t know was how Lin Xi was able to leave Village Zhang and found you.\u201d\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cThis is all we have so far,\u201d replied the man. He thought about some and added, \u201cVillage Zhang is quite a bit of distance from City B. It must not have been easy for Miss Lin Xi to reach you.\u201dHis attitude toward this matter surprised Gu Shao. As far as he knew, Wang Wu was not one to express his personal thoughts at work.-- Wang Wu had gone through all of Lin Xi\u2019s information during the investigation. Most everyone was drawn to a strong and outstanding girl like her. And, from the information, Lin Xi did not have a very happy childhood at the Lin family.\u201cOkay. I get it,\u201d said Gu Shao before he ended the conversation and returned to the venue.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Xu Fei came to deliver the good news. (2)In the NTN apartment.As Xu Fei had told her to not wander around, Lin Xi decided to stay in the apartment for the entire day so as to not cause him any trouble. And she spent the day staring at her email inbox.Finally, Lin Xi saw the notification of a new email on the lower right-hand corner on the monitor.It was from one of the training institutions that she had sent her curricular vitae to previously.The content of the email was very simple. It started with some official thank you wordings followed by a link.It was a link to a test.Lin Xi quickly clicked on the link and was taking to the test page.It was a test on mathematics. There was a total of 20 questions. 10 of them were multiple choices and 10 were fill in the blanks. She had 60 minutes to finish it.Even though they were all multiple choices or fill in the blanks and only 20 questions but being able to complete all of them within the time limit was no easy feat. Each of the questions required a lot of calculations and, on top of that, one would not be able to find the answers online.Lin Xi moved the mouse around and quickly skimmed over all of the questions. The organization probably based the questions on her curricular vitae. These were about the same difficulties as the ones that she had done in previous mathematic competitions in the past and she had done many similar ones as well.The countdown started from the moment that she clicked on the link. Lin Xi waste no more time. She pulled out a notebook and started working on the first problem.The first one wasn\u2019t difficult. It took Lin Xi less than 5 minutes to get to the answer.Lin Xi only did half of the second one.This was the difference between a competition and an examination: One did not need to always get to the final answer.Take this problem as an example, from the calculation, the answer would be a negative number and not an integer. It was easy to narrow the answer down to B.Moving onto the third problem\u2026\u2026\u2026Lin Xi was fast, she completed 20 problems in less than 30 minutes.She hit \u201csubmit\u201d after looking over them one more time.The prompt spun around twice and the result was displayed on the screen.[100 points.]Lin Xi wasn\u2019t too surprised at this result but she, nevertheless, let out a sigh of relief.What she didn\u2019t know was that the test result was placed in front of the instructors at the facility along with others in the same batch.\u201cWe received 46 sets in this mathematics testing and all of them did quite well. 10 of them scored above 80; 3 of them above 90; and 1 of them even scored 100.\u201d\u201c100?\u201d An instructor standing nearby was surprised. An evaluation test for one\u2019s ability for competition was quite different from a normal examination. It wasn\u2019t easy just to complete all the problems, let alone getting them all correct.The teacher responsible for tallying up the scores smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the one that drew our attention yesterday.\u201d\u201cOh, her. Her awards were quite impressive in her curricular vitae. We even increased the difficulties of some of her problems. And she was still able to score 100?\u201d\u201cThis student is quite good. Which school is she from?\u201dThe teacher responsible for tallying took another look and said, \u201cShe didn\u2019t fill that out.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s reach out to her quickly. Isn\u2019t there a mathematics competition for junior high school students next month?\u201d\u201cOkay, let me go send her an email.\u201d***As such, Lin Xi was just about to click out of her mailbox when she saw a new email.It was from the same organization.They sent her an application form this time.Receiving this application form meant that she had passed their evaluation.Lin Xi filled in her personal and contact information.She provided them with her new cell number provided to her from Xu Fei.She had registered new social media accounts yesterday using this new cellphone number.This was a number that Song Kexin would not find out.She had 0 friends on them right now, but the list would grow.As Lin Xi was happily planning her future life, Xu Fei came and brought with him good news.\u201cPack up and come with me to the office structure,\u201d said Xu Fei with a smile.\u201cEh? Something happened?\u201d Lin Xi turned off the computer and put away the scratch papers that she was doing her calculations on.\u201cYour father is back.\u201dLin Xi, \u201c?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Xu Fei came to deliver the good news. (3)See that Lin Xi was still processing the information, Xu Fei added, \u201cBoss Gu. He\u2019s back. He will be arriving this afternoon.\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201d Lin Xi paused for a little bit and then there was joy in her eyes.Didn\u2019t they say 2.5 days? Seemed it had only been 2 days?\u201cYes, really. It sounded like they were done over there so boss decided to just head back to City B,\u201d explained Xu Fei.As for the details, he would have to start from this morning.***The final event for the forum ended this morning.There was a closing ceremony that the organizer had invited Gu Shao to be a guest speaker.Gu Shao declined them stating that he had something else that he needed to tend to and departed early from City N.Gu Shao gave Xu Fei a call from his car ride back.\u201cBoss.\u201d\u201cGo arrange for a paternity test,\u201d said Gu Shao concisely over the phone.Hearing that, Xu Fei was taken aback a little at first but then recollected himself quickly. He was even a little bit excited deep down inside. Did the boss decide on having a paternity test because he said the two of them looked alike? Or that he finally recall his crazy days way back when?\u201cAre you done with your conference, Boss?\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d\u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d Xu Fei felt the need to go give Lin Xi the good news.\u201cThis afternoon.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will arrange for a paternity test immediately.\u201d Xu Fei seemed even more emotional than Gu Shao.Having said that, Xu Fei did not hang up on the call. He waited and waited but nothing more came from his boss. He finally couldn't help but asked, \u201cBoss, anything else that you would like to know?\u201dLike how Lin Xi was doing the last couple of days? Was she settling in? Was she docile?\u201cNo,\u201d said Gu Shao simply.Xu Fei, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dXu Fei still came to deliver the good news to Lin Xi excitedly nevertheless.***\u201cSo I will be going to get a paternity test with my dad in a little bit?\u201d asked Luo Xiu.\u201cYes.\u201d Everything had already been arranged.\u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d asked Lin Xi.\u201cNothing. You just come with me to the technology center.\u201d Having said that, he noticed the solemn look on Lin Xi. Xu Fei thought she was worried. He comforted her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just a small test. And the results are pretty accurate.\u201dXu Fei was very confident in himself. Lin Xi looked like a clone of their boss. How could they not be father and daughter?Lin Xi nodded, then shook her head. She wasn\u2019t worried about the result. She was a little nervous at the thought of seeing Gu Shao again shortly.-- Would Gu Shao be able to accept the fact once his paternity was confirmed?***Lin Xi was taken to the 27th floor of the NTN Technology Center by Xu Fei.Xu Fei had her waited inside the small conference room but Lin Xi insisted on waiting with him at the elevator lobby on the 27th floor.Ding\u2014The elevator door opened.Lin Xi looked up and saw Gu Shao walking out of the elevator.The second that she saw Gu Shao, Lin Xi reflexively took half a step back.She quickly put on a bright smile with a hint of fawning when she noticed that Gu Shao was looking at her.-- Silly,That was what went through Gu Shao\u2019s mind when he was looking at the girl in front of him.There was, in addition, an almost undetectable surprise that flashed past his eyes.She was very different than how she looked three days ago. Lin Xi had on a clean set of clothes today and her hair tied back behind her tidily. The only thing that was on her fair face was a silly smile.Just as Xu Fei had mentioned early over the phone, this girl looked a lot like him.Gu Shao looked briefly at Lin Xi and turned away.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d said Gu Shao to Lin Xi before he headed over to the elevator on the other end.Lin Xi paused and looked over at Xu Fei, baffled.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to have the paternity test done as soon as possible?\u201d Xu Fei smiled and gestured for Lin Xi to follow them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - This is for my living expenses. (1)Luo Xiu was waiting to go with Gu Shao to have a paternity test done but she didn\u2019t think that they would be doing that right here at the NTN Technology Center. They didn\u2019t even need to leave the building to have it done.Lin Xi followed Gu Shao to the 9th floor.Different from the office building on the top, this floor was filled with all sorts of electronic technologies and research and development departments.Lin Xi was dazzled by all of them.Knowing that Lin Xi had an interest in these, Xu Fei made introductions to her in a low voice. \u201cThis floor consists mainly of electronic departments that have to do with biotechnology including development of medical devices, remote treatment systems, and biochips. A more commonly-known one is electronic medical records that had recently hit the market. Have you heard of it?\u201dYes!Lin Xi\u2019s eyes beamed and she nodded.Xu Fei wasn\u2019t even done talking yet and they have already arrived at the foremost laboratory labelled \u201cDNA-Biochip\u201d. The apparatus in there looked more high-tech than the best hospital that Lin Xi had been to in the past.As Xu Fei had already contacted them ahead of time, the machine and equipment for sampling were already ready to go.The process of blood drawn was fast and much less complicated than Lin Xi had imagined.\u201cOkay, we are done collecting the samples. We will start on the testing right away,\u201d said the technician who took the samples to Gu Shao. And, at the same time, they couldn\u2019t help but looked over at Lin Xi, the girl rumored to be the boss\u2019s child. She certainly looked like she could be his daughter.\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d asked Gu Shao.Lin Xi, too, perked up her ears \u2013 she thought they would say 1-2 days but the person said, \u201cAbout 10 minutes or so.\u201dLin Xi, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d That\u2019s how long it takes to have a paternity test done?Seeing the surprised look on Lin Xi, Xu Fei smiled and explained to her, \u201cOur machines here are on the leading edge of technology and much more advanced than many on the market. As such, testing, evaluations, and results are much faster here.\u201cPlus, we do not need to worry about errors. This machine is much accurate than those on the market as well.\u201dLin Xi nodded.***To one side, Gu Shao first raised his brows, then frowned as he watched Xu Fei interacting with Lin Xi. He had only been gone for two days and Lin Xi seemed to have already grown on Xu Fei.Feeling the look from his boss, Xu Fei shuddered inexplicable and stopped with the explanation.\u201cBoss, I can wait here if you need to go. I will bring the result upstairs to you when it\u2019s ready,\u201d said Xu Fei.\u201cBring it to my office,\u201d said Gu Shao as he turned and leave.Lin Xi followed him without being asked.***Lin Xi followed closely behind Gu Shao back to his office.Gu Shao started going through the documents that had been piled up in the last couple of days and Lin Xi stood in the same spot, not knowing what to do with herself.\u201cEm\u2026 Dad, uh, Boss Gu?\u201d Lin Xi called out to Gu Shao and he looked up.\u201cCan I sit over there?\u201d Lin Xi pointed at the couch to one side. It was kind of strange standing there in the middle of his office.\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d She didn\u2019t care whether Gu Shao was still listening to her. She walked over to the couch after thanking him.Sitting down on the couch properly, Lin Xi looked around the office. It was very big but nothing stood out about it. Much like Gu Shao, it was cold.***Gu Shao focused on the documents on his desk and didn\u2019t pay the girl much attention.Truth was, he wouldn\u2019t know what to say.It was until he had finished reading all the documents from the past two days before he looked up at the very quiet Lin Xi.Lin Xi, sitting on the couch, was no longer sitting properly as she was a while ago. She had her feet resting on the edge of the couch and they were swaying from side to side. She looked bored.-- No form.Was Gu Shao\u2019s comment about her in his mind.Then, Xu Fei knocked and walked into the office with the result of the paternity test that was fresh off the press.\u201cBoss, we\u2019ve got the result here,\u201d said Xu Fei as he handed the report over to Gu Shao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - This is for my living expenses. (2)The actual test performed and the details were not meaningful. As such, Gu Shao flipped straight to the last page and read the conclusion that was bolded.Lin Xi walked over and reached her neck as far as she could, wanting to see the conclusion.Unfortunately, Gu Shao had already closed up the report and placed it aside. His expressionless look gave away nothing.Looking over at Lin Xi, Gu Shao\u2019s look deepened.Lin Xi was very confident just a second ago but now she started feeling anxious from the way that Gu Shao was looking at her.\u201cSo, I\u2026\u201d am your real child, right?Lin Xi asked softly.Before Lin Xi could finish her sentence, Gu Shao interrupted her and asked, \u201cHow did you find out that I am your birth father?\u201dUpon hearing Gu Shao\u2019s words, Lin Xi\u2019s eyes flickered as she figured out the conclusion on the report \u2013 it confirmed the relationship between the two of them.Lin Xi knew that she would not be able to keep from Gu Shao what had happened to her in the past and with the Lin family. As such, she just told him the truth, \u201cI\u2019ve inadvertently overheard the conversation between my mom and grandma when they were talking about what happened in the past and how I was conceived.\u201dLin Xi skipped the part about the novel that she dreamed about; it was too metaphysical.Gu Shao nodded. He did not question the truth in her words.\u201cWhy did you come looking for me?\u201d Gu Shao asked.\u201cBecause, em, my life at my previous family wasn\u2019t all that great and I no longer wish to stay with them. That\u2019s why I came looking for you.\u201cIt\u2019s true. I am not lying to you.\u201d Lin Xi added, \u201cThe family was not nice to me as I am not their real daughter. Every since I was a child, I have always used what Lin Anxin had left over. Whenever she did something bad, I was the one being punished. This time, she had fallen into a pond after having conflict with someone and I was the one who got her out of it. Everybody insisted that it was me who pushed her into the pond. Nobody believed me. In addition, my mother and grandmother sent me to the village that they were from and I don\u2019t want to stay there\u2026\u201dLin Xi only said all these to convince Gu Shao that she was telling the truth and her determination in leaving that family. She had not noticed that she was behaving very much like a child coming home and telling her parent how she had been wronged by others.Gu Shao looked at Lin Xi. She wasn\u2019t lying. What she had told him aligned with what was in the report from Wang Wu. In fact, she had left out a lot.\u201cAnything else?\u201d asked Gu Shao.Lin Xi, \u201cUm, no. Those were more or less it\u2026\u201d-- Lin Xi hesitated a little and decided against sharing what happened at Zhang Qiang\u2019s place, her fever, and dreaming about Lin Yize.\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d asked Gu Shao, seemingly mindlessly.\u201cI booked an app=based car before my cellphone was taken away.\u201d Lin Xi explained.-- Okay, she wasn\u2019t stupid.Thought Gu Shao.Staring at the top of Lin Xi\u2019s head for a little while, Gu Shao said calmly, \u201cI have the obligation to support you until you are of age.\u201dSupporting Lin Xi was just an expense to Gu Shao. An amount that was negligible to him.Upon hearing that, Lin Xi looked up abruptly at him and her pair of light brown eyes were filled with pleasant surprise. \u201cReally? You will support me?\u201dGu Shao did not answer her question but his attitude said it all.\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! Thank you! I will be very easy to keep. I promise!\u201dGu Shao had no idea that the girl saw his answer as the turning point of her tragic future. His lips twitched when he saw the girl\u2019s excitement.\u201cI only guarantee you your living expenses and what you will need for your studies. And only till you are of age.\u201d Gu Shao stressed again.Lin Xi nodded violently. \u201cI understand. You only need to support me till I am of age.\u201dShe would be able to have control over her own actions then and would no longer need to worry about the Lin family\u2019s power over her.\u201cThank you, Dad!\u201d Lin Xi bowed solemnly at Gu Shao.Gu Shao, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dHe recalled how serious she looked when she said she would be \u201cat his deathbed\u201d. And, how did the \u201cDad\u201d just roll off her tongue so smoothly?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(3)She wasn\u2019t sure whether it was because he found her too rowdy, he had Xu Fei took her back to pack up her stuff.Returning back to the temporary apartment that she had been staying at the last two days, Lin Xi packed up her belongings and text books back into her luggage bag with alacrity.***By the time Lin Xi returned to Gu Shao\u2019s office, he was reading some research reports. Seeing that, Lin Xi decided to wait quietly on the couch.Gu Shao attended another meeting after dinner.He finally finished his work by 9 PM that night.Lin Xi was still looking at him excitedly with her big eyes then.\u201cAre you done with work, Dad?\u201dLin Xi stood up with him when she saw him grabbing his jacket and stood up.\u201cAre we going to go home now?\u201d asked Lin Xi.Gu Shao has yet to get used to the \u201cDad\u201d. \u201cYes, let\u2019s head out,\u201d said Gu Shao stiffly.\u201cOkay.\u201d***Lin Xi went back to Gu Shao\u2019s place that was fairly close to both NTN Technology Center and A University. She seemed very happy the entire way.Once they had arrived, Lin Xi studied the entire place from looking inside from the entrance. This place was huge but overall did not give the feeling that this is a residence. It looked very much like the office that she was just at.Gu Shao called out to her when he saw her standing foolishly at the entrance.Lin Xi finally stepped inside the house after she heard Gu Shao calling out to her.Once she got inside, she, once again, stood there in the middle while holding onto her luggage bag with both hands, not knowing what to do with herself.Gu Shao felt a bit of a headache when he saw that.\u201cPut your bag down,\u201d said Gu Shao as he pointed at a table to one side.Lin Xi shook her head and insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can just carry it.\u201dHaving said that, she tightened her grab on the bag.After what she had been through, the outside of the bag was very dirty. Lin Xi didn\u2019t want to dirty the table by putting it on top of it.Gu Shao decided to drop the subject. He pointed at a room door that was closed and said, \u201cThat will be your room from now on.\u201cXu Fei had gotten you what you need already, right?\u201d asked Gu Shao.Lin Xi nodded.\u201cWe will go get anything else that you might need tomorrow,\u201d said Gu Shao.\u201cOkay,\u201d replied Lin Xi in a low voice as she docilely walked over to the room that Gu Shao had pointed out to her with her luggage bag in tow.Noticing that Gu Shao was feeling awkward about suddenly having a daughter, Lin Xi tried to keep her presence to a minimum.***Later that night, however, Lin Xi came out of her room again.Lin Xi followed the light to the study.Gu Shao was reviewing a technical manuscript.As soon as Gu Shao looked up, he could see half of Lin Xi\u2019s head sticking out from the door. Noticing that she had been seen, she quickly hid behind the door as though she was about to walk away.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Gu Shao.Lin Xi stopped hiding after he had stopped her. She shuffled over to the door awkwardly and gave Gu Shao a guilty smile. She then asked, \u201cDad, am I interrupting?\u201dGu Shao didn\u2019t say a word. That was a yes.\u201cWhat is it that you want to talk about?\u201d He asked again.\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s this.\u201d Lin Xi hesitated for a few second then, walking inside the study, she placed what she had been holding in her hand onto Gu Shao\u2019s desk.Folded into a quarter of its original size, it was apparently a stack of money of different values. Some of them were 10 yuan.Gu Shao looked up at Lin Xi.Lin Xi, \u201cThis is my living expenses\u201dLiving expenses?Gu Shao\u2019s look lingered on that bundle of money.Over on this side, seeing that Gu Shao seemed to have frowned, Lin Xi quickly walked up and smoothed out the stack of money.As though worried that Gu Shao would find it not sufficient, she quickly added, \u201cThat\u2019s all I have for now. I\u2019ll pay you more next month.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - The broke down looks on the two of them looked almost identical. (1)Lin Xi had gone through great difficulty squeezing this money out from the Lin family. She had to hide it in the between the sleeves of her luggage bag in order to sneak it past Zhang Cui and the others\u2019 inspections in order to bring them with her.She finally pulled this money out when she was organizing her luggage.Seeing how Lin Xi looked nervous as though she worried that he would not accept it, Gu Shao\u2019s eyes and frown deepened.\u201cI said I will support you till you are of age and I will keep to my words. As a minor, you will not need to worry about your expenses during this period of time,\u201d said Gu Shao, his tone non-negotiable.Lin Xi was taken aback a little. Why that makes sense.She knew that Gu Shao didn\u2019t need the money to support her but, as long as he refused to accept it, she still felt uncomfortable.\u201cTake your money back,\u201d said Gu Shao.Lin Xi stood where she was, her fingers twisted together and she did not move.Gu Shao\u2019s frown deepened when he saw that. \u201cDo I need to repeat myself?\u201dLin Xi shook her head wildly.Finally, under Gu Shao\u2019s look, Lin Xi bit her lips, blurted out a, \u201cGood night, Dad,\u201d turned and dashed out of the study.The money was left where it was.Looking in the direction that Lin Xi had run away in and then back at the stack of money on his desk, Gu Shao felt a headache coming on.A not-so-obvious peculiar feeling also crept into his heart at the same time.***Lin Xi, returned to her own room, let out a sigh of relief. She packed away the luggage that she had brought with her.Unlike when she was staying at the temporary housing, Lin Xi put a lot of effort into putting her things away this time \u2013 if everything went well, she might be living here for a long time. All the way into her adulthood.Thinking of that, Lin Xi couldn't help but smiled uncontrollably from under the blanket. With this entirely different life, she should not end up the way she did in the novel, right?Lin Xi had no idea when she had fallen asleep. This was her first night here and everything was strange to her. Surprisingly though, she had a very good night of rest that night.***Gu Shao left the house as usual the next day.When he walked out of his room, the clanking noises coming from the kitchen caught his attention.Gu Shao then saw Lin Xi walking out from the kitchen, carrying two plates in her hands.Lin Xi\u2019s first reaction was to retract her neck as though she had been startled when she saw Gu Shao. Then, the very next second, she visibly gotten rid of her surprised look and gave Gu Shao a smile that was brighter than when a salesperson meeting their best customer.\u201cGood morning, Dad!\u201dGu Shao, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dAfter a long while, all Gu Shao did was nodded at her coldly.That didn\u2019t bother Lin Xi much. Still with a smile, she said to him, \u201cHave some breakfast, Dad.\u201dHaving said that, Lin Xi waved the plates in her hand in a showoff fashion. \u201cI\u2019ve made pancakes. There\u2019s a sweet one, a sesame one, and a green onion one\u2026\u201cWhich one would you like, Daddy?\u201dThat pancakes smelled very good and Gu Shao could smell a hint of green onion and sesame from a few meters away.Nevertheless, he had no intention of having breakfast at home.\u201cNo need.\u201d Gu Shao rejected her. Pausing for a little while, he added, \u201cYou can have them.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want any, Dad? I\u2019ve tried some earlier. They are very good.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need any.\u201d Gu Shao rejected her once again.\u201cOh.\u201dGu Shao felt a pang of guilt when he saw the disappointment on the girl and added an explanation, \u201cI am about to leave.\u201dLin Xi looked up, \u201cAre you heading into the office, Dad?\u201d\u201cNo, to A University.\u201dUpon hearing that, Lin Xi recalled that in addition to being the boss of NTN Technology Center, Gu Shao has another mighty identity: Professor at A University.Lin Xi\u2019s eyes flickered and she stopped him. \u201cWait, Dad.\u201dGu Shao saw her running back into the kitchen and came back out quickly with a lunchbox in her hand.As Gu Shao never told her which flavor he wanted, Lin Xi cut all three pancakes into halves and put half of each into the lunchbox. She then put the cover on the lunchbox and put it into its designated bag.Walking over to Gu Shao, she handed him the lunchbox and said, \u201cYou can take this with you, Dad.\u201dIn the novel, Gu Shao went to jail because he was set up by Lin Yize and finally died in jail. His cause of death of cancer to the esophagus causing him to not be able to eat.She had no idea how much truth there was to that or how much his eating habit had to do with cancer of the esophagus, but Lin Xi figured one couldn\u2019t be too safe.After looking at Lin Xi expressionlessly for a few seconds, Gu Shao finally accepted the lunchbox from her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - The broke down looks on the two of them looked almost identical. (2)At the university.The arrival of Gu Shao stirred up those on the office building floor.A few younger female professors couldn't help but started gossiping stealthily after they saw the lunchbox that Gu Shao brought with him.\u201cDid Professor Gu bring lunch with him?\u201d\u201cI think so. I have one that looks just like it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s incredible.\u201d Gu Shao didn\u2019t come to the university very often and it was definitely the first time he came with a lunchbox.\u201cDid he get married?\u201d\u201cWas he single before?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201d***Gu Shao walked inside the office and his assistant brought over documents on the dissertation defense that was going to take place shortly.\u201cProfessor, these are the topics on the dissertations and their supporting documents,\u201d said his assistant as he handed a few stacks of documents to Gu Shao. Looking at the blue lunchbox on his desk, the assistant asked, \u201cWould you like me to heat this up for you, Professor?\u201d\u201cNo, that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d He did not plan on eating it.\u201cOkay, I will let you be.\u201d The assistant was about to leave.After taking two steps, however, they were stopped by Gu Shao.\u201cProfessor?\u201d\u201cYes, heat it up.\u201d***After breakfast, Gu Shao went over to the classroom for the dissertation defense along with the documents.Gu Shao was one of the judges today for the dissertation defense of a group of phD students.There were 8 groups in total and each group would go on stage to present their research topics, demonstrate their results, and defend their dissertations.Unlike the comments from the other professors, Gu Shao was not \u201cgentle and loving\u201d like the others. His comments were concise and cut straight to the point. He had no intention of sparing the students\u2019 feelings.As it turned out, his comments were straight to the point and nobody would argue with him. When they thought it through, there was a lot to be learned from his comments.All the way until the last group for the morning.The female student stood on stage nervously for the defense portion. She looked like she was about to cry.\u201cThe biggest problem with your research topic isn\u2019t that the design is not mature but that it lacks a clear and concise positioning for its application\u2026\u201d said Gu Shao bluntly.Seeing that the girl was about to cry, Gu Shao was taken aback all of a sudden and reflexively recalled a girl standing in front of him, her fingers twisted together, looking as though she had been wronged.For once, Gu Shao\u2019s tone mellowed a little and he switched to saying, \u201cThe design itself isn\u2019t bad. You should spend more time on thinking through its outlook and market positioning. I hope to see a more comprehensive defense next time.\u201dA pleasantly surprised look flashed past the girl when she heard Gu Shao\u2019s words. She nodded quickly.She was still very surprised when she walked off the stage. Professor Gu was known to be very harsh. But she felt that he was alright?The students who were not comforted by him expressed that: It\u2019s not fair!***The defense for the day was over. When Gu Shao got ready to leave, he was stopped by the other professors.\u201cProfessor Gu, Professor Liu is taking us out to dinner tonight. Care to join us if you don\u2019t have somewhere to be?\u201d said one of the professors \u2013 Professor Gu was normally a very busy person. It wasn\u2019t everyday when they had an opportunity like this. He would love to be able to chat with him about the RSK chip developed by his Center.Gu Shao didn\u2019t have any plans but, remembering that he now has a child at home, Gu Shao finally declined the other professor\u2019s invitation.***That night, when Gu Shao returned home, he immediately smelled the delicious aroma of dinner when he opened up the door.Seeing Gu Shao\u2019s return, Lin Xi\u2019s eyes lit up and she quickly took Gu Shao\u2019s things in his hands from him in a fawning manner and showed him to the dining room.Dinner was already ready on the table by now along with two pairs of chopsticks.Looking at the few dishes that didn\u2019t look half bad, Gu Shao raised his brows.\u201cYou made these?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I did.\u201d Lin Xi nodded.She placed the order for the ingredients on her cellphone and had them delivered. As for the dishes, she had never made them before but they didn\u2019t seem too difficult. Lin Xi was able to find the recipes online and made them by following the steps in the recipes.\u201cThank you for taking me in, Dad,\u201d said Lin Xi to Gu Shao solemnly. Now that she was living under his roof and eating his food, she must be on her best behavior. She didn\u2019t want him regret and abandon her.\u201cLet\u2019s eat, Dad.\u201d She had asked Xu Fei ahead of time. Xu Fei told her that Gu Shao didn\u2019t usually have dinner when he went to the university.Lin Xi handed the bowl and chopsticks over to Gu Shao.Noticing the white spots on her hands from the toothpaste, Lin Xi quickly placed the bowl and chopsticks in front of Gu Shao and retracted her hands.\u201cWhat happened to your hands?\u201d asked Gu Shao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - The broke down looks on the two of them looked almost identical. (3)\u201cNothing.\u201d Drawing blank, Lin Xi made up something casually. \u201cI forgot to wash my hands earlier.\u201dTruth was, she had never made a formal dinner like this before and everything was new to her. She had accidentally burned herself. Not knowing where there was a first-aid kit in this house, she had no choice but to apply some toothpaste for the time being.\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d Gu Shao didn\u2019t move. Looking at the house that had obviously been cleaned and the table full of food in front of him, Gu Shao was finally aware of a problem: These chores, including housework and cooking, should not be Lin Xi\u2019s responsibilities.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do these,\u201d said Gu Shao in a deep voice.She was at the age to be taken care of.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. They are all very easy tasks. They can cancel out part of my expenses.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Gu Shao\u2019s tone became more solemn.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d It didn\u2019t seem like there was anyone else other than her who would do that?As though he had read Lin Xi\u2019s mind, Gu Shao said, \u201cI\u2019ll arrange to have someone come over.\u201dHave someone come take care of this child.Hearing the decisiveness in his tone, Lin Xi nodded quietly.\u201cLet\u2019s eat now,\u201d said Gu Shao.\u201cOkay.\u201d Lin Xi smiled again. She scooped out rise for Gu Shao and pushed it in front of him.Under Lin Xi\u2019s eager look, Gu Shao placed a piece of vegetables into his mouth.It tasted surprisingly normal.It wasn\u2019t just the looks as he had expected.***After dinner, Lin Xi was going to clean up but she was forced by Gu Shao to return to her room.Gu Shao cleaned up outside, placed a call to Xu Fei and had him look for a domestic help who could cook and clean.Xu Fei was very efficient.The aunty came the next morning and brought breakfast with her.\u201cSir, Miss, time to get up. I bought these meat pancakes and soy milk at the place next to the bus stop. Have some while they are still warm.\u201d As the aunty talked, she found her way into the kitchen, located the bowls and chopsticks after some looking around, and transferred the meat pancakes and soy milk into the bowl.She then wiped off the little bit of soy milk that spilled onto the table before she made room for Gu Shao and Lin Xi.Over on this side, without needing any arrangements, Aunty had already walked into the living room and started picking up with alacrity.She wiped down the couch, then the coffee table.She was using the same brown rag that she had just used to clean up the spilled soy milk.When she walked past the room, she even wiped down the door handles with the same rag.Looking at the very efficient Aunty, Lin Xi, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dThen she looked over at Gu Shao.The broke down looks on both of them looked almost identical.Before they have even finished breakfast, Gu Shao had already paid the aunty for the day and had Xu Fei recalled her.Lin Xi let out a sigh of relief when the aunty with questionable decision choices was gone.Lin Xi logged back online to check after Gu Shao had taken off.Lin Xi received emails from four different training facilities in the last few days. Their main focuses laid with mathematics, physics, chemistry, and English.All of them offered fairly competitive offers. If Lin Xi entered the competition representing the training facility, she would be able to keep the prize money and the training facility would pay her two times the amount of the prize money as a reward. If it was a competition that did not offer prize money, the training facility would still award her between 6,000 to 18,000 yuan depending on where she ranked.If she could collect prize money, she could pay 3,000 yuan to Gu Shao for her living expenses and save up the remaining 3,000 yuan.Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t competitions of this type every month. Most of them were only hosted once a year. Not very many of them offered good payout.Besides, Lin Xi looked at the list of competitions provided by the training facility, and the next mathematics competition coming up would be next month.Lin Xi bit her fingers and felt regretful.She exited out of her email inbox and logged onto an informational website.There were a lot of information about new competitions on this site. In addition to the usual academic subjects, there were also information on innovative technology type competitions that were less academical and geared more toward working individuals.Lin Xi scanned over each and every single one of them, not wanting to miss anything.A red and bolded one was very difficult to overlook.\u201cThe First Tianchuang Innovative Technology Competition?\u201d Lin Xi looked at the name of the competition and the date behind it. She couldn't help but clicked into it.This was a competition geared toward electronic technology research. It included environmental friendliness, medical, artificial intelligence, and future technology areas. Competitors could submit their projects on a new technology under one of the four areas and one winner would be chosen from each area for further development. Other teams would also receive their opportunities to market.And each team would further receive a prize award of\u2026\u201cA million yuan?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - Gu Shao seemed to have completed forgotten that Lin Xi is a 14-year-old junior high school student who needs to go to school. (1)Looking at the prize amount, Gu Nian\u2019s eyes widened and her jaw almost fell off. She rubbed her eyes and counted the number of zeroes again. She was right, 1,000,000 yuan.A million-yuan prize money for one competition? That was too good to be true, right?Lin Xi couldn't help but grumbled to herself.With this amount of money, it would not only last her through her studies. If she could save enough of it, she and her father just might have enough to support themselves for the rest of their lives should Gu Shao truly go bankrupt because of Lin Yize.Lin Xi was already daydreaming about her wonderful life after winning the prize money and how to spend it.After some foolish chuckling, Lin Xi shook her head and brought herself back to reality.-- If what was at stake was high, a million-yuan prize money was not inconceivable. A good technology project could very well bring in profit that would well exceed a million yuan.As such, a prize amount this high was not incomprehensible.But it also meant that the difficulty of this competition well exceeded that of the others.This \u201cTianchuang Competition\u201d did not gear toward students. It was geared, instead, toward professionals with experiences or research teams in universities. It was very different from innovative technology competitions that were geared toward ordinary teenagers. The one that were geared toward teenagers only required the competitors to provide an innovative idea or modeling at a theoretical level. This one, however, required the final product and results to be delivered.This was not something a poor junior high school student with nothing other than her brain could pull off.Looking at the prize award one more time regretfully, Lin Xi sighed, left the homepage of the competition, and went back to browse the competitions that were geared toward high school students.After spending some time in browsing around, Lin Xi locked onto two specific competitions: An innovative technology competition with traffic as the subject and an ordinary high school innovative technology competition.Lin Xi clicked into the application page after she made her decision.She filled in her name and age\u2026But she was stumped when she got to the school field.She wouldn\u2019t be returning to her old school but there wasn\u2019t another school that she could put down.She must fill this field out or she would not even be able to submit her application.Lin Xi spent a lot of time troubled in front of the computer. She put down a different school name, hesitated, and deleted it again.Finally. Lin Xi had no choice but to close out of the application page.When she logged out of the webpage, Lin Xi couldn't help but looked at the message area on the lower right-hand corner of the webpage again. The entire area was filled with information about Tianchuang Competition.Because of the high amount in prize money, not only was Lin Xi shocked when she saw it, it had stirred up quite a lot of waves in the field as well.Many started talking about this competition in the forum and someone even set up a specific page just for the discussions on Tianchuang Competition.Lin Xi couldn't help but clicked into it.By now, there were already dozens of messages discussing about just anything.[C\u2019mon, y\u2019all. Let me know how many out there are joining this competition for the prize money.][Question: Will the winner really be granted the right for developing their project?][We are a design team and have a good project in mind. We are looking for a team with experiences in production and development to work with us. Drop us a line if you are interested.][All of my roommates are overseas. Anyone looking to start a team?][I have a lot of experiences in scientific research and I am looking for teammates. Serious people only.]***As it involved final product, it could not be done by one person. As such, there were many strings like this recruiting for team members online.Lin Xi randomly clicked into one of them and the original poster was happily chatting away with the others.See that they were more or less done chatting, the thread owner tossed out the ID of a group. [This is a group that I have just started. Feel free to join if you are interested, regardless of whether you want to start a team together. We can always chitchat and share information on the competition.]The group owner was very light-hearted.Lin Xi, her brain drawing blank for a split second, keyed in the string of numbers and sent a request to join the group.She wasn\u2019t too concerned when she didn\u2019t see a response after she had sent the request.Quickly, her heat of the moment incident was forgotten.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - Gu Shao seemed to have completed forgotten that Lin Xi is a 14-year-old junior high school student who needs to go to school. (2)That afternoon, as Gu Shao had told her to not make dinner, Lin Xi only made a few pancakes and waited for Gu Shao to come home.She waited for a long, long time but Gu Shao still had not returned.She wanted to talk to Gu Shao about something so she was reluctant to go to bed. She decided to wait in the living room and stared blankly at the door.Finally, she had no idea when she had fallen asleep.***There was a product testing today and Gu Shao stayed very late at NTN Technology Center.It was almost midnight when he got home.The house was dark and quiet. The familiarity of it almost made Gu Shao forgot that he has a child.Gu Shao didn\u2019t think much and just assumed that the child had gone to bed.Lo and behold, he saw someone curled up on the couch when he walked passed the living room.Lin Xi, who was asleep, had no idea that someone had walked up next to her.As though she was feeling cold, she curled up some more on the couch and tried to shoved her toes in between the cushions.Her cellphone clutched against her chest. In it was the call that she was going to place to Gu Shao but finally didn\u2019t.Gu Shao frowned upon seeing that: Does she not have a bed? Why was she sleeping here?And, should he wake her up or not wake her up? And how to wake her up become a problem that Gu Shao found troubling.Luckily, Lin Xi rolled over at this point, almost fell off the couch, and woke herself up at this moment.Lin Xi opened up her eyes groggily and saw Gu Shao standing in front of her.Startled, Lin Xi almost fell off the couch again.\u201cGu Gu, Gu\u2026 uh.\u201d Lin Xi woke up and quickly said, \u201cDad.\u201dPutting on a guilty smile, she greeted him. \u201cDad, you are home.\u201dGu Shao looked at Lin Xi. \u201cGo sleep in your room.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Xi nodded, docilely get up from the couch, and returned to her own room groggily.She was still carrying the cushion from the couch with her.***After returned to her room, Lin Xi climbed straight into bed and was just about to fall asleep when her eyes widened. Oh, shoot! She had forgotten to talk to Gu Shao about what she had wanted to talk aboutI!Lin Xi wanted to go talk to Gu Shao but, recalling that his tone sounded somewhat stern earlier and he seemed a little unhappy, Lin Xi, curled up in bed, intimidated, pulled her neck back some and finally decided against it.The final outcome was that Lin Xi, with her thought weighting down on her, stared at the ceiling and finally feel back asleep around midnight.***Wanting to talk to Gu Shao the next day, Lin Xi set her alarm to get up early.Surprisingly, Gu Shao got up even earlier than her.And had breakfast prepared.Breakfast was the pancakes that she made the night before, with a bowl of noodles.\u201cStart eating.\u201d Gu Shao gestured Lin Xi to sit down. His tone cold and nonchalant as usual.Gu Shao did not explain himself when he noticed the surprised look from Lin Xi. He felt that he should not let a child cook so he got up early to cook.\u201cGood morning, Dad.\u201d\u201cThank you, Dad!\u201d In addition to fawning, there was real emotion in this thank you as well.Lin Xi was genuinely flattered.Nobody ever cooked for her when she was at the Lin family. If she had missed the meal time for whatever reason, she could only sneak into the kitchen and make herself something.Sitting at the dinner table, Lin Xi started with the noodles.Lin Xi was prepared. Even if it tasted awful, she would still put on a look that they were delicious and eat them appreciatively.Lo and behold, when she had a bite of it, the bowl of noodles wasn\u2019t half bad.In fact, it was very good. The kind that she liked.***Seeing that Lin Xi would glance over at him secretly from time to time as she eat and looked like she had something to say, Gu Shao asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dLin Xi was organizing her thoughts but, being interrupted by Gu Shao, she suddenly forgot what she had in mind.\u201cThat, Dad, can you take me to school? My previous school\u2026 is a bit far. I think I should switch to a different one.\u201d Lin Xi looked at Gu Shao with anticipation: She would need her parents to be here to transfer her to a new school. For sure she could not turn to her mother or Lin Yize for help on that.Gu Shao\u2019s hands paused in midair when he heard that.\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d With zero experience with children, he seemed to have completed forgotten about it: That Lin Xi was just a 14-year-old junior high school student and she needed to go to school.Covering up the slight embarrassment in his eyes, Gu Shao responded expressionlessly, \u201cSure.\u201dThat made Lin Xi very excited.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - She quickly sent over the pictures that she had taken. (1)That afternoon, Gu Shao had Xu Fei brought Lin Xi from his apartment to NTN Technology Center.When Lin Xi arrived, Gu Shao had just gotten out of a production discussion.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Gu Shao took her downstairs when he saw Lin Xi.Go? Go where?Lin Xi was stupefied.She, nonetheless, followed closely behind Gu Shao to the parking lot and into the car.Gu Shao wasn\u2019t planning on selling her, was he?Lin Xi grumbled to herself.***The car drove out of the NTN Technology Center and right into Affiliated Junior High School of A University (HSAU). Lin Xi finally realized that Gu Shao was taking her to school because of what he promised her in the morning.\u201cAm I going to be attending this school from now on?\u201d asked Lin Xi looked from outside of the car window to Gu Shao. There were unconcealable excitement and anticipation in her eyes.\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d said Gu Shao fairly. She did need to take a test before she was accepted into the school.***The two of them went over to the office building.The teacher that they met up with was a woman in her thirties, with the surname Chen.As the leadership had already made arrangement for this student\u2019s testing today, the series of entrance examinations were already prepared.Teacher Chen learned of the gist of Lin Xi\u2019s situation and brought her over to the classroom that had been prepared.Inside the classroom, the teacher explained everything to Lin Xi. \u201cAs you were in your sophomore year in your previous school and didn\u2019t seem to have fallen behind too much, this is to test your knowledge on sophomore year materials.\u201cThe questions on here were from last month\u2019s monthly examination. It should be of appropriate difficulties. Some of them are more difficult than others but there are not a lot of those. Most of them should have been covered in your previous school.\u201d These questions were perfect for their purposes right now and they would not need to come up with a new set of test questions.Lin Xi nodded.At this time, a very tall teenage boy walked inside of the testing classroom with both hands in his pockets, looking sleepy.\u201cTeacher, why did you ask me to meet you here?\u201d The teenage boy asked Teacher Chen.Seeing that he was there, Teacher Chen took a look at the time and frowned. \u201cSheng Xiuyan, I asked you to come at 3 PM. What time is now?\u201d\u201c3:10 PM?\u201d The teenage boy by the name of Sheng Xiuyan took a look at his cellphone and replied casually, \u201cOur literature teacher did not let us out on time.\u201dTeacher Chen, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d Yeah right! The last class was art. The literature teacher asked for the allotted time but was then swapped out by the physics teacher. This brat probably slept through the entire class and had no idea which teacher was there.\u201cTurn off your cellphone and hand it to me. Then go sit over there.\u201d The teacher pointed at a spot inside the classroom and said sternly.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cExamination,\u201d said Teacher Chen. \u201cYou missed the monthly examination. It so happened that we have a new student coming today so the two of you can take the examination at the same time.\u201dSheng Xiuyan happened to have a competition the same time as the monthly examination so he didn\u2019t take any of them.Sheng Xiuyan frowned. \u201cDoes it make any difference whether I take the examinations or not?\u201d\u201cYou let me worry about that.\u201d Teacher Chen gave Sheng Xiuyan a stare and said, \u201cThe head of your class had said it already. The scoring of these examinations will count toward your final scores of the year. You pay attention. Hurry up and stop wasting our time. Go take your seat.\u201dSheng Xiuyan shrugged indifferently but walked inside of the classroom anyway.He glanced over at Lin Xi and sat two spots away from her.\u201cWe will be testing you on 5 subjects \u2013 English, Literature, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. The long questions that were crossed out can be skipped; no need to do the essay part for literature; and skip the listening comprehension for the English section and just do the first essay. The final scores will be pro-rated for the monthly ranking.\u201d Teacher Chen explained as she handed out the examinations to the two of them.Teacher Chen took a look at the time again and said, \u201cYou have 180 minutes in total with no break in between. Pace yourself.\u201dTeacher Chen gave Sheng Xiuyan a warning look and then a much milder look when she turned toward Lin Xi.\u201cJust do what you would normally do and skip the ones that you can\u2019t answer. Don\u2019t be nervous.\u201dLin Xi nodded and took the examinations from Teacher Chen.As they would be taking all 5 subjects at the same time, Lin Xi wasn\u2019t particular about the order she did them in. She skimmed over all five of them and started from the mathematics one.Lin Xi had heard of HSAU. They ranked No. 3 among public school and her previous school was ranked #1 among private ones.They two schools had always viewed each other as competitors subtly and otherwise. The two schools competed in all areas including the quality of their teaching and their results in competitions. As such, the contents and progresses in both schools were comparable.These examinations were not difficult for Lin Xi.She was fast.As she didn\u2019t need to write the essay for literature, Lin Xi completed all five examinations in less than two hours.Sheng Xiuyan tossed down his pen almost at the same time as Lin Xi.Without so much at looking over in her direction, Sheng Xiuyan turned in his papers, yawned and left.Lin Xi looked away from him, turned her attention back onto her examinations, looked through them one more time before she turned them in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - She quickly sent over the pictures that she had taken. (2)Gu Shao was still there waiting for her when Lin Xi followed the teacher back into the office. Waiting with him was a woman in her fifties.When they walked over to them, Teacher Chen said, \u201cDirector Zhou.\u201dDirector Zhou looked over at Lin Xi. She looked surprised. Then she looked from Lin Xi and Gu Shao.\u201cThis must be your daughter, Professor Gu. She\u2019s very pretty,\u201d said Director Zhou with a smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you have a child her age.\u201dGu Shao was a professor at A University and was an acquaintance with this Director Zhou right here. That being said, Professor Gu was a very busy man and never stuck around one place long enough. He also never talked about his personal life.\u201cShe is staying with me for now,\u201d said Gu Shao. Until she was of age.Director Zhou, however, interpreted what he said differently.Director Zhou, taken aback a little, thought he had it figured out. She smiled again and said, \u201cAn, she must be your niece then. No wonder they always said nieces look like their uncles. She does look a lot like you. I almost thought she\u2019s your daughter.\u2019Gu Shao did not bother correcting Director Zhou.Director Zhou took Lin Xi\u2019s examination paper from Teacher Chen and looked them over. She nodded and said, \u201cThis is quite good.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t tell whether the answers were correct or not but the neatness of them look impression at a glance.Having said that, Director Zhou looked over at Gu Shao again, \u201cThe principal was going to be here today but she had to attend a meeting the last minute so she had me come in her place.\u201cWe will have the results on these latest by tomorrow. I will let know right away, Professor Gu.\u201d Director Zhou paused, then went on, \u201cThe main purpose of this is just to get an idea of where the student stands and give us an idea of which class to place her. It would not affect anything else. You don\u2019t have to worry about a thing, Professor Gu.\u201dDirector Zhou reassured Gu Shao. What she was trying to tell him was that regardless of how Lin Xi scored or whether she meet the passing grades, she would be accepted to their school.It sounded like they had Lin Xi\u2019s best interest in mind but, if one was to think about it some more, it also sounded like they were making an exception for her.Glancing over at the very disturbed look on the girl, Gu Shao tried not to smile and did not elaborate further.He declined Director Zhou\u2019s offer to show them around the campus and took off with Lin Xi.***On their way back, Lin Xi looked unhappy. Her lips were pushed out so much that one could hang a hook on it.Glancing over at her look, Gu Shao lifted his brows.\u201cYou don\u2019t like this school?\u201dLin Xi shook her head and didn\u2019t say anything.She couldn\u2019t possibly tell him that she was unhappy that Gu Shao denied that she was his child earlier.She didn\u2019t want to stir up anything. As far as Gu Shao was concerned, she was an accident who just popped up out of nowhere.Lin Xi bit her lower lip and looked over at Gu Shao. Smiling, she said to him, \u201cThanks, Dad. I will study hard.\u201d***The father and daughter went back home.Lin Xi was surprised that there was a new aunty there.She looked to be in her fifties or sixties but she was good spirited. And has much better temperament than the one last time.She was waiting for Gu Shao and Lin Xi at the door.Lin Xi seemed to hear Gu Shao referred to her as \u201cAunty Mei\u201d.Aunty Mei nodded at Gu Shao first then couldn\u2019t wait but looked behind him at Lin Xi.The second that she saw Lin Xi, her eyes beamed and she could barely contain her excitement.\u201cThis must be Little Miss Xi.\u201dSeeing the surprised look on Lin Xi, Aunty Mei quickly added, \u201cLittle Miss Xi, my surname is Mei. You can call me Grandma Mei. I will be taking care of you from now on.\u201dLin Xi was baffled by her affection given that this was the first time the two met each other. That being said, she didn\u2019t dislike her friendliness.Lin Xi nodded and said politely, \u201cGrandma Mei.\u201dAunty Mei had a bright smile on her immediately.\u201cYou must be hungry, Little Miss Xi. C\u2019mon in quickly. Dinner is ready.\u201d Aunty Mei took Lin Xi\u2019s backpack and showed Lin Xi into the apartment.Lin Xi turned to look at Gu Shao.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d said Gu Shao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - She quickly sent over the pictures that she had taken. (3)Aunty Mei showed Lin Xi to the dining room.Lin Xi thought the dinner that Aunty Mei was talking about was just a few regular dishes. Lo and behold, the second that she walked inside of the dining room, Lin Xi thought she was looking at the Manchu-Han Imperial Feast.\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d Just the two of them plus Grandma Mei. Were they overdoing it a bit with this much food?Seeing the surprised look o Lin Xi, Aunty Mei quickly explained, \u201cIt was my first time cooking for Little Miss Xin and I didn\u2019t know what you like. So I made a little of everything.\u201dTruth was, when she was preparing dinner, Aunty Mei wanted to make everything for Lin Xi and inadvertently made all the dishes that she was good at.\u201cJust pick the ones that you like.\u201cWhat do you usually like, Little Miss Xi?\u201d asked Aunty Mei.\u201cI can do anything,\u201d said Lin Xi.\u201cAh, you are not a picky eater. That is wonderful.\u201dLin Xi, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d What kind of filter is that?\u201cAnything you like in particular?\u201d asked Aunty Mei again. \u201cDo you prefer sweet or savory dishes?\u201dLin Xi thought about it some and said, \u201cSweet.\u201d\u201cCan you eat spicy food?\u201dLin Xi shook her head.\u201cWhat about sweet and sour?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lin Xi nodded.Aunty Mei smiled and said, \u201clittle Miss Xi\u2019s taste is exactly the same as that of Old Sir.\u201dLin Xi didn\u2019t know who was this \u201cOld Sir\u201d that she was referring to but she certainly seemed to have some knowledge of herself and Gu Shao.Did they know each other from before?Lin Xi thought to herself as she ate.That being said, Aunty Mei\u2019s cooking was amazing. Lin Xi felt that her cooking was even better than those of the 5-star chefs that Song Kexin had hired in the past.***On this end, seeing that Lin Xi enjoyed her cooking, Aunty Mei\u2019s smile deepened.When neither Gu Shao nor Lin Xi were paying attention, Aunty Mei pulled up her cellphone and snapped a picture of Lin Xi.After dinner, Gu Shao went over to his study for a call and Lin Xi stood up to help with the dishes.Aunty Mei stopped her right away.\u201cNo, no, little Miss Xi. Let me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I can at least help you bring them into the kitchen.\u201d Lin Xi was well aware that she was staying under someone else\u2019s roof.Seeing that Lin Xi had already picked up the bowls and dishes and walked into the kitchen, there was not much more that Aunty Mei could do to stop her.That being said, she took the opportunity to snap a few more pictures of Lin Xi.***By the time the kitchen was picked up, Aunty Mei returned to her room, pulled out her cellphone, located the pictures that she took earlier and quickly sent them over to the one who had been clutching on his cellphone and waited for the past hour.One text from Aunty Mei and it was a like a bomb had been dropped at the other Gu\u2019s place.At Gu\u2019s house.Old Mr. Gu, who had been waiting all night long with his cellphone, perked up all of a sudden and sat up straight when he received the text.\u201cI got it. I got it. Let me check out our little princess.\u201dHearing his words, the two young boys around the same age as Lin Xi also tossed away the games that they had been playing and ran over excitedly. \u201cGrandpa, are they pictures from Grandma Mei? Let me see. Let me see.\u201dNext to them, even the usually calm and steady Big Brother Gu scooted over Old Mr. Gu curiously.The few of them stuck together and waited for Old Mr. Gu\u2019s ancient cellphone to spin a few times before a picture finally loaded up.\u201cSo this is Xiao Xi?\u201d\u201cLet me see.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so pretty!\u201d\u201cOf course. She\u2019s one of ours!\u201d His cellphone in hand, Old Mr. Gu\u2019s happiness was uncontainable. He acted as though Lin Xi was standing right in front of him.\u201cShe looks quite like Second Brother,\u201d said Gu Feng, the oldest of the Gu\u2019s as he nodded.His words earned him a stare from Old Mr. Gu. \u201cMy granddaughter is so cute. She doesn\u2019t look like the jerk Gu Shao at all!!\u201d\u201cShe does, kind of, look like Second Uncle,\u201d said Gu Yanxiao.He, too, got a stare from the old grandfather.\u201cNope. Xiao Xi looks like your grandmother.\u201d\u201cBut Grandma didn\u2019t have dimples. Look, Xiao Xi has a dimple here.\u201d Gu Chenyi, too, pointed at the not-so-obvious dimple on Lin Xi in the picture.Old Grandpa insisted on what he had said. \u201cShe got that from me.\u201d All in all, it had nothing to do with that jerk.Having said that that, Old Grandpa hrumphed in a dramatic way and said, \u201cThis Gu Shao, he didn\u2019t even tell me after he found his daughter. I\u2019d still be in the dark had I not pulled it out of Wang Wu!\u201dAs much as he was griping about Gu Shao, Old Grandpa wasn\u2019t able to contain the smile on him.Even Gu Feng couldn't help but smiled secretively when he heard Old Mr. Gu\u2019s words. Aunty Mei had been working for them over dozens of years and was almost like a butler. Of course they would have noticed that something was going on when his second brother asked for her.\u201cGrandpa, grandpa. Looks like Grandma Mei had just sent something else. Go look at it.\u201d\u201cI know. Can\u2019t you tell I am doing just that?\u201d\u201cJust click on the picture again and it will bring you back out.\u201d\u201cCan you upgrade to a faster cellphone, Grandpa?\u201d The four of them were anxious all over again as they stared at the cellphone when it downloaded the new picture.Finally, another picture of Lin Xi appeared on the cellphone.\u201cShe\u2019s even prettier from this angle!\u201d\u201cHurry up. Hurry up. There are more pictures. Just swipe left.\u201dAnother picture appeared.This one, however, was one of Lin Xi carrying the bowls and dishes toward the kitchen.Old Mr. Gu frowned. \u201cWhat is Aunty Mei doing? How could she let Xiao Xi clean up? I am going to have a talk with her. We can always send more help over if they need.\u201dAll three other men next to him nodded in agreement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Lin Xi\u2019s household register still laid with the Lin family. (1)After shooing away the three other men, Gu Qinghua brought his cellphone in front of a photo of his late wife.\u201cWife, look. Our second boy\u2019s child. She looks just like you when you were young.\u201dHe talked some more in front of his wife\u2019s picture and was very happy with the photo in hand. \u201cOur family has a little princess now.\u201dThe Gu family only had sons for a few generations, never a daughter. His wife was finally pregnant with a daughter once but had lost the baby inadvertently right before delivery. That had become a permanent pain in the old grandpa\u2019s heart.Sighing, the old grandpa pulled out his cellphone again and looked at the photos. He was unable to his phone down.After he had clicked out of it, he flipped to an old buddy\u2019s WeChat and recorded a voice message, \u201cSo what if your family has a daughter!\u201dThen he played it back to himself pridefully a couple more times.Over on the other end, Old Grandpa Shen was speechless when he heard Old Grandpa Gu\u2019s voice message.\u201cWhat was wrong with this Gu Qinghua?\u201d He had almost deafened him.***On this end, Lin Xi had yet to find out that she had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by Aunty Mei.After dinner, Lin Xi returned to her own room, pulled out her old text books and reviewed the chapters that she was behind on.Then she pulled out her cellphone.On her phone, the request that she had sent to join the group that she had long forgotten had been approved.The corners of Lin Xi\u2019s lips twitched when she saw the goofy group name Battle at the Summit of Tianchuang.She clicked into the group and did not see the crazy discussion that she had anticipated. There were all three people in the group, including her \u2013 AAA was the owner of the group, herself, and someone with the alias Lin. His profile was grayed out, obviously offline.There were also just a few lines in the group, all of them from the owner of the group.[AAA]: The victory of this competition belongs to me![AAA]: We can do this together. The strong must join forces.[AAA]: Somebody. Talk.***Suddenly, a new message popped out, still from the owner of the group.[AAA]: @X, welcome, our new member!Lin Xi, who was just about to click out of it, her hand stopped in midair.[X]: Apologies, Group Master, I was just here to chat.She wasn\u2019t good enough for a competition of this caliber.[AAA]: Oh, that\u2019s fine too. You just got here. Stay for a little while.[AAA]: I have done a lot of research on this competition. We can always exchange our thoughts on it.[X]: How come I am not seeing a lot of others around?She recalled that the discussion was quite lively in the forum earlier. Did this seemingly goofy owner of the group scare the others away?The owner of the group explained.[AAA]: They were mostly just talk, or that they had already formed their own team and were just there to see if they could gleam some information. They wouldn\u2019t really join the group chat.Was that so?Lin Xi was taken aback a little. Why did she feel that she was the only one that was fooled?Then there was another brother who was offline.[AAA]: Are you solo or have you already joined a team?[X]: Just me.[AAA]: Well, that\u2019s great. Why don\u2019t you join us then?That was kind of sloppy, no?Lin Xi couldn't help but thought.She had no idea how to tell him that she hadn\u2019t planned on joining a competition of this caliber, so she made up something on the fly: Let me think about it.[AAA]: That\u2019s fine. Take your time. You are in our group chat already. We will save a spot for you on our team.[X]: Thank you.Lin Xi clicked out of the chat and, hesitated for a little, felt that the owner of the group was quite pitiful and stayed in the group.With whatever few members in the group, it\u2019d go away on its own anyway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Lin Xi\u2019s household register still laid with the Lin family. (2)The next day, by the time Lin Xi had gotten up, Aunty Mei had already prepared breakfast for her and Gu Shao.After dinner, Lin Xi stayed home as usual and Aunty Mei went out in the middle of the day.When she returned that afternoon, Aunty Mei was carrying with her bags and bags of stuff. There were still two more delivery personnel behind her with two boxes of stuff.Lin Xi had initially thought they were Aunty Mei\u2019s luggage but she saw Aunty Mei pulled out a box and handed it over to her with a smile.\u201cLittle Miss Xi, this is a new cellphone for you. Take a look and see if you like it.\u201dThis new cellphone looked like one of the latest models. It was pink and there was a cute bow on its back. It looked to be custom made.Before Lin Xi had recovered from the pink, she saw Aunty Mei pointed at the other boxes and said, \u201cThese, too, are for you, little Miss Xi.\u201cOver here are clothes and those are school supplies. Little Miss Xi is about to start school soon, right? These should be of use to you.\u201dAunty Mei opened up the boxes and all Lin Xi could see was a sea of pink.Pink clothes, pink shoes, pink hair ties, pink backpack, pink stationary pouch\u2026 pink pens\u2026With the exception of a few white ones, the rest were all pink. Dark pink, light pink, bright pink, dim pink\u2026 all sorts of pink.\u201cYou take the stationaries with you. Grandma Mei will wash these clothes for you first before you wear them,\u201d said Aunty Mei.Lin Xi finally recollected herself.\u201cThank you, Aunty Mei.\u201d How could she possibly turn down such passion?But\u2026\u201cHow much did they cost? Let me pay you back,\u201d said Lin Xi.As much as Grandma Mei seemed to be an acquaintance of Gu Shao, Lin Xi couldn\u2019t just accept all these things from her.Grandma Mei smiled and explained it to her. \u201cGrandma Mei did not spend a penny. I was just there to bring then back here.\u201dThese were all gifts from the few over at the Gu family. She merely went over to bring them back after she received their call.The cellphone was from Old Mr. Gu.Old Mr. Gu stared at Lin Xi\u2019s photo for half the night and finally noticed that her cellphone screen was cracked. He made a call and had someone looked for a new cellphone for Lin Xi in the middle of the night and he asked for the prettiest one too.***Upon hearing that, Lin Xi assumed that Aunty Mei had bought them with Gu Shao\u2019s money.The only thing that she wasn\u2019t sure about was whether the sea of pink was Gu Shao\u2019s taste or that of Aunty Mei.Looked back over at the sea of pink, Lin Xi couldn't help but rubbed her eyes.***That night, by the time Gu Shao was home, Lin Xi had already folded and put away all the pink clothes that Aunty Mei had washed and dried. And the pink backpack and school supplies as well, naturally.Lin Xi was syncing her phone on the table.It would take some time for her to sync her new phone with her old one.Gu Shao noticed the very eye-catching color of the cellphone as soon as he walked into the living room. He looked over at Aunty Mei.\u201cIt\u2019s from Old Sir,\u201d said Aunty Mei. She then paused before she added, \u201cThen there are some clothes and school supplies.\u201dGu Shao frowned a little but finally didn\u2019t comment on it.\u201cHave you had dinner yet, Sir? Let me go make you a bowl of noodles,\u201d asked maa.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I ate already.\u201d Gu Shao declined her offer.At this time, the syncing of Lin Xi\u2019s phone was 98% completed.The voice memo that was being synced right now caught Gu Shao\u2019s attention \u2013 evidence?The school was very efficient and Gu Shao received the call from HSAU the next day.The principal placed the call in person this time.\u201cHI, Professor Gu. I hope I am not interrupting.\u201d The principal was very polite over the phone.Gu Shao gestured the person reporting the development progress to him to pause for a second and said to the principal, \u201cNo, you are not.\u201d\u201cOh, good.\u201d The principal paused for a little, then said, \u201cWe have the scores from Lin Xi\u2019s entrance examinations from yesterday. She did very well.\u201dThat was an understatement.With Lin Xi\u2019s scores in her hand, even the principal couldn't help but felt emotional.-- Literature - 96, mathematics - 100, English - 98, physics \u2013 100, chemistry \u2013 100.With this kind of scores, she would for sure bring up their school\u2019s average scores in the future.She learned that the point deductions in literature and English were because they skipped the essay section to the teacher grading them deducted some points accordingly.Gu Shao raised his brows when the principal told him Lin Xi\u2019s scores over the phone but he wasn\u2019t particularly surprised.The principal said again, \u201cWith her grades, she could total handle being assigned to our AP (advanced placement) class.\u201dKnowing that Lin Xi was a relative of Professor Gu, the principal had contemplated whether to assign her to a better class for his sake.Little had he known that that would not be necessary at all. With Lin Xi\u2019s grades, she could get into the top class with no problem.\u201cShe can start next Monday.\u201d\u201cThank you, Principal,\u201d said Gu Shao.\u201cYou are very welcomed, Professor Gu.\u201d\u201cI have another question.\u201d The principal asked again, \u201cWill she only be joining us temporarily or will she be transferred into our school permanently?\u201d\u201cWhat is the difference?\u201d Even though Gu Shao was a professor at A University, but he knew very little about the system.\u201cMainly it is a matter of her enrollment. If she is only enrolled here as a temporary student, she will attend classes here but will need to return to her previous school for important examinations such as final examinations or any unified examinations.\u201cIf she is to be here permanently, she will need to go through the official channel and be enrolled at our school instead of her previous one.\u201dWith her potential, naturally Principal Zhao would love for Lin Xi to transfer into their school.As such, Principal Zhao gave Gu Shao the spiel about HSAU over the phone once again.\u201cI get it. Thank you, Principal Zhao.\u201d Having said that, Gu Shao ended the phone call.He recalled Lin Xi telling him that she did not wish to return to her old school. As such, she probably wouldn\u2019t mind much transferring to this new school.Nevertheless, that would bring about a new problem: They need her household register in order to transfer officially into the new school.-- Lin Xi\u2019s household register still laid with the Lin family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - Wait! We are going to the Lin\u2019s?! (1)Chen Zhiyang saw their professor sitting in front of his desk, in deep thought, staring at a stack of reports on one of their research and development projects when he walked inside Gu Shao\u2019s office.\u201cSomething wrong this project?\u201d asked Chen Zhiyang.\u201cNo, it is fine.\u201d Gu Shao recollected himself and pushed the reports aside.\u201cDo you know what I will need to add someone onto my household register?\u201d asked Gu Shao casually.Chen Zhiyang was taken aback a little and immediately made the association: The professor was going to add Xiao Xi under his household register?It so happened that Chen Zhiyang had a cousin who wanted to attend school in City B a while back and had transferred her household register under him.Chen Zhiyang thought about it some and said, \u201cYou need a proof of acceptance from this end. Then you will need to visit the original location to have the original household register transferred out, then come back here to have it transferred back in.\u201dThinking about it some, Chen Zhiyang reminded him again, \u201cYou will probably need some proof like a paternity test or something.\u201dGu Shao gave Chen Zhiyang a look but didn\u2019t say anything.***Gu Shao went home early for a change that night and asked Lin Xi the same question that he had asked before. \u201cWhy did you leave your previous family to come here?\u201dLin Xi paused for a little then, without thinking, said, \u201cBecause my days back there was rough, so I came.\u201d\u201cThere was nothing else?\u201d asked Gu Shao.Lin Xi shook her head.Gu Shao\u2019s look deepened. After looking Lin Xi in her eyes for a few seconds, he said in a deep voice, \u201cEven though you are not of age yet but you should learn to be responsible for your own behavior. You will have to live with the consequence of your own decisions that you make right now.\u201cYour household register is still with your mother. You can choose to return to the Lin family. Of course, it will still be my obligation to support you until you are of age.\u201cSimilarly, you can stay here until you are of age. For the sake of convenience, I will move your household register over.\u201dGu Shao handed the decision over to Lin Xi.His tone sounded emotionless.Aunty Mei, not too far away, overheard his words and was anxious: She had no idea what was the story with Lin Xi\u2019s birth mother but she heard that she already had her own family and wasn\u2019t all that nice to Lin Xi.Now that the child was already here, did Mr. Gu really intend to send her back?Nevermind that she already didn\u2019t want to part with Lin Xi after taking care of her for just two days.Old Mr. Gu would throw a fit if Mr. Gu really send Lin Xi away.What Aunty Mei hadn\u2019t told Gu Shao yet was: The few over at the Gu family was already picking out new names for little Miss Xi for her household register. They didn\u2019t have one just yet because they couldn\u2019t agree on one. In addition, the not-so-superstitious Old Mr. Gu had also hired a renowned fortune teller to determine the best day to add Lin Xi into their genealogy.***As opposed to Aunty Mei, Lin Xi\u2019s eyes beamed when she heard Gu Shao mentioned that he would move her household register over.-- She had forgotten about that problem altogether. If only she could have her household register moved out of the Lin family, she would sever all ties with the Lin family for good. She would no longer live with Song Kexin; she would have nothing else to do with Lin Yize nor would she be Lin Anxin\u2019s sister. That way she could completely avoid the plot in the novel.\u201cI want to be with Dad!\u201d said Lin Xi without any hesitation.\u201cYou sure about it now?\u201d\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d Lin Xi nodded violently.Perhaps the smile on the girl was too bright that it became infectious. The look of Gu Nian softened some without him even noticing it.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you to the Lin\u2019s and moved your household register over.\u201d\u201cYee\u2026\u201dLin Xi was half way through her word when she stopped.Wait! Going to the Lin\u2019s?!The idea of going over to the Lin\u2019s to transfer out her household register made Lin Xi turn pale.Part of the reason that she resented returning to the Lin\u2019s was her fear about the story plot but there was another important reason: If she was to head to the Lin\u2019s with Gu Shao, the fact that Gu Shao was her birth father would be exposed ahead of time.Once Lin Yize had found out that Gu Shao was the first man of his beloved woman, would he target Gu Shao early?Even though Gu Shao had always been very mighty in Lin Xi\u2019s mind, but Lin Yize was still the man with the male lead halo.\u201cNo.\u201d Lin Xi shook her head immediately.\u201cYou don\u2019t want your household register transferred out?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201dLin Xi didn\u2019t know how to explain the matters of the novel to Gu Shao. Struggling with that for a long while, she finally came up with a very bad reasons: \u201cI know you are a very busy man. I can go talk to my mom and the others on my own. You won\u2019t need to come with me.\u201d\u201cOr I can have Uncle Xu Fei or Grandma Mei to come with me.\u201dOne way or another, Gu Shao could not go.Gu Shao, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d He might be busy, but not so busy that he would need someone else to transfer his daughter\u2019s household register for him.When Gu Shao did not rebut her, Lin Xi assumed that he had agreed. She smiled at him and said, \u201cOkay. So that\u2019s settled!\u201d\u201cGo to sleep.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Lin Xi turned and walked toward her room. Half way there, she noticed that she had forgotten something and turned back around to say to Gu Shao, \u201cGoodnight, Dad.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - Wait! We are going to the Lin\u2019s?! (2)After Lin Xi had returned to her room, the pondering look on Gu Shao deepened.Gu Shao dialed Wang Wu.\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cLin Xi was sent to the village before?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Wang Wu recalled. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t seem she stay there for very long.\u201d\u201cGo look into it. I want to find out what happened when she was there and when she was at the Lin\u2019s. I want more details than we previously had.\u201d Gu Shao did not miss the fear and panic that flashed past Lin Xi\u2019s eyes when he mentioned going to the Lin\u2019s.There was no reason why she would have such a strong reaction if her days were \u201cjust difficult\u201d back at the Lin\u2019s.Besides, from the few days that they had been together, Gu Shao could tell that Lin Xi wasn\u2019t a spoiled brat or one that couldn\u2019t handle any adversity. Quite the contrary, she was a child who was very good at controlling her emotions. As such, if the days were \u201cjust difficult\u201d, she would not have come to look for a father that she knew nothing about.Wang Wu, upon hearing Gu Shao\u2019s order, immediately realized something: What they had found out previously was not comprehensive.\u201cOkay, I get it. I will have someone look into that right away,\u201d said Wang Wu solemnly.Gu Shao called up Xu Fei next.\u201cWhat do I have going on tomorrow?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Xu Fei flipped through his calendar and replied, \u201cYou have a meeting to talk about the SSI project tomorrow morning and the team from Willr will be visiting tomorrow afternoon. In addition, we have received two invitations for some activities.\u201dXu Fei, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d\u201cMove the meeting to the week after and have someone else meet with the team from Willr. Decline the two activities and free up my calendar,\u201d said Gu Shao.\u201cFor the entire day?\u201d Xu Fei was just about to ask what important thing was Gu Shao going to be attending to when Gu Shao spoke again.\u201cIn addition, notify the family of the president of the Lin Corporation. I will be paying them a visit tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSure, Boss.\u201d Xu Fei didn\u2019t have enough time to think about which Lin family he was talking about so he just said yes.Xu Fei finally realized after he had ended the phone conversation that the Lin Corporation, Lin family, wasn\u2019t that Xiao Xi\u2019s birth mother\u2019s family they were talking about?Lin Xi noticed, to her surprised, that Gu Shao was still home when she got up the next morning.She had a bad feeling.\u201cGood morning, Dad.\u201d Lin Xi put on a smile anyway and greeted Gu Shao. This had already become part of her daily routine.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to head into NTN Technology Center today, Dad?\u201d Lin Xi paused, then added, \u201cOr the school?\u201dGu Shao looked away from the book in his hand and looked at Lin Xi. \u201cLet\u2019s have breakfast first. Then we will head to the Lin\u2019s place together.\u201dLin Xi, \u201c! ! !\u201dSo, when Gu Shao remained silent yesterday, he wasn\u2019t consenting to what she had said but had his mind made instead?\u201cThat\u2026\u201d really won\u2019t be necessary. She could go by herself.Lin Xi wanted to object some more but, when she saw the determined look in Gu Shao, she gave in immediately.She nodded and sat down at the dining table and had her breakfast quietly.Seeing the disturbed look on Lin Xi, Aunty Mei thought she was worried about returning to her old place. She comforted her softly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Xiao Xi, your Dad will go with you. He will have everything taken care of.\u201dHaving said that, Aunty Mei even picked out an outfit for Lin Xi specifically for her trip.One could tell just with their naked eyes that this was probably the most expensive set among all of her clothes. It was not cheap.\u201cIs this a bit too high-key?\u201d said Lin Xi in a low voice when she saw the outfit.Why did she feel that she was there to show off and stir up stuff at the Lin\u2019s in this outfit?\u201cNo, not at all. You should dress up nicely and let your birth mother and adoptive father see that you are fine over here. They will be more reassured for you to live with Mr. Gu that way.\u201d What Aunty Mei said almost sounded reasonable.Her real thought was: That family had treated Xiao Xi poorly. We should let them see how nice Xiao Xi\u2019s days had been since she had come over here.They may not think much of little Miss Xi over there but, over at the Gu\u2019s, she was treasured!Lin Xi did not opine on Aunty Mei\u2019s argument but she did not decline her kind thoughts either.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - \u201cThis is some information that I was able to gather.\u201d (1)The father and daughter duo took off.Lin Xi sat quietly next to Gu Shao.Had she not been glancing over at Gu Shao from time to time, she\u2019d look like a statue paused in animation.Gu Shao looked over at Lin Xi out of the corner of his eye. \u201cYou nervous?\u201dLin Xi shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that. I have a question\u2026\u201d Having said that, Lin Xi has some hesitation.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou and my mom, um, I am talking about Miss Song Kexin. How did it all happen?\u201d Lin Xi asked in a low voice.If Gu Shao knew about the Lin family, he must have found out about what happened back in the days as well. All she wanted to know what how bad was the incident between Gu Shao and Song Kexin and whether there was still wiggle room between the male and female leads and the cannon fodder for discussion or de-escalation.Gu Shao, however, interpreted her words very differently.His look froze on him and the corners of his eyes twitched visibly.Under what circumstances would a man and a woman conceive a child?Gu Shao\u2019s face dropped. He gave Lin Xi a solemn look and said, \u201cYou are still a child. This is not something that you need to worry about.\u201dBesides, he was unconscious the entire time and had no idea what really had happened.All Gu Shao was aware of was the outcome of the incident \u2013 the existence of Lin Xi.See how solemn Gu Shao looked, Lin Xi took that as it was a bad \u201caccident\u201d. She shut her mouth, feeling slightly awkward, and dared not ask any further. She started contemplating how to deflect Lin Yize\u2019s revenge on Gu Shao.***It was quiet inside the car and they quickly arrived at the Lin\u2019s mansion \u2013 the place that was very familiar to Lin Xi.Gu Shao looked down at Lin Xi next to him. When he saw her grabbing tightly onto the seatbelt looking like she was faced with something dire, his eyes flickered.\u201cWait for me in the car.\u201d Having said that, Gu Shao planned to have Lin Xi wait in the car for him while he went to talk Lin Xi\u2019s birth mother and adoptive father about the transferring of her household register.There was no way that Lin Xi would agree to that. She quickly jumped out of the car after Gu Shao and insisted, \u201cI will go with you!\u201dGu Shao looked away. Either way was fine with him. \u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201dThe security guard in the front showed them to the front of the mansion.Xu Jiaofeng was the first to walk out.When she saw Gu Shao, then Lin Xi behind him, she looked extremely unhappy.\u201cYou ungrateful white-eyed wolf, vile thing! The Lin family had raised you all these years. We failed to teach you how to be grateful but this is how you repay us?\u201d Xu Jiaofeng was frantic and she started yelling at Lin Xi immediately.Part of the reason she agreed to Zhang Cui\u2019s suggestion of sending Lin Xi over to the Zhang Village was so there would be less drama at home.Had the person who claimed to be this Boss Gu\u2019s assistant didn\u2019t call yesterday and informed them that Boss Gu would like to visit them and briefly told them the reason of the visit, they would still have no idea that Lin Xi had long since ran off from Zhang Qiang\u2019s place.AND located her birth father to top.After receiving the phone call, everybody was so angry and shock that nobody really thought about how Lin Xi was able to eavesdrop on their conversation, learned about where she came from, and able to connect with her birth father. All they could think of was how much of a trouble she was.Then there was that Zhang Cui. She couldn\u2019t even find a man reliable enough to keep an eye out on a child.Nevertheless, now that Lin Xi had already found out about where she was from, she no longer needed to put up the front.Xu Jiaofeng stood there, stuck up, and looked at Lin Xi coldly. She did not bother hiding the dissatisfaction and hatred in her eyes.\u201cI knew you are one that could not be tamed. What else could you do other than bringing about troubles?\u201d She couldn\u2019t have just stayed quietly in the village? She had to bring her birth father all the way here for more drama?Xu Jiaofeng couldn\u2019t even begin to image how much the Lin family\u2019s reputation would be tarnished if any little bit of this entire incident was leaked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - \u201cThis is some information that I was able to gather.\u201d (2)Ever since she was a child, Lin Xi had been used to being yelled at by Xu Jiaofeng. She was already numbed from it. Lin Xi bit her lower lip and lowered her eyes. She ignored the irrelevant shouting coming from Xu Jiaofeng.Gu Shao noticed all about Lin Xi\u2019s submissive attitude and manner toward Xu Jiaofeng turned cold all of a sudden.\u201cI trust that my assistant had clearly conveyed to you the purpose of my visit. If Old Mrs. Lin believes that I am here to cause trouble, that is find as well.\u201dGu Shao\u2019s cold look and attitude made Xu Jiaofeng\u2019s heart dropped. She took half a step back reflexively.Then there was the last thing that came out of Gu Shao. That was a blatant threat.***At this time, Song Kexin, asked to stay away by Xu Jiaofeng had also walked out of the house with a long face and leaning in Lin Yize\u2019s arms.When she saw Gu Shao, her look immediately changed. Her deeply shameful memory that plagued her day and night came flooding back to her that very instant.That was the darkest blemish in her life.The \u201cwine\u201d that she drank made her lost control of herself. She had no idea what had happened but, somehow, she had taken Gu Shao as Lin Yize at the time.Song Kexin was so distressed afterward that she had contemplated killing herself. If it was Lin Yize who had admitted to his mistake and taken care of her attentively, she would never have been able to move forward from that.It was bad enough to have Lin Xi in front of her all the time, but now Lin Xi had to find the man and brought him to her?Song Kexin had mistaken Gu Shao as Lin Yize that night and had completely forgotten about Gu Shao look afterward. But now, looking at Gu Shao. Song Kexin couldn't help but felt an extremely repulsiveness.Consequently, there was seeping hatred in the way that she looked at Lin Xi.-- If Lin Xi hadn\u2019t gone looking for this man, she could completely forget that this had ever happened.Lin Xi did not miss the disgust and hatred in Song Kexin\u2019s eyes when she looked at herself and Gu Shao.-- It was even said in the novel that what had happened was an accident. Why did she make it out to be all Gu Shao\u2019s fault?Was Lin Yize completely guilt0free for offering up Song Kexin to a group of animals?If one really thought about it, Gu Shao was the victim in this entire incident, alright?Lin Xi reflexively felt wronged for Gu Shao\u2019s sake.Lin Xi also found the disgust in Song Kexin\u2019s eyes when she looked at Gu Shao disturbing.Something occurred to her and she looked up at Gu Shao.-- she worried that the clich\u00e9 trope of man and woman had an intimate relationship inadvertently and, when they met each other again years later, the man had fallen madly in love with the woman would happen to Gu Shao.Lin Yize and Song Kexin were the official couple in the novel. If Gu Shao was to fight over the female lead with the male lead, then the only thing waiting for him would be to killed or maimed by the male lead.Lin Xi looked at Gu Shao anxiously. Luckily, the way that Gu Shao was looking at Song Kexin could not have been colder. The incident in the past did not seem to have changed anything.***Feeling the change in his wife\u2019s mood, Lin Yize\u2019s arm around his wife tightened, comforting her.Then he turned and looked at Gu Shao.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Boss Gu.\u201d Regardless of the hidden torrent between the two, Lin Yize still demonstrated the appropriate level of politeness and indifference toward Gu Shao.\u201cShall we discuss this inside?\u201d Lin Yize gestured at Gu Shao. \u201cThis way please, Boss Gu.\u201dHe glanced over at Lin Xi while he was at it.For a split second there, Lin Xi picked up a hint of Lin Yize\u2019s hatred. Her heart tightened. As frightened as she was deep inside of her, as though reflexively, she placed herself in front of Gu Shao.It was an obvious protective stance.Never mind that Lin Xi\u2019s small body had nothing to do with the word \u201cprotective\u201d no matter how one looked at it.A hint of surprise flashed past Gu Shao\u2019s normally calm and indifferent eyes. Lin Yize, too, gave Lin Xi a profound look.The atmosphere became awkward for a little while there.At this time, Gu Shao pulled Lin Xi back next to him and blocked her from Lin Yize\u2019s look.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - \u201cThis is some information that I was able to gather.\u201d (3)The few walked inside the Lin\u2019s residence.There were never a lot of signs that Lin Xi was a part of this family and now, there were even less.All of the servants had been sent away from the living room.Gu Nian and Lin Yize sat on both sides of the couch and neither one of them talked. The atmosphere was very tensed.Lin Xi stealthily looked from one of them to the other and then back to the first one.From an objective perspective, Lin Xi felt that Gu Shao\u2019s aura was every bit as strong as Lin Yize\u2019s.And he was handsomer than Lin Yize to top.Lin Xi could swear that she did not fell that way only because she had on a \u201creal father\u201d filter.She recalled the two\u2019s abilities, status, and family background. They seemed to be comparable.Gu Shao even had more proper morals than the old Lin Yize.As such, why was it that Lin Yize was the male lead and that Gu Shao was doomed to be taken care of by him?Lin Xi found that very unjust.She had no idea when she started siding with Gu Shao in her subconscious.***Drumming on the armrest of the couch, Lin Yize was the first to start. \u201cBoss Gu\u2019s assistant had informed us over the phone yesterday that Boss Gu\u2019s purpose of visit today is to transfer out Xiao Xi\u2019s household register. That being said, why would we just take your words that you are Xiao Xi\u2019s father?\u201dUpon hearing that, Gu Shao said nonchalantly, \u201cI am not in the business of raising someone\u2019s child.\u201dTranslation: He only made the trip there because Lin Xi was his child.Nobody knew for sure whether there was subtext in his words but Gu Shao\u2019s words made the members of the Lin family changed colors.-- Was he mocking him?Lin Yize narrowed his eyes and a sense of viciousness flashed passed them.\u201cIs that so? I guess congratulations are in order,\u201d said Lin Yize without letting his true feelings show. He paused for a little bit then said, \u201cThat being said, my wife carried her for 10 months and gave birth to her. I love my wife and this child.\u201dLin Yize\u2019s words did not make Lin Xi feel touched. Quite the contrary, it gave her chills down her spine.Lin Yize went on, \u201cXiao Xi had been living with us for 14 years and has always been a part of this family. It didn\u2019t seem right that Boss Gu wants to just take her away from us like this. Besides, I need to have my wife and my child\u2019s best interest in mind as well.\u201dTranslation: Their family had feelings for Lin Xi and he did not want to let her leave.Xu Jiaofeng was baffled when she heard Lin Yize\u2019s words: Lin Xi being in their family was always going to be a hassle, a problem. Now that the opportunity arose for them to get rid of her, isn\u2019t that wonderful? Why was it that her son wanted to keep the girl?Not only Xu Jiaofeng, even Song Kexin was baffled by Lin Yize\u2019s intention. From where she stood, if this child was willing to leave with her birth father and that Gu Shao was willing to raise her, then letting her leave this family with Gu Shao wasn\u2019t a bad idea at all.***Lin Xi, too, gave Lin Yize a strange look. She had no idea what was up with him either.Lin Xi subconsciously recalled that terrible dream of hers and how Lin Yize appeared at the very end of it. She shuddered. She wondered whether Lin Yize\u2019s odd attitude had anything to do with her dream.Gu Shao still didn\u2019t show much reactions.\u201cBoss Lin feels that it\u2019s better for Lin Xi to stay at the Lin\u2019s?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dLin Xi seemed to have heard a snicker coming from Gu Shao before he pulled out a stack of papers from the document folder in his hand and placed them in front of Lin Yize.\u201cThis is some information that I was able to gather.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - \u201cThis is some information that I was able to gather.\u201d (4)Gu Shao started to talk in a low voice, \u201cWhat Lin Xi uses, eats, and even wears were mostly leftovers from Lin Xi, that included her cellphone.\u201dAfter he had said that, Xu Jiaofeng was the first who felt embarrassed \u2013 her son didn\u2019t care much about the b*stard child and Song Kexin, the mother, didn\u2019t care much about her either. Xu Jiaofeng was the one who was irked by the Lin Xi\u2019s existence and not wanted her to spend a penny of the Lin\u2019s. As such, she was the only who instructed the servants that there was no need to supply Lin Xi with good things.\u201cThe two of them were similar in ages. It is perfectly normal for them to share what they use in their daily lives. What is the big deal? Your saying that it is always Lin Xi who uses Xinxin\u2019s leftovers is a bit inappropriate, I\u2019m afraid, Mr. Gu.\u201d Xu Jiaofeng argued.Gu Shao ignored Xu Jiaofeng and went on, \u201cTwo years ago, Lin Xi won an essay competition online but was told that she had withdrew from the competition. In truth, Lin Anxin was the one who got the award in lieu of Lin Xi and also attended the summer camp offered by the host. The reason being that an award from this competition will add scores to one\u2019s high school entrance.\u201cSix months ago, there were posts in the school forum that badmouthed Lin Xi, which had negatively impacted her. The school was about to take the matter seriously and look into the person who was behind the incident. As it turned out, this incident was suppressed later on and never brought up again. It was the Lin\u2019s idea to suppress the incident and the culprit behind the incident was Lin Anxin.\u201cThen, there was the incident not too long ago where you accused Lin Xi of pushing Lin Anxin into the lake.\u201dGu Shao\u2019s voice was very nonchalant but all those that had happened in the past were still very vivid in Lin Xi\u2019s mind.With the exception of Gu Shao and his daughter, everybody else looked very unhappy.\u201cThat\u2019s just conflicts between two siblings. There was no need to take it public,\u201d said Lin Yize.Gu Shao had a mocking look on him.\u201cFive years ago, Madam Song and her mother went out with both children and ran into robbers on their trip. Madam Song and Madam Zhang got out of the car and took off with Lin Anxin, leaving Lin Xi behind purposefully as a decoy\u2026 \u2026\u201dSong Kexin\u2019s face froze. Recalling what happened that day, she couldn't help but rebutted, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I wasn\u2019t able to run away effectively with both children. Besides, the cops got there shortly afterward.\u201d\u201cAnd then.\u201d After a slight pause, Gu Shao carried on, \u201c9 years ago, Madam Lin went out with Lin Xi and lost her. That was intentional. Later on, Lin Xi was sent over to the television station and you only gave up on your plan because you didn\u2019t want the incident to be blown out of proportion.\u201d\u201cYou are making this up!\u201d Xu Jiaofeng jumped up. \u201cShe got loss because she was running around wildly. What did that have to do with me?!\u201dThat was not pre-meditated. At the time, the child wanted to give her candies at the time and followed her around the house. She couldn\u2019t handle her any more so she said she was going to take her out\u2026\u201cWhat Boss Gu had found out in his investigations seemed to deviated some from the facts,\u201d said Lin Yize calmly.\u201cOkay, then how do you explain this?\u201d Gu Shao tossed another document on top of the coffee table.It was a donation agreement and the record of a match.The donor on the donation agreement was Lin Xi and the match was between Lin Xi and Song Kexin.That jotted Lin Xi\u2019s memory.Two years ago, the condition of Song Kexin\u2019s lung had gotten worse and Lin Xi didn\u2019t really know the details. It seemed it was very serious. Song Kexin was hospitalized for 4 whole months. She heard that she was finally cured by a team of specialists from overseas.Lin Xi was taken to the hospital once. She thought it was just a normal checkup; she had no idea that it was for organ-matching.Lin Xi had never seen that donation agreement ever.Was Song Kexin not cured, was their plan to trade her life for hers?Did the plan to somehow kill her first so they would be able to transfer her organ onto Song Kexin?The idea of it gave Lin Xi a chill down her spine.Lin Xi reflexively grabbed onto the corner of Gu Shao\u2019s cloth as if wanting to find a sense of security.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - In addition, there seemed to be a recording. (1)That very moment, the room was so quiet that one could almost hear a hair falling onto the floor.Nothing else need to be said.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that it is a good idea for Lin Xi to stay with the Lin\u2019s,\u201d said Gu Shao coldly.\u201cAs the birth father of the child, I will take her with me. If Boss Lin and his family believe that I should compensate you, I can cover all expenses incurred by Lin Xi at the Lin\u2019s in the past 14 years.\u201dLin Yize\u2019s face was long. He didn\u2019t say anything. It was obvious that Gu Shao came well prepared. Now he had become the passive one.Letting Gu Shao bring Lin Xi with him was the only way out of this.He could come up with some other ideas afterward.After some considerations, when Lin Yize was just about to say something, Song Kexin, who has had a long face and remained silent all along stood up suddenly and lost control of herself.\u201cYou are right! I hadn\u2019t been nice to her. But was that my fault?!\u201cShe never should have been born. I didn\u2019t want to have her. It was you! It was all your fault! If it wasn\u2019t for you, we would not have this accident. My first time would be with Yize and we would only have our old child in our family.\u201d Song Kexin accused Gu Shao madly and placed all blame on him.Lin Xi couldn\u2019t listen to this anymore. Frowning, she retorted, \u201cThis was all Lin Yize\u2019s doing. What did it have to do with Boss\u2026 uh, what did it have to do with my father? He\u2026\u201dLin Xi was half way through what she was saying when Song Kexin turned and looked at her. The hatred in her eyes were frightening.\u201cYou! It was all you! All of my misfortunes were because of you!\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, my family would be the happiest of all families! Why did you have to be born?!\u201cWhy? Oh? Why aren\u2019t you dead??\u201dHer hysteria was very disturbing.Gu Shao stood up and stood in front of Lin Xi, shielding her.Song Kexin, at this time, lost consciousness and collapsed.All of a sudden, the entire Lin family plunged into chaos.***Zhang Cui came over at this point.Seeing that her daughter had passed out, she ran up anxiously to check on her. But she was stopped by Xu Jiaofeng. Song Kexin was helped upstairs by two servants plus the medical assistant as home.Zhang Cui looked back over at the direction of the living room.\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d She only came a little bit late. Whatever had happened?Zhang Cui looked over at her son-in-law then at Gu Shao, whom she did not recognize, and got a pretty good idea.This man was most likely Lin Xi\u2019s birth father. The bad guy whom her daughter had run into back in the days and impregnated her.Zhang Cui was not happy with Gu Shao. Nevertheless, as Gu Shao didn\u2019t look like some pushover, she decided it was best to not say anything.What she didn\u2019t understand was that: It was not a bad thing if someone wanted to take Lin Xi away. How did things get blow up, to a point that her daughter had passed out?\u201cSo you are Lin Xi\u2019s birth father, right? I heard you are here to transfer out her household register?\u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem with her leaving with you and you can be a father to her. Unfortunately, we had just transferred out Lin Xi\u2019s household register two days ago.\u201dGu Shao frowned when he heard that. \u201cWhere did you have it transferred out to?\u201d\u201cA relative back at our home village.\u201d Zhang Cui wanted to get rid of Gu Shao but she wasn\u2019t lying either.Lin Xi\u2019s household register had been transferred over to the village and she had been busy with bringing over another child from her Second Uncle\u2019s place. She was still in the middle of that when she heard that Lin Xi\u2019s birth father was visiting.\u201cWhat\u2019s past was past. There\u2019s not much we can say about that. I can reach out to my relatives if you want to have Lin Xi\u2019s household register transferred. Nevertheless, I hope you an keep this matter in a downlow. This is for Lin Xi\u2019s best interest as well.\u201d More importantly, for the Lin family and her daughter\u2019s reputation.What she said made Gu Shao snickered. Was she threatening him?She wasn\u2019t going to tell him where Lin Xi\u2019s household register is located right now if he didn\u2019t agree to keep this in the downlow?As a father, he would not tell anyone about the incident and how Lin Xi came about just for the sake of protecting his child. But that didn\u2019t mean he was okay with being threatened.\u201cYou really should go check on your daughter, Madam Zhang.\u201dGu Shao said goodbye to the Lin family and left with Lin Xi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - In addition, there seemed to be a recording. (2)Lin Yize had his plan initially. He was not happy that Zhang Cui had revealed the fact that Lin Xi\u2019s household register had been transferred to Gu Shao just like that. But it was too late to stop her now.Watching the father and daughter taking off from his place, Lin Yize\u2019s fist tightened and a hint of ruthlessness flashed past his eyes.At the same time, while everyone was busy with taking are of Song Kexin, who had fainted, nobody noticed the Lin Anxin had returned home early and was hiding in a corner.***Gu Shao placed a call to Wang Wu after he got to the car.\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cGo look into the Zhang Village. I want to find out where did the transfer Lin Xi\u2019s household register to.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d replied Wang Wu.Gu Shao looked back over at Lin Xi by his side after he hung up on the phone.Lin Xi had her head lowered and had not said a word since they left the Lin family.She was thinking about what she had heard from Gu Shao earlier.She knew that the Lin family favored Lin Anxin and sided with Lin Anxin.But she had no idea about the other incidents such as using her as the bait, trying to lose her, or even trying to have her die in an accident.She was lucky that she had come out of all those unscathed.Had it not been cops and reporters who had shown up at the perfect time or that Song Kexin had recovered in the end, would she still be sitting here?The thoughts made Lin Xi felt both lucky and fear after the facts.***Gu Shao had no idea what was going through Lin Xi\u2019s mind. He thought she was sad when he saw her head lowered.Song Kexin was, after all, her birth mother. Who would not feel a thing after being hated and cursed by one\u2019s own mother that way?\u201cDon\u2019t be sad.\u201dLin Xi was focused on recalling details in the novel when she suddenly heard Gu Shao\u2019s voice coming from above her head. Then she felt weight on top of her head.It was neither too heavy nor too light. Just perfect with a sense of warmth.Was it Gu Shao\u2019s palm?Was he trying to comfort her and make her feel better?Lin Xi looked up at Gu Shao, surprised. The corners of her eyes were still a little bit red.She might be really sad in the past and wondered about why her mother didn\u2019t love her. But ever since she found out that she was in a novel that her mother and adoptive father were the male and female leads of the novel, it no longer bothered her as much nor was she sad anymore.Alright, perhaps just a little bit.Gu Shao\u2019s palm was still on her head. The warmth coming from him made her want to cry.Luckily, she was able to stop herself.Lin Xi cracked her mouth open at Gu Shao: She was not sad.The was the girl choked her tears back was difficult for one to look at.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about your household register. I\u2019ll find the family and move your household register over.\u201d Gu Shao made promises to Lin Xi.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cThank you, Dad.\u201d Lin Xi gave Gu Shao a sweet smile.***The father and daughter duo were met with Aunty Mei\u2019s concerning look when the reached home.\u201cSir, Young Miss, how did it go? Did everything go well?\u201dLin Xi gave it some thought. Not wanting to make Aunty Mei worry about her, she nodded and said, \u201cIt went alright. They had transferred out household register out previously already, to the village. All we need to do is to transfer it out from there.\u201d\u201cOh, good.\u201d Aunty Mei nodded but grumbled to herself: Exactly how much did that family dislike Lin Xi? Why else would they transfer her household register to the village? Had they not considered her education, examinations, and career in the future?\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. We will move our Xiao Xi\u2019s household register to the Gu\u2019s,\u201d said Aunty Mei.Gu Shao, abruptly, added at this time, \u201cMove under me.\u201dLin Xi was taken aback a little. She didn\u2019t quite understand the difference between the two.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - In addition, there seemed to be a recording. (3)After dinner, Lin Xi returned to her room and buried herself under her blanket.She had wanted some quiet time to herself.But a notification chime interrupted her thought process.It was from the chat group [Battle at the Summit of Tianchuang] that she thought was already \u201cdead\u201d.It was still just the three of them and the one talking was the group owner.[AAA]: Bros, what say we come up with a team name first?[AAA]: What do you think about AXL?[AAA]: Do think that is too plain? Or we can just call it Battle at the Summit of Tianchuang?Watching the group owner\u2019s monologue, Lin Xi, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dThey didn\u2019t even have a team and he wanted to come up with a team name already?[X]: Group Owner, I am just here to chat.[AAA]: Oh, hahaha, that\u2019s fine too.[AAA]: We can wait on the team name. Let\u2019s talk about the format of the competition.The competition is divided up into four different areas \u2013 environmental friendliness, medical, artificial intelligence, and future technology.[AAA]: I have an idea in the medical area today \u2013 CNC (computer numerical control) Telemedicine. Meaning to rely on initial scanning technology in obtaining information about the patient and pathogen. Such information will then be sent back and compared with existing data in the database. The patient\u2019s status will be evaluated from the terminal and the most scientifically reasonable treatment options will be provided. Finally, administer precise medications on the patient\u2019s end. Of course, as a redundancy, we can have a treatment simulation before pushing it to the patient\u2019s end.[AAA]: I have given it some thoughts. We can reference Xingrui\u2019s pet-feeding system on the design of the control chip, except more complicated. I had started on it a little.He tossed a complicated-looking blue print into the chat group.Lin Xi finished reading the messages from [AAA] and then at the design blue print that she didn\u2019t quite understand. She was a little surprised. She had assumed that he was just a hack but he actually came across as pretty professional.[AAA]: So what do you think? @all[X]: Will we also need a huge medical database to back this up?[AAA]: Bro! I knew you\u2019d get me![X]: If that\u2019s the case, should we have an independent storage space for the data? And we can also increase the channels of data transfer in order to increase the efficiency?Lin Xi wasn\u2019t too certain. She could only understand a small portion of the design draft.[AAA]: Is this what you are talking about?[AAA]: Can you circle the location on the drawing?[X]: Yes.[AAA]: Good job, Bro! That\u2019s a wonderful suggestion![AAA]: Anything else? Anything else? Keep going.[AAA] was quite pleasantly surprised. He thought she was just a rando to make up headcount but she really seemed to get this and might even be quite good at it.Had she known what he was thinking, Lin Xi would have told him that: You overthought it. She merely read some books on it and had a general idea.That being said, Lin Xi still offered some of her insights.[X]: From the user\u2019s end, we might be able to tag on capturing of expressions, neurosensing, or something along that line that that would provide more detailed information. That ought to help the terminal in providing more precise analysis\u2026The group owner didn\u2019t respond for quite a while after Lin Xi\u2019s comment.A whole minute later.[AAA]: You in the medical field, Bro?[X]: No.Lin Xi felt a little intimidated.[AAA]: That\u2019s a great suggestion. I\u2019ll go add it in in a little while!***The two chatted about some more details.[AAA]: Oh, right, I have been doing all the talking. Do you have any other ideas, Bro? Maybe in some of the other areas? If you have any good ideas, we don\u2019t have to go with this one.Mainly, he wanted to see how strong this X truly was.Lin Xi didn\u2019t know what was on his mind. She thought about it some and replied.[X]: I thought about it some but they weren\u2019t very mature ideas.[AAA]: Do share.[X]: For environmental friendliness, can we integrate the current energy saving techniques and, using scientific central control technology, control the main energy-saving methods and combination modes under different conditions at different times.[X] As for artificial Intelligence, what I can come up with is a companion-style smart system. We will not finalize all of the settings in the beginning. Contrarily, we will retain and allocate a portion of the system for learning. The smart system will adapt and perfect itself according to the users\u2019 specific habits\u2026Lin Xi\u2019s idea did not involve the technology side at all but it was very do-able. And they were great ideas![AAA] responded with: Those are awesome ideas!Even [Lin], who had been offline, popped up.[Lin]: Both ideas are quite good. I think it\u2019s worth giving them a try.[AAA]: Oh mi! The person who had been missing in action showed up.[Lin]: I just didn\u2019t want to listen to your rambling is all.[AAA]: Brother X, you got anything else? Something in the future technology area, perhaps?[X]: No\u2026Truth was, Lin Xi didn\u2019t have a good grasp on what future technology really was. She had looked it up online before but had yet to find any good definition of it.They chatted for a little longer before Lin Xi closed out of the chatting application.[X]: We will chat next time.[AAA]: Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?Lin Xi, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d To work on her English assignment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - In addition, there seemed to be a recording. (4)Seeing that Lin Xi had logged off, [AAA] was a little bored. He switched to private chat and stated bragged to [Lin] on this amazing teammate that he had picked up.[AAA]: What do you think, eh? He\u2019s amazing, right?[Lin], for once, gave a very definitive answer: Not bad at all.[AAA]: Hahaha, of course. It was me who recruited him. I am very confident about this competition![AAA]: Speaking of, when are you returning anyway?[Lin]: Day after tomorrow.[AAA]: Oh shoot, for real? I thought it will be at least another two months before you return.[Lin]: I have something important to attend to.If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he wasn\u2019t able to get tickets for today or tomorrow, he wished he could be on his way back right now.[AAA] did not quite understand what was this important thing that his good friend was speaking of. He was baffled by the complacent emoji that [Lin] had added at the time: What was he so complacent about? Was he controlled by someone?***Over on the other side, Wang Wu had found out news about Lin Xi\u2019s household register.\u201cMiss Xiao Xi\u2019s household register had been transferred by Zhang Cui under a family by the name of Zhang Youfu. Zhang Youfu\u2019s father is a distance uncle of Zhang Cui. As they were distance relatives, they were able to transfer her household register over.\u201cI have already sent over the information on this Zhang Youfu.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d replied Gu Shao.\u201cIn addition.\u201d Wang Wu paused then said, \u201cI have also found out some about what had happened to Miss when she was over at Zhang Qiang\u2019s place previously.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cZhang Qiang and Zhang Cui are not technically related. They merely resided in the same village and are acquaintances of each other. Zhang Cui left the same day after she dropped Miss off. Zhang Qiang tried to\u2026 \u201cWang Wu tried to come up with a way to put it that would be more acceptable to Gu Shao. Maybe something a little more subtle.\u201cViolate Miss.\u201dHaving heard that, Gu Shao\u2019s eyes turned cold immediately.He didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. He didn\u2019t look any different but anyone who knew him well would know this: He was very angry right now.Wang Wu, \u201cJudging from the time, Miss escaped out of Zhang Qiang\u2019s place, ran all the way to the entrance to the village then came straight here.\u201cIn addition, there seemed to have a recording\u2026\u201d\u201cA recording\u201d? Gu Shao frowned deeply.\u201cYes,\u201d replied Wang Wu but didn\u2019t know how to elaborate on that.Pondering over it some more, Wang Wu said again, \u201cAs Zhang Village was relatively isolated, most of the information that we were able to obtain came from Zhang Qiang slipping on his own or description from other villager09pos. It will be difficult to reconstruct exactly what had happened.\u201dAs it turned out, after Lin Xi had taken off, Zhang Qiang worried that Lin Xi would file charges against him so he dared not tell people that she was gone. He would tell others that he had her locked up whenever people asked.Nevertheless, Zhang Qiang went to a banquet one day and was mocked that he had no money and no skill and couldn\u2019t even get himself a wife.Zhang Qiang, having too much to drink, when mocked, rebutted under the influence of alcohol, \u201cWhat do you know? Who said I can\u2019t find myself a wife? I had high standards in the past. Look, Zhang Cui just sent one to me!\u201dMost villagers had already learned that Zhang Cui had brought a child to Zhang Village and dropped her off at Zhang Qiang\u2019s place. What they didn\u2019t know was whether the girl was intended to be his daughter or his wife.Now that she was over at Zhang Qiang\u2019s place, supposed she could be his wife.They just didn\u2019t think such a good deal would have fallen on Zhang Qiang\u2019s lap.Zhang Qiang\u2019s head got bigger when others looked at him with envy. He started bragging again.\u201cShe\u2019s not like women from the village. You have no idea what a girl from the city is like. Her skin was white like tofu and tender like you can squeeze water out of her. When she serve you, I\u2019ve only got one word, very comfortable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s two words.\u201dSome troublemakers started getting rowdy when they heard Zhang Qiang\u2019s words.\u201cIf she\u2019s that\u2019s good, it\u2019s very wrong of you to hide her inside the house.\u201d\u201cRight? You should bring her out so we can meet her one day.\u201d\u201cForget about one day. Let\u2019s just head over to his place in a little while.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Was that why she was fawning over him? (1)The commotion from the others made Zhang Qiang realized that he had gone overboard with the bragging. The person was gone already. How was he going to show these people anything? Not to mention that he still remembered what Lin Xi had said about pressing charges against him.Zhang Qiang was half way sobered up instantly. He was, however, still feeling a little dizzy.\u201cWhat is there to see? You want to get arrested?\u201d Zhang Qiang shouted and grumbled, \u201cI will be done for if she brings the recording to the cops\u2026\u201dThe crowd didn\u2019t really understand the second part of what he said.What he said was unclear. Throwing in the fact that Zhang Qiang was drunk, the others only assumed that he was just rambling and nobody paid it much attention.***\u201cThat\u2019s all we were able to get for now. So far we have no idea what is this recording that they were referring to,\u201d said Wang Wu over the phone.After listening to Wang Wu\u2019s report, Gu Shao lowered his eyes. Reflexively, he recalled the audio document on Lin Xi\u2019s cellphone named \u201cevidence\u201d.\u201cKeep digging,\u201d said Gu Shao before he hung up.The study fell back into silence.As though hesitated for a long time, Gu Shao finally picked up his phone again and dialed a different number.\u201cZou Hua.\u201d He was one of Gu Shao\u2019s old acquaintances and currently NTN Technology Center\u2019s information technology expert.\u201cSomething\u2019s the matter, Lao Gu? It is late.\u201d Please don\u2019t tell him he needed some work done right now.While Zou Hua was feeling nervous, Gu Shao asked in a low voice, \u201cHow long will it take to capture a certain message in a mobile device?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not difficult at all. If you have the device number or the ip, no time at all,\u201d said Zou Hua.\u201cThat\u2019s normally speaking, though. If the device was set to \u2018do not access\u2019, then it will take a longer time.\u201d\u201cHow long?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cWell. That\u2019s not a matter of technology. Mostly it\u2019s a matter of whether it is legal to obtain this data.\u201dGu Shao\u2019s eyes flickered a little. \u201cWell, what if we are capturing the data while it is being synced between two devices?\u201dZou Hua paused a little and said, \u201cNow you are talking about a loophole. That\u2019s the wild, wild west right now. Theoretically, data being synced will be stored for three days. It will be possible to capture this data within these three days.\u201dNevertheless, what was it that Gu Shao wanted to look into? To have him reaching out to an expert like himself\u2026That was what was going through Zou Hua\u2019s after he had ended the call.At this very moment, Zou Hua received a string of ip numbers on his cellphone.***On the other side.Wang Wu was summoned over to the Gu family again after was done with his reporting.Inside the study of the Gu residence, Old Mr. Gu, sitting in front of the desk, looked progressively more unhappy.BAM!Before Wang Wu was even done, he saw Old Mr. Gu slammed his purple clay thermal cup onto the desk.\u201cWhat is wrong with this Lin family?!\u201cTheir child is a child but our Xixi is not one?\u201d Old Mr. Gu was enraged.\u201cNobody is forcing them to like her. Our Xixi doesn\u2019t need them to like her. But couldn\u2019t they have just sent her our way if they didn\u2019t like her? Why did they keep Xixi there to suffer?\u201cI suspect they are all bad people and wanted to torture her purposefully. Then that\u2019s the child\u2019s birth mother. Don\u2019t even get me started on her. And that grandmother. Hrm. None of them are good people!\u201cAnd they tried to send our Xixi to be raised in a village? What the heck was that?!\u201dOld Mr. Gu got angrier as he talked.Wang Wu, facing the angry Old Mr. Gu, lowered his head slightly and wiped away his cold sweat. This was the first time he saw Old Mr. Gu talked so much and looking so emotional.That ought to give him an idea of how angry Old Mr. Gu, who had been very high up in status all these years, was.And he only related to Old Mr. Gu the portions that had been filtered and approved by Gu Shao.Old Mr. Gu only knew that little Miss Xi had not been happy while living with the Lin family and that the Lin family played favoritism with their children. Had Old Mr. Gu knew about everything, he would most likely be putting a team together to take out the Lin family right about now.\u201cGo look into that Lin family and their company. Pay particular attention on what they might have done that were illegal. Leave no rocks unturned.\u201d Old Mr. Gu gave the order looking extremely angry.Wang Wu was taken aback a little and replied, \u201cSir is already on these.\u201dUpon hearing that, Old Mr. Gu glared at Wang Wu, \u201cHow is that the same?\u201dGu Shao would take care of things from his end but him, as the Grandpa, must do his fair share as well.That night, everybody had their own thoughts on their minds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Was that why she was fawning over him? (2)The next morning.Lin Xi was actually slightly surprised pleasantly when she saw that Gu Shao was still home.\u201cGood morning, Dad.\u201d She greeted him in her standard way.\u201cCome have breakfast.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dLin Xi walked over to the dining table and, by then, Aunty Mei had already brough breakfast out for her.Noticing that Gu Shao hasn\u2019t been eating, Lin Xi was a bit surprised \u2013 was he waiting for her?\u201cLet\u2019s eat, Dad,\u201d said Lin Xi as she handed a pair of chopsticks over to Gu Shao.Gu Shao took the chopsticks and seemingly grunted in acknowledgement.\u201cWe have already located the family where your household register resides,\u201d said Gu Shao. Then, pausing a little, he added, \u201cI will go and have it transferred over.\u201dLin Xi was happy when she heard that. \u201cI\u2019ll come with.\u201dNoticing that Gu Shao was looking over at her, she lowered her voice and asked, \u201cCan I?\u201dSchool doesn\u2019t officially start till next Monday. As such, Lin Xi didn\u2019t have a lot going on this next couple of days.Looking at the anticipation and determination on Lin Xi\u2019s face, Gu Shao nodded slightly. \u201cSure.\u201d\u2013 \u2013 Yay!Lin Xi rejoiced to herself.She had no idea why she was so excited. She just wanted to go with. Most likely because she couldn\u2019t wait to be rid of the Lin family and the control of the novel.\u201cAre we going to day?\u201d asked Lin Xi.\u201cI have something to take care of today,\u201d said Gu Shao. Then, noticing the disappointment that flashed through Lin Xi\u2019s eyes, he added, \u201cWe will go tomorrow.\u201dThere were a few things that he needed to confirm today.As though something had occurred to him, Gu Shao looked over at Lin Xi again.\u201cZhang Cui had sent you over to the place of someone by the name of Zhang Qiang before?\u201d asked Gu Shao.Lin Xi\u2019s hand that was holding onto a spoon stiffened a little. She nodded and said, \u201cYes, that Zhang Qiang was a distant relative of grand\u2026 Zhang Cui.\u201d\u201cHow did you leave?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I overheard that they were going to leave me there so I booked a car online ahead of time. I ran away after my grandmother had left. I ran all the way to the entrance of the village and rode the car to you,\u201d said Lin Xi, not noticing that her eyes darted around some as she talked.Gu Shao, nevertheless, noticed that.\u201cAll went very well, really,\u201d said Lin Xi softly as she ate her porridge.\u201cWere you bullied?\u201d asked Gu Shao again.His tone was calm but, if one was to listen to it carefully, would be able to tell the suppressed anger in it.Lin Xi shook her head.After a little while, she looked up and at Gu Shao and gave him a casual smile. \u201cNobody can bully me.\u201d\u2013 \u2013 Lin Xi did not tell him the entire story. It was obviously that there were other parts that she didn\u2019t want to bring up.The girl in front of him appeared to be optimistic and carefree but, in reality, she was very guarded against everything deep down inside.Even when it came to her own father.That might a mechanism that she had adopted in order to protect herself from living under the Lin\u2019s roof.Gu Shao had noticed it but he didn\u2019t point it out, nor did he continue down that line of questioning.***Seeing that Gu Shao had dropped the subject, Lin Xi let out a sigh of relief. She thought she had muddled through it.She wasn\u2019t asking for much. She wanted to break free from the Lin family and live calmly till she was of age. She didn\u2019t want to cause a lot of trouble, or bring about troubles for Gu Shao.All she needed was for him to give her a household register so she could live safely till adulthood.Lin Xi ate her breakfast quietly.Something occurred to her all of a sudden and she glanced over at Gu Shao.\u201cDad.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201dLin Xi was looking at him with a seriousness and a desire for knowledge. That reminded him of the question that she had asked him in the car the day before. The corners of Gu Shao\u2019s eyes twitched.Gu Shao gestured Lin Xi to carry on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - Was that why she was fawning over him? (3)\u201cWhat is future technology?\u201d asked Lin Xi.The term was so broad that Lin Xi wasn\u2019t able to find a good definition online.Hearing Lin Xi\u2019s question, Gu Shao paused and answered her with a question, \u201cWhat do you think future technology represents?\u201d\u201cEm\u2026 technologies that are not available currently but will appear in the future?\u201d asked Lin Xi uncertainly. She understood the literal meaning of the words but she didn\u2019t have a good grasp of the concept.\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said Gu Shao. He then added, \u201cFuture technology represents a type of technology, but it is not limited to a specific area of science and technology. Simply put, any current technology that could affect the future development direction can be considered as future technology. Future technology can also include technologies that will arise in the future basing on current speculations or planning\u2026\u201dGu Shao\u2019s explanation was very concise and he provided Lin Xi with some specific examples.Lin Xi listened to him attentively and nodded from time to time.When he was done talking, Gu Shao looked at the girl with her widened eyes, raised his brows, and asked, \u201cYou get it now?\u201d\u201cMmhmm. Mmhmm.\u201d Lin Xi nodded. There was undisguised respect in her eyes.Gu Shao found that somewhat humorous.\u201cWhy did you ask about this all of a sudden?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cOh, I came across it online and was curious what it meant,\u201d explained Lin Xi.\u2013 She was certainly studious.That was what Gu Shao thought.Recalling Lin Xi\u2019s scores during her entrance examinations to HSAU, a shred of pride arose in Gu Shao that even he had failed to notice.***Gu Shao left to head over to NTN Technology Center after breakfast.Over on this side, Lin Xi suddenly received text messages from [AAA] not long after Gu Shao had left.Specifically, he had already sent over more than 10 messages.Yesterday, before she logged off, she had approved his friend\u2019s request.[AAA]: Bro X, about the ideas that you have shared yesterday. I thought them through last night and there are totally doable.[AAA]: I worked on some initial designs basing on what you have said. Take a look and tell me if that\u2019s inline with your thoughts.[AAA] sent over three pictures after this message. Two of them were based on Lin Xi\u2019s two ideas from the day before and the final one was his edited design on the smart medical system with Lin Xi\u2019s suggestions integrated.[AAA]: So? What do you think? Is it like that?[AAA]: Let me tell you. Your ideas are awesome.[AAA]: We are only at the initial design phase. We can talk over them before we make modifications.***Lin Xi had barely finish reading the 10 plus messages when [AAA]: sent over another one: Bro X? Bruh? Darling? Precious? Did you see the messages that I have sent you?[AAA]: Bro, can you please respond back to me if you have seen them?[AAA]: Don\u2019t tell me you are still in bed.Looking at the bombardment of texts, the corners of Lin Xi\u2019s lips twitched. She somewhat regretted approving his friend\u2019s request yesterday. How could she rectify that?Lin Xi responded with. [I\u2019m here.][AAA]: Hahaha, you are finally getting back to me.[AAA]: I thought you are about to give up on this teammate of yours.Having said that, he even added a \u201cWHEW\u201d emoji.[AAA]: Have you had a chance to look at my designs? If you have, let\u2019s talk about them.Even though he had been up all night long, Big Brother A was still high like he was on drugs.[X]: Yes, I\u2019ve looked at them.Lin Xi wondered how she could remind him that they were not teammates.[X]: Chat Owner, I did not plan on joining the competition. What I said last night were just my very initial ideas. You are welcome to adopt them if you feel that they will work for you.Her mind was clear and her wordings subtle.That should work, right?Thought Lin Xi to herself.On the other hand, [AAA] was stunned when he saw the msg from Lin Xi.[AAA]: ! ! ![AAA]: Whatever happened to our agreement to battle at the summit of Tianchuang? It\u2019s only been one night and you are just going to pull your pants up and pretended that nothing had happened?Lin Xi, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dWhen did we have this agreement? And, whatever did it mean by pulled up my pants and pretended that nothing had happened?Before Lin Xi could respond, he sent over more messages:[Please don\u2019t abandon me. We can\u2019t do it without you.][Trust me on this. We don\u2019t have a large team but we are all elites. I\u2019m am sure we will win a prize.][I\u2019ll even let you be the team captain, alright?]\u2013 \u2013 She didn\u2019t want to be the team captain.Thought Lin Xi.She had thought the team leader was like chatty person but turned out he was also one who was persistent.Lin Xi wasn\u2019t quite sure how to handle [AAA] who was completely out of character after just one night.While Lin Xi was debating whether to block him in a friendly manner, [AAA] sent over another text: 1 million yuan! You can have the entire 1 million yuan after we get the prize money!He only joined the competition for the development or referral rights. That way he could kickstart his own workshop. The money was secondary.Lin Xi\u2019s finger stopped 2 mm above \u201cblock\u201d. What should I do? I am very tempted.[X]: Let me think about it.Perhaps she could join as a backup team member and not take up an actual spot?She didn\u2019t need all 1 million yuan either. 100,000 yuan would be good enough.The thought of coming into wealth made Lin Xi a very happy girl.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - Was that why she was fawning over him? (4)On the other side, over at NTN Technology Center, Gu Shao was far less happy.He didn\u2019t head to his office when he arrived at NTN Technology Center but went straight to Zuo Hua\u2019s office.\u201cYou got anything?\u201d asked Gu Shao as soon as he walked inside.\u201cYes. There is an audio file. Here you go.\u201d Zuo Hua handed a USB drive to Gu Shao as he talked.Out of respect for his good friend and professionalism, Zuo Hua did not listen to the audio file.Out of curiosity, however, he did scan over the content through certain means. Somewhat similar to virus scan in documents.Zuo Hua was surprised that he did not get any hits on any sensitive words.\u201cThank you,\u201d said Gu Shao. He then left with the USB drive.Looking at Gu Shao\u2019s back, Zuo Hua couldn't help but mumbled to himself. \u201cI am done for. Now I am even more curious than before.\u201d What could be so important that his good friend / boss would value so much that he\u2019d reach out to him to take care of in the middle of the night?***Over on this side, Gu Shao had already returned to his office.Inserting the USB drive, Gu Shao clicked open the only audio fileThe first thing that he heard was noises of something hitting the ground.Then it was a girl\u2019s high and clear voice. It was fearful.\u201cYou\u2026 \u2026\u201dGu Shao\u2019s hand, resting on the mouse, tightened.He paused the audio playback instantly.Wang Wu was standing in a corner of the office, holding onto a portion of information on the Lin family and was about to report it to him.Gu Shao looked over at Wang Wu, \u201cOut.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Wang Wu responded and exited the office.***Gu Shao clicked play again when he was alone in his office.The girl\u2019s voice resumed.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201dThe voice belonged to Lin Xi.\u201cWhat am I going to do? What do you think I am going to do?\u201d It was a man\u2019s voice. \u201cYou are going to serve me. If you do a good job at serving me\u2026 \u2026\u201d\u2026 \u2026\u201cYou are lying! My grandmother said I am going to be here temporarily\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t come over\u201d, \u201cPlease don\u2019t come any closer\u201d\u2026 \u2026The recording was only too obvious. So much that one could tell what was going on from the conversation alone without needing to see the picture.Gu Shao\u2019s hand over the mouse gripped tighter and tighter.***Wang Wu waited outside of the office door and had no idea what was going on inside.All of a sudden, a loud noise coming from inside the office startled him.He listened to the noises carefully. Was Gu Shao enraged?His speculation startled even himself. He had worked for Gu Shao for years and had rarely ever seen him enraged.Even back when he was still at the Gu family and left because of that one incident, he wasn\u2019t enraged like he was right now.Especially over the last few years, his temperament had settled down more and more and had rarely ever let his emotions shown like he was right now.After a long while, Wang Wu heard Gu Shao\u2019s voice and went back inside the office.He saw the mouse that was in pieces and the half-broken keyboard on Gu Shao\u2019s desk. Wang Wu was nervous. He approached Gu Shao carefully and said, \u201cSir?\u201d\u201cIs that the information on the Lin family?\u201d asked Gu Shao, his voice cold enough to send a chill down someone\u2019s spine.\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Wang Wu handed the document over to Gu Shao.\u2013 \u2013 The Lin family started their family business from taking advantages of the differences in prices of merchandizes in different regions and was now in the transportation business. Naturally, for a company their size, there would be some issues.The limited amount of information that he had in his hand was sufficient to hurt them quite a bit.Wang Wu wisely took a few steps back after handing the document over to Gu Shao. He took a quick glance over at Gu Shao during the process.The anger on Gu Shao made Wang Wu\u2019s heart sank.Gu Shao quickly skimmed through the document and said, \u201cNot enough.\u201d\u201cKeep digging.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201dHis aura was intimidating\u2026Thought Wang Wu to himself.***That night, when Gu Shao returned home, he had already returned to his normal self.As soon as the door opened, he saw the bright smile on Lin Xi. \u201cHi Dad, you are home.\u201d\u201cPerfect timing. Grandma Mei just finished preparing dinner.\u201dGu Shao\u2019s look deepened as he looked at the girl. The girl\u2019s smile has the unique attractiveness that could only belong to someone her age. Except that, her smile made one\u2019s heart ached.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to fawn over me,\u201d said Gu Shao suddenly and calmly to Lin Xi.He was a cold person but that did not mean that he has low emotional quotient. He had been around Lin Xi for a few days now and it was obviously that she was fawning deliberately.Was that because she saw him as her only option?Or was it because she worried that he would not want her, that she would have to return to the Lin family and go through what she had again. Was that why she was fawning over him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - Looking at the girl leaning up against the car window, Gu Shao's look mellowed out. (1)Lin Xi was taken aback by Gu Shao\u2019s words. She looked at him, dumbfounded. There was surprised in her eyes.Gu Shao looked down and into her eyes. He enunciated every word, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to fawn over anyone here, not even me.\u201dLin Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFawning over?She only felt that she should be conscientious of the fact that she was living under somebody else\u2019s roof. She subconsciously wanted to make sure that Gu Shao would keep her there and that she didn\u2019t want him to find her annoying\u2026\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Lin Xi lowered her head and denied in a low voice. Her eyes, however, darted around aimlessly.Gu Shao did not comment on that. He looked at the top of Lin Xi\u2019s head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve made the promise that I will raise you. Then, out of the responsibility of a father, I will raise you and do my best to provide you with the best.\u201dIt was the first time he had said the last part of sentence. In the past, he had only planned on providing the child that came out of nowhere the mandatory living and school expenses out of responsibilities. His viewpoint, seemed to have changed a little over time.\u201cI will not treat you the same way that your birth other and adoptive father did. You won\u2019t need to worry about that.\u201d Gu Shao paused, then said, \u201cAs such, you don\u2019t need to feel like you are always walking over thin ice in this house. Nor would you need to be alarmed or worry too much. You can freely do what you want.\u201dAlbeit he had no experience or idea in child-rearing, in Gu Shao\u2019s mind, being father meant to put up with their children.Lin Xi looked at Gu Shao with surprise. She hadn\u2019t expected a cold person who rarely smiled would talk so much with her.Even though Gu Shao\u2019s tone was still very cold, but it was already enough to make Lin Xi be pleasantly surprised.\u201cThanks, Dad!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be good. And will repay you. And be nice to you.\u201d The girl\u2019s voice was soft but what she said was enough to make someone want to smile and also feel a hint of warmth.As though worried that Gu Shao would not believe her, Lin Xi added, \u201cI meant what I said.\u201dGu Shao, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d At least the girl didn\u2019t say she would buy him the best plot and hold the most expensive funeral for him this time.***Aunty Mei, watching the interaction between the father and daughter, was pleased.She had been watching Lin Xi and Gu Shao the last few days. Even though the two were father and daughter, but they acted like strangers to each other. Never mind about interactions, they barely talked to each other.On top of that, Aunty Mei could sense that Miss Xiao Xi needed some time to warm up.For now, Aunty Mei was already pleasantly surprised for a conversation like this between the father and daughter.-- Mr. Gu was learning to become a better father as well.Aunty Mei felt happy inside.In addition, not even Gu Shao himself had noticed that he was much more patience when it came to Lin Xi than he was with any one else.\u201cSir, Xiao Xi, come and have dinner. I made a lot today. They are getting cold.\u201d Aunty Mei called out to the two of them with a smile on her.***Over the dinner table, Lin Xi passed the bowl with rice and the chopsticks over to Gu Shao.Hmm. No, she wasn\u2019t fawning over him. It was just a habit that carried over from the last few days.She then sat down in front of Gu Shao.There were a lot of dishes today. There were chicken, meats, and seafood. Lin Xi was dazzled by the options.Truth was, there were always a lot of dishes ever since the arrival of Aunty Mei.Aunty Mei seemed to be very certain that Lin Xi had a terrible time when she was with the Lin family, that she had no clothes to wear and never enough food to eat. She was very determined to fatten her up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Looking at the girl leaning up against the car window, Gu Shao's look mellowed out. (2)Lin Xi was very quiet when she ate. She almost never glanced around but only keep her head lowered and eat what was in front of her.She did, however, glance over at the plate of crab sitting in front of Gu Shao from time to time.She did know when but a plate of crab suddenly appeared in front of her. Lin Xi was taken aback a little and looked up at Gu Shao.\u201cYou like this?\u201d\u201cMmhmm.\u201d Lin Xi nodded, \u201cThank\u2026 mmmm\u2026\u201dRemembering what Gu Shao had told her just a little while ago, Lin Xi finally switch the \u201cthank you\u201d out to an appreciative smile.She liked crab but she had no choice at the Lin family.Owing to Song Kexin\u2019s health problem, she could not have food that were cold in nature and Lin Anxin did not enjoy food that required so much work.It was, indeed, true that she was not like them. There was nothing in common between them.That what went through Lin Xi\u2019s mind.Gu Shao looked over at the girl who was quietly enjoying the crab. He saw her pulling out one crab from the plate first, removed the shell, pulled off the claws and the legs one by one, before she extracted and ate the meat.She\u2019d finish one first before she moved on to the next. Her actions and the steps were almost identical and she was very focused the entire time.Anyone who didn\u2019t know better would think that she was conducting some sort of advanced experiment.***Gu Shao thought that perhaps Lin Xi didn\u2019t like crab legs and didn\u2019t think much of it.But he was wrong.After she had devoured all the crab bodies that barely had any meat, Lin Xi returned to the stack of crab legs that had been \u201cforgotten\u201d.She broke off the end of the middle portion, then broken off the front portion, then poked the pointed end from the front portion inside of the middle part and the entire piece of meat from the middle part came right out.The entire process was nice and smooth.Aunty Mei smiled from one side. \u201cMiss Xiao Li is very good at this.\u201d\u201cOh, I learned it from the web,\u201d said Lin Xi reflexively. That was all she could do to \u201cget her fix\u201d.She didn\u2019t mean it any which way but Aunty Mei felt her heart ached all over again when she heard that.Noticing that Gu Shao seemed to be looking at her, Lin Xi paused a little.\u201cWould you like some, Dad?\u201d asked Lin Xi.\u201cNo, you can have them.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Xi nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t have too much of it.\u201d He seemed to recall that crab meat is cold in nature.\u201cOkay\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Shao looked away from her.After a little while, he saw the girl placing a plate of crab meat in front of him.It was a plate full of crab meat. As they were all the meat from the middle portions, they all looked to be about the same. They almost looked comical when stacked neatly on a plate.Lin Xi smiled at Gu Shao and was still chewing on the meat from the front portions of the crab legs.***Anyone who was familiar with Gu Shao would know that he was a germophobe and would never eat anything that was peeled by someone else.Nor did he know whether she had washed her hands before he came home.Nevertheless, Gu Shao picked up his chopsticks when he saw the anticipation in Lin Xi\u2019s eyes.Even Aunty Mei, who had been working for the Gu family for dozens of years, were surprised.But, came to think about it some more, they were father and daughter after all. Of course a father would never find his daughter resentful.Aunty Mei smiled secretively and, looking at the father and daughter, trying to figure out a way to complete the mission assigned to her from Old Mr. Gu.***The next morning, Gu Shao headed to Village Zhang with Lin Xi in tow.They took the same path as the one she did with her grandmother but what Lin Xi was feeling was completely different now.Looking at the girl leaning up against the car window and watching the scene flew past them with a smile on her face, even the look on Gu Shao had mellowed out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - Looking at the girl leaning up against the car window, Gu Shao's look mellowed out. (3)As Gu Shao had looked into both Zhang Village and Zhang Youfu, he had the car pulled out outside of Zhang Youfu\u2019s house after they entered the village.Quite a few individuals gathered around when they saw multiple cars pulled up in front of Zhang Youfu\u2019s house.\u201cMore people come looking for Zhang Youfu, huh?\u201d\u201cWhat car brand is this? It looks expensive.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of good happened upon Zhang Youfu\u2019s family?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Zhang Cui, right?\u201d Someone said. \u201cHer daughter married some big boss in the city. Didn\u2019t you see her coming in some fancy car every time?\u201d\u201cThat Zhang Cui was married to a gambling addict in the past and everybody said how she was so unfortunate. Look, not only was she able to lose that gambling addict after her daughter was raised, she was even able to live the life of a wealthy woman in the city,\u201d said one of the people there with the feel of jealousy seeping into their words.\u201cI heard that her man didn\u2019t really want the divorce. Her daughter was somehow able to make it happen\u2026\u2026\u201dThese people loved to gossip. Just a few sentences and one would be able to learn all about Zhang Cui\u2019s life.\u201cBut didn\u2019t Zhang Cui just come over a few days ago? Why did she come again now?\u201d mumbled someone.Zhang Cui had come over to Zhang Village a few days prior to transfer over Lin Xi\u2019s household register. She didn\u2019t want to attract too much attention so she didn\u2019t stay for very long. Only a handful of people had noticed her.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cBut, why do I feel that this is more ostentatious than normal?\u201dZhang Cui usually came in one car. This time, there were several cars.The villagers hadn\u2019t seen a lot of luxurious cars nor did they know the brand of these cars. Much like before, they just felt that these cars look even more luxurious than the ones that they had seen in the past.***Gu Shao got out of the car with Lin Xi in tow when the crowd gossiped among themselves.Noticing that it was Zhang Cui who came out of the car, they were surprised.\u201cWho\u2019s that? That\u2019s not Zhang Cui.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever seen him before.\u201d\u201cCould he be Zhang Cui\u2019s son-in-law?\u201dGu Shao had top look, top status, and even his aura was leaps and bounds ahead of an ordinary person. Many among the crowd was envious: They have daughters at home too. How come they were not able to land a son-in-law like him?By this time, those inside Zhang Youfu\u2019s house had already heard the ruckus outside and came out. They were taken aback a little when they saw Gu Shao, Lin Xi, and all the cars.\u201cAre, are you Sister Zhang Cui\u2019s son-in-law?\u201d asked Zhang Youfu uncertainly.Zhang Cui hadn\u2019t been back a lot since she had left the village nor had she ever brought Lin Yize with her. As such, Zhang Youfu only knew that Zhang Cui\u2019s son-in-law was someone of importance but he didn\u2019t know what Lin Yize looked like.As for Lin Xi.Even though Zhang Cui had transferred Lin Xi\u2019s household register under Zhang Youfu but, worried that someone would figure out Lin Xi\u2019s relationship with her daughter, she wasn\u2019t going to actually bring Lin Xi over to her cousin\u2019s place from Zhang Qiang\u2019s place.Zhang Cui had further heard rumors around the village that Zhang Qiang was going to take Lin Xi as his wife. Zhang Cui was very surprised at first and felt that that was wrong but, after she had given it more thought, that could work \u2013 when Lin Xi had Zhang Qiang\u2019s child after a few years, she would have ties to this place and would decide to stick around here. That way her daughter and her son-in-law would have nothing else to worry about.By then, if Zhang Qiang was willing, they could then transfer Lin Xi\u2019s household register under Zhang Qiang. Everything would work out perfectly.As such, even though Lin Xi was now Zhang Youfu\u2019s \u201csixth daughter\u201d on paper, he had no idea what Lin Xi looked like.Naturally, he had no idea who this pretty girl in front of him was.Could she be Song Kexin\u2019s daughter?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Was Gu Shao heading over to Zhang Qiang\u2019s place? (1)Gu Shao didn\u2019t have too much of an expression on him this entire time. His face, however, dropped when he saw Zhang Youfu starting at Lin Xi, who was standing next to him.\u201cNo,\u201d said Gu Shao.\u201cBut my purpose of visit has something to do with Zhang Cui.\u201d\u201cOh, do come inside then.\u201d Zhang Youfu had no idea who Gu Shao was but his instinct told him that he was someone that he couldn\u2019t afford to offend.***Lin Xi walked in next to Gu Shao.Even though both houses were in the same village, Zhang Youfu\u2019s house was much better than Zhang Qiang\u2019s. Not only was this house newly built, it was also much cleaner than Zhang Qiang\u2019s place.Zhang Youfu invited Gu Shao inside the house and offered him tea.There were many people inside of Zhang Youfu\u2019s house and they all stood to one side and peeked over at Gu Shao and Lin Xi.\u201cYou are a friend of Zhang Cui\u2019s? What brought you here today?\u201d asked Zhang Youfu. He had reflexively lowered his hand in front of Gu Shao.Gu Shao didn\u2019t waste any time either. He said, point blank, \u201cZhang Cui transferred a child\u2019s household register under your family a few days ago, right?\u201d\u201cI am the child\u2019s father and I am here to transfer her household register out.\u201dEverybody at Zhang Youfu\u2019s house were stunned by what Gu Shao had said.They looked from Gu Shao to Lin Xi: Is this the girl?Zhang Cui told them that a daughter of one of Song Kexin\u2019s husband\u2019s relative had gone mad and it was untreatable. They didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed so they have sent to her the village.But this girl in front of them looked just fine.Besides, didn\u2019t words on the street had it that she was locked up by Zhang Qiang?Zhang Youfu was very baffled and, right at that moment, Zhang Youfu\u2019s wife jumped out and said, \u201cHi, Boss, I think you had it wrong. Zhang Cui did transfer a child over to our family a couple of days ago but that was a child from a friend of Zhang Cui\u2019s. I don\u2019t think we are talking about the same girl.\u201dZhang Youfu\u2019s wife had no idea what Zhang Cui had up her sleeves. Nevertheless, Zhang Cui had promised to send them money annually as long as the child\u2019s household register was under their family.No fool would turn down a deal this sweet. They didn\u2019t even need to do anything or to feed her.Zhang Youfu nodded as well. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Zhang Cui was the one who came to us and we have no way to prove your relationship with Zhang Cui or whether you are telling the truth. We can\u2019t just transfer the household register out just like that.\u201cIf you want it transferred out, had Zhang Cui come.\u201dAs soon as Zhang Youfu had said that, his wife interrupted him right away. \u201cNot even if Zhang Cui is here. So what if you said you are the girl\u2019s father? I can say that you are not! She\u2019s already under our family. By law, she is one of us. We get to decide whether to transfer her out.\u201dSure, we can transfer her out. But not without more money.That was the plan that was going through Zhang Youfu\u2019s wife\u2019s mind, obviously trying to muck things out.Gu Shao snickered and his eyes turned colder.\u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t need to prove to you whether I am or am not Lin Xi\u2019s father.\u201cSecondly, if you want to talk about law, then let\u2019s talk about the law.\u201d Gu Shao paused before carrying on. \u201cLin Xi is my child. She has nothing to do with your family from the blood or relationship perspective. You have just transferred an unrelated child\u2019s household register to under your family and even had her locked up in the village without the permission of her parents. I can press charges for kidnapping at any given time.\u201dGu Shao\u2019s voice was calm but his aura allowed no room for disagreement.As such, his half facts were able to make Zhang Youfu\u2019s family turn pale.\u201cAiya, you can\u2019t just go around accusing us like this. Zhang Cui was the one who transferred the child over. That has nothing to do with us. And it was Zhang Qiang who had her locked up\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Youfu\u2019s wife quickly rebutted. A group of traffickers had operated around a few villages in the area. It was said that the penalty was very severe.Gu Shao carried on expressionlessly. \u201cYou can argue about your involvement in court. That being said, do you think the judge will be more inclined to listen to you or me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Was Gu Shao heading over to Zhang Qiang\u2019s place? (2)When Gu Shao was making threats and lies seriously, he looked exactly like Lin Xi when she was bluffing Zhang Qiang.\u201cYou have a son studying at an university in City A, right? And he\u2019s graduating this year? It seemed he had secured a job as well. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019d lose his job when they found out that his parents have criminal records.\u201dHearing that Gu Shao even knew about their son, Zhang Youfu\u2019s wife collapsed onto the floor.Gu Shao went on to say, \u201cThis is me trying to reason with you right now. If you don\u2019t want to be reasonable, I am not above taking other actions.\u201dEven without any expressions, Gu Shao\u2019s aura was enough to intimidate others.Her only son was the center of her universe. He had worked hard and perhaps would even have a future like that of Zhang Cui\u2019s daughter and then she would be able to enjoy good times in the city. She wasn\u2019t going to let this threaten that.Zhang Youfu\u2019s wife was frantic now. \u201cNo, don\u2019t, don\u2019t sue us. This was all Zhang Cui. We just thought we are helping a relative out. We don\u2019t know anything about this.\u201d\u201cExactly, if you want to transfer the child\u2019s household register out then go right ahead. We aren\u2019t going to stop you\u2026 \u2026\u201dSeeing how Zhang Youfu and his family were panicking in front of them, Lin Xi turned to look at Gu Shao. She suddenly felt that he had became much bigger and taller. It looked like she had a lot of room for improvement on the path of bluffing.Now that Zhang Youfu and his family were willing to cooperate, Gu Shao had no reason to give them a hard time. He had Wang Wu brought with him members of this family along with their household registers over to the police station in the village to transfer Lin Xi\u2019s household register out.Zhang Youfu was still begging Gu Shao on his way out to not press charges for kidnapping.***Wang Wu was very efficient and he was able to quickly get the printout confirming that Lin Xi\u2019s household register had been transferred out.When all was done, Gu Shao and Lin Xi took off.Lin Xi hadn\u2019t expected that what she thought was a very sticky situation would be handled so simply and smoothly by her father.After the father and daughter had departed, the crowd who had scattered gathered again.\u201cWhat was that anyway? That aura was scary as heck.\u201d\u201cWho knows. I think I heard Zhang Youfu\u2019s wife crying inside. Do you think Zhang Cui and her family were in trouble in the city?\u201d\u201cWho knows. We should go.\u201dOutside of Zhang Youfu\u2019s house that was bustling just a while ago went quiet all of a sudden.***On this end, after departing from Zhang Youfu\u2019s house, the chauffeur pulled over next to a playground near the entrance of the village.\u201cIs this good, Sir?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Gu Shao. Then, looking at Lin Xi, he said to her, \u201cWait for me in the car.\u201dUpon hearing that, Lin Xi looked baffled, \u201cWhat else do you need to take care of, Dad?\u201d Did he forget something at Zhang Youfu\u2019s?Lin Xi looked left and right. That did not appear to be the case.Gu Shao did not elaborate. He merely added, \u201cYou can go walk around if you are bored but don\u2019t to too far. I will be back shortly.\u201d\u201cCan I come with you?\u201d Lin Xi was about to get out of the car.\u201cBe good.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dLin Xi filled in the second part of what Gu Shao was saying, \u201cIf you are not a good girl then I don\u2019t want you anymore. I will leave you here.\u201d As such, Lin Xi curled up inside the side.Watching Gu Shao as he got into the other car and the car took off in the direction of the village, Lin Xi frowned deeply.Suddenly, an idea occurred to her. Was Gu Shao heading over to Zhang Qiang\u2019s place?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - \"You look so cool earlier, Dad!\" (1)Lin Xi was right. Gu Shao did go look for Zhang Qiang.At this moment, the door to Zhang Qiang\u2019s place was shut tight. It looked just like usual from the outside when, in reality, 6 \u2013 7 well-trained bodyguards were inside of Zhang Qiang\u2019s yard, keeping Zhang Qiang inside.The head of them opened up the door for Gu Shao when he arrived.The name of this man is Wang Lu.Much like Wang Wu, he, too, was an employee of the Gu family. The difference was that Wang Wu helped take care of the open businesses; whereas, Wang Lu, take care of the most subtle ones.Under normal situation, Wang Lu\u2019s service would not be required unless it was something very important or special.\u201cSir,\u201d said Wang Lu to Gu Shao wish his head lowered.\u201cWhere is he?\u201d asked Gu Shao. His voice cold.\u201cHe\u2019s inside, Sir,\u201d said Wang Lu as he pointed in the direction of the main house.Gu Shao nodded and walked inside.***There were two bodyguards inside the main house and Zhang Qiang was cowering in a corner, looking fearful. One could tell from the panic on his face that he had no idea what he had done or whom he had offended.See Gu Shao, Zhang Qiang trembled even more violently \u2013\u2013 He didn\u2019t know who Gu Shao was but, judging from Gu Shao\u2019s aura and the attitude of the others toward him, he figured he was the boss.Zhang Qiang gulped.\u201cUgh. Who, who are you?\u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201dZhang Qiang might be uneducated and not very worldly but he could still tell that the group of people, especially the one standing in front of him right now, was bad news.Looking back over at Gu Shao, Zhang Qiang dared not meet his eyes. He stuttered, \u201cBo, Boss. I am just a man in a village and had never committee any crimes. I am sure there has been some sort of a mistake. You\u2026 \u2026\u201dGu Shao interrupted Zhang Qiang and said calmly to him, \u201cI am the father of Lin Xi.\u201dLin Xi?Zhang Qiang was taken aback a little. \u201cYou are referring to the girl that Zhang Cui had dropped off a while back?\u201dThe girl who had frightened him so much that he dared not even mention her name left a lasting impression with Zhang Qiang.When Gu Shao did not deny it, Zhang Qiang knew that he was right and also why he was here. He panicked.\u201cOh, so you are the father of that girl.\u201d Shivering, Zhang Qiang still tried to put on an innocent look. \u201cShe only stopped by with Zhang Cui that one day and took off the same day.\u201dExcept that she didn\u2019t just leave, she escaped.\u201cIf you are looking for her, Boss. You really are at the wrong place. Lin Xi is not here. Perhaps you can go talk to Zhang Cui?\u201dHaving said that, he noticed the cold look on Gu Shao and his lack of intention of letting him go. Zhang panicked even more. He quickly added, \u201cReally. Don\u2019t listen to the rumors in town. I didn\u2019t have to locked up. You can look. Please, feel free to look around.\u201dGu Shao looked over at Zhang Qiang and said coldly, \u201cDo you really think you will be talking to me like this if you still have my daughter locked up?\u201dZhang Qiang processed that a little and figured out the meaning of Gu Shao\u2019s words: So he knew that Lin Xi was not here at his place. He wasn\u2019t here to look for the girl.\u201cThen what is it that you want?\u201d asked Zhang Qiang, still trying to play dumb.He heard Gu Shao saying to him in a very severe tone, \u201cTo settle our scores, over the harm that you had caused my daughter.\u201dPerhaps Gu Shao\u2019s attitude right now was too overly intimidating, Zhang Qiang started to tremble immediately. He thought to himself: This was Lin Xi\u2019s father. Did Lin Xi run to her father after she ran off and told him about what had happened here and now he was here to settle the scores?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - \"You look so cool earlier, Dad!\" (2)Frantic, Zhang Qiang quickly explained himself, \u201cI, I, I did not hurt her.\u201cI am telling the truth. Zhang Cui was the one who brought her over. It had nothing to do with me.\u201d Zhang Qiang wanted to place all the blame on Zhang Cui.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t very specific so I thought she sent the girl over to be my wife. That was the only reason that I, I attempted to\u2026 \u2026\u201d Noticing Gu Shao\u2019s long face, Zhang Qiang stopped himself mid-sentence. \u201cBut I failed.\u201d\u201cShe sprayed some pepper water on me and brought me down with some sort of electrical devices. I was stuck to the door when I regained consciousness.\u201cIt was that, that door.\u201d Zhang Qiang pointed at the door and said, \u201cI am not lying. You can still see the marks left by the benches.\u201dSure enough, there were some marks on the door. Left by the first strong men who had \u201csaved\u201d Zhang Qiang and got him down.\u201cI couldn\u2019t even move when I was stuck there. I wasn\u2019t even able to touch a single strand of hair of hers.\u201dHearing what Zhang Qiang was saying, Wang Lu and the others were finally able to fill in the missing part in Wang Wu\u2019s report.They just hadn\u2019t expected the young miss to be so\u2026 uh, mighty.\u201cI swear I am telling the truth. I was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have evil ideas like that. But, Boss, your daughter was safe. So please let me go.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see you letting my daughter go when she was here,\u201d said Gu Shao in a deep voice. Recalling the content of the recording, Gu Shao\u2019s fists tightened.Zhang Qiang recoiled a little from fear when he saw that. \u201cHey, don\u2019t, don\u2019t get any ideas. I am not afraid of you. It\u2019s illegal for you to kill me.\u201dZhang Qiang didn\u2019t know much about the law, but he did know that murdering someone is illegal.\u201cThat\u2019s why we will make sure that you are still breathing.\u201dHaving said that, Gu Shao took his suit off and handed it over to Wang Lu before he rolled his sleeves up.Seeing that, Zhang Qiang was fearful. He recoiled some more: Was this man going to hit him? This won\u2019t end well for him being beaten up by so many people!\u201cWhat? All of you want to beat up just one person?\u201d\u201cThat will be no need for that.\u201d Having said that, Gu Shao grabbed Zhang Qiang by his collar and tossed him to one side.Zhang Qiang hit the shelf behind him and that made a loud banging noise. The shell fell over and all the items fell down from it.Zhang Qiang saw darkness in front of his eyes and things turned in front of him. When he recollected himself, he was already laying on the ground and every part of his body was hurting from the impact.Zhang Qiang shouted at the outside, \u201cHelp! Someone is trying to kill me!\u201dSeeing that didn\u2019t work, he looked back at Gu Shao fearfully and shouted, \u201cI am going to call the cops! I am going to sue you! You evil forces are bulling me!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Gu Shao was very calm \u2013 even if he let Zhang Qiang to go call the cops, this was just a regular conflict between two citizens. The worst-case scenario was critical mediation. No harm no foul.\u201cWhat I am doing to you right now is only coming from a father whose child was harmed.\u201dHaving said that, Gu Shao stopped talking and picked Zhang Qiang up one more time.Zhang Qiang was strong but he was helpless in front of Gu Shao. As much as he had struggled, he wasn\u2019t able to avoid the blows from Gu Shao.Gu Shao did not go easy on him at all and it didn\u2019t take long for the angry words coming from Zhang Qiang to turn into tragic wailing.Looking at how pitiful Zhang Qiang looked, even Wang Lu and the few others shuddered. They had rarely seen their employer get violent and even less often to see him dealing such heavy blows.That being said, no methods could be more effective than this when one was dealing with a crook.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - \"You look so cool earlier, Dad!\" (3)On the other side, Lin Xi had been staying in the car.The possibility of Gu Shao going to look for Zhang Qiang make it difficult for Lin Xi to sit still. After hesitating for two seconds, she told Wang Wu that she was going to stretch her legs before she walked aimlessly, pretending that she was going for a walk, and \u201chappened\u201d to head toward the direction of Zhang Qiang\u2019s place.Having been there once, Lin Xi remembered the way to Zhang Qiang\u2019s place.When she arrived there and, before she could even walk inside the front yard, Lin Xi was startled by the screams coming from inside of Zhang Qiang\u2019s house and the voice belonged to none other than Zhang Qiang himself!Luckily, there weren\u2019t a lot of other houses around and, even if there were, they would be at a banquet somewhere. Otherwise, with the screams coming from Zhang Qiang, there would be a crowd gathering around outside his house by now.The bodyguard waiting outside of the door was taken aback a little when he saw Lin Xi. Then he saw Wang Wu, following behind her, looking helpless.Seeing that Lin Xi was heading toward the main house, the few bodyguards looked troubled.Luckily, Lin Xi stopped outside of the house.Going up to the front door that was left ajar, Lin Xi peeked inside of it.Just one quick look and her jaw dropped from what was going on inside of the house \u2013 it would not be an exaggeration to say that Zhang Qiang was beaten to a pulp.Lin Xi would never have guessed that Gu Shao would resort to such a simple and violent method to settle his scores with Zhang Qiang.Nor had she expected that Gu Shao was so skillful in fighting!She didn\u2019t know that martial art and physique were requirements to being a research professor in technology.***Inside the house, Gu Shao, noticing Lin Xi by the door, stopped what he was doing.He walked over and blocked Lin Xi from looking inside the house.\u201cYou didn\u2019t listen to what I\u2019ve said?\u201d said Gu Shao as he took the handkerchief from Wang Lu and wiped his hands on it.\u201cEmmm, that\u2019s not it.\u201d Standing properly in front of Gu Shao, Lin Xi had her head lowered and repented, \u201cI just, just worry that you\u2019d have gotten lost.\u201dWhat kind of a stupid reason was that?Even Lin Xi wished she could take that back.Gu Shao said not a word.Inside the house, Zhang Qiang, who had lucked out, laid on the floor and howled in pain.Noticing that Gu Shao was looking at him again, Zhang Qiang quickly dragged himself over and cowered in a corner. He looked like a mouse in front of a at.No, not a cat. This person was the devil himself!\u201cI, I was wrong. Please let me go, Boss.\u201d Zhang Qiang pleaded in pain.Then they heard a strange noise.Zhang Qiang was so frightened that he had wet himself.Upon seeing that, a look of disgust crossed Gu Shao\u2019s eyes.Lin Xi had no idea what had happened. She turned her heard curiously to find out but she saw nothing all of a sudden as Gu Shao had covered up her eyes with his hand.\u201cAre you trying to walk toward the dirt?\u201d said Gu Shao in a deep voice.\u201cNo\u2026 \u2026\u201d Lin Xi was carried out by Gu Shao before she could finish what she was saying.Wang Lu, Wang Wu, and the others followed behind them.\u201cTake care of this and have a report prepared,\u201d said Gu Shao to Wang Lu.\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d said Wang Lu. They would, indeed, need to have a report prepared \u2013 they would not want to have to explain why the head of the Gu family and renowned Professor Gu Shao beat up someone violently should words be leaked.\u201cIn addition, send him to jail,\u201d added Gu Shao.When Lin Xi said before to send Zhang Qiang to jail, she was mostly just bluffing. But Gu Shao wasn\u2019t kidding when he said to send Zhang Qiang to jail.Over ten years ago, Zhang Qiang and a few others were stealing cables around town. During one of their raids, they injured a maintenance worker and handicapped him.The controls were not as strong as they were nowadays and Zhang Qiang and his gang were able to hide out in a different village for a while and the incident went away.Bringing the incident up now would be sufficient to have Zhang Qiang put away for a few years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - And Gu Shao confiscated all of them. (1)\u201cAre you still trying to look?\u201d Gu Shao\u2019s face dropped when he noticed that Lin Xi was still trying to turn her head and take a look.\u201cMmm, no\u2026\u201d Lin Xi looked away and explained softly, \u201cI just want to see if he is still alive.\u201dIt\u2019d be quite troublesome if he had died.Lin Xi was a little worried.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Gu Shao. He found the nervousness on Lin Xi amusing.\u201cBack to the car,\u201d said Gu Shao with a long face.\u201cOh.\u201d***After they had gotten back into the car, the car drove away slowly from Zhang Qiang\u2019s place.Lin Xi looked away from it and look over at Gu Shao, who was sitting next to her with a solemn look. Recalling the scene that she had witnessed earlier, she still felt incredulous.\u201cDad, did you really beat up that Zhang Qiang before I got there?\u201d Lin Xi couldn't help but asked.Gu Shao did not deny it but said, \u201cViolence is not a solution to things so I do not advocate using violence as solutions.\u201dUpon hearing that, the corner of Lin Xi\u2019s lips twitched. She couldn't help but thought to herself: Is this what they called double standards?\u201cThen what you did earlier was not violence?\u201d Lin Xi grumbled softly.Gu Shao heard her but did not deny it. \u201cI did a wrongful demonstration.\u201dAfter a slight pause, Gu Shao went on to say, \u201cCombating violence with violence was not advocated because it wasn\u2019t worth it. When violence was being exercised, you will bring about even worse influence and consequences to yourself and end up with problems that was worse that what it was before.\u201dHe looked back over at Lin Xi and said seriously, \u201cAs such, no matter what you run into in the future, the first and foremost to keep in mind is to remain calm and make the best decision basing on the situation. If you run into problems that you can\u2019t solve, don\u2019t rush to handle it yourself. Come and tell me, I will take care of it for you as your parent.\u201dGu Shao was very solemn when he said that but Lin Xi could feel a hint of concern coming from him.\u201cDo you understand?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cYes!\u201d replied Lin Xi with a nod. Smiling at Gu Shao, she said, \u201cI will let Dad knows right away when I run into problems in the future.\u201dLooking at the silly smile on Lin Xi, Gu Shao raised his brows and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d Lin Xi shook her head but finally couldn't help but praised, \u201cYou looked so cool earlier when you beat up the guy, Dad!\u201dGu Shao was taken aback a little when he heard that. A flash of helplessness flashed past his eyes. His intention was to teach Lin Xi a lesson but isn\u2019t her takeaway a bit off?\u201d***The car arrived at the front of the village shortly, where they stopped earlier.Both Gu Shao and Lin Xi got out of the car and was about to get back inside the one that they came in.At this time, someone walking in their direction caught Lin Xi\u2019s attention.After getting a clearer look at the old man who was hunched over with a limp, Lin Xi was surprised. Isn\u2019t that Song Shishan?Song Shishan was Zhang Cui\u2019s ex-husband who was also Song Kexin\u2019s birth father.In the novel, Song Shishan was a gambling addict who was in a lot of debt. Even Song Kexin, in City B, was went after for his debts.Initially, Chen Kexin accepted Lin Yize\u2019s proposition as his replacement lover for the sake of repaying her father\u2019s debts.She had it figured out later on and stopped paying for his debts. Instead, she encouraged Zhang Cui to divorce him.After Song Kexin and Lin Yize had gotten married, she leveraged Lin Yize\u2019s power to force Song Shishan into divorcing Zhang Cui.Zhang Cui had stayed in City B since and Song Shishan continued to hide out in his hometown.***In the past, when Lin Xi was still staying at the Lin\u2019s, she had seen Song Shishan a few times when he went asking for money from Song Kexin. As such, she remembered what he looked like.Village Zhang was immediately next to Village Song along with a few other villages. It looked like Song Shishan was just returning from some banquet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - And Gu Shao confiscated all of them. (2)Song Shishan, too, noticed Lin Xi who was just getting out of the car and seemed to have recognized her.Song Shishan was a bit surprised. He walked over, looked at Lin Xi, and asked uncertainly, \u201cYou are Xiao Xi?\u201dLin Xi nodded.Song Shishan, too, nodded in a daze.The two of them were not familiar with each other. There were strangers to each other, in fact. All Song Shishan knew was that this was his granddaughter but he didn\u2019t know what to say to her. He even forgot to ask what she was doing there.\u201cHave some candies.\u201d Song Shishan pulled out a handful of candies from his pocket and gave them to Lin Xi. There was a smile in his eyes.He probably got them from the banquet that he had attended just now.The atmosphere was a little awkward.Song Shishan noticed Gu Shao, who was standing next to Lin Xi. He couldn't help but gave him another look: This wasn\u2019t his daughter\u2019s man. Who was this then?\u201cThis is my dad. My real dad,\u201d said Lin Xi. She then turned to Gu Shao and told him who Song Shishan was.Gu Shao gave Song Shishan a look then nodded to him as a sort of a greeting.Standing in front of the young man who was obviously no ordinary person, Song Shishan seemed nervous and helpless. He nodded dryly before he turned to leave, heading in the direction of Village Song.Over here, the father and daughter did not spend too much time looking at the man who was walking further and further away from them.After all, it was no big deal running into Zhang Cui\u2019s ex-husband here.***\u201cGet inside the car. Let\u2019s go,\u201d said Gu Shao.Lin Xi nodded when she heard him and got inside of the car.Gu Shao took a look at the time and said to her, \u201cIt\u2019ll be a while before we get home and we won\u2019t be making any stops on our way. Let me know if you get hungry.\u201dThey could then stop by a restaurant.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I am not hungry. No need to stop,\u201d said Lu Shao. Then, shaking the candies in her hand, she smiled and said, \u201cBesides, I have candies.\u201d\u201cI can just eat the candies if I am hungry.\u201dHaving said that, Lin Xi handed two pieces of candies to Gu Shao. \u201cHere\u2019s a couple for Dad.\u201dGu Shao looked down at the two strawberry-flavored Alps candies. Hesitated for a little, he unwrapped on and put it in his mouth.It was ridiculously sweet and the overpowering artificial flavoring spread through his entire mouth.As such, the piece of candy that Lin Xi had just unwrapped and was about to pop it into her mouth, along with the remaining ones in her hand, were all taken away by Gu Shao.***Lin Xi had no idea when she had fallen asleep in the car.When Gu Shao noticed that Lin Xi had been extraordinarily quiet with no movements and looked down, he noticed that Lin Xi was almost asleep. Her mouth parted slightly and her head lowering gradually.A few times Gu Shao worried whether the girl\u2019s neck would just snap or that she would smash into the seat in front of her.Finally, couldn\u2019t stand looking at it any more, Gu Shao reached up and held Lin Xi\u2019s head.\u201cDo we have a blanket in the car?\u201d Gu Shao asked the chauffeur in front.The chauffeur was taken aback a little, \u201cUh\u2026 No.\u201dThe car had always only been a means of transportation for Gu Shao. Even if the trip was longer than usual, he would usually be taking care of some work from the car.They have never had a blanket in the car as they would be no use of one.Gu Shao frowned a little and said, \u201cHave one in the car from now on.\u201d\u201cIn addition.\u201d Pausing, Gu Shao added, \u201cStock some convenient snacks.\u201d\u201cSomething healthy,\u201d added Gu Shao.\u201cOkay. I will have them ready,\u201d said the chauffeur from the front.In the back seat, Gu Shao glanced over at the girl next to him and put his jacket over her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - \"Gu\" as in Gu Shao and \"Xi\" as in Zhenxi (cherish). (1)Perhaps because she had already been at the Gu\u2019s house for a few days, Lin Xi was now more familiar with Gu Shao\u2019s scent.Quite the contrary, the scent of dad from Gu Shao\u2019s jacket made Lin Xi feel particularly secure.Lin Xi rubbed up against the jacket and, as though it wasn\u2019t comfortable enough, she leaned directly onto Gu Shao.Clinging onto Gu Shao\u2019s arm, Lin Xi, as though she had located a pillow and a posture in which she would not fall off said pillow, continue to sleep soundly, her breathing becoming more even.Gu Shao wasn\u2019t sure if Lin Xi was very hot after she had fallen asleep or that kids her age tend to run higher in temperature. It had only been a little while before he noticed that Lin Xi was beginning to sweat.Her slightly wet hair resting on Gu Shao\u2019s arm was not a pleasant feeling.It was a very big challenge especially for one who was a germophobe.Nevertheless, Gu Shao did not feel resentful or repulsive toward it. That surprised even Gu Shao himself.From the front row, Wang Wu took a sneaky peek at the father and daughter through the rearview mirror. A tender smile appeared even on the steel-like man \u2013 even though Mr. Gu and young miss were a bit distant from each other previously but things should get better and better in the days to come, right?After all, Mr. Gu had been slowly but surely becoming a better and better father, albeit the fact that he might not even have noticed that change himself.***The car took the two of them back to the Gu\u2019s house.Lin Xi slept all the way back.She was still groggy when Gu Shao had woken her up.\u201cWake up. We are home,\u201d said Gu Shao.\u201cHmm?\u201d Lin Xi looked around, apparently couldn\u2019t tell that she was inside their own garage. She asked quizzically, \u201cWhere are we?\u201dHer quizzical look was comedic.\u201cGet out of the car first. Go sleep at home.\u201dHome?Lin Xi was taken aback a little from the word before she recollected herself. That was right, she was living with Gu Shao now. As such, this was her home. She has a home now.\u201cMmm, okay.\u201d Lin Xi nodded and got out of the car with Gu Shao. Walking inside the house, she still felt like she was walking on clouds.***Inside the house, seeing how Lin Xi was half-sleep and groggy, Aunty Mei quickly walked up to hold Lin Xi\u2019s hand.She had decided against asking \u201chow did it go with the household register?\u201d\u201cLin Xi looks like she is still asleep. She must be tired after such a long day. Come, come, don\u2019t just stand here anymore. Grandma Mei will take you back to your room so you can go back to bed.\u201dSeemingly worried that Lin Xi would bump into things, Aunty Mei held her hand and took her back to her room.But she was stopped by Gu Shao.\u201cLet\u2019s have dinner first before she goes to bed.\u201d Gu Shao\u2019s voice was not mean but it was solemnly authoritative.Lin Xi woke up a little bit more from that.***Lin Xi returned to her room after dinner.Inside the [Battle at the Summit of Tianchuang] chatgroup, the chat owner posted more messages.[AAA]: @Lin, are you almost back?[AAA]: Let\u2019s meet up when you are back. I want to talk about the details of the competition.[AAA]: \u2026 \u2026There were twenty or so more messages under that.Lin Xi was a little tired so she did not pay them too much attention.She saw the one response from [Lin]: I\u2019m busy.The chat owner @ Lin Xi.[AAA]: @X, what about you, dear? Where are you?[AAA]: Let me tell you. Lin is a quiet one but he is also an elite. We will be invincible when we work together as a team after he is back.Lin Xi, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dHow did she get loop into this team again?Lin Xi was too tired to worry about this right now. She closed out of the chat without further ado.***The next morning.Lin Xi was the first to get up.By the time Gu Shao was up, Lin Xi was already sitting in the dining room looking at him with her sparkling and anticipation-filled eyes.It wasn\u2019t difficult for Gu Shao to figure out what was on her mind from that look on her.Wiping away the smile on himself, Gu Shao returned to his usual solemn look and said, \u201cLet\u2019s have breakfast first. I will take you to the police station afterward.\u201dGu Shao had made a special appointment ahead of time. As such, they would be okay to head over on the weekend as well.His words put a big smile on Lin Xi.She reflexively started eating faster.\u201cSlow down,\u201d reminded Gu Shao. \u201cEat in a civilized manner.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026 \u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - \"Gu\" as in Gu Shao and \"Xi\" as in Zhenxi (cherish). (2)After dinner, something suddenly occurred to Lin Xi. She looked over at Gu Shao \u201cDad, when we transfer the household register over, does that mean we can get my ID card at the same time?\u201dGu Shao nodded, \u201cYes.\u201dLin Xi\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201d\u201cThen give me a minute.\u201d If she was going to have picture taken for her ID card, she shouldn\u2019t be dressed so casually.Lin Xi went back into her room, tied her hair up, combed them out nicely, before she picked up the prettiest outfit that she had.It was a brown dress and would work for a casual or formal event. It was neither too casual nor was it too stuck up.This was also one of the few from the batch that Aunty Mei had brought back the other day that was not pink and somewhat different in styles than other others.Did the \u201cboss\u201d throw these few in out of \u201csympathy\u201d?Lin Xi had some crazy ideas in her head.***When Lin Xi was ready, the two of them were on their way.Lin Xi didn\u2019t say a word their entire trip there.Gu Shao thought perhaps Lin Xi had gotten up too early and was still sleepy.Truth was, Lin Xi was just nervous.For some odd reasons, their trip to transfer her household register was very important to Lin Xi \u2013 once they had her household register moved over, she would no longer be the Lin Xi of the Lin family and she would be completely detached from \u201cLin Xi\u201d from the original novel.This would, perhaps, become a very critical point in her life.After they had arrived at the place, Lin Xi first had her photos taken next door.After walking out of the photo studio and holding her photos in her hand, Lin Xi sighed and looked very solemn.\u2013The identity card was such an important thing and all she thought was that she didn\u2019t want to look too solemn. She even smiled a little and, somehow, she looked like a fool in the photo.Could she have it redone\u2026\u2026?Gu Shao couldn\u2019t figure out why the girl was shaking her head and sighing. He glanced over at the photos that the girl was holding in her hand: She was pretty in the photos.\u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dThe cop who was helping Lin Xi in transferring over her household register was a young lady.She took the photos from Lin Xi and the proof and household register from Gu Shao and started working on it expertly.\u201cAre we transferring her household register under you, Mr. Gu?\u201d asked the little cop sister.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d After a slight pause, she asked again, \u201cAnd how are you two related?\u201d\u201cFather and daughter,\u201d replied Gu Shao as he handed over the DNA test from before and a signed document along with it.Hearing Gu Shao\u2019s response and looking at the DNA test result in her hand, the little cop sister looked surprised.She thought they were relatives but they turned out to be father and daughter.Of course she knew of Gu Shao. The renowned Professor Gu in the technology field and the boss of NTN Technology Center.Gu Shao seemed to still be single and yet his child was so old already.The little cop sister immediately had a 1 million word-length Mary Sue novel The CEO Had Fallen in Love with Me, The Genius Mother Ran Off with The Bun, and I Have Seven Boss Fathers written in her head.That being said, she thought about it some more, there were certainly a lot of messy love affairs and children born out of wedlock when it came to rich people.As much as she wanted to gossip, she maintained her professionalism and filled in \u2018father and daughter\u2019 in the \u2018relationship\u2019 box.The little cop sister then entered in Lin Xi\u2019s personal information and finger print one by one. She took a look at the information on the screen then turned to look at Gu Shao and Lin Xi.\u201cHer old ID card was voided a couple of days ago and she will need to have a new one done.\u201d Pausing a little, the cop asked, \u201cAre we using the same name for her new household register and ID card? Will we be changing her surname? If so, put down here what you would like her new name to be.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - \"Gu\" as in Gu Shao and \"Xi\" as in Zhenxi (cherish). (3)After taking the form from the cop sister and looking at the field that said \u201cName\u201d, Lin Xi paused a little, bit her lower lip, said nothing but turned to look at Gu Shao. There were inquiry and a hint of anticipation in her eyes.Under Lin Xi\u2019s nervous and anticipating look, Gu Shao said, \u201cYes, we will change it.\u201d\u201cWe will be changing the surname to \u2018Gu\u2019,\u201d said Gu Shao.Lin Xi smiled when she heard that. She couldn\u2019t even hold back her happiness.\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d Having said that, Lin Xi picked up the pen on the table and quickly started to fill out the form. She scribbled very fast as though she worried that Gu Shao might regret at any given moment.She wrote down \u201cGu Xi\u201d in the name field and was particularly attentive with each and every stroke.\u201cI\u2019m done!\u201d Lin Xi handed the form over to the little cop sister.At that very moment, Gu Shao took the form from her, picked up the pen, and added the heart character (\u5fc4) next to \u201cXi\u201d.Gu Xi. (T/N: Pronunciation of the two characters were identical.)\u201cGu\u201d as in \u201cGu Shao\u201d.But \u201cXi\u201d was no longer \u201cXi as in milkshake\u201d but \u201cXi as in cherish.\u201dLin Xi\u2019s eyes widened and she looked over at Gu Shao in disbelief. She saw that Gu Shao had already turned the form over to the cop who was responsible for the registration.Over on the other side, the cop, seemingly infected by the pleasantly surprised look from Lin Xi, smiled and said \u201cAlright, so \u2018Gu Xi\u2019 then?\u201d\u201cMmm mmm,\u201d said Lin Xi, er, Gu Xi, with a nod.\u201cOkay, please confirm this for me.\u201d The little cop sister printed out a receipt for Gu Shao and Gu Xi.On it was all of Lin Xi\u2019s personal information from the past.It included all the names that she had used before. There were two names in that field.One was \u201cLin Xi\u201d, and the other one was \u201cZhang Laidi\u201d. That must have been the name that Zhang Youfu had picked for her when they transferred her household register over. (T/N: Laidi = \u201cCome, little brother\u201d.)One could tell just from the name alone how desperately the family wanted to have another son.Gu Xi frowned.Reflexively, she tried to scratch at it with her fingernail. Pouting, she turned to look at Gu Shao.\u201cI don\u2019t want this one\u2026\u2026\u201dNot only did the name had a bad connotation, it was represented a bad memory of hers.The thought that this \u201cpast used name\u201d would follow her for the rest of her life: When she applied to college, \u201cpast used name: Zhang Laidi\u201d would be listed; when she underwent qualification review, \u201cpast used name: Zhang Laidi\u201d; when she went to get her passport, \u201cpast name used: Zhang Laidi\u201d would be under her personal information \u2013 that upset Gu Xi a lot.This was the very first time that Gu Xi had definitively expressed \u201cI don\u2019t like it\u201d in front of Gu Shao. Capturing Gu Xi\u2019s pleading look, Gu Shao, too, looked over at the name \u201cZhang Laidi\u201d and frowned.He turned to the household register cop and said, \u201cHer household register had been transferred over to a family in the village without the knowledge of neither one of us. This was the name that was added at the time. I had included this situation in the information that I had provided.\u201cAfter listening to Gu Shao\u2019s explanation, the household register cop looked upset and frowned as well. Transferring out someone\u2019s household register without their knowledge could also be classified as kidnapping in some respect!She couldn\u2019t believe something like this was still happening from time to time in this day and age!\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, this does not make sense and it should not be listed as a \u2018past used name\u2019. I will remove it right away,\u201d said the household register cop and immediately deleted the name.Seeing the name \u201cZhang Laide\u201d disappearing completely from her personal record, Gu Xi let out a sigh of relief.What she didn\u2019t know what that Gu Shao had, later on, pulled some other strings and had \u201cLin Xi\u201d removed from her record completely as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - \"You tell him. If he doesn't come back then, he never needs to come back again.\" (1)It will take a few days before the ID card arrived but Gu Xi\u2019s information had already been added to Gu Shao\u2019s household register.Seeing how Gu Xi kept on glancing over at the household register in his hand like a child looking at toys, Gu Shao found that amusing and handed it over to Gu Xi.Gu Xi smiled to herself when she received the household register.First, she flipped to the newest page \u2013 the page about her \u2013 and looked at it over and over again. Then, when Gu Shao wasn\u2019t paying attention, she flipped to the page with his information.\u201cMarch 17?\u201d Gu Xi quietly committed the date to her memory.Then, to her surprised, Gu Xi noticed that Gu Shao had been in the military in the past.Here she thought that he had always been in the academic research field.Gu Xi grumbled to herself.***Aunty Mei was already waiting by the door when they arrived home.\u201cAh, you two are back. Did everything go smoothly?\u201d\u201cMmhmm, went very well,\u201d said Gu Nian as she nodded.Seeing the smile on Gu Xi, Aunty Mei smiled as well. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear. Go change quickly, Xiao Xi. Get some rest, dinner will be ready soon.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cOh yeah, Grandma Mei, don\u2019t call me \u2018Xiao Xi\u2019 anymore from now on. I am \u2018Xiao Xi\u2019 now,\u201d said Gu Xi with a bright smile.Aunty Mei was baffled by what Gu Xi had said: What was the difference between \u201cXiao Xi\u201d and \u201cXiao Xi\u201d?\u201cWe changed her name to \u2018Xi\u2019. \u2018Xi\u2019 as in cherish,\u201d explained Gu Shao for Gu Xi.Over on the other side, Gu Xi had already bounced back into her own room, still holding onto Gu Shao\u2019s household register that she had forgotten to return to him.Looking at Gu Xi\u2019s back, even Gu Shao\u2019s look had mellowed out.***Inside the bedroom, Gu Xi looked at her own name on the household register and felt another pang of foolish joy.Then, she clicked open her social software and bragged with her very first post: [Hi everyone. I am Gu Xi.]She had 0 friends right now and nobody would see that anyway.Well, that wasn\u2019t entirely true. She had added the [Battle at the Summit of Tianchuang] chat group and the group owner had added her as a friend.Regardless, it was just a stranger anyway. No biggie.***While Gu Xi was rejoicing inside her own room, Gu Shao, outside, received a call from Old Mr. Gu.Over the phone, Old Mr. Gu started lecture Gu Shao right away, \u201cXixi is our Gu family\u2019s precious granddaughter and her household register should fall under the old Gu family! I don\u2019t care that you wanted to split from the family, but what is the meaning of placing Xixi\u2019s household register under you instead of our family? Are you trying to drive me insane??\u201dBy now, Old Mr. Gu had already learned about Gu Xi\u2019s new name from Aunty Mei.Originally, know that Gu Shao was about to transfer Gu Xi\u2019s household register over, Old Mr. Gu was somewhat excited. He already had the old Gu family\u2019s household register, genealogy ready along with possible new names for Gu Xi. He was just waiting for Gu Shao to bring his nice granddaughter over and asked for the household register.Old Mr. Gu even had the kitchen prepared more sweet and sour dishes.In the end, after all the waiting, what Old Mr. Gu found out was that the jerk Gu Shao had already transferred Gu Xi\u2019s household register under himself.He was so mad!Old Mr. Gu sneered into the phone. \u201cI don\u2019t care about you but you must transfer Xiao Xi\u2019s household register over under the old Gu family.\u201d\u2013 So you finally going to stop pretending that you knew nothing about this?Gu Shao snickered.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong having Xiao Xi\u2019s household register under me,\u201d said Gu Shao.\u201cBesides.\u201d Pausing a little, Gu Shao\u2019s eyes darkened a little. \u201cIt\u2019s better her household register not go under the Gu family than running into other random issues later on.\u201dGu Shao\u2019s words made Old Mr. Gu\u2019s look froze. Everything that had happened in the past rushed into his mind.Old Mr. Gu sighed. \u201cWhat happened back then, and those about your big brother were truly\u2026\u2026\u201dHalf way through, Old Mr. Gu stopped and sighed.After the phone call, Old Mr. Gu sat on the chair, looking unhappy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - \"You tell him. If he doesn't come back then, he never needs to come back again.\" (2)When Uncle Zhou, the butler, saw that, he quickly came to comfort Old Mr. Gu. \u201cSir, that happened a long time ago and you shouldn\u2019t let it bother you anymore. What had happened back then, was nobody\u2019s fault.\u201d Besides, he had a feeling that Gu Shao had already found out about the truth and possibly knew of more details than even Old Mr. Gu.He had a feeling that Gu Shao didn\u2019t truly blame Old Mr. Gu for that.Perhaps\u2026 perhaps Gu Shao had other reasons\u2026\u201cYeah, what\u2019s in the past is in the past,\u201d said Old Mr. Gu before he let out a deep, long sigh. \u201cIt was just that our little princess ended it on someone else\u2019s household register.\u201dButler Zhou wanted to chuckle when he heard that: Her household register was transferred under Second Young Sir\u2019s. How was that \u201csomeone else\u201d?\u201cI am sure that Second Young Sir only wanted to protect the young miss.\u201d Butler Zhou carried on to say: After all, the Gu family was too big and attracted too much attention.Old Mr. Gu wasn\u2019t too happy upon hearing that. \u201cProtect? Are you saying that we can\u2019t protect her then? The Gu family didn\u2019t that all those craziness like we did before now.\u201dOld Mr. Gu got upset all over again. Nevertheless, it didn\u2019t take him long to \u201ccure\u201d himself.\u201cGu Xi. Cherish the time when one is young. Mmm. Good. That\u2019s a good name. Haha.\u201d Old Mr. Gu cheered up again while thinking about Gu Xi\u2019s new name.Butler Zhou, to one side, grumbled to himself: It wasn\u2019t that the name was great. As long as it was his granddaughter\u2019s name, any name would be a great name.The other friends of Old Mr. Gu in his friend's circle had no idea what had gotten into Gu Qinghua \u2013 he had been practicing his calligraphy all of a sudden and even taken pictures of his work and posted them into his friend's circle.Old Mr. Chen, from the other end, saw Old Mr. Gu\u2019s post and grumbled, \u201cHrm. Why was that Gu Qinghua showing off his awful calligraphy? And the only character he kept writing over and over again was \u2018Xi\u2019.\u201d***Before Old Mr. Gu had even finished showing off, Gu Yanlin had returned with suitcase upon suitcase of stuff.Looking at the \u201ccold and empty\u201d house, Gu Yanlin was surprised: That wasn\u2019t exactly the picture that he had envisioned.\u201cSecond Uncle and Xixi hadn\u2019t been back yet?\u201d Gu Yanlin asked Aunty Wang next to him.\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d said Aunty Wang.Gu Yanlin was disappointed. The were limited flights between the two countries and tickets were difficult to come by. He had to pay a large amount for someone to cancel their ticket so he was able to fly back. Lo and behold, there was no soft and cute little sister at home!\u201cDid they say when they are coming back?\u201dAunty Wang, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d She had no idea. Not even the old sir knew when second young sir would be coming.This was the very first time she saw Young Sir Lin caring so much about something.Aunty Wang wiped away her non-existing sweat, thought about it some, and changed the subject. \u201cYou just got off the plane, right, Young Sir Lin. Let me have someone else you bring your luggage up.\u201d\u2013 That was odd. Young Sir Lin only had one suitcase with him when he left the country but he returned with six?\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d Gu Yanlin declined her offer. \u201cI will bring them upstairs myself in a little while.\u201dHaving said that, he pointed at the other six suitcases and said, \u201cThere is no need to bring these upstairs. Just leave them in the storage for now.\u201dThese were the gifts that he had brought back for his little sister from Country E.\u201cOh, never mind. I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dAs though worry that someone else would damage them, Gu Yanlin finally placed all of the gifts into the storage personally.Then he headed over to Old Mr. Gu\u2019s study.When he saw Old Mr. Gu, the first thing he said wasn\u2019t how Old Mr. Gu had been but, \u201cSecond Uncle hasn\u2019t come to pick up the household register yet?\u201dOld Mr. Gu had said in one of the chatgroup that Gu Shao wasn\u2019t in that Gu Shao would be coming to add Gu Xi to their household register.\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d Old Mr. Gu, who had just got over his anger, refused to bring up this sad, sad matter.Gu Yanlin had it figured out now. He cleared his throat and said, \u201cIt\u2019s great that Second Uncle had found little sister. Why don\u2019t we have him over for dinner?\u201dOld Mr. Gu gave Gu Yanlin a stare and said, \u201cHrm. If you can make him do it, go right ahead.\u201dHaving said that, Old Mr. Gu still summoned Butler Zhou after Gu Yanlin had excused hiself, \u201cGo give that jerk a call and told him that Mid-autumn festival is in two weeks and have him come for dinner. And, tell him that if he doesn\u2019t come then, to never come again.\u201cHRM!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - \"It looks like Lin Xi's parent is really some big shot.\" (2)Over on this side, after getting off the call with Butler Zhou, Gu Shao replied him with a \u201cAlright.\u201dHe took a look at the time, then over at Gu Xi who had been dragging her feet staying in the living room refusing to go to bed. Gu Shao frowned and put on a solemn face. \u201cIt\u2019s 11 o\u2019clock already. Go to bed.\u201dHe then added after a slight pause. \u201cI will bring you to Liming High School tomorrow.\u201dLiming High School was Gu Nian\u2019s former high school.There would only be one reason for them to head over there.\u201cAre we there for my transfer?\u201d asked Gu Xi, feeling a little excited.\u201cMmm,\u201d acknowledged Gu Shao. He then added, \u201cSo go to bed now.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Knowing that they would be transferring her tomorrow, Gu Xi stopped dilly-dallying around the living room and returned to her own bedroom to go to bed.***The next day, Gu Shao brought Gu Xi with him to Liming High School.Looking at the familiar campus, Gu Xi felt that it had been ages since she had been here.It was during class time so the campus was very quiet.A teacher came up to them specifically and brought them to the principal\u2019s office.Inside the office, the principal looked at the father and daughter duo in front of him with the transfer request in his hand and many thoughts were rushing through his head \u2013 this \u201cLin Xi\u201d in front of him was the child of the Lin family not too long ago. How did she all of a sudden become Gu Shao\u2019s child in just a few days?As shocked as he was, he knew that that wasn\u2019t a subject that he could broach. As such, he looked normally at Gu Shao and Lin Xi.\u201cSo, Mr. Gu, you are here for Lin, er, Gu Xi\u2019s transfer, right?\u201d asked the principal.\u201cYes.\u201dThe principal nodded with Gu Shao\u2019s definitely answer. \u201cOkay, I see.\u201dWith all the formed filled out, the process to transfer out a student was not complicated.That being said, the principal was still sad to see a top student such as Gu Xi transferring to another school \u2013 even though they were a private school, their metrics still mattered.A top student could bring a lot of pride and benefits for a school.All the awards that Gu Xi had won for their school in competitions representing their school notwithstanding, her grades at every city-wide uniform examination were up there when comparing with students from other school.\u201cIf she was only switching to a different guardian\u2026 ahem, I mean to a new environment, she doesn\u2019t necessarily need to transfer to a different school. After all, she had already been with us for over a year and had adapted well to our school. Her performance is steady. She might not adapt well at her new school.\u201dPausing a little, the principal carried on, \u201cIf it was just a name change, that\u2019s fine as well. We can update her names in her student file, her past grades and awards.\u201dThe principal tried to keep Gu Xi at their school.Gu Shao\u2019s look deepened.He asked Gu Xi to wait outside when he looked at the principal coldly.\u201cWe are not trying to transfer her simply because she has a new guardian.\u201dLooking at the principal coldly, Gu Shao said in a deep voice, \u201cDuring my daughter\u2019s stay at your school, she had been slandered by rumors and that had severely impacted her social life at school as well as her personal reputation.\u201cYour school had failed to handle this incident properly which made her situation at school even more difficult. She was constantly under attack at school and under public opinions.\u201cAs such, I do not see the need for my daughter to remain at your school.\u201d Gu Shao\u2019s voice was not raised but each of his words were cold and fiercely irrefutable.Gu Shao\u2019s words made the principal\u2019s look froze on her face. He understood where Gu Shao was coming from now and, all of a sudden, looking even more unhappy.\u2013 He would admit that the school did not do as much as they should on that one incident involving Gu Xi.But they had their reasons.When they found out that Lin Anxin was the culprit behind the rumors, they were going to deal with the incident severely.Nevertheless, the Lin family came to the school before they were able to announce their findings: They were not there to fight for \u201cLin Xi\u201d, they were there for Lin Anxin. The Lin family wished for the school to drop the incident and never mention it again.Both \u201cLin Xi\u201d and Lin Anxin were the children of the Lin family. As such, what more could the school do when their parents came to the school and asked for the incident to be dropped?Who would have thought that Gu Xi was not the child of the Lin family after all?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - \"It looks like Lin Xi's parent is really some big shot.\" (2)The principal looked awkwardly at Gu Shao. Finally, he stood up, bowed at Gu Shao, and said, \u201cYou are right, Mr. Gu. We should have handled the matter better. I apologize. If Gu Xi wants to transfer out, we will work with you to make that happen.\u201dGu Shao still looked cold and hard, \u201cI thank you in advance then.\u201d\u201cIn addition, I would like to see the untruthful words that attacked my daughter on the forum during her stay at your school removed completely,\u201d added Gu Shao. \u201cIf you are not able to do that, I will be happy to help.\u201dThe first half of his words was a request and the second half were blatant threat.The principal\u2019s face changed color when he heard Gu Shao\u2019s words. He replied nervously, \u201cNo, that will not be necessary. We shall take care of that from our end.\u201dThings would probably be blown out of proportion if they had Gu Shao take care of this. And the school might get into other kinds of troubles.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Gu. I promise that we will get rid of them all and it would not affect Gu Xi in any way in the future.\u201dThe school had addressed the issue of the scandals in the past and had made public announcements as well. This time, however, they might have to shut down the forum for quite a bit of time to have the matter completely taken care of.When push came to shove, they might even have to announce who the culprit was.But it was like he had a lot of options now.The Lin family was powerful and has clout but, in comparison, Gu Shao, as the professor of A University and the CEO of NTN Technology Center, was much more influential to the school.If he must choose between the two, it would doubtless be the latter.***Outside of the office.Gu Xi, leaning up against the wall, had no idea what Gu Shao and the principal was talking about inside of the office. She was a little bored.Right then, the classes were let out and two students who were bringing things to the teachers were coming toward the offices.When Gu Xi had noticed them, they had spotted Gu Xi as well. They looked surprised when they recognized her.Gu Xi\u2019s heart sank a little and she reflexively wanted to hide.But she stopped herself the very next second: Wait, why did she need to hide? She didn\u2019t do anything wrong and she was not ashamed of herself. What reasons did she have to hide from others?Having thought of that, she stood up properly outside of the principal\u2019s office, her back straight and she looked calm. She did not dodge when she saw the other two looking her up and down curiously.***The two students walked in front of Gu Xi and toward the office of their class teacher.Only after they were a distance from Gu Xi before the two exchanged a look, picked up their paces, and only started discussing about Gu Xi when they were even further away from her.\u201cDid I see it right? That was Lin Xi from 2A, right?\u201dThe top student of her entire rank who was later on ostracized and avoided by others. She was surely a memorable existence.\u201cI think so.\u201d\u201cStrange. We haven\u2019t seen her in a while, right?\u201d\u201cIt was said that she was getting ready to study overseas.\u201d Then the person shook his head as he was talking. \u201cNo, wait. Some said she was recovering from some illness as well.\u201d\u201cSo was she here at the principal office to complete her paperwork to study aboard or to return to school now that she had recovered from her illness?\u201d\u201cI have no idea.\u201d***When the two were gone, Gu Xi turned her attention back and continued to stare at the tip of her feet while she waited for Gu Shao.She seemed a bit lonesome being all by herself in the hallway.Finally, Gu Shao walked out from the principal\u2019s office.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Gu Xi recollected herself. \u201cWe are done?\u201d\u201cMmhmm.\u201d Gu Shao nodded.Gu Xi noticed that he had with him a file folder with him with stuff inside of it.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d She asked curiously.\u201cSome stuff of yours that were not entered into your school record,\u201d said Gu Shao. The principal had a teacher went and retrieved some duplicates of awards that Gu Xi had earned in the past and also some outstanding work and essays that the school had exhibited.Gu Shao has yet to have a chance to look through them.Gu Xi couldn\u2019t think of anything right off the bat that was not yet in her student file. She nodded, somewhat perplexed, and followed behind Gu Shao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - \"It looks like Lin Xi's parent is really some big shot.\" (3)What Lin Xi didn\u2019t know was that as soon as the two students who had walked passed her returned to the classroom, they immediately shared with the others that they had seen her in the hallway.It wasn\u2019t a big deal in and of itself but with Lin Xi\u2019s \u201ccelebrity\u201d effect, that had stirred up quite a bit of discussions among the students.The classes had just finished and, seeing that Gu Shao and Gu Xi were leaving, many poked their heads out from the classrooms and ogled.\u201cEh, that really is Lin Xi.\u201d\u201cIs she leaving already?\u201d\u201cIs she transferring?\u201dAll sorts of voices could be heard.Quickly, these individuals\u2019 attention went from Gu Xi to Gu Shao.\u201cIs that her parent next to her?\u201d Said someone in surprised while pointing at Gu Shao.Ever since the beginning of school, nobody had never seen Lin Xi\u2019s parents before. They had never even seen anyone coming for her parent-teacher conference.As such, the parents of the number one in her grade had become a legend.And now, seeing that there\u2019s an adult next to Lin Xi, everybody couldn't help but be curious.\u201cLooks like it,\u201d grumbled someone softly.\u201cWow, amazing\u2026 For a while there I thought she has no parents.\u201d\u201cHow does that make sense. Perhaps they live overseas. That being said, I felt that her parent is really somebody.\u201dGu Shao did not look like just any ordinary person when it came to his aura or temperament.\u201cThat is a custom car, right? It\u2019s not a ready-made one. And, look at that license plate. Not every one can get one of those.\u201dThe few who were gossiping exchanged a look.\u201cOld Mr. Gu. Is Lin Xi\u2019s parent some sort of a big shot?\u201d\u201cNow that you have mentioned it. I can\u2019t see him clearly from this distance but he does look somewhat familiar. I think I have seen him in some publications before.\u201dThe person next to them nodded. \u201cI think so too. Look, why else would the principal walk them out in person?\u201d***The discussion quieted down.All of them recalled something at the same time: The rumor from the forum.It said that Lin Xi came from a lowly background. Giving what they were looking at right now, that sounded like a blatant rumor!And the saying that Lin Xi was only able to do so well on her examinations because she had a \u201cthing\u201d with the boss of the print shop and was able to get the test papers ahead of them was even more ridiculous.Judging from the respectful look on the principal and how he was nodding and bowing, had Lin Xi wanted the test papers ahead of time, she might as well get them directly from the principal. Why would she need to use such a stupid and convoluted method?Not to mention that in many of examinations, quizzes, and competitions that followed, Lin Xi had more than proven that she was a valedictorian. She did not need to cheat.\u201cAye, it was all that rumor\u2019s fault.\u201d Someone lamented.\u201cExactly. What was that all about? The school never did announce who it was behind that. I thought those were all true.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d They resumed their gossiping.The truth had been there all along. The only difference was what the others choose to believe in at different time from different perspective.***Lin Anxin was one among the crowd.She had been talking about Lin Xi with the others as well, except that the topic had already switched course.\u201cThat\u2019s Lin Xi\u2019s parent, right? Do you know him, Anxin?\u201d Someone turned and asked Lin Anxin.Lin Anxin shook her head.She had, in fact, saw that man before. At their house, just the other day. But she didn\u2019t want to share that.Seeing that, the person next to her nodded. Then, something else occurred to them and they smiled, \u201cI knew it. Someone said you and Lin Xi were related before. That was hilarious.\u201dAnother one of them chimed in as well, \u201cThat was right. I was quite surprised too.\u201dLin Anxin remained silent with a long face.\u2013\u2013 Even though Lin Xi left with her and arrived at school together every day, Lin Anxin did not want others to know that she was her sister.As such, she would ask the chauffeur to pull over when they were still a little distance from the school and had Lin Xi get out first before dropping her off at the front of the school.Their family did not object to that.Later on, when the rumors had started and Lin Xi earned a bad reputation, Xu Jiaofeng and the others agreed with Lin Anxin\u2019s behavior.They even had the two of them go to school separately afterward.They didn\u2019t want Lin Anxin affected by Lin Xi\u2019s poor reputation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - \"It looks like Lin Xi's parent is really some big shot.\" (4)The reason they were rumored to be related was because Lin Anxin had turned in one of Lin Xi\u2019s work for a major homework assignment in her freshman year. She had, however, forgot to change the name on one spot.The two of them were also spotted coming from the same direction after that.As such, the speculation was born.That also happened during the period of time when rumor on Lin Xi was at its worst and Lin Xi was being ostracized by everyone at school.As such, Lin Anxin didn\u2019t even think about it when she denied it.As nobody had any concrete proof so the rumor went away when Lin Anxin denied it.\u201cBut I feel that you really can\u2019t just believe in everything from rumors. It looks like Lin Xi is from a pretty decent family.\u201d\u201cExactly, her parent looks to be some kind of a big shot.\u201dWhen the two chitchatted, they were not aware that Lin Anxin\u2019s face was getting longer and longer.Looking in the direction where the car had left in, Lin Anxin did not say a word. Her hand, however, gripped tightly around the edge of her uniform and there was hatred in her eyes.\u2013 She had hated Lin Xi since they were both children. Everything that she had at home was better than Lin Xi\u2019s. As such, she could not stand Lin Xi having anything that was better than hers.Lo and behold, Lin Xi\u2019s grades were always higher than hers. Even though they were not in the same grade, Lin Xi was always top of her grade. And Lin Anxin, no matter how hard she tried and how many tutors she had, could at most score above average.That made Lin Anxin hated Lin Xi even more.She was happy for a short while after she had learned that Lin Anxin was not a child of the Lin family but that was short-lived \u2013 that man who claimed to be Lin Xi\u2019s birth father looked nice. Even Lin Anxin\u2019s own father seemed to be intimidated by him.How could that happen? Lin Xi existed only for her to look good and should be stepped on by her. She would not allow Lin Xi to possess anything better than hers, not even her birth!Lin Anxin\u2019s face became more twisted as she thought about this.***Over on this end, Gu Xi had no idea the kind of effects she had on others.In the end of the day, nothing about this school had anything to do with her anymore.Sitting inside the car and watched as the school became further and further away, Gu Xi let out a long sigh of relief and her lips curved upward again.Even the air seemed fresher since they had walked out of the school.Next to her, seeing the look on Gu Xi as though she had been freed from a trap and a heavy weight had been lifted, Gu Shao thought to himself, \u201clittle coward\u201d. That being said, his look had mellowed out without him noticing.***After they had gotten home.That night, lying in bed, Gu Xi was unable to fall asleep.After staring at the ceiling for a little while, Gu Xi finally jumped out of bed, walked outside of her room, and just wandered aimlessly in the living room.Gu Shao, at this moment, was taking care of some research proposals that had been escalated up to him.He had been visiting the Zhang Village, transferring Gu Xi\u2019s household register, transferring her school, etc. in the last few days and had not been to the NTN Technology Center. As such, he had some work to catch up on.Hearing noises from the outside, Gu Shao put down his pen and looked up.That was when he saw Gu Xi wandered past the front of the study in her pajama like a ghost.Gu Shao frowned and stopped her.Gu Xi, who had been stopped, was startled. She called him softly, \u201cDad.\u201d\u201cWhy are you still up?\u201d asked Gu Shao in a deep voice.\u201cUh, I am thirsty so I come out to get some water,\u201d explained Gu Xi as she pointed in the direction of the kitchen.She couldn\u2019t possibly tell Gu Shao that the idea of starting the new school was keeping her up at night, could she?Looking at Gu Shao\u2019s stern face, Gu Xi felt a guilty conscience and added softly, \u201cWould you like some water too, Dad?\u201dBefore Gu Shao could answer her, Gu Xi had already shuffled into the kitchen and poured herself a glass of water. She poured a glass for Gu Shao as well.Gu Xi carefully walked back into the study with the water.Watching how she carefully she was walking, Gu Shao\u2019s temples throbbed: were there landmines on the floor?Gu Xi put down the glass of water carefully and was about to slip away after a \u201cGoodnight, Dad\u201d when she was stopped by Gu Shao.\u201cSit there,\u201d said Gu Shao as he pointed at a chair inside his study.\u201cOh,\u201d said Gu Xi as she docilely shuffled over there.\u201cWhy are you still up at this hour?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cBecause\u2026\u2026\u201d she wanted to get some water.Before Gu Xi was able to say that out loud, Gu Shao asked again, \u201cBecause you are anxious about starting the new school tomorrow?\u201dGu Xi was taken aback some, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dOh shoot. He nailed it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Is \u201cGod Xiu\u201d referring to a student in this class?\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Gu Nian denied it reflexively.Meeting the look coming from Gu Shao, Gu Xi bit her lip, struggled a little and finally said in a soft voice, \u201cMaybe just a little.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not anxious, just\u2026 \u2026\u201d Gu Xi thought about it some and said, \u201cNervous?\u201dThe look in Gu Shao relaxed a little. He said to her, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be nervous, or anxious.\u201cWhen you start your new school, you can do what you want to do and what you think you should do. Get along well with your classmates but there is also no need to be too conscious of what others think of you. Do you understand?\u201dWas Gu Shao telling her how to adjust to her new environment?Gu Shao was a little surprised. Then she heard Gu Shao carried on to say, \u201cIf you run into situations similar to what happened in your previous school and that you are not able to handle it yourself, you can always come and tell me. I will take care of it for you.\u201dGu Shao\u2019s voice was calm but, somehow, Gu Xi felt a warm feeling in her heart and her eyes sore as though there were something there.Looking at the incredulous look on Gu Xi, Gu Shao\u2019s heart sank a little: As much as Gu Xi had acted normally the entire time, it was obvious that her experiences at the Lin family had scarred her a lot over time. As such, she had very strong guard toward the outside world.All she could ever think of when something arose was what she could do within her power to resolve the situation. And when it was a situation that she was unable to handle, she had learned to put up with it.That should not be the case of a 14-year-old.Gu Shao put down the document in his hand and walked over to Gu Xi. Stroking her over her head, he said to her, \u201cI am your parent. It is my duty to do so.\u201dGu Xi\u2019s lips parted but she didn\u2019t know what to say. She only looked at Gu Shao, dazed.\u201cNow go to bed.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Gu Xi smiled at Gu Shao.\u201cHehe.\u201d This time she was smiling to cover up the redness around her eyes.Gu Xi ran back into her room and buried herself under her blanket. She buried her face in the soft and slightly scented pillow. She rubbed her face against the pillow and also got rid of the droplets in her eyes.***The next day, Gu Shao declined a lecture at A University and driven Gu Xi to school in person. He brought her all the way to her new class teacher.Gu Xi learned that her class teacher was Teacher Chen, the one who proctored her examinations the other day. She greeted her.Gu Shao nodded at Teacher Chen with a \u201cThank you in advance\u201d before he handed Gu Xi over to her.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Professor Gu. Gu Xi will be fine over here. We will notify you immediately should any issue arise,\u201d said Teacher Chen.After seeing Gu Shao off, Teacher Chen was very emotional when she looked over at Gu Xi.\u2013 \u2013 She had fought hard to have Gu Xi assigned to her class.Teacher Chen was very surprised by Gu Xi\u2019s scores after the examinations the other day. As such, she approached the director of their grade to pro-actively ask to have Gu Xi assigned to her #7 class.She had only thought of Gu Xi as a good student previously until she saw Gu Xi documents that had been transferred over the day before. She finally recalled who Gu Xi was when she saw Gu Xi\u2019s records.No wonder she thought \u201cLin Xi\u201d sounded familiar. She was the #1 in the school across the street!There had always been open and covert competitions between the top schools in City B. As such, the teachers over at this school was well aware of Liming High School\u2019s competition results, scorings on standardized examinations, as well as their few top students.It had been a tradition over the years that the few comparable schools in City B would hold a Comprehensive Fall Standardized Examinations together every year. And HSAU had more or less taken the first spot in the past ten years. They had been the reigning champion for 9 years in a row, until last year.And the one who ended their trend was a top student by the name of \u201cLin Xi\u201d at Liming International High School.*Teacher Chen never expected that the valedictorian from their biggest competitor would turn into a student in her class.They already had a valedictorian in her #7 class. With the addition of Gu Xi now, it was like a miracle coming true.Teacher Chen could already see all sorts of awards and interviews coming her way.Looking at Gu Xi, Teacher Chen gave her a \u201ckind\u201d smile.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Gu Xi. Let me show you to the classroom.\u201d___Translator\u2019s rambling:Okay, this is silly but so cool at the same time. =DPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - Is \u201cGod Xiu\u201d referring to a student in this class? (2)Teacher Chen and Gu Xi walked into the classroom right when the morning homeroom was over.The classroom was very lively until the minute their class teacher walked in. They quieted down immediately.Nevertheless, when they saw Gu Xi following behind her, the classroom became lively all over again.\u201cLook, look. Is that our new classmate?\u201d said someone loudly.Everybody looked over at Gu Xi when that person was done\u201cThis new classmate of ours is quite pretty!\u201d\u201cYou sure this was the valedictorian that Teacher Chen mentioned yesterday?\u201d They just could not associate this new classmate of theirs with the word \u201cvaledictorian\u201d.\u201cTeacher Chen did not mention that we will be getting a school flower yesterday.\u201d Someone retorted.As everybody talked at the same time, Teacher Chen cleared her throat and said, \u201cQuiet down. You guys are distracting those in the classrooms next to us!\u201dThe classroom began quieting down after she had said that.As such, Teacher Chen brought Gu Xi to the front of the podium and introduced her to the others, \u201cThis is Gu Xi. As I have mentioned, she will be transferring into our class\u2026 \u2026\u201dBefore Teacher Chen was even done talking, someone else shouted out again, \u201cOh my gosh. It IS her!\u201dTeacher Chen glared at the person who said that.The person shrank their neck some and kept their mouth shut. Teacher Chen carried on, \u201cShe is new to our school and is not familiar with the environment. Do spend some time in helping her out, okay?\u201dWhat really was going through Teacher Chen\u2019s mind right now was for her students that always had her worried sick to mingle with the valedictorian so they could bring up their scores somehow.Having said that, Teacher Chen looked over at Gu Xi, pointed at a spot and said to her, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit over there, Gu Xi?\u201dGu Xi looked over in the direction that Teacher Chen had pointed at. There was an empty seat in the third row.It looked to have been emptied out ahead of time.Gu Xi nodded and walked over there under everyone\u2019s watchful eyes.On the podium, Teacher Chen mentioned a few more items before she turned and left, leaving the classroom to the teacher of the follow class.***Gu Xi, by now, had already sat down at her seat. Before she could even put her stuff down, her deskmate had already stuck her head over affectionately.\u201cSo your name is Gu Xi? Which \u2018Xi\u201d is it? Is it \u2018Xi\u2019 as in the morning sun?\u201d asked the girl.\u201cNo.\u201d Gu Xi smiled at the friendly inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Xi\u2019 as in cherish.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201d The girl smiled and introduced herself as well. \u201cMy name is Dong Mingming. Ming like the plant.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d said Gu Xi.\u201cHehe, same here.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, okay? Our class is very harmonious. I will introduce you to everyone in between classes,\u201d said Dong Mingming.Gu Xi nodded, showing her appreciation \u2013 she felt that Classmate Dong Mingming was one overly friendly one.\u201cOh yeah.\u201d As though something had just occurred to her, Dong Mingming leaned into Gu Xi and asked, \u201cAre you really a valedictorian?\u201dGu Xi felt a little dazed from the question.\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t know. As it happened, Teacher Chen mentioned to us yesterday that we will be getting a new classmate and that we should pick up some tips in studying from you.\u201cIf that\u2019s what she said, that means our new classmate must be a valedictorian,\u201d said Dong Mingming. When Teacher Chen announced this yesterday, she smiled like their class had, once again, became the top class among their grade.\u201cAnd then there is this spot. Teacher Chen freed it up yesterday.\u201d Everything had already been arranged well before the new student had started.That dawned on Gu Xi: No wonder she felt that the others\u2019 reactions were a bit odd. And then there was this spot\u2026 \u2026 also seemed abrupt.\u201cSo, are you really one of those that get top grades?\u201d asked Dong Mingming again curiously.\u201cI do alright.\u201d Gu Xi wasn\u2019t being too overly humble either.\u201cHehe, good. Then we can help each other out. It will be like joining forces with each other.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - Is \u201cGod Xiu\u201d referring to a student in this class? (3)\u201cOh right, we are having literature next and we have physics, English, and math today. Do you have your textbooks with you?\u201d asked Dong Mingming caringly.\u201cI do.\u201d The school had sent over the schedule to Gu Shao yesterday and he had given it to her.Gu Xi turned to dig through her backpack as she said that.Dong Mingming, next to her, seemed to have noticed something very mystical all of a sudden. She cocked her head and stuck it in front of Gu Xi in surprise, \u201cGu Xi, I noticed that your irises have a very interesting color.\u201dDong Mingming looked at Gu Xi from a few different angles to make sure that she was, indeed, seeing what she was seeing.Gu Xi\u2019s irises were of a light tan color. It was unnoticeably if one wasn\u2019t looking at them closely. But when one looked at them closely, one would notice that they were just a little different from the norm.\u201cAre you wearing contact lens?\u201d asked Dong Mingming.\u201cNo. This is their true color. I got that from my dad,\u201d explained Gu Xi. The corners of her lips lifted a little.Having said that, Gu Nian pulled out a few textbooks from her backpack.The textbooks were all knew.She had left her old textbooks from Liming back at home. These were the new ones that Gu Shao had prepared for her.They were the same textbooks but she was no longer \u201cLin Xi\u201d.Gu Xi flipped open to the first page of each textbook and scribbled the character \u201cGu Xi\u201d on each of them seriously.\u201cYour handwriting is pretty,\u201d said Dong Mingming next to her.She was about to say something else but the literature teacher had already walked inside of the classroom and looked over in their direction. Intimidated, Dong Mingming immediately stopped talking.The tallest grass gets cut first. She didn\u2019t want to be called upon by the literature teacher to recite what they had covered the day before.Dong Mingming scooted back to her spot quietly and pretended that \u201cnothing had happened and she had been reading quietly\u201d the entire time. That being said, she still reached her hand over stealthily when the literature teacher and moved her \u201cdeath stare\u201d away to show Gu Xi where they would be starting today in the textbook.***When the literature teacher started her lecture, Gu Xi, too, had refused her attention onto the textbook.The progress at this school was comparable to that of her previous one as was the lecture itself. Gu Xi only needed very little time to adjust before she followed the pace of the new teacher.***After the first class was over, Dong Mingming took the opportunity between classes to introduce Gu Xi to the others in the class one by one.Gu Xi, too, tried her best to remember the names and looks of everybody in class.Right then and there, ruckuses in the classroom caught Gu Xi\u2019s attention.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d She asked Dong Mingming.Dong Mingming, too, looked over in the direction where the noises came from. She then turned back around and explained to Gu Xi, \u201cThey are having wagers on during which period will God Xiu show up.\u201dGu Xi lifted her brows in surprised upon hearing that: \u201cGod Xiu\u201d referred to a student in this class? \u201cDuring which period will he show up\u201d\u2026 \u2026The classes here were that casual?Gu Xi grumbled to herself when she heard Dong Mingming added, \u201cJudging from their excitement, I gather that God Xiu will be arriving soon.\u201dDong Mingming hasn\u2019t even finished talking when a tall figure casually strolled into the classroom. The young man still looking groggy.\u201cSee? Am I right or am I right?\u201d said Dong Mingming.And those over on the other became even more excited than before.***Looking at the person, Gu Xi paused for a little and said, \u201cSheng Xiuyan?\u201d\u201cYou know each other?\u201d asked Dong Mingming.\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d said Gu Xi as she shook her head.She had only saw him once the day she took her entrance examination. She thought \u201cSheng Xiuyan\u201d was what Teacher Chen had called him.After Gu Xi said that she didn\u2019t know Sheng Xiuyan, Dong Mingming couldn't help but started gossiping about him with her.\u201cLet me tell you. He may seem uncaring but he was super mighty. His existence was like straight out of a textbook \u2013 great family background, good looking, and his grades\u2026 \u2026\u201d\u201cSuper good?\u201d Gu Xi completed her sentence for her.\u201cYes, super good. Why else would he be referred to as \u2018God Xiu\u2019? Let me tell you, he is entirely like a God of Academia.\u201d\u201cDo you know what my wish is?\u201d asked Dong Mingming.\u201cTo surpass Sheng Xiuyan?\u201d asked Gu Xi.Dong Mingming shook her head right away, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cI only hoped that the one day that my scores came in second, Sheng Xiuyan would have somehow missed that examination.\u201dSeeing the twitch of Gu Xi\u2019s lips and the you-are-exaggerating-it-too-much look on her, Dong Mingming knew that Gu Xi didn\u2019t believe her and added, \u201cI am not exaggerating. There is a saying at our school \u2013 the only way for Sheng Xiuyan to not score the highest is if he had missed the examination.\u201dHaving said that, Dong Mingming patted Gu Xi on her hand. \u201cI know you don\u2019t really get it just from listening to me. You will see what a landslide is during the next monthly examination.\u201dGu Xi, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dGu Xi glanced over at Sheng Xiuyan once again after Dong Mingming was done talking.

Keke.\u201d\u201cLook, Brother Yan, she\u2019s right over there.\u201d Someone pointed in the direction of Gu Xi.-- Just what does that have to do with me?Thought Sheng Xiuyan.That being said, he still looked over at the direction that the others were pointing at.Then, his gaze stopped.\u201cIt\u2019s her?\u201d It was the girl who had taken the monthly examination the same day as him.***The others were only casually chitchatting. Little did they expect Sheng Xiuyan to be staring at the new student. The others were dumbfounded and exchanged looks among themselves.\u2013\u2013 OMG! What is going on? Why is Brother Yan staring at her for such a long time?\u2013\u2013 I don\u2019t recall Brother Yan ever staring at anyone for that long before.\u2013\u2013 Did he fall for her? Is this love at first sight? Oh boy.When all the others were stunned, Sheng Xiuyan turned back around and saw all the gossipy looks on the other guys.\u201cBrother Yan, are you really interested in the new student?\u201d Someone asked softly.Sheng Xiuyan gave him a look of contempt before tossing out a, \u201cBrain dead.\u201dThe others, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d Alright. That was still that Brother Yan that they have known.They were mostly just joking nobody paid it much attention after that.The other boys quickly changed their subject to something else.\u201cOh right, Brother Yah. The other day when I walked past the office, I heard that Teacher Chen had you made up for the monthly examinations? Is that true?\u201d asked Zhou Bofan.\u201cThat is correct,\u201d said Sheng Xiuyan.As soon as he finished saying that, everybody looked regretful.\u201cOh boy, my ranking had gone from 378 to 377 this time. If you made up for the examinations, Brother Yan, you are putting me right back where I was before.\u201dWang Yankai was not the only one. Everybody in their grade moved forward by 1 rank because Sheng Xiuyan was absent for the examinations this one time.\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine on my end. I dropped almost 100 in my ranking this time and my parents beat me up in tandem when I went home. Since I have already been beaten, it didn\u2019t matter whether I drop one further.\u201d\u201cThat being said, Brother Yan. Did Lao Chen tell you your grades this time? What is your ranking?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d Sheng Xiuyan didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cNo #1 again, is it? We would like some surprises from time to time.\u201dSheng Xiuyan still didn\u2019t anything. His look, however, dropped a little visibly.\u2013\u2013 He saw the grade and had found out the ranking.Surprisingly enough, he was not #1 in their grade. He was ranked #2.Before he took his made-up examinations, Sheng Xiuyan had taken a look at the ranking for their grade when it was displayed. The #1 on there was from Class #17 and they scored at least 30 points lower than his total.If he was #2.Then there was only one explanation\u2026 \u2026Sheng Xiuyan looked back over at Gu Xi. The was only one person who could have scored higher than him.The others had no idea what was going through Sheng Xiuyan\u2019s mid. When they saw he looking at their new classmate again subconsciously, they were stunned \u2013 It was all over. Did Brother Yan really fall for the new girl at first sight?Our Brother Yan was for real?Our Brother Yan had truly fallen?Ignoring the looks from the others, Sheng Xiuyan looked away from her again, put his head down, and went to sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - She wasn't sure if it was her imagination, but she seemed to be followed. (2)The school day was over.Gu Xi adapted to the few classes quite well. She felt that she had returned to her state back in Liming.When school was over, Gu Xi put away her textbooks one by one, slugged her backpack over her shoulder and was about to take off.She had only gotten two steps in when she was stopped by Dong Mingming, her deskmate.\u201cGu Xiao Xi, why are you going to fast? Wait for me.\u201dDong Mingming held onto Gu Xi with one hand and picked up her speed at putting her textbooks and stationaries into her backpack.She also put on a sad look at the same time and grumbled, \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t try to leave behind your dearly beloved deskmate and just take off without her.\u201dOwing to Dong Mingming\u2019s super friendly personality, the two had only been deskmates for one day and the two already felt very familiar with each other.Gu Xi was dazed all of a sudden from Dong Mingming\u2019s words.\u201cNo... \u2026\u201d Gu Xi paused before she carried on. \u201cI was just thinking about a problem.\u201d\u201cWhat problem? The last math one that we just did? Why? Any way I\u2019ve tried to solve it, the answer is still 0.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d Gu Xi mumbled.She was just used to it.Back at Liming, owing to those rumors, less and less people wanted to talk to her over time and nobody wanted to walk with her either.As such, Gu Xi was already used to packing up quickly and leaving by herself as soon as the class was over.On the other hand, Dong Mingming was done packing.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go,\u201d said Dong Mingming as she held onto Gu Xi.The two walked outside of the school together.When they reached the front of the school, Dong Mingming spotted the car that came for her from a far and said goodbye to Gu Xi.\u201cMy car is here. I am going now. See you tomorrow.\u201dGu Xi, too, waved at her.***After she had parted with Dong Mingming, Gu Xi continued to walk toward the parking area on the east side of the school.Aunty Mei had told her this morning when she was on her way out that there would be a car picking her up from school afterward. She even texted the license plate number to her cellphone. Gu Xi looked around but had yet to locate it.***She took a few more steps and stopped suddenly.She couldn\u2019t be sure whether she was imagining it, but she felt that she was being followed.Gu Xi and Dong Mingming walked out earlier than the others and there weren\u2019t a lot of people on this road.If she was merely being followed, she could at least make some detours. But if they were trying to kidnap her, should she start running?All kind of crazy thoughts in Gu Xi\u2019s mind had successfully made her nervous.Gu Xi slowed down and pretended to look around casually. Then, after taking a few steps forward quickly, she stopped and whipped around abruptly.\u201cOdd\u2026 \u2026\u201dThere were a few other students walking behind her but nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary.The shadows of two people squatting down in awkward positions next to the wall not too far away had, nevertheless, caught Gu Xi\u2019s attention.The wo had on the same uniform as Gu Xi\u2019s so they were obviously also students of HSAU.\u201cAre couples that open now?\u201d Or that HSAU didn\u2019t care about their students being in relationships in a young age?Gu Xi mumbled to herself.From her angle, even though the two by the wall were squeezed together next to each other in an awkward position, they did look like a couple being affectionate with each other.Soon, Gu Xi noticed that something else was off.Those two students looked to be\u2026 \u2026 two boys?\u2013 I hope they were not in a fight.Thought Gu Xi to herself.Then again, that didn\u2019t seem to have much to do with her one way or another. As such, Gu Xi shook her head, looked away from them, and continued to walk over to the parking area as she occasionally looking at the license plates that drove past her.___Translator\u2019s rambling:Dum. Dum. Dum. Who are our MC's stalkers? :DPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - She had perfected demonstrated what guilty conscience looks like. (1)Over on this side, only after they saw that Gu Xi kept on walking did the two boys that looked like they were \u201cfighting\u201d separated from each other and looked nervously in Gu Xi\u2019s direction.\u201cWhew. Okay, she\u2019s gone finally.\u201d Gu Chenyi let out a sigh of relief.Before he was done talking, he was smacked upside his head by Gu Yanxiao. \u201cGu Chenyi, why the heck did you hide?\u201dGu Chenyi retorted, \u201cNonsense. Of course we have to hide. We don\u2019t want her to spot us, do we?\u201dHaving said that, Gu Chenyi looked again nervously in Gu Xi\u2019s direction and said to himself, \u201cXixi didn\u2019t notice us earlier, did she?\u201d\u201cAre you brain dead? Xixi had never seen us before. She wouldn\u2019t recognize us anyway, alright?\u201d said Gu Yanxiao. It would be odder when they looked like they had something to hide.That reminded Gu Chenyi.\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d Now he truly felt like a fool.\u201cWell, I was nervous, alright?\u201d said Gu Chenyi, embarrassed.Lucky they were spotted by anyone who knew that. His image that he had been maintained would be ruined.\u201cI feel that Xixi is even prettier in person than in her pictures,\u201d said Gu Chenyi. One way or another, those from their family were the best. He would not listen to anything otherwise.Gu Yanxiao nodded in agreement.That being said, he was a little disappointed. \u201cHow come Xixi didn\u2019t wear any of the clothes that we have picked out for her?\u201dAs soon as he had finished saying that, he immediately received a look of contempt from Gu Chenyi. \u201cThat is because the clothing that you picked out are too awful.\u201dWhat the Gu family members thought were pretty could make others speechless. Just because something was pink did not necessarily meant that it was pretty. Even if they were, too many of them could still be overwhelming!Those were what was going through Gu Chenyi\u2019s mind.As the only man in the Gu family who had somewhat of an acceptable taste in clothes, Gu Chenyi felt that it was difficult being him.Gu Yanxiao snickered coldly. \u201cI didn\u2019t see Xixi didn\u2019t wearing anything that you chose either!\u201dGu Chenyi, \u201cThe scrunchy that she was using was from me, alright!\u201dGu Yanxiao, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d He was defeated.Gu Chenyi was just feeling complacent when, suddenly, he felt Gu Yanxiao\u2019s arm wrapped around his neck, depressing it, and the two returned to their squatting position like they were scoundrels.\u201cOMG! Gu Yanxiao, what\u2019s the matter with you? Didn\u2019t you just say that we didn\u2019t need to hide?\u201d\u201cI saw Second Uncle\u2019s car!\u201d\u201cOh shoot\u2026 \u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and hide.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s make a run for it.\u201d\u201cBut what are we going to tell Grandpa if we didn\u2019t get any picture of her?\u201d***The two big boys squatting down next to the wall had already been spotted by others.A girl pointed at the two blobs and said to her girlfriend in surprise, \u201cDoes that person look like Gu Chenyi to you?\u201d\u201cNo way, surely you have mistaken.\u201d\u201cWell, see for yourself then,\u201d said the girl as she pointed at the two figures who ran away.Her girlfriend was taken aback a little then said, \u201cDid look somewhat like him from behind. But no way that would be Gu YuanChen.\u201dGu YuanChen has the status of being the school hunk. Why would he squat there in a corner after school? That seemed to be beneath him.\u201cGu Chenyi should be on the basketball field right now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Class #17 v Class #3 today. Gu Yanxiao should be there as well. Maybe we should go back to watch?\u201d\u201cOkay. Okay.\u201dThe few girls were boy crazed.***On the other side.Gu Xi looked around but failed to spot the car that Aunty Mei had mentioned to her. She did, however, noticed a car that looked very familiar.She double checked the license plate number and her eyes widened. She found that incredulous.Then she saw the car window being lowered and it was Gu Shao inside the car.\u201cDad!\u201d Gu Xi was pleasantly surprised.Gu Shao looked Gu Xi up and down and confirmed that she was unharmed.\u201cGet in.\u201d Gu Shao\u2019s tone was as concise as usual but the hint of tenderness around his eyes was unable to remain hidden.\u201cOkay,\u201d said Gu Xi as she got inside of the car.\u201cHow come you are here, Dad? Are you here to pick me up?\u201d asked Gu Xi with uncertainty. There was an anticipation in her eyes that even she didn\u2019t notice.\u201cI happened to be in the area so I thought I\u2019d swing by,\u201d said Gu Shao with a deep voice.Upon hearing that, Gu Xi nodded and sat down properly next to Gu Shao.Chen Ziyang, sitting in the front, smiled to himself.The professor had a technology seminar to attend to this afternoon and it was supposed to go till 5:30 PM.The professor had, however, taken off early for the sake of coming over to pick up Gu Xi.The professor was probably worried that Xiao Xi would be unaccustomed to the new school.Chen Ziyang, holding back his laugh, peeked at Gu Shao, sitting in the back, and then at Gu Xi, who was sitting docilely next to him, and felt a little envious all of a sudden.Why was it that he suddenly wanted a daughter of his own?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - She had perfected demonstrated what guilty conscience looks like. (2)In the backseats of the car.Neither one of the father and daughter said a word.A document pouch next to Gu Shao\u2019s hand suddenly caught Gu Xi\u2019s attention as she lowered her head.It looked somewhat familiar.Gu Xi thought about it some and she recalled: This looked a lot like the document pouch that was given to Gu Shao by the principal of Liming yesterday that contained all of her past academic work!Gu Xi glanced up and Gu Shao, who was on the phone, did not appear to be paying attention to her at the moment.As she was too curious, Gu Xi reached her hand over stealthily while Gu Shao was distracted, opened up a corner of the document pouch, and carefully peeked at the content inside of it.It was the copies of some of her awards and award certificates from when she was with that school and some documents from when she had participated in some competitions. And then there were some\u2026 essays that she had written in the past and some major homework assignments.Some of them were her award-winning essays and some were used as sample essays by the school.Gu Xi couldn\u2019t really recall exactly which of her essays or major homework assignments were retained by the school.Right when Gu Xi was about to flip through the corner and look, Gu Shao had already gotten off his call.Seeing that Gu Shao was looking over, Gu Xi quickly retrieved her hand and gave Gu Shao a I-don\u2019t-know-anything-nothing-is-going-ondry smile.\u201cHow\u2019s your new school?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cMmm.\u201d Gu Xi thought about it some and said with the corners of her lips raised. \u201cNot bad.\u201dGu Shao didn\u2019t ask any further and Gu Xi, on the other hand, started frantically trying to recall what she had written in her essays back at Liming.\u2013 Most of them were topics assigned by the school \u2013 scenes of their home villages, time, if you are so-and-so\u2026 \u2026Oh, right! Then there was one called \u201cMy Dream\u201d. She had written how her dream was to get in NTN Technology Center and then\u2026 became someone like Gu Shao.Having thought of that, Gu Xi\u2019s look froze on her face.There was nothing wrong with the content of her essay but, now that Gu Shao had become her father, thinking about that essay again made Gu Xi felt inexplicable shy and embarrassed.Gu Xi peeked carefully at Gu Shao. He probably still hadn\u2019t seen the content inside the pouch yet.Should she steal them from him?That idea flashed through Gu Xi\u2019s mind.Gu Shao, \u201cSomething\u2019s the matter?\u201dGu Xi, \u201cNo, nothing.\u201d***Back at home.That night, Gu Xi still had that document pouch on her mind. She started plotting about how she could \u201csteal\u201d it from Gu Shao.Inside the dining room, seeing how Gu Xi had retreated back into her bedroom and locked herself in there immediately after dinner, Aunty Mei was a little worried.\u201cSir, did little Miss Xi run into some unpleasantness at school today?\u201d asked Aunty Mei nervously.\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Gu Shao.From what he had learned from the school, Gu Xi seemed to have done alright on her first day at school.\u201cMaybe she is just tired,\u201d said Gu Shao.On the other side, inside of her bedroom, Gu Xi had her ear against her door, spying on what was going on outside.She waited until there were no more noises from the outside and the noise of a door closing. She figured that Gu Shao must have returned to his bedroom before she carefully opened up her room door.Through the crack of the door, Gu Xi peeked outside and quietly scooted outside when she was sure that she did not see Gu Shao around.She dashed toward his study as though she was doing a 100-meter sprint.She saw that Gu Shao had placed everything inside his study after he came home.Sure enough, the familiar document pouch was the first thing that Gu Xi saw lying on top of Gu Shao\u2019s desk.Gu Shao walked over quietly and even looked behind her from time to time.The document pouch in hand, Gu Xi was about to sneak back into her room.Then, suddenly, Gu Shao\u2019s voice rang from behind her.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dHearing Gu Shao\u2019s voice, Gu Xi, startled, her hand shuddered and she quickly put the document pouch where she found it and turned around with her hands behind her back.\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Gu Shao again.\u201cNothing,\u201d said Gu Shao while shaking her head.She perfectly demonstrated what \u201cguilty conscience\u201d looked like.\u201cEm, that, I need you to sign something for me,\u201d said Gu Xi.\u201cSure, give them to me.\u201d Gu Shao nodded.\u201cEm, I\u2019ve forgotten them in my room,\u201d said Gu Xi as she pointed in the direction of her room with guilty conscience. \u201cLet me go get them.\u201dSeeing that Gu Shao had nodded again, Gu Xi dashed out, back into her room, grabbed her homework assignments and returned to the study while feeling relieved the entire time: Lucky she was able to come up with a plausible reason quickly.\u201cYou need to sign these.\u201d Gu Xi handed her homework assignments over to Gu Shao while still staring intensely at the document pouch lying on the corner of his desk.Gu Shao, after taking the homework assignments from Gu Xi, flipped it open.Her handwriting was very pretty and her entire homework notebook looked very neat. Each stroke of hers clearly demonstrated her seriousness.Her mannerism and attitude made her a good fit for performing scientific research was the idea that crossed Gu Shao\u2019s mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - She had perfected demonstrated what guilty conscience looks like. (3)After going through Gu Xi\u2019s homework assignments from beginning to end, Gu Shao finally signed his name on the very bottom with his vigorous and powerful writing.\u201cAnything else?\u201d He asked.\u201cNo, just these.\u201d Gu Xi took back her homework notebook and her practice notebook. Clutching them in front of her chest, she said \u201cgoodnight\u201d to Gu Shao before she turned and left.She had not forgotten to give the document pouch one last look before she walked out.While Gu Shao was going through her homework assignments, Gu Xi took the opportunity when he was distracted and moved two books on the table over the document pouch.She hoped that it would be out of sight and out of mind for Gu Shao.After all, it wasn\u2019t anything important as far as Gu Shao was concerned.Gu Xi returned to her room as she was thinking about that.***After returning to her bedroom, Gu Xi looked at the homework notebook that Gu Shao had signed from her just a little while ago, dazed.\u2013 Truth was, Gu Shao has been truly nice to her.When she first came looking for Gu Shao, she only hoped that he wasn\u2019t a complete villain as described in the novel. Her ask was simple \u2013 for Gu Shao to be her legal guardian until she was of age.Nevertheless, Gu Shao had, so far, provided for her way more than what she had expected.He let her moved in with him; he took care of the transfer of her household register and her to her new school in person; he had Grandma Mei come to look after her; he bought her new textbooks; he asked her about her thought and would drop her off and pick her up from school.What more could one ask from a father?In addition, Gu Xi started to wonder: Perhaps he was the natural villain because he was antagonizing the male and female leads when, in reality, Gu Xi hadn\u2019t noticed anything bad about Gu Shao.If, in the future, the events described in the novel truly took place and Lin Yize was going to target Gu Shao, she wished that nothing bad would happen to Gu Shao.After thinking about that some, Gu Xi pulled out her cell phone and logged into the Battle at the Summit of Tianchuang chatgroup.[X]: Channel owner, I have given it some thoughts. I can join your team in the Tianchuang Competition. I might not be too technical in some areas but I will do my best to learn as much as I can, if you don\u2019t mind, that is.As soon as Gu Xi had sent that over and, before she could even start typing the next line, [AAA], on the other side, had already responded instantly.He responded with multiple messages to be precise:[AAA]: ! ! ![AAA]: For realz?![AAA]: That\u2019s awesome! I love you, Bro X! I have been waiting for you to say that for so long!Looking at how exciting [AAA] was, Gu Xi couldn't help but stressed again: I really am not an expert in this field.[AAA]: responded instantly again: That doesn\u2019t matter.He found the few ideas that Gu Xi had come up with earlier pretty impressive already.[AAA]: We have [Lin] for the technical stuff. You don\u2019t need to worry about that![X]: Okay.[X]: Em\u2026 \u2026Gu Xi found it a bit awkward to broach what she wanted to say next.[X]: Can I take 300,000 yuan of the prize money if we win?Weak, humble, and full of anticipation.\u2013 Gu Xi had thought it through. In the novel, both her going offline and Lin Yize started targeting Gu Shao took place when she was about to become of age.Truth was, she didn\u2019t have a lot of time. Relying only on just some of the prize money for students and her scholarship money, she would not be able to save up much before she turned 18. There wouldn\u2019t be much of a safety net to speak of.She needed to save more. That way, even if Lin Yize bankrupted Gu Shao in the future, she would still have enough money to support both him and herself.Speaking of, should she look for an opportunity to warn Gu Shao to watch out for Lin Yize?Gu Xi thought to herself.At the same time, [AAA] sent over another message: The prize money is nothing. We don\u2019t even need to split it. You can have all of it when we win!Even [Lin], who rarely said a word in the group, chimed in: That works.[AAA]: @X, where are you based out of?Gu Xi thought about it some and didn\u2019t feel the need to hide that fact, so she responded with: City B.[AAA]: What a coincidence![AAA]: We are based out of City B as well.[AAA]: Perfect. [Lin] was back too. Let us brothers meet up when we have some free time. We can have a ceremony for the forming of our team and also talk about matters with regards to the competition.[Lin]: I am busy.[AAA]: Haven\u2019t you completed all of your academic requirements over at Country M ahead of time? You shouldn\u2019t be busy right now.[Lin]: You don\u2019t understand.He even included a rare complacent emoji after that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - She had perfected demonstrated what guilty conscience looks like. (4)Gu Xi noticed that the two of them seemed to know each other.When the two of them started chatting among themselves, Gu Shao logged out of the group chat and got ready for bed.As for the meeting that 3A had mentioned, Gu Xi had decided against it after some thought.She worried that they would find out that she was just a noob who hasn\u2019t even graduated high school yet and didn\u2019t want her on their team.That being said, Gu Nian started planning in her head that she needed to bring up her level of technicality. Ideally, she would be able to get her hands on some professional books or sit in some courses and learn them in a systematic manner.Gu Xi had fallen asleep as she contemplated.On the other side, inside the study, Gu Shao were reading the documents on Gu Xi.***At this very moment, Gu Shao had, in his hand, another essay by Gu Xi.It was an essay for the mid-term examination. This one, along with those from a few other students, were selected by the school as samples for the others.The title was \u201cHome\u201d.Gu Shao looked at the title for a few seconds before he continued to read the content.It was still her neat and feminine handwriting with a few paragraphs in the middle that attracted his attention.\u201cDad is quiet and study. He doesn\u2019t talk much normally but he loves every one at home very much. He would come to my defense immediately when I made mistakes; bring home the cake that I like on his way home from work every day; he would leave his work behind and come celebrate my birthday, he had never missed one of my birthdays nor had he ever missed any of my performances; he would praise me every time I win an award and also\u2026 \u2026\u201cMy mom\u2019s love has always been delicate and tender. She would take care of me, always; stay by me at night when I am ill; be the first to stand in front of me when I was bullied\u2026 \u2026\u201cThen there\u2019s my grandma [paternal] and grandmother [maternal]\u2026 \u2026\u201dIt was a very simple essay on her family and the happiness between the words and lines were infectious.Except that\u2026 \u2026Gu Shao frowned and his hand that was holding onto the essay tightened a little.From the timeline, he was obviously not the \u201cDad\u201d mentioned in the essay.Nor was she talking about anyone from the Lin family.Or that Gu Xi was merely writing how \u201cMom and Dad\u201d were supposed to be like from Lin Anxin\u2019s perspective. They were merely the \u201chome\u201d in her imagination and one that she would like to have.***Gu Xi was taken to school by Gu Shao again the next day.On her way to school, Gu Xi was on her phone.After she had expressed interest in teaming up with [AAA], he had sent over several GB worth of information. Allegedly they were information on the winning designs for the last few years that he had spent a lot of time in putting together.Right at this moment, [AAA] was describing each and every single one to her one at a time.***Next to her, Gu Shao\u2019s look turned solemn when he noticed that Gu Xi had been staring at her cellphone.\u201cDon\u2019t read on your cellphone in the car,\u201d said Gu Shao.Over the last few days, Gu Xi had somewhat gotten used to Gu Shao\u2019s solemnness and would not get as nervous as she used to. She still, however, stuck her tongue out and put her phone away docilely after he had said that.Gu Shao looked away from her upon seeing that.After a little while, Gu Shao asked suddenly, \u201cYou wanted to join NTN Technology Center?\u201dGu Nian, \u201c! ! !\u201dThat came to her as a shock.\u2013\u2013 Gu Shao had found out? He read that essay of her?Gu Xi\u2019s face froze. Had there been a hole on the bottom of the car, she very much would like to crawl inside and bury herself in there.There was nothing wrong with the essay. It was just\u2026 \u2026 too embarrassing.Gu Xi couldn\u2019t quite describe why she felt that way. It sort of felt like a child writing something to the effect of \u201cI love Mommy and Daddy\u201d, \u201cMy Dad is so might\u201d, or \u201cMy Mom is so pretty\u201d, etc. and didn\u2019t think anything would find out but later on discovered that their parents had been \u201cchecking\u201d on their diaries every day.Or that they had been texting their idols every day thinking that they would not read them at all but just to say them to make themselves feel better and, lo and behold, the idol replied to them one day\u2026 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - \"Who's Gu Xi's love bento from?\" (1)\u201cI guess so,\u201d said Gu Xi softly.She rubbed her burning ear subconsciously before she said in a feigned nonchalant, \u201cI have read some articles on NTN Technology Center in the past and felt that it was a mighty place and I hope that I will also one day become a mighty person and join NTN Technology Center.\u201dHaving said that, she even gave Gu Shao a nonchalant smile that gave herself away.Gu Shao didn\u2019t not comment on what Gu Xi had said.That being said, at an angle that Gu Xi could not see, the corner of Gu Shao\u2019s lips curved ever so slightly upward.Returning quickly to his solemn look, Gu Shao said to Gu Xi seriously, \u201cGetting into NTN Technology Center is not easy.\u201dThat was the truth \u2013\u2013 unlike Talent training and research mechanism in colleges and universities, NTN Technology Center represented the most cutting edge technology in the Chinese market. They basically recruited elites in the field and even entry level personnel must meet a minimum requirement.That, however, was not what Gu Shao was trying to tell Gu Xi.\u201cYou can make your own decision. Do keep in mind that you have your entire life in front of you and you don\u2019t need to be limited in just one direction,\u201d said Gu Shao seriously.In the past, when Gu Xi was with the Lin family, she studied hard, she gave it her best in everything that she did and get the top scores\u2026 \u2026 Being a child seeking their parents approval was majority of the reason.Gu Shao wasn\u2019t certain whether Gu Xi\u2019s goal of \u201cbecoming a great researcher in technology and enter NTN Technology Center\u201d was part of her effort of trying to appease the adults.But, being with him, she did not need to do that.He did not need to measure his own child with a ruler nor did he need her to be \u201cextremely outstanding\u201d in the eyes of the others.\u201cYou can do what you enjoy doing,\u201d added Gu Shao.Gu Xi was taken aback a little when she heard that but, when she figured out what Gu Shao was trying to say, her eyes beamed again.The very next second, she cracked open her mouth and smiled at Gu Shao. \u201cOkay, I understand what you mean but I wasn\u2019t lying. This is what I want to do.\u201dAs though worried that Gu Shao would not believe her, she stressed again, \u201cReally!\u201dThis time it was Gu Shao who was taken aback. If he remembered correctly, girls her age should be more interested in singing, dancing, or drawing, or dream to become a star.That was what Gu Shao read about the most online.Gu Shao looked over at Gu Xi. The seriousness and excitement in the girl\u2019s eyes looked genuine.***Gu Shao looked away from her. While talking about essays, he recalled the last essay that he read the night before.\u2013\u2013 family huh\u2026 \u2026Gu Shao lowered his eyes some.Even if the entire essay was conjured up from Gu Xi\u2019s imagination, or based on how the Lin family members treated Lin Anxin and was far from the truth, it was not difficult to read a child\u2019s desire for family and love from the embellishment of her maternal grandmother Zhang Cui and paternal grandmother Xu Jiaofeng.Recalling the call that Old Mr. Gu had Butler Zhou made, Gu Shao thought about it some and said, \u201cYou are coming with me to your grandfather\u2019s place this Mid-Autumn festival.\u201dGu Xi was dazed when she heard that. That her look was filled with surprise.Even though Gu Shao was the only person on his household register, Gu Xi did not give it much thought, nor did it occur to her that he might have other family members.When Gu Shao brought up \u201cgrandfather\u201d out of the blue, that was when Gu Xi suddenly realized that Gu Shao should have other family members.That was mentioned a little in the novel but not a lot was said about it.Something along the line of bad things happening to his family after he had been crushed by the male lead.Even though she has yet to meet them and not much was said about them in the novel but, perhaps because of the blood-and-flesh filter, Gu Xi felt that the Gu family members should be nice people.The ending in the novel made her worry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - \"Who's Gu Xi's love bento from?\" (2)Next to her, Gu Shao had no idea what was going through Gu Xi\u2019s head. He mistook her frown as her feeling nervous and anxiety from the idea of having to meet with other Gu family member that she didn\u2019t know from before.\u201cIt\u2019s not that scary,\u201d said Gu Shao. At least the Gu family wasn\u2019t like the Lin family.\u201cHmm? What?\u201d Gu Xi turned to look at Gu Shao after she had recollected herself.\u201cOver on the Gu family side, there\u2019s my dad, which is your grandpa, your big uncle\u2019s side, and your little uncle side. Three boys in total, about the same age as you\u2026\u2026\u201d As she had not yet met them, Gu Shao merely gave her an overview of the Gu family members to let know that things over there was not that complicated.That being said, Gu Xi made a mental note of everything that Gu Shao had told her.\u201cDo you have pictures of them?\u201d She asked.\u201cNo.\u201d Pausing a little, Gu Shao went on, \u201cYou will see them on the day of.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Gu Xi nodded. She turned on her cellphone and checked on the date of Mid-Autumn Festival. It was just two weeks away.\u201cDo you need to give them a heads up about me?\u201d Gu Xi asked again in a soft voice. After all, a granddaughter had just popped up out of nowhere. Came to think about it, that seemed kind of abrupt.\u201cThey know of you,\u201d said Gu Shao as he looked out at a certain direction outside of the car window.\u2013\u2013 Old Mr. Gu had arranged people to come around the school and even made a sneak trip himself yesterday when it was around the time the school let out. Did he really don\u2019t think that Gu Shao would find out?After a slight pause, Gu Shao went on to say, \u201cGrandpa and the others like you a lot.\u201dUpon hearing that, Gu Xi\u2019s eyes widened and her look was filled with surprise. \u201cReally?\u201dOr was he only saying that because he worried that she would be nervous.Those from the Gu family hadn\u2019t even met her yet. How would they like her already? She had been with her two grandmothers at the Lin family for a long, long time and they didn\u2019t even like her.\u201cReally,\u201d said Gu Shao affirmatively. Then, \u201cWe are here.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Gu Xi recollected herself and noticed that they had already arrived outside of the school.\u201cGo now.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d said Gu Xi as she gave Gu Shao a smile. Jumping out of the car, she waved at him and said, \u201cBye, Dad.\u201dAfter she was done saying goodbye to Gu Shao, Gu Xi waved at Xu Fei in the front and said to him, \u201cBye, Uncle Xiao Fei.\u201dXu Fei, who was trying to figure out the content in his friend's circle, almost didn\u2019t notice Gu Xi saying bye to him.After waving at Gu Xi, Xu Fei looked back at his cellphone and continued to try to make sense of the two articles that his boss had posted to his friend's circle.The two articles were The Effects of Parents on Their Children and The Importance of Genetics in Children\u2019s Future Development?!Gu Shao rarely post anything to his friend's circle at all and, even when he did, the content was mostly related to new products or new technologies or perhaps technical articles.Xu Fei had been studying these two articles the entire night and noticed that, other than these being soft skills from some so-called \u201cexperts\u201d that were actually click baits and one even complete with a link to some baby formulas, he failed to notice what was so special about them.Had his boss not responded to one of the comments with a \u201cmake sense\u201d in his regular tone, he would strong suspect that his boss\u2019s account had been hacked.In the backseat, Gu Shao waited until he saw Gu Xi had walked through the entrance to her school before he said to the chauffeur, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Head to A University first.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - \"Who's Gu Xi's love bento from?\" (3)On the other side, Gu Xi went her classroom after she had parted with Gu Shao.It wasn\u2019t too early when Gu Xi arrived at the school and, as such, there were already quite some people in the classroom when she got there.What baffled Gu Xi was why these people were surrounding her desk instead of getting ready for class.Someone noticed Gu Xi before she walked over and shouted out, \u201cShe\u2019s here. She\u2019s here. The center of discussion is here now~\u201dWhat is going on?Gu Xi grumbled suspiciously to herself as she walked over to the crowd.The other students in the class voluntarily made a path for Gu Xi to get through.The only problem was the gossipy smiles on them when they looked at her gave her the creeps.Gu Xi walked all the way to the seat before she noticed the breakfast gift package on her desk.Why did she call it a gift package?Because the box was huge and had a lot of varieties. In addition to just breakfast, it also had snacks and other crackers.The cherry-pink, cherry-shaped lunch box also came with non-disposable utensil. It was very eye-catching.Dong Mingming came over at this moment and held onto Gu Xi with a gossipy look.\u201cNot bad! You got someone sending you love bento on your second day of school!\u201d Having said that, Tong Mianmian lowered her voice and asked curiously, \u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Gu Xi was dumbfounded as well. She looked over at the others and asked, \u201cDo you know?\u201dEverybody shook their heads.\u201cI was the first one here and it was already here when I arrived.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s it from? Breakfast early in the morning. That\u2019s so doting!\u201d\u201cKeke. Could it be someone who has a crush on Gu Xi?\u201d After all, with Gu Xi\u2019s looking, it would make total sense that someone was crushing on her.\u2026 \u2026Everybody plunged back into gossips again.Luckily, the bell rang and their morning study time had started. Everybody stopped gossiping and returned awkwardly to their own spots.After Gu Xi had seated, Dong Mingming stuck her head over and asked softly, \u201cBe honest, Gu Xiao Xi. Do you really not know who it\u2019s from?\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d Gu Xi shook her head.\u201cThat\u2019s so odd then.\u201d It was a bit of a stretch to say that it was from someone who had a crush on her. Gu Xi had, after all, only been here for a day. Many outside of their class wasn\u2019t even aware of her.\u201cDo you know anyone from our school?\u201dGu Xi shook her head again. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cMaybe they\u2019ve put it on the wrong spot?\u201d The package in front of her gave Gu Xi a headache. She had no idea what to do with it.\u201cWhat are you going to do with it then?\u201d asked Dong Mingming.Gu Xi thought about it some and said, \u201cTurn it into loss and found, I guess.\u201dDong Mingming, \u201cGood idea\u2026\u2026\u201d Except that this gift package looked so delicious. She really wanted to eat it. What should she do?***On the other side of the classroom, Wang Yankai looked over at Gu Xi, then at Sheng Xiuyan, who was now sleeping on his desk, and couldn't help but started discussion softly.\u201cSay, that wouldn\u2019t be from Brother Yan, would it?\u201d After all, they had all witnessed Sheng Xiuyan\u2019s \u201cfall\u201d the day before.\u201cComing early to drop off the lunch bento, took off, and then returning to the classroom again as if nothing had happened. Keke.\u201d*\u201cPerhaps. Why else would Brother Yan be here before the first class today?\u201dThe few talked among themselves in a low voice.Luckily Sheng Xiuyan was asleep at the time. Had he heard their conversation, he very well might call them \u201cbrain dead\u201d.***Gu Xi was called to the office by her class teacher in between classes.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Teacher Chen?\u201d asked Gu Xi.Teacher Chen put on a very friendly smile when she saw Gu Xi and said, \u201cOh, you are here. C\u2019mon over, Gu Xi. I want to talk to you about something.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - He was just about to ask Gu Chenyi who this Gu Xi was. (1)Once Gu Xi had walked over to her class teacher, the class teacher said to her, \u201cWell, next week is City B\u2019s Joint Science Competition. You know about that, right?\u201dGu Xi nodded, \u201cI do.\u201dThis Joint Science Competition was a joint event hosted by the top 26 first and second tier academically-focused junior high schools in City B.It was hosted at the same time every year.Gu Xi represented Liming last year. As such, she was aware of this competition.Seeing that Gu Xi had nodded, the class teacher smiled and carried on, \u201cThis time our plan is to have 2, 3, and 3 representatives from freshman to junior year, respectively. Our grade will have 3 openings\u2026\u2026\u201dAs she listened to her class teacher\u2019s explanation, Gu Xi recalled the format of the competition some. This joint competition was different from other ones in that it spanned three days. The first wo days would be on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology individually as well as portion with time-limit on the last day.Each participating school would send 8 representatives and each school could decide on the makeup of their team.For the first two days, each school would send three of their team members for each individual subject and, on the very last day, each team would send two members to compete in answering as many questions as possible within the time limit.The final outcome will be determined by the sum of all these examinations.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking. I planned to put in yours and Sheng Xiuyan\u2019s name from our class.\u201d The class teacher detailed her plan out.Sheng Xiuyan happened to walk into the office right at this moment.\u201cHere I thought you\u2019d come after I was done talking,\u201d said the class teacher as she gave Sheng Xiuyan a stare.\u201cI am not going to repeat the part that you have missed. You and Gu Xi will be representing our school as well as Class #7 in the Joint Science Competition. Give it your best, okay?\u201dEven though the nomination would still have to be approved by the school but these two from her class were the top two of their grades. There shouldn\u2019t be any questions.\u201cWhatever,\u201d said Sheng Xiuyan casually.The class teacher ignored him. Turning to Gu Xi, she asked her softly, \u201cWhat about you, Gu Xi. Any questions?\u201d\u201cNo, no questions.\u201d Gu Xi nodded.Except that\u2026 \u2026\u201cIs there prize money associated with this competition?\u201d Gu Xi, after a little struggle, finally asked the question that she cared about the most.Liming offered respective prize money for these types of competitions.As soon as Gu Xi had finished saying that, Sheng Xiuyan, standing next to her, looked over at her and contempt could be seen in his eyes: vulgar.The class teacher, on the other hand, didn\u2019t mind that at all.As far as she was concerned, a good student could do no wrong. Even if her concern was prize money, surely, she only wanted the money to buy herself more reference books.After all, a family like Gu Xi\u2019s has no shortage of money and the prize money was more of token than anything else.\u201cOf course,\u201d said the class teacher as she winked. \u201cIn fact, our school offers more than all the other schools.\u201dGu Nian nodded solemnly. She has no more questions then.***Gu Xi returned to her class.Dong Mingming scooted over curiously again and asked, \u201cWhat did Lao Chen want from you\u201d\u201cTo participate in the Joint Science Competition,\u201d replied Gu Xi.Upon hearing that, Dong Mingming looked surprised, \u201cOh mi, Gu Xiao Xi, it looks like you are no ordinary valedictorian.\u201dIn a competition where only two to three individuals were picked, a valedictorian like herself only qualified for an observer role.\u201cOh right. You returned to the classroom same time as God Xiu. Is he going to be participating in the joint competition as well?\u201d\u201cMmhmm.\u201d Gu Xi nodded.Dong Mingming patted Gu Xi on her shoulder. \u201cCongratulations. With God Xiu there, you can just win effortlessly.\u201dGu Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHere she thought Dong Mingming was going to make some serious comments\u2026\u2026Why didn\u2019t she say that he was the one who could win effortlessly because of her?Thought Gu Xi to herself.Even though HSAU was the one who won first prize the previous year, but she was at least the one who scored the highest in the time-limit portion on day 3, alright?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - He was just about to ask Gu Chenyi who this Gu Xi was. (2)With the celebrity effect, the news of Sheng Xiuyan being in the Joint Science Competition spread quickly to all the classes.Gu Xi, as the tagalong, was also mentioned.\u201cGu Xi? Which Gu Xi?\u201d\u201cA sophomore? No, I have never heard of her before. Why isn\u2019t Yan Xu from their class or Zou Le from Class #8?\u201d said someone in another class after reading the latest news on the school forum.Gu Chenyi, who had been playing on his cellphone leisurely jumped up all of a sudden.\u201cWho did you say are going?\u201d\u201cSheng Xiuyan, of course. Who else?\u201d replied someone.\u201cNo, the other one. Did you say Gu Xi?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d The person nodded. He was just about to whether Gu Chenyi knew this Gu Xi and who Gu Xi was when he saw Gu Chenyi stretched his hand out at him.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cRegistration form.\u201dGu Xi went over to the school library during lunch break.\u201cGu Xiao Xi, are you looking for reference books? What are you looking for? I can lend you mine,\u201d said Dong Mingming who had followed Gu Xi there.She paused for a little and added, \u201cLet me tell you. Our school library is really not that impressive. The selections are poor and they don\u2019t bring in new ones very often. You won\u2019t be able to find the latest reference books here.\u201dHSAU was really behind in this area when compared to the school next door to them.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I am just browsing,\u201d said Gu Xi with a smile.She didn\u2019t go to the library for textbooks or reference books. She was there for any entry level books on electronic technology.Now that she had decided to join [AAA] and [Lin] in the Tianchuang Competition, she wanted to level herself up on the basics as much as possible.She understood the concepts and theories but she lacked accrual of basic knowledge. Attending a technical school was obviously not feasible. As such, all she could do was to learn on her own from some textbooks.That being said, Gu Xi was somewhat disappointed after walking around the library \u2013\u2013 exactly as Dong Mingming had said, there were a lot of selections in the library and most of them had to do with junior high school subjects. The few books they had on electronic technology were limited to expansion of popular science.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d said Gu Xi to Dong Mingming.Gu Xi regretted not being able to find the books that she was looking for but still picked up a mathematics reference book for junior year to take with her.Looking at the book that Gu Xi had picked up, Dong Mingming was very surprised \u2013\u2013 It was said that God Xiu had also completed junior year\u2019s curriculum ahead of time. Was Gu Xi going o be like Sheng Xiuyan and also finish up junior year\u2019s curriculum ahead of time?***When the two of them walked out of the library, a group of people nearby caught Gu Xi\u2019s attention.\u201cWhat is going on over there?\u201d asked Gu Xi with her brows raised as she looked at the big crowd of people.Dong Mingming, too, were looking in that direction. She responded to Gu Xi\u2019s question, \u201cI guess Art Festival is around the corner and they are getting ready over there.\u201dHaving said that, Dong Mingming pointed at someone in the middle of the crowd and said, \u201cSee that group of people standing at the very front? They belong to our Art Club. And that one in the middle who Is not in an uniform? The one in the light blue dress? She is Gu XueEr, head of the art club. She\u2019s part of junior class #2.\u201cThe legendary beauty queen of HSAU.\u201dHaving said that, Dong Mingming was excited all of a sudden and gossipy aura radiated from her.\u201cLet me tell you,\u201d said Dong Mingming softly to Gu Xi as she put her arm around Gu Xi\u2019s. \u201cThis Gu XueEr is a celebrity at our school. It was said that men she turned down everyday are enough to wrap around our school three times\u2026\u2026\u201dAll in all, all phrases about being pretty with nice singing voice, alabaster skin and pretty, multi-talented, kind and loving, good temperament, etc. etc. were all for Gu XueEr.\u201cSo you are a fan of hers?\u201d asked Gu Xi.Gu Xi never paid much attention to topics like these in school. These were not things that interested her.\u201cNo, not really.\u201d Dong Mingming quickly shook her head.She thought this Gu XueEr was alright. Gu XueEr was alright right from her looks alone. The \u201cprettiest\u201d in school was a bit much but, if one was to throw in temperament, the way she dressed herself, her talents, and friendliness, then there was no problem with her being the beauty queen.\u201cOh, right!\u201d As though something had just occurred to her, Dong Mingming said again, \u201cThere were rumors before that she and God Xiu dated in the past. Keke. Someone claimed that they saw her gifting things to Sheng Xiuyan.\u201cAnd that Gu XueEr\u2019s best friend went over to talk to Sheng Xiuyan but nobody knew what his response was.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Why did he feel that his boss had been very out of character as of late? (1)Looking at how excited Dong Mingming was in gossiping, Gu Xi\u2019s lips twitched. She patted Dong Mingming on her shoulder and really wanted to tell her that dating at such a young age was just wrong.As it turned out, Gu Xi didn\u2019t even have the chance to say those words out before the group walked over to them.Someone stopped the two of them.\u201cHi there, fellow schoolmate, we are working on a Wall of Smiles for our Art Festival next month. Our goal is to put people\u2019s smiling pictures on a display wall.\u201d One of the girls explained to Gu Xi and Dong Mingming. She then asked, \u201cCan we can picture of the two of you?\u201dGu Xi and Dong Mingming exchanged a look.Right at this moment, Gu XueEr, who had just finished the props walked over. She seemed to have been taken aback a little when she saw Gu Xi but recovered quickly.Giving the two of them a friendly smile, she said to them, \u201cThis is a very meaningful activity. We will be placing the Wall of Smiles in front of the largest wall at the Art Festival\u2019s main venue. It will look amazing. You can think of it as your contribution toward the Art Festival.\u201cNor would you need to feel embarrassed. The wall will be huge and there will be many other students up there with you.\u201dOne must say that this Beauty Queen was quite convincing.\u201cOh, alright then.\u201d Gu Xi and Dong Mingming nodded.\u201cAwesome.\u201d Gu XueEr smiled and called out to another student, \u201cCan you take a picture of them?\u201dGu Xi and Tong Mianmian followed the other student to the front of the props.Gu XueEr ran back over with two headgears in her hands.\u201cOh, I almost forgot. Why don\u2019t you put this on too?\u201dOne was a green alien and the other was a small sunflower. Both of them were hollowed out in the middle for the head to fit inside.Dong Mingming, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Why did she feel that this was a set up all along?Gu Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Is it too late to run away now?After the photos were taken, the two \u201cyoungsters\u201d returned to their classroom.Dong Mingming was still going on and on about it, \u201cDo you think my life-long reputation is going to be ruined by that headgear?\u201cWhat am I going to do? The photo wall will be placed at the most eye-catching location at the venue. It will be so embarrassing if anyone sees them!\u201cI looked on our way out. There were bunny ones, Hello Kitty\u2026 \u2026 all of the other cute ones. Why did they have to give me such an ugly one?\u201dGu Xi patted Dong Mingming on her shoulder again to express that she did want to say anything. At the very minimum, Dong Mingming got the little sunflower one. What about her bizarre ET one?That being said, the two quickly forgot about this encounter.***After school that afternoon, Gu Xi saw the familiar-looking car parked not too far away when she walked out of the school.She parted ways with Dong Mingming and hopped into the car.She, however, did not see Gu Shao in the car.\u201cUncle Xiao Fei,\u201d said Gu Xi. She wondered why Gu Xi wasn\u2019t there when Xu Fei was there in the passenger seat.\u201cHow\u2019s your day at school today, Xiao Xi?\u201d\u201cNot bad,\u201d said Gu Xi with a smile.Noticing the disappointment in Gu Xi\u2019s smile, Xu Fei quickly figured it out and explained, \u201cBoss was going to come pick you up but there were some last-minute issues during the product testing and Boss was called away. He had me come to pick you up first.\u201dWhat he said made Gu Xi somewhat nervous. \u201cProduct testing? Is everything okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all fine.\u201d Xu Fei waved his hand then carried on to say, \u201cWe figured out that the issue laid with a connecting part and we are handling it right now as we speak. It shouldn\u2019t take long.\u201dGu Xi nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - Why did he feel that his boss had been very out of character as of late? (2)As he had to take care of the issues with the product, Gu Shao had yet to go home.After dinner, Gu Xi discussed the Tianchuang Competition with [AAA] and [Lin] from her room.With less than 10 minutes of discussion, the three decided on the project they would use to enter the competition. To be more precise, Brother [3A] was the one who made the decision.[AAA]: Okay, then. Our project will be smart butler company system.This \u2018Smart Butler Companion System\u2019 was an upgrade from Gu Xi\u2019s earlier idea \u2013\u2013 to put it simply, it would somewhat resemble an AI smart butler. This Smart Butler line would only be 70% programmed when they leave the factory and the remaining 30% would be reserved for self-learning and upgrading later on.The Smart Butler would self-teach and update based on information gathered during everyday usage. It would allow the Smart Butler to better adapt to the individual user\u2019s personality, preference, and habits.The final out come would be 50% basic smart service and 50% tailored companionship service.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201dThat was it?

Was that a little on the sloppy side?Gu Xi grumbled to herself.She was about to send a message to see if they would like to give it some more thoughts when [Lin], too, sent a message at this point: I think that will work.And the very important decision had been made just like that.[AAA]: Oh right. The registration starts today. Don\u2019t forget.[AAA] reminded the others in their chat.Today was the first day of registration for the Tianchuang Competition. For the purpose of authenticity of the contestant\u2019s information or anyone just tagging along by name, each contestant would have to fill out their own application.Regardless of how teams were formed or who were on the same team, each contestant was required to fill out their own application on the official website. Once they have received an entry code, they would be able to enter that into their team.***Gu Xi visited the official website and clicked into the registration page.The initial application and verification were simple and all the contestants needed to fill out were basic information such as their names, ID numbers, etc.Gu Xi hesitated for a little before keying in her own name and ID number, hoping for the best.As luck would have it, she saw a message popped up the very next second [Your ID information does not match the requirement. Please enter your correct ID information.]\u201cDidn\u2019t think so\u2026\u2026\u201d The minimum age requirement for this competition was 16.Gu Xi had never thought about it when she only wanted to chat with others in the forum. She hesitated for a while in front of the computer screen and finally filled in the other ID number that she could recall.She was able to made it through the registration this time.She logged out of the group chat after she had provided them with her entry code.***She went and took and look outside and Gu Shao still wasn\u2019t home yet. Gu Xi wandered over to outside of Gu Shao\u2019s study.Hesitated for a little while outside of the study, Gu Xi finally decided against going in there. She merely peeked inside of it from the entrance.All she wanted to do was to see what kind of books were on the shelf.She had been to Gu Shao\u2019s study twice before and noticed that most of the books on the shelf in the back seemed to be on electronic technology.Most of them were advanced ones. She didn\u2019t know whether there might be some entry-level ones.Gu Xi stretched her neck out, stared at the names on the book and looked at them shelf by shelf.\u201cCutting edge electronics\u2026\u2026\u201d Too advanced.\u201cE-type LL chip\u2026\u2026\u201d That, too, was too advanced.\u2026\u2026She finally saw a few books that looked like they might be entry-level ones at the very end.Unfortunately, Gu Xi didn\u2019t have the chance to catch their names before Gu Shao had returned home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - Why did he feel that his boss had been very out of character as of late? (3)He had spent some time over at NTN Technology Center fixing the issues with the product. When he arrived home after that was taken care of, it was already 10 PM.As soon as he walked inside the door, he saw this \u201cgecko\u201d daughter all up against the way outside of his study, hanging half way from the door and peeking at something inside with her head cocked.Had he not known that this was his birth daughter related to him by blood, he almost thought this girl was a thief.\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201dStartled by Gu Shao\u2019s voice coming from behind her, Gu Xi quickly bounced away from the door and turned toward Gu Shao.\u201cDa, uh, Dad. You are home.\u201dSeeing how thief-like Gu Xi was, Gu Shao raised his brows and asked, \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\u201cMmm, noth\u2026\u2026\u201d Gu Xi kept her head lowered. Her fingers twisted, she struggled for a long while before she finally told the truth. \u201cThat, I, I wish to look for some, em, reference books.\u201dGu Shao did not doubt Gu Xi\u2019s words. When he walked inside the door, he saw that Gu Xi\u2019s eyes were pretty much glued to the bookshelf.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go inside and look then?\u201d asked Gu Shao.Gu Xi looked fairly comical earlier.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Gu Xi didn\u2019t say anything.She felt that it was wrong to enter his study without Gu Shao\u2019s permission. It was already wrong of her trying to \u201csteal\u201d her essays in the past.Gu Shao could more or less guessed what was on Gu Xi\u2019s mind when she saw the look on her. His eyes dimmed a little and he sighed to himself. \u201cYou can always go in there by yourself if there\u2019s any books that you want to read or anything that you need.\u201dHaving said that, Gu Shao emphasized again, \u201cThis is your home.\u201d\u201cGo on in now.\u201d Gu Shao gestured for her to go inside seeing that she was still standing there, dazed.\u201cWhat is it that you want to read?\u201d asked Gu Shao.Gu Xi\u2019s eyes beamed. She pointed excitedly at a corner of the shelf, \u201cThose. The fundamental ones.\u201dGu Shao paused a little and frowned when he heard that. Reading other books could be a way to expand one\u2019s horizon and develop hobbies. Gu Shao did not object to these \u201cextracurricular reading\u201d but reading books on fundamentals\u2026\u2026 Was it her intention to further pursue this area?He would not interfere with Gu Xi\u2019s career choice but it was too early for a 14-year-old child to delve into professional knowledge.\u201cYou want to read these?\u201d asked Gu Shao.\u201cMmhmm.\u201d Gu Xi nodded. \u201cI just want to take a look at them.\u201d\u201cWhat is the basic configuration of a Ric-11 bipolar transistor?\u201d asked Gu Shao abruptly.\u201cCommon emitter, common base stage, and common collector,\u201d replied Gu Xi without missing a eat.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAll of a sudden, Gu Shao was the speechless one.His intention of asking the question was to tell Gu Xi in the most direct way that it was too soon for a junior high school student like her to be delving into professional knowledge and to stop overthinking.He did not expect Gu Xi to know the answer to his question.The atmosphere became awkward for a second there.Gu Shao was a bit troubled. He felt as though he had lifted up a rock only to drop it on his own foot.\u201cYour current responsibility is to focus on the knowledge in school. You shouldn\u2019t be wasting your time on things that you can\u2019t accomplish,\u201d said Gu Shao in a deep voice with a solemn look.Upon hearing that, Gu Xi\u2019s heart sank. She wanted to whine some more but, looking at the solemn look on Gu Shao, she nodded and said softly, \u201cOkay\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you done with your homework?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cGo work on it then.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d***As her plan to \u201cbump\u201d books had foiled, Gu Xi returned to her own room, crestafallen, and started on the remainder of her homework assignments.Someone knocked on her door after a little while.Gu Xi went to open up the door and saw that it was Gu Shao.\u201cDad.\u201d\u201cYou finished your homework?\u201d\u201cJust a little bit left.\u201d She added immediately, \u201cI am almost done.\u201dWithout saying anything else, Gu Shao handed two books over to Gu Xi.\u2013\u2013 They were the same two that she was eyeing on Gu Shao\u2019s bookshelf earlier.This was the first time Gu Shao had entered Gu Xi\u2019s room. Glancing inside of it from outside the door, with the exception of the pink colors that could pain one\u2019s eyes, everything else was neat and organized.Gu Shao noticed a few books on Gu Xi\u2019s shelf.Gu Xi probably brought those with her.What surprised Gu Shao was that 95% of these books looked familiar to him and over half of them were written by him.His eyes flickered a little. Looking down at the girl who was looking at him with anticipation in her eyes, the corners of his mouth relaxed some.\u201cYou can read them but don\u2019t let them distract you from your schoolwork.\u201d Lu Shao stressed seriously.But, if one was to listen carefully, one would be able to tell that his tone was nowhere as serious as it was before.\u201cThanks Dad!\u201dGu Xi wasn\u2019t sure whether it was her imagination that Gu Shao seemed to be in a somewhat good mood right now.Should she also come clean and let him know that she had just registered using his ID number while he was in a good mood?Before Gu Xi had made up her mind, Gu Shao said to her, \u201cI will be in the study. Bring your homework assignments for me to sign when you are done.\u201d He turned and left.\u201cOh, alright.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(4)On the other end, Xu Fei, who was swiping his friend's circle, saw another article shared by his boss.It was another public soft-skill article: The Importance of Parents Leading by Example.Xu Fei\u2019s finger who was clicking on \u201cLike\u201d quivered a little, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhy did he feel that his boss change of style was a bit abrupt?The key was that his boss even left a message under the soft-skill article. \u201cOnly when one is outstanding can they set a good example for their children.\u201dWhat was it that his boss was boasting about in between the lines?Was that the difference when one had a child? Was his boss going to start canvassing in his friend's circle in a few days\u2019 time?Xu Fei grumbled to himself but, little did he know, what he said this one day would come true someday.***Gu Xi was asked to go talk to the dean at his office the next day.Also summoned along with her were the other 7 individuals who would also be participating in the Joint Science Competition.The dean started talking about the competition when everyone had arrived.\u201cSome of you here had competed in the City B\u2019s High School Joint Science Competition in the past and some haven\u2019t. But I trust that all of you had heard about this competition. It wasn\u2019t a nationally standardized competition but it is still one that draw a lot of attention.\u201dAfter a slight pause, the dean looked over at all of them and carried on, \u201cSimilarly, this competition will also be a very meaningful experience for all of you. I urge you to treat it seriously and give it your best. Granted, the fact that you had been chosen to represent our school means that you are already the best students of your grade. I trust that you will be able to earn good scores and bring good outcome and glory for our school\u2026..\u201dThe dean was not even done with his official motivational speech when Gu Xi heard a soft \u201ctsk\u201d from next to her.It wasn\u2019t difficult to figure out who that was from.She turned her head and, sure enough, saw Sheng Xiuyan with his blank and this-is-giving-me-goosebump look.Surprisingly enough, the boy standing next to Sheng Xiuyan had the exact same look on him.Here she thought that Sheng Xiuyan would for sure be the only \u201cotherworldly\u201d person who didn\u2019t even bother to put up a front.Noticing the look on the two of them, the dean gave them a stare and said, \u201cYou two better be well-prepared. Stop with that lackadaisical attitude.\u201cIn addition, you are there to participate in the competition. Don\u2019t cause any troubles.\u201dThe second part was still aimed toward Sheng Xiuyan and the boy next to him.From the dean\u2019s understanding of the two boys. Each one of them was enough to bring about sufficient headache. He had no idea what sort of fresh h3ll they would bring when put together with each other.The two called out by the dean exchanged a look.\u201cYou heard him,\u201d said Sheng Xiuyan to Gu Chenyi, who was standing next to him, coldly.Gu Chenyi retorted, \u201cI think he was more talking to you. You should be the one to watch out for it.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. As for you, you got too much free time\u201d asked Sheng Xiuyan, referring to the fact of why Gu Chenyi was joining this competition this time. Was he there for the fun of it or to pull their legs?Hearing that, Gu Chenyi hrumphed unhappily. Then, recalling his own purpose, he felt complacent all over again. \u201cIt pleases me.\u201dThere was no way he would enter into such a stupid competition had Xixi not be a part of it.Lucky he was quick to act; otherwise, Gu Yanxiao would have robbed him of this opportunity.Gu Chenyi smiled proudly.The dean ignored the two \u201cproblematic valedictorians\u201d and looked away. He carried on to elaborate on the key items about the competition.\u201cAs the unified examination had been delayed, we will not have a lot of time to prepare for this competition. As such, the school will not be arranging for study sessions. Here are test questions from the past and predictive ones for this year. Pace yourself and study on your own.\u201dThe dean pointed at the stacks of books on the table next to her. These were the gift package prepared for them by the school before the competition.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - What happened? Why did Gu Shao sign up to the competition? (1)\u201cXi, ahem, Schoolmate Gu Xi?\u201dHearing her own name, Gu Xi was taken aback a little. She turned and noticed that the boy who was standing next to Sheng Xiuyan earlier was now standing next to her. He was smiling at her.For some inexplicable reasons, his look immediately reminded Gu Xi of a husky.Gu Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat a silly smile.Just a moment ago he was such a handsome boy and now\u2026\u2026 was he actually a fool?Gu Xi grumbled and, as though she was avoiding some strange person, subtly scooted away from him some.\u201cSomething\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Gu Xi. Her look clearly stated I-don\u2019t-know-you and who-the-heck-are-you?Gu Chenyi\u2019s smile stiffened a little when he saw that.He had almost forgotten that Xixi didn\u2019t know who they were yet.Giving his second uncle\u2019s personality, he probably never mentioned to Gu Xi the rest of the family.His grandpa had said that her days with her previous family were less than ideal and, worried that she might be traumatized by the idea of \u201cfamily members\u201d, the Gu family had been very cautious when it came to her.Even when Old Mr. Gu was dying to meet this granddaughter, he only dared to came and take a peek once. He dared not just abruptly show up in front of her.As such, Gu Chenyi dicided against telling Gu Xi that they were related at least until they were introduced under official capacity. He didn\u2019t want her startled or feel disturbed.\u2013 But that was okay. He could still take the opportunity and earn her fondness ahead of time.Gu Chenyi was very proud of his own idea.And then, he got another stare from the dean.\u201cWhat I am telling you now is very important. Listen carefully.\u201d Pausing a little, the dean carried on to say, \u201cI am not going to divide you up into teams right now. We will hold a 4-subject examination tomorrow and then the teacher will split you up into teams depending on the outcome.\u201cNow go back to your classes taking these examination questions with you.\u201dWhen the dean wad done talking, Gu Xi, too, went over to pick up her examination papers.Lo and behold, as soon as she reached out her hand, her gift pack was picked up by someone else.Gu Xi\u2019s lips twitched when she looked over at Gu Chenyi next to her and reminded him, \u201cClassmate, you took two sets.\u201d One of them belonged to her.\u201cI know.\u201d Gu Chenyi smiled at Gu Xi. \u201cThey are heavy. I\u2019ll carry them for you.\u201dGu Xi frowned a little. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d They were not light, but not heavy to a point that she wasn\u2019t able to carry them.Besides, she didn\u2019t think she and this \u201centhusiastic\u201d classmate had met yet.Before Gu Xi could object, Gu Chenyi had already picked up two gift packages and started walking toward Class #7.***The appearance of Gu Chenyi caused a little stir in Class #7.\u201cOh my gosh, Gu Chenyi?\u201d A girl exclaimed softly when she saw Gu Chenyi walking inside their classroom.\u201cIt is him. Why is he here?\u201d\u201cWait, is that Gu Xi behind him?\u201d Someone spotted Gu Xi behind him shortly and was surprised.\u201cSo, Gu Chenyi was\u2026 carrying the books for Gu Xi?\u201d\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d, \u201cDo they know each other?\u201d, \u201cWas Gu Chenyi the one who brought all the love bento before?\u201d, \u201cWhat is their relationship with each other?\u201d, \u201cCould it be that\u2026\u2026\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t care what their relationship is, I am envious.\u201d \u2026\u2026Everybody chimed in and the surprised looks remained on everyone even after Gu Chenyi had departed.Over on the other side, Wang Yankai and the others also looked over full of surprise at Sheng Xiuyan who returned almost at the same time. \u201cWhat happened, Brother Yan? How is it that you guys went to the teacher\u2019s office and Young Master Yi returned with you and\u2026\u2026\u201dAnd carrying the books for Gu Xi!Shouldn\u2019t that be Brother Yan\u2019s job?\u201cBrother Yan, that wasn\u2019t right. If you are not more proactive then Gu\u2026\u2026\u201d Before Liu Yangyang could finish with what he was saying, he was stopped by a look from Sheng Xiuyan.\u201cWhatever.\u201d What did that have to do with him.\u201cSilly.\u201d Sheng Xiuyan sneered. Then, looking in the direction that Gu Chenyi had walked away in, an odd look appeared on him.\u2013 Just what was up with that guy now?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - What happened? Why did Gu Shao sign up to the competition? (2)Right after Gu Xi had gotten rid of the classmates using \u201cclassmates should help each other out\u201d as an excuse, Dong Mingming, her deskmate, poked her head over and asked in a gossipy way, \u201cGu Xiao Xi, out with the truth. What is your relationship with Gu Chenyi.\u201d\u201cNo relation.\u201d She didn\u2019t even know him. Gu Xi didn\u2019t know what to make of that.\u201cI guess he\u2019s just a very friendly person and decided to help me carry the books back since we will be in the same competition and that I am a girl.\u201d That was the best reason that Gu Xi could think of.As soon as she was done talking, however, she got a \u201cyeah right\u201d look from Dong Mingming.\u201cI might believe that if it was someone else but not Gu Chenyi,\u201d grumbled Dong Mingming. Gu Chenyi was very much like Sheng Xiuyan at school. He may not appear to be as cold and distant as Sheng Xiuyan and appear more friendly but, deep down inside, they were the same.Gu Chenyi was the type who\u2019d pretend that he saw nothing and walk around a girl who fell in front of him.*Granted, the girl\u2019s classmate later on revealed that the girl fell purposefully.All in all, he wasn\u2019t one who was eager to lend a helping hand.Not to mention that he was smiling when he walked in with Gu Xi\u2019s books, and a happy smile at that?!That was too bizarre\u2026\u2026Dong Mingming grumbled to herself.After hearing what Dong Mingming had just said, Gu Xi stopped in the middle of tidying up her examination papers. \u201cWho did you say he is?\u201d\u201cWho are you asking about?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say his name is?\u201d Gu Xi turned and asked Dong Mingming.\u201cHe\u2019s Gu Chenyi.\u201d\u201cGu?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Dong Mingming nodded with a dubious look.Gu Xi\u2019s eyes moved a little. His surname was also Gu?Even though Gu wasn\u2019t some rare surname but, combining that fact with all of his \u201cbizarre\u201d behavior, Gu Xi suddenly recalled Gu Shao telling her that there were three boys over on the Gu family side and they were about the same age as her\u2026\u2026\u201cDo you really not know him?\u201d asked Dong Mingming again. Gu Xi looked genuinely baffled.Gu Xi smiled at her and said, \u201cI will in the future.\u201dGu Shao had also mentioned that those from her grandpa\u2019s side liked her. So her guess was: Gu Chenyi was a part of the Gu family.Came to think about it, he did look somewhat similar to Gu Shao.The smile on Gu Xi brightened some more.Dong Mingming was even more baffled after hearing what Gu Xi had said.Then, Gu Xi asked her, \u201cDo you know how his name is written?\u201dHe was one of the well-known students at school. Of course Dong Mingming knew how to write his name. But she also felt that Classmate Gu Xi\u2019s focus was very odd.Baffled, Dong Mingming wrote down Gu Chenyi\u2019s name on a piece of paper. \u201cLike this.\u201dGu Xi looked at the three characters on the piece of paper and committed his name to her memory.***At home that night.Gu Xi pulled over the gift package of examination questions given to her by the dean after she had completed her homework assignments.In the past, Liming would also arrange for similar practices and examinations before a competition.Gu Xi opened up a set of test questions and scanned over them. They were still the familiar content and familiar type of questions.Gu Xi had already done all of the past examinations before so she pulled out a set of predictive questions, all 20 pages of it.\u201cI wonder if I had fallen behind.\u201dGu Xi brought up a timer app on her cellphone as she mumbled to herself.Gu Xi started working on the set of questions as the timer started.Per the rules, the final round was for two contestants on each team to complete as many questions as they could in 60 minutes. Each correct answer would worth one point and each incorrect one would reduce the final score by 1.Quickly, her 60 minutes were up. Gu Xi had completed 11 problems and 2 of them were incorrect.She was not too happy with that outcome.\u201cYup, I had fallen behind.\u201d She grumbled.That particular outcome, however, would surprise any teacher at HSAU had they seen it. Both her speed and accuracy were impressive.___Translator\u2019s rambling:I think girls in China needs to work on better balances. Sure seem to read a lot of girls falling, intentional or otherwise.

    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - What happened? Why did Gu Shao sign up to the competition? (3)Gu Xi completed another set of examination questions before she put her draft papers away and logged into the webpage of Tianchuang Competition to check on the latest updates.Seeing that her status was now [approved], Gu Xi let out a sigh of relief.What she didn\u2019t know was that owing to her registration, the upper management of the competition had just adjourned a secret conference.\u2013 A few hours ago, the worker responsible for the reviewing of the contestant\u2019s information for Tianchuang Competition was startled by the registration information from \u201cGu Shao\u201d. He thought he read it wrong.He tripled checked the information and learned that all information of said contestant from his name, his personal information, to any other information were all identical to those of the boss with \u201cthe same name\u201d.The reviewer was stunned and escalated the matter up to his superior.Upon receiving the news, all the upper management of the competition were also stunned and dumbfounded.\u2013 What was going on? Gu Shao, Boss Gu, registered for the competition?Even though at this point in time Tianchuang Competition had only announced their business partners but not the official partners but NTN Technology Center was one of the hosts.To put it bluntly, the competition was there to service NTN. During the competition, the outstanding projects would receive investments from NTN. The winning project would further be acquired by NTN and have its own individual research and development laboratory.As far as they knew, Gu Shao was the one who proposed the Tianchuang Competition idea in the first place.The person who set the rules joined the competition in person?That made no sense no matter how they looked at it.\u201cCould it be that Boss Gu intend to test out the process\u2019s overall reasonability and stability?\u201d Someone speculated.\u201cSo are we approving him or not?\u201d\u201cOf course we are going to approve him. We have to if Boss Gu\u2019s intention is to monitor our evaluation process. Besides, Boss Gu used his own personal information. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that either,\u201d said one of them.The lead manager nodded as well. \u201cLet\u2019s approve him per our routine process. I will be heading over to NTN for a meeting two days from now. I will confirm with Boss Gu his intention to monitor then.\u201d***As such, Gu Xi was approved easily and in a convoluted way.Gu Xi browsed a little longer on the competition\u2019s official forum and read some professional discussions on there. They gave her new ideas and she wanted to discuss them with [AAA] and [Lin].Lo and behold, the noises outside her room, coming from the living room caught her attention. Surprised, she turned her computer and her lights off as fast as she could, dashed over to her bed and crawled under her blanket.The entire process was one fell swoop.Outside of her room, Gu Shao noticed the light coming through the crack under Gu Xi\u2019s room door darkened immediately. He frowned.\u2013 Why was she still up at this hour?Should he come up with some way to control her schedule? Especially when he was too busy to tend to it?Thought Gu Shao to himself.Hiding underneath her blanket inside her room, Gu Xi curled up under her blanket and listened attentively to the noises outside. Hearing that everything was normal, she finally let out a sigh of relief and patted herself on her chest.Lucky she was not caught.***At school the next day.After their second classes in the afternoon, the 8 who were picked to participate in the competition was arranged into a room for their testing.This classroom had been set up exactly like the format of the venue of the competition \u2013 each spot was separated by baffles so contestants could not distract each other.As the outcome of this testing would determine the teaming and timing of when they would compete during the course of the competition, everybody took this very seriously.With the exception of\u2026\u2026 Gu Chenyi.\u201cTesting? What testing?\u201d Gu Chenyi looked baffled.This boy spent all his time thinking about how to earn their Xixi\u2019s fondness the entire time the dean was explaining about the teaming and testing yesterday. He did not hear a word about this.Being summoned here, Gu Chenyi had nothing with him with the exception of the basketball that he brought with him straight from the basketball court.Gu Xi looked over at Gu Chenyi.Ever since she had figured out that Gu Chenyi was family, he seemed much more delicate-looking to her.And, with the \u201cfamily filter\u201d, she found him more cute than foolish.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - What happened? Why did Gu Shao sign up to the competition? (4)Nevertheless, it looked like he wasn\u2019t planning on revealing his identity to her just yet?\u201cHere, you can use this.\u201d Gu Xi handed him a pen.\u201c!\u201dGu Chenyi was dumbfounded when he saw the pen that Gu Xi was handing over to him: Xixi offered to lend him a pen! And her smile was so friendly!It had only been a day!It must have been his chivalry act yesterday that had earned her fondness.Gu Chenyi felt very emotionally secretively.Over on the other side, after Gu Xi had shoved the pen into Gu Chenyi\u2019s hand, she thought about it some and also gave him half of her scratch papers.\u201cOh right. Have half of my eraser too.\u201d As she spoke, she sliced her eraser into halves with her utility knife and handed half over to him.Looking at the stack of stationaries, no, care from his own family, Gu Chenyi was short of crying from his emotions: Xixi was too wonderful to him!If this was a dream, please keep going.\u201cGood luck,\u201d said Gu Xi to Gu Chenyi. She sat down at her own spot and got ready to begin.The dean and another proctoring teacher quickly distributed the test papers to every one of them.Once she had received the test papers, Gu Xi glanced over it from beginning to end.There was a total of 4 subjects \u2013 mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. All of them on the same set of paper. Each of them taking up one page.There were only 10 questions on each subject and all of them were multiple choices.The dean started talking, \u201cThis test is put together with questions from past competitions. They are on the same level of difficulty.\u201cThere\u2019s a total of 40 problems and you have an hour to complete them. Time yourself accordingly.\u201d40 problems in 60 minutes were not a big deal. Nevertheless, before everyone could feel happy about that, the dean told them the other request that was sufficient to make them unhappy. \u201cThey might be multiple choices, but you need to write out your steps.\u201d\u201cReally? We have to write out our steps of solving for the answers?\u201d That was like having to copy everything on their scratch paper onto the test paper.\u201cNo wonder there are all these blank spaces under every question.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too much hassle\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy not just give us problems instead?\u201dSomeone complained in a low voice.\u201cQuiet.\u201d The dean glared over at the few who talked and carried on. \u201cThey are multiple choices because that\u2019s what you will see in the competition. As for asking you to write down your process, that\u2019s for the teachers to better evaluate your condition and level.\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough chitchatting. Let\u2019s get started.\u201dThe dean drummed on the desk and announced that the timing has begun. The few in front of her finally stopped talked and started working on their examinations quietly.Gu Xi, too, stopped thinking about this and that and started focusing on her problems.The first question of a geometry one. After underlining the important data, Gu Xi started scribbling.She had just written down the first word when she stopped herself.The teacher only asked for them to write down their process. They didn\u2019t ask for anything specific.Besides, these were multiple choice. Theoretically there was only one way to grade. They were either right or wrong. There were no partial credits for the process.She thought about it some and finally decided against the step-by-step process that one would use to solve for a problem. Instead, she drew a diagram on the test paper and marked all of the data and their relationships on there one by one. She was able to quickly deduct the answer to the question.The next one was a calculation one and judging from what were given, the answer should be a 7-digit number. As such, the answer would be either A or C.Gu Xi used the last digit of each of the numbers for her calculation and figured out that the last number should be a 7. The answer was, therefore, C.Moving on to question #3\u2026\u2026She had done too many similar ones to know that B was the right answer at first glance.Nevertheless, she hesitated for 2 seconds and finally scribbled down some simple thought process.Once she had gotten used to the style of answering, Gu Xi was able to pick up on her speed.It was very quiet in the examination room. The only noises that could be heard was that of the tips of pencils running across papers.It took Gu Xi 30 minutes to get through all of the questions. She habitually reviewed the questions one more time before she stopped.Gu Xi looked up. The others should still be working on theirs.Sheng Xiuyan and Gu Chenyi had already turned in their papers without her knowing and were relaxing in the back of the classroom. One of them was spinning the basketball and the other one sleeping.Gu Xi turned away and decided to go over her paper one more time \u2013 she adamantly refused to \u201cstoop to their level\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - Gu Xi heard the name \"Liming\" but she didn't pay it too much attention. (1)When 60-minute time was up, the teachers collected everyone\u2019s test papers.The four teachers graded and swapped the papers on the spot and they quickly graded all 8 sets of them.The dean looked over everyone\u2019s test papers carefully, had a discussion with the other teachers and finally arrived at a decision on how to split up the teams.\u201cLet me announce the dividing up of teams.\u201d The dean wrote them down on the blackboard as he talked.\u201cEvent 1, mathematics, Gu Xi, Sheng Xiuyan, Wang Zhouwei.\u201cEvent 2, chemistry, \u2026\u2026\u201dEach group consisted of three members.Surprisingly, Gu Xi, Sheng Xiuyan, and Gu Chenyi would each compete twice.Of the remaining people, with the exception of the top of junior class, all the other individual would only be competing in one event.Yan Jie was at least top of the junior class. That made sense.Gu Xi and the others were only sophomores, why would the teachers pick the three of them to do the heavy lifting?The others were baffled.The others peeked their heads over at Gu Xi and the others test papers curiously \u2013 they just wanted to know their differences.When they saw them, they were dumbfounded.\u201cEm\u2026\u2026.\u201d Wasn\u2019t Gu Xi\u2019s test papers a bit on the simple side?\u2013 What took them 7-8 steps to solve, it took her only 3 lines!It seemed she had skipped a lot.At least Gu Xi\u2019s one had something written on them. Gu Chenyi and Sheng Xiuyan\u2019s ones were even worse!Gu Chenyi, too, drew a diagram much like Gu Xi\u2019s for the first problem. Then he wrote on there \u2013 \u201cIt looked to be about 30 or so degrees from the diagram. As such, the answer is C.\u201dSheng Xiuyan\u2019s one was even worse. First problem: Inkling.He might as well have said if there were 3 long and 1 short one, then pick the short one; if there were 3 short and 1 long ones, then pick the long one. If they were all different length then pick C!***\u201cTeacher, what kind of standard was that?\u201d Someone couldn't help but asked.They were picked to compete in the mathematic segments with these kinds of answers? This must be a joke.Looking at the few with the dissatisfied look, the dean said nonchalantly, \u201cThis is multiple choice, not problems. We asked you to list out your steps not to so that we can grade your steps but to follow your thought process.\u201dThat was the biggest difference between an examination and a competition.The dean paused a little and went on, \u201cDuring a competition, the key isn\u2019t the how you solved the problem. Rather, the person who could best determine the accurate answers with the fastest speed would be able to score the highest.\u201dEspecially in the final time-limit part. Speed and accuracy were the key.Having said that, the dean looked over at Gu Xi and the other two. He hesitated for a little while before she finally decided on Gu Xi and Sheng Xiuyan for the final time-limit round.She knew Sheng Xiuyan\u2019s ability very well and so she was not at all worried.As for Gu Xi, not only was she not worried, she was anticipating it, in fact. She looked at the test papers for the final round during last year\u2019s competition. Gu Xi scored the highest among all contestants.Had the other stupid not made so much mistakes that the total score was lowered, the victory would have gone to Liming instead of HSAU.As for the reason that she did not pick Gu Chenyi \u2013 it was his first time participating in a competition of this sort. She worried that he would have stage fright, this being his first time.\u201cAlright, so that\u2019s that. Now focus on preparing for your segments. We will make adjustments accordingly should the need arise,\u201d said the dean.She went on to give them more information about the competition. \u201cThis is the first time for some of you so I will remind you here. The competition will start on a Friday and go over the weekend. That will be three days total. The school will arrange for transportation and room and board. Don\u2019t forget to let your parents know\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Gu Xi heard the name \"Liming\" but she didn't pay it too much attention. (2)After she returned home that night, Gu Xi told Gu Shao about the joint competition.\u201c\u2026\u2026, as such, I will be gone for three days.\u201dHaving heard that, Gu Shao nodded and said, \u201cAlright.\u201dGu Shao had already learned about Gu Xi being in the competition \u2013 Director Zhou from school had already given him a call that afternoon, when he was in a meeting, and informed him of it.Gu Xi was dazed. She looked at Gu Shao: Was that it? There was nothing else that he wanted to say?Over on this side, Gu Shao looked up from a document and saw that Gu Xi was still standing there, her head lowered, looking troubled. It seemed there was even a hint of disappointment in her eyes?\u201cWatch out for your own safety when you are out and listen to your teachers. Don\u2019t go off on your own. Tell the teachers or call home if you run into any problems,\u201d added Gu Shao.Gu Xi finally had a smile on her when she heard that from Gu Shao. She reassured him, \u201cOkay. I will. Don\u2019t worry, Dad.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u2026\u201d Gu Xi started again.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Gu Shao as he saw the troubled look on Gu Xi.\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d Gu Xi shook her head. She had wanted to tell him that parents could attend the final award ceremony portion. That being said, she recalled that Xu Fei had mentioned that Gu Shao was quite busy recently. After some more thought, she decided against it.\u201cGoodnight, Dad.\u201d Gu Xi turned and left after she said that.Watching Gu Xi bounced out of his study, Gu Shao lifted his brows and his looked mellowed out.***Thursday afternoon came quickly.The 8 who would be participating in the competition packed up first at home, then meet up to leave from school together with their teachers.Before Gu Xi took off, Aunty Mei gave her a long exhortation, worried.\u201cDo remember to call home if you run into any problems, okay? You can call home or call up Mr. Gu. Grandma Mei had packed you medicines for cold, fever, and motion sickness. You will see them in your luggage. Don\u2019t forget to take the medicines if you are not feeling well. Read the instructions before you take them. If you are not certain, ask your teachers\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Xi nodded to whatever Aunty Mei was telling her. And she wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it all: She was only going to be gone for three days and to City B that was only the next district over. Why did Aunty Mei make it sound like she was going somewhere far away and for a long time?Gu Xi looked at the two suitcases to one said and her lips twitched.She was only going to be gone for three days and had only packed herself one suitcase. Lo and behold, she had just turned around and Aunty Mei made it two suitcases for her.\u201cOh, yes, I almost forgot.\u201d Having said that, Aunty Mei went inside the kitchen and handed a bag to Gu Xi when she returned. \u201cI made these snacks this morning. Bring them with you to snack on your way, Xiao Xi.\u201dGu Xi nodded and, after taking the bag over and taking a look, noticed that there were two portions inside of it.Aunty Mei explained to her, \u201cI packed two portions. One is for you, the other one is for you to share with your other schoolmates.\u201dJust two portions. The extra portion was probably not going to be enough for the other schoolmates.Gu Xi grumbled to herself.Obviously, by \u201cother classmates\u201d, Aunty Mei was referred to Gu Chenyi.Gu Xi stopped herself from pointing that out and nodded.\u201cAnd take these with you too. They are all snacks. If you don\u2019t have enough to eat, you can always snack on them. Don\u2019t let yourself go hungry.\u201dWatching as Aunty Mei pulled out another big package of food, Gu Xi started feeling uncomfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t need that much. It will take up too much room.\u201dAunty Mei didn\u2019t think that would be a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. If you can\u2019t carry them all you can have your schoolmate help you.\u201dGu Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Needless to say, said schoolmate\u2019s surname was Gu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - Gu Xi heard the name \"Liming\" but she didn't pay it too much attention. (3)Gu Xi left her house and went back to school.Her car pulled over closed to the meeting spot and, as soon as Gu Xi got out of the car and before she could even stand still, Gu Chenyi popped out of nowhere.\u201cOh hey, what a coincidence.\u201d Walking in front of Gu Xi, he gave her the I-just-happened-to-walk-past-and-saw-youlook.Gu Xi: Hoho, alright. I\u2019ll just play along and not call you out on it.\u201cIt is surely a coincidence,\u201d said Gu Xi as she raised the corners of her lips expressionlessly.On the other end, the chauffeur had already pulled Gu Xi\u2019s luggage out from the trunk and, before Gu Xi could walk over there, Gu Chenyi had already beaten her to it and stretched his arm out at the chauffeur.\u201cHere, give them to me.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201d Gu Xi wanted to say he didn\u2019t need to do that.The chauffeur had already handed Gu Xi\u2019s luggage over to Gu Chenyi with no hesitation.\u201cThey are a little heavy.\u201d Gu Xi reminded him. She had no idea what Aunty Mei put in them afterward.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d said Gu Chenyi, not bothered by it.***Under the others\u2019 surprised looks, Gu Chenyi brought Gu Xi\u2019s luggage onto the bus and put the aside for her.\u201cEm\u2026\u2026\u201d Yang Mengmeng walked over to them.There were only two girls among the 8 members who would be participating in the competition \u2013 Gu Xi, then there was Yang Mengmeng.Yang Mengmeng came over with the intention to sitting with Gu Xi.As it turned out, before she could even say anything, the spot next to Gu Xi was already taken up by Gu Chenyi.Having no other options, Yang Mengmeng could only turned around and sit with a freshman.Over on this side, after Gu Chenyi had set aside both of their luggage, he said down next to Gu Xi with a \u201cpraise me\u201d look. Gu Xi put on a smile, patted him on his shoulder and said to him, \u201cGood job.\u201d\u201cOh yeah, why don\u2019t you bring down the pink bag from above?\u201d said Gu Xi. That was the snacks that Aunty Mei had prepared for the two of them.\u201cThis one?\u201d\u201cMmhmm.\u201d Gu Xi took the bag from him and handed him a box of snacks. \u201cThis is yours.\u201dGu Chenyi\u2019s eyes widened and he looked at the box of snacks incredulously. \u201cFor me?\u201dHappiness hit him so hard and fast that he didn\u2019t know how to react to it.\u201cOh, you don\u2019t want it?\u201d asked Gu Xi intentionally as she lifted her brows.\u201cI want it!\u201d This was from Xixi, the first in the Gu family!Besides, judging from the familiar look and smell, this was definitely made by Aunty Mei.With a bite of egg yolk puffed pastry in his mouth, tears almost rolled down Gu Chenyi\u2019s cheeks. Ever since Aunty Mei was taken away by Second Uncle, the quality of meals at home had been getting worse and worse.After Gu Chenyi had finished a piece of puffed pastry when Gu Xi handed over a bottle of water to him.Gu Chenyi, \u201c!\u201d Where was his cellphone? He must send a message to brag to Gu Yanxiao!***Sheng Xiuyan, sitting across from them took a look at the two of them and had a dubious look on him: Since when did these two become so close with each other?No, since when did the brain-dead Gu Chenyi become such a people person?Did the two know each other from before? Both of their surnames are Gu\u2026\u2026A possibility occurred to Sheng Xiuyan but he quickly struck that down. As far as he knew, with the distantly-related Gu XueEr, there wasn\u2019t one by the name of Gu Xi.Sheng Xiuyan looked back away, decided not to concern himself with that, switched to a different position and went back to sleep.***Over on this side, when Gu Xi looked to have fallen asleep, Gu Chenyi quickly fished out his cellphone, sneakily took a picture of the two of them together, and posted it to their chat group gloatingly along with the texts: [I am heading to the competition with Xixi. No need to worry for us.]Over at the Gu\u2019s, Gu Yanxiao, who had just seen the message gritted his teeth in annoyance \u2013 He had wanted to submit his application as well but Gu Chenyi beat him to it.His annoyance, however, was short-lived. He looked at the time and waited for two minutes before he sent a private message to Gu Chenyi: [You\u2019ve sent it to the wrong group.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - Gu Xi heard the name \"Liming\" but she didn't pay it too much attention. (4)\u201cWhat?\u201d Gu Chenyi was taken aback a little after he saw the message from Gu Yanxiao before he figured out what he was saying.\u201cOh shoot! It\u2019s all over!\u201d He had shared in the wrong chat group!He meant to send to the [One Happy Family], the one without his Second Uncle, but his hand slipped and clicked on [Big Happy Family], the one with Gu Shao.In addition, there were also [Making the Family Happy] and [Big Happy Clan], which excluded his Big Uncle and his father, respectively. Old Mr. Gu was the one who named all of them.Gu Chenyi couldn\u2019t figure out why his grandfather must make the names so similar! Was he not worried that he would share to the wrong group when he badmouthed a certain son of his?!Now that two minutes had passed, it was too late to recall his message.As such, Gu Chenyi received his first ever private message from his Second Uncle.[Stay out of trouble, the two of you.]It was a very simple sentence but Gu Chenyi could feel the threat from the other end of the phone.[Yes, Second Uncle. I will keep an eye out on Xixi.][Gu Shao: I am talking about you.][Oh me? I am fine\u2026\u2026] Gu Chenyi replied with a guilty conscience.Gu Shao did not say anything else but sent Gu Chenyi some money.Looking at the money that just showed up out of nowhere, Gu Chenyi was stunned: This was the first time he received spending money from his Second Uncle other than from red envelopes over New Year time!Wait, no, this is the budget for taking care of Xixi.***The car arrived at their destination quickly.The responsible teacher said to them, \u201cWe will be staying at the Maple Leave Hotel.\u201dIn order to maintain the fairness of the competition and also have earn some exposures, the annual competition normally took place in the comprehensive teaching experimental area in the urban part of City B. Each school would be responsible for arranging for their own room and board.For as long as Gu Xi could remember, Maple Leave Hotel was one of the hotels slower to the competition venue.\u201cOur school was able to book Maple Leave Hotel this time? That\u2019s impressive,\u201d said a junior from the row behind Gu Xi.The person sitting next to him said, \u201cThey are all about the same, if you ask me.\u201d\u201cI heard that No. 3 and No. 6 High School along with Liming will all be staying here.\u201d\u2026\u2026Gu Xi paused a little when she heard the familiar name \u201cLiming\u201d but she didn\u2019t dwell too much on it.It was only normal for a few schools to be staying at the same hotel.With the exception of the final award ceremony, the different schools did not mingle with each other. Most of the time they would be readying themselves individually.After they were done with registration, the piece of gum by the name of Gu Chenyi finally couldn\u2019t stick around Gu Xi anymore and Yang Mengmeng finally got her chance of getting close to Gu Xi.As there were only two girls participating in this competition, Gu Xi and Yang Mengmeng shared the same room.After some chitchatting, the two became more familiar with each other.After they had divvied up the bed and organized their luggage, Yang Mengmeng finally couldn't help but asked curiously, \u201cSchool Sister Gu Xi, what is the relationship between you and Gu Chenyi?\u201dYang Mengmeng was being subtle but, given the gossipy look on her, her meaning was quite obvious.Unfortunately, Gu Xi was focused on taking care of the very weighty \u201ccare\u201d from Aunty Mei and missed the wink from Yang Mengmeng.\u201cHuh? What?\u201d Gu Xi looked up and gave Yang Mengmeng a baffled look.Yang Mengmeng thought Gu Xi didn\u2019t get what she meant so she repeated, \u201cI mean, you two look close.\u201dUpon hearing that, Gu Xi paused a little. She then smiled and nodded. \u201cYes, we are quite close.\u201dThe family filter made her quite fond of Gu Chenyi.Yang Mengmeng\u2019s eyes lit up after she heard Gu Xi\u2019s words. She followed up excitedly, \u201cKekeke, so you two are dating?\u201dWhy else would Gu Chenyi be so nice to her if they weren\u2019t a couple.\u201cPuuf cough cough\u2026\u2026\u201d Gu Xi also spit her water out after she heard Yang Mengmeng. What was she talking about? Girl, you have some active imagination there.Gu Xi gave Yang Mengmeng a helpless look, smiled, and clarified, \u201cWe are close because we are family.\u201dYang Mengmeng was enlightened by that. \u201cOooh, I see\u2026\u2026\u201dYang Mengmeng gave Gu Xi an awkward smile. \u201cI almost misunderstood.\u201d But what was that slight disappointment that she was feeling just now?\u201cSo you are cousins [on the mother\u2019s side]?\u201d asked Yang Mengmeng again curiously.Gu Xi thought about it some, \u201cI think on the father side\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, right!\u201d That reminded Yang Mengmeng. If both their surnames were \u201cGu\u201d, naturally that should be the father side.\u201cSo he\u2019s your older cousin then. Kekeke,\u201d said Yang Mengmeng.Gu Xi didn\u2019t respond. Something had just occurred to her. She did know for sure that Gu Chenyi was the older one of the two.Gu Shao only mentioned that they were about the same age. He didn\u2019t specifically say which one of them was older.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Lin Anxin wanted to expose Gu Xi's infamous past in front of her new schoolmates. (1)That night, after Gu Xi had settled in and was just about to start studying, a message popped up on her phone.It was from Gu Chenyi with just four words: [Come to your door.] He even added a you-know-whatemoji at the end of it.Gu Xi was baffled but she still walked over to the door with her cellphone on hand.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Gu Xi with her brows raised as she looked at Gu Chenyi who looked like he had just returned from the outside.\u201cTake you to good food.\u201d Gu Chenyi dragged Gu Xi downstairs with him when he was done talking.Gu Chenyi retrieved bags of snacks that he had stored at the front desk and handed them all over to Gu Xi.\u201cI heard that this shop was all the raved so I went,\u201d said Gu Chenyi. This shop was all the rave and he had to stand in line for almost an hour.Gu Xi looked down at them. There were roasted cheese, roasted marsh mellows, milk tea, all sorts of sweets. All in all, everything that one could think of.\u201cThis much?\u201d\u201cI worry that you didn\u2019t have enough to eat at night.\u201dGu Chenyi noticed that Gu Xi didn\u2019t seem to have eaten a lot over dinner. Worried that she\u2019d be hungry, he went to the raved shop and bought one of every one of their items.\u2013 As his Second Uncle had provided him with budgets, he couldn\u2019t possibly let Xixi go hungry.Luckily Gu Xi couldn\u2019t read Gu Chenyi\u2019s mind. She would otherwise have asked him: Boy, you don\u2019t have a very good idea of a girl\u2019s appetite.Gu Xi ate quite a bit over dinner.Regardless, the food that Gu Chenyi had bought looked quite delectable. She could smell the sweet milky aroma even through the paper bag.***In a corner of the hotel, two silhouettes squatted behind a couch and ate stealthily.Looking at Gu Xi, who said she wasn\u2019t hungry just a second ago, devouring the food, Gu Chenyi patted her on her should suddenly.\u201cTake advantage of your two free days to enjoy the yummy food,\u201d said Gu Chenyi.Gu Xi gave him a speechless look. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think. Second, um, I mean your parents must not let you eat these at home.\u201dWith his understanding of his second uncle, most definitely not. About 90% of yummy food were but junk food in the eyes of his second uncle. He had well experienced that at the dinner table at the Gu\u2019s.\u2013 Aren\u2019t you worried that my parents will want to have a talk with you?Gu Xi gave Gu Chenyi a silent look.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will make arrangements for you for the next couple of days.\u201d Gu Chenyi had already started planning what tasty food to bring Gu Xi the next day.\u201cThis one is yummy!\u201d Having said that, Gu Chenyi handed over the cheese stick that he had taken a bite out of over to Gu Xi. \u201cHere, try this.\u201dGu Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing that Gu Xi didn\u2019t react to that, Gu Chenyi thought she didn\u2019t believe him and said again, \u201cReally. I am not kidding you. This marsh mellow with liquid filling was amaze.\u201cTry it for yourself. You can give it back to me if you don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t mind.\u201dThe corners of Gu Xi\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d But I do.\u201cYou enjoy it.\u201d Gu Xi paused for a little, then said, \u201cI\u2019m already full.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally.\u201d\u201cThen give me the rest.\u201dGu Chenyi took the remaining food and woofed them all down.Looking at the boy who looked like he could go \u201canother round\u201d, Gu Xi couldn't help but thought to herself: Are you sure it wasn\u2019t you who wanted to snack and just dragged me here with you?***The two get ready to go back when they were done eating.They were just about to walk inside of an elevator when they saw two girls walking out, holding hands.\u201cI heard there\u2019s a very good fried skewer in cold pot place nearby that was quite the rave.\u201d\u201cDo you think they are still open?\u201d\u201cI checked their time. They should still be open and it is just a few hundred meters from here\u2026\u2026\u201dAs the two talked about the small shop, they stopped abruptly the second they saw Gu Xi. Their eyes widened and they looked incredulous.Apparently, the two of them recognized Gu Xi.Gu Xi didn\u2019t know them but she recognized Liming\u2019s emblem on their clothes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His face dropped a little the way he was looking at the two girls.\u201cDo you know those two from before?\u201d He seemed to be asking her casually but his look was not all that casual.He heard that owing to the fools of the Lin family and her instant sister, Xixi had been ostracized and bullied at her previous school. If those two had participated in hurting Gu Xi, he just might not be able to keep to his promise to his Second Uncle and stay out of trouble.Gu Xi shook her head, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know them.\u201dGu Xi was reading the information sent by her teacher regarding the competition the next day and was not looking at Gu Chenyi. As such, she did not notice the very different cold and solemn look on him. He looked nothing like the silly husky that she always thought of him. In fact, he looked somewhat like the solemn Gu Shao.\u201cThe teacher said in the group chat that the competition will be completely paperless and there will not be pen and paper provided. Remember to bring your own scratch paper and pen.\u201d Gu Xi turned and reminded Gu Chenyi.Gu Chenyi had wiped away his solemn look and said relaxingly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d How could he possibly forget to bring pen and paper?That being said, he was still happy that Gu Xi cared about him.Gu Xi raised her brows and gave Gu Chenyi a quiet look.She recalled the practice examination that they had took at school for the purpose of splitting into teams\u2026\u2026 this young man here did not appear to be very reliable. Gu Xi decided to bring two sets of pens and papers tomorrow. That way she would have enough to share with him if he forgot.\u201cBut, seriously, you really never had conflicts with those two we just ran into?\u201d Gu Chenyi asked again, still worried.\u201cNone really.\u201d Gu Xi shrugged and said, \u201cWe just attended the same school was all.\u201dEver since the rumors had started, Gu Xi hadn\u2019t interacted with very many people and those two were not here last year when she was here for the competition.***Gu Xi thought running into Liming\u2019s student was just an insignificant incident.Lo and behold, she ran into them again the next morning when she was having breakfast.Specifically, she was ran into.***\u201cEh, there\u2019s a restaurant over there as well?\u201d\u201cI think those are for other schools.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Let\u2019s go take a look.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? There are no rules that say each school can only dine in a specific area. We can eat over there as well. Nobody said that area was designated for another school.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201dA few voices came closer from afar.One of the voices was only too familiar to Gu Xi \u2013 of course it belonged to Lin Anxin.Gu Xi was surprised.Not that she was running into Lin Anxin here; she was surprised that with Lin Anxin was able to be picked to represent Liming in this competition given her grades in school.Even though Lin Anxin\u2019s had always aimed to crush Gu Xi in all area, including academically. Truth was, Lin Anxin\u2019s grades had always only been just a tad above average.It didn\u2019t make sense even if she was just here to cruise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - Lin Anxin wanted to expose Gu Xi's infamous past in front of her new schoolmates. (3)Lin Anxin\u2019s delicate voice came from not too far away. \u201cEating at a different spot is a nice change of scenery. Besides, doesn\u2019t that window up front looks like it will give a better view? And we can see when our bus arrives as well.\u201dThe others didn\u2019t really agree with her. All of the others had the competition in mind right now and just couldn\u2019t care less about where to sit to have breakfast and how good the view was.At this very moment, however, a male\u2019s voice rang, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go over there then.\u201dWith the boy\u2019s buy in, the others no longer object to it.And that was how the \u201crun in\u201d happened.\u201cEh? Isn\u2019t that Lin Xi from our school before?\u201d shouted Lin Anxin as she pointed in Gu Xi\u2019s direction.Lin Anxin\u2019s voice successfully had those from Liming looking over at Gu Xi and also successfully had those from HSAU looked over at them.The two schools had never ceased to compete with each other on examinations and competitions.This very moment, when the competitors ran into each other, the atmosphere was peculiar.Lin Anxin seemed to be the only one who didn\u2019t feel awkward.\u201cI didn\u2019t have the wrong person, did I?\u201d She continued to act surprised and asked the person next to her.Gu Xi had no idea how the Lin family settled the issue with Lin Anxin having conflict with someone else and ended up being pushed into the pond. It was apparently that Lin Anxin had regained her status as a popular girl.Gu Xi, however, found her poor acting embarrassing.Gu Xi couldn\u2019t think of any reason other than Lin Anxin making a scene intentionally in order to get attention from both sides.And, she was right. Lin Anxin was doing it on purpose. When Lin Anxin heard from the other two students that they had run into Gu Xi yesterday, she was surprised but she was also obsessed with wanting to revenge Gu Xi and to exposed Gu Xi\u2019s infamous past in front of her new schoolmates.Lin Anxin found out that those from HSAU was dining over here. That was the reason she directed those from her school over this way.\u201cThat is her.\u201dLin Anxin waited till someone agreed with her before she started walking toward Gu Xi.\u201cSenior Lin Xi, long time no see.\u201cI thought you are overseas. So you transferred to a different school?\u201d Having said that, Lin Anxin covered her mouth in surprise, \u201cWas it because of the ru\u2026.\u201dLin Anxin was cut off by Gu Chenyi before she could finish what she was saying.\u201cWhere did this brain dead come from? Can you not yak around here?\u201d Gu Chenyi\u2019s voice was lazy but the look in his eyes was intimidating.Lin Anxin stiffened a little. She was taken aback for a few seconds when she looked over at Gu Chenyi. Blushing a little, she quickly put on a delicate, pitiful, and fragile look. \u201cI only wanted to see if I have the right person when I saw my senior who attended my school in the past.\u201dHer look, however, only gave Gu Chenyi the creep.\u201cOh yeah? Then you\u201d have the wrong person.Gu Chenyi wasn\u2019t done talking when Gu Xi tucked at his arm.Gu Xi looked away from her plate, looked up, and gave Lin Anxin a fake smile. \u201cYou have the right person.\u201dUnder the curious look from around her, Gu Xi went on, \u201cBut my name is not Lin Xi. It\u2019s Gu Xi.\u201dNow it was Lin Anxin\u2019s turn to be speechless. Her intention was use that as a lead in to bring out Gu Xi\u2019s past scandals of plagiarism, cheating, and other inappropriate behaviors. Albeit the fact that she made up most of those but as long as she blurted them out now and with the other students from Liming as the \u201cwitnesses\u201d, at least some of Gu Xi\u2019s schoolmates from HSAU would buy them.She had expected that Gu Xi would just admit to it so openly.\u201cBut, but why? Did you change your name because\u201d of the scandals?Gu Xi cut her off before Lin Anxin could finish her sentence.\u201cMy surname is Gu because that my father\u2019s surname. As for why my surname was Lin in the past. Welp, that is a long story.\u201d Gu Xi blinked, then changed the direction of the conversation. \u201cI can, however, summarize the story. We will have to start with the clich\u00e9 stories that transpired between Madam Song and Mr. back many years ago\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Lin Anxin wanted to expose Gu Xi's infamous past in front of her new schoolmates. (4)Gu Xi\u2019s words made Lin Anxin turn pale bit by bit. And her look went from its original aggressiveness to fear.She hadn\u2019t expected that Gu Xi would share what had happened between her mother and father. How dare she! Was she not worried that others would look down upon her if she shared those details?Looking at how calm Gu Xi was, Lin Anxin was intimidated. She couldn\u2019t let Gu Xi share those stories, or how they were related with each other. That would otherwise bring problems for her.Backed into a corner, Lin Anxin grabbed a cup in front of her and threw it onto the floor.KADONG!The loud noises startled everyone there.Some of the boys who were behind Lin Anxin walked over to her and asked caringly, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cOh, nothing. I accidentally knocked over their cup,\u201d explained Lin Anxin. Then, looking over at Gu Xi, she said, \u201cI thought you changed your name because of what happened at your previous school. If it was personal reasons, then you don\u2019t need to share.\u201dGao Zifan, who was standing next to Lin Anxin, nodded. When he looked over at Gu Xi and met her eyes, however, an unconcealed resentment appeared on him.Gu Xi, too, was looking at him. She only felt that there were 10,000 alpacas running through her head.Gao Zifan, the number 1 junior at Liming High School.But that was not the reason why Gu Xi remembered him. It was because of the novel.In the extra of the novel, \u201cLin Xi\u201d, Lin Anxin, and Gao Zifan all got into the same senior high school. Gao Zifan was the male god of the school and \u201cLin Xin\u201d always had a thing for him. Nevertheless, Gao Zifan didn\u2019t care about \u201cLin Xi\u201d and became Lin Anxin\u2019s boyfriend. That triggered \u201cLin Xi\u201d to become a villainess. She became more jealous of her sister and started targeting Lin Anxin in all and every way\u2026\u2026That story arc gave Lin Xi the creeps and nothing else.She had a thing for Gao Zifan? Was that a joke?Gao Zifan\u2019s grades weren\u2019t as good as her; probably even worse than that Sheng Xiuyan\u2019s.As for his looks\u2026\u2026Gu Xi looked over at Gu Chenyi next to her \u2013 that Gao Zifan was leaps and bounders from her Xiao Yi-zi, alright?As such, even if Gu Xi\u2019s IQ was slashed by \u00be and she had gone blind plus amnesia, there was still no way she would fall for that Gao Zifan.That being said, back when she was still at Liming and when her scandals were at their worse, one of the many of them was that she had a thing for Gao Zifan. And that she would do anything to be the top student just for the sake of getting his attention as was the reason she participated in all of the competitions.Gu Xi: Hoho.***Even though Gu Xi found Gao Zifan repulsive, he still blocked in front of Lin Anxin in a very protective manner and said coldly to Gu Xi, \u201cAll Anxin did is walked over and said hi to someone familiar. Was that necessary?\u201dWas that necessary? Was what necessary?Gu Xi looked at the two standing in front of her like she was looking at two lunatics \u2013 Lin Anxin looked very aggrieved and Gao Zifan looked like he wanted justice for her.Gu Xi looked away wordlessly while she tucked at Gu Chenyi, who almost busted out laughing by how ridiculous those two were.Conjuring up non-existing details was a form of illness. They wondered whether that was infectious.Lin Anxin was unhappy secretly that Gu Xi had remained silent. She didn\u2019t let her feelings show but maintained her innocent look.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I only came to say hi out of curiosity was all.\u201cThat being said, what is senior doing here?\u201d Lin Anxin purposefully stressed the word \u201csenior\u201d as though she wanted to emphasize to the others that the only relationship between herself and Gu Xi was that they both studied at the same school once.Having said that, Lin Anxin put on a surprised look. \u201cYou are not here as a representative for HSAU for the Joint Science Competition, are you?\u201cThat\u2019s quite interesting. Senior represented Liming last year but is representing HSAU this year?\u201d\u2013 Was Lin Anxin trying to draw aggro for her?___Translator's rambling:Don't know about y'all, but I find this satisfying... or at least the beginning of satisfying.My personal fav - \"As such, even if Gu Xi\u2019s IQ was slashed by \u00be and she had gone blind plus amnesia, there was still no way she would fall for that Gao Zifan.\" =D =DPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
