Somehow his memories were not erased. All the memories of his life piled up inside him.He built a library of life.Some lives were too long and huge, so he put them in the corner of the library, and some were so precious that he placed them in a place where he could easily see.After his first life, he didn\u2019t reincarnate as a human being again.Actually, he didn\u2019t want to be born as a human, so he was okay with it. But he has been reborn as other creatures over and over again and never been reborn as a human. This feat was actually amazing.Every time he reincarnated, he seemed to have gradually forgotten that he was a human being in the beginning.* * *\u201cBu Bu Bu.\u201d The baby laughed.Lee Min-Joon and Seo Eun-Hye, a couple who just married, felt a warm sensation deep down their chests.\u201cMy baby is so cute\u2026\u2026.\u201dLee Min-Joon also nodded at Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s praise.The seven-month-old couple\u2019s baby was so gentle that it was truly a blessing.He eats well, behaves well, and doesn\u2019t get sick anywhere. The other couples with babies greatly envied Lee Min-Joon and Seo Eun-Hye for having such a baby.\u201cSeojun! Lee Seojun!\u201d\u201cDaddy, Daddy!\u201d Argh! The baby laughed. Even though he was still a baby, his round eyes twinkled, and his features were clear.His smiling face was like the spring sun. He was an adorable baby as if he only inherited the beautiful features of his mom and dad.\u201cHuwah.\u201d The couple lowered down their voices as the baby yawned. Seo Eun-Hye patted the baby\u2019s belly while lying on the baby\u2019s bed lightly. Lee Min-Joon pressed the button on the CD player in the drawer, and a cute nursery rhyme flowed gently.* * *Baby Lee Seojun opened his eyes.\u2018Um.Lee Seojun thought. Everything was so big.The door in front of him was too big. It was the door of the library, which contained the memory of Lee Seojun\u2019s past life. The baby\u2019s hand, which was the same size as a maple leaf, tried to open the big library door.Yet, the door wouldn\u2019t open.It was obvious.He was sometimes born as a creature with substandard intelligence. He also had the instinct to stop by the library full of his memories.Having no intelligence, it was like being a fool would absorb everything with his eyes without thinking. Sometimes it was more than the capability of the \u201couter body,\u201d which resulted in the body breaking from 10 to 10.After a few such deaths, he shut the library tightly, and the door would only open when his mind was healthy enough to open.\u201cI give up opening this huge door.\u201dWith Lee Seojun\u2019s current ability, this large door would previously open wide just by touching it.Lee Seojun stirred his tiny hand. Like a revolving door, a large door disappeared from the side, and a smaller door appeared in front of Lee Seojun.There were many doors to the library. Every time a \u201cfool\u201d appears, it sets the standard of ability and builds a library.\u2026on second thought, there was so many \u2018fool\u2019s death.He made it easy to use. The larger the ability, the larger the door, and the smaller the capacity, the smaller the door.The size of the book containing the memories of life also varied. If it were an old and big monster\u2019s life, there were big and thick books, and if it were a small and short monster\u2019s life, there were small and thin books.Lee Seojun kept waving his hands. The door became smaller and smaller. As a baby, he passed a five-story building and a three-story building-sized door that he could not even look up, and finally, a blue door as big as a dog\u2019s house came out. It was the smallest library here.\u2018It\u2019s a library I built when I was slime.\u2019Lee Seojun sat on the floor in front of a small door and agonized over slime, a fool who died three days after his birth.The appearance in the library has changed along with the present body. Now seven months old, sitting on the floor all by himself was also great.A few weeks ago, he could only lie in front of the library door, staring at the tightly closed door. Sometimes, he turned upside down and tried to crawl.Perhaps, because his head was big, he was having difficulties sitting down, so Lee Seojun could only lay down.\u2018If it were like the previous time, I would have already opened it\u2026\u2026.\u2019The way to open the door was simple. All he had to do was touch the door of the library.Lee Seojun tried hard to turn and crawl, but he could only kick in the air.\u2018This human baby\u2019s growth is just too slow.\u2019The only books that he could see through this kind of door would be useless slime books that only have words such as jump and jump, or some useless books like fairy books, which are all about flying with glitter.When he was born again, he studied the situation he learned and recorded the skills necessary for his life. There must have been something forgotten because there were so many lives.This was the first time he was reborn as a human, so it was necessary to look at some books about what was appropriate to do and what was necessary to have.\u2018No, well. I don\u2019t think I need to fuss over this now.\u2019Eating, sleeping, and poopoo were the only things a baby needed\u2026Of course, every time he would be reborn again, he would remember the line (light) \u2013 [Elf\u2019s basic breathing method] until now since he had consciousness.Even though he was just a baby, his brilliant looks were all thanks to the basic breathing techniques he took from his elven life before.Lee Seojun also lowered his legs and turned them upside down. Now he finds it easy to flip over.\u2018Huh?\u2019After turning and lying on the floor, he was a tiny door next to the door as big as a dog house. It has the same size as Lee Seojun\u2019s face.This small door was a very dark, black door with dust, so it didn\u2019t seem to be noticeable.\u2018What I just found was great. I\u2019ve never seen any door like this before.\u2026.\u2019While tilting his head, he reached out and pressed the pattern of the door. The door opened slowly.He thrust his head into the door. He could only enter up to his shoulder, but it was okay. There was only one book in it.Lee Seojun pulled out his head, put his arm inside, and tried to take out the book inside. It was a book he had never seen before.The book that was taken out the door looked very old. It was filled with dust, and every piece of paper seemed to turn into dust and fly away.The baby slowly opened the book.The book was written in Korean.Lee Seojun knew from his memory, books that were recorded in Korean gradually changed into the letters of monsters over time. It was because the letters of the monster felt more comfortable to read.However, this book was all written in Korean.This was his first life.The only thing Lee Seojun remembers is that he was an unnamed actor. He didn\u2019t even remember how he died.The baby opened an old book on the floor and read it slowly. Although he couldn\u2019t understand many Korean words now, he slowly recalled the language from his memory and read it.The book was interesting.The man was also called Lee Seojun, like himself now, but he felt like a stranger because his memory was blurry. The story was about a man who tried hard to become an actor but died in an accident while filming without even being able to make his name known finally.\u2018Um.A short word was written at the end of the book. It must have been the memory that Lee Seojun thought at the end before he died.I want to be an actor even if I am born again. I want to be the main character in my next life.The baby sat in front of the old book, which was lying open on the floor. He was lost in thought for a while.After having experienced many lives, he felt a little nervous. He never thought that there was a time when he had lived a hard life like this that he left a wish to be fulfilled.There wasn\u2019t something like that in his previous lives.At first, he was busy surviving, and later, life was so boring.The baby suddenly grinned. Somehow he felt influenced by the book.All right! Let\u2019s do it, actor!The baby looked at the book before his eyes.\u2018No, let\u2019s not.\u2019He tapped on the book as if to console his previous life who died in vain.\u2018Why be an actor? When you could be a superstar!\u2019I will be a superstar that will go down in history.The baby promised so in front of the unknown actor\u2019s book.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you hungry?\u201dSeo Eun-Hye fed the seven-month-old Seo-jun alternately with baby food and powdered milk. But according to Seo-jun\u2019s personal preference, powdered milk was still delicious.*Chew-chew*As he was fed milk, Seo Jun was thinking about something.I decided to become an actor. No, I decided to become a superstar beyond an actor.Fortunately, this world was similar to my first life. It was too much to identify things with a baby\u2019s eyes, which still had a small range of activities in the house.On the television that his Dad and Mom watch, the same broadcasts from the previous life, such as news and entertainment programs, came out, but the faces of celebrities were strangers to him.Of course, many years have passed since his first life, this might be the same world as his first life, but he could not recognize them by still being a baby.Well, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u2019The baby was lying on a white, soft blanket while sucking in the powdered milk.It\u2019s delicious.The small two feet folded and unfolded.Seo Eun-Hye, as a mother, knew what the baby did whenever he was satisfied. She smiled and touched the baby\u2019s small feet.The bottom of his feet felt tickled at his mother\u2019s touch, so the baby shook both feet in the air.The milk no longer came out from the bottle. This means there was no more milk. The baby\u2019s small stomach was soon filled.The baby\u2019s body was shaking. Seo Eun-Hye held the baby and patted his back. Seojun put his cheek on his mother\u2019s shoulder.*Burp*\u201cOur Seojun. Aren\u2019t you eating too well? Hahaha.\u201d [1] Uri Seojun=, Our Seojun, is an intimate calling to a family member or someone very close to you.Eun-Hye burst into laughter at the baby\u2019s burping sound, and the baby also laughed with her.* * *Seo Jun thought. As an Actor, no, what does he need to do to be a superstar?The current \u201cbody,\u201d which can\u2019t even stand on its own, can only open a blue door as big as a dog house made during his life as a slime.Inside this door, there were only memories of living as a small monster, such as the memory of living as slime and living as a fairy as big as an adult\u2019s palm.Such monsters usually die early due to their short life span or because they die by becoming prey.\u2018Would that help?\u2019Seo-jun recalled the memories when he was a small slime.It was when I lived near Dragon Rare. A Slime, wandering near Dragon Rare to find food, was beaten to death by a half-awake dragon\u2019s Breath. It was probably a yawn. I died three days after I was born.Seo-jun shook his head from his flashback, and by recalling this memory, he felt like sighing, so he decided to go into the library.He pushed the blue door with my palm. Slowly the door opened, and two small-tier bookshelves lined up.Most of the books were as thin and small as baby picture books. There were few books with letters on them, and they were full of pictures drawn like in those fairy tales.Seo-jun crawled slowly and looked at the name of the book.[Slime 1][Slime 1-2]\u2026\u2026 [Fairy 1][Fairy 1-2][Fairy 2]\u2026\u2026 [Ant 1]\u2026\u2026 [Plant 1]\u2026\u2026.The bookcase was divided into monster types. He was reborn as a slime several times, the same as being a fairy. There were times when he reincarnated as the same type consecutively, and there were times when they were different. He couldn\u2019t remember everything.The Baby took the book [Slime 1], put it on the floor, and sat in front of it. It was a book with a big picture.There was a picture of green slime absorbing food and a picture of stretching tentacles and hitting trees.The Slime\u2019s abilities were recorded in pictures.\u2018Slime dissolves with acidic fluid and can extend the tentacles\u2026\u2026.\u2019It was what the baby thought. Slime was shaped like a droplet so that it could change its shape according to the mold. It seemed to be of no use other than that. It was a monster that even a child could catch.[Fairy 1] book opened.As a flower bloomed, a small fairy resembling a flower was lying in it. There was a picture of a fairy flying around and a picture of a flower falling asleep together on the last page.The picture reminded me of this fairy.In [Fairy 1], the fairy was a fairy of mischievous flowers. This fairy was born in flowers, smelled like flowers, and died together with the flower.It was characterized by its colorful appearance that resembles a flower. There was no special skill. It was just a fairy who died after living a happy life like a day.\u2018Looks good, but\u2026\u2026.\u2019Using this fairy\u2019s technique required a flower to be based on taking the ability. If he were to find a beautiful flower and register this technique, he would have a similar appearance to that flower.The problem is,\u2018If the flowers died, he would also die.\u2019No matter how long the flower can live, it will die when water lacks, the wind blows, the stem breaks, death, and when stepped on, the flower will die. Basically, the flower was a fragile creature.The baby quickly closed the book.He looked at the other books on the bookshelf.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s my first time to be a superstar that.\u2026. I don\u2019t know what I need.\u2019The uncertain future brought expectations. The baby slowly walked around the bookshelf and looked at the contents of the book.\u2018This isn\u2019t good.\u2026. This sounds good!\u2019Seojun chose two abilities.These were [the ability to digest] found in [Slime 3] and [the sparkle of fairies] found in [Fairy 15].[Slime\u2019s Ability to digest \u2013 Lowest Level]It digests anything. The excess nutrients of the digested object are replaced with the nutrients the body needs.Drain any ingredients that cause abnormal conditions.Although there will be no dramatic effect such as dislocation because it is the lowest level, but as he grows up like a baby, it would be a great help. Furthermore, it was clear that it would produce better synergy with [E.L.F.\u2019s basic breathing].[Fairy Glitter- Lowest]It is a glitter produced by fairy wings.Sparkling glitter will attract the attention of those who can see the fairy.Some people can see the fairy when they shake the glitter and follow the silhouette of the fairy.\u201cThe Fairy Glitter\u201d was a little extravagant, but he still chose it because he thought it would be good to be popular among his peers.\u2018Shouldn\u2019t my parents treat me like a celebrity when they see their son who\u2019s popular among with babies? Would they?\u2019The rice cake was supposed to be sprinkled in advance.The ability of slime to digest appeared in the shape of green round beads. Seojun lifted the bead with his hands and carried it over the boat.Spark!The bead, [the digestive power of slime], passed through the stomach and settled in the baby\u2019s small stomach.A blue pattern appeared on Seo-jun\u2019s plump belly. The bead-like pattern was visible only to Lee Seo-jun\u2019sThe fairy\u2019s glitter appeared in the shape of a small leaf cane carried by the fairy. Seo-jun brought the cane to his right index finger.The only body that could shake in the baby\u2019s current state was arms, legs, and small fingers, but he thought it might be a little strange to shake his legs and arms whenever he used glitter.Spark!The cane has been registered.\u2018Oh, this is\u2026.\u2019He would register it on his index finger, but the pattern was engraved on his palm with a tattoo smaller than [fairy\u2019s glitter \u2013 lowest level]. It was a green-colored pattern.The baby held his hand.Jam Jam Jam.\u2018\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t care.\u2019When the small fingers were folded, the green cane pattern disappeared and appeared again when the fingers were straightened.Jam jam jam.The baby\u2019s instinct was in a trance, holding one or two small hands and opening them up to see if the cane pattern that appeared and disappeared was fun.Jam jam jam.* * *\u201cSeo-jun really eats well.\u201dThe mother of Ji-Yoon, who was a seven-month-old baby girl, said.Ji-Yoon was born in March, the same as Seojun, she is also alternating between baby food and powdered milk like Seojun, but the baby hasn\u2019t eaten these days.She would shake her head, pushed away from the baby bottle, and even spit out the spoon of baby food even if it was already put in her mouth.Seo Eun-Hye brought some fruit from the kitchen.On Saturday afternoon, when everyone was off, Seojun\u2019s dad, who has a lot of work, went to work tod, even on this, so his mom called her friends.There was a meeting of mothers of babies of their age in the apartment where Seo Jun lives. There were five babies on one side of the living room.Lee Seo-jun, who just finished milk powder, Kim Ji-Yoon, who doesn\u2019t eat, Park Ji-ho, Park Ji-woo, twin brothers, and Mina Owen, whose father is American.They were all babies between 7 and 9 months.The babies played with their toys without paying attention to Seojun\u2019s toys. Seojun took out his dolls and played. For him, who was half relying on instinct and half rational, playing dolls was fun.Ji-Yoon\u2019s mother sighed. The same was true of other mothers. It would be nice if their babies also ate rice smoothly when they were hungry, but it was frustrating that they wouldn\u2019t eat even when hungry.Seo Eun-Hye said while peeling an apple.\u201cShe\u2019ll get better slowly. You said she wasn\u2019t sick.\u201dJi-Yoon, went to the hospital because her mother was worried about her not eating at all. Everyone was worried, but fortunately, there was no problem. Jiyoon\u2019s mother said she\u2019s just not like eating.\u201cHow much trouble would a baby cause have if she was a little older than this\u2026\u2026.\u201dEveryone sighed at the words of the twin\u2019s mother.Seo Eun-Hye, Seo Jun\u2019s mother, who doesn\u2019t know the difficulties of being a mother, smiled awkwardly.Since then, the mothers\u2019 stories have continued. There were talks about babies\u2019 plans to send them to the kindergartens, but nearby kindergartens were too competitive by recommending baby food ingredients that were good for their children.The baby, who was playing with other babies while fiddling with toys, was hungry.Seo-jun burst into tears, thinking that he needed to feed his body.\u201cYum yum.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s already time to eat?\u201dSeo Eun-Hye looked at the clock and said in surprise. Time was passing by before she knew it.When Seo-jun cried, other babies began to cry one after another.Whoo! Whoo!The living room was filled with the cries of babies. The mothers scrambled to take the powdered milk out from their bags.Seeing that, Seo-jun quickly stopped crying as if he had never cried.Mom will bring powdered milk soon, so there is no reason to cry anymore. I just needed to relax.However, the average baby, who only thought of eating, sleeping, and playing, kept crying.\u2018Did he just cry for nothing?\u2019The sharp cry hurt the fragile baby\u2019s ears.But if he didn\u2019t cry, he couldn\u2019t eat.Seo-jun shrugged his shoulders. He couldn\u2019t tell because he had a big head on his small shoulder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They bit it in their mouth rather than sucking them.They all cried because they were hungry, but the babies didn\u2019t want to eat at all.\u201cOh, Jiyoon. Eat some if you\u2019re hungry.\u201dJi-Yoon\u2019s mother sighed at the sight of her daughter, who was mumbling but never eating. The same was true of other babies.Seo-Jun was the only one who was drinking the powdered milk while sucking the nipple.Seo Eun-Hye hugged Seo-Joon while looking at the restless mothers.She didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but when she saw her son eating well, she felt she was in an awkward situation.Chew-chew-Being in his mother\u2019s arms, Seojun watched the situation.His mother was holding himself in embarrassment, while the others were also holding baby bottles in the babies\u2019 mouths, asking them to take a bite, and soothing babies to eat as if they understood the language.Chew-chew-Seojun, who was spacing out for a while sucking the powdered milk, raised his right hand.The babies seemed to be constantly noisy, and the mothers were likely to burst into tears.\u2018I don\u2019t know if this will work, but\u2026\u2026.\u2019On his baby\u2019s right hand, there was an invisible leaf-colored cane engraved.\u2018I\u2019ve never used it like this before.\u2026.\u2019It was his first time using the same ability as [the fairy\u2019s glitter].There was no need to use this pretense in the monster ecosystem. It was rather dangerous.It was refreshing to finally use this ability without fighting after only using the ability to fight and beat monsters every day.\u2018Sparkle.\u2019The fairy\u2019s glitter-the lowest-glow-shining. It catches the eyes of children who can see everything.The fairy\u2019s wings were originally supposed to sparkle, but Seojun had no wings, so his baby\u2019s hair and skin sparkled slightly.The eyes of the crying babies turned to Seojun, who was strangely sparkling. The mothers didn\u2019t seem to notice it.Only babies, who were unbiased and unspoiled, could see the fairy\u2019s glitter.When the babies stopped crying and looked at one place, the mothers\u2019 eyes also turned there.They were sitting on the floor, Seo Eun-Hye holding Seojun with one hand and supporting a baby bottle.Squeeze, squeeze, squish.She could only hear Seojun sucking his nipples.Seojun, who was drinking powdered milk, slowly shook his right hand. It\u2019s a shake of glitter.By using [The fairy\u2019s sparkles], someone will want to copy you.When the fairy\u2019s wings sparkled, the children were mesmerized by the sparkles.When the fairy danced, the children would also dance along.The fairies used to play tricks on those who copied them.Sometimes he brought the children into the forest and made them lost.Even when the fairies danced, sang, or did strange things, once the children were under its effect, they will most likely do it also.It was all due to the power of glitter.Squeeze, squeeze, squish.The sound of Seojun sucking his nipples came from the nipples in the mouths of other babies.Squeeze, squeeze, squish.Babies with the effect of glitter began to eat powdered milk.\u201cOh, my!\u201dThey didn\u2019t know why, but when the babies saw Seojun, they were also copying him.Where are the babies who cried and refused milk powder? Oh, my God! They were now eating very well as if there was such delicious powdered milk.\u201cSeojun is amazing!\u201d\u201cYeah. Everyone\u2019s eating after Seojun!\u201dThe mothers said excitedly.\u201cHow nice of you to eat like this!\u201dIn particular, Ji-Yoon, who hadn\u2019t been eating for the past few days, has her mother in tears.She cried and begged whenever it was time to eat, but Ji-Yoon still didn\u2019t eat. Ji-Yoon\u2019s mother had a headache and tears whenever it was mealtime.Other mothers also nodded.\u201cSo, that\u2019s it?\u201d Mina\u2019s mother said while sweeping Mina\u2019s gold hair, who was sucking her nipples diligently.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe mothers\u2019 eyes turned to Mina\u2019s mom. Mina\u2019s mom said with a grin.\u201cEating show in the baby world!\u201dMina\u2019s mother\u2019s words popped out of her mother\u2019s mouth.Eating show!Eating shows in the world of babies!\u201cHahaha!\u201dEveryone laughed at what Mina\u2019s mother, working as a vlogger who records and updates her daily life on YouTube, said half-jokingly.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cThis should be enough for a real mukbang!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a real mukbang star. Star!\u201dEating shows that combine delicious foods in front of the camera make viewers satisfied with their diet, but they also ordered the same menu to make viewers eat it.Seojun, who made babies eat with him, looked like a mukbang star.Hahahaha, the babies followed Seojun, who was drinking milk powder, to see if they were interested in mothers who laughed.Soon all the milk powder in the bottle disappeared, and the mothers hugged the baby.CharactersSeojoon/Seojun: The protagonistOh, my God!Seojun, who drank first, burped.Like a spinning song, the babies\u2019 burps rang in the living room. Fortunately, everyone burped well and didn\u2019t feel like throwing up the powdered milk.Again, with the babies on one side of the living room, mothers continued the story with relieved looks.\u201cSeojun\u2019s mom.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dJiYoon\u2019s mother called Seo Eun-Hye.Mina\u2019s mother said earlier was a joke, but her heart as a mother believes what she just said to feed her baby.Ji-Yoon\u2019s mother is a little embarrassed, but she would do it if it were for her daughter.\u201cSorry. Can you take a picture of Seojun eating and send it to me?\u201dEveryone was surprised by Jiyoon\u2019s mother\u2019s words.\u201cNo, that was a joke.\u201d Mina\u2019s mother said in a surprised tone.\u201cI know.\u201dTears were in Jiyoon\u2019s mother\u2019s eyes. The twin mother quickly pulled out the tissue and handed it to her.\u201cOur Jiyoon can\u2019t eat well, so she\u2019s smaller than her peers. So I\u2019m feeding her hard, but she doesn\u2019t eat at all\u2026\u2026.\u201dJiyoon\u2019s mother shed tears.All the Mothers\u2019 eyes turned to the babies. Jiyoon is definitely different from Seojun, who is seven months old. Of the five babies, Jiyoon was the smallest.Seo Eun-Hye shook her hand quickly, thinking that Seojun was unusually healthy and taller than her peers, although Seojun and Jiyoon had a difference in size.\u201cNo, no. Seojun looks like that because he\u2019s much taller than his peers of the same age.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I consulted with the hospital and said we have to feed her well\u2026\u2026 but\u2026.\u201dJiyoon\u2019s mother finally burst into tears. Jiyoon\u2019s face flinched when she noticed her mother\u2019s outburst.When Seojun saw the scene, he sighed inwardly and raised his right hand to release some fairy dust.\u2018I\u2019m not hungry, and I\u2019m not going to cry!\u2019[The fairy sparkles], catches the eyes of children who can see everything.Soon, Seojun\u2019s hair and skin sparkled. The babies\u2019 eyes are on the scene.\u2018Oh! I forgot.\u2019The babies flocked to Seojun. It was different from just now when he was safely in his mother\u2019s arms. Babies flocked to Seojun, who was on the floor and defenseless.They were babies who held everything in their hands and watched it in their mouths. There was something fascinating right in front of them that caught the babies\u2019 eyes. They couldn\u2019t have missed it.Shiny Seojun\u2019s hair and fingers entered the babies\u2019 mouths. It wasn\u2019t even powdered milk, but they were doing it fast.\u2018Mom!\u2019SeoJun saw Seo Eun-Hye, but Seo Eun-Hye was comforting Ji-Yoon\u2019s mother. His whole body was covered with the babies\u2019 saliva.He could have cried out loud, but the look on her face seemed to be telling a serious story.Seojun sighed and gave himself to the babies. He decided to sacrifice himself so that he wouldn\u2019t disturb the mothers\u2019 conversation.Squeeze, squeeze, squish.\u2018But why does it feel like the soul is being sucked?\u2019\u201cReally, I\u2019ll ask you once\u2026\u2026. Hmmm.\u201dJi-Yoon\u2019s mother put her hands together and asked for it. Eun-Hye\u2019s mind weakened in that way.His son ate well, slept well anywhere, and behaved well. He was never sick, and he was always healthy. This is actually quite rare to see when it comes to babies.She was also a mother, even if she raised him comfortably without worrying.She understood Jiyoon\u2019s mother very well. Moreover, it is just filming Seojun eating.It was not that Ji-Yoon would visit Seojun whenever she didn\u2019t eat. Seo Eun-Hye, who was thinking for a while and said.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take a picture and send it to you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dJiyoon\u2019s mom was surprised and asked back. Then, she squeezed Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s hands.\u201cI\u2019ll only show it to Jiyoon. Only to Jiyoon\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye said to Ji-Yoon\u2019s mother, who spoke in tears.\u201cBut, sister\u2026I don\u2019t know if Jiyoon will eat well even if I watch that video. Maybe it\u2019s just this time.\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it, though. I need a little bit of effect. She can eat it once out of ten times\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that Ji-Yoon\u2019s mom didn\u2019t think about it either. No, I honestly thought it was a coincidence.But wouldn\u2019t her daughter eat with her friend in the video? I thought. It was even a little good.A thin straw appeared before her drowning. She was going to grab this weak-looking straw. It was for her daughter, Jiyoon.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take a picture of Seojun when he eats and send it to you on Banana Talk. I\u2019m full now so that I won\u2019t eat.\u201dJiyoon\u2019s mother nodded as she wiped the tears that had finally stopped.\u201cThank you very much. Really\u2026 thank you\u2026\u2026. I will repay you\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll watch the video, and if Jiyoon eats well, give it to her then.\u201dThe twin mother and Mina\u2019s mother, looking at the two, thought a little bit and opened their mouths.\u201cWell, Seojun\u2019s mom. Can\u2019t you send it to me?\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that twins don\u2019t eat very well, but sometimes they don\u2019t\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause Mina doesn\u2019t eat baby food\u2026\u2026. Can I ask for a baby food version?\u201dEun-Hye nodded in the words of the two.\u201cYeah! We\u2019re just filming Seojun eating anyway. I\u2019ll take pictures of him eating either baby food or milk powder.\u201dOnly then did laughter return to other people\u2019s faces. Eun-Hye also smiled at her mothers\u2019 relieved face. And she turned to his son, who eats well and sleeps well.\u201cOh, Seojun!\u201d\u201cMina!\u201d\u201cJiho, Jiwoo!\u201d\u201cJiyoon!\u201dSeojun was half resigned to the babies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The door opened, and Dad appeared.Seojun crawled until in front of the front door. No, he tried to crawl, but his chubby arms rubbed the floor like he was wiping it.The baby\u2019s arms and legs rowed on the floor.Lee Min-Joon, who barely got off work after working until Saturday evening, hugged his son, who was trying to crawl back when he saw him.\u201cMy son!\u201dSeojun extended his arms to welcome his father. Lee Min-Joon kissed Seo Eun-Hye on the cheek while holding their son tightly within their arms.\u201cLet me Kiss my son, too!\u201d\u201cGo wash up for now!\u201dAt Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s words, SeoJun pushed Lee Min-Joon\u2019s cheek with both hands. Lee Min-Joon laughed. This scene was a hot one.Lee Min-Joon, who quickly washed up, hugged Seo Eun-Hye while she prepared dinner. Seo Eun-Hye talked about what happened during the day while preparing side dishes.\u201cSo when Seojun drank the powdered milk, everyone drank it after him also.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u201cI mean. You know Mina\u2019s mom is Vlogger, right?\u201dHearing Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s words, Lee Min-Joon recalled Mina\u2019s mother\u2019s video. There were videos of fusion dishes mixed with American and Korean home dishes or introducing small interior props.\u201cYeah, you showed it to me last time.\u201d\u201cYes, so Mina\u2019s mom said this could be an eating show for Seojun. He\u2019s like the mukbang star of the baby world.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye said in a smiling voice. Lee Min-Joon also saw his son playing with dolls with a big smile.He was happy to see my son having fun, but he would sigh without realizing it as he thought of him.The dolls that my son plays with were made by his friend when he was 5 months old.\u2026. In fact, Lee Min-jun was amazed by his son playing with these kinds of dolls.His wife and himself hoped for Seojun to abandon the dolls, but their son, who had never thrown a tantrum, cried and went wild.Lee Min-Joon\u2019s friend likes games, and he is good with his hands, so he often made figures, dolls, and miniatures. They were dolls that his friend made for him.They were so-called monster dolls.Ugly green oak and auger, twin head troll with two heads\u2026\u2026and a dragon with big wings. The dragon, which was well made, looked very scary, and other dolls did not look very cute.\u2018Is this a waste of talent\u2026.?\u2019His son often played many games like knocking down an oak dragon, and he looked so excited that he couldn\u2019t stop him.For example, at this moment, Seojun was hitting a dragon doll with a small slime in his hand.\u201cOh, my gosh!\u201dHe seemed completely excited.\u201cShould I stop that?\u201dLee Min-Joon was worried that his son would become violent.Seo Eun-Hye came out to the living room after preparing dinner.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Seojun is actually very nice.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cHe had been with other babies for a while today. But he didn\u2019t hit other people and stayed still.\u201d\u201cWas he uncomfortable?\u201dLee Min-Joon was surprised. He recalled Seojunas as someone who couldn\u2019t tolerate other people.Recognizing his thoughts, Eun-Hye held Seo-Joon up and shook her head.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. Seojun like being popular.\u201d\u201cOh, aha. That\u2019s a relief.\u201dLee Min-Joon also headed to the table.There was a nice Korean dish, including delicious soybean paste stew and egg roll. Seojun also sat on the baby chair.Although Seojun was sitting together with them, he didn\u2019t eat right away. He waited first for the couple before starting eating.He had his revenge on the dragon who killed him just before he was born as slime. They might be a figurine, but it is still an achievement to be celebrated by having a delicious meal.Seojun, who was so excited, swung his arms.\u201cHahaha!\u201d\u201cYou must be really excited.\u201dLee Min-Joon pinches the baby in the cheek. Seo Eun-Hye brought rice and started eating.\u201cSo I took a picture of him drinking powdered milk earlier, but I think I should also take a picture of him eating baby food. Seojun has shorthands, so he may not reach the bowl while eating.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll feed him and take a picture of him soon. Let\u2019s do it after I finish this dish.\u201dLee Min-Joon answered and immediately started gulping down the dinner.\u2014After dinner, it was the baby\u2019s turn to eat.Seojun, sitting on the baby chair, saw his father looking for a camera in the drawer while his Mom was warming up the baby food.\u2018You\u2019re saying I have to use glitter, right?\u2019Seo Jun remembered what happened during the day.He heard the mothers asking Seo Eun-Hye for pictures because the babies couldn\u2019t eat well.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect the glitter to be used like this\u2026\u2026.\u2019I thought it would be popular with babies because their skin and hair were shiny. I didn\u2019t know that feeding babies to keep their mouths shut would come back like this.\u201cSeojun, let\u2019s eat!\u201dSeojun looked at his mother and saw his father with a deep sigh. He was a parent to a little boy who ate well and slept well, but other parents had trouble raising a child.\u2018I can\u2019t help it.\u2019The problem was that the fairy glitter was in the palm of his hand. If it was on his fingers, he could slightly shake it away from the camera, but\u2026\u2026he had to wave his arms to shake his palms.In addition, it was clear that it would look strange if only the right arm with the pattern were shaken.\u2018Do I have to raise both arms? I never raised my arms and shook them while I was eating\u2026\u2026.\u2019Lee Seo-Joon looked at his dad, who called him, hoping his mom and dad wouldn\u2019t think it was weird.I got a message! A message!\u201cIt must be here!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201dJiyoon\u2019s mother, Lee So-young, still didn\u2019t have dinner. The same was true for Jiyoon\u2019s father, who left work earlier because the couple\u2019s precious only daughter did not eat again.\u201cBut I\u2019m glad you ate it once during the day\u2026\u2026.\u201dLee So-young was really about to cry at her husband\u2019s words. However, she opened Banana Talk quickly, with her eyes wide open and holding back tears. Seojun\u2019s mother posted two videos in the group room.This is the powdered milk version.This is the baby food version. Sorry, I\u2019m late!Lee So-young quickly types a message.No! Thank you so much!Then she quickly played the video. Among the two videos, they choose the video where Seojun eat more nutritious food. After hearing the story of the day from Lee So-young, her husband also watched the video.Seojun, sitting on a baby chair, was looking at the camera. They heard a man\u2019s voice quietly, saying, \u201cSeojun, look this way.Seojun\u2019s eyes turned to the camera in his father\u2019s voice. A small bowl of baby rice was put up in front of Seojun, who was laughing. A small baby spoon was held in Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s hand.\u201cSeojun, let\u2019s eat!\u201dSeo Eun-Hye\u2019s words made Seojun\u2019s mouth open wide. The spoon disappeared into Seojun\u2019s mouth. Hap! The mouth was murmuring. At that time, Seojun\u2019s hands were lifted and shaken.\u201cHuh? Is it because you\u2019re excited? Is it that good?\u201dSeojun opened his mouth again at Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s words. The baby food had disappeared before he knew it. Seo Eun-Hye put baby food back into his mouth.Seojun was filmed eating for about 10 minutes.Lee So-young said in a well-shot video.\u201cOkay! Let\u2019s eat, Jiyoon!\u201dAt his wife\u2019s words, the husband rushed to the kitchen to heat the baby food. While preparing to feed the baby food, the couple doubted whether the video would work. However, the couple, who wanted for the well-being of their daughter, quickly headed for their daughter.They fixed my smartphone in front of Jiyoon, who was sitting on the chair.\u201cUh-huh.\u201dJiyoon started to whine. Jiyoon\u2019s father quickly put baby food on the table. Lee So-young opened the moderately cold baby food with a spoon and pressed the video\u2019s start button.\u201cSeojun, look this way!\u201dThe video started again.At the same time, Jiyoon\u2019s father also said.\u201cJiyoon, look this way!\u201dJiyoon turned her head to where she heard her father\u2019s voice. A smartphone came into her sight. Seojun was in there.Lee So-young quickly pushed the spoon into Jiyoon\u2019s mouth.Jiyoon saw. Seojun, who raised his arms, shone again. And for some reason, she wanted to copy Seojun. The simple baby copied what was in front of her.When Seojun opened his mouth, Jiyoon opened her mouth. When Seojun mumbled with a spoon in his mouth, Jiyoon bit the spoon, too. There was baby food on the spoon. When baby food came into her mouth, Jiyoon mumbled and swallowed it.\u201cShe ate it!\u201dLee So-young clenched her fist.\u201cShe ate!\u201dJiyoon\u2019s father, who was about to shout at the joy that her daughter finally ate, swallowed the sound with difficulty in the taste of her wife\u2019s hands on her thighs. It was because his wife was staring at him with her eyes on fire.The wife whispered lazily, barely opening her lips.\u201cBe quiet! She has to eat a whole bowl!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe couple quietly fed their daughter baby food. Jiyoon quickly finished a bowl of baby food as if the hardship she had been suffering was a lie. The couple was covered with tears.Lee So-young patted Ji-Yoon on the back. Jiyoon\u2019s eyes slowly closed after eating full. Tears formed in the couple\u2019s eyes as they were looking at their daughter, who had fallen asleep.They thought it was a big problem because she didn\u2019t eat so much, so they went to the hospital. They made all the milk powder that babies like and the delicious baby food, bought it, and fed it, but all failed. The more they failed, the more they felt ashamed that they didn\u2019t deserve to be her parents.Lee So-young, who can laugh now, told her husband.\u201cShould we buy Seojun a present?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do it! And send a message! As Jiyoon said, she ate well. And a Thank you.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah.\u201dPutting Jiyoon on her bed, Lee So-young picked up her smartphone. The group room was already full of messages. It was Mina\u2019s mom and twin mom.Oh, my God! What\u2019s going on? Mina is done eating! She didn\u2019t even complain about food!The twins ate it all! In a flash!Lee So-young also left a message.Jiyoon ate, too.It\u2019s only her second time eating today. Thank you very much!Seo Eun-Hye, who read the message, said to Lee Min-Joon, who was putting his son to sleep. The son, who had a good meal, fell asleep on a fluffy blanket while dozing off half. His chubby cheeks were adorable.\u201cEveryone\u2019s working.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.Maybe they just ate it because they were hungry?\u201dTo Lee Min-Joon, who has only seen his son who eats well, the baby who does not eat was a little strange. Seo Eun-Hye knew the mothers\u2019 hearts a little bit because she was the baby mother\u2019s friend.\u201cA person who doesn\u2019t eat really doesn\u2019t eat. Jiyoon\u2019s mom even went to the hospital.\u201d\u201cTo the hospital?\u201dOnly then did Lee Min-Joon, who didn\u2019t know the seriousness, patted Seojun\u2019s stomach.Lee Min-Joon and Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s son were really gentle and nice children.\u201cI hope it works tomorrow and the day after tomorrow\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSurely.\u201dSeojun\u2019s milk powder mukbang and baby food mukbang, as the couple wished, had a great effect tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe effect of Seojun\u2019s video did not end once.A week later, Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s banana talk accumulated a lot of messages. It was a message from mothers praising Seojun\u2019s video.They ate today, too!Wow! Jiyoon ate everything without skipping a meal!I think twins weigh twice as much as before now.The twin mother\u2019s words were a joke, but all the other mothers actually weighed their children. In particular, Jiyoon really gained a lot of weight, making her Mom and Dad cry.\u201cSeojun seems to be growing too fast.\u201dLee Min-Joon saw the picture that Seo Eun-Hye sent.She sent Seojun\u2019s picture through banana talk, which she just took, and Seojun sat on the baby scale with his hands holding an oak with green skin and smiling brightly.Every week, they sent each other a picture of Seojun being weighted.Lee Min-Joon was impressed by his huge weight. Well, his son was a child who ate well, slept well, and behaved well. Rather, if he didn\u2019t gain weight, they had to worry.\u201cOh, is that Seojun?\u201dKim Hee-Sung is here. Kim Hee-sung glanced at Lee Min-Joon\u2019s phone.\u201cOk? That\u2019s what I sent you. Do you still like it?\u201dLee Min-Joon sighed. Kim Hee-sung smiled awkwardly, sweeping the back of his neck. A cold sweat fell behind his back.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d really like it.\u201dHee-Sung just wanted to tease Seojun, who was always smiling. Kim Hee-sung, who wanted to see Seojun crying out of fear, jokingly put a large box full of monster dolls and took them to Lee Min-Joon\u2019s house.He was quite excited seeing him cry but\u2026\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Seojun to like it so much.\u2026.\u201dLee Min-Joon recalled that time.As soon as he opened the box, he screamed high-pitched.He immediately closed the box because he was scared that when his son saw that he would cry and hit the box.But unexpectedly Seojun looked like he was shouting \u2018Open! Open!\u2019 so Lee Min-Joon had no choice but to open the box.\u201cHe had become completely attached to the dolls\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAhahaha. Sorry.\u201dLee Seojun crawled into the box and buried himself with the dolls and smiled. Kim Hee-sung was also surprised by Seojun\u2019s reaction, so he was at a loss.At that time, Seo Eun-Hye stood vainly holding a toy-rabbit doll, which was abandoned by Lee Seojun.\u201cBut Seojun has a very unique taste.\u201d\u201cAre you in a position to actually say that\u2026\u2026.?\u201dKim Hee-sung, who has been scolded by Lee Min-Joon and Seo Eun-Hye for about a week, raised his hands at Lee Min-Joon\u2019s low words.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d\u201cSigh, no. I gave up now.\u201dLee Min-Joon opened a gallery of his smartphone and showed Seojun\u2019s picture.Seojun was holding an oak, Seojun was smiling with slime in his left hand, and on the other hand, was a dragon.Kim Hee-sung bowed quietly.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201dSeojun was smiling cutely, but the dolls in his arms were scary. He even doubted his mom and dad\u2019s taste. Kim Hee-Sung had no choice but to apologize.Lee Min-Joon nodded. Kim Hee-Sung\u2019s apology will be up until Seojun will change his taste.But Lee Min-Joon would have never thought that he\u2019d hear Kim Hee-sung\u2019s apology for the rest of his life.\u2026.Kim Hee-sung sat down. He was able to take it easy today because he just finished his work by Saturday. Maybe it would have been better to work today\u2026\u2026.Lee Min-Joon showed a video clip to Kim Hee-sung, who was sitting there without motivation.Kim Hee-sung already predicted that the video would be about SeoJun, Eun-Hye, or Seojun together with his mom.Well, he wasn\u2019t wrong though.\u201cSeojun eats well, too!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re out of arms.\u201dHowever, Kim Hee-sung also thought Seojun was very, very cute. He was so cute as if he was born with the good and hidden good points of his real mom and dad.Kim Hee-sung, who was watching Seo-Joon eating baby food, opened his mouth. Seo-Joon, who was eating with his arms waving, caught my eye.\u201cBut why was he waving?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dWhen asked by Kim Hee-sung, Lee Min-Joon shook his head as if he didn\u2019t know. Seojun did not wave when he ate baby food this morning. What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201cExcited?\u201d\u201cEating food? Is he like that every time he eats?\u201dLee Min-Joon shook his head, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d Kim Hee-sung was lost in thought. What\u2019s different from usual\u2026\u2026.\u201cCamera?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Camera?Lee Min-Joon watched the video due to Kim Hee-sung\u2019s words. There was Seojun, waving his arms and smiling brightly.\u201cMaybe he likes cameras? So he waved his arms in excitement.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cOh, Seojun is going to be an actor.\u201dAt Kim Hee-sung\u2019s words, Lee Min-Joon watched the video again. Argh! he heard Seojun\u2019s laughter.\u201cWow, really\u2026\u2026when Jiyoon and I went to the hospital, I could only hear compliments.\u201dEun-hye smiled at Ji-yoon\u2019s mother\u2019s words.It\u2019s already been two weeks since she sent a video of Seojun eating. The five babies ate well without leaving a single meal.\u201cJiyoon can eat well now even without watching Seojun\u2019s videos these days.\u201dThe twin\u2019s mother also nodded at Mina\u2019s mother\u2019s words.\u201cAfter watching Seojun\u2019s video for a few days, I thought he wouldn\u2019t be able to eat if he didn\u2019t watch the video, but now he eats well even if he doesn\u2019t watch the video.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u2026. There was a little squabble in the middle of it\u2026\u2026.\u201dEun-hye was also happy with the words of her three mothers. With a bright smile, she cut the cake that Mina\u2019s mom made and brought it to her plate.It was a whipped cream cake full of strawberries. It was as if they were congratulating each other for being able to solve their worries.As soon as everyone seemed to have such an idea, they became speechless for a while;.Seo Eun-hye looked at the three mothers. There was no makeup on their faces, but the faces of the three mothers who solved their worries were sparkling.Seo Eun-hye was easily moved to tears. The same was true of other mothers.Jiyoon\u2019s weak-minded mother shed tears first.\u201cReally, thank you\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026.\u201d\u201cReally, really\u2026\u2026thank you\u2026.\u201dSomeone might say it was just a baby problem, but\u2026\u2026it was more distressing for parents having their child unable to eat properly.\u201cThey eat well, have fun, sleep well.\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only been two weeks.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been so happy for the past two weeks.\u201dMina\u2019s mom also said. In the past few weeks, Mina had been eating very well and she started gaining weight a bit. The mother was thankful to Seojun for that.\u201cMy sons are getting stronger, aren\u2019t they?\u201dEveryone wiped their tears and burst into laughter at the twin mother\u2019s joke. The babies laughed at the mothers\u2019 laughter.Seojun was also surprised to hear the mothers words.\u2018The video also worked, didn\u2019t it?\u2019It was his first time using ability through a medium called video, so he thought it would not work. But listening to the mothers, it seems to be successful.He didn\u2019t expect it, but it was a good story.\u2018If my ability like [fairy sparkle] works through video\u2026\u2026. It\u2019ll be easier to be a superstar this way.\u2019Seojun smiled and hugged the doll Kim Hee-sung gave him a few days ago. It was a doll of King Lich, a black wizard, that Kim Hee-sung made by hand.Seo Eun-hye was frightened by the crown-wearing skeleton doll \u2013 which looked scarier with green cubics in his eyes \u2013 but Seojun thought it was so good that he hugged him all week.The babies have drifted away from the smiling Seojun because King Lich\u2019s green eyes were like staring at babies.While talking and eating the cake, Mina\u2019s mom opened her mouth carefully.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, why don\u2019t you upload Seojun\u2019s video on YouTube?\u201d\u201cYouTube?\u201dMina\u2019s mother nodded at Seo Eun-hye\u2019s question.\u201cI\u2019m posting a vlog on YouTube.\u201dMothers\u2019 ears tilted.\u201cI was uploading my Vlogs and I was also uploading Mina\u2019s appearance little by little. Recently I shared the story of Mina being unable to eat very much and surprisingly there were a lot of viewers who say that their sons and daughters don\u2019t eat much either.\u201dSeo Eun-hye and her mothers nodded. Seojun, who was waving King Lich\u2019s hand and drawing a magic pattern on a mat with clouds, also nodded.Mina\u2019s mother looked at Seo Eun-hye as if she was a little sorry and said. \u201cBut for the past two weeks, I\u2019ve been bragging about how Mina can eat well and she can now eat baby food without leaving anything behind.\u201dJiyoon\u2019s mom and twin mom flinched. It was because they also bragged to their parents and in-laws that their children eat well these days.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Seojun can\u2019t even talk about it.\u201dSeo Eun-hye shook her head.\u201cSo, please tell me how to eat well for babies. Besides the comments, his baby doesn\u2019t eat much\u2026I heard they even went to the hospital.\u2026.\u201dEveryone looked at Jiyoon\u2019s mom in the hospital story. Jiyoon\u2019s mother shrugged. Now Jiyoon is a good eater. She didn\u2019t worry about her.\u201cFirst of all, I will just put up the milk powder brand and baby food recipes that Mina eats. Eun-hye, if you don\u2019t mind, I want you to upload Seojun\u2019s video on YouTube to help the mothers.\u201d\u201cWell, I see.\u201dSeo Eun-hye is lost in thought. The mothers quietly waited for Seo Eun-hye\u2019s thoughts to end.\u2018Should I upload Seojun\u2019s video? Wouldn\u2019t it be good?\u2019 Seo Eun-Hye thought it over.Seojun\u2019s face was going up in the video. Seojun\u2019s opinion was needed more than anyone else, but her son was now a seven-month-old baby who could only crawl around with his father and mother. The baby\u2019s mother and father had to make a decision.\u2018First of all, the good thing is\u2026\u2026 It will help babies who don\u2019t eat. The baby\u2019s parents can solve their worries.And the bad thing is that Seojun\u2019s face will be known\u2026\u2026.\u2019There could be other good things and bad things, but she couldn\u2019t decide alone because it was Seojun\u2019s job.After thinking, Seo Eun-hye opened her mouth.\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019ll discuss it with my husband.\u201d\u201cYes, you don\u2019t have to do it immediately! Think about it a lot and decide.\u201dEun-hye nodded in Mina\u2019s mother\u2019s words.\u2018I would ask Seojun if only he could speak\u2026\u2026.\u2019Seo Eun-hye looked at her son, who was wiping the mat with the hands of a deadly skeleton doll.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seojun held a small dog doll.According to Kim Hee-sung, this was a wolf version of a werewolf doll that transformed into a human form when looking at the full moon.Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon sighed, looking at the doll\u2019s snout-flashing teeth spread out with sharp eyes as if their eyes were alive, but Seojun was happy to hear Kim Hee-sing\u2019s explanation.Next time, he will also give him the human version as a gift.He was really a wonderful uncle.\u201cUgh.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. I am the king of Skeleton. King Lich, Edmund!\u201dAt Seojun\u2019s whining, Lee Min-Joon awkwardly looked at the paper and spat out his lines, and moved the skeleton doll.It was a line written by Seojun\u2019s best playmate, Kim Hee-sung, looking at Seojun, who always reacts fast whenever he plays with a monster doll.\u2018Seojun really likes reality shows.\u2019(Not the reality shown like survivals in TV, but a live show of puppets for kids, but here it was written like a reality show.)\u2018Is this even a reality show?\u2019\u201cLook! Seojun!\u201d\u201cUgh?\u201d\u201cI will destroy the low dragon, the black dragon, the world! Ouch!Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dSeojun, who was so excited, hit his father, and Lee Min-Joon looked at the paper again.There were lines on the paper that he couldn\u2019t say. When Lee Min-Joon tried to put down the paper, Seojun grabbed his father\u2019s hand.\u201cFoolish.\u201dLooking at his son\u2019s sparkling eyes, Lee Min-Joon sighed and opened the paper again.\u201cMy servant, my subordinates. Follow my command\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cOh, Seojun\u2019s father. My son wants you to add more emotion.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye, who was sitting on the sofa and drinking tea, said with a giggle. Lee Min-Joon swept his face with one hand.\u201cSeojun\u2019s mother. You are making fun of me now.\u201d\u201cI love playing with Hee-sung, too.\u201d\u201cOh, my!\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. You want me to play with you instead of talking to you?How do you know your son\u2019s mind so well?\u201dSeojun smiled and listened to the werewolf version doll. The wolf doll\u2019s blue fur sparkled as to what he had done.King Lich and the werewolf!King Lich almost won, but the baby\u2019s play was different. His dad used to say a few awkward lines and bump into Seojun\u2019s wolf doll and skull doll.\u201cArgh! I lost!\u201dSeojun\u2019s werewolf won.This game that always wins was really good for the baby. Seo Eun-Hye hugged Seojun, who was having fun. She patted the baby\u2019s stomach to calm him down.\u201cHahaha.\u201d\u201cOh, my. Seojun won!\u201d\u201cSeojun is amazing!\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s soothing or exciting.\u2019Seojun\u2019s arms and legs shook the air at the couple\u2019s words.Listening to his mom and dad\u2019s compliments, his body was shaking and his heart was beating fast. Seojun couldn\u2019t say it, but he shouted inside.\u2018I\u2019m cool! Amazing!\u2019The baby\u2019s instinct beat Seojun\u2019s reason. Since then, Seo Eun-Hye, who had been playing with her son for a while, said. It was about YouTube that Mina\u2019s mom suggested.\u201cSo why don\u2019t we upload the video on YouTube?\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell.\u201d\u201cBut when Seojun grows up and asks why we posted such a thing\u2026What should we do?\u201dLee Min-Joon laughed at the words of Seo Eun-Hye, a worried mother.\u201cIt\u2019s just a baby video. And by the time Seojun started to realize things, he would have forgotten about it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, this is my idea.\u2026.\u201dLee Min-Joon recalled a conversation with Kim Hee-sung.Kim Hee-sung looked at Seo-Joon, who was waving his arms, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if he likes the camera, but he has the constitution to become an actor.\u201dWouldn\u2019t Lee Min-Joon do the same? He was leaning towards the suggestion.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be good for Seojun to be on camera?\u201d\u201cSeojun?\u201d\u201cLook, he would behave when eating. But when we were filming with the camera, he really liked it and even waved his arms.\u201d\u2018I have to wave my arms to use the fairy glitter. Father.\u2019Seojun thought while listening to Lee Min-Joon. But it was not a bad approach. Seojun was the baby\u2019s body, which can only do small things to express himself.\u2018To be a superstar it would be good to be famous from an early age.\u2019It would have been great if they thought that Seojun thought liked the camera and his parents would lead Seojun in that direction. Thinking about thins, Seojun grinned.Suddenly, Seo Eun-Hye patted Seo-Joon, smiling, and thought of what happened two weeks ago. Seojun, who was shaking his arms and eating excitedly, came to mind her.Come to think of it, for the first time, there was a camera in front of Seojun while he was eating.\u201cBut did he know what a camera is like?\u201dThe baby, who was eating a small round fist, smiled brightly at Seo Eun-Hye.Lee Min-Joon said with a shrug.\u201cHe whined earlier that my acting was not cool.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dAt Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s exclamation, Lee Min-Joon also looked as if he had realized what he just said. Both the face of Lee Min-Joon, Eun-Hye looked absurd.\u201cWhy are you surprised? You were the one who pointed it out.\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think much about it.\u2026. Is it just\u2026 I think my son is really amazing.\u201dLee Min-Joon spoke in an admiring voice.\u201cHow did he know that my acting was awkward?\u201d\u201cYour voice wasn\u2019t natural, and it keeps cutting off?\u201d\u201cWell, we wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201dLee Min-Joon nodded. Seo Eun-Hye raised Seojun and made eye contact. Seojun smiled, thinking, \u2018I understand everything.\u2019\u201cMy son. Isn\u2019t he a genius?\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s a real genius.\u201d\u201cSeven months, no, eight months! What about the other eight months of babies?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dIn Lee Min-Joon\u2019s question, Eun-Hye faced Seojun, who was smiling in the air.\u201cOur Seojun grew up especially fast.\u201d\u201cOh! Seojun looks great!\u201dThe couple\u2019s eyes turned to their son. Seojun ate his fist with his mouth as if he didn\u2019t know anything.\u201cThen it\u2019s final\u2026 Should we let our son act?\u201d\u201cActing\u2026.\u201dIn the minds of Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon, the baby roles and child actors in dramas and movies passed by. And it reminded them of some actors who successfully became adult actors from being child actors.After that, however, the actors who failed to escape their image as children eventually quit acting.Mom and Dad\u2019s worries have deepened. Seojun, who was in Seo Eun-he\u2019s arms, shook his arm with the sound of Abu- bu-bu.\u2018Mom and Dad, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s important right now!\u2019\u201cOh, that\u2019s not the problem.\u201dThen Seo Eun-Hye, who came to her senses, said, it was too early to think that he was already an actor or actress. At least the couple\u2019s child had to grow up until they expressed their opinions. Lee Min-Joon, who noticed Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s thoughts, also wanted to.\u201cSo it\u2019s okay to put it on YouTube, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I agree. I heard Jiyoon\u2019s mother had a hard time because she didn\u2019t know how to do it. I also don\u2019t know, but I will definitely become good at it with the help of others.\u201cI see. Then post it on youtube!\u201dSeo Eun-Hye handed over Seojun to his father\u2019s arms and Seo Eun-Hye picked up her smartphone. It was to contact Mina\u2019s mom.<<Minju!>>- Eun-Hye<<I\u2019ve discussed it with my husband and I think it\u2019s okay to post it on YouTube!>>-Eun-Hye<<Really?>>- Minju<<Then make an account with your name and upload it!>> -Minju<<My name? Can\u2019t I just post it on your channel?>> -Eun-Hye<<Eun-hye, you didn\u2019t know that I and the others watch the video of SeoJun several times a day!>>-Minju<<If you count them all, they\u2019re really high!>>- Minju<<I\u2019m sure the other moms will see a lot of them, so if you apply for a profit and post an ad, they\u2019ll make money!>>-Minju<<Seojun could buy you something delicious!>>-Minju\u201cIs that so?\u201dLee Min-Joon, who was looking at KakaoTalk\u2019s screen with Seo Eun-Hye, nodded.Their baby fell asleep because he played hard. His eyes closed by themselves. The couple\u2019s voices became smaller when they realized that fact.\u201cI never thought of advertising. I think it\u2019s good. I can use it for Seojun\u2019s education later and he can do everything he wants to do.\u201dIn Lee Min-Joon\u2019s words, Eun-Hye said after thinking for a while. She also wanted to let Seojun do everything he wanted to do as Lee Min-Joon said.But it was only a video of a baby eating. With this kind of video should it be able to attract viewers?\u201cWill it be just that?\u201dIt occurred to them that they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201cYou want to make money out of Seojun?\u201dEun-Hye laughed at Lee Min-Joon\u2019s light joke.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not trying to make a lot of money.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye came out of the room with her laptop. She held her laptop on the table and logged in to youtube.It was actually easy to upload videos on YouTube, so Eun-he quickly created a channel.\u201cWhat should we name the channel?\u201dKakaotalk! Kakaotalk! (The message ring when receiving a message. Well, it is not really someone saying kakaotalk but the raws says this.)She just received a message from Kakaotalkk. It was the Youtuber Mom, Mina\u2019s mom.<<I forgot, but the name of the channel should be English and Korean!>><<English?>><<There are English-speaking mothers on my channel!>><<Aren\u2019t Korean babies the only ones who don\u2019t eat? Even foreigners don\u2019t eat?>><<No one will find the title in Korean!>>\u201cEnglish\u2026.\u201dMina\u2019s mother\u2019s message deepened the couple\u2019s thoughts. \u201cMy son doesn\u2019t only sleep well but he also behaves well,\u201d said Lee Min-Joon, while patting Seojun on the back when he fell asleep.It was out of the blue, but he didn\u2019t think it was strange at all. Mom and dad were happy with the baby\u2019s small advantages.\u201cHe\u2019s a real filial son.\u201d\u201cI know. My son is the best!\u201d\u201cNo, wait. Think of the channel name. Seojun\u2019s father!\u201dLee Min-Joon smiled at Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s monologue.\u201cLet\u2019s make it simple. I\u2019m going to upload only two videos anyway.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Then Seojun? Seojun?\u201d\u201cSeo\u2019s a little weird, how about Jun?\u201dThat\u2019s how the channel was named.[JUN]\u201cIsn\u2019t it too simple?\u201dSeo Eun-Hye tilted her head and posted a video. While doing so she just realized it needed a Title.\u201cWhat!\u201dShe didn\u2019t think she would need to come up with a good title.\u201cWhat about the video\u2019s title?\u201d\u201cJust write the baby food version, the milk powder version. Mina\u2019s mother will explain.\u201dIt was Mina\u2019s mom who introduced Seojun\u2019s video first.\u201cShould I?\u201dSeo Eun-Hye, a cold person, posted a video at Lee Min-Joon\u2019s words.[Reason version: baby food. ver][Breaking version: baby formula.ver]Seo Eun-Hye sent a Kakao talk message to Mina\u2019s mom.<<Sister!>>Lee Min-Joon hugged Seojun and waved lightly toward the bedroom. A low word flowed from his mouth like a lullaby.\u201cOur Seo-Joon is going to be very famous now! Then we\u2019ll buy you a car. we\u2019ll buy you a car also we\u2019ll buy you a house.\u201c\u201cPoof!\u201dSeo Eun-Hye, who was sending a message burst into laughter at Lee Min-Joon\u2019s words. He also smiled quietly when he heard Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s laugh. Seo Eun-Hye responded to Lee Min-Joon.\u201cOkay, Seojun bought a car and a toy.\u201d\u201cWe will be going on a trip~\u201d<<I uploaded a video!>><<The channel is called [JUN] and the video is the same as the one I sent last time! Baby food version and milk powder version.>><<Thank you so much! I\u2019ll definitely promote it!>>A chilly fall, one night.In a small apartment in Korea, a video that will forever be the number one among the best 10 videos selected by parents around the world who were raising a baby has been uploaded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But\u2026\u201cMaria\u2026.\u201d He was about to cry now.His son, Jack Smith, had been silent since morning, saying he would not eat anything.It\u2019s only been two days since he was alone with his son. Eric was embarrassed at first. It\u2019s already been 30 minutes since he had a scuffle with his son. Eric regretted it.\u2018Why didn\u2019t I learn then?\u2019He could see my wife trying to feed me another spoon.\u201cNoooo!\u201dSitting on the baby chair! Seeing his son hitting a small table with his hands, he felt like he was going to get sick.Eric, who was playing with a small spoon as if they were airplanes, eventually took his phone out as the last resort, trying to feed him in all sorts of ways.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to disturb you\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t help but want to feed his son.<<Honey, Jack doesn\u2019t eat: What should I do?>><<Jack has his favorite yogurt in the fridge. Feed it to him.>><<He is not eating it.>>Park Maria, who was on a business trip in France, sighed when she saw her husband\u2019s message.\u201cTwo days\u2026.\u201dHer son was very grumpy. So she prepared a lot of Jack\u2019s favorite foods in the refrigerator and thought it could work in these two days.Before leaving, she stuffed a lot of sweets that she didn\u2019t even feed to him in the refrigerator, but it didn\u2019t work.\u201cOh, my\u2026.\u201dShe had to stay in Paris for three more days.No, it could only be 3 days if things go well. But now.\u201cManager! This hasn\u2019t arrived yet!\u201dSomeone screamed and shook the paper. Surprised by him, the head of the department jumped out of his seat and picked up the phone.He pressed the number like lightning and waited for the other person to receive it. The manager shook his legs, showing his nervousness.RING! RING!~Honey\u2026~\u201cNot, now. What if they still don\u2019t send it? There\u2019s not much time left, don\u2019t you know that\u2019s the most important thing?\u201dMaria swept her face with her hands at the sight of the head of the department shooting at her before the other person could speak.\u201cThe arrival wouldn\u2019t be able to make it within a week\u2026\u2026.\u201dPark Maria sighed from the inside. Then she sent a message. The recipient was Eric Smith, her husband.<<You know, it\u2019s papa, right? ;)>><<Honey?!>>\u201cMaria? Maria?!\u201dEric shook his smartphone. It was a cry that could not be heard, but Eric could not give up his last resort like this. He shouted hoping to hear it all the way to Paris, France.\u201cMaria!!\u201d\u201cNoooo!Eric fell on the table frustrated, while Jack kept hitting the table.Tears welled up in Eric\u2019s eyes.Tears gathered in the baby\u2019s eyes, too.Eric saw Jack crying in tears.Is he crying because he misses his mom or is he hungry?\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, you can eat\u2026\u2026.\u201dEric held up a spoon. It was Jack\u2019s favorite yogurt. Jack knew the sweetness of the white yogurt, but he didn\u2019t dare to open his mouth. He shook his head.Eric and Jack\u2019s second game was about to begin.-Ding dong!The alarm went off.Later, Eric told Maria that the notification sounded like a heavenly bell when she returned home from a 15-day business trip.Now, of course, it was a useless alarm.\u201cWhat?\u201dHe heard an alarm sound from the Pinepad on the table. It was a pinepad that Maria used before cooking or working at the table.Looking at the screen, an alarm was displayed that one of the channels on Youtube that Maria subscribed to had been updated.[LALA\u2019S DAY-The latest images have been updated.]It was a Youtuber that Maria sometimes referred to when making fusion dishes of Korean dishesEric agonized for a moment. Looking at the time, it was more than 50 minutes since he had a scuffle with his son.\u201cOkay, Jack. Son. A brief truce.\u201dEric raised his hands. Jack poked his lips out and said to himself, Abu Abu.He decided to watch a video to refresh himself for a while.\u201cThis Youtuber said that her daughter is eating well these days\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhat Maria said came to his mind.It was the same Youtuber who was trying various ways through comments and broadcasts to feed babies from the perspective of raising babies together.But these few days, Maria was jealous of the Youtuber\u2019s daughter, who said she ate very well.She bought powdered milk posted by Nutuber \u2013 sold only in Korea and barely arrived at their home by overseas delivery \u2013 and made baby food that she recommended, but it didn\u2019t work for Jack.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give me some tips on feeding my baby?\u201dEric pressed the start button. Unlike usual, there was no advertisement.\u201cWhat? Two minutes?\u201dIt was only a two-minute video. Eric, who was trying to take a breather for 30 minutes while watching the video, looked at the video with an ambiguous expression.[Hello! This is Lara LALA!]He thought it was a little weird, but Eric didn\u2019t stop the video.It was a stroke of luck.Eric thought again that he was very lucky that the alarm went off then. And he thought watching the video was the next best thing to do after marrying Maria and having Jack.[Today\u2019s video is short. I\u2019d like to recommend a YouTube channel.]LALA said with a serious face on a shaky screen, \u201cWas she recording with her hands?\u201d[My daughter is eating very well these days. You all know that, right?]Eric nodded his head.[Well, since I told you that, you would know it.]LALA, who stopped talking for a while, and opened her mouth.[Today I will be sharing the secret]\u201cWhat?\u201dEric was surprised. Secret?People around the world watching her video were also surprised.LALA bowed her head. It was a face full of sorry.[Actually, it\u2019s true that my daughter eats milk powder and baby food well. But that wasn\u2019t all about why my daughter became a good eater. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t tell you the truth in the meantime.]\u201cNo, what?\u201dAfter waiting hours for the new product to be stocked, the powdered milk that they had barely bought came to his mind. It was barely bought before it was sold out due to the small quantity already in stock.Also, the ingredients that they bought to make baby food were piled up in the refrigerator. Eric looked at the refrigerator with an embarrassing look on his face.LALA just said \u2018recommendation\u2019 and Eric doesn\u2019t believe the Youtuber 100 percent, but he feels like he\u2019s been swindled.Eric turned on the comment box to get to know other people\u2019s thoughts. There are already many comments.-No, it wasn\u2019t milk powder and baby food?--I bought that milk powder\u2026I\u2019ve had a hard time shipping it overseas. \u315c\u315c--I will give you more money\u2026\u2026.just tell me the secret-\u2013 LALA is just a recommendation.--I know. What you recommended might not suit other people\u2019s tastes. It\u2019s not LALA\u2019s fault.-But they say there was another secret.Everyone was disappointed because they hid it.Maybe it\u2019s something to do with privacy?There were no abusive comments because everyone was a fan of LALA, but many comments were saying they were disappointed and they blamed her.On the other hand, many comments were defending her.A fight seemed to break out.While reading the comments, LALA\u2019s voice was heard and subtitles were released. An arrow sign appeared at the top of the screen.[That\u2019s the secret of the image of the display on the screen.]Breaking version of \u201cBaby food. ver\u201d came up. He could watch it right away by clicking.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dEric, who was about to write a comment, paused and tilted his head. The title alone did not tell.LALA\u2019s video clip continued.[For a moment, this is a video that my friend posted. Originally, I was only going to watch it with my friends, but I managed to persuade them to upload it on YouTube.]He wondered what kind of video she even persuaded her friend.[This video should be watched by children rather than parents. So I let my daughter watch it. Set it up so that the baby can see it well and feed them baby food and milk powder. By doing so, they are going to eat very well.]Several photos of LALA\u2019s daughter eating while looking at her smartphone have been uploaded.Eric turned his head when he saw Jack still upset.[Baby Food and powdered milk were my personal recommendations, but the baby has to watch these videos. Really, it\u2019s a must! We\u2019ll be back with the next video soon! Hi, everyone!]At the end of the sentence, LALA\u2019s video ended. All that was left was a video recommended by LALA.Eric thought about it for a while and decided to do as she said.\u201cMaria, this is the last means I could think of.\u201dEric left the Pinepad in a good view of Jack and heated Jack\u2019s baby food.It was a dish made with a baby food recipe recommended by LALA.He thought that if it was the baby food she recommended, Jac would eat better while watching the video.\u201cIs it really working?\u201dHe had doubts, but seeing Jack who had not eaten for an hour, he had no choice but to try.Jack kept his mouth shut and Eric sighed.Baby food was placed in front of Jack. Eric sat next to Jack and decided to feed him while watching the video together.\u201cPlease eat\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe video has begun.A baby with black hair appeared on the screen. A baby younger than Jack, who looked less than a year old, was sitting in a baby chair.It was a cute-looking baby with chubby cheeks and distinct features. Then he heard a small sound. It was a man\u2019s voice.\u2018Are you? Jun?\u2019He saw the channel name.[JUN] It seemed to be the baby\u2019s name.The woman\u2019s hand came out and he saw a white baby food on the baby spoon she was holding.Eric also put baby food in Jack\u2019s spoon. And he peeked at his son.His son had a slightly relieved look and was watching the video.\u2018Oh!\u2019Eric held his breath for timing.The baby in the video, Jun\u2019s mouth opened and a spoon went in.Jun shook all his thrilling arms.Jack\u2019s eyes turned to a mysterious baby with sparkling hair ate baby food. Deliciously. Yum yum.Jack somehow wanted to copy him.\u201cAh! Ah!\u201dJack\u2019s mouth opened. Eric noticed. It\u2019s now!A spoon went into Jack\u2019s mouth. Jack swallowed well without spitting out.Eric\u2019s eyes got bigger.Oh, oh, oh, oh!He wanted to scream with joy, but he held it in. There is still a lot of baby food left.Eric\u2019s savior, Jun, shook his arms hard and ate baby food, and Jack also ate. No wonder Jack was excited, so he waved his arms.One spoonful, two spoonfuls. The bowl of food was quickly served after Jun.\u201cPapa! Papa!\u201dAfter eating all the baby food, Jack, who was full, hugged Eric, shouting \u201cPapa.\u201dEric seemed to have tears in his eyes.\u201cNo, this is not the time.\u201dEric quickly took out the Pinepad and wrote comments on Jun\u2019s video. He hurried up, pressed the Subscribe button and also the Recommendation button. The next time Jack fed time, he could play it comfortably.-He\u2019s done eating! It\u2019s really effective!--My daughter is done eating, too! I recommend it to babies who don\u2019t eat!--I had a squabble for an hour, but I couldn\u2019t feed him, but as soon as I saw the video, I ate it all! Jun! Thank you so much!-It was also included in the LALA video clip that showed Jun\u2019s video.Comments of disappointment written in the short two-minute video were gradually being deleted. It was not deleted by LALA. The parties who wrote the comments were voluntarily deleting them.-Thank you! Please tell your friend that it was very helpful!-\u2013 Thank you so much for persuading me! My son is eating really well!-This is my mom who left a comment earlier. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really\u2026\u2026thank you for uploading the video.-Ding ding!Eric, did you feed him?It was Maria.Eric quickly wrote the message with a bright face. I also sent a clean empty baby food bowl.It was for his wife to worry about her son who worked hard but didn\u2019t eat.<<Mission clear! I\u2019m done feeding him! :)>><<How did you do that? Awesome!>>Eric grinned. He was going to keep it a secret about Jun\u2019s video until Maria came home.He was going to brag about how well he fed her without her. Of course, he\u2019ll be caught as soon as she gets home.<<I\u2019ll do it! :)>>Like Eric Smith, more and more viewers were watching LALA\u2019S DAY and JUN\u2019s videos of eating baby food and milk powder. Comments and recommendations for the two videos have also increased.It\u2019s been 24 hours since the video was uploaded and the number of views on the video was approaching 1 million.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He slept very well without dreaming.Seojun, who was lying on a blocked baby bed and looking at colorful mobile dolls, did his own stretching by shaking his arms and legs.Then he bit his mouth on the side that his mother gave him, which was connected with his chubby wrist and a string.Other babies would have burst into tears as soon as they opened their eyes, but Seo-joon was different. He enjoyed himself in a leisurely way.[Elf\u2019s basic breathing]The presence of a line (light) makes Mana embrace.It does not conflict with other breathing methods. Except evil (dark)Harmonizes the body of the holder.Seojun breathed in and breath out.The world had Mana scarcity but it was still enough to meditate.Seojun learned [Elf\u2019s basic breathing] from the moment he started thinking, he learned it.He forget almost everything else when he was just a new born, but that was only for two months.He didn\u2019t forget [Elf\u2019s basic breathing] and [Main\u2019s basic breathing].[Main\u2019s Basic Breathing] has a similar effect to Elf\u2019s Basic Breathing, which has helped the existence of evil (dark) tendencies.Seojun chose one of the two tendencies to learn basic breathing methods when he had a certain understanding of the newly born \u201cbody.\u201dSeojun\u2019s breathing gradually subsided. As his breathe was repeated, very small amount of mana permeated Seojun\u2019s body.It was because of the advantage of Seojun using these two breathing methods as his first ability from many lives.The greatest advantages of [Elf\u2019s Basic Breathing] and [Main\u2019s Basic Breathing] are\u2026\u2026.\u201cOh, are you up already?\u201dHis father popped his face out onto the baby\u2019s bed.Seojun smiled at his father.\u2026\u2026it was safety. During the breathing method, he was able to finish it safely even when someone came into contact with or he suddenly stopped breathing.It was especially useful when you were born as a weak monster who could not even relax for a moment.\u201cIs Seojun up?\u201d\u201cYes, but why are we getting so many messages?\u201dSunday morning. His father, who didn\u2019t go to work, came out to the living room with Seojun in his arms.His Mom was opening her laptop on the living room table and looking at her smartphone.Maybe it\u2019s has her notification on, that was constantly ringing.\u201cAbuabu.\u201d\u201cSeojun said is noisy, too.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll turn it off.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye hurriedly turned off the alarm. Lee Min-joon sat next to Seo Eun-hye, while Seojun sat on his lap with his back against his father\u2019s stomach.\u201cBut what\u2019s the matter with the messages, and YouTube is the also messaging here?\u201d\u201cFirst, Minji and Soyoung\u2026\u2026I think all the people that knows Seojun are messaging\u201dSeo Eun-hye said as if she were sick of it. KakaoTalk messages poured out during the conversation.\u201cMinji wants me to go into YouTube. It\u2019s a complete mess.\u201dSeo Eun-hye, who barely read the message, logged in to YouTube. Lee Min-joon also pulled his head out and looked at the laptop screen. Seojun held back for now and looked at the screen.YouTube was where Seojun posted a video of using \u201cfairy glitter\u201d the other day.YouTube.A site where people from all over the world upload their own videos.In the news that Dad often plays, he also explained the past, present, and future of YouTubers.He didn\u2019t know very much details, but Seojun knew that there were people who became stars through YouTube, not celebrities.\u201cWow\u2026\u2026 what is this\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m scared\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon were surprised by the huge number of views and comments. Seojun also saw the numbers on the screen.\u2018That\u2019s incredible.\u2019They really didn\u2019t expect to see a lot of people. It has been less than 24 hours.Three people were admiring the monitor when the phone rang.It was the senior YouTuber and Mina\u2019s mom.Seo Eun-hye answered the phone quickly. It was because she was scared rather than happy with the number of views and comments beyond his imagination.\u201cOh, Minji! What\u2019s this? What\u2019s going on?\u201d-Did you see that? Really! Amazing!\u201cNo, really, is this real?\u201d-Yeah! You\u2019re such a star! Oh, no, no. Seojun! Seojun, Is a real star!-Mina\u2019s mother\u2019s loud voice rang in the living room. Lee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye could not take their eyes off the screen even though they heard Mina\u2019s mother\u2019s voice. Mina\u2019s mom hurried on.-Hurry up and apply for a profit!-\u201cSure, Profit?\u201d\u201cWait, honey.\u201dInstead of panicking Seo Eun-hye, Lee Min-joon answered the phone and changed it to speaker mode.\u201cHello, Mina\u2019s mother. This is Seojun\u2019s dad. But isn\u2019t there a condition?\u201dHe tried to calm down, but he was embarrassed because he immediately said the same thing.\u201cThey say it\u2019s hard to achieve in a day or two unless you\u2019re famous.\u201dOften, Kim Hee-sung\u2019s doll making was posted on YouTube and talked about the conditions of applying for profit generation.-Oh, hello! It\u2019s okay! Seojun\u2019s channel has already achieved it, moreover it\u2019s way over the limit!-\u201cIs that so?\u201d-Yes! I\u2019m watching it and watching the number of subscribers, Seojun\u2019s channel went trending in the evening!-Seo Eun-hye with a surprised expression pointed her finger at the number of subscribers on one side of the screen. Lee Min-joon, who was on the phone with Mina\u2019s mother, looked that way.200,000 subscribers.Lee Min-joon also opened his mouth. Seojun was worried.\u2018I am hungry. Should I cry or not?\u2019However, the condition of the mother and father was unusual to cry now.-200,000 like! 200,000 likes!--But it\u2019s still going up!-Mina\u2019s mother continued. Mom and dad\u2019s facial expressions showed no sign of change. Seojun decided to cry because he felt like his belly was going to stick to his back.\u201cArgh! Argh! Argh!\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026surprise!\u201dIn Seojun\u2019s crying, Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon barely came to their senses. Lee Min-joon grabbed Seojun and jumped up and headed to the kitchen.\u201cWell, yeah, let\u2019s eat. My son. You\u2019re going to eat!\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026Uh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI need to speak to Minji!\u201dSeo Eun-Hye talked to Mina\u2019s mom on the phone and applied for the channel\u2019s revenue generation.Lee Min-joon poured warm water into the bottle and burned powdered milk. Seojun, who quickly stopped crying, waited for powdered milk in Lee Min-joon\u2019s arms.\u201cWow\u2026 really\u2026What\u2019s going on?\u201dDad mumbled to himself in a state of rapture, but rode the powdered milk very naturally. He was such a father!After checking the temperature of powdered milk, the nipples entered Seojun\u2019s mouth.Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze!Lee Min-joon quickly hugged Seojun and headed back to the living room. Seo Eun-hye hung up and was reading comments on Seojun\u2019s video.\u201cDid you sign up?\u201d\u201cYes, they\u2019ll run ads as soon as they get permission.\u201d\u201cBut what happened?\u201dSeo Eun-hye, an academy teacher who teaches Korean to foreign students, slowly read the comments. There were many languages, but she mostly read comments in English and Korean.\u201cEveryone\u2026 My kid didn\u2019t eat, but he could eat after watching this video. If he eat three times a day, it takes about 30 minutes to Eat just one meal, but if he watch Seojun\u2019s video, he\u2019ll eat right away.\u2026.\u201dAs Lee Min-joon leaned to see the screen, Seojun, who was eating powdered milk deliciously, became uncomfortable. He couldn\u2019t make a sound because he was biting the nipples so slapped Lee Min-jun\u2019s arm with one hand.\u201cOh, sorry, sorry.\u201dLee Min-joon took a proper posture again and looked at the screen. Seojun also looked sideways at the screen.He watch TV with his dad and read picture books and fairy tales, so he can read some Korean\u2026\u2026. However, the comments were more in English and other languages.Still, he tried to read Hangul in his spare time, but his mom and dad read the comments too fast.\u2018Oh, my eyes hurt.\u2019Seojun, who blinked a few times, decided to close his eyes and focus on powdered milk.Squeeze! Squeeze!Lee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye are obsessed with reading comments. They saw comments saying thank you and recommending it to my friends.Kakaotalk! Kakaotalk!It was Seo Eun-hye\u2019s phone. It was the twin\u2019s mother who sent the message.While Seo Eun-hye was reading the message, Seojun drank all the milk powder and dropped the bottle on the floor as if he were letting go. The bottle is heavy.\u201cOh, my gosh.\u201dJust in time, my father, who escaped from the comment hell, quickly caught the bottle.\u201cHey, when you\u2019re done, call dad!\u201d\u201cAbu-Abu-Abu-Abu-Boo!\u201cYes, that\u2019s what you call it! What if I drop it?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want from an eight-month-old baby?\u201dIn Lee Min-joon\u2019s words, Eun-hye said absurdly. Lee Min-joon smiled and patted Seojun on the back.\u201cOur Seojn is a genius, so he can understand everything.\u201d\u201cEvery parent thinks his or her child is a genius.\u201d\u201cOur Seojun is a real genius.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dWhile spilling out his father\u2019s words in one ear, Seo Eun-hye opened the link sent by the twin\u2019s mother.It was a knight.It was a small Internet article, but it was obvious to everyone.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLee Min-joon also saw the article. Neither of them spoke out. The two men, who were only open-mouthed, barely spoke out.\u201cWow, I thought my heart was stopping.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on today\u2026\u2026.\u201dSince then, posts or links to articles written about Seojun\u2019s videos have been sent to Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon\u2019s KakaoTalk from people who know Seojun, regardless of if it was a friend or not.<<Hey! Isn\u2019t this Seojun\u2019s video that you showed us last time?>><<Crazy! Wow! Really!!!>>Kim Hee-sung, who was not even married, even shared Seojun\u2019s video.[Title: I recommend it!

And the result came out.Posts began to be posted on sites unrelated to babies under the title [Effective, Amazing Baby Eating Show Up to 20 Months!].Seojun\u2019s videos were captured, and photos of babies eating while looking at Mom Cafe\u2019s comments and smartphones were posted, as proof shots.-Wow.

Just a week ago, she was happy to receive a bonus, but she never thought she\u2019d have to work during the weekends, let alone thinking about her bonus.\u201cNo way, I am going to get fired\u2026this won\u2019t work, will it?\u201dShe has been lucky these past few days.Two instant lottery tickets, which she bought happily after work on Friday, were winning tickets. Work went well, and the clothes she bought online fit perfectly. The late delivery food has been hot for almost 15 minutes, and it was delicious enough to make her think of becoming a regular customer.She slept well without dreaming, she get up quickly, finish cleaning the house neatly, and watch a movie that she thought was fun.\u2026Swish-Swosh-It was windy. It was the start of the storm.She put on an arrogant face on a KakaoTalk message that Kang So-ra, the head of the marketing team, sent in a hurry, wondering if she could work until the weekend.\u2026.She didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing.<<Hyunji, we\u2019re in trouble \u3160>><<Why? What\u2019s going on?>><<You know LALA, which we were supposed to cast for that commercial! She uploaded a video clip of youtube!>>LALA has been the biggest contributor to Elephant series sales in recent weeks. One of the Elephant series was powdered milk for LALA\u2019s daughter.She recommended the Elephant series on video, allowing her company, a small powdered milk company, to sell out all week.Not only in Korea, but also in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia, parents who were watching LALA videos seemed to buy at least one.From shopping malls that deliver overseas to domestic marts, there have been a flood of orders saying they are sold out and that they want to increase their orders.\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to increased the production.\u2026.\u201dAs soon as she knew the reason for the milk powder sale, she thought it would sell well for at least three months and suggested it. So she was operating the factory 24 hours a day but that was a mistake.\u201cFirst of all, Mina likes Elephant powdered milk the most. They all use organic and healthy ingredients.\u201d\u201cOur Jiyoon is an Elephant powdered milk. Other powdered milk doesn\u2019t work well.\u201d\u201cEven the twins like Elephant. I tried feeding it because it was too good, and it was good to have the bowel movement.\u201dLooking at the proposal that the mothers flew in, they commented on this and that and that. Seo Eun-Hye shook her head.\u201cNo. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to advertise..\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long time process. Make a lot of money and give it to Seojun in the future.\u201dMina\u2019s mother, who has been invited to Internet ads several times, looked at the proposals with her eyes on.\u201cFor now, don\u2019t accept milk powder that has a bad reputation among mothers.\u201d\u201cYes, Seojun has an image to uphold.\u201dThe twin\u2019s mother helped out.\u201cFiltrate out the brand with a bad corporate image.\u201d\u201cThen, here. Except here.\u201d\u201cYou should choose powdered milk that Seojun can eat well rather than thinking about money. If the baby\u2019s image gets distorted, he won\u2019t come out on the screen. He has to eat well and take good video at once, so Seojun doesn\u2019t have a hard time.\u201dMina\u2019s mom shook her head. This was because she remembered the scene of a commercial where a five-year-old child drank milk over and over again.Seo Eun-hye has already picked out several pages and added a smile to her grateful friends who help her.\u201cSeojun likes Elephant powdered milk. He eat it if I don\u2019t have any milk, but if I fed him other milk powder, he doesn\u2019t seem to like it.\u201dSeo Eun-hye smiled quietly as she recalled Seojun pointing at the milk powder bottle with a yellow elephant on it with his fingers.\u201cReally?\u201dJiyoon\u2019s mother looked surprised.\u201cNo, did he like Elephants that much?\u201dShe was feeding her twins with another brand of powdered milk. Everyone close to her feeds their children with Elephant milk powder, so should she change her?Come to think of it, Elephant milk powder is a smaller company than other companies, so she have never fed it to Jiyoon because she have no faith in it.Mina\u2019s mom nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s great. The boss there was a baby\u2019s mother, and she had a hard time because she didn\u2019t have any milk powder for the baby. Since then, dhe\u2019s been trying to make healthy and good milk powder.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about the company, but I think the ingredients are similar to other powdered milk, but they\u2019re a lot to consider such as the price. Considering the amount of twins eating\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe mother of twins held her forehead. Seo Eun-hye also told.\u201cI bought powdered milk recommended by the Mom Cafe and fed it to Seojun. His favorite was Elephant powdered milk.\u201d\u201cI see. Want me to feed you?\u201dWord of mouth has already worked. Mina\u2019s mother laughed at the sight.\u201cNo, it\u2019s already been advertised!\u201d\u201cYeah. Won\u2019t Seojun sell it out at this rate?\u201d\u201cThen shall we go with Elephant?\u201dSeo Eun-hye said. Contrary to her concerns, the decision was quick. As Mina\u2019s mom said, this trend was also in season. Even if it was in the advertisement, unlike the product, the model was quickly forgotten.In addition, it was a powdered milk that Seojun liked, even if it was Elephant. She thought this would be a good memory.\u201cIt\u2019s better if we make money and help Seojun.\u201d\u201cWhat about Seojun\u2019s dad?\u201d\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019ve got an ad offer\u2026\u2026I\u2019m still thinking about whether to do it or not.\u201d\u201cThen, ask Seojun\u2019s dad later. A couple should do this together. It\u2019s a baby\u2019s business, and if only one of the parents decides, it\u2019s going to be crazy.Mina\u2019s mother, who is watching YouTube with Mina\u2019s father, he said his active approval.\u201cOkay.\u201dSeo Eun-hye also agreed with her.And that evening, with Dad\u2019s big approval, the future superstar Seojun\u2019s first commercial shoot was decided.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNow another Seojun\u2019s adventure will start!***Seojun and his mom were looking at the laptop. The screen was still scrolling fast, so Seojun couldn\u2019t read any of the words, but fortunately Seo Eun-hye was reading it for Seojun one by one.Seo Eun-hye didn\u2019t think Seojun would understand it. However, it was an enjoyable moment to talk read comments to Seojun as they were proper words of encouragement.\u201cWow. It doesn\u2019t work after 20 months.\u201dAlthough she was the one who filmed the video, the Internet has full of stories about the video that Seo Eun-hye did not know. In particular, she was surprised by the post that made a reasearch to which months did and didn\u2019t work.\u201cAbububu!\u201d\u2018Maybe it was because [fairy\u2019s glitter] that I used is the lowest level of ability.\u2019He had quite the ability to imitate the skill, but he needed a corresponding mana. Seojun, who is only eight months old, this was too much to use.\u201cA lot of other babies\u2019 mukbangs, too?\u201dThat\u2019s what fashion was like. Everyone copied when someone started to become successful.Unlike Seojun\u2019s video, however, other babies\u2019 eating shows did not work. They ate it once or twice as a coincidence, but by the second day it was clear.\u201cEveryone says they will only watch Seojun\u2019s videos. Seojun is so amazing!\u201dSeojun\u2019s shoulders were flattered by his mother\u2019s praise.Seo Eun-hye looked up after surfing the Internet for some time. The clock has already passed ten o\u2019clock. Lee Min-joon, who should be back at 7 o\u2019clock, is late.\u201cDaddy\u2019s late.\u201dToday, Lee Min-joon left the company earlier to talk about the CF contract with Elephant. And he decided to meet his friend who is a lawyer after receiving the contract.\u201cWhile meeting your dad\u2019s friend, they must be drinking.\u201d\u201cBoo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo-boo\u201dSeojun fell down on the teddy bear next to him. It\u2019s already 10 o\u2019clock. He fell asleepSeo Eun-hye hugged Seojun. Patting on his back quickly made his eyes heavy. Seoju\u2019s eyelids slowly went down.Ding dong.The timing was not good.Tuck-Then the door opened. Seojun opened his eyes at the sound, while Seo Eun-hye swallowed a sigh.\u201cDaddy\u2019s here!\u201d said Dad, whose face was red.Seo Eun-hye shook her hands when she saw Lee Min-joon stretching his arms to hug Seojun.\u201cWash up first.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026okay.\u201dLee Min-joon, who quickly washed up, sat face to face with Seo Eun-hye. Maybe he didn\u2019t drink much so his eyes seemed fine. When Seojun woke up, he played with the teddy bear next to the couple.Lee Min-joon took out the contract. It was a copy, not an original.Difficult words or words were marked with red pens and annotated below. Lee Min-joon explained the contract according to what he heard from the team leader and his lawyer friend.\u201cSo the filming starts when Seojun eats, this will be shot for about 30 minutes, and if he needs more, he needs to shoot more on the same day. Of course, after Seojun\u2019s digestion is complete.\u201dIf they look at Seojun\u2019s eating time, they would have to wait for two to three hours after filming at least once they had to film again.\u201cSeojun will be comfortable, but others have to wait that long. That means we have to finish it at once as much as possible.\u2026. Is it possible to shoot in 30 minutes?\u201d\u201cI heard that it only needs to come out like a video posted on YouTube. It can be corrected, subtitled, or narrated.\u201dSeo Eun-hye nodded with relief at Lee Min-joon\u2019s words. The YouTube video was just a random video taken and uploaded without re-shooting.\u201cThey said they would make the background as similar as possible to places Seojun can eat comfortably and send it to me.\u201d Lee Min-joon continued.\u201cWow, do they care that much? It\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cI heard it\u2019s going to go up to some kind of YouTube commercial and then it\u2019s going to be on TV. For about three months.\u201dThey cared much better for her son than she thought. She was worried that Seojun would have a hard time, but she thought it would be okay if they paid this much attention.\u201cI think it\u2019s great. What about him?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no toxin on theclause so it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cThen shall we advertise?\u201dLee Min-joon nodded at Seo Eun-hye\u2019s question. Seojun also nodded. Mom and dad laughed when they happened to see it.\u201cSeojun said good, too.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s decide!\u201dLee Min-joon came to find a black pen. Then he took out the original contract.\u201cYou can sign here.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSeo Eun-hye wrote her name and Lee Min-joon wrote his name also. Seo Eun-hye, who was thinking for a while, brought red paint from Seojun\u2019s toy warehouse and couple\u2019s closet.\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cIt is Seojun\u2019s commercial, so we need his signture. It\u2019s a paint made of natural ingredients. I bought it on sale in advance to have Seojun play with it when he gets litter bigger. Seojun can\u2019t sign, so I\u2019ll take his fingertips.\u201dSeo Eun-hye took a small bowl from the kitchen and removed some red paint. Then she put Seojun on her lap.Seo Eun-hye took Seojun\u2019s right thumb with the paint.\u201cWait, wait, wait! Let\u2019s take a picture to celebrate our first contract!\u201dLee Min-joon quickly brought out a camera and clicked. He filmed a video to avoid it being blurry. Seo Eun-hye stamped the baby\u2019s thumb under the couple\u2019s signature.The CF contract was stamped red with the signature of the father and mother and the baby\u2019s thumb.* * *Seojun opened his eyes. He felt like he fell asleep before he knew it. When he opened his eyes wide and looked at his palm, there was still redness in his thumb.Recalling his mother\u2019s words that it would be gone tomorrow, Seojun clenched his fist and unfolded it.Seojun, who was only looking at his hands, raised his head. There was a blue door in front of him. It was the very door only he could open.\u201cIs this still the only place?\u201dSeojun swung his hand to the right. A door bigger than a blue door appeared. Even if he pressed the door with his palm, the tightly closed door wouldn\u2019t open. He waved his hand again and opened the blue door.Seojun crawled slowly through the door.\u201cDid I read this many books?\u201dUnorganized, books that couldn\u2019t fit on the shelves were scattered on the floor.\u201cWell, should I make an automatic cleaning spell?\u201dHe tilted his head, but he thought it would not be a bad idea to indicate how far he had read in this way.Besides, it was hard to do anything with this baby body now.Seojun took out the book and started reading it after reading the previous books.\u201cWell, is there anything good?\u201d\u2018What do I need to do for the commercial shoot?\u2019[Fairy Glitter-Lowest] worked well, but only for babies up to 20 months old.Unlike his mukbang show that only need to work on babies, Elephant powdered milk ads had to appeal to parents for purchasing power.\u201cTo adults\u2026 Well\u2026\u2026 what could it be\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeojun read the book diligently and went down.Books containing many lives were read in an instant.Surely there was a difference between the body of reality and his body inside of the library. Unlike his real baby\u2019s body, in the library he was able to read letters quickly, and he was comfortable to move hands and body.But if he keep reading the letters, his eyes will still hurt the same.\u201cOh, my eyes.\u201dSeojun, who had been resting for a while with a small palm or two because his eyes hurt, thought.Suddenly, he thought of the doll of Lich King that his uncle gave him.\u201cWith Lich\u2019s hypnotic magic, it would be really comfortable\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe knew it would work through the video, so even a sold-out was not a dream using a single hypnotic magic.Unfortunately, however, the memory of life as big as a Lich he had to walk through a very, very large door. Seojun, as he stands now, he couldn\u2019t even open it.\u201cBesides, Lich\u2019s magic is only evil (dark)\u2026\u2026 is that too much\u2026\u201dSeojun, who is learning the E.L.F.\u2019s basic breathing, gave up early on, and read the book again.\u201cThis, I think I\u2019ll read all night\u2026\u2026phew\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t find the right ability.It seemed like a lot of time had passed.Seojun thought hard. Why don\u2019t he just give up and rest? Shall he look for a little more?At that time, a book came into Seojun\u2019s eyes. As he read the title as if he was passing by, the faded memory permeated into Seojun\u2019s head.\u2018What?\u2019\u201cWas this here?\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes shook. Seojun quickly opened the book and read it. Reading the book made him feel much closer to life at that time.\u201cThis would be great!\u201dSeojun smiled brightly as he had found the ability he liked.* * *\u201cHello!\u201dTeam leader Choi Hyun-ji quickly ran to greet him. Seo Eun-hye, who was picking up Seojun from the car seat, also greeted her with pleasure. Lee Min-joon took Seojun\u2019s bag in the passenger seat.\u201cThis is Choi Hyun-ji, the head of the Elephant planning team.\u201d\u201cYes, hello. I\u2019m Seo Eun-hye, Seojun\u2019s mom.\u201dChoi Hyun-ji led her family to the set.\u201cThere\u2019s some time left until the shoot, but you\u2019re here quickly!\u201d\u201cI think Seojun needs to get used to the unfamiliar filming site to film well.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019ll thank you!\u201dThe filming site was open and spacious, one side was decorated like a living room in a family house and one side with cameras and lights.People who looked like staff were moving furniture into the living room and repositioning the lights.Seo Eun-Hye, who was watching this scene the first time, saw the living room set of the family house. Seo Eun-hye admired it.\u201cThat\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d\u201cYes, wr decorated it as similar as we could.\u201dSeojun also looks at the living room decorated almost like his house.He spit out some sound.\u201cThis is the waiting room. If Seojun is uncomfortable, please come in and rest comfortably.\u201dWhen she opened the door, there was a room decorated with a warm feeling.Dolls that babies would love, small cribs, mobile on top. A coffee pot on the other hand, an Elephant powdered milk with a yellow elephant on it, and a bottle sterilizer. Even diapers from various brands.In addition, Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon thought they were so well prepared that they could eat sandwiches, coffee sticks, and snacks.\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cYes, you can always look around the set. Or you can rest here until the shooting time. The director hasn\u2019t come yet\u2026\u2026. Oh, there are many wires under your feet when you look around the set, so please be careful. You might touch some dangerous objects, so hold Seojun tight.\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon nodded at Choi Hyun-ji\u2019s words. Choi Hyun-ji left the waiting room to prepare for the shooting.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect them to prepare like this.\u201d Lee Min-joon said as he unpacked Seojun\u2019s bag.\u201cI know. But these dolls are so cute.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye, who hugged Seo Joon, admired the dolls gathered on one side.Fluffy and yellow chick dolls, panda dolls with big eyes, and sparrow dolls huddled together. It was a far cry from the dolls in the house.Lee Min-joon laughed half as if he had resigned. In his hand was the only ordinary teddy bear in the house, taken out from his bag.\u201cSeojun won\u2019t like it.\u201dThe mother heard her husband word so she look at her son. Seojun was not interested in the doll in front of him. He stretched his arms looking at the teddy bear that his father took out. Lee Min-joon gave Seojun the teddy bear.Too much to hold on to, Seojun was put in a prepared crib with the teddy bear.Uncle\u2019s doll is the best doll ever!Seojun, who was fiddling the teddy bear\u2019s belly which looked like his doppelganger, looked down at his own belly with a meaningful look, which contained the lethal weapon for advertising found in the library of life.\u2018Huh? My head keeps going down\u2026\u2026?\u2019Unable to bear the weight of his head, Seojun stuck his forehead in the belly of the teddy bear in front of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNote: Don\u2019t be confused about this chapter. I guarantee that this is still from the same novel.\u201cGrandpa! Tell the story about the Hero!\u201dLittle children rushed in. The old man sitting in front of the fountain in the village plaza laughed. The old man was the village chief\u2019s grandfather and the oldest living man in the village.\u201cWhat, what story?\u201dThe old man put his finger in his ear and asked back. The problem was that the old man, who was very wise, good, kind, and smart, had bad ears.Among the little kids, the leader shouted loudly again.\u201cTell! The! Story! Of! The! Hero!\u201d\u201cAh, the story of the hero?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dLittle children huddled together in front of the old man. The old man was not only smart but also talented in making stories very interesting.\u201cThat\u2019s an old story.\u201d\u201cGrandpa, you\u2019ve lived a long time! My mom said you might be a wizard!\u201dIt was just what the old man went through the day before yesterday, but the children knew how old he was.The old man continued to talk about whether he didn\u2019t hear or he was pretending not to hear.\u201cWhen I was a little younger than you, the village was very peaceful. Monster never appears and so the town was peaceful for many years.\u201dThe old man was lost in his old memories.\u201cWhen I went out to play in the woods nearby, there was a small wooden box under the tree. I brought it down to town quickly because it was so pretty.\u201d\u201cThe villagers also looked around, saying it was a very pretty and amazing box. But the lid of the box suddenly opened.\u201d\u201cIt was a Monster, Mimic.\u201d\u201cBut the villagers didn\u2019t know what it really was. The box with the lid open had small teeth, a small tongue size, and two round eyes attached to the lid. What do people think this was? That\u2019s what I thought about it. Then he heard a growling sound from the wooden box. I quickly went and get my snack and gave it to the box.\u201d\u201cSince then, the wooden box has lived in a village under the name of Mimic.\u201d\u201cAt first, the villagers gave food what people usually ate, but soon they gave food that they couldn\u2019t eat to Mimic instead of burying it in the ground. However, Mimic still ate them very deliciously.\u201d\u201cSometimes when Mimic pretended to be a box, and I wanted to open it. I was curious and wanted to see what was in the box.\u201d\u201cBut it was actually Mimic!\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s always been Mimic when I opened the lid. Also, there are times he pretends to be a birthday present. It was a very funny joke.\u201dThe old man laughed very pleasantly. Then he lowered his voice low.\u201cAnd a few years later. A very scary monster appeared.\u201dThe old man still couldn\u2019t dare to say the name of the monster. Now the only person alive who went through it was the old man.The old man was very terrified remembering it. The monster was clearly high-level.Why such a fearsome monster appeared in such a small town, he didn\u2019t know, as he was just an old villager man.The Heri who chased the monster with the holy sword was covered in blood. The great hero could not beat the monster either.Fortunately, at dawn, the village people hid within the darkness and the warrior was treated by the villagers.\u201cWhat kind of monster was that? Orcs? Trolls?\u201d\u201cWerewolf!\u201d\u201cWell, it was a horrible monster.\u201dThe old man could not identify the monster after so long. He didn\u2019t open his mouth just in case he would be caught by the children listening.The children were curious but eventually gave up.\u201cThe Hero said, Help me, I need to get rid of the monster right now.\u201dThat\u2019s what the Hero said, but what can a villager possibly do?All the villagers could do was cure him.It was then.\u201cMimic! Mimic!\u201d\u201cMimic, this was a Mimic.\u201d The surprised Hero shouted.\u201cMimic? What\u2019s wrong with Mimic?\u201dThe villagers tilted their heads. For them, Mimic was just a wooden box, a food waste disposal. The Hero who took out the Holy Sword explained.\u201cThat\u2019s a monster. Monster such them lived only in the depths! But how can you be friendly with it?!\u201d\u201cNo, Mimic is very nice!\u201dThe young version of the old man quickly hugged mimic within his arms. The Hero shouted.\u201cHurry up and put it down! It\u2019s a very dangerous monster!\u2019\u201cNo, Mimic! Mimic is very nice!\u201dThe villagers, who were looking at the Hero and the child\u2019s scuffle, blocked the child\u2019s front. The chief at the time, the old man\u2019s grandfather said.\u201cHero, it\u2019s not this child that matters now.\u201dThe Hero, who was frowning at the chief\u2019s words, sighed.\u201cI see, I see.\u201dThe Hero who put the Holy Sword back in nodded. Mimic could be handle at any time. Now the monster was the problem.At that time, Mimic, who ran out from the child\u2019s arms, jumped in front of the Hero.Mimic! Mimic!\u2018\u2026\u2026what is it?\u2019Mimic closed the lid and turned it into a wooden box.The blunt Hero felt that defeating the monster was the reason for his life.Why is it so pretty?The small box was very shiny.What\u2019s inside, what\u2019s in this beautiful box? He was curious. He wanted to open it.The Hero, who was looking at the box, reached for the box.\u201cDear Hero!\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026!?\u2019The Hero came to his senses at the call of the chief. The Her was on the verge of dying. With trembling fingers, he pointed at Mimic.\u201cWhat the hell is that!\u201dHe destroyed many dungeons and eliminated all kinds of monsters\u2026\u2026. No one has ever seduced the Hero this much.As if he knew what was on the Heri\u2019s mind, Mimic opened the lid, closed it, and shivered.\u201cMimic! Mimic!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Mimic?\u201d\u201cYeah, he\u2019s usually a good guy\u2026\u2026.\u201dMimic jumped up and down and turned into a box in front of the Hero again.The Heri was fully aware of the seduction skill of Mimic\u2026but still he had no choice but to be beaten. The Hero who was tempted three times like that realized.\u2018Yes, this Mimic\u2026\u2026.\u2019The Hero said to the villagers.\u201cLet\u2019s use Mimic to seduce monsters. And while the monster looked away, the warrior decided to take it away.\u201d\u201cMimic is in danger!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m scared of monsters!\u201dThey knew what would happen next, but the kids still screamed as if it was the first time they heard it. People passing by smiled as they saw the children.There were many times that they were like that.\u201cThe villagers also love Mimic so much that they said no to the plan. But the brave Mimmi sided with the Hero.\u201dEventually, the villagers left Mimic in the hands of the Hero.The Hero put the small box on the table and said.\u2018\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know if you can understand me. But I think this is why you came to me. I\u2019ll bring the Monster here. Then I want you to use your skill enough to seduce the Monster. In the meantime, I will destroy the Monster.\u2019The hero hesitated a little and continued.\u2018So that you\u2019re not in danger\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll get it over with it immediately. Be careful, too.\u2019\u201cMimic!\u201dWhen the sun went down, the Hero lured the hidden monster. There was a Mimic on the town\u2019s center table. Then the monster chasing after the hero saw Mimic.\u201cMimic be careful!\u201dThe plans of the hero and Mimic were not wrong.\u201cOh, what is this?\u2019The High-level monster was mesmerized and watched Mimic. He had never seen a box like this in hundreds of years. It was a box that he wanted to open right away and see what was inside. He wanted the stuff hidden inside the box.\u201cAhahaha, these worms are offering me this treasure! All right, I\u2019ll kill you guys very comfortably.\u201dThe monster shouted.People trembled inside their houses. It was more terrifying than they thought.The monster held the box with both hands. He opened the box very carefully with his big sharp hand.Then\u2026Something popped up from the chest. It was the white holy sword. There was a crack in the core of the monster and there was something shining in the center of the chest.\u201cDie, Monster!\u201dThe hero gave powers to the Holy Sword.Bajik.\u2014!The gold light became clear.The monster head turned back. The sharp eyes of the monster met the eyes of the warrior.\u2018I\u2026 oh, my\u2026\u2026was it a trap?\u2026.\u2019Feeling blurred, the monster straightened his head again. He saw a box in his hand.\u2018This is\u2026.\u2019The monster wanted what was in the box as he was dying. He knew it was a trap, but he wondered. \u201cWhat on earth did they put in that he was so tempted to know?\u201dThe Monster put his remaining strength to his hands. The box doesn\u2019t matter. The contents inside were important.\u201cBye! Bye!\u201d\u201cMimic!\u201dMimic. It was a Mimic. The monster smiled in vain as he watched Mimic screaming in pain.It\u2019s just a Mimic. Low level no, a trash monster who couldn\u2019t even rival a knight, seduced him. The Monster felt shame.\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you!\u201dThe hero lifted the Holy Sword up. The monster\u2019s head was split in half.The Monster\u2019s hands were weak and Mimic fell to the ground.Before he knew it, the young (Kid version of the current old man) who came out from the house ran quickly and received the falling Mimic.\u201cMimic!\u201dThe villagers came out quickly, too.Mimic\u2019s body was ragged. He thought it would break right away if he touched it wrong.The villagers shed tears regardless of child and adult.The hero, who completely dealt with the Monster, walked in and knelt on one knee in front of Mimic, who was currently being held by the young old man.Mimic\u2019s eyes turned on the hero. The hero nodded at his low cry.\u2018Mimic-mimic\u2026\u2019The monster was now completely gone. Not only did the hero kill it himself, but he also burned himself to the ground without leaving ashes behind him.Mimic\u2019s lid rattled. The warrior and the villagers thought it was Mimic smiling.The young old man who first met Mining and brought him to the village kept crying.\u2018Well done, the villagers are safe. Thanks to you, I was able to deal with the Monster. Thank you.\u2019\u2018Mimic\u2026\u2019The hero knew that, unlike other monsters, this little monster was special.In the hero\u2019s lifetime, this good monster was the first and last time this kind of Mimic would have been.The sound of Mimic\u2019s breathing subsided. Something rolled out through the gap of the dead body of Mimic.The child who saw it burst into tears. It was around a little stone that the child gave to Mimic as a gift.\u201cThat\u2019s how Mimic died at the hands of the monster. The hero and the villagers created fountains and statues to express gratitude where Mimic\u2019s dead body was placed.\u201d\u201cThank you, Mimic!\u201d\u201cI feel sorry for Mimic!\u201dThe children sobbed. The old man smiled when he remembered his best friend he had lost a long time ago.Behind the old man, there was a statue on the fountain spouting water beautifully.It was a statue of Mimic smiling brightly with the wooden lid open.The small town has grown ever since. This was because the Hero defeated the devil and settled in this village.The hero was given a title and received a large piece of land that included this village. Even after that, he ruled the territory very peacefully.\u201cIt\u2019s Elizabeth!\u201dThe children jumped up and ran toward the wagon with wooden box-shaped patterns on it.They were going to see Elizabeth, the hero\u2019s great-granddaughter.The window of the carriage opened and the little girl poked out her face.The old man, who recalled the face of a hero from the girl\u2019s face, laughed in vain.Then someone came up to the side of the old man and sat down.\u201cLong time no see.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYou always come. Every year today.\u201dThe gray-haired middle-aged man smiled softly. When he came to this town and reached this place, he was relieved without realizing it.\u201cToday, isn\u2019t it the day that Mimic died?\u201dThe middle-aged man, the hero, saw the old man. The small child before is already this old.The hero, who grows very slowly due to the power of God, wanders from place to place, hiding his identity, but still, he came to this town every year this day.\u201cI see. It\u2019s already that time. Now that I\u2019m older, I don\u2019t know how the day goes.\u201dThe old man laughed. The hero\u2019s eyes turned to his great-granddaughter\u2019s carriage. He was proud to see the pattern of the wooden box.\u2018The king asked, What do you want to do with the pattern?\u2019The hero said. \u2018I\u2019d like a wooden box.\u2019Since then, when it was impossible to say that it was symbolizing Mimic, wooden boxes wrapped in laurels became the signature of the hero.\u201cHe was a very special guy.\u201d\u201cYes, he was a very nice and a good friend.\u201dThe hero looked at the sky. The blue sky made him feel better.\u201cGod must have given him his next life, what do you think he\u2019s doing by now?\u201d\u201cI see. In his next life\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe old man grinned.\u201cHe is seducing other people, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201dThe hero laughed as he recalled Mimic, with who he had a short meeting but have a precious relationship.* * *Mimic, who has seduced both the hero and the monster, is now preparing to seduce his next target!\u201cSeojun will prepare for the shoot!\u201dSeojun clenched his hands tightly and vowed to sell the boxes out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can Seojun eat now?\u201dKang So-ra, who introduced herself as the marketing team leader, asked. Seo Eun-hye, who stood next to the crib, carried Seojun while looking at the clock.\u201cYes, he needs to eat in about ten minutes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. Shall we wait on the set?\u201dSeo Eun-hye held Seojun and Lee Min-joon held a teddy bear.When they came out of the waiting room along with team leader Kang So-ra, they saw the living room being built completely.It was similar to the living room of their house, but it has a warmer and more cozy atmosphere.\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dA man walked from far away. The soft chin seemed awkward, and he kept touching it with his hands. The team leader Kang So-ra introduced the man.\u201cHe is the director who\u2019s going to film a commercial today.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cHello.\u201dDirector Choi Dae-man, with a deep voice, bowed and made eye contact with Seojun. He cut off his beard, which was long and shaggy just to shoot this short ad.Seojun also made eye contact with the man in front of him.Looking at his clean, clear eyes, he seemed to be a good man.Seojun made some friendly baby sounds.\u201cThat\u2019s nice, the baby seemed not to be shy from you.\u201dChoi Dae-man, who looked pretty tough, was the type to be hated by kids. They cried their eyes out whenever he got close. He doesn\u2019t hate children, but he was used to be reluctant to get close to them everytime they cried like that.Fortunately, Seojun smiled very brightly, rather than being shy.\u201cWe\u2019re ready for the shoot. He can always eat at anytime. We will use one camera in front, two cameras at the right, one in the back, one at the top, a total of 5 cameras. We will try to shoot good scenes.\u201dDirector Choi Dae-man talked about the filming settings.\u201cFirst, I\u2019m going to film Seojun drinking the powdered milk. And when he is done, he is going to hug the Elephant powdered milk box like it is a doll and smile brightly.\u201dSeo Eun-hye thought for a moment. It was okay for him to drink the powdered milk.But hugging the Elephant bix, plus a bright smile\u2026\u2026.\u201cSeojun is smart, but I don\u2019t think he can do it at once.\u2026. Is it okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m sure they prepared well.\u201dThe staff on the set sighed inside. That\u2019s the case with filming centered on children. Moreover, it was a complete baby that neither mother nor father could order around.All of them are ready to shoot for a very long time. In order to not miss any good shots.\u201cAt his age\u2026\u2026. Can\u2019t he carry the bottle alone yet, can he?\u201d\u201cYes. He can hold the bottle himself because it usually happens between seven or eight months baby.\u201d\u201cWow, is that so? I originally thought that someone would help him up but if he can carry it alone, that would be fine. He might be uncomfortable with unfamiliar things.\u201d\u201cThen, the baby chair\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHere you go!\u201dKang So-ra, who ran to the waiting room, brought a soft baby sofa which was tilted about 45 degrees. Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon laughed awkwardly at their enthusiastic appearance.\u201cThere you go.\u201d\u201cYes. Seojun\u2019s mom could you make some powdered milk, and the team leader put the chair over here.\u201dSeo Eun-hye entered the waiting room and started preparing the powdered milk at the order of director Choi Dae-man. The team leader Kang So-ra put chairs in the center of the living room and turned them around. They shifted its position slightly depending on the camera screen.When Seo Eun-hye finished preparing the powdered milk, Choi Dae-man guided Lee Min-joon, who was holding Seojun, to the living room.Lee Min-joon carefully put Seojun down on the baby sofa. And he put the teddy bear next to him. The teddy bear\u2019s arm was placed in front of Seojun so that he could hug it anytime.\u201cSeojun, let\u2019s eat.\u201dSeo Eun-hye handed Seojun a baby bottle. Seojun grabbed the baby bottle with one small hand.It was a warm and delicious powdered milk. Seojun smiled brightly because the temperature of the warm baby bottle felt with his palm. He was so hungry just now.\u201cLet\u2019s get started!\u201dDirector Choi Dae-man shouted quietly. The set became silent in an instant. Choi Dae-man and Kang So-ra, the team leader, and Choi Hyun-ji, who suddenly appeared, turned their heads towards the big screen.Seojun with a baby bottle was being filmed on camera. Seojun bit the nipples.Squeeze, squeeze-On the set, only the sound of Seojun drinking powdered milk rang. Fortunately, he ate very well and didn\u2019t cry.\u201cIs that the mukbang?\u201dA staff member, who didn\u2019t watch Seojun\u2019s YouTube video, asked his senior. The senior nodded.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThe baby is very cute and eats well\u2026\u2026. That\u2019s normal. That\u2019s the way a baby should eat.\u201d\u201cChildren that age are usually very distracted.\u201dLike music video reviews, people who watched Seojun\u2019s eating show began to review it and uploaded on YouTube. It looked like they were eating together.\u201cBut the baby is really cute. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s conscious of the camera.\u201d\u201cDid you know what a camera is at that age?\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t the set a scary atmosphere? The lights are bright, there\u2019s no one around and it\u2019s quiet. There\u2019s also a lot of weird stuff\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was as the staff said. If it were another baby, they would burst into tears.\u201cDon\u2019t worry as long as he is eating right now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cThe next scene is more important than the current one. Please let\u2019s shoot it at once.\u201dThe staff also nodded at the senior\u2019s words.Cough-Seojun drank all the powdered milk. He burped in Seo Eun-hye\u2019s arms. Lee Min-joon, who was waiting for Seojun\u2019s hand to wave next to him, tilted his head.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cSeojun didn\u2019t wave his arms.\u201d\u201cWave? Come to think of it\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-hye recalled her memory. Come to think of it, Seojun didn\u2019t wave his arm even though there was a camera. He just drank powdered milk.\u201cWell, is it because he is holding a bottle?\u201d\u201cMaybe. Well, as long as it\u2019s good.\u201dSeojun, in his mother\u2019s arms, grinned.There was a limit to his skills Seojun could have because he was a baby.Fairy\u2019s glitter \u2013 the lowest level, which Seojun uses by waving his arms, was sent back to the library because of his new secret weapon.The skill was probably back in the book by now.Seojun recalled the skill he found.[Small Mimic\u2019s coveted packaging- High Level]It makes any packaged object be coveted.He can also specify a target.Limit: User size must be less than a certain amount.The object must be in user\u2019s arms.There were many restrictions, but these restrictions allowed him to use it\u2019s high-level skills even though he was a baby who lacked mana.This skill was an ability that he wouldn\u2019t be able to use as an adult. First of all, he could tell from the name \u2018Little Mimic\u2019. Only small things could use this skill.\u201cThen we\u2019ll move on to the next scene.\u201dAt the words of Choi Dae-man, Lee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye put Seojun down in the living room again. The baby sofa disappeared before they knew it, and Elephant milk powder bottles were stacked on the floor.In front of him, there was an Elephant powder bottle beside Seojun.\u201cSeojun, how about this?\u201d\u201cCome on, that\u2019s a pretty elephant.\u201dThe couple shook the powdered milk. Seojun, who secretly listened to the director while his mother\u2019s arms earlier, already knew that he had to hold this powder bottle and smile broadly.\u2018Fortunately, the director wanted me to hug the bottle, otherwise I would have cried until I could hugged it.\u2019[Little Mimic\u2019s coveted packaging] only worked when the user was holding the object. Seojun had to hug the powdered milk container because he had to make others want to buy powdered milk.\u201cArgh!\u201dSeojun smiled broadly and hugged the powdered milk. As the director said, the couple quickly escaped from the camera screen.[Packing the target with the little mimc coveted packaging \u2013 the highest level.]Seojunn hugged the box with the pattern of a small wooden box that only he can see and powdered milk as tightly as possible.The Elephant powder bottle he was holding shone with a very beautiful color, this sight was invisible to people.[Little Mimic\u2019s coveted packaging \u2013 highest level] was well invoked.\u201cTarget, parents with babies my age.\u201dIf the target is not set, people all over the world who watched the commercial will go crazy in order to buy powdered milk.\u2018Well\u2026\u2026\u2019there aren\u2019t few parents with babies\u2026\u2026. But it doesn\u2019t make sense if I can\u2019t sell out when I\u2019m in a commercial!\u2019Seojun laughed as he dreamed of selling it out.Director Choi Dae-man enlarged the camera screen.The baby was cute and handsome, his little laugh was captured very well by the camera. Some people couldn\u2019t look good in screen even if they looked good in person, but the baby came out so well that both sides were satisfied.\u2018And seeing that he don\u2019t care about cameras, this may be his talent when he grows up.\u2019Seojun\u2019s plump cheeks pressed the lid of the powdered milk container. Team leader Kang So-ra grabbed her heart with her slightly protruding cheeks.\u201cUgh.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cSo cute.\u201dChoi Hyun-ji sighed. She didn\u2019t express it, but she also wanted to destroy a couple of apartments.\u201cReally, I\u2019ve never seen such a cute baby before.\u201d\u201cYeah, wouldn\u2019t he be a big star if he grew up like this?\u201d\u201cIf it were my son, I\u2019d push him to be a real celebrity.\u201dNot only the team leaders but also other staff members were whispering.Seojun didn\u2019t stay still for a moment. He changed his posture as if he were trying to figure out how to look cuter.In the meantime, he never forgot to put a smiling face and hug the powdered milk.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon, who were alternately looking at Seojun and the people on the set, were lost in thought. Should they really make him a celebrity?\u201cSeojun, do you want to look this way?\u201dDirector Choi Dae-man said.The eight-month-old baby did so well that the Director Choi Dae-man, who is obsessed with filming, gave instructions without realizing it.Coincidentally or deliberately, Seojun turned his head and looked at the camera that Choi Dae-man was holding.\u201cHe, he, he!\u201dArgh!The shooting ended with Seojun\u2019s laugh.* * *\u201cHe is a genius.\u201dDirector Choi Dae-man said with a serious face. Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon nodded as if they had already expected it. Seojun was lying on the crib with a teddy bear and taking a nap.Only 20 minutes have passed and the commercial shoot was over.\u201cThis child must have talent to become an actor. He doesn\u2019t even understand it, but he instinctively knows what he has to do.\u201dChoi Dae-man did not think Seojun understood what he said.Luck, constitution, instinct.He thought Seojun had what it takes to be an actor.\u201cI\u2019m not saying he should be on TV or in movies from now on. There are no directors willing to shoot out such a young baby unless it\u2019s a very short role. I just thought it would be great to send him to the academy when he can start thinking talking or understand things.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still new in this world, but if you need my help, feel free to contact me.\u201dDirector Choi Dae-man wrote his contact information and name on a memo and handed it to Lee Min-joon.When Choi Dae-man left the waiting room, Choi Hyun-ji and Kang So-ra came in. Team leader Kang So-ra was dragging a large box onto the cart.\u201cThank you for your hard work. You did a great job. Seojuun.\u201d\u201cThank you. Thank you for your hard work. Both of you.\u201d\u201cAhahaha. Seojun did a great job. Oh, this is the baby sofa he sat on earlier with Elephant powdered milk. It would be Seojun\u2019s present.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe schedule ended in a friendly atmosphere.The staff, who were prepared to suffer from the baby all day while preparing for the powdered milk commercial shoot, also started packing the shooting, which has ended in less than an hour.\u201cSeojun, bye!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll buy my nephew powdered milk.\u201d\u201cElephant milk will sold out! Way to go!\u201dWith the support of the staff, the family returned home.* * *\u2018My son\u2019s meal time.\u2019Eric turned on a YouTube video. It was a video of [JUN] which he was watching five times a day.He watched it so much that he had already memorized at what timing Seo-joon laughed, waved his arms at what angle, and chewed on baby food.\u201cCome on, Jack, it\u2019s your favorite JUN.\u201d\u201cLike, like!\u201dMaria, who just returned from a business trip to Paris, also sat down at the table to feed Jack.She was also praising JUN\u2019s video. Maria pressed down on the video.There was calm music. It was the usual JUN\u2019s dad\u2019s voice.\u201cOh, there\u2019s an ad coming up.\u201d\u201cNo way. How many views\u2026\u2026.\u201dEric and Maria were subscribers since it was released but after few days they were sick and tired of seeing the number of views and subscribers going up.\u201cWhat kind of ad is it?\u201d\u201cOh, isn\u2019t that Elephant powdered milk?\u201dA yellow elephant appeared. The image of a yellow elephant raising its nose upward was changed from a video to a picture and attached to a milk powder bottle. And\u2026\u201cOh! Isn\u2019t that JUN?\u201d\u201cYeah, I think they did a commercial! Cute!\u201dSeojun was seen smiling and drinking powdered milk. And Seojun\u2019s grin with Elephant\u2019s milk powder bottle was the last part.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was quiet.Eric and Maria picked up the phone without saying a word. They went to overseas delivery site and searched Elephant.\u201cDamn! Out of stock!\u201d\u201cNo! I really want to buy this now!\u201dThe effect of the coveted packaging of the little mimic \u2013 was incredible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I remember how much the other staff members complimented us. Besides, he had never cried and finished filming in a heartbeat!\u201dShe was busy telling Seojun\u2019s grandmother about the shooting. She looked really happy showing off her son with a big smile. He saw his maternal grandmother\u2019s face on the video call screen.Seojun sometimes waved to his maternal grandmother while drinking powdered milk. His maternal grandmother smiled broadly and said, \u201cOh my gosh! Seojun waved at me!\u201d\u201cBy the way, when will my grandson\u2019s commercial be on TV? I keep watching but I still can\u2019t see it.\u201dSeo Eun-hye laughed awkwardly at her mother\u2019s words.\u201cThe ad will only be on YouTube, an ad that goes out on the Internet. The advertisement went so well that the company doesn\u2019t have any milk to sell anymore. They say there are going to be delays until they could make more milk powder.\u201dTeam leader Kang So-ra, who came to their home in person, told them about their sold-out, saying that the advertising model fee was set at three months\u2019 ad after paying for all Internet and television ads as originally contracted, but if the TV ad exceeds the deadline, let\u2019s sign again.She bowed her head to apologize for the delay of the advertisement, but she couldn\u2019t erase the smile from her face because she was achieving a new sales record.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon were also happy that their advertising contracts were extended. Her apologies were just some sort of courtesy.\u201cSo I can\u2019t watch it on TV? You\u2026 you tube? How do you say that?\u201d\u201cAsk Chan. His nephew appeared in the commercial, but he didn\u2019t show it to his mom. What\u2019s he been up to lately?\u201dThe he heard his maternal grandmother sigh.\u201cHe\u2019s busy.\u201d\u201cWhy? Was he still searching for a job?\u201d\u201cHe find one\u2026 He is now working.\u201d\u201cDid he? Why didn\u2019t he tell me?\u201dSeojun recalled his uncle Chan at his mother\u2019s words.Seo Eun-Chan.He was a very scary-looking uncle. If his mother and Uncle were to be put side by side, they would looked like a beauty and the beast because he was big and rugged.He said he couldn\u2019t get a job because of his face, and it was his mother who always lamented the fact he couldn\u2019t get a job.\u201cGood for him! He got a job. What\u2019s his work?\u201d\u201cHis work\u2026 Something related with celebrities\u2026?His maternal grandmother was searching for something on the video call. And soon she took out a white paper and read it.\u201cCocoa Entertainment, he is a manager there.\u201d\u201cCoco Entertainment? I\u2019ve never heard of it before.\u201d\u201cI know. Is this a new company? He said he was really busy making a group, so he didn\u2019t even come home. I don\u2019t know how many days it\u2019s been already, Hye.\u201dSeo Eun-hye\u2019s face also showed worries at his maternal grandmother\u2019s sigh.Seo Eun-hye quickly changed the story.\u201cLook at our cute Seojun!\u201dSeojun\u2019s smiling face was reflected in the video call screen. His maternal grandmother laughed again.\u201cThat ass\u2014rascal brother of mine, making mother worry like that!\u201dSeo Eun-hye, who hung up the phone, tried to curse but because there is Seojun she changed her words.Then she dialed a new number.The number was Seo Eun-chan\u2019s, that rascal!\u201cAccept it.\u201dHis mother was currently gritting her teeth while calling her brother..\u2026.That\u2019s it.\u201cAbububu!\u201d\u201cAh. Did Seojun finished eating?\u201d\u2018I\u2019m done eating!\u2019Seo Eun-hye quickly picked Seojun up and helped him burped, after that she put Seojun down on the sofa again.Then she took any doll from the pile of dolls his uncle Hee-sung gifted Seojun and gave it to him.\u201cMom would be busy for a while. Just play your favorite doll for a while, okay?\u201dPerhaps she was really busy because the doll she gave Seojun was her least favorite, the Lich King doll.\u201cAbu-bu-boo-boops!\u201dSeojun, whose upper teeth seem to be growing these days, was itchy.He put the Lich King doll on his mouth, which his mother washed cleanly.Clack-\u201cYes! I\u2019m Seo Eun-chan, the Manager under Cocoa Entertainment!\u201dSoon they heard his uncle\u2019s loud voice. Seojun, who was still eating the skeleton doll, tilted his head.Seo Eun-Hye also tilted her head.\u201cSeo Eun-chan, Manager?\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019m Seo Eun Chan. Excuse me, who are you?\u201dSeojun recognize Seo Eun-chan\u2019s lively voice.Isn\u2019t he his uncle? Unlike Seojun, who was still thinking why his uncle doesn\u2019t know his mother, Seo Eun-hye immediately noticed why.\u201cAbububu?\u201d\u201cYou son of a\u2026.\u201d\u201cHello?\u201dSeo Eun-hye, who had nearly lost her temper in front of her son, screamed because she couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even save my number?\u201d\u201cOuch! Sister? What\u2019s wrong with you? Did you change your number?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been three years since I last changed!\u201d\u201cHahaha. Why didn\u2019t I know?\u201dSeo Eun-hye slapped her forehead.\u201cYeah, well, the phone number doesn\u2019t matter. But I heard you\u2019ve been doing well. Also I heard you were not going home these days?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. I got a job, so I\u2019m a little busy.\u201d\u201cMom was worried. Take your time and go back home.\u201dBeyond the cell phone, Seo Eun-chan sighed quietly and answered.\u201cI got it, okay.\u201d\u201cYeah, stop by my house when you\u2019re not busy, and let\u2019s call again next time. Save my number!\u201cGive my hello to Seojun and my brother-in-law!\u201dSeo Eun-hye, who hung up the phone, took the doll out of Seojun\u2019s mouth, who was sitting in front of her and sucking the hands of the Lich King doll.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your uncle? But I\u2019m glad he got a job.\u201dSeo Eun-hye\u2019s smile followed Seojun\u2019s smile. But that smile didn\u2019t last long either.***\u201cNo, seriously! Doesn\u2019t this guy even recognize his nephew?!\u201dShe was looking at the emails that arrived for the YouTube channel [JUN] with Lee Min-joon after work.There have been many other advertising proposals besides Elephant powdered milk. Among them, she often looked into Seojun\u2019s product because she thought it would be okay to let him be their advertising model.\u201cIt\u2019s here today again.\u201dLee Min-joon pointed to an email. Seo Eun-Hye also knew about that email.There was an email that had been sent steadily once a day from the day Seojun\u2019s video was uploaded on YouTube.It was some kind of Internet broadcasting proposal, but both Lee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye had always overlooked the e-mail.Seo Eun-hye clicked the email.\u201cI wonder what\u2019s the content of this email.\u201d\u201cYeah, they proposed to make an entertainment show on YouTube.\u201d\u201cLike a web drama?\u201d\u201cMore like a web entertainment/web variety show.\u201dThe screen has changed.[Hello, we\u2019re Cocoa Entertainment]That was the beginning. Seojun also read it while sitting on his father\u2019s arms.\u2018Cocoa, Entertainment? It\u2019s\u2026\u2019\u201cHuh? This is\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dHe also read what Seo Eun-hye was reading. Lee Min-joon turned his head to see Seo Eun-hye\u2019s response.Well, he turned his head again. Seojun also turned his head quickly after seeing his mother.[\u2026\u2026 I discovered the channel [JUN] when I was planning for a baby variety show, JUN captured the hearts of babies all over the world with one mukbang show! If you give us a chance, please appear on the baby variety show we are planning.\u2026.]The introduction wasn\u2019t what caught their attention.[If you are interested, please contact us at the contact information below.]Yes, this was the problem.[Manager Seo Eun-chan 010-XXXX-XXXX]\u201cHuh? Seo Eun-chan? It\u2019s the same name as my brother-in-law\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, seriously! Doesn\u2019t this guy even recognize his nephew?!\u201dOnly then did his father, who figured out the situation, sat down and step aside. Seojun also remained quiet.His mom quickly took out her phone and called.\u201cYes! I\u2019m Seo Eun-chan, the manager under Cocoa Entertainment!\u201d\u201cShh. Seojun, be quiet. If you make a noise with how your mom now\u2026\u2026. What a big problem will happen!\u201dLee Min-joon carefully covered Seojun\u2019s mouth with his big hand. Seojun couldn\u2019t help but wave his arms up and down. It may not be seen from Seo Eun-Chan, who is far away, but it was all Seojun could do.\u2018Uncle! Uncle Chan is in danger!\u2019Seo Eun-hye smiled broadly and lowered her voice.\u201cOh, I\u2019m calling after reading your YouTube mail.\u201d\u201cAh! Is this Jun\u2019s mother? Nice to meet you! I\u2019m Seo Eun-chan, a manager under Cocoa Entertainment!\u201d\u201cShh!\u201dTwo men saw their mother smiling devilish. Seojun sighed inside.His uncle didn\u2019t save his mother\u2019s number yet again.***\u201cBut I\u2019d like to see you in person, would that be okay?\u201d\u201cGo to your sister house.\u201d\u201cNoona\u2019s house?\u201d (From what Eun-Hye said, Seo Eun-chan\u2019s thought it was an apartment called Noona)Seo Eun-chan, who answered the phone, tilted his head to see if an apartment is called like that.The four men, who had been watching Seo Eun-chan since he took the phone call, also tilted their heads.Seo Eun-chan was with the four-member boy idol group to debut under Cocoa Entertainment, where he got a job.The group\u2019s name has yet to be decided, but Seo Eun-chan and the members were already talking about their future schedules at their dorm.\u201cNoona\u2019s house? Is there such an apartment in Korea?\u201dIn charge of the rap part. It was Korean-American Kevin Kim.\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never heard of it before.\u201dThe lead vocalist Park Seo-jin, who would always search for things he didn\u2019t know, picked up his cell phone.\u201cBut Jun! I can\u2019t believe it! I\u2019m so glad for us!\u201d\u201cYeah! I didn\u2019t think it would work!\u201dFirst of all, Choi Si-yoon, the dancer who suggested making a YouTube channel, and Hwang Ye-joon, the sub-vocalist who suggested a the theme with baby, were the most elated.It was then.\u201cI told you to come to your sister\u2019s house right now. You stupid son of a bitch who doesn\u2019t even recognize his own nephew!\u201dA loud voice rang from the cell phone, it was really loud. Seo Eun-chan, who was holding the cell phone to his ear, also frightened the other four men who were talking quietly.\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-chan quickly looked at his cell phone.\u201cWhat? Why is Jun\u2019s mother on the previous call list\u2026\u2026?\u201dSeo Eun-chan recalled the call logs.\u201cSister? Sister?\u201d\u201cGasp!\u201d\u201cI told you to save my phone number, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cNo, sister! Wait. Are you reallly my older sister?\u201d\u201cDid you have a sister other than me?\u201d\u201cNo, no. Oh, then Jun on channel [JUN]\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your nephew, Seojun! How can you not recognize your own nephew that you just saw a month ago!\u201dSeo Eun-chan stuttered and continued the conversation.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cNiece? What\u2019s a niece?\u201d\u201cNephew! His sister\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cOh! Nephew!\u201dWhen Kevin, who is not good at Korean, asked, their leader Park Seo-jin replied. Hwang Ye-joon kept being a commentator.\u201cWow, 200,000 subscribers. The manager has a superstar as nephew.\u201d\u201cHey, he doesn\u2019t look like our manager.\u201dChoi Si-yoon quickly turned on YouTube and turned on a video from the channel [JUN].Four men huddled together to watch the video. A cute-looking baby was eating every spoonful. Four people\u2019s eyes were on the baby and then on Seo Eun-chan.A man, who seemed to caused other kneel if they bump into him, was being stared by the four people beside.They were glad they had gotten used to his face in the last three weeks, but it was still a horrible to look at.Hwang Ye-joon whispered quietly.\u201cThey don\u2019t really look alike.\u201dIn the meantime, Seo Eun-chan, exhausted after hearing a nagging from Seo Eun-hye, barely hung up the phone.He slumped down on the chair and bowed his head.Oh, his ears were numb. He could still hear his tinnitus beeping.\u201cManager, are you okay?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAt Park Seo-jin\u2019s words, Seo Eun-chan answered by waving his hands. Park Seo-jin shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t think you are all right, manager.\u201d\u201cYour sister sounds really scary.\u201dMembers nodded at Kevin\u2019s comments.Seo Eun-chan, who was sitting in a chair for a while, raised his head. He remembered his sister\u2019s last words while he was daydreaming.\u201cCome to my house now!\u201dSeo Eun-chan quickly got up from his seat, packed his wallet, cell phone, and clothes.Four men\u2019s eyes looked at Seo Eun-chan.Park Seo-jin asked.\u201cManager, where are you going?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026.I have to go to my sister\u2019s house now.\u201d\u201cYep! See you!\u201dHe didn\u2019t even have to reply back. Seo Eun-chan waved at Kevin\u2019s greeting and quickly ran out of the door.Looking at the closing door, the four quietly prayed for the safe return of Seo Eun-chan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seo Eun-hye\u2019s eyes, which greeted her younger brother right in front of the front door, were fierce.Seojun and Lee Min-joon held their breath and clung closely to the sofa.Seo Eun-chan had something in his hand.He was so scared to meet his sister after a month that Seo Eun-chan stopped by a nearby mart and bought a gift for his nephew.\u201cHahaha. This is Seojun\u2019s present.\u201d\u201cIs this a bribe?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026uh.\u201dSeo Eun-chan, whose intentions were immediately revealed, replied with a discouraged face. Seo Eun-hye sighed and moved away.Seo Eun-chan carefully came into the living room. He saw two people staying still in the corner of the sofa.\u201cHello, brother-in-law. Hi, Seojun.\u201d\u201cLong time no see.\u201d\u201cOh, my!\u201dSeo Eun-chan, who had just handed Seojun\u2019s gift to Lee Min-joon, kneeled down in a corner of the living room and bowed his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cGive me your phone.\u201d\u201cSaved!\u201dSeo Eun-hye, who took a cell phone from Seo Eun-chan, looked through the contact list, sighed and sat down. This time, Seo Eun-hye\u2019s phone number was saved properly.\u201cHow come you can\u2019t even recognize your own nephew?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026 babies all look alike. And it\u2019s already been a month since I\u2019ve seen him. How could I know that Seojun became so famous?\u201dSeo Eun-hye slapped her forehead at her younger brother\u2019s vague answer.\u201cYes, he\u2019s not your son. You may not recognize him immediately.\u201d\u201cAbububu.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget my phone number anymore.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYou are also going home today.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-chan hesitated for a moment.At his hesitation, Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s eyes glared at him fiercely.Seo Eun-chan, who saw her face, talked hastily.\u201cI got a job three weeks ago and because my company is new, I\u2019m already a manager. They I don\u2019t have many employees. That\u2019s why we need to debut an idol group. I happened to have booked a music show a month later, so I\u2019ve been busy preparing for it\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause of that you\u2019re busy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get home until I let the group be present on the music show.\u201d\u201cWhere are you staying at?\u201d\u201cMy kids are all boys, so we stay together in the dorm that the company has arranged for them. I don\u2019t know anything else, but our company\u2019s welfare is good and our accommodation is good!\u201dSeo Eun-hye ignored her younger brother, who seemed to boast about their accommodation right away, and asked.\u201cCan you go home after the music show?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026.depends\u2026 what if we fail?\u201dLee Min-joon and Seojun shook their heads while listening to his story.Seo Eun-hye looked at Seo Eun-chan with a pathetic look on her face as if she were thinking the same thing.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll try not to ruin it.\u201dSeo Eun-chan apologized quietly as if he felt the eyes of the three.\u201cWhat if it does well?\u201d\u201cIf things go well\u2026\u2026. After that, I have to attend events in order to go on air. I\u2019m the current head of the department, and I\u2019m also the manager.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll be busier than you are now?\u201d\u201cYeah, right?\u201dIn Seo Eun-chan\u2019s half-hearted responses, Seon Eun-hye soon seemed to have given up.\u201cWell, you\u2019re turning 30 next year. You\u2019ll do good on your own. At least call mom some times.\u201d\u201cOh! I\u2019ll do it more often.\u201dSeo Eun-chan answered quickly, looking at the situation.\u201cBecause you are have a meal or snack. Did you already eat dinner?\u201d\u201cI ate!\u201d\u201cThen have a cup of coffee.\u201dSeo Eun-hye got up and headed to the kitchen. The three men breathed a sigh of relief quietly. Lee Min-joon, who felt that the disturbance was over, opened his mouth.\u201cBut what\u2019s the story with the web show, brother-in-law?\u201d\u201cOh, that.\u201dSeo Eun-chan hesitated. He thought he\u2019d ride the popularity of the YouTube baby star if it got accepted but it was actually his own nephew.He was wondering if he could still talk about it in this unexpected situation.\u201cSo, what are you talking about?\u201dSeo Eun-hye asked while putting the coffee on the table.There were three cups, one for his mom, father and Uncle. He doesn\u2019t have one.The sulky Seojun opened his mouth and burst into tears but before he did so, a baby biscuit came into his mouth.\u201cCome on, this is your snack.\u201d\u2018Dad remembered me, thank you.\u2019\u201cBoo-boob!\u201d\u2018It\u2019s delicious! Banana flavor!\u2019It was delicious to nibble it with his lower teeth. Seojun grabbed the snack with one hand and sucked it hard.Seo Eun-hye, who praised Lee Min-joon with her eyes, turned her head and looked at Seo Eun-chan with sharp eyes.Seo Eun-chan swallowed his saliva and opened his mouth.\u201cMy kids are completely unknown, so they don\u2019t have any fans. Why we need fans? It will do well if someone know about us, before we go on a music show. It is good to have some exposure to at least let them know their names, so I uploaded a music video that I worked hard on and posted articles on the Internet, but the number of views were not really good. At this rate we may be forgotten before we even started.\u201dSeo Eun-chan, who finished talking, took a sip of coffee.\u201cOne of the members suggested that we post a show on YouTube to gain some fans. Let\u2019s not have a definite script, but make it like a short entertainment show. Among entertainment shows, shows with baby are popular these days, so a member suggested that it would be good.\u201d\u201cSo you choose Seojun?\u201d\u201cSeojun is famous, so we could ride on his popularity\u2026\u2026.Uh\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou are going to use him?\u201d\u201cNo, but just let him appear for a while\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you are planning on doing?\u201d\u201cNo, it is\u2026.\u201dAgain, that was a close call. Using his nephew\u2026 He need to choose his wording correctly.Seo Eun-hye was lost in her own thoughts. He was her younger brother who had been unemployed for three years and had always been low on self-esteem.But now that he got a job, he fixed himself up and carefully took care of his image.His beard was shaved clean and his hair was neat. With his formal clothes he seemed to start acting like a normal person again.\u2018What, if the company goes bust, will he be unemployed again?\u2019As it was a new company, it was clear that the idol\u2019s debut would have been doomed.It was bound to be difficult, if not bad.Seo Eun-hye drank some coffee.\u2018It\u2019s good to help my brother, but\u2026\u2026.\u2019It was different from making a mukbang video with only two people in the showEven though it was aired on YouTube, not on television, entertaining was still an entertainment show.Many people would know about Seojun and she was worried about what would happen.\u201cI agree.\u201d\u201cAbububu!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLee Min-joon raised his hand. Seojun, who finished eating snacks, also raised his hand. He didn\u2019t think much about it and just agreed to whichever makes him a superstar.Somehow the two similar men were raising their hands in the same pose. Seo Eun-hye unwinded her hardened face and smiled.\u201cLook. Seojun says yes too!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It will become a memory for Seojun. I am usually busy going to work and you\u2019re busy taking care of Seojun, how can we take a video of Seojun all day? It\u2019ll be very good memory later on to him.\u201dHe said so, but maybe he was just doing it for her and Seo Eun-chan.In gratitude, Seo Eun-hye clenched her husband\u2019s hand. Lee Min-joon also held his wife\u2019s hand. The couple\u2019s eyes were filled with emotion.Before they knew it, Seojun, who escaped from his father\u2019s arms, sat on his uncle Chan\u2019s lap and leaned his back on his uncle\u2019s belly.Seo Eun-chan also quietly examined the atmosphere.\u201cStill newlywed. The two of you.\u201d\u201cAbububu.\u201dSeo Eun-chan put a baby snack in Seojun\u2019s mouth and quietly left the living room and headed to Seojun\u2019s toy room.Seo Eun-chan closed the door tightly.\u201cSigh, sister. She scared me to death.\u201dHe shuddered. Then he sat on the floor, hugged and Seojun. He talked to him as if Seojun could understand.\u201cSeojun, your mom. It\u2019s really scary. Right?\u201cAbububu!\u201d\u201cBe careful not to get in trouble later. This could run in our blood. There will be no one who would accept you unless you act like brother-in-law. My brother-in-law seems to be a Buddha.\u201dSeo Eun-chan grumbled and saw Seojun. He was so cute seeing him sucking the snacks in one hand.\u201cDo you look this cute because you\u2019re my nephew? Or are kids all cute?\u201d\u201cThey are supposed to be cute.\u201d\u201cHeeep!\u201dThe door opened.Seo Eun-hye stood there.\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat I said before to Seojun..\u201d\u201cYour brother-in-law is Buddha?\u201d\u201cYou heard everything!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense and get out of here.\u201d\u201cSeojun can hear everything. You are a bad teacher!\u201dSeo Eun-hye hugged Seojun and snorted.\u201cSeojun is smart, so he doesn\u2019t use bad words.\u201d\u201cAbububu!\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right!\u201cLook, I see.\u201dSeo Eun-chan was at a loss for words at his sister\u2019s words.\u201cSo he is going to be on the show?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hear the plan first. We didn\u2019t tell you what we were going to film. And let\u2019s hear how much we\u2019re going to lose.\u201dSeo Eun-chan nodded at the words of determined Seo Eun-hye.\u201cThis is how you do it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo! First of all, this. Let\u2019s start discussing about the project?\u201dSeo Eun-chan quickly took out his phone and opened the file.The file was written by the president of Cocoa Entertainment, huddling together with the members.With how the word document was written amateurish, it definitely stood out to her that they were really newbie in the industry.Seo Eun-chan opened his mouth.\u201cFor now, we\u2019ve decided with 48 hours as filming time.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that too long?\u201dIt was a tackle from the beginning. Seo Eun-chan, who had a lot to say but said he would not.\u201c24 hours is too short, sister. It\u2019ll be over as soon as we get to know each other.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s move on.\u201d\u201cFirst of all\u2026 okay. And I think the number of episodes uploaded on YouTube depends on the amount of footage taken, but we\u2019re thinking about 8 episodes with 15 minutes. First of all, there are many people who watch YouTube short videos, right? And if we upload two episodes a week, we can release them four weeks later before the music show.\u201dLee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye nodded. Seo Eun-chan, who gained confidence, said.\u201cI\u2019m going to upload the channel to our group channel, and I hope Seojun will promote our channel later.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll give you a separate promotional fee.\u201dWhen Seo Eun-hye raised her hand, Seo Eun-chan, who grasped her sister\u2019s innermost thoughts, quickly said.Seo Eun-Hye smiled as if she was satisfied.\u201cThere\u2019s Christmas happening soon, so I\u2019m going to film one or two episodes with that concept, and the rest are just going to film his daily life.\u201dListening to the story, she also think 48 hours was not enough.\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t have enough content?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m thinking of eight to ten minutes each. Or about 4 episodes, with 10 minutes each\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-chan, who glossed over his words, sighed.\u201cI don\u2019t think Seojun going to come out that much? What do you think, sister? Seojun, do you think he has a good sense of humor?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want from an eight-month-old baby? What about your members\u2019 entertainment skills?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026.\u201dAt Seo Eun-hye\u2019s question, Seo Eun-chan recalled his boys.Leader Park Seo-jin, Kevin Kim who speaks English fast. Naughty Hwang Ye-joon. The youngest, Choi Si-Yoon.They\u2019ve only met for three weeks, and each of them have unique characters. But for entertainment\u2026.\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cPhew.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gonna work out. Seojun is already a YouTube star. It\u2019s going to be amazing if 500,000 subscribers watch it all once.\u201dLee Min-joon patted his depressed brother and wife on the shoulder and said.While Seojun shrugged his shoulders and made some baby noises.\u201cSaboo!\u201dYes, the channel [JUN] already has more than 500,000 subscribers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If the product on this shopping website is sold out, doesn\u2019t it mean that almost all the products from all over the world are sold out? Wow. How is it so effective?

Just read this book when you have time to look at that bullshit.\u201dHwang Ye-joon, who was stared by Park Seo-jin\u2019s eyes as if he was half dead, quietly turned off the computer and took a book.\u201cI\u2019m sleepy whenever I read a real book.\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.

You know that, right?\u201d\u201cOf course I do. How much should I spend?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll be back!\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026\u201dChoi Si-yoon, who was busy wearing the shoes excitedly at the thought of looking around the new products at the electronics corner of a large mart, stood stiff after hearing the voice of Park Seo-jin muttering quietly.\u201cIf Seojun doesn\u2019t like the toys, you won\u2019t be able to use your precious electronics for a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026For how long?\u201dPark Seo-jin smiled refreshingly like an idol in front of the fan with fiercely sparkling eyes.Choi Si-yoon got goosebumps as if he was facing a devil\u2019s smile.\u201cIf you fail\u2026 how about for life?\u201dPark Seojin. The leader of Brown Black (BB), who hasn\u2019t even debuted yet, was putting his life and soul on the line for this shoot.* * *\u201cAll right, I\u2019m done installing!\u201dUncle Chan said. His uncle, who came home early in the morning, installed the cameras everywhere, from living room to his bedroom to the kitchen.\u201cHere and here. And I installed it here, too.\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t be there anyway. You don\u2019t have to tell me, do you?\u201d\u201cThe landlord should know.\u201dAt Seo Eun-hye\u2019s question, Eun-chan answered with a shrug. Then I picked up his cell phone and called.\u201cUh, it\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cYes! Wait a minute!\u201dPark Seo-jin, who answered Seo Eun-chan\u2019s phone call, was sitting on the passenger seat looked at the members staring at him.\u201cThis is Seojun\u2019s house, apartment parking lot.\u201dThere were four men sitting in the black tinted car, half leaning, half worried, half at a loss.Beyond the cell phone, Seo Eun-chan said.\u201cCome up when you\u2019re ready. Don\u2019t forget that there\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHe cut him off.Park Seo-jin, who was looking at the black screen, raised his head.The four of them knew well each other after spending a long time as trainees and settled in Cocoa Entertainment.They\u2019ve been through a lot of frustration and failure. They have nothing else but this fate, so all four of them thought this was their last chance.\u201cThis could be the last time. It\u2019s different from other companies where they can postpone their debut at any time they like. There are only few places that make this opportunity for us, who haven\u2019t even debuted yet.\u201dPark Seojin was encouraging the members as the leader.\u201cEveryone, let\u2019s cheer up!\u201dHe opened the locked car door wide.* * *\u201cHello! It\u2019s Brown Black!\u201dThe four men bowed 90 degrees to greet the couple.Seojun, who was being hugged by his father, clapped his hands at their great enthusiasm, while Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon took a step back in a cold sweat.Seo Eun-chan expressed his pride by looking at his already grown children.\u201cB, Brown, Black?\u201d\u201cYes, brother-in-law. We\u2019ve decided on a group name. If you shorten it, it\u2019s BB. You can just call them Double B. Isn\u2019t it okay?\u201cIs that\u2026 is that so? Nice to meet you. I\u2019m Seojun\u2019s dad, Lee Min-joon.\u201dLee Min-joon welcomed the four people with an awkward smile. Seo Eun-hye also said her hello.\u201cNice to meet you. I am Seojun\u2019s mom, Seo Eun-Hye.\u201d\u201cShe is my sister.\u201dThe members nodded at Seo Eun-chan\u2019s words. She was the main character from the phone.Unlike the fierce-looking Seo Eun-chan, she was an ordinary beauty.\u201cHello! I\u2019m Park Seo-jin, the leader of Brown Black.\u201d\u201cRapper, Kevin Kim.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Hwang Ye-joon, the sub-vocalist.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Choi Si-yoon, the youngest and the main dancer.\u201dThen they bowed down again at 90 degrees.Lee Min-joon quickly led them to seat. There was not enough space on the sofa, so everyone sat on the living room floor.There were fruits and snacks on the table, but Brown Black was very stiff as if they are being interrogated, so they couldn\u2019t give any attention at the refreshments and couldn\u2019t move.Seo Eun-hye opened her mouth at the awkward atmosphere.\u201cAre there any others?\u201dShe thought that the production team would come like in a Variety entertainment show, but she didn\u2019t think they weren\u2019t needed.Seo Eun-chan shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it that big. Just a little bit. The camera has already been installed and has already started recording, and the rest is just me and..\u2026 wait\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-chan got up from his seat and called someone.\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s on the 12th floor. Yes, apartment number five.\u201dHe talked to someone for a while and hung up.\u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201dAt the same time, there was a ding-dong. When Seo Eun-chan opened the door, a short-haired woman with a large bag stood.\u201cHello.\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon, who were sitting, also stood up and greeted. Seo Jun, who was hugging his dad, also said hi.Brown Black, who had no idea what to do, jumped up and bowed to the new guest.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cThis is a pediatrician, Kim Hwa-ryeon. She\u2019s also our public relations team leader.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Kim Hwa-ryeon.\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon\u2019s were shocked.\u201cNo, what kind of filming are you doing by bringing in a pediatrician?\u201d\u201cSeojun\u2019s will be filming with strangers for 48 hours without his mom and dad. Did you really think he will be safe? I\u2019m an uncle, so I worry for him that\u2019s why I call a Pediatrician.\u201dSeo Eun-hye admired her brother\u2019s deep thoughts.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be this thoughtful. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201dSeo Eun-chan, turned his eyes. He was looking towards a Brown Black\u2019s member.Seo Eun-hye, Lee Min-joon, and Seojun\u2019s eyes also turned to that direction.The four men cringed as people\u2019s eyes were on them.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, it was actually Seo-jin\u2019s suggestion.\u201d\u201cOf course it is.\u201d\u201cNo, sister!\u201dSeo Eun-hye\u2019s eyes changed. As expected, her younger brother was still her younger brother.Lee Min-joon, who was already familiar with the fight between the brother and sister, headed in front of the man who introduced himself as Park Seo-jin.Lee Min-joon was deeply moved by Park Seo-jin\u2019s consideration and dedication for the baby.In addition, idols \u2013 even though they haven\u2019t debuted yet \u2013 they didn\u2019t seem to have any accessories or makeup to prevent harm to the baby.The front door was full of luggage brought by Brown Black. Looking at the objects sticking out of the bag, they must have search a lot about babies.He thought he could trust them Seojun with confidence.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cNo, No it is our pleasure!\u201d\u201cCome on. Do you want to hug Seojun?\u201dLee Min-joon handed Seojun over to Park Seo-jin.Park Seo-jin, who had never held a young baby around before, carried Seojun carefully, with his hands shaking.\u201cSaboo!\u201d\u2018It\u2019s a little uncomfortable\u2026\u2026.\u2019Seeing the expressions of Park Seo-jin and the other three, Seojun decided to hold on his cry.Lee Min-joon corrected Park Seo-jin\u2019s posture.\u201cIf you hug him like that, Seojun would feel uncomfortable, so put your arms in\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeojun, who was now in a comfortable with his father\u2019s coaching, smiled brightly.He was always in the arms of the same people every day, but it felt different to be hugged by a first timer.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cMs. Kim Hwa-ryeon!\u201d\u201c[Doctor! Doctor!]\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dBrown Black was devastated by Seojun\u2019s laugh.Park Seo-jin and Kevin called for a doctor, and Choi Si-yoon took out the toys he bought quickly. Hwang Ye-joon was so embarrassed that he couldn\u2019t say a word and just screamed.It was a mess.\u201cIs this\u2026 is it okay?\u201d\u201cWe have a doctor. But isn\u2019t this pretty funny?\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon talked quietly. As Lee Min-joon said, it was only for a few minutes, but they were already laughing at their sight.Seo Eun-chan gave a satisfied smile as he recalled the cameras akready installed in the living room.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I installed them in advance.\u201dKim Hwa-ryeon carefully close the camera she has been holding since coming in the apartment.It was a camera used in the dance practice room in Cocoa Entertainment.\u201cI\u2019ve been filming since I came in. I\u2019ve captured them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great! It\u2019d be great if there were a lot of things we could use to edit.\u201dSeo Eun-chan smiled and tried to take the camera from Kim Hwa-ryeon, but Kim Hwa-ryeon immediately stepped back.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dKim Hwa-ryeon didn\u2019t dare to say it but Seo Eun-chan, who has been living with his fierce face for 29 years, noticed it at once. The problem was his scary-looking face.As he thought, Kim Hwa-ryeon stepped back without realizing it was due to Seo Eun-chan\u2019s ugly face.\u201cGive me the recording later\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u2018Hahahaha.\u2019\u201cDoctor! Seojun kept laughing!\u201d\u201c[Are you sick? Why is he laughing so hard?!]\u201d\u201cKevin, stop speaking English! Speak Korean! We don\u2019t understand! I think Seojoon is laughing so hard! Doctor!\u201d\u201cLet me give you this, shall I?\u201dSeo Eun-chan turned his head to the sight ful of chaos.Brown Black were busy soothing Seojun. Choi Si-yoon was walking around him holding a doll taken out from a large luggage bag.Seo Eun-chan slapped his forehead.\u201cNo, that\u2019s because you guys are such a chaos.\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dSeo Eun-chan\u2019s words didn\u2019t even catch Brown Black\u2019s ears. He was so embarrassed that they couldn\u2019t hear anything.Seojun has never seen such funny people. He laughed so hard that he was about to cry\u2026\u2026.\u201cSeojun\u2019s tears!\u201d\u201cHe is tearing!\u201d\u201cSeojun is crying!\u201d\u201c[Doctor!Doctor!Doctor! He\u2019s laughing and crying. Sick, sick is he sick?!]\u201d\u201cCan someone else carry Seojun instead of me?\u201dThe power of tears was great. Hwang Ye-joon and Choi Si-yoon were in a hurry and Kevin shouted \u201cDoctor!\u201d Park Seo-jin held Seojun with trembling arms and broke into a cold sweat.Looking at the chaotic Brown Black, Seojun\u2019s Mom and dad were laughing while holding their stomachs, and finally the doctor and uncle Chan burst into laughter.Seojun also smiled pleasantly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Will you be able to do well for 48 hours if you get tired to something this?\u201dSeo Eun-chan asked.Hearing her, Brown Black\u2019s complexion turned pale.Only 10 minutes? 48 hours is 2,880 minutes\u2026\u2026.Park Seo-jin, who was busy calculating with his hands, trembled.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll get used to it quickly, you will a struggle a little bit because you are first timers.\u201dThe four were comforted a little by Seo Eun-hye\u2019s words.Seo Eun-hye took out a stack of A4 paper and put it on the table.Brown Black, Seo Eun-chan, and Kim Hwa-ryeon\u2019s eyes turned to the stack of paper.Seojun know what was writted in those papers.These papers contains the summary of the parenting books that his Mom and Dad read last night.It could be said that it was a customized parenting book for Seojun, which they even wrote down Seojun\u2019s likes and dislikes in great detail for Brown Black.With this, they could take care of Seojun for 48 hours without making him uncomfortable due to the absence of his mom and dad.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cAll about Seojun\u2019s needs and how to take care of him. First of all.\u201dSeo Eun-hye, who answered Seo Eun-chan\u2019s question, opened the book. The first page.\u201cSeojun\u2019s time is divided to eat, take a nap, plays, and sleeps at night for 12 hours.\u201dBrown Black read the first chapter and listened to the explanation.The A4 papers were filled with the baby\u2019s daily schedule.He eat every 3 hours and take a nap twice a day.\u201cSeojun knows exactly when to eat, so you have to give it to him before he cry. Not a minute late.\u201d\u201cBefore he cry\u2026.\u201dBrown Black swallowed their dry saliva.\u201cHis first meal is gonna be powdered milk, next is baby food , and heat up cold baby food. The amount of snacks Seojun should eat\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey wrote it down in great detail on how to fed Seojun.Seo Eun-chan looked at his sister with tired eyes.I don\u2019t think she was this meticulous until she got married, is this the power of a mother?The next page.\u201cSeojun\u2019s favorite games and dolls\u2026\u201dSeo Eun-hye stopped talking for a while and opened her mouth again.\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to say it, do I?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t bring herself showing Kim Hee-sung\u2019s monster doll.How can she show a doll that has two heads and ugly teeth?All of Seojun\u2019s dolls have already been hidden in the back seat of their car. Except for a teddy bear.\u201cYes, we\u2019ve got toys and dolls, too!\u201dHwang Ye-joon raised his hand and said. Most of the things inside the bags were toys, dolls, and things for Seo-joon. Seo Eun-hye smiled brightly.\u201cThat\u2019s great. This is a great opportunity for Seojun to\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u2018Start liking ordinary dolls\u2026\u2026.\u2019Seo Eun-hye\u2019s voice got smaller and smaller, so they could hardly hear her last words.Lee Min-joon, who sat next to Seo Eun-hye heard her voice and nodded in agreement.Seojun, who was has his toys robbed, pouted his lips.For the next two days, he may need to give up playing his favorite toys.\u2018I\u2019m glad I have the Bear doll left!\u2019Unlike other ordinary dolls, Hee-sung\u2019s monster doll filled Seojun\u2019s soul a sense of satisfaction. So he used to feel like he couldn\u2019t live without it.\u201cHere is written how to wash him.\u201d\u201cDo we really need to wash him?\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Seo Eun-chan nodded at Choi Si-yoon\u2019s question.\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dSeo Eun-hye\u2019s explanation continued. As a result, Brown Black\u2019s complexion grew worse.They were determined, but they had a lot of do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s to follow.It just staying at home. Everything about this little baby within this 48 hours was in their hands.They had never taken care of pet before, but now they had to take care of a baby who couldn\u2019t even speak.Just thinking about it made them faint.\u201cThat\u2019s about it. What do you think? Do you think you can do it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026We\u2019ll do our best.\u201dThey couldn\u2019t bring myself to say \u2018We can do it\u2019 because they felt guilty.\u201cOkay, then. It\u2019s time for Seojun to eat. Who wants to feed him?\u201dBrown Black became stiff as rock again after what Lee Min-joon said.Seojun, who has an alarm clock in his stomach, begun to prepare himself.\u2018I\u2019ll cry in a second!\u201d\u201cYou have to feed him before he cries. You haven\u2019t even prepared the powdered milk yet, have you?\u201d\u201cMe! Me! I\u2019ll get the powdered milk!\u201d\u201cMe too! I have a thermometer!\u201dHwang Ye-joon jumped up and ran towards the kitchen. Choi Si-yoon also took a thermometer out of his luggage and followed him.Seo Eun-hye and Kim Hwa-ryeon followed them with the camera.Lee Min-joon\u2019s eyes turned toward Kevin and Park Seo-jin.They were like a mouse in front of a snake, the two men couldn\u2019t budge.\u201cThen which one of the two?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give way to the leader.\u201d\u201cI carried him earlier.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you carry Seojun, Kevin?\u201dKevin trembled with surprise at Lee Min-joon\u2019s words.\u201cCome on, Kevin.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dLee Min-joon gave Seojun to Kevin. Kevin\u2019s hands were shaking, but fortunately he was sitting down, so Seojun settled down safely between his knees.\u201cLet him lay on the side like this\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAhh-ing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf he feel uncomfortable, please put a cushion under him.\u201dSeojun\u2019s back bent in an awkward position, causing him to make a tantrum.Lee Min-joon, a competent father, quickly put the cushion from the sofa under Seojun\u2019s back as if he was already familiar with it.Seojun\u2019s expression was relieved.Seojun\u2019s posture became comfortable, but Kevin\u2019s posture was\u2026Strange.Like a doll controlled by a thread, where the joints of the arms moved differently.\u201cYou look like a puppet. Kevin.\u201d\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you put your right arm down like this?\u201dPark Seo-jin and Lee Min-joon moved Kevin\u2019s arms around, but they couldn\u2019t let him have a comfortable posture.When they moved one arm, the other arm moved by itself.\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026. What should I do?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m fine.\u201dLee Min-joon and Park Seo-jin struggled because of Kevin\u2019s uncomfortable posture, but for Kevin his arms were okay. Rather, he wanted to shake his legs, but he couldn\u2019t move because he was afraid that the baby would fall.He bit his lips nervously.\u2018I think I\u2019m going to get a cramp\u2026\u2026.\u2019Unlike the living room full of awkwardness and anxiety, inside the kitchen was calm.\u201cThis is his favorite powdered milk.\u201d\u201cI know. Elephant milk powder! I even saw the ad!\u201dHwang Ye-joon and Choi Si-yoon moved their bodies to follow Seo Eun-hye, who was busy teaching them how to prepare the powdered milk and showing where the baby bottles were.The first thing she did was to give the measurent of the powdered milk and water. After that they finished making the milk powder.Seo Eun-hye checked the temperature of the powdered milk.Choi Si-yoon, who saw Seo Eun-hye nodding, secretly checked the temperature of powdered milk with a thermometer.40 degrees!\u201cYou can make it like this later.\u201d\u201cYes, leave it to me!\u201dWhen they returned to the living room with a baby bottle, Seo Eun-cha, who was standing on one side of the living room to film, was smiling breathlessly, while Lee Min-joon and Park Seo-jin were looking at Kevin holding Seojun with an agonizing faces.\u201cThis is the best.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dPark Seo-jin shook his head at Lee Min-joon\u2019s words. They changed him many positions, but this posture was best.\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201dHwang Ye-joon, who was shaking the baby bottle to mix powdered milk, said with an absurd expression.Kevin, who didn\u2019t know where to put his arms, stretched his arms out like an armrest of a chair.Seojun was sitting in his legs, while leaning against Kevin\u2019s stomach as if he were sitting in a comfortable chair.He was in a very comfortable position where he could stretch out his two plump legs.\u201cIt\u2019s a human chair. A human chair.\u201dOthers burst into laughter at Choi Si-yoon\u2019s words.Seojun liked the soft and comfortable Kevin chair.He grabbed Kevin\u2019s arms, which were like an armrested, and moved his hips up and down.Now, eight months. Seojuon was old enough to grab something and jump up.\u201cCome on, feed him.\u201dSeo Eun-hye, who looked at the time, reminded the boys to feed Seojun quickly before he start crying.Lee Min-joon put Seojun back on the cushion. Kevin\u2019s arms moved around to create a natural posture.\u201cHere\u2019s the bottle.\u201dHwang Ye-joon, who was shaking the baby bottle hard, handed the baby bottle to Kevin.Kevin grabbed the bottle with his trembling hand and slowly put the nipples into Seojun\u2019s mouth.\u201cWoah!\u201dSqueeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze!Brown Black\u2019s eyes gathered on Seojun. Seo Eun-chan and Kim Hwa-ryeon slowly moved the camera and took a shot of the four faces.The expressions of the four, who had been at a loss and full of anxiety, slowly showed comfortable faces.The little baby was holding the bottle with his eyes closed tightly as if he were in a good mood.Brown Black slowly sat in front of Kevin, who was holding Seojun.Seojun was eating, sucking the nipples hard.Seeing him was a very strange feeling they have never felt before.Somehow they seemed to be moved.Brown Black was mesmerized and couldn\u2019t take off their eyes from Seojun.The awkward and anxious atmosphere changed naturally.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon, who were looking at the four men and the baby, stood up quietly.As Seo Eun-chan said, the couple decided to leave the house when the baby and Brown Black were off guard.Seo Eun-hye waved her hand and called Seo Eun-chan.Seo Eun-chan said with his mouth, looking at the two people standing up from their seats.\u201cAre you going now?\u201d\u2018Yes, I\u2019ve taught them everything and there\u2019s nothing more to do.\u2019\u2018My brother-in-law. Please take care of Seojun!\u2019Kim Hwa-ryeon, who was filming Brown Black, bowed her head as the couple left.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-jun also replied with a bow quietly and headed toward the front door.Seo Eun-chan\u2019s slowly closed the door, which had been slightly opened.\u201cSigh. They\u2019ll do well, right?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll do well. They have a doctor and there is have a brother-in-law.\u201d\u201cI hope so\u2026\u2026. Still\u2026\u2026.\u201d48 hours.They were a family that had never been apart this long.Her feet didn\u2019t took another step as she stood still in front of the door.Lee Min-joon already knows what was on his wife\u2019s mind. He hugged Seo Eun-hye\u2019s and looked at the tightly closed door.\u201cIt\u2019s rare for us to take a small break. Shall we use this opportunity to go on a trip?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t go far.\u201d\u201cI know. Where should we go first?\u201dA date after a long time, Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon looked at each other and smiled.* * *\u201cWow. I\u2019m done.\u201d\u201cHe eat really well.\u201dBrown Black, who were busy staring blankly at Seojun eating, came back to their senses senses when he ran out of milk powder in the bottle.Hwang Ye-joon smiled brightly and looked back.\u201cWhat do we do next..? Huh? Huh?!\u201dThey didn\u2019t see the two people they thought would stand there.Hwang Ye-joon\u2019s surprised voice also drew attention from the three people watching Seojun.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026they\u2019re gone\u2026\u2026?\u201dA quiet, calm atmosphere was what remained. Brown Black\u2019s eyes shook in anxiety.Park Seo-jin\u2019s eyes quickly looked at Seo Eun-chan holding the camera. He was so surprised that his voice didn\u2019t come out. In the end he just blushed.The other three men were at a loss. They also followed Park Seo-jin and looked at Seo Eun-chan.Seo Eun-chan with a playful smile mouthed.\u2018Brown Black and Jun\u2019s 48 hours!

He will cry if it was a minute late.\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon took out the A4 paper and wrote down Seojun\u2019s daily routine.They wrote at what time he woke up, ate, play and took a nap.\u201cThat\u2019s a very simple way to live. Seojun.\u201dSeo Eun-hye laughed at Lee Min-joon\u2019s words.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to find a time to relax, even on a simple schedule. Besides, Seo-joon seems to be tired of playing with me these days.\u201dSeo Eun-hye eyes caught the twin head ogre\u2019s head and saw Seojun playing with it by pulling each head in the opposite direction.Seojun\u2019s body flinched, but the couple didn\u2019t notice.\u2018These days, I got a little bored.\u2019Seojun, who has so many past lives, was getting tired of playing dolls every time. In addition, there were only a limited number of people he met because he was still a baby.\u201cBabies, mothers, uncles\u2026\u2026.\u2019They were enough to count with his two hands.But now new people would come tomorrow.Seojun was also excited.Yikes! He Twisted the Twin Head Ogre\u2019s head.Whether the baby\u2019s strength was weak or Kim Hee-sung made it strong, the doll did not burst a single thread.Lee Min-joon, who was taking care of Seojun while writing down some precautions, he said.\u201cUsually Idols can sing well.\u201d\u201cHmm. I heard from that Chan they had been trainees for a long time, so they have some skills atleast\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-hye recalled Seo Eun-chan\u2019s words.\u2018They\u2019re all good kids, good at singing, good at dancing, good at rapping, but I feel like they are lacking in something. They have been working hard, but I don\u2019t know\u2026 I feel like, with how they are now is not enough.\u2019Seo Eun-chan told his sister everything that he couldn\u2019t tell to the staff and the boys.\u201cHe thinks that the boys are not yet prepared for a debut. He didn\u2019t say anything because he thought it might be a bad idea. But Chan said it would be great even a small exposure about the group.\u201dCocoa Entertainment staff said they were ready. Only Seo Eun-chan felt a little uncomfortable.Lee Min-joon tilted his head.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because they don\u2019t have enough experience? They can build that up on stage after their debut.\u201d\u201cWill they?\u201d\u201cOh, I think this baby food recipe is wrong.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s true!\u201dSeo Eun-hye quickly picked up her pen. Seo Jun, who was listening to their chatter, thought.\u2018Not enough\u2026\u2019His Uncle\u2019s opinion was his own judgement, but somehow Seojun thought his opinion would be right.Seojun was lost in thought. In four-member boy band, what\u2019s missing?\u2018I hope it goes well for Uncle Chana and for mother.\u2019Seojun fell asleep while watching his mom and dad writing until late at night.When he opened his eyes, he was now in front of the Library of Life.\u201cWill another door open next year?\u201dWhat kind of book will he be able to read next to the blue door? He couldn\u2019t even remember it because there were so many books.Seojun crawled into the blue door.The library was still a mess.

Next, I will introduce the Brown Black members to Seojun, who will stay with him for the next 48 hours!\u201dHwang Ye-Joon handed over the microphone to Park Seo-jin. Park Seo-jin grabbed the microphone and waved at Seojun.The video of their introduction to be shown to viewers will be filmed separately later.\u201cHello, Seojun. My name is Park Seo-jin. I am the leader of Brown Black\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you think Seojun knows what a leader is?\u201dPark Seo-jin paused at Choi Si-yoon\u2019s words.Does he knows?

Ye-Joon!Park Seo-jin also clapped with his mouth closed.Ahem.Hwang Ye-Joon gave the microphone to Kevin.\u201cHi! I\u2019m Kevin Kim and I can speak very fast. My hometown is LA, USA, and my parents are both Korean. My favorite singer is D. Ray. My favorite food is braised ribs\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe rapper continued to talk until he finished narrating his whole life.Seojun could only recall the first 3 words. \u2018Hi!

(1 of 4)]\u201cHuh?\u201dAll the other members\u2019s eyes turned on Kevin.Kevin touch the place where Sojun slapped him, they were slightly red.The small soft baby\u2019s palm touched his cheek.Kevin smacked his cheek for a moment and grinned.\u201cSeojun seems to like me a lot.\u201dHwang Ye-joon, who was busy unpacking, quickly came to Seojun\u2019s side.\u201cSeojun. Hey. Hey, me too! Me too!\u201dWhen Hwang Ye-joon put his face near him, Seojun raised his hands again and slapped Hwang Ye-joon on the cheek.[Use of the orchestra conductor\u2019s connection. (2 of 4)]When Seojun thought he hit him harder than Kevin he clenched and straightened his fists with both slightly numb hands.It\u2019s fun.Contrary to Seojun\u2019s thoughtd, Hwang Ye-joon laughed as if he was pleased.\u201cYou like me better? Look, it\u2019s really red, right?Choi Si-yoon and Park Seo-jin also came next to Seojun\u2019s blanket and pushed their face in. They wrre like a butler waiting for a kitten to lick them.Seojun was thinking about who to slap next first with his anticipated eyes. He choose to slap Choi Si-yoon\u2019s cheek first, the one who said he would show his dance.Then, he slapped Park Seo-jin for the last.[Use of the orchestra conductor\u2019s connection. (3 of 4)][Use of the orchestra conductor\u2019s connection. (4 of 4)]\u201cHere is Seojun\u2019s like ranking!\u201dHwang Ye-joon said while looking at the camera Seo Eun-chan was holding.Whether he is actually boasting to Seo Eun-chan or to the future viewers, he smiled and raised his arms.Seo Eun-chan and Kim Hwa-ryeon, who cannot be on the screen because they are in charge of filming, looked at Seojun lying on the blanket with regretful eyes.\u201cNo.1 is me, Hwang Ye-joon!\u201d\u201cI was the first one to get hit?\u201dHwang Ye-joon snorted at Kevin\u2019s words.The redness on Kevin\u2019s face already faded. He pushed his face into the camera lens installed on the table.\u201cCome on, you see? My cheeks are still! I\u2019m redder than you because of Seojun\u2019s love, okay?\u201d\u201cNO! I\u2019m the first.\u201dPark Seo-jin, who was last hit, was speechless and frustrated, while Choi Si-yoon, the youngest, patted Seojun\u2019s stomach for choosing him before Park Seo-jin.Kevin and Hwang Ye-joon had a big fight. Then the two reached a dramatic compromise. Hwang Ye-joon and Kevin held each other\u2019s hands and did the bros signature.(The handshake between friends)\u201cThen tie for number one! Hwang Ye-joon and Kevin Kim! 3rd place, Choi Si Yoon! Park Seo-jin, 4th place!Park Seo-jin, who dreams for a plot twist outcome, looked at the two members running around with their hands raised, and said quietly.\u201cThis is just the first impression.\u201dAt Park Seo-jin\u2019s words, the members\u2019 eyes turned to him. Park Seo-jin laughed significantly.\u201cTrue love ranking should be checked on the last day.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll still be number one then!\u201d\u201cGood. This is a competition!\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m number one until the end!\u201dPark Seo-jin\u2019s request for a competition was well soughtSeojun\u2019s eyes slowly closed and lay down under the blanket. He laughed a lot. It was only a few hours, but it was fun.They were very funny people.He was also looking forward to the evening after a nap and the day after tomorrow.Things were going to be a very exciting in the next two days!\u201cOh, Seojun is sleeping.\u201dBrown Black, who were immersed in their competitiveness, quickly became quiet. Everyone sat around Sejun\u2019s blanket without making any.\u201cI think he is having fun. He keeps smiling.\u201d\u201cI know. He is so cute.\u201dBrown Black\u2019s faces were visible through his blurred vision. Numbers were rising above Brown Black, who were seating around the sides of the blanket.The two numbers were high.The number of \u201cconductor ties\u201d between Seojun and Brown Black was high, and the number of \u201cconnector ties\u201d between Brown Black was also high.It hasn\u2019t been long since they met each other, but Seojun knew how much Brown Black liked him.Besides, Brown Black seemed to be very nice.Since both ties are high, it was clear that at this rate, their skills would improve to the the maximum of 1.3 times.It\u2019s a good thing. Seojun, who confirmed their affection with his eyes, fell asleep.When he saw Seojun with his eyes closed, Brown Black looked up and looked at the clock. It was time for his nap.\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely correct.\u201dThe accuracy of Seojun\u2019s body clock and schedule reminded the members that they should follow it strictly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And from the fruit, a spirit was born.Spirits born like this become close. Fighting and reconcile, love and hate with the music they play.When their instrumental body is worn out and can no longer produce sound, it falls asleep.It was a beautiful world with music at the center of everything.He was a spirit born from the Stick baton of an orchestra conductor.Spirits in this world are born with one or two skills and used them without revealing what it is to other spirits.His skill was a great ability named [Orchestra Conductor Connection-Highest]Music skills increase by up to 10 times due to the bond between the conductor and the connected beings.The bond with the conductor and the bond between the connectors are expressed in numbers.Maximum Connection : 30The way to use the skill was simple. He just need to shake hands with someone he wanted to be connected to.Born from the baton of a conductor, he had a destiny to be a conductor from the fruit.If he used this skill, it was clear that if he connected his orchestra members to build bonds between the conductor, the members, there would be a great orchestra that had never appeared in this word before.\u2018Hmm.\u2019If it weren\u2019t for the Demon.His previous life was a Demon.Born as a descendant of the Demon king, he is the Demon Prince, who became the Demon king without any disagreement thanks to his outstanding qualities.With his reign he occupied the middle world as well as the Magic world, and invaded the heavenly world. His life in this world was unimaginably long.His memories would often disappears, but there were times when the previous life affected him until his next life.That is what happened now.He sometimes sat in a chair and looked down at his hands before conducting the orchestra.It was a clean hand.But soon his hands was soaked with blood. It was human red blood.It was monster blood.It was the golden blood of the heavenly race.His past life was full of blood and tearing people apart.He lived to massacre people, making mountains of corpses and coloring the earth and sky with darkness.He clenched his hands strong enough to break them apart.The world soon became boring.This music-filled world didn\u2019t have any bloody fight.Everywhere there was music. It started and ended with music.Spirits risked their lives on music and tried to make more beautiful and outstanding music.\u2018That\u2019s so beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u2019He laughed. He was tired of living a decent life.He wrapped his mouth with both hands in fear that his expression would be seen by anyone.\u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to play hard to get\u2019His previous life as a Demon knew how fun it was to step on the clean snow field first before it was soaked with blood.But in this life he was aiming for a music competition held once every four years in this world.Musical Contest.It was a very important festival where music was dedicated to the tree where spirits were born.At this time, the tendency of spirits to be born over the next four years changed depending on the music played to the tree.Spirits who has positive personalities since they were born, has happy music played.While, spirits with cautious personalities were born, they played serious music.Spirits who were born to sympathize with other people\u2019s sadness, they played sad music.Spirits loved all kinds of music.Ten music bands were on stage and the rankings were not much any different.Everyone enjoyed listening to music.His outstanding performance led him to perform in a music contest with his own orchestra.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m the baton spirit.\u201d\u201cOh! I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. I\u2019m the spirit of the drum spirit.\u201d\u201cHello, I\u2019m the Spirit of the Piano!\u201dHe used the Orchestra Conductor Connection-Highest level.He shook hands with the Instrumental Spirits, who played important parts from other bands.Spirits woukd have never imagined it.Any performance was fine and they don\u2019t even know how the music will affect the tree of the spirit.He grinned.[Orchestra Conductor Connection-Highest level]Music skills increase by up to 10 times due to the bond between the conductor and the connected beings.The bond with the conductor and the bond between the connectors are expressed in numbers.Maximum connection: 30\u2018Usually the bond is 0\u2026\u2026. But, what if it\u2019s negative?\u2019He focused on the \u2018increase and decrease\u2019. Increase and decrease. He was very curious about the consequences.The stage was set up in front of the tree so that the tree of the spirit could hear it.The first musical band took the stage.Among them, there was a spirit who he had shaken his hands with. A mark of his skill appeared on the head of the drum.[43 / 10]There were two numbers floating, the first being the connected instrument bond to the conductor and the latter being the bond with each of the connected instruments.The number of the connected bond to the conductor was high.Both instruments were different, but the drum really admired the famous baton spirit.The number of the bond of the drum with other instruments was low.This is because the nine music instruments knew each other only in faces and names, so they had nothing to do with bond.The drum on the stage lifted the stick.He used his skills.[Use the Orchestra Conductor Connection.]He let go any thoughts from his mind.He focused his mind to the skill. Then, a sense of contempt was revealed.The bond reacted to each other\u2019s minds. Drum\u2019s respect for him remained the same, but his contempt affected the bond. The bond between conductors, which was initially 43, gradually decreased.[The bond with the target decreased][The bond with the target decreased][The bond with the target decreased]\u2026\u2026.That\u2019s how the number on the head of the drum turned negative.Drummm (Drum rolls sound)The drum was quite famius.He was one of the best drums in the world.Drum continued to play without panicking. However, unlike his mind, his hands and feet couldn\u2019t catch the beat.When the beat of the drums at the center of the band got messed up, other instruments that tried to cover up the drum\u2019s mistakes began to go awry.Somehow the band\u2019s stage ended.The reception from the stands was not good. Everyone was worried about what was going on with the drum.Still, only one team made a mistake. The next musical troupe came up to the stage.[The bond with the target decreased][The bond with the target decreased][The bond with the target decreased]\u2026\u2026.The next music instruments made a mistake again.The next musical troupe came up. He was a famous solo singer with beautiful voice.[The bond with the target decreased][The bond with the target decreased][The bond with the target decreased]\u2026\u2026.Another made a mistake. The next musical troupe is up. It was a choir known for its solidarity more than anyone else.[The bond with the target decreased][The bond with the target decreased][The bond with the target decreased]\u2026\u2026.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dIn the stands, someone uttered a lament mixed with sadness.Nine music bands ended all the stage with mistakes.It was now the last performance.The spirits were taken aback. It was the first time since the world existed that the music instrument all made a mistake in front of the tree.What should they do?\u201cWhat happens to the spirits that would born now?\u201d\u2018Who put teams like that in a music competition?\u2019The gentle spirits were embarrassed and angry.There was a crack in the world where beautiful music flowed.The last performance.He reached out the violinist to play alone for his orchestra.The violin in a beautiful red dress blushed her cheeks and held the hands of the baton that asked her to be on the stage.She was a very grateful.\u201cThank you, Maestro.\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d[Use the Orchestra Conductor Connection.]A grim voice rang in his head as if he already knew the tragedy that would come to the world, but he still smiled cheerfully and didn\u2019t show his outrageous thoughts.He hated this boring world.On the podium, he lifted the baton he was born with all his might. Their performance has begun.He didn\u2019t hide it now. He did not hide his contempt for this boring, monotonous world, as he set off a spectacular spark till the end.The violin, which was playing solo and closest to him was the first to notice the anomaly.She was trembling within the vicious feeling she had never felt before, but she couldn\u2019t stop playing.However, contrary to her idea of enduring her fear and continuing her performance, her mind gradually lost respect for the conductor.[The bond with the target deacresed][The bond with the target decreased][The bond with the target decreased]\u2026\u2026.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u201d\u2018That\u2019s a good sound. \u2018The Demon swung his baton.As the dizzying and seemingly incorrect performance continued, not only the orchestra members but also all the spirits in the audience noticed something wrong.They realized that it was the conductor standing on the stage faults. The disrespect! His cold shoulder, laughing at the dying tree!Disdain!Finally, a sound of despair was heard from the violin.He made a mistake, but he couldn\u2019t ruin the music. The violin continued to play with tears in her eyes.Cough! Cough!It wasn\u2019t just the violin. The cello, the viola, the trumpet all shuddered and despaired.The endless collapse of music made even the spectators unable to resist themselves from crying.The beautiful, which was the background of the stage, shook. There was no wind, but the branches and leaves shook.\u201cNo, no!\u201dSitting in the stands, nine instruments who were still shock from their performance screamed looking at the tree.\u201cThe tree, the tree of spirits!\u201dThe tree is dying.There was a scream. It was a very loud scream.\u201cStop playing!\u201d\u201cNo, you can\u2019t stop!\u201dOpinions were divided among the audience. There were conflicting opinions that even if he made a mistake, he should finish it, and that they shouldn\u2019t stop even after making many mistakes.Waving the baton, he knew the answer. He stopped the baton from being the highlight.He hate them for ruining his performance. The orchestra also stopped and looked only at his baton.\u2018Oh\u2026\u2026 no\u2026\u2019There was clumsy music and full of mistakes. But if they quit halfway, it wasn\u2019t music.As the orchestra stopped playing completely, the tree of spirits gradually changed.Black. He\u2019s dying. The leaves fell one by one and the big branches fell off to the floor!Along with him, the screams of spirits and sad voices were heard everywhere.He was happy to be able to destroy one world. How the world will change now\u2026\u2026.? His heart throbbed with anticipation.Then, he heard the sound of the violin.* * *Seojun opened his eyes.\u201cDid Seojun wake up?\u201d\u201dChoi Si-yoon, who was just staring at Seojun\u2019s face next to him, smiled and said.\u201cHuwahh!\u201dHe fell asleep while reading a book from the library of life.It\u2019s a nightmare. It\u2019s a dark history. Now that he think of it, he ruined such a peaceful and beautiful world. He feel ashamed and embarrassed. Seriously, he only sighed.Kahahaha! Chaos! Destruction! Destruction! Somehow he could still hear the laughter of the evil baton spirit in his ear.That\u2019s what a chuunibyuu is? He saw it on TV\u2026\u2026. Recalling his past life, Seojun became depressed.Seo Eun-chan and Kim Hwa-ryeon, who were heating up baby food due to Seojun\u2019s crying, quickly came to the living room.\u201cWhy, why is he crying?\u201d\u201cIs Seojun okay?\u201dHwang Ye-joon and Kevin quickly sat next to the blanket. Finally, Park Seo-jin sat down, blowing the hot baby food. Kim Hwa-ryeon quietly told Seo Eun-chan, to keep filming and he was just hungry so this is normal for babies.\u201cHuwaah!\u201d\u2018Me from the stupid past!\u2019He didn\u2019t really cry, but it sounded like he was crying. The more he thought about it, the more he was embarrassed. Seojun kicked the blanket with his short legs. The small blanket was moving up and down.\u201cIs Seojun hungry?\u201d\u201cI guess so. Seo-jin. Hurry up and feed him!\u201dPark Seo-jin scooped up the baby food with a small baby spoon. Kevin quickly picked Seo-jun and put him on his lap.\u2018No, I\u2019m just sad. I\u2019m not hungry\u2026\u2026.\u2019\u201cHa-ha!\u201d\u201cSeojun is eating well!\u201d\u201cHe must have been really hungry.\u201dHe opened his mouth without realizing it. Munh muncb. The baby food in his mouth disappeared in an instant. Eating delicious food made him feel better.Seojun tilted his head and kept mumbling his mouth.Well, was he really hungry? Come to think of it, do you think his stomach was a little empty?Oh, he must have had a nightmare because he was hungry.\u201cNow. Seojun, open your mouth.\u201d\u201cMe, too! Me next!\u201d\u201cYe-Joon, I\u2019ll go next!\u201d\u201cNext up is me!\u201d[Increases bond with target][Increases bond with target][Increases bond with target][Increases bond with target]Seojun took another bite. It was very delicious because it was baby food made by his mom.* * *The Cello Spirit opened the book. It was a book about the worst traitor ever, the baton spirit.After the incident, laws were enacted to reveal the skills of each spirits and to register their skills upon birth.At the front of the book there was a hero, the violin spirit, and her skills.The violin, which defeated the traitor and revived the tree, was the cello\u2019s idol.[Basic skill with violin effort \u2013 lower level]The basic skills that put effort into it allow you to continue playing under any mistakes or unfavorable conditions.It was a skill that didn\u2019t help her improve her skills, but it helped her very much to defeat the traitor. The Cello turned to the next page.There was a picture of a violin playing with the red dress and a traitor going against all the instrument to destroy the tree.The violin went on to play even when he was full of mistakes. It was like a poor performance by a newborn spirit. Her skill, which she usually complained about being useless, shone. The uninterrupted performance continued.The baton spirit, who was trying to stop the violin, was overwhelmed by his orchestra members and could not stop playing it.The baton\u2019s skills was continued to be used, and his skills gradually deteriorated, but she also continued to play without stopping.Thanks to the five-hour-long violin performance, the tree came back to life.However, no spirits were born from the tree that came to life after his death for the next four years.Luckily, the violin miracle didn\u2019t end there. In the next music competition, more spirits were born than usual from the tree of spirits, it returned to normal thanks to her wonderful performance full of vitality.\u2026\u2026The worst traitor in history, the baton spirit, was executed for the first time since the birth of the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Brown Black finished washing him up only after fussing over him and being soaked with water.After washing Seojun they took the bed in the living room.Choi Si-yoon and Kevin brought Seojun\u2019s crib out from the master bedroom and put it on one side of the living room.Originally, they planned to sleep with the same blanket, but Choi Si-yoon opposed because of Seojun\u2019s appearance, which was smaller than they expected.\u201cWhat if we hurt him or sleep atop of him?\u201dBrown Black and Seo Eun-chan nodded and agreed to Choi Si-yoon\u2019s words.They agreed that Seojun should sleep on a the crib in the living room together with them.\u201cI\u2019m gonna go now. Call me whenever you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you for today.\u201d\u201cYou can call me at dawn. I\u2019m not worried because you took care of Seojun well and learned a lot.\u201dKim Hwa-ryeon, who got on the elevator, rubbed her stiff shoulders.Taking a leave of absence from the hospital to help them shoot for three days and two nights was also a struggle.Really, if it was not for her brother\u2026\u2026. If it weren\u2019t for the three days of chicken with pizza to ask for Kim Hwa-ryeon\u2019s help, she wouldn\u2019t have spent her precious vacation like this.\u201cWell, I think Seojun is nice and Brown Black has been studying a lot, so they are easy to work with.\u201dKim Hwa-ryeon smiled and pressed the button to the first floor.Seojun\u2019s eyes opened.Hmm. What should he do? He can\u2019t sleep.The lights in the living room were off and only the weak orange lights were on.Brown Black was changing into their pajamas and looking at Seojun with his chin tucked against the railing of the crib.Seo Eun-chan yawned silently and held up the camera.\u201cSeojun isn\u2019t sleeping yet?\u201d\u201cSi-yoon, how long has it been?\u201dWhen asked by Park Seo-jin, Si-yoon said, looking at the daily schedule and clock.\u201c30 minutes.\u201d\u201cI thought he\u2019d sleep well. Why isn\u2019t he sleeping yet?\u201dKevin tilted his head.The baby did not sleep after meal time and during nap time, he should\u2019ve been tired.\u201cWell, shall we do that?\u201d\u201cShall we?\u201dBrown Black, who was staring at each other awkwardly, nodded.They prepared something three days before the filming.\u201cWe practiced to do it at a time like this.\u201dEither they were fortunate or unfortunate, Seojun was not sleeping so they have the opportunity to show it to him.When Park Seo-jin started laughed, the rest of the members also laughed.\u2018What the hell is going on here?\u2019 (tl: me too I don\u2019t know)Seojun couldn\u2019t fall asleep easily thanks to the unusual noisy day.He\u2019s trying to sleep hard.Hmm.Seojun couldn\u2019t get out of his head the funny looks of the older brothers so he also laughed along them.\u201cHehehe.\u2019However, the older brothers were now making eye contact with Seojun with a calm face unlike before.[Increases bond with target]\u201cMm-hmm\u2013\u201dKevin and Choi Si-yoon were the first to open their mouth. A low but soft humming sound flowed into Seojun\u2019s ear.[Use of the Orchestra Conductor Connection- Lowest]Regardless of the will of conductor Seojun, the skills were triggered by the music of the connectors.On top of that, Hwang Ye-joon and Park Seo-jin\u2019s voices were combined.\u201cMom\u2019s in the shadow of the island\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you go to pick oysters\u2026\u201dBrown Black\u2019s head were shining as they sang along to the tune. Also the numbers sparkled.\u2018Huh? This is\u2026\u2026.\u2019Park Seo-jin, who was singing, flinched at his own singing, which was so different from when he usually practiced.\u2018I\u2019m singing it the same way as usual. I practiced this song dozens of times, how come\u2026 It was different from usual?\u2019Somehow, the members felt the emotions of each other, and the hearts of the Brown Black members combined while singing together.And everyone seemed to have some connection to each other.Seojun stared at the number of \u201cconnector ties\u201d rising with the beautiful sound of the song.The numbers went up.Before using this skills, Seojun was surprised to find the book of the Baton Spirit in the library. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be here.It was a skill that almost ruined a world.Even if it was originally meant for good, it should have been corrupted and turned into a skill for evil.If so, Seojun, who has a good character, could not learn the skill orchestra conductor.But there was such a book in the library. The two-way library full of books that Seojun can learn at his current age.Seojun looked back story on how it happened.The back story was written as a surprise attack to him.As soon as the orchestra conductor skill was about to degenerate into an evil skill, the Spirit Tree, which was barely breathing, squeezed out its strength to say these words.\u201c\u2018I hate sinners, but I love sinners\u2019 talent for \u2018music\u2019.\u201dThe Spirit Tree hated the Baton, a traitor, but he felt it was too bad to just throw away this skill that help others to develop the music he loved, so the Tree decided to retain it.The Tree, in his most damaged state, used its power to prevent the degeneration of the original evil skill. But the Tree did not prevent the skill to degenerate.The Tree had no choice but to look at the skill that has the its rank decreased.The connection between orchestra conductors has been lowered from the Highest to the Lowest.The increase, which was 10 times, turned 1.3 times and the number of connectors decreased from 30 to 4.Its condition that cold let him connect with other by holding hands changed to a difficult condition that requires both hands to slap the target on the cheek.The tree\u2019s fearsome love to music enabled the skill to survive with a good disposition.\u2018Tree\u2019s tenacity to music\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s scary.\u2019So the surviving skill [Orchestra conductor connection-Lowest] was used here.The tree\u2019s tenacity to music was great, but Brown Black\u2019s longing was greater.Brown Black was surprised by the sudden rise in their performance as they sang the song.The numbers above their head were shining even more.\u201cScary Group.\u201dBut the song was beautiful. Sejun closed his eyes and listened to the song under the warm blanket.The orchestra conductor connection was not just a simple skill to enhance the musical skills of the target.Based on the connection between the connectors and the conductor, their thoughts, their way of looking at music, and their thoughts of pursuing it while doing music.l become connected.Everything should be combined to improve musical skills.\u2018But it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier to bring it down. It\u2019s very easy if they have different ideas about music and different views. I was the only one who changed my mind back then, but the bond became immediately negative. It\u2019s very hard to get it up.\u2019The connection of the orchestra conductor was a double-edged sword. Seojun used orchestra conductor for the first time on Brown Black because this skills can be used in both good and bad ways depending on their efforts.\u2018I can\u2019t give it away for free!\u2019Even if they were good people now, they wouldn\u2019t know it in the future. If they ever have a bad idea, the skill will ruin them.He thought it would take months to understand and believe each other\u2019s thoughts!Brown Black only sang one song but the orchestra conductor connection can already be used.\u2018Amazing\u2026\u2019\u2018Hmmm\u2026\u2026.\u2019Seojun, who was lost in thought, slowly fell asleep.Brown Black also forgot they were singing a lullaby.After the children\u2019s song, Park Seo-jin started singing their new song without realizing it.Hwang Ye-joon, Kevin, and Choi Si-yoon also sang their part diligently.Really, it was different.Seo Eun-chan was barely holding onto the camera. It was something different from the the lullaby they had prepared.The children\u2019s song that they have been practicing hard before in the practice room, in the dorm, and in the car, saying that they would play it for Seojun. Was something that Seo Eun-chan got tired of hearing it. But the moment they sang it this time it was different.\u2018I\u2019m sure it was a normal children\u2019s song at that time\u2026\u2026.\u2019They changed. He didn\u2019t know what changed. He thought it may be the voice, the beat\u2026 but the way they were sing it was the same.Seo Eun-chan\u2019s heart fluttered when he didn\u2019t know why it changed.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dWhen Brown Black sang their song, Seo Eun-chan trembled as if he had been struck by lightning.This is it. This is it. The part they are missing with, the part they lacked of.He clenched his hand without realizing it and felt something hard.It was a camera. Surprised by the camera filming the floor, Seo Eun-chan quickly fixed how he hold the camera and filmed the four men singing with their bright smile.He hoped this beautiful song would be well recorded on camera.Brown Black looked at each other\u2019s faces. The way they smile and sing is the same as they were feeling.Excitement.Fun.Happiness.They felt the each other music as it was also their own music. Everything they were worried about seemed to have been solved.Their heart was beating nonstop and they were out of breath, but they did not dare to stop themselves.\u201cGasp-gasp!\u201dAfter singing all six songs for this album, the small concert in the middle of the night ended.Brown Black, who sang as hard as they could, collapsed in the living room floor.They are now breathing hard.\u201cWow, Crazy.\u201dHwang Ye-joon stretched himself in the floor, and open his mouth.His heart was still pounding.It was a perfect song, which he would have usually sing it in his dreams.A few minutes ago, even though it was a song he sang, his heart trembled just thinking about it.He became a singer because he wanted to sing this kind of song.Hwang Ye-joon shed a few tears.\u201cI got goosebumps.\u201dChoi Si-yoon, a dancer who somewhat lack in vocals, has sung better than before.He always liked dancing better\u2026\u2026.but\u2026\u2026. He can\u2019t believe he was able to sing this song\u2026\u2026. He got goose bumps with emotion.\u201c[Crazy. Really.]\u201dKevin took a breath.While singing the six songs, he changed all the rap parts.The lyrics were written after days of careful thing, were now vhanged to lyrics he thoughts of for 30 minutes. As he rap it no, it was much more suitable for their songs.He always felt he was below meny rappers from LA, but only today did he gain confidence.He can do more!\u201cThis is our music.\u201dPark Seo-jin, the lead vocalist, was able to feel the emotions of the members even more as he played the most parts.He thought about what kind of idol singer he would become. They struggled in many genres of songs. And now Brown Black\u2019s leader has come to a conclusion.\u201cLet\u2019s do music that tells others how we feel now.\u201d\u201cWow, man, you want to do this again?\u201dHwang Ye-joon look up and saw Park Seo-jin\u2019s face.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this twice. Seo-jin.\u201dChoi Si-yoon also straightened his stretched body as if he was prepared to dance again.\u201cMe too. My heart is still pounding\u2026\u2026.\u201dKevin said, kneading his hands on his chest.\u201cWe\u2019ve done it once, so I\u2019m sure we can do it again.\u201dThe words were kind, but Park Seo-jin\u2019s face was not.Only then did the members realize that their leader was quite Spartan when they saw his smiling face.Every upcoming practice, this scene was engraved in their head.\u201cUh, uh, Seojun is sleeping!\u201dHwang Ye-joon barely remembered Seojun with their minds still preoccupied with their performance.\u201cOh, we were singing lullaby, right?\u201dAt Hwang Ye-joon\u2019s words, Brown Black returned to themselves and quietly flocked to the crib.\u201c\u2026\u2026our song. Isn\u2019t it EDM?\u201d\u201cIt must have been very loud.\u201d\u201cHe is sleeping well.\u201d\u201cSeojun is cute.\u201dSeojun was sleeping well among the noisy idol songs.* * *\u201cWow\u2026 who is it?\u201dSeojun\u2019s downstairs neighbor admired the music just now. He opened the window to ventilate, but he heard the song from the people upstairs.It seemed to be an idol song because it was upbeat and has rap.He had to go to work early tomorrow morning, so he was already annoyed and thought he would need to scream at the noise but he changed his mind when he started appreciating the song.\u201cShall I go up and ask what song was that?\u201dThe song was so good. In the middle of winter, he was now crouching on the veranda listening to music for almost half an hour amidst the blazing cold wind.\u201cIt didn\u2019t even show up on my cell phone\u2026\u2026. Is this an indie song?\u201dThe ma was looking searching which song was it by typing words he heard from the song.\u201cI can\u2019t find it,\u201d he sneezed loudly.\u201cOh, I hope I don\u2019t catch a cold!\u201dHe remained in the open for another 10 minutes because he wanted to hear more about the song, but they didn\u2019t sing anymore.\u201cArgh! I should go to bed.\u201dThe man closed the window tightly as soon as he entered back his apartment.It wasn\u2019t just him. All the neighbors of Sejun\u2019s were busy figuring out the singer of the song they heard from somewhere for 30 minutes.But it was impossible to find Brown Black, who hadn\u2019t even made their debut yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What are they doing without me? Something fun?\u201cSeojun, look at this. It\u2019s so high!\u201dChoi Si-yoon eagerly turned his eyes to Seojun. He played the role of taking care of Seojun until he was ready.Choi Si-yoon built wooden blocks with his unique balancing ability. Seojun\u2019s head turned toward the block that Choi Si-yoon built.\u201cHuh!\u201dIt\u2019s so high!A wooden block stood like a little stood a bit far from Seojun.As Seojun crawled towards it, Choi Si-yoon quickly blocked the front.Each of the block were quite sturdy, so if they collapsed onto Seojun collapsed, it would be a major accident.\u201cSeo, Seojun. Watch it from here. Don\u2019t touch it!\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dWhen Seojun went towards left, Choi Si-yoon quickly turned left.

Choi Si-yoon was a beat late due to Seojun\u2019s fake move.\u201cSeojun?!\u201dSeojun, who was crawling hard to the right, stopped at Choi Si-yoon\u2019s cry.He turned his head towards him and smiled broadly at Choi Si-yoon, grabbed the drawer next to the block, and tightened his hands.He pushed his hips, legs, and feet together. He stood in place.\u201cWow!\u201dThe wooden block tower was taller than Seojun even though he was standing up. Seojun even raised his head and looked at him.Choi Si-yoon, who had no idea what to do, breathed a sigh of relief and carried Seojun.\u201cDid you want to stand up?\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s talk!\u201dSeojun turned his head and looked at Choi Si-yoon with a sad look.Choi Si-yoon coughed in embarrassment.\u2018Oh, right.

The wooden block settled stably on the top.\u201cSeojun, let\u2019s do this time.\u201dChoi Si-yoon handed Seojun the smallest square block.Seojun looked at a small block and reached for the block tower.Choi Si-yoon, who was holding Seojun, slowly walked in front of the block tower.\u201cUgh.\u201dSeojun slowly reached out. Place a small hand on a wooden block and slowly spread his finger.The block of wood fell from his palm.

Seojun is the greatest!\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dThe block tower, which was about to fall, stopped.The Tower, which was built at a nice angle, gives the feeling of unstable but it was great just to put the block on here.\u201cSeojun is a genius!\u201d\u201cHehehe!\u201dChoi Si-yoon lifted Seojun up.When Seojun laughed, Hwang Ye-joon and Kevin came out from the kitchen.Hwang Ye-joon was sweating a little bit and Kevin was holding a knife in one hand.\u201cHey, the knife!\u201d\u201cOh, sorry!\u201dSeeing the knife, Choi Si-yoon shouted, Kevin quickly went back in.Perhaps after hearing Choi Si-yoon\u2019s shout, Park Seo-jin was nagging at Kevin.Hwang Ye-joon wiped the sweat off his face with a handkerchief. As Hwang Ye-joon tried to approach, Choi Si-yoon hugged Seojun and stepped back.Hwang Ye-joon opened his eyes wide.\u201cWhat, why are you avoiding me?\u201d\u201cSeojun, he\u2019s dirty.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s done\u2014the handkerchief is clean, too!\u201d\u201cHey, hey, hey, hey!\u201cYes, I do!\u201dSeojun laughed hard at Hwang Ye-joon\u2019s mournful expression.

It was louder than before, so Park Seo-jin and Kim Hwa-ryeon, who were in the kitchen, came out. Seo Eun-chan, who had been filming in the living room, was giggling.Surprised by the loud noise, Hwang Ye-jun stopped his hand. It was just before he touched the wooden block at the top.Hwang Ye-joon\u2019s eyes looked at Park Seo-jin and wondered what this situation was. Quick-witted Kevin took a step back.\u201cWhy? Why? Did I do something wrong?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what Seojun built! He work hard to built that?\u201cAbu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!\u201dSeojun became talkative.

Kevin put his hands together politely.If he did something wrong, he would have ended like Hwang Ye-joon.\u201cCome on, Seojun. Ye-Joon is sorry, so let\u2019s forgive him. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t touch the block, did I?\u201dAt Park Seo-jin\u2019s words, Seo-joon looked at Hwang Ye-joon, who was praying in front of him. Hwang Ye-joon begged to the point where he had a fever in his palm.\u2018No choice then! I\u2019ll let you off the hook!\u2019\u201cWoo-ong!\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.

Seojun also laughed amidst the arms of Hwang Ye-joon, who was moving in a funny way.\u201cCome on, stop it. Seojun will get motion sickness.\u201dSeo Eun-chan stepped in. Hwang Ye-joon, who was shaking Seojun hard, came to his senses and stopped. Seojun hit Hwang Ye-joon\u2019s arm, asking for another one.\u201cSeojun, let\u2019s eat.\u201dSeojun\u2019s head turned at Park Seo-jin\u2019s words. \u2018Oh, come to think of it, it was time to eat soon. I was a little hungry.\u2019\u201cWoo-ong!\u201d\u201cWe prepared a special meal for Sejun!\u201dEveryone headed to the kitchen.There were bowls of chopped ingredients on the table. Park Seo-jin followed Dr. Kim Hwa-ryeon\u2019s suggestions about the ingredients.Finely ground beef and beef soup, spinach, blue, mushrooms, potatoes, yolk, sweet potatoes, sweet pumpkin, and dried pollack were finely cut.Hwang Ye-Joon, who put Seojun in a baby chair, pretended to wipe off his sweat.\u201cIt was hard to make beef broth. I had to boil sweet potatoes and sweet pumpkin and blanch vegetables.\u201d\u201cIt was hard to cut.\u201dKevin nodded at Park Seo-jin\u2019s words. Choi Si-Yoon, who didn\u2019t know the situation because he was playing with Seojun, was surprised to see the ingredients on the table.\u201cAre you going to use all of this? How many minutes is it going to take?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to choose what Seojun wants to eat here. If you want to boil it in a pot and make it into porridge, you have to decide quickly.\u201dBrown Black\u2019s eyes turned to the clock. Everyone was nervous about the time to feed the baby was fast approaching.\u201cHello, viewers. From now on, we would be eating with Jun! Let\u2019s get started. Today\u2019s baby food will be made with the ingredients on the table. It would be at random!\u201d Hwang Ye-joon said while looking at the camera Seo Eun-chan was holding.When Brown Black clapped, Seojun clapped his hand too!\u201cI can\u2019t wait to taste how delicious baby food will be! For your information, the doctor will informs us what to let him try with any combination of ingredients. If it is good, we\u2019ll feed it to Seojun. Don\u2019t worry, Seojun taste buds will be safe!\u201d\u201cPlease be a delicious baby food.\u201dKevin prayed at Hwang Ye-jun\u2019s last words. Seojun\u2019s tongue will be safe, but ours will be in dangerous, right? Brown Black\u2019s eyes grew dim.\u201cWell, let\u2019s get started, shall we?\u201dPark Seo-jin carefully took Seojun from the baby chair, held him in his arms and made eye contact.\u201cSeojun.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cPick something that looks delicious here. What do you think looks good?\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes were on where Park Seo-jin was pointing at. Colorful things were on the bowl.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u2018Well\u2026 What would be good?\u2019Seojun thought hard.First, he chose the ingredients in baby food that he often eat. Seojun pointed on the ground beef.\u201cHe chose beef first!\u201d\u201cMeat is delicious.\u201dHwang Ye-joon was commenting in real time together with.Hearing his words, Choi Si-Yoon tilted his head and tapped him on his shoulder, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019\u2018This is the first one. How many times is Seojun going to pick baby food?\u2019\u2018Uh\u2026\u2026. I don\u2019t know?\u2019It\u2019s settled.Choi Si-yoon and Hwang Ye-joon were in an awkward position. Seojun continued to point to any bowl with his fingers.\u2018It looks delicious because it\u2019s yellow. It\u2019s green, so I think it\u2019ll taste good! It\u2019s white. It looks delicious! This, this, this!\u2019It was so finely cut that Seojun didn\u2019t even know what the raw ingredients were, so he chose the ingredients that looked delicious without any hesitation.\u201cHe choose the yolk, spinach, mushrooms, no, wait, how many will Seojun choose?\u201d\u201cYay!\u201d\u201cHe is done!\u201dOh, a sigh came out from Brown Black\u2019s mouth. Seojun laughed in high spirits.\u2018I\u2019m done!\u2019\u201cHe really picked everything\u2026\u2026.\u201dBrown Black was speechless at Seojun\u2019s brutality, he chose all the ingredients on the table.\u201cHehehe.\u201d\u201cSeojun, tell me honestly. You did this on purpose because you knew we were going to eat them, right? You picked everything, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThis can\u2019t be delicious, bros.\u201dHwang Ye-joon whined in front of Seojun, who was within Park Seo-jin\u2019s arms.Choi Si-yoon was checking the ingredients roughly and looked for the two cameramen to seek help.Kim Hwa-ryeon, who was holding a camera from afar, also drew an X with her arm.\u201cYou are right. This is a baby food that even the doctor opposed to let him eat it!\u201d\u201cBut we should still eat them, right?\u201d\u201cIs this a punishment food?\u201dBrown Black was discouraged but put Seojun in a baby chair and brought a pot.\u201cSeojun can use the leftover as a baby food ingredient, so let\u2019s put it in moderation.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEveryone took a spoonful and put the ingredients into the pot.\u201cUh. I don\u2019t like mushrooms\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. Take this opportunity to fix your picky diet.\u201d\u201cHow much broth do you want?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it taste good if it was seasoned well?\u201dHwang Ye-joon put a spoonful of mushrooms with a disgusted face. So all the ingredients went into the pot.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s boil it.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to eat, so put salt\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-chan stirred his arms at Choi Si-yoon\u2019s words as If saying:\u2018You can\u2019t do that! It\u2019s baby food!\u2019\u201c\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t, can I?\u201d\u201cNo, you can\u2019t\u2026\u2026.\u201dHwang Ye-joon turned on the gas. And started boiling the ingredients. Park Seo-jin heated up the baby food Seo Eun-Hye prepared.\u201cSeojun, will stay safe and eat delicious baby food.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u2018Aren\u2019t I supposed to eat that? I chose it because it was pretty so, I\u2019m not going to eat?\u2019Ding-dong \u2013 As always, the alarm went off and Seojun put baby food in his mouth.Yum! Yummy!Seojun was enjoying his mom\u2019s baby food when the gas stove turned off.Seojun\u2019s random baby food has been completed.\u201cIt\u2019s all set.\u201d\u201cDid Seojun\u2019s even pick any food?\u201d\u201cHe did pick. All of them.\u201d\u201cOh. Quite disgusting\u2026\u2026.\u201dBrown black looked at the disgusting paste in the pot.Seo Eun-chan pushed the camera into the pot.\u2018Well, I\u2019ll have to mosaic it later.\u2019\u201cWhat\u2019s this color? It\u2019s got fine materials in it\u2026 But\u2026 What is it this color?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s all in.\u201d\u201cAre we really eating it?\u201d\u201cWhat a waste.\u201dBrown Black all picked up a spoon. Hwang Ye-joon tried to eat as little as possible while holding back his tears, but Park Seo-jin kindly gave him a spoonful instead.\u201cOn the count of three, we eat?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dBrown Black gulped his saliva. Seojun, who was biting a baby spoon, also saw his older brothers.\u2018What\u2019s that weird color? That\u2019s the kind of thing is not good!\u2019\u201cOne.\u201d\u201cTwo.\u201d\u201cThree!\u201dBrown Black\u2019s mouth contained Lee Seo-joon\u2019s random picked baby food!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He woke up early in the morning, played as much as he could, ate delicious baby food, and took a nap, but the sun was high.Along with Kim Hwa-ryeon, Brown Black decided to go to the apartment playground.\u201cSeojun, have you been to a playground?\u201d\u201cAbu!\u201d\u201cI went there with my mom for a walk. I couldn\u2019t even walk, so I couldn\u2019t ride any rides.\u201d\u201cToday I\u2019ll show you my dancing.\u201d Choi Si-yoon said with smile.With last night\u2019s influence seemed to remain, somehowge wanted to dance right away, so his feet didn\u2019t stay still for even a moment.Everyone went to the playground with powdered milk, diapers and thick blankets for Seojun.It was a cold winter, but the playground was atill full of children. Laughter was heard as the children ran around.\u201cWhen will our Seojun start running around?\u201dSeo Eun-chan uttered as he watched the children running wild. Kim Hwa-ryeon, who heard it closely, shook off the dust on the bench and said.\u201cHe\u2019ll be running around in no time. Children grow up in the blink of an eye.\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201dSeojjn was staring at the playground while being in Hwang Ye-joon\u2019s arms. He was so cute to see him wearing a rabbit fur hat.\u201cAs expected, I\u2019m good at choosing clothes.\u201dHwang Ye-joon lightly pressed Seo-joon\u2019s cheek with his finger.The rabbit hat he bought looked so good on Seojun.\u201cSo cute. Seojun.\u201dKevin pressed the handle of the rabbit hat and the rabbit\u2019s ears stood up. The other side was pressed alternately, and the other rabbit\u2019s ears stood up. Hwang Ye-joon and Kevin smiled at the rabbit ears standing.\u201cSeojun is a rabbit. Rabbit.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201d\u201cCome on, Seojun, sit here.\u201dBefore they knew it, Park Seo-jin, who safely put Seojun in a baby chair near the bench chair, called Seojun.They were in a corner where there were not many people around this part of the playground.It was a shady place because of the lack of sunlight, so they wrapped Seojun\u2019s body with a blanket.\u201cHe is like a Snowbaby!\u201d (TL: Snow man but changed the man to baby)\u2018This is frustrating, but it\u2019s warm!\u2019Seo Eun-chan and Kim Hwa-ryeon, who were holding the cameras, sat next to Seojun, thE snowbaby wrapped with blankets.Kim Hwa-ryeon shot Seojun and Seo Eun-chan shot Brown Black.Brown Black stood in search of an open space.Brown Black were not disappointed to see that their first stage was not a spectacular one, but just a simple corner of the playground.Rather, their hearts beat so fast that they felt like they were going to stop breathing.There was a simple audience, not the company staff who would always watched their practice. Seojun, who was sitting in the baby chair and looking at them.\u2018What are they going to do?\u2019Brown Black\u2019s head glistened. The number of glow grew higher and higher.It was the same as last night.Seo Eun-chan wish that he had a better camera and a better recording machine! It was a pity.Leader Park Seo-jin raised his voice.\u201cHello, viewers. Hello, Seojun!\u201d\u201cAbububu!\u201d\u2018Hey Guys!\u2019Seojun smiled broadly.Whatever happens, he will do it!Brown Black smiled brightly and bowed down.\u201cFrom now on, Brown Black will perform. Listen to me, everybody!\u201dWhen Choi Si-yoon, who was closest, ran quickly and played music from his cell phone, music flowed to the two Bluetooth speakers on both sides of the bench chair. This was a public place, so they could hear several noises overlapping.When Park Seo-jin opened his mouth, the noise seemed to have disappeared leaving only their music.[The orchestra conductor connection is triggered]\u2018I knew it.\u2019Seojun nodded. It\u2019s not a skill that could be often used, but these guys used it too easily.Seojun leaned his back on the stroller and listened to the song.Even now, if they continue to trust each other and study music for a long time to improve their basic skills, he could look forward to what Brown Black would do in the future.-It\u2019s only one step.Hwang Ye-jun\u2019s mouth opened and a friendly voice could be heard. Choi Si-yoon came forward.The Orchestra Conductors Conection only increased musical ability. There was no effect on the ability of dancing.However, Choi Si-yoon felt the rhythm and beat of the song with his whole body.Choi Si-yoon, who felt that for sure, moved more intensely than usual.Three people moved their bodies guided by the intense choreography of Choi Si-yoon.Seojun\u2019s eyes grew bigger in the endless colorful dance. It was different from the usual dance he saw on TV. The stage right in front of him that he felt was full of unique vividness.Four people danced to the music. It was amazing. He could feel the members\u2019 hearts like last night.It was a familiar dance, but today their fingertips and toes were more tightly matched.It was so much fun how they sang, danced and smiled brightly.The Four people\u2019s dance was more perfect than ever. Seo Eun-chan clenched his fist.Last night, it wasn\u2019t just a fluke.Yesterday\u2019s happening is also here today.\u201cThis is going to be a success!\u201d\u2019Seo Eun-chan got up without realizing it. Instead of sitting still, he wanted to take a closer picture of his cool idols.\u201cWow\u2026\u2026\u201dKim Hwa-ryeon, who returned home last night, turned the camera that was filming Seojun to Brown Black without realizing it.She didn\u2019t expect it because she knows it was the first idol group from a new entertainment, but it was more than she could imagine.It\u2019s her first time hearing the song, and the lyrics were stuck in her ears and the colorful group dance delighted her eyes.\u2018It\u2019s just the beginning!\u2019The song, which lasted for about four minutes, was now over. Brown Black bowed to the camera filming them.\u201cGasp, thank you!\u201dExhausted, Brown Black sat on the ground in front of Seojun. Seo Eun-chan handed them a bottled water bottle with a strange face.\u201cWeren\u2019t we supposed to do two more songs?\u201d\u201cOh, no. Heck \u2013 it was so hard\u2026\u2026.\u201dHwang Ye-jun, who drank water without breathing, shook his hand.The other three also nodded.Park Seo-jin washed his face with a completely exhausted face.\u201cWe sang all the songs yesterday, but I feel like I\u2019m going to die because I\u2019m dancing.\u201d\u201cI know. Wow, how did we sing it all yesterday?\u201d\u2018It\u2019s because of me, right?\u2019Seojun wanted to reach out his hands and pat the older brothers, but he couldn\u2019t move because his arms were wrapped tightly in a blanket. Only his fingers wiggled.The Skill wasn\u2019t used for nothing. Mana was used as a base, but if Mana was not there, they had to pay for it with their own physical strength.Yesterday, Seojun and Brown Black were close to each othdr, so they replaced Seojun\u2019s mana half way with their physical strength, but now their distance was far away.Today, on the stage ahead, it was entirely done by Brown Black.Kevin, who sat on the dirt floor and breathed a few times, laughed.\u201cI need to work out.\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll arrange you to a gym. I need you to increase your stamina for the concert.\u201dAt Seo Eun-chan\u2019s words, Brown Black\u2019s face, who was sitting on the floor, were all speechless.It was a far-fetched word from his imagination. Choi Si-yoon asked back with a puzzled face.\u201cCo, Concert?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeo Eun-chan smiled brightly.\u201cYou guys are awesome! If you debut like this, we might have a concert within a year!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dBrown Black put on excited look on their faces. They were eliminated from various agencies. Their debut was canceled and their schedule was constantly postponed, saying there was always something missing on them.But they can\u2019t believe they were going to have a concert.They just thought they did better than usual, singing and dancing.It was a heartbreaking song they sang last night and a dance that couldn\u2019t have been more perfect.They thought it would be a great debut stage if they did this on a music show.\u201cI think so, too.\u201dIt was Kim Hwa-ryeon. Unlike her usual calm face just now, her face was very bright.\u201cWow. Why didn\u2019t you debut until now? You sang and danced so well! Here, look. I got goosebumps, right? It was amazing.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dBrown Black was at a loss for compliments from Kim Hwa-ryeon.It was then.\u201cExcuse me!\u201dA man called them. The friendly atmosphere subsided in an instantaneously.Is this a civil complaint? Seo Eun-chan jumped up and ran to the man\u2019s front. Was it loud? Seo Eun-chan bit his lips. Even before their debut, he could not ruin Brown Black\u2019s image.\u201cSorry\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the title of the song?\u201d\u201cWe will accept any complains\u2026Yes?\u201dThe man who came to pick up the documents he had left behind, rushed to hear their song and laughed awkwardly.\u201cNo matter how many times I searched, I couldn\u2019t find the title of the song or the singer\u2019s name. You sang several songs last night, but only one today.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026Uh\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dBrown Black and Kim Hwa-ryeon\u2019s eyes, who were holding their breath with nervousness, grew. Seo Eun-chan and Brown Black both lost their words when asked by a sudden man.The man who asked the question was embarrassed, because there was no words from then. There was only silence.Everyone seemed to be out of their minds.\u201cAbububu!\u201dThis is when Seojun supposed to step up. \u2018What\u2019s with this atmosphere?\u2019The baby\u2019s laughter broke the silence because he knew nothing.Surprised, Seo Eun-chan replied quickly.\u201cOh, yes! The song is called \u2018Start.\u2019 And the singer\u2019s name is, uh. Wait a minute.\u201dSeo Eun-chan beckoned looking at the back. Brown Black, who flinched, quickly ran to Seo Eun-chan. Greetings. Greetings. Seo Eunchan whispered.\u201cOh, hello, we are Brown Black!\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s Brown Black. Thank you. You were a great singer. Also great dancer.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t search for songs\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-chan replied quickly.\u201cThey haven\u2019t made debut yet.\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes got bigger. Oh, so the man who searched music sites all night and even posted questions felt better when he found the answer.\u201cI hope you make your debut soon. Please sing a lot of good songs.\u201dThe man took the paper out of the bag with a smile. A pen came out of his pocket. Picked out the paper and pen to Brown Black.They didn\u2019t know what it meant, so Brown Black just stood there blankly. Seo Eun-chan stabbed Kevin in the ribs.\u201cSign, sign.\u201d\u201cGasp!\u201dHwang Ye-jun\u2019s breath stopped. Park Seo-jin\u2019s hands were trembling but still grabbed the paper and pen.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, please.\u201d\u201cNo, excuse me.\u201dMeanwhile, Choi Si-yoon, who had difficulty breathing, signed a paper.As they continued to sign, Kim Hwa-ryeon carried Seojun and headed to them.\u201cAbububu.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re a baby.\u201d\u201cYes, we\u2019re filming an entertainment show on YouTube. If you have time, please watch it. This is our YouTube channel.\u201dThe autograph ended while Seo Eun-chan and the man continued their conversation. The man smiled brightly at the sign.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely buy it when the album comes out.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dBrown Black and Seo Eun-chan bowed. The man also greeted back and left.Brown Black was only looking at the back of the man walking in the distance.\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dThey were tearing up.Kevin bit his lips. He felt hot inside. It was so hot that he almost cried. Choi Si-yoon, the youngest, was already crying. Tears fell down without a sound.Hwang Ye-joon and Park Seo-jin opened their mouths with their eyes full of tears. They couldn\u2019t speak at all, so they shut up.\u201cWell done!\u201dSeo Eun-chan, who was able to speak at least, tapped Brown Black on their shoulders. He kept saying \u2018good job\u2019 because he couldn\u2019t control his overwhelmed emotions. He constantly repeated, \u2018Good job.\u2019Kim Hwa-ryeon, who careied Seojun skillfully with one hand, held the camera.She sniffed, too.\u201cAbububu.\u201dSeojun, who couldn\u2019t cry by himself, smiled broadly.Brown Black\u2019s eyes turned to the baby. Looking at his bright smile.\u201cHuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh.\u201d\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard someone complimenting us!\u201d\u201c[He\u2019s buying an album! They want us to sing more!]\u201cHuhuhu. We are a good dancer!\u201dStarting with Hwang Ye-joon, everyone burst into tears. They hugged each other and cried with a little baby in the middle.Seojun wanted to stand their hugging, but\u2026\u2026.\u2018You make me want to cry!\u2019\u201cUwaaahh!\u201dSeojun burst into tears. Seo Eun-chan wiped away his tears and Kim Hwa-ryeon took out a handkerchief.It was a good day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was because the main characters and other characters were not human, but animals such as pigs, dogs, and tigers, or sometimes came out as plants, which made him feel nostalgic.\u201cAbububu!\u201dSeojun shouted with his high-pitched voice and clapped his hands.Seojun\u2019s response ended the narration of the fairy tale.Hwang Ye-joon smiled brightly as he closed the book.\u201cIt was worth practicing because Seojun likes it!\u201d~~Alarm~~\u201cOh, Seojun needs to eat and take a nap after.\u201dWhen the alarm went off, Choi Si-yoon, who was dozing off on the sofa, jumped up and said.Choi Si-yoon gradually closed his eyes again as he danced hard, cried, washed, and listened to the fairy tales quietly. Kevin yawned loudly, too.\u201cWell.\u201dPark Seo-jin agonized over the condition of the members.In his hand, there was a bottle of milk powder at just the right temperature.He has now gotten better after 2 days.\u201cSince Seojun takes a nap after eating, shall we also take a nap?\u201d\u201cAll right!\u201d\u201cAgreed!\u201d\u201cUnfold the blankets.\u201dKevin quickly stood up and spread Seojun\u2019s and the members\u2019 blankets in the living room.Park Seo-jin passed the nipples on Seojun\u2019s mouth.Seojun\u2019s eyes closed in a half-moon when the powdered milk that came in his mouth without missing the right timing. Other members also huddled in front of Seojun.\u201cAigoo.\u201d\u201cOh, Seojun is so cute.\u201d\u201cI think he is the cutest when he eat.\u201dSeo Eun-chan quickly brought the camera and took a close shot. Seo Eun-chan, whose eyes met Seojun on the camera screen, grabbed his chest. How can he be such a fool to be a nephew?The nap was short but sweet. Brown Black and Seojun, who woke up after a good sleep, were full of energy all over their bodies.Park Seo-jin played touch games with glutinous rice powder and seaweed, and Seojun\u2019s bath, which became a mess after playing games, quickly ended with the brilliant teamwork of Brown Black, who studied through YouTube videos all night.The fun time passed in an instant. It was already his second night with the older brothers.\u201cRound eyes, black little nose\u2026\u201d\u201cWearing black fur\u2026\u201d\u2018Why sing lullabies when you can sing your songs?\u2019 Seojun thought, while lying on the cozy blanket.He could see Brown Black poking his face over the crib and looking at him just like yesterday.Seeing everyone smiling and singing children\u2019s songs, he didn\u2019t think he was wrong.\u201cPretty baby bear.\u201d[The Orchestra conductor connection is triggered]\u2018Their singing skills have improved 0.3 times in a day or two.\u2019Sigh.But today, they didn\u2019t sing all six songs that will be included in Brown Black\u2019s album like yesterday. The calm nursery rhymes that Brown Black has been practicing continued.Seojun soon fell asleep.The man downstairs, who opened the window and waited for a song to be heard somewhere in the cold wind, but the night passed by without Brown Black and Seojun know about this.* * *The morning has come. It was a bit gloomy, unlike yesterday, when it was lively.Brown Black did a perfect job with their slightly dark look on his face.Seojun took a nap after drinking powdered milk and playing as usual. And he ate baby food and had fun. The time passed by very fast.\u201cThis is the last time I\u2019m preparing powdered milk, Ye-joon.\u201dChoi Si-yoon, who was preparing the powdered milk, opened his mouth without realizing it.\u201cDon\u2019t say that. It\u2019s just sad.\u201dHwang Ye-joon, who was holding Seojun, said. Seojun, who was staring at Choi Si-yoon with his chin on Hwang Ye-jun\u2019s shoulder, cried.Ding dong-\u201cIt\u2019s time!\u201dWhen Seojun\u2019s alarm and cell phone alarm went off, Choi Si-yoon quickly checked the temperature and passed on the nipples to Seojun\u2019s mouth.Chomp Choop.Hwang Ye-joon went to the living room with Seojun in his arms so that Seojun could eat well.\u201cNow we are done decorating the Christmas tree.\u201dPark Seo-jin and Kevin were neatly displaying the items to decorate the Christmas tree in the living room.The two were sighing at glittering light bulbs on the floor, and also sighing with a small doll on the floor to decorate.\u201cIs that going to blow the ground up?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a shame for the older brothers.\u201dPark Seo-jin saw Seojun enjoying powdered milk.\u201cAt first I was at a loss\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, changing diapers was very difficult.\u201d\u201cChanging diapers is still hard.\u201d\u201cHis parents are amazing.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u2019Seojun smiled as if he was embarrassed by the eyes of his older brothers staring at him. Now Brown Black did not felt awkward anymore and we\u2019re wearing gentle smiles.Hwang Ye-joon recalled themselves from two days ago. Due to the baby\u2019s laugh, they made a fuss, and tearfully look at the doctor.\u201cIt\u2019s like 48 hours flew by in a blink of an eye.\u201dPark Seo-jin, who had been studying singing and dancing practice for three days, put his index finger inside Seojun\u2019s small palm. Reflectively, Seojun held Park Seo-jin\u2019s index finger tightly.\u201cAt first, I thought it was just a shoot to make our name known\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey felt like a real family before they knew it.Choi Si-yoon was looking at Seojun with his eyes full of tears.Thanks to this little baby, their singing and dancing skills seemed to have improved.\u201cI think we made a lot of happy memories.\u201dKevin swept Seojun\u2019s hair gently. It was a noisy and happy non-daily life different from the life that was full of practice, practice, and practice.\u201cI think I\u2019ll feel empty when I get home.\u201dEveryone laughed at Kevin\u2019s words and agreed with him.\u201cI know it\u2019s empty, but we\u2019ll be busy. We have to go on a music show in a month.\u201dSeo Eun-chan, who was writing something on paper in the corner of the living room, said.Brown Black nodded at those words.Seojun, who was enjoying powdered milk while listening to Brown Black\u2019s conversation, held the empty bottle for a while and let it go.\u201cOops!\u201dPark Seo-jin caught the empty bottle at once before it even fell on the floor of the living room.\u201cHahaha.\u201d\u201cGood catch, leader?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t miss it when he drop it.\u201dBoth Seojun and Brown Black smiled brightly as they seemed to show more familiarity in just 48 hours of being together.\u201cNow, turn off the light.\u201dThey closed all the curtains in the living room and made it dark.The bright living room became as dark as night.The blackout curtains that Park Seo-jin brought played a part.Hwang Ye-joon lifted a heavy blackout curtain with an absurd look.\u201cWhy did you bring many?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better to have enough than not enough.\u201dLater, Park Seo-jin\u2019s quote \u2018It\u2019s better to have enough than not enough\u2019, not knowing it right now, would have this caption every time he appeared on entertainment shows.\u201cSeojun, turn on the switch!\u201dLooking at the Christmas tree on one side of the living room, Seojun\u2019s small hand, sitting on Choi Si-yoon\u2019s lap, grabbed the colorful switch of the light bulb.Choi Si-yoon\u2019s hands were overlapped with Seojun\u2019s.Seojun, who had been looking at the Christmas tree with an expression of \u2018What are they doing?\u2019, tilted his head.They put dolls on trees, stars, beads, and now put out the lights without having time to look at the decorated trees.In addition, the sunlight from the window was blocked with curtains.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cCome on, Seojun. Take a good look.\u201dHwang Ye-joon, who sat next to Choi Si-yoon, took Seojun, who was in between Choi Si-yoon\u2019s arms.Park Seo-jin and Kevin also sat next to Choi Si-yoon.Sitting in a dark living room with no light, everyone looked at the Christmas tree.\u201cThree!\u201d\u201cTwo!\u201d\u201cOne!\u201dChoi Si-yoon turned on the switch. Seojun\u2019s fingers moved together.Click!Twinkle!The tree glittered. It glittered with red, blue, green, and yellow lights.Seojun looked at the tree in surprise. The yellow star at the top of the tree twirled and shone!The beads, which were not visible at all, sparkled under the light of the little bulbs surrounding the tree. Decorated dolls were also very visible.\u201cHuh?\u201dWhat\u2019s this?The click came on and the light came on. It was not a white light like a living room light, but a colorful light.Seojun couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the splendidly shining tree.\u2018It\u2019s pretty! It\u2019s really pretty!\u2019\u201cSeojun, merry Christmas!\u201d\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201dThis was early Christmas.Everyone hurled and clapped their hands. Seojun, who was looking at the tree in a stupor, clapped his hands together when all the older brothers clapped their hands.\u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean, but it\u2019s awesome! It\u2019s the best!\u2019\u201cHahaha.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty, Seojun?\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201dSeojun, who was shaking his hips while looking at the flashing tree, saw a strange switch between Choi Si-yoon and his hands.\u2018What will happen if I click on this?\u2019Seojun gave strength to his hands. While Choi Si-yoon was doing something.At once, the living room became dark.\u201cWhat, what?!\u201d\u201cSI-YOON?\u201d\u201cNo, not me! Seojun!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSeojun, who was filled with mischief at the sight of his older brothers surprised, smiled and tightened his grip.Click!The tree is lit up again. The colorful lights were dancing again.Brown Black\u2019s eyes were all on Seojun, who was sitting on Choi Si-yoon\u2019s lap.Seojun smiled cutely. Brown Black laughed at him unconsciously.Click!It\u2019s dark again.Click!The lights came on like a flash of light.\u201cOh, my. Seojun. Let\u2019s stop.\u201d\u201cNo more!\u201d\u201cCurtain, open the curtain!\u201dKevin opened the curtain wide. Bright sunlight came in.It was winter, but it was bright in the middle of the day.No matter how many times he clicked the switch, the sunlight was too bright to change the atmosphere dramatically.Seo-joon, who looked sad, lifted the switch. \u2018Please turn this on.\u2019His eyes were sparkling. Brown Black struggled to turn their eyes away. Hwang Ye-joon and Kevin whispered quietly.\u201cHe is so cute.\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.Hwang Ye-joon quickly turned his sight away from Seojun\u2019s cuteness.\u201cShall we give Seojun a Christmas present now?\u201dSeojun put down the switch at the word gift.\u2018Present! I love presents!\u2019Seojun put his arms out and started waving it.\u201cHehehe.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad he is simple.\u201dChoi Si-yoon quickly removed the switch of the little light bulb from Seojun\u2019s eyes.Brown Black found the gift for Seojun in their luggage.At that time, Seo Eun-chan, his immature uncle who was filming hard, was suddenly motivated.\u2018I can\u2019t miss out on something funny that may happen!\u2019\u201cI heard you guys rank your affection.\u201dStopped.The living room, which had been noisy because of the gifts, quickly became quiet.Slowly raising their head, the four men exchanged looks. Everyone looked so confident.\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201dBrown Black quickly cleaned up the living room. And they put Seojun in front of the sofa.Sitting side by side in front of Seojun on the floor, Brown Black hid Christmas presents that they had prepared behind their backs. Park Seojin opened his mouth.\u201cThe first person Seojun goes to is the winner. It doesn\u2019t matter how you use the present.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m first place without doing anything!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the best.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll have to test it out before you know it.\u201dWhile the four men were checking each other, Seojun sat absentmindedly.\u2018Tree\u2026 It was fun\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s so shiny! I\u2019m so happy to be with you guys. This are so new to me!\u2019\u201cSeojun!\u201dBrown Black called out Seojun, who was looking at the Christmas tree. First, they decided to show their present to Seojun in order.\u2018What? What are you guys doing there? You said you\u2019d give me a present.\u2019\u201cHere\u2019s a very cute bunny doll!\u201dThe first was Hwang Ye-joon, who won had rock-paper-scissors. Hwang Ye-joon cheered and pulled something out of his back. It was a doll.Unfortunately, Hwang Ye-joon\u2019s doll already looks exactly like his previous doll, Todol, who was abandoned by Seojun when he was five months old. Seojun pouted his lips.\u2018I\u2019m tired of it.\u2019Hwang Ye-joon was frustrated when Seojun\u2019s response was not good.\u2018How can this be? That doll shop guy said that this is the best one!\u2019It was Choi Si-yoon\u2019s turn now.\u201cSeojun, this is it! It\u2019s amazing.\u201dWhat Choi Si-yoon brought was a snowball. It snowed when he turned it upside down and let it go.Uh, that\u2019s\u2026 Seojun\u2019s head turned towards the cabinet. There were about ten snowballs. Seo Eun-chan\u2019s small voice was heard from behind Choi Si-yoon, who was surprised.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Whenever I come, I get him that as a present. The Snowball.\u201d\u201cOh ,no!\u201dNext was Park Seo-jin\u2019s turn.A bag appeared behind Park Seo-jin\u2019s back. It was a snack. A baby snack.Park Seo-jin shook the bag of snacks with confidence that he would win first place.\u201cSeojun, are you hungry? This is a delicious snack. It has banana flavor and apple flavor.\u201dHe heard the sound of the snack inside the bag, but Seojun didn\u2019t react much. He just tilted his head.\u201cWhy? Why?\u201d Choi Si-yoon, who found the cause while taking out the bag of snacks from his bag and making a mountain of cookies, looked at his cell phone.\u201cIt was a good gift that perfectly suit Seojun\u2019s taste, but the time is not good. His snack still has more minutes to go.\u201d\u201cFu\u2026Bad biological clock!\u201dIt was Kevin\u2019s turn next.Kevin swallowed his saliva when all three failed. Hmm. This is bad.\u201cI give up.\u201d\u201cGive up? Why?\u201dWhen asked by Park Seo-jin, Kevin picked up the present behind his back. Hwang Ye-joon\u2019s rabbit doll, Choi Si-yoon\u2019s snowball, and Park Seo-jin\u2019s snacks were there. Kevin shrugged his shoulders.\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me to buy one.\u201d\u201cYou shameless\u2026\u2026.\u201dHwang Ye-joon pointed a finger at him. He couldn\u2019t swear because he was filming with Seojun, but his face was quite angry. Choi Si-yoon and Park Seo-jin also looked the same.Park Seo-jin, who had been with an angered expression for a long time, came back to his senses.\u201cWell, then this will be a rank of affection in a very pure sense.\u201d\u201cYes, if you seduce him with a gift, it will be a gift\u2019s foot!\u201dBrown Black, elated again, cleared all the presents and sat side by side.\u201cCome on, again-\u201d~~Alarm~~He was about to start crying, but he heard the Alarm. Brown Black\u2019s eyes reflexively turned to the clock at the sound.2 p.m. sharp.Forty-eight hours of Brown Black with Jun is over now.\u2018Hey, guys. It\u2019s 2 p.m. Did you forget anything?\u2019\u201cOh, my!\u201d\u201cOh! Seojun\u2019s milk powder!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seojun pouted his lips at his first late meal.\u201cCome on, eat.\u201dSeojun took the nipples. While Brown Black was struggling with powdered milk, Seo Eun-chan got up and opened the door.\u201cAre you here already? You\u2019re just in time.\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon were standing outside. The couple laughed awkwardly. Seojun thought they were just in time, too.But, in reality, the couple wanted to see their son, so they were waiting in the apartment parking lot for an hour already.\u201cI\u2019m afraid everyone was suffering due to Seojun.\u201dBrown Black quickly waved their hands at those words.\u201cNo! Seojun was so nice that we had a great time.\u201d\u201cOh, welcome!\u201d\u201cHello!\u201dEveryone was talking gibberish because of embarrassment. Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon also greeted them back.Seeing that the 4 idols were still full of energy without showing signs of exhaustion, the 48 hours together with Seojun seemed to better that they thought.\u201cCome on in. There\u2019s going to be a cold wind.\u201dSeo Eun-chan pushed the couple\u2019s back and closed the door.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon saw Seojun sitting in the living room.Seojun\u2019s eyes turned to them.\u2018It\u2019s mom and dad! They said they\u2019d give me a present, but mom and dad are actually here!\u2019The dolls, snacks, and snowballs that the brothers showed were already forgotten by Seojun.\u201cAbububu!\u201dHis mom and dad were so happy to meet him again after 48 hours. With the bottle hanging in his mouth, Seojun raised his arms and insisted on hugging them both.Seo Eun-hye carried Seojun and grabbed the bottle so that Seojun could easily eat.In Seo Eun-chan\u2019s eyes, Brown Black didn\u2019t want to leave immediately, but if they stay too long, it will become a nuisance to his sister and her husband.Also he had to go to the company to edit it all the videos, and Brown Black had to practice for their debut a month later.\u201cThen let\u2019s start packing and shoot the last scene.\u201dAt Seo Eun-chan\u2019s words, Brown Black scattered everywhere to pack their belongings. As they packed their clothes, they looked at Seojun, they looked at a toy, and looked at Seojun again.Lee Min-joon opened his mouth because he felt sorry for Brown Black, who were sad that the time spent with Seojun has ended.\u201cYou can come back and visit him.\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\u201cEun-Chan, you and Brown Black are always welcome to visit Seojun.\u201dThey thought they were not seeing each other forever, didn\u2019t they? Brown Black\u2019s expression went blank.Were they really allowed to come back again?\u201cAren\u2019t we be busy after debut?\u201d\u201cI know. If you\u2019re busy, it will become harder to come over.\u201dBrown Black shook their head at the same time at the proposal of Lee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye. They all had a teary face, but they still smiled their most brightest.\u201cNo! No matter how busy I am, I will come.\u201d\u201cIf I really can\u2019t make it, I\u2019ll just call!\u201d\u201cVideo call! Video call!\u201d\u201cSend him a birthday present later!\u201dEveryone laughed at Brown Black\u2019s bright smile. Seojun also waved at Brown Black and his uncle they entered the elevator.\u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon closed the door and entered theur house. Seo Eun-chan decided to clean up the camera installed at their home later on.\u201cWhoosh.\u201dIt\u2019s quiet.The crowded house was now empty. Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon, who were not here for the last 48 hours, didn\u2019t know, but Seojun definitely felt it. It felt like the house was too big.\u201cWow, it\u2019s a Christmas tree.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re still trainees. They don\u2019t have much money. How did they get this?\u201dThey heard that they were going to decorate the Christmas tree, but Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon were surprised that tree was big and full of expensive materials. Seojun also looked at the tree within his mother\u2019s arms.The tree was decorated in very colorful manner. While looking around the tree, Lee Min-joon found a clear ball between the decorations.\u201cWhat about this?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dThere were four capsules. Lee Min-joon sat on the sofa and opened the capsule. Seo Eun-hye also sat next to her and watched.\u201cSeojun.\u201dLee Min-joon called his son\u2019s name as if he was moved. Seojun, who was sucking his bottle, turned his head to his father\u2019s call.\u201cYour brothers left you a letter.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWow, really? When did they write it down?\u201dAt Seo Eun-hye\u2019s urging, Lee Min-joon slowly read the letter.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon smiled realizing how much Brown Black had fun with Seojun.After reading all the letters, Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon decided to keep the four letters in an album. They picked out the prettiest album at home and put the letter in there.In the evening, Seo Eun-chan, who came to pick up the camera, found Brown Black\u2019s letter in an album and shouted.\u201cNooo! if they did something good thing like this, I should have gone to shoot it! Those bastards!\u201d\u201cSeojun finally said his first words! Give me the video later!\u201dSeo Eun-hye said something, but Seo Eun-chan, who didn\u2019t even listen, quickly removed all the cameras installed in their house and ran back to the dorm.Seo Eun-hye clenched her fist because of her younger brother who left without even looking back.\u2018I\u2019ll give him a punch if he come later.\u2019In the living room, Lee Min-joon, who was smiling reaching up to his ears, was holding Seojun and raising him high.\u201cDaddy, try it, Seojun! Daddy!\u201d\u201cDada?\u201dSeo Eun-hye quickly closed the door and ran over.\u201cSeojun, mom. Mom, try it.\u201d\u201cMama?\u201dLee Seojun, 8 months. He was finally able to say his first word: Dada and Mama.Seojun hugged all of Kim Hee-sang\u2019s creation of monster dolls. Finally he can have them again.Skull Lich King doll. Slime. Dragon. Orc. Twin Head Ogre. Troll. Werewolf. He hug each one.After playing with Brown Black and filming, he felt more excited and frantic. Now he felt like a real baby.In addition, he barely touched the only doppelganger bear he had left from his mom and dad.\u2018I\u2019m confused Am I a more baby now or was this really me?\u2019In a complicated mood, Seojun hugged the dragon doll. He thought he could forgive the dragon doll now.Before the library of life was created, he remembered all his previous life and almost had a state of self-destruction.He was treated as a strange monster, mixed with evil and good tendencies, and punished for heresy.Seojun made the library with all his efforts. The library was a place of seals that prevented previous life from affecting the next one.Seojun\u2019s memories of his past life turned into a book. In that case, Seojun\u2019s memory was changed to a \u201creadable book\u201d memory. Sometimes it will affects his personality.\u2018I lost in my baby\u2019s instincts to the point where I was just playing for a while.\u2019Seojun hugged the dragon doll tightly.When he fell asleep, he headed to the library of life. There, memories became clearer and reasonable.That\u2019s why Seojun, who couldn\u2019t speak a month ago, could make a sound out of his mouth imbecuae of the library.The monster dolls were a very important things that hold him from becoming more than a baby he is now.* * *Seo Eun-chan sent all the videos to Seo Eun-hye.\u201cI can\u2019t believe Seojun can finally talk! I should have seen it!\u201dSeo Eun-chan, who was crying while hitting the ground, watched the recorded video with Seo Eun-hye\u2019s permission at Brown Black\u2019s dorm. Everyone burst into tears full of emotions.He came back to edit after talking about Seojun\u2019s cuteness to his heart\u2019s content.Kim Soo-ryun, the head of the PR team and the younger brother of Kim Hwa-ryeon, decided to help with the editing.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a lot of videos.\u201d\u201cHahaha, please.\u201d\u201cWell, I can only do well if the company does well.\u201dKim Soo-ryun rolled up his sleeves. Several images appeared on the monitor screen at the same time.Seo Eun-chan took out a bunch of paper.While filming Brown Black, he made a script containing the flow for the show.\u201cLet\u2019s edit the first meeting first. Please put stickers on the baby\u2019s parents\u2019 faces.\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeo Eun-chan sat next to Kim Soo-ryeon and slowly told him what to edit. Kim Soo-ryun smiled as he edited the video.\u201cThis is fun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much I laughed while filming.\u201d-Oh, Seojun is frowning.-Is he alright? Did he get hurt?-\u2026\u2026It\u2019s okay.Anxious expression disappeared from Brown Black\u2019s face when they heard from Kim Hwa-ryeon across the camera that he was okay.Park Seo-jin said.-\u2026\u2026He pooped.-Oh\u2026\u2026.Brown Black was now facing the challenge of changing the diapers. No matter how cute a baby is\u2026When it comes to poo\u2026It becomes something unbearable.Still, Park Seo-jin, who studied hard, rolled up his sleeves.-\u2026\u2026!The rest of the members changed their faces when Park Seo-jin started changing the diaper.Park Seo-jin, who handled the diapers neatly, left a comment with a blank look on his face.-From the colors, you can see that it\u2019s a very healthy poo.\u201cLet\u2019s edit out this part.\u201d-Kim Soo-ryeon tilted his head at Seo Eun-chan\u2019s words.\u201cThis is their first time changing a diaper as an idol. Isn\u2019t this good enough? Their reaction is good, too.\u201d\u201cOh, I thought it would be a bit weird to see once Seojun grows up.\u201dAs Seojun\u2019s uncle he wants more for his own good rather than Brown Black for now.He became stricter regarding his nephew\u2019s future.\u201cThese days, kids are sensitive to even small things. Besides, these videos may last forever while Seojun will grow up.\u2026. I don\u2019t know about anything else, but poo or something.\u2026.that\u2019s a little\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026. I see.\u201d-Kim Soo-ryeon understood his uncle\u2019s heart and nodded.\u201cAnd I\u2019d like you to edit two more episodes.\u201d\u201cWhich one?\u201d\u201c[48 Hours of Brown Black with June] I want you to focus more on Jun rather than on Brown Black and edit it. Jun\u2019s fans will watch it more than Brown Black\u2019s fans. And this video will only be posted on the company\u2019s channel.\u201dSeo Eun-chan took out another piece of paper. Kim Soo-ryeon picked up the paper and read it.\u201cSong?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeo Eun-chan played one of the videos.It was a video of Brown Black singing on the first night.Kim Soo-ryun opened his eyes wide. He heard their practices before, but this was completely different.\u201cThere\u2019s a video of this and the dance and tgeir singing in the playground. I\u2019d like you to edit it separately and upload them only on our company account.\u201dIt was supposed to be on Jun\u2019s account, but they decided to post it on their company\u2019s channel.On Jun\u2019s channel will have a link to the Cocoa Entertainment channel once the videos will be posted.\u201cIf they watch 48 hours and get interested in Brown Black, they\u2019ll come on our channel. Then they will definitely see these two videos.\u201dSeo Eun-chan thought the two videos would be a path to Brown Black\u2019s success. Kim Soo-ryun, who was listening to Brown Black\u2019s song, laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s great. I understand.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, please edit two 15-minute episodes that will be uploaded for this week. Oh, and please edit the part where a civilian appears in the playground\u2019s video.\u201d\u201cOkay, I got something to do after a long time.\u201dKim Soo-ryun, who was the team leader of the PR team but had no singer to promote before but now, he could finally unleash his talents.Since the company was new and Brown Black did not debut yet, his workd was sending information about Brown Black to reporter just to be ignored without reading them.It was best to upload an introduction video on Cocoa Entertainment\u2019s homepage and YouTube channel.\u201cI look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201d\u201cLeave everything at my disposal.\u201d\u201cAh ha. I see.\u201dThe next day, Kim Soo-ryeon, who was spending comfortably at home, made a trailer for [Brown Black and Jun\u2019s 48 Hours] and sent it to Seo Eun-chan.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I forgot to ask for your opinion about this first\u201d\u201cJust add more caption.\u201d\u201cAre you really leaving it up to me?\u201d\u201cAsk your sister for help.\u201dKim Hwa-ryeon, his older sister became attached to Seojun, meddled with him the most during the shoot.Kim Soo-ryeon sat in front of the computer and quietly moved his hands because he was guilty of sending Kim Hwa-ryeon\u2019s during her vacation to film.\u201cNo, add a cuter caption!\u201d\u201cIt will look messy!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have a cuter and neater color?

Lee Min-joon, who was playing with Seojin, sat on the sofa holding him to his legs.Seojun was holding a baby bottle tightly. ~~Smack, smack.~~\u201cIt\u2019s already the last episode.\u201d\u201cI know. I can see how much fun Seojun had.\u201dIt was now early December and the video being uploaded was already the last one.They watched the video they received from Seo Eun-chan whenever they had time, but it was different to the edited one with subtitles and captions.It\u2019s already been a month, and Seojun is now nine months old.\u201cThe nine-month-old Seojun became cuter and stronger.\u201dIt felt like it was just yesterday when Seojun was looking at the Christmas tree, and uttered his first words.The camera that Seo Eun-chan left behind clearly captured him saying mom and dad for the first time.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon stored the video in their laptops, in three external hard drives, and in the cloud.The Christmas tree was being decorated by Seojun and Brown Black in the living room. Thy didn\u2019t took down the Christmas tree yet.\u201cNow, let\u2019s see.\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon watched the last episode on the television.Seojun sitiing on his father\u2019s lap, was playing with his bottle and looked at his palms. His hands got a little bigger after growing for a month.The baton symbol on his right palm became a little blurry, and the baton symbol on the left palm became a little darker.As Seojun grows, the insigna of the orchestra conductor will remain in his left palm.They became quite close to Brown Black. They would always contact them when they had time during practice during this month. Now they really seemed like a close brothers to Seojun.[Let\u2019s write a letter to Jun for the last time!]Captions were laid and the couple\u2019s eyes looked to an album in one of the cabinets. There were letters and signatures from Brown Black.They will definitely become a famous idol, so their second autograph belongs to Seojun.\u201cIf Seojun\u2019s autograph is the second one, who got the first one?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on the video.\u201dIt was the man from the playground that got the first autograph.Come to think of it, the videos in playground and the lullabies at night was not included.\u2018Well, they must have other things for that.\u2019Seojun looked at the screen.He could see the older brothers stuttering and sending video letters with their red faces.Although he already knew the contents of the letter because his dad read it, he liked it better when the older brothers told it to him in person.After the last episode, Seo Eun-hye turned off the television.She held her cell phone and looked at the number of views.\u201cThe people who watch from the first episode has watched it till the end.\u2026.\u201d\u201cNot many people were watching.\u201d\u201cI heard Chan is satisfied with this much\u2026\u2026.\u201dLee Min-joon also looked up at the cell phone screen.As they run [JUN], they were forced to compare it to the channel JUN.It was because they got used to more than 5 million subscribers.\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s Seojun\u2019s channel! There is a lot more work to do! They haven\u2019t even made their debut yet. There\u2019s still no fan caf! Also It\u2019d be great if half the view counts became fans!\u201dSeo Eun-chan, who was on the phone with Seo Eun-hye, said taking out all of his frustrations.***On the last episode, there was a small message from Brown Black.Hello, we\u2019re Brown Black.I hope you enjoyed [Brown Black and Jun\u2019s 48 Hours]Tomorrow at 6 p.m. We\u2019re going to have our debut performance on WNET\u2019s The Music Show.If you have time, please watch our debut performance.We want to become an idol who touches people\u2019s heart.We look forward to you all!This is Brown Black.***Last Thursday of December.WNET was currently in the middle of rehearsals.Producer Lee Sang-cheon of The Music Show was on stage with the monitor screen and was watching the new idol singing.\u201cThe song sounds good, but they are too nervous\u2026 Well they are first group in a new company.\u201dKim Min-hyuk, a junior, said while handing over a cup of coffee.Lee Sang-cheon shrugged and took the cup.\u201cThat\u2019s where he is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKim Min-hyuk was a junior who Lee Sang-cheon liked because he could make coffee well.Making coffee well in places where job was very competitive was a very good advantage.Kim Min-hyuk would work harder to his superiors if he knew that his coffee-making skills were what gave him his position.\u201cThe youngest son of a rich family from LA is in this group.\u201d\u201cWell, lot of sons and daughters from Rich family wants to be a celebrity, don\u2019t tgey?\u201d\u201cBut they would prefer being an actors or join a bigger agency.\u201dThe rookie idol group, which was now stage, left the stage with their shoulders down. Producer Lee Sang-cheon\u2019s eyes looked at their backs.\u201cIf you were the youngest son of King\u2019s Market, you could just play around for the rest of your life.\u201dKing\u2019s Market.It was one of the top three markets in the U.S. it is a market that operate in various parts of the U.S. with the main branch in the Korean towns of LA.It was a very large market that many people liked. It does not only sell Korean food but also Asian food ingredients were available.\u201cThere must be a lot of competition, too.\u201dProducer Lee Sang-cheon said Kim Min-hyuk.\u201cBut why did you give them a slot? Even if we were to kick out some other group, there would be month left before they got a slot. I could\u2019ve put in someone famous for a special performance.\u201dKim Min-hyuk rolled his thumb and index finger. Lee Sang-cheon snapped his finger to hit Kim Min-hyuk on the back of his head. \u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cSenior, I\u2019m just kidding! I\u2019m just kidding!\u201dKim Min-hyuk was holding the back of his head.\u201cWe\u2019re doing more music shows overseas starting next year.\u201d\u201cYes. What? Global Korean Wave? I guess you think everything would okay if you say it like that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to do it where many Koreans lives to attract a lot of audiences. Like in LA or\u2026\u2026.\u201dKim Min-hyuk exclaimed as of he understood his meaning.\u201cLA King\u2019s Market!\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to give you them performance and create a good image. If it goes well, they could become a sponsor even if they do not, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t you have to say hello? You have to shake his hand to see his face.\u201dProducer Lee Sang-cheon\u2019s eyes looked at Kim Min-hyuk.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re the only one who can express patheticness with your whole body. You\u2019ve been here for years\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dOne of the singers came to the stage and shouted at the microphone.The music stopped and the lights got dark.Kim Min-hyuk and Lee Sang-cheon looked at the monitor screen.Kim Min-hyuk sighed deeply when he saw the owner of the voice, and Lee Sang-cheon PD held his forehead.He was the leader of the West Wing, a boy band in their fifth year.Yeah, he was wondering why it was so quiet.\u201cOh, that shit again\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWatch your mouth.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dLee Sang-cheon gave directions to the microphone and the lights brightened.The rehearsal has begun again.West Wing made rough movements and went down after the rehearsal.Kim Min-hyuk, who was looking at the screen with undesirable eyes, gulped up the remaining coffee and raised his head.\u201cOh, where were we at?\u201d\u201cAbout going to say hello?\u201d\u201cYeah. Why aren\u2019t you going?\u201dA man and a woman came up on the next stage.It was a unit made by one member of a boy idol group and one member of a girl idol group under the concept of Duet.Rumors have been circulating that they were dating right after building the unit.The two people and the agency denied it, but since then, it has been the cause of the groups\u2019 fans falling apart.\u201cThe entertainment world is a place where scandals can ruin a career immediately. Even if they just touch each other\u2019s shoulders, a scandal will appear on the media, and if they we\u2019re a little cold to the reporters, they would become outcast.\u201dProducer Lee Sang-cheon crumpled the paper cup.\u201cSigh\u2026 Let\u2019s continue with the king\u2019s market topic.\u201d\u201cIf you haven\u2019t even made debut, you can go to their waiting room and say, \u2018I\u2019m the PD.\u2019 What do you think?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026.\u201dProducer Lee Sang-cheon poured the remaining coffee into his mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s not good for them and it\u2019s bad for me. They will think that The Music Show PD gave this performance with a reason.\u201d\u201cThen if you go without saying who are your is also good, right?\u201d\u201cThey must know the PD\u2019s name right now.\u201dBut Brown Black was not thinking about the producer\u2019s name.The groupd huddled together in a large waiting room together with other artist.Brown Black was in a corner while looking down at their phones.Seo Eun-chan said quietly.\u201cKids, get a hold of yourself.\u201dBut everyone was just staring at their cell phones.Kevin\u2019s cell phone had rap lyrics, Choi Si-yoon\u2019s cell phone had dance videos, and Park Seo-jin and Hwang Ye-joon were listening to the song with their earphones.\u201cEveryone made a series of mistakes on the rehearsal stage and was out of their mind.\u201d Seo Eun-chan sighed as he said those words.He has been trying to talk to them for a while, but they hasn\u2019t answered yet.Can they even hear his voice?Everyone\u2019s eyes were red.No one wanted to tear up with their Make-up on so everyone tried to hold it back.Seo Eun-chan\u2019s cell phone rang as he tried to sigh again.The saviour name Seojun texted them!***It was the day of Brown Black\u2019s debut.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon sat on the sofa. Seojun was sitting on his father\u2019s lap with the Orc doll in his arms.\u201cThey\u2019re finally making their debut.\u201d\u201cSeojun, the older members are going to be on TV soon and sing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dNow, Seojun can speak other words as well.\u201cYes, your brothers.\u201dSeojun hit the cell phone. As if saying \u2018Brother, I miss them!\u2019Recognizing his gesture, Seo Eun-hye sent a text to Seo Eun-chan.A reply came without even waiting for a second.-Seojun wants to see the kids. Can I talk to you?-Great! They\u2019re so nervous about their debut right now.A video call came from Seo Eun-chan.\u201cSeojun, your older brothers are here to talk to you.\u201d\u201cYehey!\u201d\u201cSeojun!\u201d\u201cWait! Don\u2019t push me!\u201d\u201cHwang Ye-joon! Calm down!\u201d\u201cHuh. Seojun!\u201dSeojun could see Brown Black\u2019s face taking all the screen.Their colorful makeup was on their faces, but their expression was not good. They were biting their lips as if they were very nervous and anxious.Seojun tilted his head.The Orchestra Conductor Connection was fine.It was high for the time being but\u2026Connection bond. What\u2019s wrong with it?The high number dropped by 20.\u201cSeojun, can we do this well?\u201dAmong Brown Black\u2019s loud noises, this single phrase was what captured their attention.Seo Eun-chan, who was holding his cell phone, the couple and Seojun stopped for a moment.The distracted Brown Black also became quiet.\u201cOkay. Can we do this well? Everyone else other than me will do well. But\u2026 What about me? I had no faith in myself.\u201dThis belief influenced the bond.Seojun clenched his fist at the gloomy appearance of Brown Black.\u201cFighting!\u201d\u2018What\u2019s wrong with the low connection?I can raise the \u201cconductor bond.\u201d But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll go up because I\u2019ve never used it like this, but anyway cheer up!\u2019Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon saw Seo raising his arms and said quickly.\u201cLook, Seojun says fighting!\u201d\u201cCome on, you can do it guys!\u201d\u201cYou practiced hard!\u201d\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve been practicing all day and night! We\u2019ve improved a lot while filming with Seojun!\u201dSeojun kept shouting fighting.Seojun, raise his arms up and down.Hwang Ye-joon\u2019s face, which was stiff earlier has slowly loosened.Starting with Hwang Ye-joon\u2019s smile, the members burst into laughter.That little baby, who knows nothing, cheered them up.\u201cSeojun is cheering for us!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t just say I\u2019m going to die.\u201d\u201cWatch TV!\u201d\u201cSeojun, thank you!\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes saw that the number was rising again.That\u2019s a relief.Seojun sighed and laughed.After the video call, they got a message from Seo Eun-chan.-Thank you! The kids, cheered up!\u2013I\u2019ll watch it with Seojun! Good luck!Seo Eun-hye, who put down her cell phone, watch the television where a commercial was playing.The channel was WNET.Seo Eun-hye opened her mouth and sighed.\u201c\u2026Shall we tell them we\u2019re going to America soon?\u201d\u201cWell, we\u2019re having dinner tonight, so let\u2019s talk bring this topic out.\u201dLee Min-joon patted Seojun\u2019s stomach and said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Back then, she was amazed by their first performance.Right now, things she could only see on television, were now in front of her.\u201cAre you Sarang?\u201d (Sarang is the username of Lee Mi-Yeon.)\u201cOh, hello!\u201dIt was her first time watching a music show live, so she decided to meet a co-fan who has been in touch with her through SNS these past three years.It was a woman whose username was Haneul.Haneul sat next to her smiling.\u201cWest Wing will come out at the end. \u2018Til then, listen to the other singers\u2019 songs. It will give us a good reputation, as fans, if we are respectful to other singers.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand!\u201dShe was waiting nervously, but it\u2019s now starting.[Hello! This is Music Show][I am MC Lia!][While I am MC Minwoo!]\u201cWaaaah!\u201dThe staff put up an applause sign.Lee Mi-yeon, clapped a beat late as Haneul was clapping skillfully beside her.\u201cSo pretty.\u201d\u2018I guess that\u2019s why they\u2019re an idol.\u2019The MCs are much prettier and handsome in person.Whispers were heard in front of Lee Mi-yeon as she was mesmerized by seeing idols in person for the first time.\u201cOh, I think we\u2019re the only ones here.\u201d\u201cNo choice. There aren\u2019t any famous trainee amongst Brown Black. Sigh, it is actually amazing that they even have fans before debuting.\u201d\u201cWho are they?\u201d Lee Mi-Yeon peeked and saw some people holding the same placards.[I love you, BB!][Brown Black, fighting!][Congratulations!]\u2018If it\u2019s a debut, is it today? Brown black?\u2019Lee Mi-yeon tilted her head.[My heart is already racing from the first performance][Yes, an amazing rookie groups is debuting!][Oh, have you met them, Lia?][No, but I am looking forward at their performance!]Lee Mi-yeon nodded at the MCs\u2019 introduction.She could already guess that the first stage is thet group that the people in the front row is cheering for.\u201cIt\u2019s their debut stage, so they might make a mistake.\u201d\u201cI know. West Wing\u2019s debut stage was\u2026\u2026.\u201dPerhaps Haneul was listening too, as she shook hsr head.Debut stage will remain a dark history of West Wing.However, it was the debut stage that received love and hatred by fans because that same performance became a stepping stone that made them famous.[Oh, they are under a sweet name. Cocoa Entertainment!][We hope that everyone who watches \u201cThe Music Show\u201d will support them on their debut stage!][Brown Black begins!]Lee Mi-yeon and Haneul didn\u2019t expect much. They clapped with the thought of just supporting them because it was just their debut stage.Four men stood on the stage.Brown Black, dressed in a suit, looked like a newbie to society who just got a job or well-dressed freshman at the university.As the song began, the audience fell into silence.The chatter, coughs, and rattle sounds of chairs caused by the fans talking to each other, while waiting for their idols, disappeared.The numbers that only Seojun could see were shining on Brown Black\u2019s head.The orchestra conductor connection was triggered.Lee Mi-yeon was mesmerized by the stage of the idol she saw for the first time.She looked at the stage without blinking.Her mouth was wide open.Before she could say anything, Brown Black\u2019s song reached the climax.Boom!The fireworks of the stage was fired.She got goosebumps.\u201cWow\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter finishing the performance, Brown Black bowed to the audience with having a breathing difficulty.Lee Mi-yeon clapped her hands without realizing it.Only applause and cheers rang out in the audience.Brown Black, bowed their head again while going back in the backstage.\u201cWow, this is what live is all about? I\u2019ve only watched it on TV every day and\u2026I haven\u2019t even been to the concert! Wow. If a debuting group is this amazing, the West Wing stage would be more than what they showed!\u201dLee Mi-yeon was very excited so she expected more from her idols.She didn\u2019t expect that a debuting group stage performance was this amazing.She heard that the performance of group that just debuted will be like this would be terrible and full of mistakes, but this was really unlike what the rumors she had heard of.Having a great expectations growing inside her, she was thinking about how tye performance of West Wing, a five-year-old and famous idol group, would be.Haneul, which was clapping beside Lee Mi-yeon, came also to her senses.\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dHaneul shook her head.She was thinking it better for Lee Mi-Yeon see it with her eyes than with words.Haneul saw people in the front seat.They must have been the first fans among many groups to be happy about the great stage that their debuting idol delivered.As she expected, the fans in front row are more chaotic than others.Haneul read the placards that those people were holding.[Brown Black]This was the arrival of a Monster rookie.The music show\u2019s performance continued. However, unlike the usual, the audience did not respond well.If the fans favorite singer came on, they responds, but it was weak.This was cause by the first stage. They still couldn\u2019t forget how amazing their performance was.Unknowingly, they were comparing the first stage with the performances of other singers.The music show ended with West Wing\u2019s performance.Lee Mi-yeon got up from the chair with a disappointed look on her face.\u201cI was really looking forward to it, but I don\u2019t think it was actually good. I think the song was half lip synced and there were some parts where the dance didn\u2019t match.\u201d\u201cThe first group that came out was amazing.\u201dHaneul tapped Lee Mi-yeon\u2019s drop down shoulder.Lee Mi-yeon recalled the first stage from the Music Show. It made her heart race even after when she was watching the other singers\u2019 performances.\u201cWhat was the name of the group?\u201d\u201cBrown black.\u201dHaneul, who decided to be a fan of Brown Black, laughed.* * *The music show was now over.The staff members were cleaning up the confetti that exploded at the end.Kim Min-hyuk brought a cup of coffee with a smile.Producer Lee Sang-cheon received the cup and took a sip.This guy wanted to work with him together, even for just preparing a coffee.\u201cIt was better than I thought.\u201d\u201cHmm? What?\u201d\u201cBrown Black? The group with the Rich Man\u2019s youngest son.\u201d\u201cWe are screwed.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dKim Min-hyuk, who was smiling before hearing Lee Sang-cheon\u2019s words, was surprised.He thought, the stage was good, but was actually ruined?\u201cSigh, the response for the singers after them was bad especially the last one where the confetti was popped out.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really embarrassing, but\u2026\u2026.\u201dProducer Lee Sang-cheon held his forehead. How should he sponsor them now and help them in the industry if they are good?He thought that he could help the group with a rich man son to receive a higher rewards if they promote in LA but\u2026 They actually performed better than veterans. He should have treated them better if this was the case!He pick up a confetti without even realizing it.Producer Lee Sang-cheon had a headache just thinking about the performance an hour ago.Kim Min-hyuk sat on the chair and asked.\u201cWe received a lot of ratings today. After their performance, it was so popular on social media.\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be great if it was a recorded broadcast. But it\u2019s actually a live broadcast. I heard that the first performance was so cool, so I turned on the channel, but it\u2019s the same as usual. The trend probably went off by now.\u201dKim Min Hyuk turned on his cell phone thinking so, \u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cAnd besides, they\u2019ve been talking about them for a while. We actually had them perform first, that\u2019s what screwed us. We should have changed their order to a later stage, but how come they were so nervous during rehearsals!\u201dDespite Lee Sang-cheon\u2019s lamentation, Kim Min-hyuk just stared blankly at his cell phone.The producer thought there was something wrong with him so he asked him: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re on the real-time charts.\u201dKim Min-hyuk showed his cell phone screen.1.

    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThey are on the real-time charts!\u201dAt Lee Min-joon\u2019s words, Seo Eun-hye quickly looked at her cell phone.Seojun, who was in his mother\u2019s arms, also looked at the cell phone screen.\u201cBrown Black, Review of the Music Show, the First Stage on Music Show\u2026\u201d\u201cAwesome, really!\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon looked puzzled.They were speechless until they received a video call. Their stage was amazing that both of the two of them felt goosebumps.In addition, as if they weren\u2019t the only two who felt that way, everyone on the internet wanted to know who the group was.\u201cSeojun, the older brothers are amazing! Wow! I thought they were just hard-working guys, but I didn\u2019t expect them to perform that great!\u201d\u201cI should\u2019ve seen them before my eyes! Sigh. Too bad, we couldn\u2019t see them live.\u201dWhile Lee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye complimented Brown Black,\u00a0Seojun was watching the television.He felt something burning within his heart. There was something burning within his deepest passion.The stage of Brown Black that Seojun saw was definitely great.It must have been a combination of not only [the orchestra conductor connection] but also their efforts, skills and talents.After Brown Black\u2019s performance, the applause and shouts could still be heard from the television.Seojun felt the admiration and cheered them inside himself.\u2018They are the same older brothers that used to hang out with me just a month ago.\u2019\u201cThere\u2019s a picture of the kids on social media.\u201d\u201cTheir show with Seojun was also trending!\u201dHis Mom and dad were excited without knowing Seojun\u2019s frustrated mind.While in his mother\u2019s arms, Seojun looked at the cell phone screen.The picture of the older brothers were smiling brightly on their way home.They must have cried, because their eyes were red.Someone posted a comparison of Brown Black\u2019s on their way to the Music Show and after the broadcast.They were completely different.There was also other picture comparing a picture of a famous singer that showed no interest, and a picture of Brown Black smiling broadly while surrounded by cameras.Looking blankly at the picture, Seojun suddenly realized that the life he had hoped for in his first life was happening to them.Brown Black was quite similar to him in his first life.Unlike his first life where he was unknown and died as an extra. Brown Black made their name known to the public. This was what his first life was hoping for, in order to take a step forward to becoming a star.\u2018I\u2019m gonna be star.\u2019 (TL: Insert Nayeon voice from Twice here)A resolution was thus made from Seojun.Tears fell from Seojun\u2019s eyes, while staring blankly at the cell phone screen.It was tears that even Seojun didn\u2019t realize to have shed.He didn\u2019t even know why Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon were in a hurry.Seojun\u2019s eyes did not realize how the tears fell to the screen.He helped his older brothers because he felt sorry that they were unknown.He didn\u2019t want to make them to be so desperate like he did in the past.But seeing the people who used to be right next to him twinkling over there, Seojun realized that he really wanted to be a superstar.***After all the schedules, Brown Black and Seo Eun-chan headed to Seojun\u2019s house.They were also surprised by the unexpected applause and the camera flash on their way home.When the couple opened the front door, they set off confetti to the Brown Black.No one teared up this time. Also, Seojun, who was caught between Brown Black\u2019s hugs, did not cry this time.He was a little grumpy, so he kept pushing the faces of the older brothers sticking to him.\u201cSeojun seems to be ignoring us today.\u201d\u201cI think so, too.\u201dBrown Black quickly washed up and huddled in front of Seojun.To ease Seojun\u2019s anger, Brown Black quickly picked up some dolls to play with him.\u201cOh, did Seojun have this doll?\u201d\u201d\u201cWow, this is a Skeleton.\u201dBrown Black, who saw the monster doll for the first time, was surprised for a moment, but soon they played with Seojun. Seojun\u2019s mood also eased quickly.Kim Hee-sung also arrived as he was invited for the celebration.The living room table was full of delicious food.Lee Min-joon opened his mouth after they finished congratulating them on their successful debut.\u201cWe\u2019re going to America.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWe are going to America, in a month or so.\u201d\u201cAmerica?!\u201dBrown Black shouted in surprise.Kim Hee-sung, who has been frequently meeting Brown Black in Seojun\u2019s house this past month, and Seo Eun-chan, the manager, only drank beer as if they already know about it.\u201cYes, Min-joon was appointed to the U.S. branch. We think we will be back in a couple of years.\u201d\u201cIt would be lonely for him to go alone, so we decided to go together.\u201dBrown Black nodded with a puzzled look. Then, they saw Seojun was eating the hands of King Lich.Two, three years. That was a long time.\u201cBut where are you going in America?\u201d\u201cLA. Los Angeles.\u201dIn the midst of silence, Kevin asked, and Lee Min-joon answered.\u201cWe have a house in LA. My parents and elder brother went somewhere else, now there is only my sister.\u2026.\u201dKevin showed a picture on his cell phone.It was a family picture.There was Kevin, who looked younger than now,bother two men and two women.\u201cThis is my brother and this is my sister.\u201dThey could see the face of a blunt-looking man and the face of a smiling woman.Lee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye looked at the picture.\u201cI\u2019ll call my sister and inform her about you. Call her if you have any difficulties or questions. Here\u2019s her contact.\u201d\u201cWe actually wish that we knew someone in America, but is it okay to give something like this?\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dKevin laughed at Lee Min-joon\u2019s question.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. My sister is very friendly. She will love you because she got to know more people. She is really bored most of the time, so even if you call her due to the most unimportant things, she\u2019ll come quickly.\u201d\u201cReally? Thank you. I\u2019ll be sure to contact her.\u201dSeo Eun-hye grasped the contact information tightly.They decided to go because they wanted to be together as family, but deep inside they were a little scared as they didn\u2019t know anyone.It was fortunate that they had someone to ask about life in the US.Seo Eun-hye fixed the hair of Sejun, who fell asleep.Lee Min-joon quietly looked at Seojun\u2019s face. Seojun\u2019s mouth was watering as he was dreaming about foods.\u201cI thought we could actually face this alone but I actually felt grateful that we have someone to contact in the US.\u201dLee Min-joon laughed at Seo Eun-hye\u2019s criticism. He did, too.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Because we are now parents.\u201d***(This scene happened after the filming, so it is like a flash back from the author on what had happened in the past month.)\u201cI thought about Seojun\u2019s doll, others would think it is weird for a baby playing with those right?\u201dSeo Eun-hye was heartbroken for a moment when she saw Seojun hugging each of the monster dolls that returned to him after filming.In addition, even during [48 hours] of the video, Seojun did not touch any other doll.When she asked Seo Eun-chan, he said he didn\u2019t touch it except for the first time, not only on edited version but also for the entire 48 hours.\u201cOur Seojun is so nice and smart. I think you are being too self-conscious about it right now.\u201dSeo Eun-hye, whose father died when she was young, has lived throughout her life without being frustrated, although she was sometimes hurt by the words from insensitive people.She grew up overcoming such prejudice, so she thought she was living a happy life without paying attention to other people\u2019s criticism.But this wasn\u2019t the case.If she heard someone criticizing Seojun like \u201cThat baby with that doll is weird,\u201d Seo Eun-hye didn\u2019t know what would she do in order to avoid hurting Seojun.From the doll being strange changed to the baby being strange, lingered in Seo Eun-hye\u2019s for some time.Lee Min-joon, who heard Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s worries, also became a little sensitive.This became their trauma without them knowing it.\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s us, but I thought Seojun shouldn\u2019t hear that.\u201d\u201cYeah. What if Seojun gets hurt?\u201dSo the couple played with Seojun\u2019s favorite monster dolls only in the house.Her co-mothers friends were good people, so they didn\u2019t hide it them, but they didn\u2019t take the dolls with them outside.They only packed a normal-looking teddy bear.Kim Hee-sung, who knew the couple\u2019s feelings, considered about how he should make a better doll that Seojun would also like. This came in with the teddy bear.However, such efforts made Seojun be cautious. It was like a silent pressure.From the early age, the baby already started caring about people\u2019s criticism.While Seo-joon was thinking about how to relax and play well with dolls without looking after his mom and dad, Lee Min-joon was appointed to the U.S. branch in a timely manner.United StatesA place where various people live.A place where there are people of various tendencies and even unusuality can be an advantage.Although they are adjusting their life very well as new parents in Korean, wouldn\u2019t it be better to stay in the U.S., a county in which no will care about them?Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon\u2019s trauma will also improve as they meet various people by changing their surroundings.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon, who thought so, decided to go to the U.S. with Seojun.Their money was enough.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon saw their account linked to YouTube for the first time in a while. Their hearts was beating crazily at the unbelievable amount.They donated to various organizations except for a certain amount of money to Seojun\u2019s future.\u201cWhile I\u2019m in America, we will need to study more.\u201d\u201cSeojun will now see a new world.\u201dHis Mom and dad decided to go to the U.S. for themselves and for Seojun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The park was not far from their apartment.The weather was chilly, but they are warm because they wore thick clothes.Sitting on the bench under the warm sunlight with his mom, he heard some whispers.It was from a couple sitting opposite to their bench.\u201cThat\u2019s the baby with Brown Black, right? It was on WNET.\u201d\u201cReally? I can\u2019t tell.\u201d\u201cWell, babies are very difficult to tell apart with.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t kids at that age all look the same, anyway?\u201dHe nodded his head, agreeing with her.\u201cBy the way, did you watch 48 hours?\u201d\u201cYeah, it was fun. It\u2019s going to be so hard to see a baby.\u201dSeo Eun-hye got up from her seat, carefully warmed up her stiffened body.She put down the cover of Seojun\u2019s stroller and slowly stepped off from the bench so it may not seem that they were avoiding them.When Seo Eun-hye moved away from where the couple was sitting, she went to a place where there were no people. Relaxing her legs first, she squatted on the floor.\u201cWow, there\u2019s someone out there who recognizes you.\u201dIt\u2019s already been a month since Brown Black debuted.Brown Black, left the impression of a talented idol as with their debut stage.They were still busy being called to each broadcasts and events.There was no time for them to call each other and Seo Eun-chan couldn\u2019t get home as he became busier than before.Seo Eun-hye and her mother are already accustomed to his current schedule.As Brown Black\u2019s popularity rose, more and more people watch on YouTube [48 hours of Brown Black with Seojun].When it became a hot topic on the Internet, Seo Eun-Hye sent a proposal to re-edit the show and air it on WNET.\u201cIt\u2019s a late-night show anyway, so not many people are watching. And we\u2019re going to America soon. Seojun will grow bigger in just a year so they won\u2019t recognize him even after coming back from America.\u201dSeo Eun-chan, an uncle who used his nephew for Brown Black\u2019s success, said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we posted it on YouTube or air it.\u201dWNET accepted Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon\u2019s opinions and edited the video to be released on television. This time, it was edited focusing on Brown Black rather than Seojun.\u201cI think I can put it here this time.\u201dIt was a video that they didn\u2019t upload on YouTube.Seo Eun-chan decided to include the man they met at the playground on the show.Seo Eun-chan went to Seojun\u2019s apartment to ask for consent from the man and heard what happened to his post.\u2018Why didn\u2019t I know about this?\u2019 Manager Seo Eun-chan reflected on himself.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s been promoted and it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t real publicity!\u201dWith the permission of the man, cable stations edited and they included the uploads posts posted by the man, comments on the bulletin board, and videos of the playground.-Really?-It wasn\u2019t a real promotion?-Why didn\u2019t they upload it on YouTube?-I\u2019m sure there aren\u2019t a lot of people going to see and get autographs from unknown idol groups because they love the song.-What do you mean?The man on the screen smiled brightly.-This was the first sign! It was the official first sign that was also recognized on TV.-If they became famous later, it will be very expensive.-I envy him\u2026\u2026-\u2026\u2026.-But the baby is very cute though.-Yeah, I think he is smarter than the others. I guess he\u2019s not shy at all. He don\u2019t even cry.-Isn\u2019t this him? The legendary Mukbang baby.-Oh, I think so. He\u2019s been on YouTube ads lately, with the elephant.\u201cWe have to go home quickly before Seojun is recognize by more people.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dSeojun was very excited.He wasn\u2019t as popular as the older brothers, but there are already people who recognized him.Of course they weren\u2019t sure though.His heart pounded.\u2018The feeling of getting attention from peole\u2026 i love it!\u2019***Their was currently a mess.Only the sleeping room was neat.The living room and kitchen were full of half-stacked boxes.\u201cEun-chan decided to use the house after our flight to America.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dSeojun lifted the Lich King doll.Seo Eun-hye laughed.\u201cWe can now keep Seojun\u2019s doll.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dSeojun hugged the Lich King doll and smiled brightly.Mom and dad\u2019s view of the doll was now different than before.Somehow, he felt a little comfortable with his mom and dad.Seojun was happy, too.A week later, Seojun, together with his parents, leaves to the United States.* * *\u201cSeojun, Aunt Nara is here!\u201d\u201cAuntie!\u201dSeojun, who was waving his hands to passers-by looking out the window, turned his head around.Kevin\u2019s older sister, Nara, stood at the front door as she waved her hand.Seojun ran and gave a high five to Nara.It\u2019s already been 4 years since Seojun came to America.Now, Lee Seojun is 58 months old.***\u201cAre you ready?\u201dKim Nara, a woman with short hair, smiled as she looked into Seojun\u2019s eyes through her black sunglasses.Seojun answered with his fists raised.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThen shall we go?\u201d\u201cSeojun, you need to pack your bag.\u201dSeo Eun-hye brought Seojun\u2019s bag.Seojun quickly put his arm in the strap with his mother\u2019s guidance.Soon they left home holding both his mother\u2019s hand in one and Nara\u2019s hand in the other.\u201cOh, Jun!\u201d\u201cHi, Uncle Eric!\u201dSeojun saw Eric Smith, the man living next door, who was coming out to throw away the trash.Eric asked with a smile.\u201cWhat kind of bag are you wearing today?\u201d\u201cZombie!\u201dSeojun let go of his hands from both women and twirled around.Eric gazes at the bag with zombie dolls and sewing marks design.The Zombie dolls with red blood everywhere and pale skin color were both realistic and cute.\u201cThat\u2019s great! Did your Uncle make it for you?\u201d\u201cYes, my uncle Hee-sung made it for me. Where\u2019s Jack?\u201d\u201cJack went to his grandmother\u2019s house, either way, Jack\u2019s gonna cry if he sees it later. Hee-sung is sure loaded with many doll orders.\u201d(TL: I used the name of Enhypen\u2019s Heesung here rather than Heesang. Well, in some previous translations it was written as Heesung already. But the raws used A rather than U actually.)Eric shook his head, then he stuck out his fist, and waited for Seojun to bump it with his fist.Eric greeted Seo Eun-Hye and Nara, standing behind Seojun, and went down the stairs.\u201cHee-Sung\u2019s doll is really popular.\u201d\u201cHe quit his job and started this business, it will become a big deal if it\u2019s not popular.\u201d Then Seo Eun-Hye sighed, while Nara just laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of your YouTube Videos.\u201dAfter coming to the U.S., Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon were very busy. There was too much to prepare after coming to a new place.In particular, they stayed up all night studying child laws such as child abuse.In Korea, things that would be ignored would become child abuse in the U.S.For the child\u2019s safety, they had to be careful in every action they will do to Seojun.If it wasn\u2019t for the informations prepared by Nara Kim, it would have been difficult.They did not spent a long time to get used to life in LA. It was mostly because of the accomodating people here and there.They realized that this is a place where people can comfortably live.Seo Eun-hye revealed Seojun\u2019s favorite doll by posting vlogs on their American life on YouTube.At that time, Kim Hee-sung was busy thinking about designs for dolls that could satisfy the tastes of the couple and Seojun.At first, there were a lot of comments saying it was strange for a baby to like such creepy dolls, but more and more people asked where they bought it.Seo Eun-Hye asked Kim Hee-Sung permission to post how to order on YouTube.Then, Kim Hee-Sung threw his resignation letter excitedly with both a look of joy and sorrow at the amount of orders he received.\u201cLast Halloween, most of the kids around here probably got Hee-sung\u2019s dolls.\u201dIt was Seojun who was the leader of the trend.The monster dolls that the small child carried every time he goes out with his mother and father, first caught the eye of the adults, but soon it was a trand among children.However, Jack, who lives next door and very close to Seojun, burst into tears every time Seojun has new dolls, putting the Smiths and Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon in an awkward position.\u201cAuntie! Let\u2019s go!\u201dSeojun led Nara by holding her hands.At Seojun\u2019s urging, Eun-Hye and Nara laughed and followed him.Nara and Seo Eun-Hye fastened their seat belts while Seojun sat in the baby seat.The Zombie bag was placed neatly next to Seojun.\u201cSeojun. Did you practice?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAt the question of Nara, Seojun swung his feet excitedly.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Seojun act before. Is it okay for him?\u201dHe only acted cute when filming the commercial for Elephant Milk Powder, so Seo Eun-Hye was quite troubled if he has enough skills for this type of acting required.Seojun\u2019s lips were pouting while looking away from his mother so she wouldn\u2019t see him.\u201cNo need to worry.\u201d\u201cI have right to be worried. You called me three days ago and told me to have Seojun shoot a movie\u2026 We didn\u2019t even got enough time to have Seojun practice his acting.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Movie!\u2019After coming to the U.S., Seojun, who had only filmed vlogs, was very excited.If he only dilly-dally, he would never be a superstar.Seojun ran around the living room shouting \u201cHurray!.\u201d\u201cI want to do it! Seojun wants to do it!\u201d (TL: Children at a very Young Age usually call themselves in 3rd person.)\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll send you the script!\u201d\u201cNo, wait!\u201dAt Seo Eun-hye words, Nara, who tried to hang up the phone, asked.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, a movie all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cLast time, Seojun was watching a movie documentary, so I asked him if he wanted to be an actor, and he said he Yes.\u201d\u201cAnd what did you do after?\u201d\u201cSo I sent Seojun\u2019s commercials and YouTube videos to a place where they needed children\u2019s actors, and they replied that he should come to audition.\u201d\u201cAudition?\u201dSeojun ran back to Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s at her words and asked to the cell phone.\u201cA movie shoot? An audition?\u201d\u201cHe needs to pass the audition and then shoot the movie. There will be also other child actors besides Seojun. They\u2019re going to choose the best actor in the movie.\u201d\u201cSo there is a chance that Seojun won\u2019t be in the movie?\u201d\u201cBut think of it as an experience. What about Seojun\u2019s thoughts?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201dHe was confident that he would be chosen no matter who he go against with.Seojun clenched his fists.Seo Eun-Hye, seeing her son\u2019s current image, decided to accept Nara\u2019s proposal.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll send you the script!\u201dThey got an e-mail from Nara immediately after the call.Lee Min-Joon, who returned from work, shook his head at the sight of his son staring at the script without even knowing how to read.\u201cIt\u2019s my son\u2019s first shoot, but I can\u2019t even go.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take a Video.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye held the camera as a response to Lee Min-Joon.-Oh, I forgot. It is a Marine Production House\u2019s movie.\u201c\u2026Marine?!\u201dSeo Eun-Hye\u2019s and Lee Min-Joon\u2019s hearts dropped at Nara\u2019s message.* * *\u201cBy the way, how did you know he has a show on YouTube and a commercial?\u201d\u201cI saw it from a report of Mansae. I heard Seojun has been in front of the camera since he was 7 months old, he even shot commercials.\u201dKim Mansae was Kevin Kim\u2019s real name. (TL: If you are Seventeen fans, you know what Mansae means. Basically in English, Kevin would be called Hurray for literal translations.)The eldest son Uli (\uc6b0\ub9ac), the eldest daughter Nara (\ub098\ub77c), and the youngest Mansae (\ub9cc\uc138).Long live our country, (TL: Put together their name will be Uri Nara mansae \uc6b0\ub9ac \ub098\ub77c \ub9cc\uc138 which means Hurray for our Country but the most accepted translation in English would be Long Live our Country).Seo Eun-Hye, Lee Min-Joon, and Seojun laughed for a long time when they heard their names from Nara.There was even a commotion among Brown Black\u2019s fans as they came to know Kevin\u2019s Korean Name.\u201cReport?\u201d\u201cOur grandfather told us to write a report instead of a diary or letter since we were a little.\u201d Nara shook her head.Her grandfather told her to write a report since she was a child with runny noses, and now she is in charge of writing reports about her brother who left because he didn\u2019t like working at the company and decided to be an Idol in Korea because he liked rapping.Is there any normal person in their house?\u201cMe and my brothers are more familiar with things like that than writing letters. Mansae sent a report saying that I should look forward about your family four years ago. Of course, I read it and eventually forgot about it.\u201dA few days ago, when she saw an announcement about a studio looking for a child actor with black hair, black eyes and a pretty smiling face, she immediately recalled about Seojun.\u2018Come to think of it, I think Mansae posted a report about that.\u2019When she searched the bookshelf of the study, there was a report from Mansae that she had read and put aside four years ago.\u201cThe powdered milk commercial Seojun took is just an ordinary ad for ordinary people, but it worked especially well for parents with babies. The eating shows that Seojun filmed also has a huge impact among babies under 20 months old.\u201dNara, as she read the report, also looked up to the other video.Clearly, it was just an ordinary advertisement in her eyes, but the reactions among parents and children were unusual.Nara looked at Seojun through the rearview mirror. Seojun flinched at her sharp look.\u201cIt turns out, Eric next door also watched Seojun\u2019s video. He said it helped him a lot when feeding Jack.\u201dIn addition, Seojun\u2019s video was famous among in many countries.\u201cI know that.\u201dThe first day, when they moved into this house. As they knocked on the neighbor to say hello, the Smiths, who came out, exclaimed imediately \u201cOh, Jun!\u201d with a surprised face when they saw Seojun in Seo Eun-hye\u2019s arms.The couple and Seojun were also surprised.Since then, the two families have become close friends.\u201cAlso, Hee-Sung\u2019s doll that Seojun always carries is selling well. He promoted it and now it\u2019s sold out. That means Seojun has some charisma that captures people.\u201dNara was later considering using Seojun as a model for King\u2019s Market. But everyone was against it because he was not famous at the moment.Seojun tilted his head.Seojun had never used his ability. Hee-sung\u2019s uncle doll was really just popular.Nara\u2019s car stopped as they arrived at their destination.Nara unfastened her seat belt and said while looking at Seo Eun-hye and Seojunn in the back seat. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. Just take it as a practice. As I said on the phone, it\u2019s an extra role that would appear for a short time. He just have to look at the camera without shaking. Did you read the script?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMarine\u2026\u2026. Seo Eun-hye recalled the name she tried to forget.Oh\u2026\u2026. Unlike her mother, who was pressured, Seojun was really excited. He can\u2019t believe he was going to film in a huge company from the start!\u201cMy mom read it for me! I practiced, too!\u201d\u201cYes, good job!\u201dNara dropped Seojun off the car.She didn\u2019t forget to put the zombie bag on Seojun\u2019s back.\u201cThis way.\u201dNara walked in front of the two.There was a loud noise coming from where Nara was facing.It was full of people moving boxes and people running around.Nara spoke to a security personnel. The guard said something on the radio.Soon a man came running from afar.\u201cHello! I\u2019m a staff here, Jonathan Will. Are you here for the audition today?\u201dJonathan Will, a middle school student with freckles, asked with a piece of paper in his hand.The paper was full of red lines.\u201cYes. He is Seojun Lee.\u201d\u201cYes, wait a minute. There is another child actor who is auditioning right now.\u201dJonathan wiped the sweat and guided the three inside. .\u201cThis way.\u201dJonathan opened the entrance of the tent.It was then.\u201cWilliam!\u201dThere were screams of women.\u201cOh, my god!\u201dThey heard a child crying.Jonathan closed his eyes tightly.The three people, unaware of the circumstances, tilted their heads.When the child\u2019s cry didn\u2019t stop, a very loud voice was heard.\u201cJonathan Will!\u201d\u201cYes! Director! I\u2019ll be right there!\u201dJonathan, with a haggard look on his face, quickly said.\u201cIf you wait here, the makeup artist will bring your costume. You can change into that outfit and come out when they call you. I might not be able to come and entertain you anymore.\u201d\u201cJonathan Will!\u201d\u201cYes, yes! Coming!\u201dJonathan, who turned pale at the voice of the director, quickly ran toward the set where he could still hear the child crying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The scenario must be scary for the child.\u201d Seo Eun-hye answered as Nara entered the tent.\u201cWill Seojun be okay?\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019m totally fine. I\u2019m rather excited about the upcoming shoot.\u201dSeojun replied and sat in a small chair that the staff has prepared for the child actors.Whether it was a waiting room for child actors auditioning or not, there were two cribs, a large table, a small table, a mirror, an adult chair, and several child chairs inside the tent.There were also snacks, sandwiches, and juice.Seo Eun-hye also looked around the tent.So this was an American set. Even If she had never been to a Korean movie set, she could tell that this was amazing.Nara handed a cup of coffee to Seo Eun-hye and asked.\u201cDo you feel pressured about the movie, Marine?\u201d\u201cI felt like dying these past three days.\u201dSeo Eun-hye answered with a sigh.Her hands were shaking as she signed the audition and shooting agreement sent by mail.\u2018Marine!\u2019The name of the most famous film company in the world now is the top three.They are famous by making real-life pictures of Marine\u2019s cartoons and superheroes.Their most popular movie was Redborn.Redborn, which no one was interested in, turned the world upside down after its release.Redborn fans have sprang up all over the world.Now, they were filming Redborn 2, and many people were paying a lot of attention to it.\u201cAuntie Nara. When will Redborn coming out?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s another Marine movie, not a Redborn movie.\u201d\u201cAyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!\u201dSeoju, who enjoyed watching Redborn, pouted his lips.Indeed, even though it was a Redborn movie, the scene Seojun will only be going to film was a very short scene that the audience will forget in just a second.Nara laughed quietly looking at Seo Eun-hye, who was drinking coffee to calm herself down.\u201cThis is a secret but the filming of Redborn 2 was delayed due to an accident, Marine decided to produce and release two another movies beforehand. That\u2019s why their shooting schedule is tight.\u201d\u201cTwo?\u201dJust as Nara was about to answer Seojun\u2019s question, a cough was heard outside the tent.\u201cExcuse me, may we come in?\u201d\u201cYes, come on in.\u201dTwo men and a woman came into the tent.The woman was smiling, while the man was wearing a thick robe.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Melissa, playing William\u2019s mother.\u201d\u201cHello, I\u2019m Barren, and I will be helping you with the shoot.\u201dSeojun came down from the chair and greeted them back.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Seojun Lee, a child actor.\u201dThe two were surprised but then smiled.They had heard that the last child actor is the youngest of 4 years old and 10 months old. He is quite smart and spoke very well.\u201cI thought it would be better to get closer to your before the shoot, so I came here.\u201dThis was already the fifth time that they came to the waiting room for a child actor to say this. Melissa was very awkward and her lips were twitching.\u201cIt would be scary if I suddenly lifted him from behind without knowing me first.\u201d Of course the same was true of Barren.\u201cOh, sit down. I\u2019m Seojun\u2019s mother, Eun-Hye Seo\u201d\u201cNice to meet you. I am Nara Kim.\u201dAfter saying hello, the atmosphere in the waiting room became quiet, but the awkward atmosphere soon was resolved.It was because of the sociable Nara, actively asked about the filming.\u201cIt must be hard for you to repeat acting the same scene.\u201dMelissa shook her head.\u201cI can act as much as I want, but the problem is because the kids cry so much.\u201d\u201cA woman that they have never seen before screams loudly in front of them while a strange man catches him from behind, scares most of the kids.\u201d Barron smiled bitterly.\u201cThey must be too scared because they\u2019re too young.\u201d\u201cWe just have to act, but the staff is already having a hard time.\u201dMelissa and Barron recalled Jonathan Will, the only crew with a nice attitude to take care of small children.Jonathan Will has been running around all day long today, to soothe a crying child.Melissa and Barren decided to achieve their purpose of finishing filming the scene by entering the tent.Melissa, Barren, Seojun. The three actors sat in chairs and talked.They continued talking from playing with his friend next door, Jack, to the story of another movie they were filming now.Seo Eun-hye smiled, feeling proud of Seojun, who was talking happily.Melissa asked.\u201cJun, have you read the script?\u201d\u201cMy mom read it for me.\u201d\u201cHow was it? What do you think William would feel?\u201d\u201cHe must have been very happy.\u201dMelissa and Barren, who had already shoot for several times already, were showing a questioning face.Happiness?That can\u2019t be true.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cMy mom called my name.\u201dSeojun recalled the script that his mother read to him.The scene where Seojun comes out will be short.Enemies who invaded the Earth created wormholes all over the Earth.The scene in which Seojun appeared was one of the scenes that showed such damage.The baby, who was playing alone in the garden, watches the emergency news and looks at his mother running out of the house.\u201cWilliam!\u201dWhen the mother calls his name screaming, he smiles brightly holding the teddy bear that the baby was playing with.At that time, behind the baby\u2019s back created a frighteningly black wormhole.The desperate mother called him out more than ever.\u201cWilliam!!\u201dBut the baby just laughed even more brightly at his mother\u2019s scream.And in an instant, the baby disappeard into the wormhole, with Just one shoe left.\u201cWilliam doesn\u2019t know anything. I was just happy that my mom called me.\u201d\u201cGood interpretation.\u201dThey heard an unfamiliar voice. No, it\u2019s similar to what they heard earlier.When Seojun raised his head, a man came into the tent.Seojun, who was sitting on the chair, looked at the man with his head lifted to the point where it hurtHe was huge.He was so tall and big.Seo Eun-hye and Nara\u2019s eyes were shocked. Wouldn\u2019t he be an athlete if he hadn\u2019t been a movie director?\u201cDirector!\u201dMelissa and Barren, who were sitting next to Seojun, suddenly said.It was Ryan Will, the director of the film.Ryan Will came inside the tent.Next to the director stood a makeup artist with a cosmetics box and a stylist with clothes for Seojun to wear.Ryan Will sat in front of Seo-joon.Seojun and Ryan Will\u2019s eyes met.Ryan\u2019s blue eyes moved up and down as he looked at Seojun.The child was bigger than in the video.Black hair. Black eyes.He has clear features, so the director thought he will come out well on the screen. His height seemed also reasonable.He didn\u2019t look scared even when he faced him, a big man.In addition, Seojun have interpreted the script in his own way even though he was only an extra.It was different from other child actors who will just moved as their guardian said.Ryan Will smiled and held out one hand to touch Seojun\u2019s face.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be afraid of me, so you have courage. Nice to meet you. I am Ryan Will.\u201d\u201cHello, I\u2019m Seojun Lee, a child actor. Please call me Jun.\u201dRyan Will\u2019s big hand shake Seojun\u2019s small hand.\u201cYeah, no matter how sad and serious the situation is around, William doesn\u2019t know anything. So you have to smile happily. Jun.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun smiled broadly at Ryan\u2019s words.\u2018I\u2019ve got my secret weapon!\u2019Ryan Will, also greeted Seo Eun-hye and Nara Kim. After that he went out from the tent to prepare for the next shooting.\u201cThen shall we change your clothes first?\u201dSaid the stylist as she looked at the clock. Seojun changed his clothes.Fortunately, Seojun was already dressed quite warmly because the season in the movie was autumn.\u201cIt\u2019s a little chilly, but the cloth is thick and there\u2019s a heating pad inside so he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to put on much makeup either.\u201dAfter finishing their work, the two quickly went out of the tent looking for another job.\u201cThen we\u2019ll be there, too. Jun. Fighting!\u201dThe so-called Wormhole role Barren, who will help lift Seojun from behind the back, and Melissa, who play William\u2019s mother, went out of the tent to prepare for the filming.They also went out of the tent to talk on the phone for a while.Everyone left, and only Seo Eun-hye and Seojun remained inside the tent.\u201cWhat is Seojun doing?\u201d\u201cMeditate!\u201dSeojun took out a flat slime pillow from a zombie bag.It was his favorite item.Seojun always carried with him the pillow made by Kim Hee-sung.\u201cSo you want to sleep?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s called meditation.\u201dSeo Eun-hye laughed.Where did he hear the word meditation?She was also surprised by his development of the language that was far superior to his son\u2019s peers.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be here reading a book.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun went up to a corner of the tent. Then he lay down on the slime pillow.His mother covered him with a blanket on one side.\u201cThen I\u2019ll wake you up when it\u2019s time to shoot.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s meditation.\u201dSeojun said while his mouth was pouting, and closed his eyes.The \u201cSummer Bear\u2019s Hibernation\u201d engraved on the back of Seojun\u2019s head showed its outstanding effects.He fell asleep as soon as the back of his head touched the pillow.[Summer Bear\u2019s Hibernation \u2013 The Lowest]Summer bears are active only in hot summer. While autumn, winter, and spring is too cold for them so that they only sleep during that season.Seojun fall asleep as soon as he lay down and close his anywhere for 30 minutes a day.It increases his resilience after sleeping a little bit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He searched for this inside the yellow door library three days ago.As the beads sparkled, a smile pattern appeared on both cheeks of Seojun.[Illusion of the Mushroom smiley face- Lower class]When he smile, fantasy magic unfolds to the person who sees your face.The target creates a certain amount of sympathy for the user.The effects and duration vary depending on the target.\u201cThere is a big problem, it will automatically be used when I laugh.\u201dRubbing his cheeks that seemed to become a little warmer, Seojun recalled what had happened a week ago.It was an ability that he searched all night long after listening to the script that his mom read.He was happy to find the right ability, so he quickly used it.The next morning, he smiled at his mom and dad as usual.[The illusion of the mushroom smiley face is triggered]Pardon?Suddenly, his mom and dad hugged Seojun. They couldn\u2019t control the overwhelming feelings burning within their heart, in a tearful voice the both of them said.\u201cOur Seojun!\u201d\u201cOur cute Seojun!\u201dThe effect varies depending on the subject. It seemed to have caused more intense emotions because he was their child.Fortunately, their feelings soon subsided. However, Seojun had to be hugged by his mom and dad for half a day due to the influence of his skills.All the effects disappeared that evening.He was surprised to know that this skill was better than he thought of. Soon he went to sleep quickly.He can\u2019t use this on daily basis, so he took the skill back to the Yellow Door.But today, he needed the skill back so he got no choice but to sleep on set in order to enter the Yellow Door.He opened his eyes.Seo Eun-hye, who was reading a book, looked at her watch as Seojun stood up. Ten minutes hasn\u2019t passed yet.\u201cYou really didn\u2019t sleep?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s meditation!\u201dWhenever he saw his mom, he felt like he was going to smile.Seojun put all his strength to prevent himself from smiling.He shouldn\u2019t smile right now, of else he would be in a big trouble.\u201cSeojun Lee. We\u2019re about to shoot.\u201dJonathan, who was listening to the children\u2019s cries all day long, called them outside the tent with a very pale face.\u201cYes, we are coming. Let\u2019s go, Seojun.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeojun, who was forcing himself not to smile, walked out of the tent holding his mother\u2019s hand.* * *(TL: Another chapter from he was a monster.)\u201cI feel sorry for the mushrooms!\u201dA large mercenary was crying loudly with his face smashed into the table.His other big colleagues, sitting at the same table, shook their heads and drank.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201dA Mercenary from another party, who passed by, asked.The mercenary leader said, \u201cTsk! This time we went to the mountain to ask for a request, and there was a crying mushroom. He was ahead in the front of us. As soon as he entered the realm of the weeping mushrooms, he burst into tears as if he was beaten to death.\u2026.\u201d\u201cLooking at his situation, I can\u2019t even ask what had happened.\u201dThe mercenary nodded his head.\u201cIf it\u2019s a weeping mushroom\u2026 Then he\u2019d be fine by tomorrow evening if he cry like that.\u201d\u201cIf he I caught up to him, I would have also cried half a day.\u201d\u2026.\u201dThe mercenary leader shook his head as he saw the mercenary eating the food without even lifting his head on one side of the table. The mercenary raised his head as if he knew the leader was telling his story.\u201cCaptain! I heard the weeping mushrooms are really good! I should have collected it yesterday!\u201d\u201cIf you put your feet in the area, let alone collect them, there\u2019s no way you can return back without crying. Still, if they are sold they would be very expensive.\u201d\u201cHey!\u201dOne person interrupted the mercenaries\u2019 conversation.He was wearing a brown cloth and carrying a large sack. He look like a herbal mercenary.Next to the herbal mercenary was a child, who appeared to be his disciple.\u201cWhere\u2019s the mountain with mushrooms?\u201dThe mercenary leader, who glanced at the herbal mercenary, raised his index finger and the herbal mercenary threw a gold coin.Herbal mercenaries and his disciples slowly climbed up the mountain, which was taught by the mercenaries leader. Holes were dug here and there and trees rose high.It was such a rough mountain that large rocks and tree roots were tangled up.\u201cTeacher, you can\u2019t just give gold like that! How would you know it\u2019s the real crying mushroom?!\u201d\u201cIt is not crying mushroom\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, herbal mercenaries must use the exact official name! Okay. Smiley face mushroom!\u201d\u201cThe Mercenary was definitely under the Illusion spell. There\u2019s only one way to get illusiin magic from this part where no wizard can see it.\u201d\u201cI do know that. A silver coin would have been enough though!\u201dWhen the herbal mercenary, who was walking earlier stopped, his student also shut up.Three rocks were visible, as the mercenary commander said.\u201cIt\u2019s around here.\u201d\u201cLook it up.\u201dThe two found a smiling face mushroom circling very large near the rock.As he was full of experience with plants, he could see small white spots and know exactly what it was.It was a Smiley face mushroom.\u201cFound it.\u201d\u201c\u2018We should be ready!\u201dThe disciple lowered his back pack and took out a crossbow.Meanwhile, the herbal mercenary slowly looked at the area of the smiley face mushroom and found a tree.When the disciple handed over the crossbow, the herbal mercenary shot the crossbow.\u201cHit!\u201dThe student ran away from the mushroom and quickly tied a rope to a tree.The herbal mercenary also tied ropes to nearby trees.Then he tied another rope to his body, tied high like a clothesline.\u201cBe careful, Master.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThe Illusion of the Mushroom Smiley Face\u201d was a magic that one get when they see a mushroom\u2019s smiling face inside the mushroom\u2019s territory.Smiley face mushrooms could be collected without seeing the faces of mushrooms, but unfortunately, all four sides of the mushrooms were faces.Wherever they went, they had no choice but to see mushrooms.This herbal mercenary learned one way from his predecessor.The herbal mercenary took out a thick cloth and covered his eyes. Then slowly, relying on the rope tied to the tree, he moved toward the smiling face mushroom.A month later, a big and small mushrooms where prepared on the Emperor\u2019s table.Two smiling face mushroom dishes were served. (TL: Poor Seojun, he died as a food in this story.)\u201cI didn\u2019t know there were Smiley mushrooms! You got also two of them! This will pay off all your debts!\u201dThe disciple smiled brightly when he saw what was inside the pocket was full of gold coins that he received from the Emperor.At the pupil\u2019s smile, the herbal mercenary crumpled the debt paper into his pocket.* * *Jonathan Will guided Seojun and Seo Eun-hye to the filming location.Jonathan took out a small teddy bear from his bag and handed it to Seojun.It\u2019s already been the fifth time he have handed it over.He really hope that the shooting will be over now.To be honest, he didn\u2019t have much expectation for this kid either. It was because even older children would cry when they started filming.\u201cThis is for filming, so keep it.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWith a teddy bear in one hand, the three headed to a place where the staff gathered in a circle.The staff\u2019s expressions were also not good at the shooting that lasted all day.It was already their fourth time that they shoot this scene.Seojun and Seo Eun-hye saw staff around the ordinary American homes and Camera installed on one side of the yard.\u201cThe guardian can wait here. The actor needs to go to the director.\u201dAt Jonathan\u2019s words, Seo Eun-hye waved slightly to Seojun.\u201cDo a good job.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dJonathan held Seojun\u2019s hand and headed to Ryan Will, who was looking closely at the monitor.\u201cDirector, actor Seojun Lee has arrived.\u201d Ryan, who was comparing the screen with the videos they shot, turned his head at Jonathan\u2019s call.\u201cYou\u2019re here. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dRyan Will got up from the chair and headed to the yard with Seojun.Later with the editing using CG, the place where Seojun is currently standing now would be a wormhole.Seojun, who was looking around the floor marked with tape, looked up and looked at the door where Melissa ran out.He could see it very well.[Illusion of the mushroom smiley face is triggered]On Melissa\u2019s door, cameras were installed, connected to where Ryan and some staff are located.The background of Seojun were currently colored blue.When he turned his head, the blue area returned to its original state.\u2018There\u2019s only one face, and there\u2019s only this much territory.\u2019Seojun nodded.The camera will film Seojun\u2019s face anyway, so it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cHere you play with the teddy bear Jonathan gave you and raise your head when Melissa calls you.\u201d\u201cI know!\u201dRyan laughed as Seo-joon answered confidently.Unlike the other child actors, who were overwhelmed with embarrassment whenever he explained, he was a bright kid.That did not stop to give him an advice.\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised later because Barron will carry you up.\u201d\u201cHi, Jun.\u201dBarron, dressed in green, waved between a hole in the floor where he was hiding.Even his fingers were covered with green cloth.Seojun waved his hand.Can they look forward to seeing Seo-joon relaxed this time?Ryan got up after taking off the tape that was attached to the floor.\u201cYou can make any mistakes, don\u2019t worry. Tell me if you feel cold.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201dRyan, who lost his mind, returned to his seat.There was a chilly wind.Ryan Will, who sat in front of the monitor, raised his hand and the staff became quiet.Seo Eun-hye, held her breath unconsciously looking at the set. She didn\u2019t sat on the prepared chair for her and just looked at Seojun.Somehow, she was worried about her son not smiling since they got out from the tent.\u2018Is it because he\u2019s nervous?\u2019Seo Eun-hye thought it was normal because it was his first time filming a movie.Seo Eun-hye, really looked more nervous than Seojun. Nara noticed her and patted her back.\u201cHe\u2019ll do well\u201d she whispered quietly.While looking at the mushroom area, Seojun turned his head and saw his mother and aunt Nara standing side by side.He wanted to smile at his mom\u2019s nervous appearance to reassure her but, um, no.It was better if he did not do it before the shooting.Seojun raised his hands and touched the side of his mouth.When the camera director looked at Ryan, Ryan nodded.Ryan shouted loudly.\u201cReady!\u201dMelissa, who was holding the doorknob tightly inside the house, breathed in.She was preparing herself to scream the only line she has said throughout the whole day.Her line is only \u2018William!\u2019But she had to express the nervousness and distress contained in it.Barren on the hole also breathed heavily. Timing.What he needed to do is to lift Seojun up in the right timing.Seojun held the teddy bear tightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They are too busy with the main characters busy, so it is useless.]Swarin An, who was smiling lightly, hardened his face.As a middle-aged man with a deep impression hardened his face, the atmosphere became serious in an instant.[But good actor has to understand the history of even an extras.]\u201cHow?\u201dSeojun, who dropped a crayon from his hand, was stopped by his father trying to sit in front of the television.He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Swarin An\u2019s serious face even within his father\u2019s arms.[Make it.][There are many clues. It\u2019s all in the script. You have to analyze, understand, and make a story even in the slightest clue.]So Seojun made it. He made a history of the Extra he was playing.The clue is teddy bear, the mother and his smile.Director Ryan Will\u2019s voice was heard from the distance.\u201cReady, action!\u201d***William is now four years old.He received a teddy bear, that was in his hand, for his 4th birthday.From every gift he received, he liked this teddy bear the most because his dad gave it to him.Talking to the teddy bear while in the garden was William\u2019s favorite game.There wasn\u2019t much story Seojun could make of.He thought that today\u2019s breakfast was delicious. Cookies are the best snack. Shall he play with teddy again today? Should he play with that?William may have thought that today was an ordinary day. The weather was chilly, so his mom dressed his thick.William sat in the yard where he played with the teddy bear.\u201cWilliam!\u201dHis mom called him.William looked up to where was his mother\u2019s voice coming.The mother was looking at the baby in the opened door.William loved his mother.He really loved when his mother\u2019s calls his name.\u201cWilliam!\u201dHis mom came running.At the sight of his mother running with her arms outstretched, William also held out his hands with a teddy bear in his arms.William smiled happier than ever because when his mother hugged him, she gave him delicious cookies.But\u2026It was dark before he could knew it.His whole body was cold.\u201cCut! Okay!\u201dRyan\u2019s shout stuck in Seojun\u2019s ear.Seojun opened his eyes wide.\u201cHuh?\u201dWhat? When did the shooting started?With a blank face, Barren\u2019s worried face came into his view.\u201cAre you surprised? Did I pull you too fast?\u201dBarron hugged Seojun and rolled around.When Seojun stretched out his arms toward Melissa, seemed to be a good timing, so he quickly grabbed Seojun\u2019s side and pulled him down.Then he looked at Seojun\u2019s condition right away.In previous shoots, other child actors began to cry at Melissa\u2019s voice when she screamed.Even though they barely passed the scene, they would cry and freaked out when Barren tried to grab the child actor\u2019s side.But Seojun didn\u2019t cry and has his eyes closed tightly.His lips were also a little blue.Was he cold?But Seojun\u2019s body in Barren\u2019s arms was warm enough.Worried about his comolexion, Barren asked again.\u201cAre you okay, Jun?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Barren?\u201d\u201cNo, Jun\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay!\u201dDirector Ryan\u2019s voice brought Seojun to his senses and shouted.Barren, who was patting Seojun on the back, dropped Seojun on the ground.Two people he came with, ran towards him\u201cAren\u2019t you scared?\u201d\u201cNo, it was fun!\u201dIn fact, he couldn\u2019t think of anything else. Seojun just thought about William. Happiness, his Mom, and being pulled in the wormhole.Cold, dark.Seojun tilted his head.What is it?Ryan and the camera director were talking while looking at the monitor with a serious look on their faces.On one side Melissa was wiping tears with a handkerchief.Barren was surprised to see Melissa like that.He knew she was working hard, but he didn\u2019t know that she would be so immersed to the points that she was crying.Besides, it was the 5th same performance today.He didn\u2019t expect her to have such kind of power remaining.\u201cYou were so immersed in it?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201dMelissa, who was trying to answer Barren\u2019s question, saw Seojun holding Barren\u2019s hand and began to shed tears again.Barren and Seojun were flustered and didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d\u201cMelissa, why are you crying?\u201d\u201cOh, my. I feel so bad for William.\u2026.\u201dEventually, the other staff took Melissa to the waiting area.The faces of the staff taking Melissa were bright. It was because the OK sign finally fell out of Ryan Will\u2019s mouth.Everyone look at Seojun once and give him a proud look.Barren shook his head as he looked at Melissa\u2019s back going to the waiting room accompanied by the staff.\u201cI don\u2019t think there are only good things about immersed acting.\u201d\u201cImmersed Acting?\u201d\u201cWant to know, Jun?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHow should Barren tell this to a 4-and-10-months-year-old baby?Barron thought about it for a while, but decided to trust the smart Seojun.He explained it slowly with easy to understand words.\u201cImmersed acting is to become the character itself instead being just an actor.Melissa, for example, is usually Melissa, but during this filming, she forgets herself and becomes William\u2019s mother.\u201d\u201cWilliam\u2019s mom\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeojun thought hard.Wouldn\u2019t his current situation be the same thing?Seojun forgot that he was Seojun and became William.He knew that he was being dragged into a wormhole, but he also knew it was Barren, not a real wormhole, yet he still felt his body getting cold and dark.Is this what immersed acting is like?\u201cImmersed acting is good, but it\u2019s not easy to get out of character like what happened to Melissa after filming.\u201d\u201cGet out of character?\u201d\u201cMelissa needs to forget being William\u2019s mother and becomes Melissa again.\u201dIt was different again.As soon as he heard Ryan\u2019s \u201ccut,\u201d he was not William anymore.Seojun tilted his head.\u201cHow do you do the immersed acting?\u201dWhen asked by Seojun, Barren awkwardly coughed and said in a serious voice that was so unlike him.\u201cThe basis of all acting is understanding. Character\u2019s role\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI understand what\u2019s going on!\u201d\u201cUnderstanding the History\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cSwarlin An!\u201dBarren\u2019s neck and face turned red at Seojun\u2019s words.\u201c\u2026Did you also watch it Jun?\u201d\u201c\u2026You saw it.\u201d\u201cI am a fan of Swarlin An.\u201d Laughing shyly, Barren said.\u201cHe is also my favorite actor.\u201d Seojun laughed too\u2026\u2026.Clap!Seojun slapped both of his hands. (TL: The type of slap that look like a clap because he is doing it to himself. Truthfully I don\u2019t know if it was arm or hands that he was hitting.)\u2018I didn\u2019t laugh yet!\u2019Clap! Clap!\u2018I didn\u2019t laugh!\u2019Fortunately, his ability was not activated.Barren didn\u2019t know what to do when Seojun suddenly clapped hard and made voice as if he was hurt.\u201cAre you all right, Jun?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally!\u201dHis palms were hurting and his face was having muscle cramp, but it was fine. Really.\u2018I\u2019m going to sleep as soon as the shoot is over.\u2019* * *\u201cReady!\u201dRyan shouted loudly.A tightly closed door appeared above the monitor screen.On the other screen showed Seojun sitting on the floor.\u201cAction!\u201dThe door opened and Melissa appeared.The camera shot Melissa\u2019s face.Ryan looked at her face.She seemed desperate and was a bit of a poor performance in his eyes.She was a mother who ran out because of the emergency news.Among them, Melissa\u2019s face had to be filled with the belief that her son would never disappear, and anxiety, but Melissa\u2019s face had only the urgency of looking for her son.Maybe it\u2019s because they filmed too much. Ryan was about to shout NG but because he knew that the staff and actors had suffered all day, he decided to watch Seojun\u2019s performance.He thought if this kid was terrible, he\u2019d just delete this scene.\u201cWilliam!\u201dMelissa\u2019s scream was heard and Seojun rose from the screen.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201dWilliam got up.The little baby stood up and welcomed Melissa with a big smile.[The illusion of the mushroom smiley fave is triggered]Not only people but also Seojun, who was into acting, could not hear any sound.When Seojun\u2019s smiling face was zoomed in, director Ryan Will, who was monitoring, and camera director James Landon, who was filming the scene, swallowed their breath.Melissa, also had her jaw-dropped. Jonathan, who was among the tall staff, opened his mouth wide.It was the smile of a child smiling brightly, he may looked happy but his heart was choking and shaking.It\u2019s been as if they were stuffed up.It was unbearable to know that the child would soon disappear inside the wormhole.\u201cWilliam!\u201dMelissa, who saw the wormhole, shouted, no\u2026 she was now William\u2019s mother.\u201cOh, my child! My precious child!\u201dMom shouted.\u201cNo!\u201d She felt as if she had eaten a ball of fire.There was no sound as if his throat was clogged.William disappeared into the wormhole with a smile on his face till the end.Now, he only have one shoe left.The mother, who had become emotional, collapsed in the yard.Mom couldn\u2019t take her eyes off from the place where the wormhole disappeared. Tears fell from her eyes.It was Ryan Will who came to his senses first within this suffocating situation. He shouted loudly, forcing his throat to utter sounds.\u201cCut! Okay!\u201dEveryone who were immersed in their acting was having a hard time breathing, but everyone returned to their senses at the Director\u2019s cut.The waiting staff approached Melissa.Meanwhile, director Ryan Will and the camera director, James, secretly wiped away the tears that were falling from their eyes, and Jonathan went to the corner weeping.While the staff were organizing the scene, the two directors went to watch the scene once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No, it was the best every scene.He showed a startling performance.Ryan smirked.The little boy\u2019s acting made him cry, which would have been unthinkable if it were Ryan Will from an hour ago.\u201cAt first, I thought his legs hurt when he sat on the floor.\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe way he stood up smiling seemed more welcoming to her.\u201d\u201c\u2026is it a coincidence?\u201d\u201cHe could be a genius.\u201dIt was Seojun\u2019s smile that made their heart ache even when they looked at it again.Just thinking about the amount of people who will watch this scene would react made him laugh.James nodded.\u201cA five-year-old actor who can make his co-actor immerse in their role. Someone will think it\u2019s a joke.\u201d\u201cHe is not even five years old.\u201dRyan laughed.\u201cWhat? How old is he?\u201d James asked.\u201cHe is 58 months. It\u2019s been 10 months since he became four.\u201d\u201cWell, he will be five in two months.\u201d* * *\u201cOkay at once?\u201d\u201cJun did a good job. I got emotional, too.\u201d\u201cMelissa\u2019s acting was amazing, too. Even her last expression!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen Melissa\u2019s movie before, and it\u2019s totally different from then. It was a similar role, but today, I feel like she broke out from her shell.\u201d\u201cBut, did you see that?\u201dOne of the staff\u2019s voices whispered.The staff, who were moving the luggage, stood up.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cRyan and James, the camera director were crying.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is Melissa acting that good?\u201d\u201cNo, I felt like they were crying at Jun\u2019s acting.\u201dThe staff tilted their heads.\u201cIt maybe good but not enough to cry?\u201d\u201cI think Jonathan was crying, too.\u201dThe staff made eye contact with each other. Jonathan Will is Ryan Will\u2019s nephew and was now studying under his uncle to become a film director.He was a boy expected to win a prize at a film festival for middle school students.\u201c\u2026Is there something we don\u2019t know?\u201dThe temporary tent used as a child actor\u2019s waiting room was weak in soundproofing. Seojun, who was drinking orange juice, nodded at the conversation of the staff coming from outside.He recalled the number of people watching him at the time of filming.About 30 people.Melissa, Ryan, James and Jonathan Will. These four people.\u2018[The illusion of mushroom smiley fave] is low-level, so it only works for people like this.\u2019The top-notch skill that worked for everyone who he targeted, [the coveted packaging of a small mimic], was a skill beyond comparison with [the Illusion of the mushroom smiley face].***Today, Lee Min-Joon arrived at home first. At dinner time, the family talked about what happened on the set of the movie, while eating a large curry with potatoes and meat made by his.Lee Min-joon asked continuously because he was sad that he couldn\u2019t see his son\u2019s first time in filming a movie.\u201cHow was the shoot?\u201d\u201cIt was fun!\u201d\u201cAfter hearing compliments from the director, Seojun must did a great job, right?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dBefore they went home Director Ryan stopped by the tent after the shooting and patted Seojun\u2019s head lightly, saying, \u201cWell done.\u201dSeojun just laughed.\u201cI even took pictures and videos. Let\u2019s see watch them later while eating strawberries.\u201dAfter dinner, the three of them ate dessert while watching photos and videos taken by Seo Eun-hye on television.The first picture that appeared was Seojun and Ryan Will shaking hands.Seojun looked very small in the picture taken with a large Ryan.Seojun said while eating strawberries.\u201cIt\u2019s the director!\u201d\u201cHe is huge.\u201d\u201cNara says he\u2019s over 190cm tall.\u201cWow\u2026\u2026. I think he would have done a great job if he were an athlete.\u201dThen there was photo of Seojun with Melissa, and Barren with their already changed clothes afterwards.\u201cYou can\u2019t leak this. But because it is Seojun\u2019s first time filming it, he allowed me to take pictures from afar.\u201dNext was Seojun\u2019s scene.Unlike the video that director Ryan Will showed to Ssojun, while saying \u201cIf you are an actor, you must monitor your acting after filming,\u201d the mother\u2019s video from a distance looked different.It was amazing to seeing himself from the distance.Sitting on the floor, standing up, stretching out both arms.It felt like someone else was moving in his body.Lee Min-joon clapped his hands as he saw Melissa\u2019s faint and Seo-joon disappeared leaving only a shoe.In particular, Melissa\u2019s performance made Lee Min-joon feel extremely sad.\u201cThe actress Melissa\u2019s acting is amazing.\u201d\u201cI think so too. I can\u2019t believe she was unknown so far.\u201d\u201cWhat about me?\u201dSeojun asked his parents because they were only complimenting Melissa.Seeing their son being sulky they smiled broadly.\u201cSeojun did a good job, too!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe he got an OK in one try! Well done!\u201dSeojun smiled and took a bite of the red ripe strawberry.\u201cBut when is it going to be released?\u201d\u201cThey need to shoot more and do some background work like CG\u2026\u2026.and Nara says it will be released in late March or early April.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to watch it at the cinema.\u201d\u201cBut since it was an audition and filming, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll write a scene where Seojoon comes out or not.\u201d Seo Eun-hye hesitated a little and frankly said to Lee Min-joon, who was currently checking the schedule with anticipation that his son would be in a movie for the first time.Seojun, who was eating strawberries unintentionally, was the most shocked.\u2018No, I worked so hard filming it, and it was hard not to laugh all day long!\u2019\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYeah. Why? I heard he got an OK?\u201dSeojun and Lee Min Joon asked Seo Eun-hye.\u201cI heard that in movies they don\u2019t use everything they shoot. There are a lot of scenes that are going to be edited out. Cut out the useless parts, taking in consideration the movie\u2019s time.That\u2019s probably why [movie deletion scene] and [movie director] appear on the Internet every time.Nara said in advance that they shouldn\u2019t disappointed after watching the movie, in case Seojun didn\u2019t appear on the movie.Seo Eun-hye\u2019s words has Seojun laying on the carpet.\u201cI tried my best!\u201dLike a zombie doll, Seojun rolled around on the carpet.\u201cI did my best!\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon laughed quietly at Seojun\u2019s antics.* * *Two men in suits were walking somewhere. The two men had open Ipad in their hands. I am not really a fan of Marvel so I don\u2019t know which movie represents the others.\u201cShadowman\u2026\u2026.\u201dMarine, is a production house that produces many movies.The Vice President Richard Bowin, scrolled through the Ipad.Among Marine\u2019s numerous directors, Palin is in charge of RedBorn.\u201cNo choice. If we change Redborn main actor to another, it\u2019s going to be a mess.\u201d\u201cYeah.That\u2019s true.\u201dRedborn was a superhero film produced by Marine Production House at a huge cost. Of course, the resulting revenue was also enormous.In order to keep up with the popularity gained from the first film, the main actors of Redborn were casted.They spent more money on production for this movie than the first one for more manpower and latest equipments.In addition, they were planning a massive promotion with simultaneous overseas releases.Based on that preparation, Redborn 2 was now in the middle of its filming.\u2026.\u201cHe was ruined by paparazzi.\u201dRichard Bowin frowned.The main character of Redborn was chased by paparazzi and had an accident. Fortunately, it was not life-threatening, but it will take time for him to get well and start acting again.A big hole has been created within the schedule planned for Redborn 2.At this rate, there was no use for the equipment and manpower acquired, they are going to lose more money at this point.Richard Bowin and Palin were forced to put two directors\u2019 films in between the schedule.Money, no, it was okay that they lose money. They had decided to test the next generation directors of Marine Production House. They had been paying attention to them for these past two years.Marine Production House has made calls to two promising Directors.One is Ryan Will.He was a short film director who dealt sharply with social issues such as racism. He had good directing skills, but he especially had a good eye in searching for actors. He casted them himself for his movies so the vividness of the movie gave deepl impression to the audience.\u201cI was wondering what would happen if he could use his casting skills for other Marine\u2019s film.\u201d\u201cThe actors in Shadowman are almost unknown. From the portfolio alone it isn\u2019t interesting. Would it suit?\u201dOn the Ipad screen in Palin\u2019s hand, Ryan Will\u2019s resume, the cast\u2019s resumes and portfolio appeard.They are actor good at acting but not very attractive.There is even an extra that came out for a short time of period.He wanted to asked Director Ryan Will what sort of talent he found in these actors. The other party\u2019s expression isn\u2019t good either.Whether he listened to him or not, Richard Bowin just tapped his finger on Ryan Will\u2019s resume, which rose above his pineapple screen.Richard Bowin said in an irritated voice.\u201cI don\u2019t even like choosing Shadowman in the first place.\u201d\u201cWell, Shadowman is not popular.\u201dPalin nodded his head.Redborn was the most popular character within Marine Comic.That\u2019s why it was made into a movie and was able to become a hit all over the world.On the other hand, Shadowman, frankly, wouldn\u2019t have been known if they hadn\u2019t heard it from Ryan Will.Palin, who was looking through the portfolio, shook his head.He couldn\u2019t tell no matter how hard he look at it.What kind of movie will it become between director Ryan Will and these actors?\u201cWhat about Sarah?\u201dRichard shook his head and looked at the newly-emerged resume.Palin opened the \u2018Sarah\u2019 folder in the Ipad.Another director. Sarah.She was the director who won the grand prize at the short film festival with a beautiful background and action scene that blends with music.In particular, sha has a reputation with her action scene going well with the music reminds peipley of a music game.She was a must-have director for superhero movies featuring cheerful action scenes. She also directed her first full-length commercial film.\u201cThe actors of Sarah\u2019s cast are quite well-known. I got good reviews for their acting skills. I wonder what Sarah\u2019s Green Wing would be like.\u201dGreen wing.It was a character that was quite popular among Marine\u2019s heroes with its incredibly fast speed.Marine Production House also recommended it, and Sarah herself said yes at once.They were looking forward how she would film the world of speed.Two men arrived in front of the big door. Palin grabbed the doorknob.They could hear the loud door slowly opening and rumbling.Large screens were installed in the center among the seated people.It was a pre-edited preview of films conducted inside Marine Production House.Richard and Palin sat in their own seats. Soon, the host came up to explain about the two films and the two directors.The inside of the conference room became dark.Soon, Marine\u2019s logo appeared on the screen, and two superheroes looking at each other appeared on the screen.[Green Wing vs Shadowman]\u201cI don\u2019t know about anything else, but the promotional phrase has been decided.\u201dIn this kind of confrontation, the public definitely couldn\u2019t have been less interested.\u201cNow, let\u2019s watch Ryan Will\u2019s Shadowman.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Justice to deal with the evil of the world.There was no one who invested to him, so he made a short film at first.His first short film showed social problems such as racism and the gap between rich and poor.After that, the opportunity came.He was offered by Marine Production House.[Shadowman]It was Ryan Will\u2019s first hero movie.The main character, Mac, was an alien child who landed on Earth.The alien, who landed with him, quickly died and as a baby, who couldn\u2019t even walk at that time, faced the society while growing up in an orphanage.Only a cold society was for orphans, but thanks to acquaintances who loved him, he started to like this country and this world.One day, a necklace came into Mac\u2019s hand.Aliens invaded Earth in search of the necklace.Mac, wearing the same necklace around his neck, used his powers to protect the Earth.But people went missing while Mac was fighting the aliens.And one of the missing people was the biggest villain of Shadowman.\u2018That\u2019s William.\u2019Ryan Will wanted to turn Shadowman into a series but it wasn\u2019t his thing.So he thought about whether to include this scene as a double track or not, and he finally decided to add it in the end.Ryan\u2019s superhero and Shadowman\u2019s only opponent is William.Ryan recalled the image of a boy.The black-haired boy stood looking at the dark masked shadowman with a cold look on his face.Before filming the movie, originally William was a white man with black hair, but after seeing Jun, he decided to add his childhood story and not edited out the scene anymore.\u2018This movie needs to be successful so that we can film the next one.\u2019However, no matter how irrational Ryan was, he had to be optimistic about the film\u2019s success.\u201cSob, sob\u2026\u201dIt was Richard Bowin, the vice president, crying like a child who lost his mother.***In April, when the flowers bloomed, the theater was full of people.Today, Shadowman and Green Wing were simultaneously released.\u201cMom!

Come on!\u201dIn front of the entrance, Seojun was stamping his feet with his slime bag.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon were walking behind Seojun while holding packed snacks and clothes for him.\u201cSeojun, it\u2019s still cold because of the spring breeze. You should put this on.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeojun put on his outerwear.The couple eventually burst out laughing at the sight of him being too excited.\u201cAren\u2019t you too anxious?\u201d\u201cYeah! I\u2019m in a movie!\u201dOn March 10, when he was still in the U.S., Seojun\u2019s birthday party was held.(TL: So Seojun\u2019s Birthday is March 10)The two-year business trip to the U.S. has been extended to four years due to the circumstances of his father\u2019s company.They were worried about the extension, but fortunately, their business trip to the U.S. is finally now over.Since they had to leave the U.S. soon and return to Korea, they invited people who where their close friends to say goodbye and threw a party for Seojun.While eating, playing, and talking, Seo Eun-hye\u2019s cell phone received a call. It was director Ryan Will.Ryan confirmed Seojun\u2019s appearance and congratulated him.Seojun ran around the room shouting \u201cHurray.\u201dHe was then scolded by his mother, but he couldn\u2019t stop laughing at Seo Eun-hye\u2019s face and the other people\u2019s faces.Everyone congratulated and promised to watch the movie where Seojun appeared.And time flew by. Now, they are back in Korea to organize their luggage, cleaning up their house and find a kindergarten for Seojun to attend.And today.Finally, Shadowman was released.Since this morning, Seojun\u2019s eyes have been sparkling.The couple intentionally decided to go after the release date because they were afraid that Seojun would have a hard time due to many people watching.But they still booked movie tickets on the first day as Seojun couldn\u2019t stay still from the day he watched the trailers.Even inside the elevator, Seo Eun-hye shook her head as she looked at Seojun, who couldn\u2019t stay still for even a second.Lee Min-Joon and his wife were shocked by the \u2018Shadoman\u2019s ad\u2019 they saw for the first time in Korea.It was because Marine\u2019s two hero movies, Shadowman and Green Wing, were advertised as rival movies.Furthermore, the movie tickets would be use as a mode of voting to encouraged more competition.Also, the internet heated up even before the movie was released as it said that people could win figurines of the hero and certain other products by the end of the lottery.Since then, Seojun has been very nervous. He was confident of winning the audition, but, now, it\u2019s a movie versus a movie.He was worrying about how Ryan edited it.What if they edited out the part where he use [Illusion of the Mashroom Smiley Face]?Seojun recalled director Ryan Will\u2019s face, he was calm even after the shooting.He patted his head and said he did well, but does that really mean he did well?Seojun was now very nervous.The elevator arrived on the first floor and the family headed to the nearest movie theater.This was the largest movie theater in this neighborhood.The movie theater was crowded with people. People here and people there.Seojun held his mom and dad\u2019s hands tightly.He had never seen so many people before.\u201cDo you want to watch the Green Wing?\u201dDespite the noisy place, these words struck in Seojun\u2019s ear like an arrow.Seojun pouted his lips.Since then, there have only been people talking about Green Wing.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon also turned their heads and heard the conversation between the two Marine Fans.\u201cThat\u2019s a scary promotion.\u201d\u201cI know. I heard people went crazy when they heard Redborn main character had a car accident.\u201dSince leaving their houses, all the streets have been promoting Marine\u2019s movie.Lee Mi-yeon took the reserved ticket out from the machine.Green Wing\u2019s tickets were sold out, so they bought Shadowman.They were going to watch both movies anyway, so it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cBut still, Marine is Marine. How can we make a topic of conversation with this kind of confrontation?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ll watch both. Two new directors, a famous character and an unknown character.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure Green Wing will win, right?\u201d\u201cNow that I remember, the director of Green wing won a lot of awards.\u201dMarine was promoting the Shadowman on the right side of the Green Wing in one pamphlet, perhaps because the promotion of the two films, Marine has decided for rivalry.Green wings in green and shadowman in black.Below that, they wrote down the film director\u2019s history.Certainly, Green Wing\u2019s Awards were more.\u201cIt\u2019s weird. Usually, people put an unknown director in a famous character and a famous director in an Unknown in order to be fair, right?\u201d\u201cI see. This is a complete lose for Shadowman.\u201dDefinitely, Lee Mi-yeon already know about Green Wing, but Shadowman was only found out when the movie trailer came out.Park Sung-ah, who had been thinking for a while, said.\u201cOr maybe he was after people\u2019s psychology.\u201d\u201cPeople\u2019s psychology?\u201dSeojun, who picked up a Pamphlet also raised his ears.\u201cBecause if you think the movie is going to lose in a one sided battle, people are bound to cheer for the weak. The Underdog.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s a possibility.\u201d\u201cWell, they know what are they doing. It\u2019s Marine.\u201d\u201cBut when will Redborn 2 come out?\u201d\u201cI think it will be summer because it is summer vacation.\u201dThe two people, who were chatting, turned away.Those who listened to their chatter also turned around and pretended that they did not hear them.It wasn\u2019t just Park Sung-ah and Lee Mi-yeon. The movie theater was full of chatter about Marine, as if they had only come to watch Marine\u2019s movie.Two movies made by the same movie company.Everyone gathered at the cinema to exercise their right to vote, as if they were cold-hearted movie critics.\u201cAs expected, there are a lot of people watching Green Wing.\u201d\u201cGreen wing is very popular.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to watch Shadowman! Support the Underdog!\u201d\u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201dThe couple laughed at Seojun\u2019s words. Seojun held the movie ticket that his mother gave him.Shadowman Hall 3.\u201cMom, it\u2019s the third hall!\u201dSeojun is now good at reading numbers.The family held on their pounding hearts as they stepped inside the third hall.\u201cWow, the green wing movie is no joke.\u201d\u201cYeah, our world now feels so slow. I thought the time stopped.\u201dThe screening of Green Wing ended first.The audience expressed their thoughts as a person came out one by one.\u201cThe background music and the timing was amazing. When the Green Wing hit the villain, the rings was at the right timing. It\u2019s like hitting with music. It\u2019s not even 4D, but I thought it was 4D!\u201dSome were planning to watch it again and some shook their heads, saying it was worse than expected.However, people couldn\u2019t help but nod their heads, saying, \u201cAs expected of a Marine movie.\u201dThe previous airing of the Shadowman ended also as many people who lined up and went in slowly.The door of the third hall opened.People came out, but it wasn\u2019t that many.A movie theater employee, who saw that the previous audience of Shadowman are coming out, shouted loudly.\u201cShadowman\u2019s screening is over. Please bring your things and come out. Tissue is prepared in front.\u201dIt was so loud that even the Green Wing audience, who was going down from the side, could hear it.As the movie theater staff said, there were several tissue boxes next to him.The Green Wing audience was confused.It was a film by Marine competing with Green Wing, even though it is underrated.It must have been a cheerful superhero movie, but why the tissue?When the movie theater staff finished talking, a person appeared in front.He was the only who came alone and lined up for the tissue. He was so busy crying that he didn\u2019t even know that the door had opened.\u201cOh, my. I\u2026\u2026 Phew\u2026\u2026 sob sob\u2026\u2026please\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, here it is.\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026\u2026 sob sob\u2026\u201dAfter that, the remaining audience came out. Some of the audience who watched Shadowman were crying.There was only about 10 percent of the audience, but most of them were crying so hard that it stood out even more.One was crying but still getting tissue, and the other needed to come out with a friend\u2019s help.The friend was very embarrassed.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d\u201cWill\u2026\u2026 I feel so sorry for William\u2026\u201d\u201cI also feel sorry for him, but\u2026\u2026. Was it to the point where you need to cry?\u201dLee Mi-yeon burst into tears.\u201cHey, I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201dPark Sung-ah quickly pulled the tissue from the tissue box next to the movie theater staff and gave it to Lee Mi-yeon.Lee Mi-yeon kept crying while wiping her tears with the tissue.Even after Lee Mi-yeon\u2019s appearance, there were visitors who cried from time to time coming out from Hall 3, which screened Shadowman.They were crying regardless of gender or age.Green Wing audiences were staring at the shadowman audiences.What kind of movie is it?The audience who already watched the Green Wing was curious.Some were already booking tickets for the next Shadowman movie on their phones.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seojun\u2019s name is coming up.\u201d\u201cHuh? My name?\u201dSeo Eun-hye quickly changed the subject because her son cried so much.Just in time, the names of the production company, actors, and staff were coming up on the black screen with Shadowman\u2019s OST.Meanwhile, the name SEOJUN LEE was seen in quite large letters.Tears blocked the view, but Seojun saw his name for sure.[SEOJUN LEE]The white alphabet seemed to sparkle. Seojun couldn\u2019t take his eyes off at his slowly rising name even though he was shedding tears.In the meantime, the Internet went wild with the reviews of Shadowman.As expected, Green Wing was very popular, and many of the reviews were posted in the early stages.Soon there was a review of Shadowman. There were many reviews saying that both movies were interesting.There were already people looking forward to their second movie.Then a person posted an interesting post.<<Title: Shadowman is weird.Why am I crying?The green wings screening was sold out, so I watched Shadowman instead but I cried. I don\u2019t really cry when watching dramas. I don\u2019t cry even when I was sick enough to get surgery. But when I look at the baby\u2019s face, I suddenly cried over the movie. Was this really a Marine movie? Did I just watch a wrong one?Why?>>It wasn\u2019t just him.As the days went by, reviews and photos of others began to appear in the internet.It became an issue when more reviews about how they cried over Shadowman continued to appear from time to time.One of the most talked about was a reaction video of a YouTuber.The YouTuber\u2019s content is about movie reviews, when the two movies of Marine were released he immediately posted a review of Green Wing but in less than a week he uploaded a review of Shadowman seeing that it was the main topic of the Movie fans.[Shadowman\u2019s Tears Challenge 15th]\u201cHello, I\u2019m Review The Movie. I am happy to say that I\u2019ve finally made it!\u201dThe YouTuber said, while wiping his tears with a tissue.\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve calculated that 0 to 10 percent of people have cried. There were times when no one cried at all, and times when 10 percent of the audience cried.\u201dThen he showed his own ticket on the screen.It was a spreadsheet that recorded the number of viewers and the number of people who cried during the 15th time he watched it.The largest percent was 10.\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was going to watch it for 15 times. I think I know what other people are saying. What should I say, I realized William\u2019s real acting? I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off from the child\u2019s face since the moment where William laughed. Melissa\u2019s performance as a mother was great, but now I can\u2019t help but feel that the child actor who played William is really talented.\u201dThe YouTuber opened a browser window on the screen.\u201cSo I was wondering who the child actor that played William was, so I searched him in internet, and guess what I found?\u201dWilliam as [SEOJUN LEE]\u201cHe is a Korean child actor! I thought about what should I do in order to find out if he is a Korean-American or pure Korean but out of the blue\u2026My sister, a fan of Brown Black since their 1st year said something behind me, looking at a picture of a child actor playing William.\u201d\u201cShe said \u2018Oh? He look like Seojun.\u2019 Seojun. Seojun Lee. Isn\u2019t it the same? When I said it to my sister, she said, \u2018No wonder!'\u201dThen the YouTuber open another two windows on the screen.It was a photo of Seojun holding a powdered milk with the brand censored and Seojun with Brown Black.\u201cA Korean! A star who appeared in commercials and YouTube Entertainment shows! It\u2019s Lee Seojun!\u201dThe YouTube video soon became a hot topic within hours.[Did you cry or not when you watch Shadowman? Is it a hoax or not?]Because many people were curious, journalists aiming for a click on the topic quickly released their articles.[Lee Seojun, the youngest Korean Hollywood actor!][No.1 this year, too! Brown Black and Hollywood actor Lee Seojun already met in the past?!][Marine\u2019s chosen child actor!][What do people who shed tears have in common? How delicate you are!][Did you cry, too? Shadowman\u2019s Secret!]Many people wondered why they shed tears.One movie critic said in an interview, \u201cMaybe because William was smiling without knowing anything about his surroundings.\u201dMany people were convinced by the movie critic\u2019s interview, but still many shook their heads.Just for that reason, they should have only cried at their first time watching it.This issue was not only in Korea.In every country where Shadowman was released, the Shadowman\u2019s Tears Challenge has spread fast like a fire.In particular, Koreans, who swore to conquer the challenge, bought many Shadowman tickets consecutively.***Director Choi Dae-man has now a chance to film his first film.A film production company, saw director Choi Dae-man\u2019s videos and proposed to work together.Dream Production Company has made many movies with a broad range of genres, he was excited for his Movie but got discourage when he came to know the genre.Because the genre of the movie he was going to direct was a mystery movie, a rare genre in Korea.Choi Dae-man wanted to make a perfect movie, so he traveled around the country in search of inspiration and actor that could suit the movie.A month and a half later.It was like he wandered around the country without any results.Looking at resumes and portfolios from other companies, he found actors he could scout for the movie but they were either busy or not interested with the plot. So he went back to Seoul and organized auditions.The production company started to become impatient and required him to complete the work by August.They thought that the director was only wandering around the country.Because of that\u2026\u201cHere it is. Here it is!\u201dHe found a village.Choi Dae-man, who found the perfect location for the movie, faced other difficulties again.The casting manager, who was scratching his head with the tip of a pen, sighed quietly and opened his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s already the third audition. There was child actor but failed the screening and the other child actor, who got the highest score in the first audition was eliminated personally by you, Director.\u201d\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to be sorry. I think you are strict because it is your first film.\u201dThe casting manager, who looked unhappy, sighed with his arms crossed.The conference room became quiet for a moment.\u201cThere is a child actor who is drawing lots of attention these days. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll come all the way to Korea to film this movie, but\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe casting manager suddenly remembered something so he blurted his thoughts.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you ask the child actor to participate in the audition?\u201d Choi Dae-Man asked.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe casting manager recalled the movie he watched a month ago.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be in our movie because he\u2019s so famous.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Besides, he is good at acting, so he is also a hot topic in Korea and the United States. Most Hollywood films with child actors would have already sent their script to the child actor.\u201d\u201cMarine? Uh, Hollywood?\u201d\u201cYes, the 100 billion-dollar Marine Production house and the 100 million-plus-budget Hollywood film that they usually call a low-budget film.\u201dChoi Dae-man had a question. How good was the child actor for the casting manager to say that?The casting manager, who was smoothing his chin, opened his mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at him now. Director.\u201d\u201cDo you know who he is?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you see him.\u201dAt the urging of the casting manager, Director Choi left the conference room and headed towards the nearest movie theater.Director Choi Dae-man stepped into the movie theater.It\u2019s been a month since it was released. Green Wing\u2019s audience were getting smaller, but Shadowman still had a lot of people.They bought tickets for the Shadowman movie and looked around.Everyone was either holding a box tissue in one hand or a handkerchief.Tissue?Handkerchief?Also, there were many people holding cameras.\u201cHello, viewers. It\u2019s already my 10th challenge as of today. I heard that a person in the next room succeeded in his 15th try one! I\u2019ll try to break that record!\u201d\u201cChallenge no.5! Here we go!\u201dOther visitors didn\u2019t even seem to care about those people.They were even talking about whether they would a succeed or a fail.\u201cWhat the hell is happening\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat the hell happened while he was wandering the countryside.\u201cThe Shadowman movie, Hall 4, will begin shortly! If you bought a ticket, please fall in line before entering.\u201d It was the voice of the movie theater staff who helped Choi Dae-man clear his head from confusion.Facing the crowd, only his most complicated expression appeared.\u201cYes My dear viewers. We\u2019re about to begin. Sorry for this late live. I\u2019ve been in China for a month, but when it was released in China, I couldn\u2019t understand anything so I decided to not watch it until I return to korea. So guys, this would be my first time watching Shadowman.\u201dSome even did live broadcasts, but no one seemed to care.Why so?Choi Dae-man held back his sigh and sat down in the chair.While watching the movie, he was worried that the lights on the camera would disturb him, but contrary to Choi Dae-man\u2019s worries, when the lights inside the movie went out, everyone turned off all the lights from their camera as if they had promised to do so. Those who were chatting earlier also shut up.The sudden silence gave him goosebumps.\u2018Come to think of it\u2026\u2026.\u2019They were all holding cameras, smartphones, and tissues, but the most important thing to carry when watching a movie wasn\u2019t present.Popcorn and soda were essentials as the modern Koreans says in the internet, \u201cI went to watch movies in order to eat popcorn,\u201d but there was no popcorn in their hands.Also no Drinks, nachos, and grilled squid butter that smelled strong.\u2018What the hell happened in a month?!\u2019He got goosebumps from his back.No matter what great movie it is, there is not a single one who held food among the audience!Choi Dae-man wanted to yell at the sight, but Marine\u2019s signature came out from the dark screen.Mac is an orphan, but he met good people and lives happily.One day, he finds a bloodstained necklace in a corner while delivering pizza using his ability to move through the shadows, a skill that he kept secret about even from his precious acquaintances.As soon as Mac\u2019s hand touched the necklace, a signal-light rose into the sky.Narta, the planet that received the signal of from the traitor, launches a battleship in order to eliminate the traitor.And to stop Narta, Mac uses his ability to control the shadows.Like a counterattack against Mac, Narta created wormhole around the world. The other side of the wormhole was also unknown by Narta.People all over the world have been sucked into the wormhole.Television around the world sent emergency news to evacuate.However, it could not alert the people about where would the next wormholes would occur as it would happen in an instant, absorbing anything to its way and disappearing immediately without any trace left.Mac, the Shadowman, defeated the Narta warship but could not stop people from becoming victims.Shadowman lowered his head at the sight of the woman crying, wearing his mask and unable to make a sound.Flashing!The light inside the movie theater turned on. The breathtaking silence was lifted for a moment.The movie theater became noisy.\u201cOh, it\u2019s a failure again. But in a little while, I\u2019ll try for the eleventh try!\u201d\u201cHahahaha! I cried! I cried, everyone! William\u2026\u2026.Hahaha!\u201d\u201cShadowman\u2019s screening is over. Anyone who needs tissue is ready in front of you!\u201dIt was a ridiculous situation, but Choi Dae-man could not focus his attention towards them. This was because tears were dripping from his eyes.William, who was smiling, disappeared into the wormhole.He got goosebumps.It was just a smiling face, but he didn\u2019t expect it to hurt like this.He really got goosebumps this time.This level of acting reminded him of what the casting manager said.\u2018I\u2019m sure many directors from Hollywood wants to hire him as an actor.\u2019While crying, Choi Dae-man nodded his head. If this is the case, he must cast him to his film, even if he begged with his knees while holding his feet.Choi Dae-man, who came out from the movie theater, searched who was the Shadowman cast that portrayed William on his cell phone. Everyone must have searched it, because it was on the automatic search keyword.[Shadowman William][Shadowman William Child actor][Shadowman William Lee Seojun]He read a familiar name.Lee Seojun.For a moment, he remembered the cute baby from 4 years ago like a thunderbolt.\u201cLee Seojun? Lee Seojun!?\u201dChoi Dae-man\u2019s finger pressed the search button.He was now reading his information window.The most famous person of the same name that he knows appeared in the same information window with the same child smiling brightly.He\u2019s definitely bigger than the last that when he saw him, but his clear features was still his bright eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s really Seojun!\u201dIt was Lee Seojun, the same baby he shot in the advertisement for Elephant powdered milk.He got goosebumps.He thought he was a genius, but he never thought he would become a big time actor the next time that he saw him.He didn\u2019t expect him to become famous to the point he had gone in the U.S. and appear in a Marine\u2019s movie.\u201cHe is a genius.\u201dChoi Dae-man went into a nearby cafe and ordered an iced Americano and sat down.He started surfing the Internet about Shadowman and Lee Seojun.During the month that he was traveling around the country, many articles about [Brown Black and Jun\u2019s 48 Hours] and [Shadowman] as well as the Elephant Milk powder commercial, were made.WNET was re-runing the show with a more catchy title \u201cHollywood child actor Lee Seojun\u2019s 48 Hours!\u201d.There were also a lot of articles that could click bait readers such as \u201cThe Youngest Korean Hollywood Child Actor!\u201d and \u201cThe Korean child actor chosen by Marine Corporation.\u201dIf a person becomes famous, malicious comments arises as some trolls were saying, \u201cEven so, it\u2019s only an extra,\u201d but there were also many comments saying it was still an amazing feet.Choi Dae-man, who was eagerly reading down the screen, received a call.\u201cOh, it\u2019s been a while. Team leader Kang Sora.\u201dThe recipient was Kang So-ra, the team leader of Elephant Milk powder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They even came and explained it to them what had happened.\u201cSo there would be no milk powder commercial, now?\u201d\u201cNo, but we will come up with a trick. Right now, we don\u2019t plan on advertising at all.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dMilk powder advertising has been banned. International regulations have been set to ban powdered milk advertising and more than 120 countries, that have joined the WHO together with Korea, followed the law.It was to prevent abuse of powdered milk. That\u2019s why the milk powder commercial that Seojun filmed wasn\u2019t serving anymore.That was not the only reason.As technology advanced, the quality of TV was greatly different.The advertising effect was good, but it was not suitable for future customers other than the parents with babies.It was great enough to release a commercial that was shot four years ago throughout the entire year.Kang Sora opened her mouth to break the bitter atmosphere.\u201cOh, I watched Seojun\u2019s movie. He did a great job.\u201d\u201cBecause Seojun likes to act. I\u2019m thinking about sending him to an acting academy these days.\u201dTeam leader Kang Sora rolled her eyes.\u201cAn acting academy? So Seojun, who filmed a movie of \u201cMarine,\u201d will go to an acting academy\u2026\u2026.?\u201dA mess would probably happen.His picture would probably be posted on the wall of the acting academy, and the head of the academy would appear on television and promote his academy under Seojun\u2019s name.Many other things would happen, but it would hardly be a good thing.When team leader Kang So-ra blurted out her words, Seo Eun-hye, who knew what she was worried about, also smiled bitterly.\u201cSo I\u2019m thinking about it. Acting isn\u2019t something he can do alone. Seojun and I don\u2019t know anything about acting, so I am worried that it may affect his acting career.\u201dSeo Eun-hye continued as she watched Seojun, who was eating orange juice while watching a movie documentary on her cell phone.\u201cI wish I had a friend who knows about acting or a teacher who knows acting very well.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cIn addition, Seojun is getting many scripts proposal, and I don\u2019t know which one is good.\u201dAs the relationship between Seojun and Brown Black became known, proposals were pouring in toward Seo Eun-chan, the manager of Brown Black.It was amazing that so many companies in the world wanted him in their advertisement.In addition, many child role proposal were also coming from dramas and movies.It was hard to tell which one was good or bad, so they were all rejecting it.But, it was mostly Seojun who rejected it.It was then.\u201cSigh.\u201dKang So-ra got up from her seat with her bag in her hands.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201dKang So-ra, who received a phone call, went to the corner of the cafe. Not long after, she returned to her seat with a subtle look.\u201cSeojun\u2019s mother.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you remember the director who shot the commercial last time?\u201d\u201cYes, I remember.\u201dSeo Eun-hye and Seojun nodded.It was his first ever commercial shoot.Every moment of it was memorable.He remembered the kind director who said he was a genius and gave Seojun his phone number to give him even a little help.\u201cDirector Choi wants to see you one day. What should we do?\u201d\u201cWhy all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cThe director is filming a movie and he wants us to watch the scenario.\u201dKang So-ra said carefully.Seojun was already a very famous child actor, full of articles saying that many script are flying from Hollywood to him on the Internet.She wondered if she could say this.\u201cI want to see!\u201d\u2018I want to see a scene being directed!\u2019Seojun raised his hand when he heard it was a scenario.Whether his bright smile in Shadowman really remained impressive, or whether they could not believe in Seojun, who is still six years old, most of the scripts that came into Seo Eun-chan\u2019s side were just standing still and smiling.\u2018What\u2019s that? It\u2019s not fun. So I refused all of them.\u2019Seo Eun-hye also nodded.She quite liked this director. He didn\u2019t used their past ties to request Seojun to act for his film. Rather, he wanted him to see the scene first and judge it.In addition, he was a film director who they are quite familiar with. She was more inclined with him than others.\u201cThen can I give you the director\u2019s phone number? Or do you want me to send you his e-mail?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dFour years ago, a note with director Choi Dae-man\u2019s phone number, which was cherished for Seojun\u2019s future, was still in the notebook.However, it may have changed in this four years, so Seo Eun-Hye entered the number Kang So-ra gave her.Seo Eun-hye first informed Choi Dae-man of their available phone schedule by text.Lee Min-joon and Seojun wanted to actually participate on the phone call.After dinner, all of them gathered in front of their cell phone.Seo Eun-hye called a representative.\u201cOh, a mystery movie.\u201dSeojun and Lee Min-joon looked at Seo Eun-Hye, who was on the phone with Choi Dae-man.\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery movie.\u201d\u201cMystery?\u201dSeojun searched mystery genre movies with his dad.There were more genres than he thought. From haunted movies, there were supernatural powers or mystery stories.\u201cThere\u2019s a horror in it. If it\u2019s a horror movie, is it a ghost movie? Seojun, can you do it?\u201d\u201cYeah, will I be a ghost?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible. There was a time when a child appeared as a ghost in a Japanese movie. Or in the mystery movie, he was a victim.\u201d\u201cVictim?\u201d\u201cWell, someone who was being attacked by a villain?\u201dAs they talked about other movie, Seojun was slowly becoming interested in the genre itself.\u201cWhat role will Seojun play?\u201dSeo Eun-hye, who heard the answer, she quietly put down her cell phone.Lee Min-joon and Seojun, who were curious about the call with Choi Dae-man, snooped in front of Seo Eun-hye.Seo Eun-hye had a half-absorbed look on her face.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cMom, what\u2019s my role?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Seojun going to be a ghost? I thought it was a mystery movie.\u201dWas that so surprising?Seo Eun-hye, who was looking up and down at Seojun, opened her mouth.\u201cA shaman.\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201dAsked by Lee Min-joon, Seo Eun-hye said again.\u201cThe role of Seojun is going to be a shaman.\u201dA shaman?\u201cWhat\u2019s a shaman?\u201dWill Seojun act as a shaman.A child shaman?Lee Seojun, 6 years old.In this life, he had never seen a shaman on television, in newspapers, in fairy tales, or anywhere else.This was his first time hearing the word shaman.Seo Eun-hye printed the script she received from Choi Dae-man.It wasn\u2019t the entire script, but it was enough till Seojun\u2019s comes out.They also printed a file with the story of the child shaman set by Choi Dae-man.\u201cDo shamans wear clothes like this?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s colorful, right?\u201d\u201cAm I going to wear it?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201dMeanwhile, Lee Min-joon explained to Seojun about shamanism.When they searched the word shaman, there were a lot of pictures of people in colorful clothes while spreading their arms wide.Seojun looked at the picture with a big frown.\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201dLee Min-joon quickly changed to the next picture because he couldn\u2019t explain it. It was a picture of a child riding a horse.\u201cSeojun won\u2019t do this.\u201dThey know without looking at the script.Who would let a 6-year old child ride a horse?The next picture was not easy either.There was a dizzying afterimage of a shaman, probably taken while dancing like crazy.Lee Min-joon sighed.\u201cIs this a dance?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a religious dance.\u201d\u201cReligious?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a way to defeat bad ghosts in a human body. It\u2019s a dance that makes all the bad beings disappear.\u201dLee Min-joon explained to the best of his knowledge.Seojun blinked his eyes.\u201cWhat happened to the shaman?\u201d\u201cA very strong god possess the shaman\u2019s body. With that power, the shaman makes a miracle.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there a bad ghost when you get in there?\u201d\u201c\u2026Help!\u201d Lee Min-joon raised the white flag.Seojun had fun teasing him, so he laughed.He didn\u2019t know the word \u201cshaman,\u201d but he felt like he knew what it was after hearing his dad\u2019s story.He thought, it was like a priest or like an archangel.\u201cCome on, Seojun. Shall we read the script?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWhen everyone sat on the sofa, Seo Eun-hye slowly read the script.The amount of the shaman\u2019s scene was not long, but it was a very important role.Seo Eun-hye\u2019s voice, was soothing that it was like she was reading a fairy tale book before going to bed.She asked Seojun.\u201cWhat shall we do? Do you want to do it?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun nodded.Unlike other script, there were lines and not only blankly smiling.In addition, he will also appear at the climax of the movie.\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll call the director.\u201dSeo Eun-hye picked up her cell phone and called Choi Dae-man.Seojun took A4 paper script down and went to next to his father.Then, he climbed onto Lee Min-joon\u2019s lap and sat down.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cRead it with me. I have to memorize the lines!\u201dLee Min-joon, was surprised but he smiled and stroked Seojun\u2019s head.\u201cAre you practicing already? Okay.I\u2019ll help you.\u201dSeojun sat on Lee Min-joon\u2019s lap and looked at the script with his father in it. He skipped the scene and background description and went directly to read what he needed to know, such as the narration where it was written what would he do and his lines.\u201cSu-hyuk knocks on the door. He can\u2019t hear anything else. And\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow many times did Su-hyuk knock? The squeaky door opens, and the child shaman will come out. Is Su-hyuk a dragon?\u201d\u201cShaman.\u201d\u201cI heard there\u2019s a brave shaman.\u2026.\u201dLee Min-joon taught him part with consonant or difficult words.Seojun slowly read the script down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Choi Dae-man, raised his glass.\u201cCheers!\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, when are we going to meet the child actor?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see him next time.\u201d\u201cI wonder what kind of kid he is.\u201dNext to him, director Cho looked like he was itching to talk.He wanted to say it. He wanted to talk! However, he had no choice but to drink soju quietly because of Choi Dae-man, who was looking at him, as if warning him, from the next seat.\u201cHow was the audition for the child actor?\u201d\u201cDaebak!\u201d (TL: Awesome In Korean)Eventually, the assistant director, who couldn\u2019t stand it, opened his mouth to praised Seojun.But still didn\u2019t reveal who was the actor.\u201cWow! I am so frustrated! I am now curious who the director hired for the child actor role.\u201dLike children who curiously listen to old stories from their grandfathers, all the staff members\u2019 eyes gathered on the assistant director.\u201cWhen I first saw him, he was so handsome. He\u2019s small, but he speaks well and memorized the script. Well, there were a few people in the previous audition who did the same thing. But he is different.\u201dWhen the excited director Cho bragged about the actor, he still didn\u2019t reveal who it was, so the staff booed him.\u201cHe stood up. And from then on, I got goosebumps. He was very charismatic. He doesn\u2019t seem like a human being and so much aura was rising from that small body.\u201dEveryone swallowed their saliva.Lee Ji-seok, who will play a role together of the child shaman, also listened attentively.The assistant director got goosebumps just thinking about it then. He could clearly see what director Choi Dae-man said about the feeling of \u201cinner god.\u201d\u201cHe looked through the camera and put his head up and down, and I felt like a real shaman looking through. The Director Choi Dae-man shouted, \u201cYou\u2019ve passed!\u201d. I am really excited when he will come.\u201d\u201cSo who\u2019s the child actor?\u201dSomeone asked. Assistant Director Cho smiled.\u201cYou can\u2019t even imagine it. Our movie will be a hit!\u201d* * *\u201cIs this your first time hanging out with your uncle alone?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dKim Hee-sung drove carefully.Seojun was sitting in the rear car seat.In his arms, he held a bag shaped like a goblin doll.\u201cThe goblin doll drawn by Seojun is also very popular. Uncle and Seojun will be rich because I received a lot of orders.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll draw again next time!\u201dThe two were now heading to the filming site.Originally, Seo Eun-hye was going, but his maternal grandmother fell from the stairs two days ago.It wasn\u2019t a serious injury, but Seo Eun-hye decided to take care of her because she was old to stay alone in the hospital for a few days.\u2018What about the shooting?\u201dThat was Seo Eun-hye and Seojun\u2019s thought, the day before.But then they remembered his uncle Hee-sung.\u201cI signed a contract with a factory. How hard it must have been to find a good factory! I\u2019ve taken care of all the doll orders I\u2019ve been behind! Now I\u2019m free!\u201dKim Hee-sang boasted that. Lee Min-joon also nodded, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if it\u2019s Kim Hee-sung.\u201dThanks to this, Kim Hee-sung, who came to their house, was made as Seojun\u2019s guardian and manager for the shooting.\u201cYour uncle is going to make dolls with the pictures Seojun drew, and now you even invested the money earned from YouTube in your uncle\u2019s company, so I\u2019m going to do this.\u201dHee-sung thought it about before acting the manager position. Seojun was going to be his main advertiser anyway so he accompanied him.\u201cLet me get used to it this slowly because I have to go around with my manager instead of my mom and dad when I grow up.\u201dBefore he was thought as the manager of Seojun by Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon, they also thought about if they should find a good person who really knows acting. Hee-sung also helped them to find a suitable person. He thought about Eun-Chan.Was Eun-chan good at this? Kim Hee-sung recalled Seo Eun-chan working hard with Brown Black.Kim Hee-sang, who was driving, stopped the car.They arrived at their destination, Crow valley. Like the name Crow Valley, crows were flying around from the entrance of the village, crowing.\u201cLet\u2019s get off, Seojun.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun got out of the car.He held his uncle\u2019s hand with the goblin bag on his back.The two headed to the noisy and crowded place.One of the staff members moving the luggage, saw the child, who appeared to be the child actor, and ran towards the Director.Knowing that Seojun is finally here, the Director ran to the entrance and meet him.\u201cWelcome. Nice to meet you. I\u2019m a director, Park Jae-min.\u201d (Assistant Director Cho real name. Cho is like his nickname.)\u201cSeojun\u2019s guardian, Kim Hee-sung.\u201d\u201cHello!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m seeing Seojun again. Wasn\u2019t it hard?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201dFinally, the eyes of the staff who were organizing their luggage, look at Seojun.Who?Who is it?Do you know who it is?Where did you see him?The director smiled as brightly as if his mouth would rip. He shouted very loudly.\u201cI am going to direct a movie with Lee Seojun, a Hollywood child actor who starred as William in Marine\u2019s \u2018Shadowman.\u2019 He is now here!!!\u201dChoi Dae-man, who was walking towards them heard the assistant director\u2019s echoing voice.Kim Hee-sung and Seojun looked at him with puzzled faces. Isn\u2019t it that too much as an introduction?The assistant director looked proud as if he was the one that had gone to Hollywood.The staff, who listened to the director, stopped at what they were doing and stood blankly.Yet, he didn\u2019t stop and continued to brag.\u201cHe is Lee Seojun! The hottest one and only Korean Child actor!! Our movie will be a hit just by the news of the casting! Everyone is waiting for Lee Seojun\u2019s next film and it is going to be our movie! The Devil!\u201d\u201cStop it, you son of a bitch!\u201dIn the end, Choi Dae-Man hit the assistant director\u2019s back.His back hurt, but he felt cool inside.\u201cHahaha!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is this true? Is there perhaps a hidden camera filming this?Director Choi Dae-man, who saw the noisy staff, coughed awkwardly and introduced Seojun.\u201cThis is Lee Seojun, he will play the role of the child shaman possessed by the evil spirit. I look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201d\u201cHello! I\u2019m Lee Seojun!\u201dAs soon as he said his hello, the staff has been in disorder yet again.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cKyaaah so cute!\u201dMost of the screams came from Marine\u2019s fans.\u201cI\u2019ve watched Shadowman three times!\u201d\u201cThree times!? I\u2019ve watched it about ten times!\u201dEveryone gathered around Seojun.But they couldn\u2019t step any meter closer as Kim Hee-sung and Choi Dae-man was standing next to Seojun, acting as bodyguards.Everyone looked at Seojun with admiration. They couldn\u2019t believe the child actor from Marine\u2019s movie will act in their movie!It was a very strange feeling.Seojun was also excited to see people\u2019s eyes shining because of him.He never felt this before because he would only go home to and daycare center. Having people admire is really good.\u2018I feel like I am on the right track to become a star.\u2019At that time, Seojun found the staff holding something among the many staff members.It seems like they wanted autographs as they hurried to find any paper they could take like paper tissue, crumpled paper, and even the back of the script.Holding the papers and pens, everyone was only looking at the director Choi Dae-man. Choi Dae-man, who noticed the intention of the staff, looked at Kim Hee-sung, Lee Seojun\u2019s guardian.Even though there isn\u2019t many staff, wouldn\u2019t it be hard to sign all of them?In fact, Kim Hee-sung had no idea.Seojun already knows how to sign an autograph.Seojun recalled practicing hard with his mom and dad.\u2018Let\u2019s do it for the people that liked Seojun!\u2019\u2018Yes!\u2019\u201cUh.\u201dWhen Seojun opened his mouth, everyone became silent.\u201cYou want me to sign an autograph?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dEveryone answered altogether.One of the staff ran to take a box and brought a pile of clean paper and a pen. Another staff member brought a desk and a chair.At the audition, Assistant Director Cho, couldn\u2019t get his autograph due to the director\u2019s beaming eyes.Lee Ji-seok, the main actor of \u201cThe Evil Ghost,\u201d also lined up.Everyone was happy to get Seojun\u2019s autograph.Choi Dae-man sighed and opened his mouth.\u201cPlease keep it a secret that Lee Seojun will appear in this movie.\u201d\u201cWhy? It\u2019ll be a lot of publicity!\u201dThe Choi Dae-man shook his head at the staff\u2019s response.It\u2019s been a month since Shadowman went down from the cinema.The news about Seojun was also decreasing.However, if it was known that he was preparing for the next movie, it would be on the real-time search keyword immediately.The title was also expected.[The Hollywood actor chooses to act in a Korean movie!]\u201cIf it is known now, there will be a rush of reporters on the set, so the filming will be delayed. You don\u2019t want to stay up all night filming because the schedule is late, do you? His scene will be done in a few moments.\u201d\u201cAll right!\u201d\u201cAnd the production company is already preparing the movie promotion, so please keep it a secret. You all signed a confidentiality contract, didn\u2019t you?\u201dCome to think of it, they remembered signing the contract a month ago.They thought it was just about the movie, but it must have been about Lee Seojun. The staff, who tried to post it on SNS, gave up.\u201cDon\u2019t even let your family know. If you keep this secret until the movie is released, there will be a bonus!\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dAs expected, of the power the word \u2018bonus\u2019 can bring.\u201cThe contract is not the perfect solution,\u201d assistant director Cho said, and suggested a bonus.Then the staff pretended to put a zipper on their mouth.In the meantime, Seojun continued to sign autographs.He grabbed a black pen with his small hand and wrote his name hard.It was finally the last one.\u201cHi, Seojun. My name is Lee Ji-seok.\u201d\u201cHello, senior! I am Lee Seojun.\u201dThe day before coming here, Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon agonized over what title Seojun will use when referring to his older co-actors.(TL: Koreans has a culture that younger people should call the older one with a title)It was because Seojun was too young, and all the actors he met were older than him.If he calls them older brother or sister from the beginning, some people might think he was being arrogant just because he acted in a Marine\u2019s movie.The couple asked Seo Eun-chan for advice. Seo Eun-chan said \u201csenior\u201d is the most comfortable title.It was more of a career-oriented title than age.He then gave advice that comes from experience, saying, \u201cIt gets complicated when I know their ages.\u201d Perhaps, the couple, who assumed it was Kevin\u2019s story, and laughed.So Sejun decided to call him \u2018senior\u2019 and \u2018teacher\u2019 when he is older.Lee Ji-seok laughed. It was funny to be called senior by a little guy.\u201cJust call me brother.\u201d\u201cYes! Jiseok-Hyung! Should I sign, in Korean or English?\u201d\u201cCan you speak English already? You\u2019re just six years old.\u201d\u201cI learned from reading the script that my mom and dad\u2019s help me with.\u201d\u201cWell done! Then, I\u2019ll ask a sign in Korean.\u201d\u201cYes, wait a minute.\u201dSeojun wrote down the letters with his hand.As soon as everyone got their own autographs, they resumed working again. Along with the assistant director, Kim Hee-sung and Seojun headed towards the blue gatehouse where they decided to stay while filming.Assistant Director Cho opened one of the doors. Inside there was flower-patterned blankets and pillows prepared by the caretaker of this house.\u201cThe Grandma went to work in the field. This would be your waiting room. There are blankets and pillows. The bathroom is over there. You can take anything out from the kitchen refrigerator if you\u2019re hungry. This is the contact information of the staff and if you need anything, please contact me. The scene where Seojun comes out will be filmed at sunset, so take a good rest before that time.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cSleep tight so that Seojun doesn\u2019t get sleepy during the shoot.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dDirector Cho left the room and Kim Hee-sung opened the blanket.\u201cAren\u2019t you tired after riding the car for a long time?\u201d\u201cA little bit?\u201d\u201cThen will you take a nap? Let\u2019s get a good night\u2019s sleep, eat dinner, and go to the shoot.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun went straight into the flower-patterned blanket. He put his head on the pillow under the soft blanket. He didn\u2019t mean to, but\u2026[Summer Bear\u2019s hibernation is triggered]\u201cSeojun?\u201dHe fell asleep as soon as he put his head on the pillow.Even at Kim Hee-sung\u2019s call, Seojun slept well.\u201cWere you that tired?\u201dKim Hee-sung smiled and arranged Seojun\u2019s luggage.The sun has set.It was time to get ready for the shoot.Seojun, who woke up after a nap, had dinner prepared by the grandmother who came back from the fieldwork.\u201cIs it good?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun slept so soundly that he put in a mouthful of rice and side dishes and chewed them well.He started shooting an eating show from 8 months old and became a master of eating show.The Grandmother and Kim Hee-sung also scooped up a spoon of rice at the sight of Seojun eating very pleasantly.After dinner, Kim Hee-sung and Seo-joon talked about the monster drawing on Seomun\u2019s sketchbook until the staff called them out.\u201cIt\u2019s darker than this, but the crayons are 24 colors, so I colored it like this.\u201d\u201cSo this color is enough?\u201dKim Hee-sung showed the color of one of the color tags from his cell phone. Seojun nodded.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cNext, it\u2019s this. What\u2019s this? Fur?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a feather.\u201dSeojun explained slowly.Kim Hee-sang listened carefully and wrote down some notes.Knock knock-\u201cYes, come on in.\u201dA staff wearing a hat quietly opened the door and made eye contact with Seojun, who was busy explaining while drawing on a sketchbook.\u201cAre you up already?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cPerfect! It\u2019s time to shoot. You can come over there.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In July, it was hot in the day within Seoul, but the night was cool.\u201cYou might get cold if the filming gets any later.\u201dKim Hee-sung entered the room and brought a blanket and a hand warmer.Seojun and Kim Hee-sung talked and headed towards the mansion in the village full of slate roofs as if to maintain the form of hanok. (TL: Hanok is a traditional Korean house.)Walking along the fence of the hanok, it seemed like a huge house.\u201cI heard from the grandmother, while Seojun was sleeping, that the owner\u2019s of this house are very smart people. All of them were famous doctors, judges, lawyers. Do you think it\u2019ll be a good place?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s about this place?\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s a mountain over there, right? There\u2019s a river in front of us. The freshness of the mountain and the sound of the river gather in this hanok and give strength to the people who live here. It could be the power to make a lot of money, or it could be the power to make people born smart.\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes followed Kim Hee-sung\u2019s finger pointing at the mountain and then to the river.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dThey also talked about the structure of hanok. Kim Hee-sung had a lot of miscellaneous knowledge, so Seojun could hear many interesting stories.As they walked while talking, they arrived at the filming location.Choi Dae-man, who was talking to Lee Ji-seok, found the two people, a man and a boy, and approached them.\u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t it late for your age?\u201d\u201cI already took a nap!\u201d\u201cYeah, good job.\u201d\u201cThe dressing room is this way, so do you want to come with me?\u201dLee Ji-seok went into a tent with Seojin. There were many clothes hanging and there were large mirrors and chairs.Lee Ji-seok and Seojun sat on the chair as guided by the staff.\u201cYou mustn\u2019t talk.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSeojun\u2019s answer while zipping his mouth closed. His actions was so cute that the staff didn\u2019t know what to do.The staff, who won rock-paper-scissors as Seojun\u2019s make-up artist, carefully moved the brush.Lee Ji-seok seemed to have become a cold rice meal for some reason.(TL: Got attention when they started but when a new one arrived the attention wasn\u2019t on him anymore. Because most east Asian like rice if there is a cold and hot rice in front, most of them will choose the hot one.)\u201cIt looks good on you.\u201dSeojun came out in his clothes. It was a white robe for the child shaman to sleep in.Seojun smoothed his robe.Although he wore Hanbok on New Year\u2019s Day or Chuseok, he had never worn such white clothes.Kim Hee-sung touched the fabric of the robe. Wasn\u2019t it a little thin?\u201cAre you cold?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cTell me if you are cold, okay?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLee Ji-seok came out after his makeup. He was now Su-hyuk, who was attacked by evil spirits in Seoul, his costume will be the same until he came to this village.\u201cWow!\u201dSeojun opened his eyes wide.Lee Ji-seok really looks like someone has beat him up.His face was covered with scars and one eye was bruised as if it were really swollen.His clothes were tattered as if they were rugs. Kim Hee-sung was also surprised by the movie\u2019s special makeup.\u201cWow, it really looks real.\u201d\u201cThis is how good our team is.\u201dAssistant Director Cho, who had already come out, showed off their staffs capabilities.He then guided the two actors and Kim Hee-sung to the filming location.\u201cWe\u2019re only going to check the movement for the rehearsal. Both actors are very good at acting, so the director said that you would only require a small. Besides, this scene will need a full shot, a bust shot and a close-up shot, it\u2019s not good to relax during rehearsals.\u201dThe first filming location was in front of the large wooden gate of the hanok.There were already several cameras and lights installed, and Choi Dae-man, who was checking the background with a monitor, got up from his seat.\u201cSeojun and Ji-seok look good together. Shall we check the route first?\u201dChoi Dae-man gave details. Seojun and Lee Ji-seok were all familiar with the story, but they listened carefully.Meanwhile, Kim Hee-sung crossed the gate and entered the yard.This side was also equipped with cameras and lights to film Seojun.\u201cLet\u2019s get started!\u201dSimply after the rehearsal, the main filming began.The camera turned on and everyone stood in their position.Seojun, dressed in white robes, stood in front of a large wooden gate.Seojun\u2019s role is a child shaman with a scary god inside him. (TL:Not entirely possessed but he is the container of the God.)There were very few lines, but on the other hand there was a lot of expressions needed.Before the director\u2019s signal, Seojun lick his lips looking at the wooden door.\u201cMr. Kim, let\u2019s play.\u201d[Bell goblin\u2019s teasing Mr. Kim]***[Bell goblin\u2019s teasing Mr. Kim]The energy of a bell goblin comes out.It can change the shape of the energy.With the power of shaman bells, they can predict the future of Mr. Kim very rarely.Start: Mr. Kim, let\u2019s play. (TL: The trigger)Cancel: Stop teasing Mr. Kim. (TL: to stop the skill)* * *The Bell goblin was a little goblin born from the old shaman\u2019s bell.The bell goblin lived for making fun of Mr. Kim.He also used to mimic the dark sun by emitting energy to make his body seems twice or thrice larger, or by making the yellow-colored energy black.There was Mr. Kim who frequently visited the mountain where the bell goblin lived, and he surprised him for several times.\u201cIsn\u2019t it time you got used to it, Mr. Kim?\u201d\u201cWould you get used to it?\u2019\u2019The bell goblin, who revealed its identity, sometimes received acorn jelly from Mr. Kim.\u2018\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve seen this somewhere\u2026\u2026.\u2019\u2018Hehehe.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s mine, isn\u2019t it?\u201dOne day, very rarely, the bell goblin saw the future of Mr. Kim. The bell goblin thought it was very fortunate.Knowing that Mr. Kim was about to die, the goblin jumped in and save him.\u201cHey! What about you?\u201d\u2018I\u2019ve already outlived Mr. Kim.\u2019For a goblin, who sacrificed his life instead, Mr. Kim held a memorial service of the broken shaman bells in an old tree.\u201cNext time I see you, I\u2019ll scold you.\u201d* * *Something moved in the middle of his chest. Seojun brought out what he had practiced for a month and a half.The goblin\u2019s energy was put into his body in a human form. Like there\u2019s really something inside.He had a hard time creating this form. It looked like a person, but it wasn\u2019t supposed to be a person, and it was inside him, but it had to appear to some extent outside.It was shaped like clay, but somehow he created it with long limbs and scary eyes.\u2013 Ready.Director Choi Dae-man\u2019s voice sounded very small compared to when he filmed Shadowman.Perhaps because he grew up a little, he could think a little bit unlike when he was sucked in without realizing it.\u2018Oh, I guess we\u2019re starting now.\u2019It was only this much.-Action!The child shaman\u2019s god was a very terrible god.He didn\u2019t even give his name, but he had that much power.Rumors about the child shaman circulated only inside the village.The great power of God made it so.The power of God, who did not go outside, kept accumulating in the body of the child shaman.Boom boom!Before they knew it.Boom boom!The child shaman opened the wooden gate. A man breathing heavily was now before his eyes.The man was covered with wounds.One leg was limp and his eyes were swollen. The child shaman knew who caused this man to be in that state that.\u201cI heard there\u2019s a brave shaman here.\u2026.\u201dHe stopped talking for a mtalkinThe child shaman looked up and down from the man\u2019s head to his toes.\u2018An evil thing.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s it. That killed your parents.\u2019The child shaman saw what was swirling in the man\u2019s body.The black devil smiled and cried at him like a dancing flame, and at the end of the day, he could see his parents dying quietly, holding their breath, fearing that the baby would come with them.Boom!The child shaman closed the wooden gate. \u2018It\u2019s not the time yet.\u2019\u201cCut! Okay!\u201dTurning around, Seojun breathed out lightly and muttered.\u201cStop teasing Mr. Kim.\u201dHee-sung, who was outside from the cameras range, quickly ran to lwards Seojun and put him around the blanket and gave him a hand warmer.\u201cAre you okay, Seojun?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay! I\u2019m more worn out on Shadowman than on this scene.\u201dFortunately, after six months, his \u201cbody\u201d grew a lot and now there was quite a bit of strength left.\u201cThat\u2019s how focused you are. Well done.\u201dKim Hee-sung patted Seojun on the head, lifted him up and headed to Choi Dae-man.They talked in advance while monitoring the scene they filmed that after the director\u2019s okay, Hee-sung should run towards Seojun.Kim Hee-sang pushed the wooden gate. Hmm?It was heavier than he thought. He needed a little more force to open the door.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty heavy. Was Seojun this strong? It isn\u2019t easy to push.\u201d\u201cNo, it was very easy.\u201dSeojun pretended to open and close the door, saying, \u201cLike this, like this.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dKim Hee-sung clasped his hand a few times and looked at the wooden gate.A pretty big wooden door was now tightly closed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The evil spirit in Su-hyuk\u2019s body seemed to have felt the power of God from the child shaman across the door. As expected, of veterans actors, they know how to act well.\u201dBoom boom!The door opened. It looked quite thick when knocking, but it opened lightly.Then a child in a white hanbok appeared.\u201cI heard there\u2019s a brave shaman here.\u2026.\u201dThe original line was supposed to end there, but Lee Ji-seok, no, Su-hyuk, stopped talking without realizing it.Two pairs of eyes were looking at him.One is the sparkling eyes of the child shaman. And the other was the eyes of something he couldn\u2019t see but felt.Choi Dae-man, who was watching in the monitor, did not feel as much as Lee Ji-seok. But he knew something that wasn\u2019t human was there, because he felt what was Lee Ji-seok is feeling now, back in Seojun\u2019s audition. It really feels like there\u2019s something inside Seojun.There were some staff members who felt something foreign coming from the child and others who did not, but everyone held their breath at Seojun and Lee Ji-seok\u2019s acting.The silence created by the two actors alone raised a mysterious atmoy.The child shaman\u2019s head moved slowly from Su-hyuk\u2019s head to his feet.Su-hyuk couldn\u2019t come to his senses because of that creepy eyes looking inside him.Su-hyuk felt that the evil spirit in him was dancing.His blood seemed to be moving all over his body in order to increase the beat of his pounding heart.He could feel his heartbeat coming from his toes to his fingertips.At the end, even his head was pounding.The chikd shaman\u2019s eyes soon were away from him.Boom!The door is now closed.\u201cCut! Okay!\u201dHe could hear the director\u2019s voice, but Su-hyuk, no, Lee Ji-seok, was just looking at the door in that posture.When the actor didn\u2019t move, other staff members quietly rolled their eyes.When the door opened, Lee Ji-seok took two steps back without realizing it.\u201cOh, were you still filming?\u201dWhen Kim Hee-sung, Lee Seojun\u2019s guardian, appeared, Lee Ji-seok came to his senses.It was because he could see Seojun smiling brightly and waving at him within Kim Hee-sang\u2019s arms. Unlike before, where he felt like he has four eyes.\u201cThey both did a great job! Now get some rest while we prepare you for your next shoot.\u201dAs Director Choi Dae-man said, Seojun had to take close-up shots and bust shots.In order to catch the realistic expressions of the two actors, the two actors sat in chairs and waited for the shooting while the staff installed cameras near the wooden gate.Lee Ji-seok, who saw Seojun drinking cocoa while sitting in a chair, opened but closed his mouth immediately when he couldn\u2019t utter the words he was thinking.\u2018How did you do that? How can you act like that?\u2019He was like a much more experienced veteran actor than him and not just a small child who just started acting.\u2018No, can an average actor even do that?\u2019As Lee Ji-seok kept staring at him, Seojun put down his cocoa cup and smoothed his face.\u201cWell, do you have something to say?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dLee Ji-seok shook his head.\u2018So, there here was an actor of that sort.\u2019An actor with a talent from heaven, @n actor by nature.Such talent was not understandable to the average person just by explaining it in words.It was no different from \u201cI studied only by following the textbook.\u201dNo, in this case, he thought it would work, so he tried it, but it worked.Lee Ji-seok sighed deep inside.Still, acting with such an actor has improved his acting also.He was able to take a step forward just by playing the opposite role without losing to Seojun\u2019s overwhelming performance.Lee Ji-seok laughed. \u2018If you can\u2019t learn by the book, you should learn by stealing.\u2019\u201cThe next shoot begins!\u201dLee Ji-seok and Seojun, who got up from their seats, headed back to the set.After all the filming was over on the day, the actors returned to their accommodation and the staff stayed to arrange the equipment.The camera director was left dumbfounded, seeing his expression Director Choi Dae-man said to him.\u201cAt how actor Lee Ji-seok acted, Seojun never lost. They were acting like fireworks.\u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIn my eyes was the opposite, Ji-seok didn\u2019t want to lose to Seojin.\u201d* * *The next dayThe filming of the scene where Seojun appears ended quickly.The child shaman put the bells and amulets in order to exorcise the evil spirit.He also filmed a scene with a grandfather living with a the child shaman.It was a time-independent scene, so it was all over by lunch.Unlike Seojun, there were many scenes that Lee Ji-seok needed to film.It was because Su-hyuk was filming a scene where he heard the story of the child shaman from his grandfather who lived with him, and a scene where Su-hyuk tried to leave the village while the evil spirit tried to stay in the village to avoid being harmed by the baby shaman.\u201cGrandmother, it\u2019s delicious!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201dSeojun and Kim Hee-sung, who decided to visit the village, were caught by the grandmother from their accomodations and accepted her proposal to eat the hand-made noodles.There weren\u2019t many ingredients in the noodles, but it was really good.Seojun diligently ate the noodles.\u201cThe baby eats well.\u201d\u201cI am Seojun!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dTheir filming seemed to have gathered all the villagers\u2019 attention as it was the talk of the town.A grandfather stopped drinking rice wine and said, \u201cI heard you\u2019re filming. Where can I watch it? On Television?\u201d\u201cWe are shooting a movie. You\u2019ll have to watch it at the movie theater.\u201d\u201cThe movie theater should out of town\u2026\u201d\u201cBut we will be going out of town, so let\u2019s watch when we have time!\u201d\u201cWith your car and that carriage over there, we\u2019ll be able to get there, right?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a big car in this house, but only four could go inside!\u201dEveryone started to set a date to go to the movies. Grandmother said.\u201cWhat movie is all about?\u201dKim Hee-sung agonized for a while. Exorcist? God?\u201cA movie that defeats bad ghosts!\u201dIn the meantime, Seojun replied.\u201cBad ghost?\u201dThe villagers tilted their heads.\u201cThere\u2019s a shaman, there\u2019s a pastor. It\u2019s that kind of movie. Should I call it a ritual?\u201d\u201cOh, a shaman!\u201d\u201cThe shaman next door was very good.\u201dSoon, the theme changed from the movie to the shaman\u2019s story.Kim Hee-sung and Seojun quickly declined when their grandmother tried to give them another ladle after seeing the bowl where Kim Hee-sung and Seojun ate was finished. Honestly, they ate too much.Seojun and Kim Hee-sung, who decided to go to see Shenyangdang (TL: a type of tree) at the corner of the village, got up from their seats andbid goodbye to the villagers and left.Grandfather, who was pouring the rice wine into a bowl after Seojun and Kim Hee-sung left, said. \u201cIf the shaman from the next village was still there, I\u2019d ask him to look at my grandchild\u2019s fortune.\u201d\u201cOh, your grandson came to visit you the day before yesterday, right?\u201dThe villagers recalled the grandson of Granpa Choi.He grew up in his grandfather\u2019s house until he was 10 years old.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t even had lunch. Where is he shooting?\u201d\u201cI went to Shenyangdang this morning.Will he come late again tonight?\u201d\u201cIt must be hard to live in Seoul.\u201dEveryone held up their rice wine cups and drank them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he looked up, it was really huge.Red, blue, yellow, and white cloths were tied to each branch and drooping toward the floor.The wooden pillars were surrounded by stone walls.Kim Hee-sung picked up the camera and stood from afar.\u201cSeojun, look at the camera!\u201d\u201cSay, Kimchi!\u201dKim Hee-sung was taking pictures of Seojun for Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon.Seojun, positioned himself where he could look up to the tree.Large branches stretched out into the sky and wooden pillars were thick.The long colored cloth reminded him of some memories.The tomb of the goblin looked like this!\u2018No way! Is it here?\u2019With twinkling eyes, Seojun walked slowly around Shenyangdang.Kim Hee-sung worked hard to take pictures of it as if he was really a photographer.Seojun searched here and there, but there was no hole around the tree.\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201dHe was a little bit disappointed.He thought that this was the same as it was from his life as a goblin.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNothing!\u201dSeojun ran back to Kim Hee-sang.\u201cUncle! Let\u2019s go to the mountain!\u201dPerhaps, the mountain could be the same one?It may have changed after a long time, but when he was bored for a month and a half, the mountain he went as goblin really look like this.He read the book of the goblin from the library of life and the description is exactly the same.\u201cLet\u2019s do it. There are a lot of rocks here, so you can\u2019t run.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun and Kim Hee-sung slowly walked to the path next to Shenyangdang.The sun was covered by branches and leaves, not even walking for a few minutes they are now close to the mountain.\u201cAs expected, the shade under here is cool.\u201d\u201cHey! There are flowers!\u201dSeojun found flowers near the tree.It was nice to see a bed of flowers in the outside like this.Seojun pointed at the flowers while jumping around excitedly.He found a bird, too.There was also a squirrel.Kim Hee-sung, who was looking at where Seojun was pointing, said: \u201cAt this rate, maybe a boar will come out too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pheasant!\u201d\u201cPheasant?! What if a wild boar really comes out?\u201dSeojun stopped walking on the street and went looking for other animals.Whoosh!They turned their heads towards the sound.They heard something through the gentle wind.There seemed to be something amidst the tree branches, maybe a bird.Seojun looked up around like a rabbit that pricked its ears up.Kim Hee-sung, who was diligently following Seojun, called Seojun curiously.\u201cSeojun?\u201d\u201cShh!\u201dSeojun was concentrating, he was using his ears so he hear from far away.There was something. But it was so small that he couldn\u2019t measure the direction where it came from.\u201cMr. Kim.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s play.\u201d[Bubbly goblin\u2019s teasing of Mr. Kim]Seojun scattered his goblin\u2019s energy like a bat\u2019s ultrasound.It was a method that he came up with after watching animal documentaries while thinking about ways to create inner forms to use them more.It should only be Mr. Kim who could react to this energy.Seojun focused his attention.It wasn\u2019t that much energy because he was still a kid.It could only reach a short distance from such a large place.So Seojun decided to walk around, being the center.Hee-sung was behind him, so he was confident of going to walk as far as he could, but he couldn\u2019t hear anything else.There must be someone in a dangerous situation.Seojun, who changed his mind soon. He left the road and walked deep into the mountain, away from the trail.\u201cSeojun?!\u201dKim Hee-sung called Seojun, who left the trail and went to a place other than the road.\u201cUncle! Don\u2019t worry I am not running!\u201d The little child roamed around like a squirrel.Kim Hee-sung quickly followed Seojun\u2019s footsteps.The road was rough and it was hard to catch up with how fast Seojun was.\u201cI am gonna get in trouble!\u201dThe energy of the softly flowing goblin aura was blocked in one place. Seojun quickly headed there.\u201cFound it!\u201d\u201cSeojoon, you! You are making trouble for your uncle!\u201d\u201cUncle! Here! There\u2019s a person!\u201d\u201cTo you mom and dad\u2026\u2026.What?!\u201dKim Hee-sung was surprised by Seojun\u2019s words and came running at once to where he was.Seojun crouched down.There was a pit. It was 3 meter deep, and inside there was a boy with his eyes closed. One leg of the boy was bent.Seojun was trying to observe the boy by sticking his head inside the pit, but Kim Hee-sung quickly covered Seojun\u2019s eyes.\u2018Is he dead?\u2019 Hee-sung thought and bit his lips.\u201cSeojun, is he..\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat older brother has his heart still beating, his leg is the only thing hurt!\u201dWhen Seojun stick out his head, the first thing he noticed was the chest of the kid moving up and down.At those words, Kim Hee-sung sighed with relief.\u201cCall for help uncle, call 119!\u201d\u201cYeah, wait a minute.\u201dAt Seojun\u2019s urging, Kim Hee-sung quickly picked up his cell phone. He didn\u2019t call 119 m immediately, he first called assistant director Cho.\u201cOh, assistant director. There was an accident with a child here. No, it\u2019s not Seojun. He look like a kid from the village, but he is stuck in a pit\u2026\u2026. I think he just fainted. One of his legs is bent. I think we should call the villagers and call an ambulance. I\u2019m at the back of Shenyangdang, just walk a little further into the mountain\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhile Kim Hee-sung directed the way via phone, Seojun covered the boy with the goblin\u2019s energy like a blanket because the kid\u2019s lips were turning blue.Seojun covered the pit with the remaining energy so that the cold wind wouldn\u2019t get in. Now the kid wouldn\u2019t feel any cold.The boy\u2019s face looks better as soon as he got warmer.If Seojun had more power, he could have done many things.But with his current power, he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off from the boy.\u201cSeojun, you should be careful.\u201dKim Hee-sung quickly lifted Seojun because he leaned in more towards the pit. Hee-sung was afraid that Seojun would fell like the kid inside.Soon after, people appeared with director Choi Dae-man.Everyone looked towards the pit to see the boy stuck inside.\u201cLet\u2019s get in there and get him out!\u201d\u201cIf you mess with him, he would be shocked somewhere else, and he will be in an even worse position!\u201d\u201cWait\u2026 ha\u2026. haa\u2026Well\u2026look, I\u2019m a doctor.\u201dHe was the stranger who\u2019s gasping for air because he run in order to get here as soon as he heard there was an accident. But now he is out of air.\u201cHe is the son of the Korean traditional house owner. He is here to watch the shooting.\u201dWith the help of a doctor, the boy was safely rescued and taken to a nearby hospital.After the uproar, the filming team started filming again.Seojun also took a nap, had dinner, and headed to the set because there was a night scene.\u201cIt might be a little hard today.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s too hard, we\u2019ll split it up today and tomorrow.\u201dAssistant Director Cho nodded at Director Choi\u2019s words.\u201cOh, they are coming. The Actors.\u201dLee Ji-seok and Seojun appeared at the filming site already dressed up.Assistant Cho and Choi Dae-man welcomed the two actors.The scene of eradicating the evil spirits, which will be the finale of \u201cThe Devil,\u201d and it will be filmed in the hanok yard.Equipment installed will give out the effects to show the power of the child shaman and evil spirits.There was machine with air.There was also flaming device.Director Choi Dae-man talked to the two actors and explained the order of operation with the installed equipment step by step.Seojun asked questions frequently because he was amazed to see what kind of scene will happen with the machines.The staff, who were checking the amulet-shaped devices that would light up, quietly talked to each ither.\u201cIsn\u2019t a little weird to act in a place like this?\u201d\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t as weird as Redborn. The actors there actors needed to act with giant equipment covered in green and sensors on their clothes. Most of the attacks are also CG, so they just stretch out their arms. It\u2019s actually great to act in such a situation without a hitch.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dTheybwoukd now be filming battle between the evil spirits and God.The staff, who were installing the devices, thought that unlike the other movies with colorful CGs, the acting of the two actors with no effect might be a little awkward.\u201cIt may be awkward when they are acting now, but after the CG work and editing it will make it look great. Please act as naturally as possible. Well, let\u2019s take a full shot first.\u201dWhen everyone headed to their seats, Choi Dae-man called Seojun.\u201cWhen Seojun speaks, you have to give enough time for the inner god\u2019s line to go in.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun nodded at director Choi Dae-man\u2019s words and went to his seat and stood.Cameras and lights were now prepared, and Lee Ji-seok can act anytime.Seojun whispered quietly.\u201cLet\u2019s play, Mr. Kim.\u201d[Bubbly goblin\u2019s teasing of Mr. Kim]The energy in his body moved gently.The human-like energy couldn\u2019t resist the playfulness and danced limply.\u201cReady!\u201d\u2018It was time to let go of this energy.

I should\u2019ve eaten you back then.]The demon who took over the man\u2019s body chuckled.The child shaman has become the prey of all kinds of ghosts since birth, as the power he inherited from his father and mother is so strong.It was his mom and dad who kept the ghosts away.The child shaman recalled the faces of the two people within his hazy memory.The two, who were always smiling, were driven away by the evil spirit.[But what\u2019s in you?]The wind blew fast.With just one word, the evil spirit released enough power to shake the shaman\u2019s robe roughly.The evil spirit was runnung wild.[This is what I was aiming for! I\u2019ve been waiting for it to taste better!]The child shaman\u2019s shaman bells shook loudly and made a clattering sound.[Who took you before me?]The evil spirit screamed as if his mouth were tearing.But the child shaman remained still.He just waited for the right moment.The god inside him whispered.<Wait a little longer. Be patient. Patient.>\u2018Not yet.\u2019The child shaman thought so, too.The evil spirit ran wild.That evil spirit knew it, too. They had to open that child\u2019s mouth and make him use his strength.\u201cHuck!\u201d[You!]\u201cHahaha!\u201dWhen the evil spirit gained strength, Su-hyuk took over his body again.His body, which was controlled by the evil spirit, fell to the floor like a puppet.The evil spirit whispered to Su-hyuk, who was barely breathing.[It\u2019s just him. The only thing that can get me out from you. Beg! Beg! Beg! Beg him to get rid of me.]Su-hyuk slowly calmed down.The child shaman looked at Su-hyuk with an expressionless face, but sad eyes.That man was suffering from evil spirits like his mother and father.The God said to the child shaman. <Wait. We have to wait.>\u2018But. He\u2019s hurt. We need to heal him.\u2019<You\u2019re too soft-hearted. That\u2019s why I chose you.>God laughed. When the child shaman first saw Su-hyuk, he closed the door quickly because he thought he would reach out to him unconsciously if he watched him more.But he needed to wait.Recalling the death of his parents, the hesitant child shaman nodded at the firm words of God, who took care of him like he was his child.Su-hyuk saw a child shaman.His body was in pain and his soul was also in pain, but he didn\u2019t open his mouth.He just looked at the child shaman with pitiful eyes.[Beg! He\u2019s so soft hearted that he\u2019ll make you feel comfortable as soon as you ask! Like this!]A moment of comfort came to Su-hyuk\u2019s body.Yes, he was now in a state before he was possessed by evil spirits.[You want to be comfortable, don\u2019t you? You want to go back to normal, don\u2019t you?]The evil spirit shouted.[Then beg!]The stormy wind shook the shaman\u2019s bell, which the child shaman was holding, with a crazy sound.The sound of the rattling bells hurt his ears, but no one covered them.Su-hyuk smirked. He couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, giggled and opened his mouth.\u201cLittle boy.\u201dAt Su-hyuk\u2019s call, the child shaman opened and then closed his mouth. Su-hyuk saw the child shaman.The eyes of the child shaman were slightly shaken, resembling his father.\u201cDo what you have to do.\u201d<Now.>God whispered.The moon was up.The child shaman looked up at the sky.The bright yellow full moon looked down on the yard like the eyes of an animal.It was a full moon.The child shaman lowered his head and saw Su-hyuk and the evil spirit in it.God said.<And it\u2019s now your birthday.>Three years ago, in the same date, his mom and dad died.The child shaman raised both hands.The gold shaman bells used by the mother in his right hand and the red-letter amulet used by the father in his left hand.Things that are imbued with the energy of two people\u2019s energy.He had a hard time carrying out something.[No way!]At the same time as God\u2019s words, the evil spirit that occupied Su-hyuk\u2019s body again shouted.Su-hyuk\u2019s soul grabbed the body trying to run to the child shaman.He thought his whole body was going to rip apart.\u201cDarn it! That kid hasn\u2019t spoken, he hasn\u2019t cried, he hasn\u2019t laughed in three years! You\u2019re only seven years old! Laughing and crying should be the only thing for a kid!\u201d[Get out of my way!]\u201cIf you want to go, kill him! You son of a bitch!\u201dJingle.It was windy.It blew very hard with the power of evil spirits.But the child shaman\u2019s bell cried quietly and briefly.Jingle.With the help of God, the child shaman infused three years worth of power into both the talismans and bells.There was a huge aura behind the child shaman.The power of God, which resembles the yellow moonlight, exploded from the child shaman\u2019s body.With the golden wind, the child shaman\u2019s hanbok shook.Something big hugged the child shaman.He was engulfed by the enormous power of God, but he felt warm on one of his hand.The child shaman picked up the amulet.The talisman, shaken by the wind, stood stiffly.The red spell on the talisman sparkled.For the first time, a baby shaman uttered a spell that God had been muttering to him for three years.\u201cTo heaven and earth, there should be rain.\u201d[No way!]\u201cI can\u2019t go!\u201dSu-hyuk\u2019s body went crazy by itself.If he took a step forward with the power of evil spirits, he will fall on the floor due to the willpower of Su-hyuk.In the meantime, Su-hyuk, who closed the right eye of his body, looked at the child shaman, who was shedding tears little by little.Su-hyuk\u2019s eyes were warm.\u201cA humble being is a poor thing.\u201d[ [email\u00a0protected] ^&amp;%&amp;@!!!!]<Now, this is the last one.>God whispered.The child shaman knew everything because a god who knew everything came into his body.The child shaman stopped the evil spirit and saw Su-hyuk covered with wounds.Tears blocked his view.If Su-hyuk had asked for it as the evil spirit said, the chikd shaman would have listened to Su-hyuk\u2019s request and been eaten by the evil spirit.But Su-hyuk didn\u2019t do that instead.If the child shaman defeated the evil spirit, Su-hyuk woukd have died. Su-hyuk was a good person. He can\u2019t die like this.<As expected, you\u2019re too soft.>The sighing god showed the child shaman a different future.The eyes of the child shaman, who had been blurred with tears, sparkled.<How is it?>\u2018Good!\u2019<I\u2019m disappearing.>\u2018Even if I don\u2019t see you, you\u2019ll be there for me!\u2019God raised his hands. <You can\u2019t beat him.>A foreign voice intervened in the voice of the the child shaman.\u201cLet the great soul be upon this body.\u201dA talisman on the left hand of the child shaman flew away and surrounded the evil spirit.And then it caught fire.The child shaman grabbed the bell with both hands.[!#$^#!!!!!]\u201cGood job.\u201dThe child shaman shook the bell with all his might.Jingle!\u201cThe power to burn the dull evil!\u201dA golden aura in the moonlight rushed to the evil spirit like a golden animal.Su-hyuk twisted his whole body in the golden flame.The evil spirit shouted. Screamed.Su-hyuk screamed out of pain at his soul burning in the hot fire.Jingle!\u201cThe power to destroy that source!\u201dThe fire, as if made of gold, grew stronger. With the power disappearing, the black devil struggled to escape from Su-hyuk\u2019s body. Su-hyuk\u2019s soul has snatched away the evil spirits trying to escape from this place.\u201cThanks to you, I know how to handle the soul!\u201d[!#%#$&amp;@!!!!]The evil spirit, who could not escape from Su-hyuk\u2019s hand or God\u2019s hand, died while screaming.The golden flame, which had ceased to burn, soon calmed down after circling around Su-hyuk like a beast looking for food.The yard, which was full of screams earlier, soon quieted down.As the result.It\u2019s gone now.When the pain was over, Su-hyuk collapsed to the floor and also the child shaman collapsed.He looked at Su-hyuk, who collapsed, for the last time with his eyes full of tears.\u201cCut, okay!\u201dHis mind came back to reality at director Choi Dae-man\u2019s voice.Seojun looked at his hand.How hard did he held the handle of the bell, that the red mark remained intact?He felt more immersed than when he practiced at home.Seojun carefully put his hand on his chest. His heart thumped.[The illusion of the mushroom smiley face] was triggered automatically, so even if Seojun was into acting, he could use it without worrying.But this time it was different.Unlike the first shooting, which allowed him to stay still, he had to exhale and disappear with his whole bodies.He even had to act while controlling the energy of a goblin.So Seojun dive deep into immersed acting and practiced expelling the goblin\u2019s energy to the point where he got used to it, in case he forgot to use [Bubbly Goblin\u2019s Teasing of Mr. Kim].\u201cBut, it went better than I thought.\u201dSeojun laughed.\u201cGasp!\u201dLee Ji-seok, who was lying on the floor, breathed heavily.Then he slowly straightened himself up.Seojun found Lee Ji-seok covered in dirt. Jiseok was really good at acting. He felt that he was really possessed by a real evil spirit.The moment Seojun approached Lee Ji-seok and asked if he was okay,Clap clap clap clap!Clap clap clap clap!\u201cWow!\u201dApplause broke out among the staff.They pplaud to the only two actors in the scene, also to the directors and assistant director guiding the scene.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seojun\u2019s red hanbok gently moved along with the wind.\u201cLong time no see, child. How appetizing did you became now? I should have eaten you then.\u201dLee Ji-seok said with a rough voice and giggled.\u201cBut, what\u2019s in you? I should be the one eating you! I\u2019ve been waiting until you tasted better!\u201dThe shaman bell Seojun was holding shook loudly and made a clattering sound.Lee Ji-seok sounded even harsher.The staff from the side got goosebumps at his voice.\u201cWho took you before me?\u201dSince there was no line from Seojun, Lee Ji-seok had to find the right timing.He needed to give time for the child shaman and God to talk.Somehow, Lee Ji-seok felt like he could hear their conversation through Seojun\u2019s expression.Seojun\u2019s expression was a bit hesitant right now.\u201cHuck!\u201dLee Ji-seok fell to the floor.\u201cHahaha!\u201dHere comes the voice of the evil spirit, and Seojun looked at Lee Ji-seok with pitiful eyes.Again.Even though it was just a facial expression, Lee Ji-seok seemed to hear Seojun and God talking.Everyone held their breath.He saw the script that one of the staff was holding. The staff next to him read the script.God: Wait. We have to wait.Child shaman: But. He\u2019s hurt. I need to heal him.God: You are too soft-hearted. That\u2019s why I choose you. But wait.\u201cWow. How could he do that?\u201dIn Seojun\u2019s facial expression, the lines of God and the child shaman seemed to be heard.\u201cBeg! He is so soft that he\u2019ll make you feel comfortable as soon as you ask! Like this! You want to be comfortable, don\u2019t you? You want to go back to normal, don\u2019t you?\u201dLee Ji-seok was even more fired up, as he could go all the way there with his facial expression.He was now immersed to his role from hand to toe.Jingle!The shaman\u2019s bell shook and Lee Ji-seok was immersed in evil acting.The director Choi Dae-man, and some staff members of the staff saw it from the monitor.A golden aura emanated from the body of a small child standing behind a hanok. The power of [Bubbly Goblin\u2019s teasing of Kim] was being revealed outside.A pitch-dark night.The gold color wrapped around Lee Seojun.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026.\u201dA staff member who saw it pointed at Lee Seojun with his fingers. However, even the staff who didn\u2019t see the aura were so into Lee Seojun and Lee Ji-seok\u2019s passionate acting that they didn\u2019t even noticed their co-staff bewildered.Everyone held their breath and swallowed their saliva.Seojun finally opened his mouth. It was his first line.\u201cTo heaven and earth, there shall be rain.\u201dWith Seojun\u2019s voice, Lee Ji-seok came to his senses and continued his acting.\u201c [email\u00a0protected] ^&amp;%&amp;@!!!!\u201dLee Ji-seok screamed as if he were really scared of becoming a demon.There was also a staff member stepping back at the loud noise.\u2018Is it futile?\u2019With a golden aura rising from Lee Seojun\u2019s body, something black seemed to shake within Lee Ji-seok\u2019s body.Choi Dae-man rubbed his eyes.On second thought, only the golden aura was moving briskly.\u201cLet the great soul leave upon this body,\u201dSeojun threw away the amulet on his left hand.Like when he practiced, the goblin\u2019s energy blew away the talisman beautifully. Fortunately, the staff in charge, who was watching the two actors in a daze, pressed tye button at the right timing.Fire!When the fire broke out in a circle, the place where Lee Seojun and Lee Ji-seok were standing was like a different world.They knew what would happen, but the staff inhaled without even realizing it.\u201cThe power to burn the dull evil!\u201dWith Seojun\u2019s voice, a golden aura rushed towards Lee Ji-seok.\u201c?!\u201dLee Ji-seok, who was genuinely surprised, screamed and rolled around the floor.A staff member who could not see the aura also swallowed his breath with Lee Ji-seok\u2019s acting.There was like a real fire.He got goosebumps.Jingle!Seojun shook the bell with both hands.It was the ringing sound from the large hanok house yard, making such a loud noise.\u201cThe power to destroy that source!\u201dThe gold flames intensified.He was worried that it would be awkward to act on fire without fire, whether it was good or bad, but Lee Ji-seok as if he was really on fire.\u201cThanks to you, I know how to handle the soul!\u201dLee Ji-seok said his lines and looked at the golden aura running around him with tired eyes.\u2018Is this really futile?\u2019\u2018Goblin Fire?\u2019Lee Ji-seok, who unexpectedly got the answer right, collapsed to the floor when the timing disappeared. Seojun collapsed too.It was the end.\u201cCut.\u201dChoi Dae-man, who had been holding his hands tightly while watching the monitor and the scene alternately, finally opened his mouth. And shouted out loud.\u201cOK!\u201dWhen Lee Seojun and Lee Ji-seok were about to talk, Assistant Director Cho clapped hands without realizing it.Clap clap clap clap!Clap clap clap clap!\u201cWow!\u201dApplause broke out among the staff.\u201cFirst of all, shall we take a break?\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never seen such a great performance before.\u201dSeojun and Lee Ji-seok roughly wiped away the dirt and settled around the monitor.\u201cLet\u2019s watched and discuss about it.\u201dDirector Choi Dae-man showed a video taken by the two actors.\u201cYou must consider the voice of evil spirits and the voice of God.\u201dAs Director Choi said, the middle of the acting was empty without lines, but just the voices and gestures of the two actors filled the screen, so it didn\u2019t feel awkward.Lee Ji-seok looked at the screen, but he couldn\u2019t find a ghost. It must have been his imagination.After the video, Lee Ji-seok said with a smile.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to retake it.\u201d\u201cI know. Both of you are so good. If I have a chance to release this video later, I really would want to.\u201d\u201cSeojun is so good at acting\u2026\u2026. Is Seojun sleeping?\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes were half closed.The adults laughed.He was still six years old.It was normal that he was tired after such a great performance.Director Choi Dae-man opened his mouth.\u201cGo to bed now.\u201d\u201cBust shoot\u2026\u2026 I have to take it\u2026\u201d\u201cYour shoot this time is okay. You can take it tomorrow. I\u2019m shooting here until the day after tomorrow anyway.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess you worked hard today. You are tired, so you need to go to bed early.\u201dWhen the actor Lee Ji-seok said that, Seojun rolled his eyes and nodded.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go to bed first. Good night.\u201d\u201cTake a good rest!\u201dKim Hee-sung, who was sitting behind Seojun, carried Seojun.Seojun, who was in Kim Hee-sang\u2019s arms, quickly fell asleep.\u201cWow, director. Look at this. My hands are shaking.\u201dLee Ji-seok, who was pretending to be relaxed in front of the child actor, leaned his back against the background and raised his hand as soon as Seojun disappeared from their sight.Choi Dae-man, who understood the condition of Lee Ji-seok from the beginning, laughed. The assistant director went to inform the staff that the filming was over.\u201cI really thought Seojun was going to burn me.\u201d\u201cI think you acted in the same level.\u201d\u201cSame level? If Seojun and I are on the same level, It would have been big deal.\u201dHe had a bright face for someone who said it was a big deal.Lee Ji-seok talked happily.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had such a fun shoot. I didn\u2019t think about anything and just acted. I become a real evil spirit, Su-hyuk. Afraid of God. And\u2026 Being on fire.\u201dWas there really nothing around him? Lee Ji-seok then held his ankle, which felt hot.\u201cMe too\u2026\u2026.\u201dDirector Choi Dae-man smoothed the corners of his mouth that he was trying to raise without even realizing it.\u201cI don\u2019t know how would it come out after editing, but I\u2019m looking forward to it and my heart is racing.\u201dAs they saw earlier, the reenactment of the golden aura might produce a better-than-expected scene.The two people, who thought they were the only ones who saw the aura, laughed.\u201cI see. The director will be the first one to see the finished version, right? I can\u2019t imagine myself in the movie. What kind of movie will it be?\u201d\u201cJi-seok, hurry up and rest. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll have a close-up shoot and bust shoot.\u201d\u201cBy the way, can we pull this off tomorrow again?\u201dEven in his opinion, he poured all his energy into the shoot.Maybe because the camera was out of sight. It was a full shot, so he was able to immerse myself more.But they are filming this again?With the camera right in front of them? Director Choi Dae-man laughed at Lee Ji-seok\u2019s concerns.\u201cIt\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t come out well. It would still be perfect if I only put the full shot in the movie. Don\u2019t worry, just relax.\u201d\u201cI may not do it comfortably, but I\u2019ll do my best.\u201dThe two laughed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m really bad at this.\u201dAlthough Seojun\u2019s aura was not like yesterday\u2019s, Lee Ji-seok, tried harder than before in order not to lose to Seojun, but he was still overwhelmed by his acting skills than in full shots.So he just lay down on the blanket as soon as he entered the room after the shot.Seojun brought the dumplings from the grandmother.Ji-seok was now limp even without covering himself with a blanket.It seemed very difficult to act possessed for a few days straight.\u201cJi-seok hyung, grandmother told me to eat dumplings.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t eat. Seojun. I\u2019m so tired. I guess I\u2019m so old.\u201d\u201cDumplings are delicious.\u201dSeojun bit a full bite of dumplings and mumbled.Lee Ji-seok, lying on the blanket, saw Seojun. Hr was dozing off at just one shot yesterday, but today they took two shots and he was still energetic.It was because yesterday Seojun pretended to be a bat, spreading goblin energy in all directions consuming more mana, but there was no way Lee Ji-seok would knew about it.Seojun ate dumplings diligently.Meat dumplings are delicious!It was a handmade dumpling made by Seojun filled with dumpling filling and the dough pie made by the grandmother.Lee Ji-seok gulped down at the sight of Seojun eating deliciously.It\u2019s hard, but the dumplings really looked delicious.\u201cGive me one, too.\u201d\u201cHere you go.

I\u2019ve heard from the villagers that the kid grew up in this village, so he knew the geography around him well. He went out early in the morning, ate here and there, and came home late at night, so his grandparents didn\u2019t have to worry about him. But the next day he fell down into the pit. It would have been a disaster if he had been found later.\u201d\u201cHe came back to consciousness yesterday. I am now in contact with his grandparents and they are saying their thanks to Seojun, he was found quickly because of you. As long as his legs get better, there\u2019s no problem.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d\u201cThe kid reported to your mom and dad that you ran by youtself. From now on, you should be right next to your uncle.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKim Hee-sung showed his cell phone screen to Seojun.<You did a good job saving the kid, but you should have gone with your uncle!><When you get back, you should write a letter of apology!><Always hold your uncle\u2019s hand!>Seojun\u2019s shoulders drooped.Kim Hee-sung scratched his forehead at the sight of Seojun\u2019s limp shoulder.When Kim Hee-sung tries to comfort Seojun.\u201cI\u2019ll get ready for the rehearsal!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun suddenly lifted his head and headed to the set with a smile.\u201cLet\u2019s worry about the letter of apology later and go to shoot the movie!\u201dKim Hee-sang said towards Seojun.With the last shooting, the film \u201cThe Devil\u201d is now finally over.***\u201cHow was your trip?\u201d\u201cGood!\u201dSeojun came back home after finishing all the shooting.Seo Eun-hye was going to take care of her mother, who was just discharged from the hospital, so Lee Min-joon was the only one at home.Everytime he came back home from work, and there was no one in the house. So he felt very lonely.Lee Min-joon hugged Seojun tightly. Seojun smiled and hugged his father back.\u201cThen I\u2019m off.\u201dKim Hee-sung waved to his friend but before he could go back home to enjoy his vacation, he was stopped by Lee Min-Joon, holding his shoulder.\u201cWhat? What it is again?\u201d\u201cWill you go to America?\u201dLee Min-joon smiled kindly, however, Kim Hee-sung got goosebumps.\u201cUnited States?!\u201dSeojun, who was taking out the gifts for his grandmother and grandfather, tilted his head while holding the goblin bag.\u2018America? Why America?\u2019\u201cUncle Hee-sung. Are you going to America?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Rather than his uncle, his father was the one who responded him.\u201cNo! I\u2019m not going! Why should I!?\u201dKim Hee-sung responded back, but Lee Min-joon dragged him into the living room.The three people sat around the table.\u201cWhy America all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cThe director said he wanted to sign a movie with Seojun, or they\u2019re coming, but it\u2019s quite a bit of a burden for them.\u201d\u2018Movie!\u2019Seojun, who was eating watermelon prepared by Lee Min-joon, raised his head.l suddenly.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be the one going with him, right?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t go because of the company.\u201d\u201cAm I doing another movie?\u201d\u201cWhat if Seojun wants to see the synopsis?\u201d\u201cWaaah!\u201dSeojun raised his hands excitedly.After filming one movie, there was another.\u2018No, wait. Isn\u2019t it an extra role again?\u2019Seojun, who wanted to do all the roles he could at this age, will decide after reading the synopsis for now.\u201cSo, why not come into our company?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s your company.\u201dKim would usually asked Lee Min-Joon about this matter because it was hard to find someone to trust and work with.Now, the company was big enough to sign a contract with a factory so he needed more people.After the dreamlike vacation, Kim Hee-sung would have many things to deal with alone.Before that, he needed a really reliable employee.For example, a person he is friend since middle school and the father of his investor, who can spend money without waste.The only person that could fit the description is Lee Min-Joon!\u201cNo, Seojun invested the money he earned from YouTube. Then Seojun could work at my company. But because of his age, you can co-represent him as his father.\u201dLee Min-joon was lost in his own thoughts at Kim Hee-sung\u2019s words.\u201cYou know I may not be always available to accompany Seojun in your stead. And do you think the company will send you in another business trip again? Besides, If you come to our company, I\u2019ll work hard to adjust your schedule! I will be also paying you a good salary! Just a little bit of work!\u201dKim Hee-sung persuaded Lee Min-joon diligently.If it didn\u2019t work, he would lie down and make a fuss till he accepted his proposal.Lee Min-joon sighed.He also talked about this to Seo Eun-hye. With her mother\u2019s hospitalization, she realized that whenever something urgent happen, the couple would need to free more time to take care of Seojun. Or get someone they could trust.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cOkay! When do you want to start work?\u201d\u201cI need to take care of my current job, so give me some time.\u201d\u201cAs much as you want!\u201d\u201cFirst of all, you go to America with Seojun.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. I trust you follow our deal after this, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. Anyway, I already contacted Seojun agant in America. Just meet with her after landing from the airplane.\u201dNara Kim.Kim Hee-sang became close to Nara while staying at Seojun\u2019s house when he was in a trip to the U.S..He nodded.\u201cMeet with the director and play with Jack afterwards. I\u2019ll should prepare a gift for him.\u201dSeojun smiled brightly. It\u2019s only been a few months since they last net, but he missed him a lot already.\u201cJack, auntie Maria and Uncle Eric! I am so excited to meet them again. Auntie Nara too!\u201dSome of the monster dolls were put down in front of Lee Min-joon.\u201cI should give them this and this!\u201d\u201cYeah, let\u2019s get that too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, only my legs were hurt and I was still alive but I would have never imagined that my legs could be so bent.At that time I was so much in pain and scared that I screamed for help, but no one came.I don\u2019t know how the time went by.\u2026. It was so cold and desolate. I cried and eventually fainted.But when I woke up, I was now in a hospital. The doctor said it would have been dangerous if I was inside the pit for a longer time. My cause of death would have been Hypothermia. However, when they measured my body temperature, they were surprised that it was normal.A child actor who was filming a movie in the village found me and saved me. He is my lifesaver. I\u2019m going to watch the movie for 10 times later.But I don\u2019t know which movie it was***In the he hospital there was a boy who went around the Internet and posted his story.Not many read it and he didn\u2019t receive any comment at all.He was about to delete it because he was embarrassed by the lack of interraction, but before he could do so he asked his grandfather, who was cutting fruits, about the movie.\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the movie, Grandpa?\u201d\u201cWhat was it? Evil, devil? Evil spirit? Something like that.\u201d\u201cDevil. Evil.\u201dThe boy searched for the word Devil in the search box. Foreign and Korean films with similar titles appeared, but they were already released.\u201cWhen is it going to be released?\u201d\u201cThey said early August. I decided to go and watch it together with the other villagers.\u201dIt is only early July.It was time for its commercials to be released, but there was still no advertisement about it on television or the Internet.[Return Hero, Redborn 2! Will released in mid-July!]\u201cOh! Redborn 2 is coming out next week!\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes sparkled.Redborn 2, a movie by Marine.* * *The YouTuber that reviews movie turned on his YouTube Live.\u201cHello, viewers. Let\u2019s start the Q&amp;A to celebrate the release of Redborn 2. I\u2019m not trying to kill time by failing to win a ticket for Redborn 2 premiere. I already have plans for today.\u201dSo what should he do today?\u201cToday, we will talk about actor Lee Seojun, who made the theater hot back in April. I will answer all the questions within the information about him that I currently know. Also, we have some helper here.\u201dSomeone waved frim the side of the screen. The YouTuber continued.\u201cShe is my sister. I thought you should know more about who is this actor Lee Seojun that everyone is talking about, so I paid a lot of money to cast her. She won\u2019t be on the screen, so please don\u2019t worry about her ugly face. I\u2019ll now read the first question!\u201d<<Internet articles and rumors say that Hollywood studios is preparing for his next movies, what will Lee Seojun\u2019s next film be from what you expect?>>\u201cAs an actor, we can\u2019t help but think about what would his next work be. Especially, if he was an extra. Lee Seojun might also be waiting for his next movie. However, unlike other actors, who would usually return within a year or two, I think it\u2019s a little early considering his young age. Unless he grow up taller in order to appear older than his age, he would probably just play role with no importance and no weight.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I think people are going crazy because at his extra role. Personally, I think Melissa Walton did a better job.\u201dThe YouTuber nodded after reading the comments.\u201cInitially, few people watch the movie several times just to cry. If it wasn\u2019t for your review video, I wouldn\u2019t have watched it 15 times. I wouldn\u2019t watch that much unless I was a person who wanted to authenticate it on the Internet or being YouTuber like yourself. What is more amazing is most of the people who did the challenge are korean.\u201d Another comment said.\u201cAs an actor Lee Seojun will definitely grow bigger even more. People will recognize his performance, so he in the end he is going to be a great actor.\u201d His sister commented.-His next movie would probably be in Hollywood? Or..Korea?\u201cThis is a pretty controversial issue, too. Aside from whether actor Lee Seojun is in the U.S. or Korea, I think it\u2019s better to appear in Hollywood movies. Even if he is an extra!\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201cThis may be a strange example, but. Let\u2019s think about baseball. There is a Korean unknown player. Somehow, he ended up playing in a major league game.\u201d-How did he do that? Lol\u201cExample, example only! The Major League game wasn\u2019t important enough to Garner many spectators. But for some reason, the attention on it was huge. In that game, where a Korean player no one knew about hit a home run that determined the victory and it was against Major League pitchers! And the team where the Korean player belongs to won. Whether it\u2019s Korea or America, this would be a viral hit. People must be curious about what kind of player he is and how would his future be! Or where the Korean player will play for next.\u201d-Our team! Our team! +1-I will definitely choose the major! There\u2019s a difference in salary!-Major +1\u201cAnd a few days later, the Korean player, appeared at the Korean stadium.\u201d-Why? Why isn\u2019t he continuing among the major?-Low chances.\u201cThat\u2019s right, so what if this really happened because of luck. What would happen for his games?\u201d-He is gonna improve and grow up?-Big potential?-He\u2019s part of the major, so he will need to pass all kinds of tests.\u201cThen let\u2019s put actor Lee Seojun on the shoes of this player What would people think if actor Lee Seojun remained in Hollywood? What would you think if he suddenly choose to be in a Korean movie?\u201d-It\u2019s a strange metaphor, but\u2026\u2026.I would think so, too.-There\u2019s a reason why One Hit Wonder exists.-Then is it better not to appear in Korean movies at all?The YouTuber and his sister fell into thought for a moment but opened his mouth.\u201cLee Seojin has to prove that he has not lost his touch with Hollywood. He had been always recognized for his acting ability and his ability to appear in Hollywood movies. At least his next film, he\u2019ll have to star in Hollywood films, and to hit the jackpo he will have to play an impressive role in the film.\u201d-But isn\u2019t it better to be paid a lot to appear in a Korean movie than to be just an extra? It would be worth it just for his name.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe Youtuber tilted his head. Where the hell did this came from?-???-??-Why? I know that Lee Seojun appeared in the Elephant commercial and the Show 48 hours. Elephant Advertising on International Regulation, right? That\u2019s why I\u2019m banned. And on the 48 hours show he didn\u2019t get paid enough, is it?\u201c\u2026\u2026You really don\u2019t know. Well, I forgot to mention it when I posted the Shadowman review. Data sponsorship.\u201dThe YouTuber turned opened a new browser tab on the screen and searched for YouTube. Then he entered the channel [JUN].\u201cHow many views, subscribers, and likes do you see here?\u201d-I can\u2019t even count.-I\u2019ve never seen this number of views before.\u201cAs long as there are babies under 20 months old with their parents on Earth, Lee Seojun will never have to worry about money.\u201d-What if YouTube went down?\u201cThey\u2019ll make it as DVD and sell it.\u201dThe youtuber shrugged.-What role do you want Lee Seojun to play?\u201cLet\u2019s see. I\u2019ve been so impressed with his performance as William so I hope I\u2019ll be able to see him again as this character next time.\u201dAfter that, the YouTuber\u2019s live continued.* * *Redborn 2 premiere day.Choi Min-ji, a PR team member from the production company of \u201cThe Devil,\u201d entered the premiere holding onto her pounding heart.It\u2019s been only a few days, but she was overwhelmed by the fact that she was watching Redborn 2 earlier than everyone else. Besides Choi Min-ji, many people who came to see the premiere realized this fact.\u201cIs it starting?\u201dChoi Min-ji, who sat in her seat, turned off her cell phone and sat down while calming down herself.She even took a vacation just to watch Redborn 2.Soon the premiere was starting.Marine\u2019s signature came out on the black screen and Redborn OST came out from speakers installed. Her heart pounded.Two hours flew by. The movie was now finished.Clap clap clap clap!Clap clap clap clap!There was now loud applauses and Choi Min-ji clapped harder.Marine\u2019s name and director Ryan Will\u2019s name were posted on the black screen.Soon, the names of the cast, the staff, and the names of their partners will appear.Choi Min-ji packed and stood up with the intention of going back quickly.The other audiences also started to get up slowly, leaving the credits behind.But the premiere\u2019s lights was still closed.\u201cWhy they didn\u2019t yet open the lights?\u201dChoi Min-ji unknowingly spoke out, but her voice was buried amidst the exclamation of the other audiences.Everyone stood up in a strange position.Boom!Choi Min-ji and people\u2019s eyes turned back to the screen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Quick!\u201dChoi Min-ji, who left the premiere hall, quickly turned on her cell phone.She was regretting to have turned off her cellphone back then.Some of the audience rubbed their arms as if they were getting goosebumps, and others looked impatient because their mouths were itching.She had been using this cell phone for 5 years. Choi Min-ji vowed that after she get a bonus and she would definitely buy another one.Bonus! Yes! There is a bonus!Ring-The cell phone is finally on.Choi Min-ji looked around and headed to the corner. She called a senior from the public relations team who she quickly got along with.Choi Min-ji cursed at her senior, because he wasn\u2019t picking it up.\u201cI\u2019m in a hurry. Why? Why? He\u2019s not picking up!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cSenior! Why are you just picking up now!\u201dA PR team member, who answered Choi Min-ji\u2019s call, took his cell phone off from his ear and looked at the screen.\u201cThe youngest, Choi Min-ji. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSenior! Are you listening?!\u201dHe tilted his head to see if she was really his good junior who was screaming like this.\u201cOh, I\u2019m listening.\u201dThe senior scratched his forehead.Choi Min-ji\u2019s voice may have leaked out of the cell phone, as the head of the PR team was pouting.\u201cWhy is she so lively? But if she is not busy, tell her to come to work.\u201d\u201cShould I?\u201dThe senior laughed at the public relations team leader\u2019s joke.\u201cDo you want to come to work after you\u2019re done with your leave?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201c\u2026. What?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming! Everyone, wait! Taxi!!!\u201dThere was a silence on the public relations team.Only Choi Min-ji\u2019s voice rang out from the cellphone shouting \u201cTaxi! Taxi!\u201dThe head of the PR team asked quietly.\u201cMinji, are you really sick?\u201d***The door to the public relations office has opened.There was Choi Min-ji. She was in a hurry forgetting that she took off a leave and that she weren\u2019t supposed to work right now.The expressions of the PR team members changed strangely.As soon as Choi Min-ji came in, she omitted her greetings and directly get to the main point.\u201cIs there anyone here who hates giving movie spoilers?\u201d\u201cThen you can\u2019t work for a film production company.\u201dWork was a spoiler. They would always hear it from the other staff and the director.ls themselves.Everyone shook their heads. The head of the PR team asked.\u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201dSince then, the expressions of the PR team members have changed after hearing Choi Min-ji\u2019s story.The head of the public relations team, who had been listening without much thought, also opened her mouth to the unexpected story.And soon after, an emergency meeting was held.***Park Sung-won visited the movie theater where Redborn 2 was released first. It was very noisy inside the movie theater.No one hid their expectations for Redborn 2. They even avoided looking for the reviews of the premiere posted on the Internet.Since Park Sung-won\u2019s first movie was shown, there was no one to give spoilers.They don\u2019t want the spoilers to kill their excitement.When time came, everyone got up from their seats and headed for the first hall. Park Sung-won followed suit.After the advertisement, Marine\u2019s signature appeared on the screen. And the OST for Redborn 2 came out.Oh!Oh!Flashing!The theater was lit up.For these two hours the audience couldn\u2019t take their eyes off.Marine!Redborn!Park Sung-won smiled and looked at the aisle as he tried to get up.The audience in the front seat went out first, causing a noisy crowded place in front of the exit.\u201cShould I wait a little before I get out?\u201dIt would be nice to sit back and listen to Redborn\u2019s OST.Park Sung-won looked around to see if there were people who thinks like him and there he saw people still sitting down.They were listening to music and watching the ending credits.The names that came out suddenly disappeared and the screen turned black. The Redborn OST also stopped.\u201cWhat is it? Was there an accident?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we call the staff?\u201dThe audience went uproar and the people ,who were going out stopped their actions.It was then.Boom!Boom boom!Park Sung-won looked up towards the screen.The screen was still black, however the music kept playing.The viewers from the first row, who were leaving the hall listened to the music and came back inside wondering what was going on. Everyone looked puzzled.Park Sung-won opened his mouth without realizing it.\u201cShadowman?\u201dPark Sung-won\u2019s voice echoed loudly in the whole hall, where only Shadowman OST was flowing.Everyone breathed in.Light were suddenly lit up.There was a teddy bear on a wooden table. And a man\u2019s shadows near the table.[William?]As if he heard the woman\u2019s voice, the shadow moved.Boom!After the Shadowman OST, the Redborn OST came out again.The ending credits of Redborn 2, which had disappeared, also began to rise slowly.The audience who were leaving the hall, the audience who were standing around to get ready to go out, and the audience who were listening to the original sound track. With their mouths open, they only saw the screen with white letters on it.\u2018What? What was that? What did I just saw\u2026\u2026?\u2019\u201cWhat?\u201dStarting with the exclamation that Park Sung-won uttered, the hall exploded to very loud noises.Park Sung-won, who returned home, turned on the computer right away.He doesn\u2019t even know how he got home.As he scrolled through the browser he saw a post on the site with Redborn spoiler.He was wondering what they were talking about before watching Redborn 2.[Review of Redborn 2 premiere]*Music*-What? *Video*-Oh, my God!\u2013 I agree.-Crazy!\u201cReally crazy!\u201dReally, it was a very factual review.[Title: (Spoiler) Redbone 2 last Video SpoilerWritten by: Marine FanWow, Redborn 2 was fun, but the shock came from the last video.I thought Shadowman 2 was gonna come out, but\u2026\u2026.wow\u2026 I was very shocked\u2026\u2026.When I heard the music, I was so happy that Shadowman 2 was coming out.Then I saw the teddy bear in the video,Wow, I\u2019ve already seen that from somewhere.And the woman\u2019s voice\u2026. She said William.I thought I heard it wrong and read the captions. And the caption really said [William?]After I hear that, I came out from the movie theater in a daze and got sunlight. I think the people who watched the movie with me all came to their senses. I could hear many people gasping for air.Seriously. Marine\u2026\u2026.Take all my money!! Oh, my God. Such a very shocking trailer!]-Can somebody tell me what had happened from William and Shadowman\u2019s comic? I can\u2019t predict the development!!-It\u2019s shocking. I thought it was just an extra character.-Hero or Villain!-Too young to be a villain.-Isn\u2019t William too young to be a hero, either?-Shadowman comic was realeased 20 years ago. It wasn\u2019t popular back then, so it is now out of print. I think it\u2019s somewhere in the Marine comic Museum.Park Sung-won, who was reading the post, also replied.-Lee Seojun, will he be in the Marine series for this time as well?\u2013 Will they change the actor in Shadowman 2?-I am very curious, he was just an extra in Shadowman 1, but I think they would be casting a new actor because it is a very important role.\u201cReally?\u201dPark Sung-won scratched his head.-Then they should have used an American actor from the beginning. Isn\u2019t that racism?\u2013 They are not racist, the Director makes a lot of anti-racism movies.-Just looking at the shadows, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be Lee Seojun.-But if Lee Seojun plays William, wouldn\u2019t the be amazing?-I think they\u2019re going to make Shadowman into a series, so William will then become a very essential role.-Marine\u2019s film will not only be released in the U.S., it will released all over the world, and just one name on the cast will be going to be huge. A guaranteed box office success, a guaranteed fame. I don\u2019t think there is a Korean actor who has succeeded in Hollywood this much.-But we are not sure if he will come out.Right now, the public opinion has gone in a negative direction.There are more and more posts from people who have watched the trailer video from Redborn 2.In the U.S., Redborn 2\u2019s trailer video was also a hot topic.-It\u2019s Seojun.-No. They need to recruit a new actor. This is also good for him, he would still Garner attention.And a week after Redborn 2 was released, it was posted on Marine\u2019s website and SNS.[Marin\u2019s hero is everyone\u2019s hero and there is no one to be excluded from \u2018everyone\u2019.]-Of course!-Everyone\u2019s hero!

I heard it from him and the plot was great.\u201dA few months ago, while Palin was on a business trip, a meeting was held.Ryan Will proposed Shadowman to become a series. This wasn\u2019t the problem, what gave them a big problem is the plot proposed by him.William will become Shadowman\u2019s biggest villain.They didn\u2019t think that the role, initially thought of as an extra, will also be the one that would appear throughout the Shadowman series.Aside from the characters\u2019 ages, this was also a story with main characters as Asian and Westerner.Ryan Will, who attended the meeting, looked into Richard Bowin\u2019s eyes as he sat with his arms folded.The people in the meeting room, who had been arguing, also went silent at the sight of director Ryan Will, who looked at them without any comment.There was no other sound inside the conference room.What a terrible sight.Richard Bowin face palmed himself recalling what had happened inside the conference.\u201cIt will definitely stain our reputation if you don\u2019t listen to me, you\u2019d literally make a movie about Marine\u2019s racism.\u201d\u201cHahaha.

The actor\u2019s name popped up at the bottom of the screen.Lee Ji-seok.\u201cOh, Lee Ji-seok. If Lee Ji-seok plays the lead role, it\u2019s going to be a big hit\u2026.\u201dThe fleeing man arrived in a village.Crows crowed and a big wooden gate opened.Thud!It\u2019s closed. And suddenly the screen turned black.The tense music stopped at the same time.Park Sung-won felt a subtle sense of deja vu on the suddenly turned offscreen.Jingle!\u201cHuh?\u201dThey heard a bell.Park Sung-won sat slowly in front of the television screen without taking his eyes off from it.Jingle!On the television, a shaman was performing an exorcism.Park Sung-won didn\u2019t even know his mouth was now open wide.Jingle!Then a human shadow appeared on the table.[Child.]The shadow moved.The screen changed and a burning letter appeared.[The devil, big release in early August!]Now, Park Sung-won was staring blankly at the television screen until several commercials came next and his favorite program started.Title: (Redborn 2 Spoiler) Is that true?Written by: Marine fanShould I give a spoiler for Redborn 2?If you haven\u2019t seen the trailer of \u201cThe Devil,\u201d please watch it on YouTube.First of all, there are two possibilitiesThe devil plagiarized.Marine Corporation approved it.If it\u2019s plagiarism, the devil spirit production company will be in trouble.

I\u2019ll go watch the devil make sure it\u2019s really Lee Seojun.It\u2019s been two days since the trailer of the evil spirit was released. South Korea is once again on fire as \u2018Lee Seojun\u2019 trended.[What is the next movie of Korean Hollywood child actor Lee Seojun?][What kind of movie will Lee Seojun appear next?][What kind of actor is Lee Seojun in Hollywood?][Lee Seojun is in Korea right now? Or in America?]\u2013 I think we can call him a real Hollywood star.-Oh, my God. Isn\u2019t Lee Seojun 6 years old now?\u2013 5 years and 5 months old in American age.A YouTuber uploaded a video. He shrugged and laughed as if he was crazy.\u201cLee Seojun did a perfect job. I didn\u2019t even imagine it. Hollywood movie, and Marine\u2019s movie series! And now he is shooting a Korean movie. I\u2019m really looking forward to what kind of actor he was going to be.\u201d-You\u2019re wrong about him acting after a few years.-Seojun: America? Korea? I can do both.Then in early August, the devil was released.Again, Park Sung-won, who did not miss the first screening on the first day, entered the movie theater.\u201cIt\u2019s probably Lee Seojun, right?\u201d\u201c100 percent Lee Seojun.\u201dListening to people\u2019s chatter and looking at the devil\u2019s pamphlet, there was no picture or name of Lee Seojun.There were only pictures of tables, bells, and shadows in the preview.\u201cIf you want to watch the Devil, please enter the 9th hall!\u201dPark Sung-won sat down in accordance with the guidance of the employees.Soon, the fire went out and a fiery letter appeared on the screen.The Devil.One day, Su-hyuk, who works at an antique shop, gets a jewelry box that looks expensive.He was going to clean it up and sell it, but it was a mistake..The evil spirit from the jewelry box clung to Su-hyuk.The evil spirit caused all kinds of trouble on Su-hyuk\u2019s body.It was a minor accident at first, but soon the antique shop was set on fire.Su-hyuk traveled from churches to cathedrals, temples, and other places to fight off evil spirits, but all those who helped him were put in danger.The pastor, who was being carried by ambulance, gave a piece of paper to Su-hyuk.Su-hyuk set off with the determination to end his life if he couldn\u2019t find a solution.Following the address from the piece of paper, Su-hyuk arrived in the village.There he saw a little boy in hanbok.A child with an indifferent expression looked at him with a creepy look and closed the door.Not long after, his grandfather led him inside a room.The next day, the grandfather wanted to take a walk with Su-hyuk. During their walk, he brought up a story about the little boy.The seven-year-old boy lost his parents to a devil when he was four. At the same day, a God possessed his body.From then on he had lived these past three years without crying, laughing, or speaking. The grandfather still took care of the child\u2019s life even though he isn\u2019t his family biologically.Su-hyuk saw a little boy standing in front of the West Part of the village, staring blankly at the tree.The little shaman was the same age as the nephew of Su-hyuk. Unlike his troublesome nephew, the little shaman was like a living puppet without any emotions.\u201cThe evil spirit covets the child\u2019s body.\u201dSu-hyuk\u2019s face hardened at the grandfather\u2019s words.He tried to get out of town.That little boy is too young to be sacrificed for him.A fight broke out between the evil spirit and him because the evil spirit wanted to stay in the village while Su-hyuk wanted to escape the village.In the end, Su-hyuk lost.Late at night, the evil spirits stormed into the little boy\u2019s house. The little kid seemed to be waiting for it. Su-hyuk tried to fight the evil spirit residing inside him.The night was full of screams.Su-hyuk opened his eyes wide.The grandfather was nursing him next to his side and laughed.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me and meet him?\u201d\u201cYou mean to meet him?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dSomehow, he walked along with the grandfather toward the yard.It\u2019s already been a week since Su-hyuk collapsed.The grandfather took care of him because he was hurt not by her body but by his soul, he was sure that he would not be able to treat in a normal hospital.\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to him.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe grandfather smiled and opened the big wooden gate. There\u2026\u201cHi, Su-hyuk\u201d.A kid wearing a yellow kindergarten uniform and carrying a backpack stood smiling brightly.Su-hyuk looked at the little boy and grandfather with a puzzled face.\u201cWe\u2019ve eradicated the evil spirit, and the inner god has used up all his strength. God is not bad, but he put a lot of pressure on the child. Now this child will live a normal life, laughing and crying like any other child. He was now able to attend kindergarten. It\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 You shouldn\u2019t take me.\u201dWhen he saw the little boy holding his hand with a bright smile.The scene of a little shaman who cried all night in order to fight off evil spirits was now nowhere to be seen.Su-hyuk kneeled down and made eye contact with the little boy.\u201cLittle boy, what\u2019s your name?\u201dThe child smiled brightly at Su-hyuk\u2019s question.* * *Title: Just a feeling. I am really excited.Written by: Evil spirit.Honestly, at first, I was wondering if it was really Lee Seojun, but I think I\u2019ll watch the movie a few more times.His acting as William was so impressive that I never imagined Lee Seojun acting in other roles, but I feel like a fool.Lee Ji-seok\u2019s acting was amazing, but Lee Seojun\u2019s acting as a shaman was more amazing.If Lee Ji-seok\u2019s acting is like a double character + alpha, then Lee Seojun\u2019s acting feels like there\u2019s something inside.When Lee Seojun looked up and down Su-hyeok, I got goosebumps thinking he seeing through me.And after Lee Seojun came out, Lee Ji-seok and the movie became crazy.Lee Seojun seemed to have a god with a lot of power.Lee Ji-seok seemed to be possessed by a real evil spirit and fought with evil spirits. The direction and the CG matched is comparable with the foreign movies, it looked very real.I had so much fun. I didn\u2019t expect it at all.The mood of the movie has changed since Lee Seojun came out.Before Lee Seojun came out, it\u2019s like they were still in the human world but after he appeared it feels like it was now in the realm of the gods. That\u2019s what it feels like.CG was the best when they fought. I want to make it into a gif later.And the staff automatically revealed the secrets after the movie was released. They posted on SNS and the Internet in unison.Photos taken with Seojun in casual clothes and Seojun\u2019s autographed paper were all posted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeojun returned to Korea with his uncle Hee-sung. Seojun\u2019s bag was full of gifts from his acquaintances, there was also the script from director Ryan Will.Shadowman 2.Seojun had read the script and heard more details about the development process from the director, Ryan Will, himself.Somehow, the vice president of Marine Production house looked at him with complex eyes, but he shrugged and quickly signed the contract.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeojun recalled the contents of the script. There was only one problem he could think of. Acting in front of director Ryan Will made him a little bit uncomfortable.Unlike the acting he had done so far, he felt kind of nervous.And even when they came back to Korea, he wondered what the problem was, but he had no clues.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be a big deal because the director said I could act as William\u2026. As expected, I don\u2019t know why I am feeling this.\u201dAfter unpacking his things in his bedroom, Seojun put the script of Shadowman 2 next to a bookshelf full of English Script given by his aunt Nara.This bookshelf would be where Seojun will put the script where he would appear in the future. For now, it only contains three scripts.This would be called \u2018The bookshelf of life!\u2019In the future, he will fill this same bookshelf with scripts from movies where he acted.\u201cSeojun, let\u2019s eat grapes.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dRecently his father just resigned from his previous work and started to work on his uncle Hee-sang\u2019s company and his mother started tutoring Korean students. They are now watching television together.On the TV, Lee Ji-seok was being interviewed in order to promote the movie \u2018The devil.\u2019\u201cIs Seojun not going to do that?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he too young to be interviewed?\u201d\u201cI can do it!\u201dSeojun can do it if his parents let him, but somehow, after the preview of Shadowman 2 was released, all the scheduled promotions, role and advertisement proposal suddenly backed off.Unlike Lee Min-joon and his wife\u2019s worries at the sudden event, Seo Eun-chan felt that this was just normal.\u201cIt\u2019s about the money. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re thinking about how much they should pay to an actor who would be going to shoot Shadowman. Also, the title of \u2018Hollywood actor\u2019 already made him popular. I can\u2019t predict how much promotional effect Seojun would have if he really promotes this.\u201dFortunately, there was an increase in roles and advertisements proposal after \u2018The Devil\u2019 started to be more popular. Many companies concluded that the appearance fee would be expensive, but it would be worth it.\u201cWhat, do you like to appear in an advertisement?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201dSeojun shook his head at his dad\u2019s question.Although the appearance fee would be very high and his acting skills would be recognized, the roles he was receiving were just common.A child who lost his parents, a crying child and a child just standing while smiling. The role that he can play at this age was just the same. Surely, the role of the child shaman was very unique.[What kind of actor is Lee Seojun?]The whole family\u2019s eyes turned towards the television when the interviewer asked the question to Lee Ji-Seok.Seojun first film as an important in a movie was a box office hit, and he would also be acting in another Marine movie known for being worldwide blockbusters. He is now, currently, the main topic of everyone in korean.[Lee Seojun is amazing! At first, I thought he was just a genius actor with natural talent at first, but he feels like he possessed many experiences.]The people watching TV nodded at his words.A Hollywood movie at age of 6. It wasn\u2019t officially announced by Marine, but with that hint, everyone could guess what they mean. Lee Seojun will now be, not just a side character but a main character.If he isn\u2019t a genius, so what he should be called?[There was a time where I saw him practicing his lines.][What was he like?][He studied not only his own lines but all of them. Also, because of his age, there were still many words he could not understand so he would asked me what it means and how it was read\u2026.]Lee Ji-seok laughed. It was because he remembered a script that popped out from a bag that looked like a goblin. Seojun took out his script to asked him some things he could not understand.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon, who were watching Lee\u2019s interview, also laughed.Seojun pouted his lips.\u2018What? It\u2019s my first time learning Korean! No\u2026it may not be the first life where I learnt Korean, but I don\u2019t remember it anymore.\u2019[When he showed me his script, it was full of colorful highlights!][That\u2019s cute][Yes. He is indeed very cute.]The interviewer, Lee Ji-seok, and people watching the interview smiled.[Lee Seojun is an actor possessing great talent and even work hard. When I acted together with him, I was drawn towards his aura. When Su-hyuk and the child shaman first met, I felt like I really became Su-hyuk. I was overwhelmed by the god that actor Lee Seojun expressed.]Some of the people who watched \u2018The Devil\u2019 nodded at the behind-the-scenes story. After the interview, the light on the screen suddenly dimmed and the interviewer asked quietly.[Some of the staff said they saw a ghost during the time of the shoot. Did you also see it, Ji-seok?]Ghost? The couple tilted their heads. If such a thing had come out, Kim Hee-sung, an occult enthusiast, would have not missed it.\u201cSeojun, have you seen a ghost?\u201d\u201cNo?\u201dSeojun rolled his eyes. He could guessed what had happened.That\u2019s it. The Energy trom the goblin.It must have looked golden because it was made of brass and yellow energy.He was surprised to see the CG after the post-production. The scene that he saw with his own eyes came out on the screen exactly as it was.He thought it would affect people to some extent, but he never imagined that there would be also some people who could see it.\u201cI didn\u2019t see it.\u201dSeojun pretended not to know.[Isn\u2019t there a scene where the CG effects were extremely good?][Yes, there were a lot of reviews saying that it really felt like God had really come to the shaman\u2019s body and that the Korean CG has developed this much. There was also a rumor that the number of people asking for \u2018The Devil\u2019 CG team has increased, right?]The Interviewer tilted his head. What did he mean by bringing the CG topic when they were talking about ghost?Lee Ji-seok laughed because he could see through the Interviewer face.[Do you remember the golden flame we saw on CG? Wrapped around actor Lee Seojun\u2019s body, ran around me like a wolf, and suck me in like a fire?][Of course, it\u2019s one of the best scenes in \u2018The devil\u2019, and there\u2019s no way I could ever forget that.][That was the ghost][\u2026What?]Lee Min-Joon, who was eating grapes, spat out grapes as his mouth formed an \u2018O\u2019 shape because he went speechless.Lee Min-joon liked how the CG was edit out in that part saying it was cool, but he was extremely afraid of ghost so he went pale recalling the scene now.Not only Lee Min-joon but also those who were watching the interview were speechless like the Interviewer.Lee Ji-seok laughed at the dumbfounded face of the interviewer.[I thought I was the only one who saw it, but Director Choi saw the ghost, too! So he thought it would be good to use that scene as it is and worked hard with the CG staff to make it as natural as possible. The CG staff also thought they did an amazing stuff and on how it had such a clear image. They didn\u2019t even think it was a real ghost.]A CG staff, who was watching television with his family, has his mouth opened wide.[I was surprised to see the movie after the editing and CG work at the premiere. Just like what I saw during the shooting, it felt real. Because of that, the director and the other staff thought they saw the \u2018same\u2019 ghost.]Is it just an ear problem or not? It seems like Lee Ji-Seok gave emphasis at the word same.Having watched the movie and now hearing the creepy story from Lee Ji-Seok, the interviewer could barely continue the interview.[Then\u2026 Everything was in CG?][The Full shot only, I only saw it when we took the full shot, but I didn\u2019t see it after that. It was a bit disappointing. My acting would\u2019ve been more realistic if I saw after that. But since the movie is successful, I don\u2019t think I would need to lie that I have seen ghosts on the set, do I? Hahaha]Lee Ji-seok, who burted out a joke, laughed.Comments piled up on the interview program bulletin board about the interesting behind-the-scenes story of \u2018The Devil\u2019.-Won\u2019t you be cursed if you reenact something like that? The director and the actors seemed to be insane.-My friend was a staff member of The Devil team. Everyone was just watching, and some of them reallly saw the ghosts.-I knew it..-Lee Seojun\u2019s acting. At first, I thought I saw a ghost, but when he fought with the evil spirits, I thought he was a great god. but I can\u2019t believe it was all real.Lee Ji-seok smiling in the dark light. The Interviewr, who was growing scared at his stories, quickly changed the subject.[Did Lee Seojun help someone on set?]A post appeared on the television screen at the Interviewer\u2019s words.Seojun and his wife, who were watching the interview without much thought, were surprised to see the post on the screen.Title: Wow. I actually meat Lee Seojun, but I didn\u2019t recognized him.Written by: Law-abiding order[Link to the previous article]Please read this before you come at me. The movie filmed in our village was \u201cThe Devil\u201d and the child actor who saved me was \u201cLee Seojun.\u201d I didn\u2019t recognize him because I fainted\u2026\u2026 Really\u2026\u2026 I was going to buy him something delicious because he saved me, but he had more money than I did.[An attachment of a picture of the cast on his legs.] I could only hear his voice and did not see his face.I fell into a boar pit hole\u2026I would have been in big trouble if actor Lee Seojun didn\u2019t save me! Actor Lee Seojun. That was very thoughtful of you!\u201cThat\u2019s the little child that Seojun saved.\u201d\u201cI guess he is okay now!\u201dA month later, \u2018The Devil\u2019, which trended yet again at the words \u2018It was a ghost\u2019 continued to be a hit and ended with a total of 6 million viewers.Then a few months later, the film was released in several countries, including the United States.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s hang out later!\u201dSeojun waved to his kindergarten friends. Most of them headed home by the kindergarten bus, while some of them were picked up by their mothers.His friends who held their mother\u2019s hand left the kindergarten while talking to their mothers about what they did today.Now, the parents could greet Seojun with great confidence, as if they had gotten used to the scene at the kindergarten where the Hollywood actor was attending.Considering the first time Seojun came to kindergarten, they adapted well.Seojun shook his head when he remembered that time. It was a difficult time.The children didn\u2019t know who he was, but their parents were so excited at the fact he was studying here that they would constantly ask for a picture or an autograph.In the end, everyone calmed down when the kindergarten director, who predicted the situation, decided to facilitate the situation.\u201cSeojun, it\u2019s cold, right? Shall we go in and wait?\u201dSeojun took the teacher\u2019s hand and went back inside.Seo Eun-hye, who picks up Seojun at the exact time every day, came late today. The reason was that she sent off her parents for a trip.The departure time of the flight to Europe happened right at the time Seojun\u2019s school finished, so he had to be left at a kindergarten for more time.Seojun made amulets using the ability he found in the newly opened library. It took three days because he could only make one a day.No other abilities were used while making the amulets. He was worried that the effect would be reduced if he didn\u2019t used his maximum capability.Seojun handed the amulet to the people who came to their house this morning.

Her best friend sent her a picture. She was a friend who came to her house once a week to help her clean up, hoping she would feel better.-Isn\u2019t he cute? You like cute things, right? [Picture]There was a picture of a kid. Emma couldn\u2019t take her eyes off from his smiling face in a cape with wings.[Angel\u2019s charming wings is activated]At that moment, Emma\u2019s mind felt refreshed.

She used to feel lazy and just watch the trash lay on the floor, but now she wanted to clean it up quickly.Emma stood up from the sofa with a smile for the first time in a long time.Now, it\u2019s time to start over.Lee Seojun\u2019s photo spread all over the world very quickly. And among them, there was Ryan Will.\u201cThis is Jun, right?\u201dJonathan showed Ryan the picture he received from a friend.Ryan had just come back from a movie theater in the U.S.Unexpectedly, Jonathan handed Ryan his phone, looking serious. Ryan looked at his phone silently, frowned, and read the comments.(TL: Remember Jonathan Will?

I brought it!\u201d\u201cBy the way, what are we going to do?\u201d\u201cTo meet Seojun Lee.\u201d* * *Ryan Will trip to Korea was hidden to the public. Unless Marine published articles, there was no one who would spend time to memorize the names or faces of film directors.The two unpacked in the hotel and contacted Lee Min-Joon and his wife. They heard that they were coming to Korea, but they were surprised to know that they would come so soon, so they gave them their home address immediately.Seojun shook hands with Ryan Will. Behind Ryan, Jonathan was waving awkwardly.Ryan Will, who had a short conversation, brought up the point.\u201cI need to talk to Jun for a moment.\u201d\u201cOh, well, would you like us to leave you alone?\u201dLee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye tried to leave. Ryan Will shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dStill, it seemed to be an important topic, so the three sat a little away from Ryan Will and Seojun.Ryan Will sat in front of Seojun. Seojun couldn\u2019t guess why Ryan came, so he couldn\u2019t look at him straight.Ryan opened his mouth.\u201cI watched The Devil, Jun.\u201d\u201cThe Korean movie?\u201d\u201cAlthough there were few screenings, I could watch them at the Cinema.\u201d\u2018It was released in the U.S. too!\u2019Director Ryan nodded at Seojun\u2019s happy face.\u201cI don\u2019t know much about shamans, but your acting was good.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dSeojun said nervously. It was because Ryan Will\u2019s expression was stiff and he still didn\u2019t know what Ryan wanted with him.Seojun swallowed his saliva. Well, he didn\u2019t come all the way to Korea to compliment him.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDo you remember when you auditioned?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeojun nodded. When he went to the U.S with his uncle Hee-sung, Ryan Will, said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what race an actor is, but an actor who can\u2019t act will never be accepted.\u201dWith that said, he gave Seojun a short script and let him do an audition. Seojun passed as expected and he even signed the contract.\u201cI thought the exotic atmosphere I felt in your performance was the aura of a villain\u2026\u201dSeojun looked into director Ryan Will\u2019s eyes.When he heard that William was a villain before the audition Seojun searched in the library an ability befitting of a villain.However, neither the first door nor the second door would let him give the ability of such character. It was clear that he needed would be in the third door that he just opened this time.In the end, Seojun used \u201cBubbly Goblin\u2019s Teasing Mr.Kim\u201d in his audition.Even if it was somewhat \u201cevil\u201d to Seojun, it was like a joke. A witty joke that makes even the victim laugh.So during the audition, Seojun acted with the spirit of a goblin in his body, which produced the most villain-like aura. Seojun thought that was enough.\u201cBut when I watched the Devil, it wasn\u2019t.\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes shook. As he expected it. He felt uncomfortable since the audition was over.Ryan Will was here to point that out now.In a serious atmosphere, both the couple and Jonathan quietly listened to their conversations. The couple thought. It was a little early.No, it was too early for a child who was almost seven years old.But the couple was confident with Seojun\u2019s talent, ability, and effort. They thought he was different from ordinary children. This ordeal was their son needed to overcome. And they believe they could.During the audition, Jonathan, who had watched \u2018The Devil\u2019, bit his lips. Jonathan didn\u2019t realize the mistake that his uncle pointed out and Seojun was still you. He has plenty of time to learn, analyze and study harder in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t know if you had just one scene in that villain act. But \u2018William\u2019 doesn\u2019t have just one scene. He will come out from time to time throughout the movie, and since it\u2019s a series, there might be more than just a few movies. Then people will realize. The fact that William you play isn\u2019t just a villain.\u201dRyan Will recalled The Devil he watched in the cinema. Seojun\u2019s aura felt beyond the golden CG.\u201cThe energy I felt when I watching the Devil was becoming warmer and greater. It was disparate because I had never experienced it, but it was definitely good.\u201dSeojun had nothing to say. It was as Ryan Will said. No matter how hard he tried to wrap it up, [Bubbly goblin\u2019s teasing Mr.Kim] was still a virtuous skill.\u201cNow people who have watched The Devil will feel the same way when they see \u2018William\u2019 you play. He\u2019s a villain, but he\u2019s nice. And they will surely find that strange. And\u2026That\u2019s not the \u2018William\u2019 I want.\u201dRyan Will sighed unconsciously. If that was the case, those who did not watch the Devil might have felt that Seojun\u2019s \u201cWilliam\u201d performance was a villain.In \u201cShadowman 2,\u201d which was about to be filmed, if he experienced many roles as he grew older, had more diverse experiences and diversified acting range, Seojun would definitely have been able to play the perfect villain on the \u201cShadowman\u201d series.At least that was Ryan Will\u2019s plan.The reason why he thought of a young child who has little acting experience as \u201cWilliam\u201d was because of his plan to lower the standard for William\u2019s performance in Shadowman 2.\u201cBut the Picture where you appeared recently caused the problem.\u201d\u201cA Picture?\u201dEveryone listened to Ryan Will\u2019s words out of the blue.\u201cHis Picture in angel clothes. His picture has spread all over the world.\u201dSeojun tilted his head. \u2018That\u2019s the problem? Isn\u2019t it better if my face is known?\u2019\u201cUnlike a villain-like movie, where you appear for two hours, your image is stuck in the head in just a second. And that scalability is nothing compared to movies. Even when there is no movie theater, even countries where The Devil are not translated, cell phones, computers and Etc\u2026 it will spread everywhere. In addition, they can see the picture again and again at any time.\u201dLooking at the picture Jonathan showed him, Ryan Will identified the problem at a glance.\u201cYou\u2019re too good.\u201dRyan Will\u2019s expression was too serious to be a compliment, so everyone looked away.\u201cThat\u2019s how the image got stuck. Unless it\u2019s a pretty overwhelming performance, everyone can\u2019t get away from the image you portrayed in the picture while watching your performance.\u201dAt that moment, everyone remembered the story of a woman who saw Seojun\u2019s picture and said she felt like she gained a new life.\u2018Oh, I see.\u2019At first no one took it seriously, but only director Ryan Will, who has been watching Seojun\u2019s performance, realized the seriousness of this case.\u201cUsually the characters of the previous work do not affect the next one for no reason. And this image will become like a form of advertisement. But once people recall your Angel image, they will remember your Angel features than the villain one in Shadowman 2.\u201d\u201c\u2026Can\u2019t I be in the movie then?\u201dRyan Will frowned at Seojun\u2019s question.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just say you\u2019re going to study how a villain acts? You\u2019re a genius. You can do anything if you really learned. An Angel-like image? Press it down with your overwhelming acting skills!\u201dThe [Elf\u2019s Basic Breathing] is the source of Seojun in high emotional happenings.Even if he acted without using his abilities, Seojun\u2019s source, which was already full of Mana of the Sun, would exude that \u201cgoodness\u201d everytime he played the villain. (TL: Mana of the Sun, Light Element Mana. The Raws literally said Mana of the Sun so I adapted it in the translations.)Now, even if he stops [Elf\u2019s Basic Breathing], Seojun\u2019s tendency to portray as good has already been fixed within his personality.\u201c\u2026What if I can\u2019t study?\u201dIt was obvious that it wouldn\u2019t work. So Seojun couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cThen you\u2019ll only play a similar role for the rest of your life.\u201dRyan Will was very frank towards a 6-year-old child.\u201cWell.\u201dSeojun didn\u2019t like it. Superstars had to be able to play any role perfectly. If he can\u2019t play the role of a teenager in his 30s because of his appearance. Seojun wanted to play any role perfectly.Ryan Will continued as he noticed Seojun troubled face.\u201cLet\u2019s practice.\u201d\u201cPractice?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll help you until I can. I wanted to take care of your William from the moment I saw you. If you only going to give up here, I wouldn\u2019t have even thought about creating a Shadowman into a series.\u201dJonathan, who heard Ryan Will\u2019s persistence, nodded.\u2018Still, my father used to get sick and tired of talking. But he is crazy about movies!\u2019 (Note: It seems like Jonathan used Appa here to depict Ryan Will so he may be his adopted father with his real father as Ryan\u2019s brother or cousin.)\u201cWell.\u201d\u2018Thank you, but I will not allow.\u2019Ryan Will asked Seojun, who showed a hesitant face.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to do it? Are you going to give up this much?\u201d\u2018Giving up\u2019The word struck Seojun\u2019s chest like an arrow. Despite living many lives, Seojun has never given up his life. He lived, even though he would die only three days after he was born. He would still lived his life to the fullest at his short life.\u201cI\u2019m going to\u2026\u2026. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dRyan Will, with a satisfied smile, pulled the paper out of his bag. It was a script written in English.\u201cIt\u2019s a one-man play. I wrote it as a villain in your age. Let\u2019s do it step by step first.\u201dSeojun took the script.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I think you\u2019ll make it in less than a few months.\u201dSeojun nodded.In Seojun\u2019s room, Ryan Will and Seojun\u2019s practice began. From there only the voices of the two people sharing their thoughts could be heard.Lee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye were at a loss outside the door, while Jonathan studied by writing down Ryan Will\u2019s sharp tips on paper.* * *Seojun opened his eyes in the library. He plopped down in front of it and heave a sigh.He acted in front of Ryan Will all the time, but the effect of [Elf\u2019s Basic Breathing] was too great. It didn\u2019t look \u201cevil\u201d.He looked up at the two wide open doors. All the library available to his age has already been searched through.\u201cI don\u2019t I can do this.\u201dSeojun was very discouraged.Seojun took out the book of his first life. The book was so old and about to crumble, but he could still read the letters.It was such a very bad life that it was too frustrating to read it again. Nevertheless, he did not give up.Seojun was lost in thought.There was also a way to play only the good part. Still, he could have become a superstar. But that was juts giving up. He was avoiding that decision. Seojun closed the book.\u201cI don\u2019t want to give up either.\u201d\u2018But what do I do?\u2019 Seojun looked at his first life\u2019s book and towards the library. he turned his head without realizing it.On the other side of the library door, there was darkness.Ryan Will and Jonathan returned to the United States a week after. Even then, Ryan Will\u2019s one-man drama was still on-going.Ryan Will and Seojun decided to talk on video call once a week while watching the video that seemed to be the best.In the meantime, grandfather and grandmother, who went on a trip to Europe, has returned safely.Seojun came to meet them in the airport, his grandparents each held out a piece of torn firefly talisman paper.\u201cWhat do I do about this? The amulet Seojun gave me was torn apart.\u201d\u201cGrandpa\u2019s, too. Will you draw it again later?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dDelicately painted fireflies were torn from place to place. There\u2019s no way a grandparent would tear up a gift from their grandchildren.\u2018Oh, it\u2019s\u2026\u2019Seojun was surprised and circled around his grandmother and grandfather to see if they were hurt. Adults thought it was because he was happy to see them so they laughed.His grandparents came to Seojun\u2019s house while happily talking about their trip in Europe and also talked about the traffic accident that happened on their trip.When his grandmother realized that she had left her stuff at the accommodation, she went back to the accommodation with the guide.Because of that, the package tour bus left about 10 minutes late.\u201cI don\u2019t know how shocked I was when a teenager cursed at me.\u201d\u201cHow much did they blame your grandmother for being late? But when we saw the accident, the driver and the guide said, \u2018If we had left on time, we would have been there\u2019, and everyone kept their mouths shut!\u201dFortunately, there were no fatalities, but it could have been a major accident if their bus was involved in the crash. The couple and Seojun breathed a sigh of relief.After New Year, Seojun received a lot of birthday gift and became one-year-old older.He is now 6 years old now, 7 years old in Korean age!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before this happened he would grabbed a thin straw and knocked on the door of the library every night.He was waiting for when it would open, but now it finally opened.Seojun opened the newly opened library with his eyes sparkling.\u201cSeojun is feeling down today.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been like that since morning.\u201dSeo Eun-chan stopped by Seo Eun-hye\u2019s house and the first thing he noticed is how Seojun was today.Seo Eun-chan has been busy acquiring stocks and organizing Cocoa Entertainment on behalf of the president, who has been arrested for crimes such as embezzlement of funds.He came to inform Seojun, his older sister, and brother-in-law, who contributed funds for the acquisition of Cocoa Entertainment, about the important announcement.Seojun was lying on the sofa in the living room like slime that had been worn out after playing for a long time.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Nothing.\u201d\u201cNothing? What?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing really\u2026\u201dSeo Eun-chan rolled his eyes at Seojun\u2019s adult like words and gaze at Lee Min-joon. Lee Min-joon smiled bitterly at him and pointed his finger toward the kitchen to discuss Seojun\u2019s problem.\u201cDirector Ryan came in korea back at the end of December.\u201dLee Min-joon slowly told the whole story.Seo Eun-chan watched the five-year-old boy laying on the sofa with tired eyes. It seems that he was tired from filming his recent practice of the One-Man drama that Ryan Will gave him.\u201cIt\u2019s July now.\u201dThe weather is slowly becoming hotter, and the typhoon will be coming soon in early July.For the past seven months, Seojun has been practicing his One-Man drama every single day.From morning till night. Whether at home or in kindergarten, he practiced continuously not wasting a second.However, after realizing that he had been spending too much on his acting and neglected his daily life, Seojun now went to kindergarten and practiced acting only at a fixed time.Many video calls with Ryan Will, but all of those failed.\u201cArgh!\u201dSeojun was flapping on the sofa screaming.\u2018It wasn\u2019t even in the new library! I read all the books, but there was none\u2026\u2019He used the ability that seems to be \u2018Villain\u2019, but he failed once again. Ryan even told that he became nicer.\u2018From the day Ryan came, I didn\u2019t even do [Elf\u2019s Basic Breathing]!\u2019He got used to using [Elf\u2019s Basic Breathing] so he was trying hard not to do it unconsciously.\u2018Oh no, I just did it!\u2019Seojun stopped [Elf\u2019s Basic Breathing], which he just did unconsciously.When Seojun, who was flapping, fell on the sofa tired, Seo Eun-chan smiled at the sight of him. This was a new side of Seojun, who seemed to be always calm.\u201cSo these past few days, I saw a lot of things that I didn\u2019t know about Seojun.\u201dSeo Eun-hye scolded Seojun for constantly staying in his room.He goes to the kindergarten without washing up and even take the script out even at school hours.Lee Min-Joon scolded his son for thinking about something else while eating snacks.Recalling the attitude of Seojun during these past few months, Lee Min-joon also smile.Seojun was getting tired.It\u2019s already been seven months. He was confident if it would be a year or 5 years later. No, Seojun shook his head.Seojun, who was lying on the sofa and look at the sky outside the window and sighed.At first, he thought he could do it if he didn\u2019t use my powers, but it wasn\u2019t on par with Ryan Will\u2019s assessment. Still, he said he looked nice.So he waited for the next library door to open, but there were still no Villain like ability he could use.\u201cSigh.\u201dSeojun breathed a heavy sigh as if he had all kinds of problems in the world again.\u2018But wouldn\u2019t it be better if I practice a little more?\u2019 Seojun jumped out of the sofa and headed back to his room.\u2018Practice. Practice is the only way to live.\u2019***Ryan Will came back to Korea. Jonathan was with him again. The couple and Seojun were very nervous about the sudden appearance of the director. They had a hunch that a big one would pop up today.Today, Seojun needed to act in front of Ryan Will. He memorized all the lines and his body movements were perfect. However, it was rejected again. Ryan Will, who was watching Seojun sighing, suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cWe\u2019ll start shooting Shadowman 2 in September.\u201dAt the sound of his voice, the couple\u2019s movement also stopped. Ryan Will, who saw Seojun\u2019s fluctuating eyes, unconsciously touched his face. He was gonna wait a little longer.\u201c\u2026Filming?\u201d\u201cYes, I can\u2019t help it.\u201dThe schedules of the other actors for Shadowman 2 and the released of other Marine films have been scheduled.Ryan Will has delayed the deadline as much as he can at his discretion. But that was also now impossible.Seojun opened his mouth.\u201cThen acting\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s film with the acting you did at the audition.\u201dSeojun was speechless. He has been practicing for 7 months, and now he is saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go with the first one.\u201d Seojun, who had barely moved his mouth, changed his words.\u201cAre my pictures still going around?\u201d\u201cEven the FBI can\u2019t get rid of it.\u201dHe said that the photos floating on the Internet will be somehow be removed, but it could not be removed from the photos that each individuals own. Even more if it\u2019s printed.Ryan Will and Seojun shook their heads.It was because there was a picture of Seojun printed by his own mother at Ryan Will\u2019s main house, and Kim Hee-sung even made a nice frame in Seojun\u2019s house.Lee Min-Joon and his wife hung them in their rooms.\u201cCome to think of it, some countries sell your picture as a souvenir, printed in a cup or a fan. Like a talisman that brings you good luck? I heard it\u2019s popular.\u201d\u201cUncle Ryan!\u201dSeojun, who was energized by Ryan\u2019s relaxed talk, screamed. After dozens of video calls, the two even shared jokes to each other.\u201cI mean, it came out so well. You\u2019re so into acting like an angel because it\u2019s Christmas Eve, isn\u2019t?\u201cDo you think I knew this would happen?\u201dSeojun pouted his lips. Back then, on Christmas Eve, he was so happy to hear that he used his ability to bless the whole world. He couldn\u2019t bear to say no to Ryan.Now only silence remained. Ryan Will spoke first.\u201cWhat do you think? Can you get ready?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeojun nodded his head. Just this time, let\u2019s use [Bubble Goblin\u2019s Teasing Kim] and next, let\u2019s practice harder.\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d* * *Jonathan watched Ryan and Seojun talk.Ryan, who informed him of the filming date, got up from his seat. The couple and Seojun also said goodbye.\u2018Did he came to Seojun\u2019s house and give acting guidance?\u2019 Jonathan, who had thought so, followed him out the door.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cTo revise the script.\u201d\u2018I thought It\u2019s already been fixed.\u2019 Jonathan saw Ryan pressing the button on the elevator.He said he found the perfect actor, and he was happy about it. But know he was adjusting the script for the same actor\u201cDo you want to make more corrections?\u201d\u201cThe actors are trying, but I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\u2018I think it\u2019s okay to change actors.\u2019 Jonathan wanted to say so but shut his mouth. Ryan, who has been filming for years, wouldn\u2019t want to hear about it.He was sure Seojun Lee knows. However, the two did not give up at all.Jonathan and Ryan got into the elevator. A heavy silence enveloped the two.* * *Seojun stood in front of the library. Director Ryan Will visited and gave the\u00a0 him filming schedule of Shadowman 2.\u201cSigh.\u201dNow it\u2019s August. Today, Seojun turned around and walked. The Good Life library, which had been shining brightly, gradually disappeared and behind Seojun\u2019s back darkness came.Not long after walking, he could see several doors. Unlike his original library doors, which had colorful colors, on this one only black doors were visible.The library\u2019s doors were covered with thick black chains.Seojun approached and touched the door of the library. The black chain did not react, let alone open the door.This dark library was a collection of bad past lives.\u201cThe library of Evil Lives.\u201dThere was only one way to unlock the chain and open the door. Seojun must have possess Black Mana.If Seojun had made the source using [Evil\u2019s Basic Breathing], the evil library here would have opened wide, and a thick white chain would have firmly surrounded the virtuous library.For the past eight months, this was his daily job, but he was still very nervous.Seojun breathed out to calm his nervous body. His Light Mana wriggled to see if it was influenced by the evil library.Seojun sat in front of a vicious library. He closed his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Seojun didn\u2019t give up and still continued.Seojun took a deep breath. The Light Mana was put aside and he started [Evil\u2019s Basic Breathing].The second wayWaiting for a New Door to Open from the Good Life Library.The third door opened wide like a birthday present, but there was no proper ability in it either.Given that Seojun seemed nicer, he is now agonizing over whether to open the Evil library\u2019s door or not.The Light Mana was the source of Seojun. And now Seojun needed to wait for the black mana to change his source.Third way.Opening the door to the Evil library.In order to open the door of it, Black Mana was needed.Seojun tried to shake off his impatience, but he seemed to be very nervous because he couldn\u2019t move a bit.Usually, when he decides to do something, he will have the will to do so. However, right now he is hesitating. But either way Good is good, evil is evil. There was no reason or need to choose between the two.As long as he could spend his life the way he wanted.He already did this method before. Starting with Light Mana, change it to Black Mana in order to open the Evil Library.It was the life of an elf who lived in order to avenge his tribe hunted by humans.The Good Elf tried to open the Evil library in the same way as Seojun is doing right now.Elf\u2019s life was long, and Elf had that much patience.However, before the Elf change his source to Black Mana, one of the elf hunters, who was the target for his revenge, fell ill and died.The Elf realized. Unlike himself, who had a long life span, humans, who were the subject for his revenge died too easily and very early.\u2018I longed for revenge. But what if it takes 10 years or even 100 years?\u2019The elf closed his eyes. \u2018I gave up.\u2019Using the bones of the Skeletons, the blood of the Vampires, and the flesh of the monsters,He became a devil.Seojun shook his head at thought of his previous life.However, the end of that life was doom.The Elf, who became the devil, killed humans and destroyed the Human kingdom, and Madness eventually took his head, that he even destroyed the kingdom of his fellow elves.His next life was a black Elf wizard who remembered his previous life, he read the Elf\u2019s life by opening the vicious library and warned him for his next life.\u201cWhoo.\u201dSeojun breathed out loudly.He don\u2019t know how long he had been working hard in front of the library.However, unlike elfs who live long ages, human life was short and the filming of Shadowman 2 will happen at even shorter time.Seojun performed [Evil\u2019s Basic Breathing] again.A lot of time went by, Seojun sighed and got ready to wake up.\u201cFirst of all, Shadowman 2 uses [Bubbly Goblin\u2019s Teasing Mr.Kim].\u201dHe looked at the evil library tightly closed and tied with black chains.\u201cKeep practicing and practicing, breathing and breathing. Soon I\u2019m going to open it.\u201dJust before waking up as always, Seojun\u2019s eyes were blurred.\u201cI won\u2019t appear in any other movies until then. I\u2019m not even going to do a drama!\u201dLike a warning, Seojun\u2019s firm words seemed to shake the library a little.* * *The Next daySeojun, who went to kindergarten as usual, practiced hard, went to bed, and opened his eyes in front of the library.As he sat in front of the Evil library he took a deep breath slowly.As if to suck all of the Evil coming from the Library.Seo-joon made an impression of controlling the ship, as if he were defeating an intruder.However, the Blck Mana who was discouraged by the spirited demeanor only hovered around Seojun\u2019s body but did not come inside his body.\u201cOh, my God.\u201d\u2018Is it impossible for two Mana to coexist?\u2019Seojun sat properly again and began to take a deep breath.\u2018Will the evil library doors never open in this life?\u2019Light and Black confronted each other outside and inside of his body.\u201cSo, I can\u2019t shoot anymore for the rest of my life?\u2019The library shook a little.Seojun closed his eyes and focused on [Evil\u2019s basic breathing], did not see what is happening around him.\u2018Can I be a superstar because I can\u2019t even act as a villain?\u2019Seojun breathed deeply and inhaled.It was then.The library of life moved.The Lighti and Black Mana was in unison circling him around. He mediated between the two manas and demanded cooperation.Sometimes the two were friendly to each other and sometimes they were devouring each other. But the Library growled, showing his teeth at the two disobedient manas.In the end, two manas held hands with disapproving expressions after being overwhelmed by the library\u2019s behavior.As if they were ready to let go each other\u2019s hand at any moment, only their pinkies held each other. (TL: imagine pinky swear but coming from enemies)This all happened while Seojun has his eyes closed tightly and focused only on breathing.\u2018Huh?!\u2019Black Mana was slowly entering deep into Seojun\u2019s body.His heart pounded. The Black Mana was also likely to run amok to defeat the Light Mana, but it didn\u2019t, it was just spinning around at his original source.\u2018What\u2019s going on?!\u2019\u2018What happened in my body?\u2019Seojun was just looking at the two Mana, but quickly came to his senses.\u2018Let\u2019s find the cause later\u2019Seojun decided to not waste this opportunity.\u2018Focus, focus, focus!\u2019He cheered on Black Mana with all his might. He did everything he could to soothe two manas in co-existing.And\u2026Finally, Black Magic united with his original Source. As if they were in a truce, the two manas circled each other. They were wary of each other. And gradually, it calmed down.At that time, a blessing alarm came in.[Evil\u2019s basic breathing is activated!]Maybe it was because Seojun was in a good mood at the two manas stayed together without any problems, and the notification made him happier.[Evil\u2019s basic breathing]The presence of evil evokes his Black Mana.It does not conflict with any other breathing methods. (Except Light)It harmonize with the body of the holder.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhh!Seojun shouted with his arms raised high. Shouting of joy.\u201cFinally! Finally!\u201dHe was so excited that he ran around inside the library.\u201cHahaha!\u201d\u2018I\u2019ve never been this excited since his birth!\u2019 He burst out laughing and ran around.Deng-deng. Deng-deng.\u201cHuh?\u201dHe could hear something falling from the library. Seojun looked back with a curious face. Three beads were rolling on the floor.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dSeojun picked up three beads. There were patterns on each of theme. It was a bead with a long stick pattern, a bead with a slime pattern, and a bear pattern.\u201c\u2026\u2026Eh?!!\u201dSeojun, who arranged the beads on the floor, quickly looked at the palm of his right hand and smoothed his stomach and back of his head.\u2018I don\u2019t have it. I don\u2019t have it!\u2019 Seojun face was now in disbelief. He couldn\u2019t feel the energy from this abilities.The only things in Seojun\u2019s body now were [Elf\u2019s Basic Breathing] and [Evil\u2019s Basic Breathing], not in the form of beads.\u201cWhy did it fall?\u201dSeojun was now in an awkward position because it was his first time to be in such a difficult situation, soon he came to his senses. It was because he realized that it was the first time Light and Black Mana had started to coexist with each other.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time two manas are together, so no one knows what\u2019s going to happen. First, let\u2019s put it in.\u201dSeojun grabbed the bead. It was Slime\u2019s ability to digest. And he put it in his stomach like he always did.There was now a slime pattern on his stomach. Then he put [Summer Bear\u2019s Hibernation] in the back of his head and [the orchestra conductor\u2019s connection] in his right palm.Fortunately, it still permeated into his body.\u201cWas it because of the sudden change in my Mana?\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes, which had been looking at his body for a long time, rolled around.\u201cI didn\u2019t know this would happen.\u2026.\u201dThe amount of Mana that he have been using freely so far has been reduced by half. Thus, the 100% was reduced to 50% and the Black Mana took the remaining 50.He could only use his full power for half a day.Of course, it was a source that would naturally grow as he grew older.\u201cI\u2019ve got another Mana, so this is fine.\u201dIt would only be possible if the ability was controlled and used only during filming.The Eight months of acting practice with Ryan Will was not in vain. So, practicing the same role every time, he was able to get away from Immerse acting for a little bit. He could now easily adjust.\u201cIt\u2019s only a little for now.\u201dSeo-joon turned around and looked at the Evil library, which was tightly closed.At Seojun\u2019s gaze, the black chain sensed Black Mana in Seojun\u2019s body and began to unravel with a loud sound.The chains that tied the black door disappeared in an instant.The large door, like from the Good Library, disappeared from his left and a smaller door appeared on his right. The door got smaller at Seojun\u2019s touch.The last small tightly closed door appeared.\u201cIt\u2019s starting again.\u201dSeojun put his right hand against the black door.Creak, creak.The door opened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had a headache trying to make lines that suits his initial audition during his free time, but he finally completed it.\u2018I can\u2019t say I am satisfied, but it\u2019s going to be a box office hit.\u2019Then, a he got received a message.When he looked at his cell phone, it was Seojun. On the message that Seojun had sent there was a video attached, Ryan Will played it.He had sent a video the day before yesterday in less than a week he sent another video. Ryan Will smiled faintly.\u201cYou have to be patient, Ryan.\u201d\u2018Why can\u2019t he just play the villain?Ryan Will folded his arms.In the past, villains were popular roles back then. Not being able to play a villain would blow up half of the roles an actor could do.Ryan Will really wanted to see Seojun Lee\u2019s villain performance.He wondered what kind of aura Seojun would emit with his small body and what kind of performance he would do.\u2018But now\u2026\u2026.\u2019Ryan Will turned on the video, barely holding back a sigh that was about to come out.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dOn the video\u2026There was a child smiling broadly surrounded by a chilly aura.Ryan Will book a flight to Korea immediately.It has been less than 24 hours since Seojun sent the video. Ryan Will\u2019s luggage was just a few scripts and a wallet because he got here in such a hurry.Then the conversation between Seojun and Ryan Will began.Ryan Will didn\u2019t say a word and just looked at Seojun after saying hello.Director Ryan\u2019s eyes looked at Seojun with a serious expression, from hair to toe. It was as if he just met Seojun for the first time.Seojun looked up with a triumphant look, holding back his laughter at Ryan\u2019s serious expression.He wanted to show off. He wanted to brag. The video he sent was worth of such arrogance.Ryan Will, who had been staring at him for a long time, opened his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019ve become normal.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThis was an unexpected assessment. \u2018Was it bad?\u2019 Seojun tilted his head.\u201cIn the past, you would have this atmosphere of kindness just by smiling.\u201dRyan Will crossed his head. Seojun\u2019s head moved along Ryan Will.\u201cNow, I don\u2019t feel anything. You became normal.\u201d\u201cIs that a good thing?\u201dRyan Will nodded at Seo Jun\u2019s question.\u201cFirst of all. There was nothing on the background whether it was white or black, and that\u2019s great.\u201dThen there was silence between the two again.\u201cHow did you do that?\u201dRyan Will broke the silence and opened his mouth first.\u201cUntil the last video, I\u2019m sorry to say this, but all your performances were very bad.\u201d\u201cYou said I did well,\u00a0 but why did you say that just now?\u201dSeojun pouted his lips. He wasn\u2019t really offended, director Ryan Will\u2019s eyes, gestures as he walked in through the front door, and tone really say otherwise.\u201cThat\u2019s because that is the past. Now\u2026\u2026.\u201dRyan Will replied with a very, very satisfied face.\u201cYour performance is the best.\u201dSeojun rolled his eyes at the sudden compliment.He thought it would be just a simple compliment, but he didn\u2019t expect to say that it was the best. However, Seojun couldn\u2019t hold back his smile because he was happy to hear a compliment from him after 8 months of being a constant disappoitment.\u201cRight? I did a great job, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cYes, so I burned all the Revised Script.\u201d\u201cThe revised script?\u201dBefore coming to Korea, Ryan Will burned the revised versions he had written in case Seojun didn\u2019t master acting as a Villain.\u201cI tried to minimize your appearance if you didn\u2019t solve it before the shoot.\u201dIt was the first time Seojun heard about this. He thought Ryan had faith in him, but he started editing the script.Seojun, who couldn\u2019t help but understand Ryan Will\u2019s decision, nodded. If he had watched him fail for the past the seven-month, no, eight-month, any director would have revised the script.It was really\u2026The worst.It must be really awkward and strange for a child to say villainous lines with a good aura. Viewers will feel like \u2018William\u2019 was pretending to be a Villain\u201cPeople will feel awkward about my acting if I act following the original script.\u201dRyan Will nodded his head. His smile stayed on. Ryan Will took out his first script as soon as he saw the video.Thinking about the Villaneous kid from the video becoming William, he couldn\u2019t have expected more. He flew to Korea because he couldn\u2019t stand not seeing him act in person.\u201cBut now you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201dThe two men smiled and the serious atmosphere disappeared.\u201cThen I\u2019d like to see you act myself, is that okay?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun came down from the chair. He squeezed his right hand to a punch.[The melancholy scent of a single flower is triggered][The melancholy scent of a single flower \u2013 the lowest level]This flower blooms in a radius of 10m.It looks similar to a weed, so no one knows it was a flower.People will feel depressed as soon as they smelled the flowers.In front of director Ryan Will, there was a child who felt abused and thus blamed the world.Ryan Will was satisfied with Seojun\u2019s performance. After the small performance of Seojun, he got ready to leave for America again.The couple tried to tell Ryan Will to go back after spending at least a night in their guest room to rest in between flights, but they had their mouth shut seeing Ryan Will\u2019s excited appearance, who had only spent 3 hours in Korea.Seojun\u2019s acting in person had a different atmosphere from the video.Wanting to go back quickly and read the 1st script off again, Ryan Will flew back to the U.S. on the fastest flight.After Ryan Will left, Seojun showed off to his mom and dad for a long time. The couple who watched Seojun\u2019s performance praised him for being so good.In that night Seojun fell asleep with great satisfaction.He was excited to enter the Evil library and from the two opened doors.Only two were opened, whether there was still a shortage of Black Mana or it requires more time. But soon the number of doors were the same.\u201cI hope it opens up soon, too! What kind of book is there?\u201dUnlike the past eight months where the atmosphere surrounding their house was depressing, the couple watch their son sleeping with a smile happily went to bed.And the day went by like that.Since it was the weekend, Seo Eun-hye went out to meet her friend, and Lee Min-joon will stay with Seojun.Seojun was brushing his teeth after lunch but he suddenly looked in the mirror.\u2018What was that?\u2019There was nothing on his head.\u201cIs it gone!?\u201dSeojun spat out the toothpaste bubble. Then he quickly rinsed his mouth with water and looked again in the mirror. There were no numbers. The Numbers were missing!\u201cDad, call the brothers! A Video call!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCall the brothers!\u201dLee Min-joon made a video call with a puzzled look on his face. The only brothers Seojun was talking about were Brown Black.Brown Black were busy with either practice or schedules, so he contacted Seo Eun-chan, who became the new president of Cocoa Entertainment, who looked like someone with many free.Seo Eun-chan, who was with Brown Black, picked up the phone and handed it over to Brown Black.\u201cGasp! Nothing!\u201dWhat? What\u2019s missing?Seojun\u2019s eyes widened.There were no numbers indicating the connection between the orchestra conductor, which would usually float above Brown Black\u2019s head.For a moment, he recalled the beads that fell off when his two Mana combined.\u201cNo way!\u201dThen, did it fall and reset? Isn\u2019t it too easy to be reset?!How long has it been since the beads fell? Seojun couldn\u2019t even hear Brown Black\u2019s voice calling him, and he fell into a deep thought while counting with his fingers.He open the library door, wake up and send the video, Ryan comes the next day, and it\u2019s morning again.\u2018It\u2019s been three days now!\u2019Three days is fine. Brown Black was on a break in order to fix the problems left by the former president of Cocoa Entertainment.Of course, even if it was a break, they would have sing to prepare for the next album.It\u2019s only been three days.Seojun asked urgently.\u201cHey, how was practice yesterday?\u201d\u201cPractice? It was the same as usual.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 How can I say it? You don\u2019t get along or you were not good enough.\u201dBrown Black shook their head in bewilderment.\u201cWe\u2019re in perfect harmony even after Christmas Eve.\u201dSeojun held his forehead. \u2018No, they must not know the effects of the skill. What should I do?\u2019His mind was in a state of tension.Seojun raised his head.\u201cWhat are you guys doing today?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a fan meeting later. We have been on hiatus since the beginning of this year so we decided to held a small even to meet our fans. Seojun, will you come?\u201cIf we have a fan meeting, you\u2019ll be performing, right? Will there be a lot of fans coming?\u201d\u201cEveryone had a hard time this time, so we invited as many as we could. Of course, we will be performing on stage. Our nickname is \u2018Performance Kings\u2019.\u201dSeojun nodded at Park Seo-jin\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019ll be there. What time does the fan meeting start?\u201d\u201cIt would start at one o\u2019clock, but if you come now, you\u2019ll be a little late. There would be another at 6 o\u2019clock time. You could still catch up for that event.\u201d\u201cOkay! We are leaving now! Dad, let\u2019s go!\u201dLee Min-joon was surprised and looked at Seojun. \u2018We will be late if we leave now, so how about six\u2026\u2019 Lee Min-joon, who was about that sentence, shut up and quietly put his cell phone, wallet and car keys on his packet.Seo Eun-chan sent them a text message.The venue was quite far, so It would take more than half an hour to arrive.\u201cCome on, Dad! Quick!\u201dSeojun stamped his feet. Lee Min-joon drove at the speed limit for his son\u2019s safety despite Seojun\u2019s urging.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Brother-in-law!\u201dSeo Eun-chan was waiting outside the fan meeting. He also looked at Seojun with a confused face.Seo Eun-chan guided the two inside the fan meeting. The passing employees and stage production employees greeted the president and Seo Eun-chan with a bow.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cUncle, have they already started?\u201d\u201cThey just started. They\u2019re on stage right now.\u201dSeojun opened his mouth. Oh no!Seo Eun-chan\u2019s voice sounded like a calamity to Seojun.\u201cAfter part one, you can meet at the backstage.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t they sing in part one?\u201d\u201cThey already sang a song since the fan meeting started after that they are going to talk to the fans and sing another song at the end. There are more stages in part two.\u201dSeojun let out a sigh of relief. Even if didn\u2019t arrive on time he can make up for it in part two. Their Idol Live\u2019s reputation can\u2019t be damaged!Seo Eun-chan and Lee Min-joon made eye contact as Seojun, was stamping on his feet.\u2018Hey, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Seo Eun-Chan whispers to Lee Min-joon Away from Seojun.\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019Lee Min-joon shook his head.Seo Eun-chan scratched his cheek a few times and opened his mouth.\u201cIf you go over there, you can see you guys having a fan meeting. Do you want to go?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cOkay, you have to watch it quietly.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeojun took Seo Eun-chan\u2019s hand and headed to his seat.It was close to the audience seats where the fans were sitting, but they didn\u2019t notice Seojun and Seo Eun-chan coming in because their eyes were on stages.Choi Si-yoon, who was on stage, noticed them and winked at the two. Seojun waved his hand, too.Lee Min-joon, who was talking to Seo Eun-hye on the phone, also sat next to Seojun.Brown Black was talking to fans on stage. The three sat down and watched the fan meeting.It was time to read the notes written by the fans in advance.Hwang Ye-joon grabbed the microphone and said with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing. \u2018CEO Seo Eun-chan, please take care of Brown Black! I\u2019d appreciate it if you could do it exactly as you did on you manager days did.\u2019 Eun-chan has already received this many notes.\u201dHwang Ye-joon put a note on the table. The contents of each notes were quite similar.\u201cWe\u2019re really happy that Eun-chan became the CEO. We are now able to talk comfortably about what we wanted. I hope we can continue to stay the same.\u201dFans clapped hard at Park Seo-jin\u2019s words. It was because Seo Eun-chan, who looked ugly among fans, was very trustworthy. They wish all good luck for Cocoa Entertainment\u2019s future moves.\u201cUncle, you\u2019re cool!\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dSeo Eun-chan smiled awkwardly. He was embarrassed at his nephew\u2019s compliment. It was his first time doing it, but many people supported him already, so he thought he must really do well.The first part of the fan meeting passed by in an instant and Brown Black announced the end of the first part. They now begin to prepare for the next part.Seojun, who became nervous again, clenched his fists.The older members are really good at it, but he was worried if they could satisfy their fans, without the skill, who had seen many of their performances so far.The stage was now over. Seo Eun-chan headed backstage with the airheaded Seojun..Seojun was very weird today.\u201cSeojun! You\u2019re really here!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him? He look lost within his mind.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s been doing it since this morning.\u201dSeojun came to his senses and called Brown Black, who were busy wiping their sweat.\u201cHey. How was the performance just now?\u201d\u201cThe stage just now?\u201dKevin, who was closest, answered with a tilted head.\u201cIt was good. Somehow it felt better than usual.\u201d\u201cI know. I danced better, too.\u201dChoi Si-yoon, who was stretching around, nodded. Park Seo-jin and Hwang Ye-jun, who were drinking water, also agreed.\u201cMy voice came out well and it was okay.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dSeojun opened his mouth wide.It was because even Seojun thought Brown Black\u2019s stage was cool.There wasn\u2019t even an orchestra conductor! Why?\u201cHow do you compare it to Christmas Eve?\u201d\u201cChristmas Eve, it\u2019s been over half a year. Do you still remember?\u201dSeo Eun-chan crossed his arms and asked back, but contrary to his opinion, Brown Black recalled the memory without hesitation.They remembered clearly on Christmas Eve. It was the time when they overcame their slump. It was a performance that they would never imagine.Park Seo-jin, who was thinking hard, opened his mouth first.\u201cIt was incredible back then, too. It was like someone was directing me to do this in the middle. Then I thought about that direction \u2018Oh, I should sing like this next time.\u2019 I must aim higher. That\u2019s how I should have to sing.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for me. As if someone was teaching me, everyone must follow the right direction. But now I think I can even do a solo dance.\u201dAll the four members nodded their heads. Hwang Ye-joon, shook his head and said.\u201cThe Christmas Eve stage? I feel like it was fixed and we just have to follow it. Compared to then, I didn\u2019t think about it, but I felt a bit free on this stage.\u201d\u201cNow I don\u2019t feel that you say it that way. Ye-joon is right. I didn\u2019t know until now, but I kept thinking about you guys on stage, so I felt a little frustrated.\u201dBrown Black nodded at Kevin\u2019s words.Frustrating. They were used to great performances and beyond imagination, so they didn\u2019t feel it, but they could feel it clearly with today\u2019s performance.Seojun withasked.\u201cThen it\u2019s goodbye to the old times. Do you like yourself more now?\u201d\u201cOf course, We feel better this way.\u201dSeojun nodded at Brown Black\u2019s answer.\u2018I see.\u2019The staff just came in time and announced the start of part two. Brown Black is ready to go back on stage. Choi Si-yoon asked Seo-joon.\u201cThen shall we go eat something delicious after part two? There\u2019s a really delicious marinated bulgogi restaurant near here.\u201d\u201cYeah! I\u2019m leaving, guys. Good luck on the stage!\u201dSeojun went back to his seat with Seo Eun-chan. Lee Min-joon, who was still sitting, welcomed the two. Seojun was lost in thought in the soft chair.Why? The usefulness of ability is undeniable. And yet they like how they are right now. Why?Seo Eun-chan and Lee Min-joon, sitting next to Seojun, made eye contact again. Lee Min-joon asked.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019Seo Eun-chan shook his head.Seojun could hear a conversation not far from him. It was a conversation between Brown Black fans sitting closest to him.\u201cI think today\u2019s stage is really good.\u201dPark Sung-ah asked Lee Mi-yeon\u2019s words.\u201cI didn\u2019t see much difference from the last time I watched them.\u201dLee Mi-yeon shook her head.\u201cWhat should I say about the previous performance? If it was a perfect performance that was made without any gaps, today\u2019s performance was a performance that showed their individuality well. There weren\u2019t any ad-libs on the Brown Black stage, but there was a lot today.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe audience became quiet.Everyone pricked their ears.They were fans who felt the difference between the previous stage and today\u2019s stage. They wondered why it felt different. Lee Mi-yeon didn\u2019t know that and smiled brightly and continued talking to her friend.Seojun also listened to the conversation between the two.\u201cIf the previous stage was an orchestra with a \u2018perfect conductor\u2019 who had to hide and hang out with other instruments, I think today\u2019s stage was a stage where various instruments playing in harmony with other instruments while showing off their skills and personality. They like today\u2019s stage better because each and every one of them shows their individuality well.\u201dSeojun realized.Individuality.Back then they can\u2019t play as they pleased and they have to move according to the conductor\u2019s hand.Seojun looked at the palm of his left hand. The pattern of the orchestra conductor glistened.He would not have felt the limitation of \u201cOrchestra\u201d if his skills were at the Lowest. He sure Brown Black\u2019s skills were weak.However, his skills have become stronger as his rank has risen to the lower level. And Brown Black\u2019s skills have also improved brilliantly over the years.The key was \u2018time\u2019 where the ability was not activated for a moment.Their previous stages were so perfect without any gaps that they couldn\u2019t show off their own selves.On the contrary, on this stage they could express themselves more.And Brown Black was better with expressing themselves.\u2018I don\u2019t need this anymore. I\u2019ll put it in the library when I get home.\u2019Then, two months later, Brown Black made a comeback with a new album that showed off each member\u2019s personalities.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe long-awaited month of September has finally arrived.This time, instead of Seo Eun-hye, Lee Min-joon decided to follow Seojun as his manager and guardian.Kim Hee-sung changed Lee Min-joon\u2019s schedule as promised. Of course, he didn\u2019t forget to give paperworks in Lee Min-joon\u2019s hands that could be done in the U.S. as well.The plane that left Korea spent a lot of time in the sky and just arrived in America.\u201cHi! Seojun!\u201d\u201cAuntie Nara!\u201d\u201cYou look like you\u2019re very excited every time you come here.\u201dNara arrived the airport and welcomed the two with big arms.Nara still had a short hair cut and wore black sunglasses. Seojun ran and hugged Nara.\u201cSeojun grew up a lot!\u201dThe two had good chemistry, laughed and held each other hands.People around him clapped for some reason. Lee Min-joon face became, he covered his face with one hand and sighed.Lee Min-joon and Seojun went inside Nara\u2019s car. The three left the airport with their seat belts fastened and headed for their own destination.Seojun looked out through the window. This was a city he had never been to before.After a while he saw big buildings. There were a lot of people, too. Not only locals but also tourists taking pictures here and there with cameras.Nara pointed toward one of the buildings.\u201cThat\u2019s the Empire State Building. It used to be the tallest building.\u201d\u201cWow.\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes sparkled.A city that doesn\u2019t fall asleep, New York.This city was the filming location for Shadowman 2.Nara dropped Seojun and Lee Min-joon off in front of the hotel and before saying goodbye he gave Seojun a lot of presents.Whenever Nara went shopping, she would buy things for Seojun, but the amount of gift she stackpiled was huge because she met him again only after almost a year.It was piled up inside a box next to their trolleys, and the box\u2019s height was higher than Seojun\u2019s height. Lee Min-joon agonized. How can they bring this back to Korea?\u201cThen I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d\u201cAuntie, are you going to work?\u201d (TL: Just realized that Nara and Kevin are siblings but Seojun calls one auntie and the other brother. The hierarchy is kind of messed up)\u201cNo, I have to go home. Then, good luck to your shoot. Call me if you need anything.\u201dNara started the engine and in a blink of an eye, she bolted.Lee Min-joon was holding the gift box reaching up to his chin and smiled.\u201cShe came from LA to New York just to give Seojun a gift. Nara is amazing.\u201d\u201cAuntie, you\u2019re awesome!\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s cool.\u201dSeojun and Lee Min-joon smiled and went inside the hotel with their trolleys and gifts from Nara.The next day.Seojun and Lee Min-joon went around the hotel after adjusting to the time difference and before the filming. During their walk, they received a call from director Ryan Will.Ryan Will briefly greeted Lee Min-joon, who answered the phone, asked Seojun.\u201cI don\u2019t think you had the chance to meet the other actors because you have been practicing and stayed in Korea. If you have time tonight, why don\u2019t you say hello to all of them?\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes turned towards Lee Min-joon.Lee Min-joon, who was listening next to him, nodded with a smile.\u201cOkay, but who would be coming?\u201d\u201cEvan Block and Rachel Hill. There are the two people who will work with you.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cText me where and when. Did you memorize the script?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dSeojun nodded to the phone when it wasn\u2019t even a video call.He just received the Script recently, but the smart Seojun already memorized every line he would utter.In addition, Seojun\u2019s emotional performance for Shadowman 2 was similar to the one-man drama he had practiced for eight months, so he could do it easily.\u201cAll right, see you later.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeojun hung up the phone, he was excited at the text message that arrived soon after the call ended. They went back to their rooms and pulled out the script for Shadow Man 2 from his bag.He thought he should practice his lines first before going. But he only read the lines of the two actors who he was about to meet, he would occasionally looked at the clock. The hour hand and minute hand did not seem to move.On the slower-than-usual clock, Seojun asked his innocent father.\u201cDad, dad. How long has it been?\u201d\u201cHmm. Five minutes?\u201dIt\u2019s already been 5 times since he asked for the time. Seojunvknows how to read the clock but he seemed to be really looking forward to meeting the two actors.Lee Min-joon opened his laptop, lay in the bed, and did his paperwork beside Seojun, who was readinhg the script again while looking at the clock.\u201cIf you\u2019re bored, why don\u2019t you look for a movie with two people until then?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun got up and sat next to his dad. He searched the names of the actors and found the movies where they starred in.Evan Block was already on Shadowman and Rachel Hill first appearance would be on Shadowman 2.The two were looking at Evan Block and Rachel Hill\u2019s filmography and found it interesting.\u201cThere\u2019s also a movie where the two of them appeared together.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s watch this!\u201d\u201cShould we?\u201dLee Min-joon and Seojun talked to each other while watching the Romance movie \u201cWith\u201d starring the two actors.The movie \u201cWith\u201d was a movie that couldn\u2019t be watched without chewing popcorns.***\u201cI love this scene the most.\u201dRachel Hill looked at the big television screen with a look of admiration.\u201cThe CG is no joke, but the acting is great.\u201dEvan Block nodded at Rachel Hill\u2019s words. Clearly, the inner conversation with God was later inserted.No matter how good at editing, how can it be so natural?\u201cLast year, the director contacted me to have me in the movie together with Seojun Lee, so I wanted to watch one of his movies. I didn\u2019t expect the director to send me a copy of the whole because the screening in America finished.\u201d\u201cRight, we need to know the other person\u2019s capabilities.\u201dRachel Hill shook her head. Evan Block opened his [Seojun Lee] note from his bag. Rachel Hill \u2018tsk\u2019 her tongue at the sight of his notebook, which was full of notes.\u2018There\u2019s a note with my name on it.\u2019She wanted to read what kind of evaluation he made for her, and she was, of course, afraid of reading negative opinions coming from him. Rachel Hill chewed on popcorn.\u201cAnother analysis time? So, what do you think? What about Jun\u2019s acting? People say it\u2019s Immerse acting.\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dEvan Block looked back at the screen, smoothing his chin. The golden fire was moving around on the screen. Evan Block\u2019s blue eyes glittered through the light.\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cHow come you\u2019re so into acting?\u201dRachel Hill looked at the screen. There was a child in red with flapping clothes. He acted so natural and skillful that one may have thought he would have done such a thing since he was born.Evan Block slowly opened his mouth.\u201cRyan advised Melissa Walton to play another role if possible.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dA year ago, officials in Hollywood focused on Melissa Walton.Inspired by her desperate tears, directors sent Melissa Walton a love call with similar roles, but she all refused and acted in a romance comedy film.It wasn\u2019t a huge hit, but many said it was a movie that showcases Melissa Walton\u2019s new charm.\u201cAccording to the people on the set, Melissa Walton couldn\u2019t get out from the role crying even after the shoot, but there wasn\u2019t Seojul Lee. There was no child who lost his mother, there was only a child who enjoyed orange juice. That\u2019s how Ryan noticed it.\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\u201cEven if she played a similar character, Melissa Walton wouldn\u2019t get out easily if she played the same role. Seojun Lee was different.\u201dEvan Block\u2019s eyes sparkled. Rachel Hill hesitated and asked.\u201cHe\u2019s special. This is his gift. He made another actor immersed in their own acting. What kind of monstrous talent he possessed to point of affecting another actor?\u201dEvan Block grinned and opened his note. There were a lot of questions he wanted to ask Seojun Lee. Rachel Hill backed away from Evan Block a little.\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet him.\u201d\u201c\u2026Seojun Lee, I think you should hide now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seojun and Lee Min-Joon, staying at a hotel a few blocks away, arrived a few minutes later.\u201cHello! I\u2019m Seojun Lee!\u201d\u201cHi, Seojun Lee. I\u2019m Rachel Hill.\u201d\u201cPlease call me Jun!\u201d\u201cThen, call me Rachel.\u201dSeojun shook Rachel Hill\u2019s hand happily and took Evan Block\u2019s hand next.\u201cHi, you\u2019re Seojun Lee, aren\u2019t you? My name is Evan Block. Call me Evan.\u201d\u201cYes, Evan! I look forward to your kind cooperation! Please call me Jun!\u201dRyan Will introduced Lee Min-Joon, who was next to Seojun.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Evan Block, playing Shadowman and Mac.\u201d\u201cHello, I\u2019m Rachel Hill. I will be Jun\u2019s sister for a while.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you. I look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201dEvan smiled merrily and shook his head.\u201cI think I\u2019m the one who should be nice to you. I saw a movie where you acted, and it was no joke. I\u2019d get buried of your talent.\u201dEvan Bullock had watched the evil spirit to the point he crumpled the cup of soda in his hand out of tension. It was a relief that he drank it all before doing so, or It would have been spilled all around him.Seojun tilted his head.\u201c\u2026Shadowman?\u201d\u201cNo, \uc545\ub839 (aryong). Hmm. Is this how you pronounce it? The Devil is the title in English, but I prefer the original title to the translated title.\u201dEvan Block winked one eye and lowered himself. Seojun\u2019s head became comfortable because he didn\u2019t have to look up anymore.Seojun smiled brightly. He was happy and grateful that someone watched \u2018The Devil.\u2019\u201cYes, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you. What did you think when you acted? Do you tend to make a thorough plan and postpone it? Or do you act with your gut feeling? I heard that sitting and waking up during William\u2019s scene was your idea. Is it true?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026.\u201dHere comes Evan, the \u2018ActingAnalystt.\u2019 He poured out all questions he was thinking of while analyzing Seojun\u2019s acting. Seojun stared blankly at Evan Block\u2019s face. Rachel Hill covered her face with her hands, and Ryan Will just smiled.Lee Min-Joon, who was listening to the conversation between the two, could only recall a rumor about Evan Block floating on the Internet.Acting Analyst.Evan Block\u2019s performance consisted of detailed character analysis and thorough planning. He even planned and acted on hand tremors and facial muscles.Even the directors and actors who filmed with him were impressed by his planning. It was a nickname that was given to him like that.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s eat first. I\u2019m hungry! Oh, you two, too. Does Jun\u2019s leg hurt, too? Sit down.\u201dRachel Hill pushed Evan Block in the back. Evan Block, who didn\u2019t get to hear the answer until the end, shrugged and sat down.When everyone sat down, Rachel sighed relief when she saw Ryan calling for a waiter and smiled at Seojun.\u201cJun, you look taller than in the movie.\u201dSeojun, who was sitting on the chair, straightened his back, smiled, and said proudly.\u201cI grew 10 centimeters in a year!\u201dIt was all thanks to the Slime\u2019s ability to digest. It was a very precious ability that let him send a lot of nutrients to every corner of his body promptly.He was also the tallest in kindergarten. Wouldn\u2019t he still be the biggest in his class even after he enters elementary school next year? All the family members were talking about it.The waiter in charge brought the food he ordered in advance.The waiter opened the private room door he was in charge of every day without thinking much, but today his eyes shook greatly.The waiter was a Marine Fan. Even after seeing his idols, he put on a professional, expressionless face.Oh! Oh! Let him be amazed inside.\u2018Oh, Evan Block! He\u2019s very tall! The child beside him if he\u2019s Asian\u2026 Seojun Lee! Besides, Rachel Hill and Ryan Will! This should be Shadowman 2..\u2026!\u2019He wanted to take out the camera right away. However, he endured it and closed the door of the private room after finishing everything.\u2018Can I get their autograph after the meal?\u2019After having their fill, the five began their conversation. Evan Block opened his mouth first.\u201cWhat do you think of William?\u201d\u201c?\u201dSeojun, who was chewing steak, tilted his head. He quickly chewed the meat in his mouth and answered.\u201cPoor thing?\u201d\u201cHowever, you don\u2019t want to like William, are you?\u201dIn the end, Ryan and Rachel\u2019s eyes turned towards Seojun.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with that? William is the character I am acting for in the movie, and I\u2019m Lee Seojun.\u2019Seojun shook his head.\u201cNo, not at all. I\u2019m Lee Seojun.\u201d\u201cLook, it\u2019s special.\u201dEvan laughed whether he liked the answer. Rachel shook her head. When Lee Min-Joon tilted his head, Rachel explained.\u201cI see. Immersed acting\u2026\u2026.\u201dLee Min-Joon doesn\u2019t know how to act, but he knew one or two when it comes to immersed acting.Although it was a frequent acting method by actors who were good at acting, there were often episodes that actors were so immersed in the role that they were confused with reality.\u201cJun\u2019s performance is completely different from the Immersed Acting, you know.\u201dEvan Block nodded in agreement. Ryan Will went on.\u201cJun can get out of the role perfectly. It\u2019s completely different from Immersed acting, which has a drawback to the emotions and thoughts of the actor. If he really did method acting, he would have lost himself and stayed as William for a while.\u201dWho would have expected that little boy to act like that? Even Seojun himself never thought he would fall that far.At that time, if Seojun hadn\u2019t gotten out of the role, Ryan Will would have told his child\u2019s guardian not to act on the spot.But Seojun Lee was different. He patted himself on the back, saying he did a good job and smiled broadly with joy at his self-compliment.\u201cBut he came back to Jun as if I hadn\u2019t been another character.\u201dWhen he saw Seojun, who was only five years old, Ryan Will got goosebumps performing such a wonderful performance and smiling brightly.\u201cJun\u2019s acting is similar to Immersed acting, but not the immersed acting itself. I knew for sure during the long eight months of practice. Jun will be the only actor who can get out of a role easily.\u201dRyan Will took a sip of wine.Although he didn\u2019t see much, Seojun was different from other actors.So during an eight-month practice session, Ryan kept his toes up. It was to stop when there was anything wrong with the acting with the first villain.However, contrary to Ryan\u2019s concerns, Seojun was the same as usual. He looked nice. He didn\u2019t give up, and he finally did it perfectly.Rachel Hill, who was listening to the story, asked Seojun.\u201cWhat do you think, Jun?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dSeojun thought hard. Everyone kept their mouth shut and focused on Seojun\u2019s mouth. Seojun looked left and right before opening his mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing Immersed acting.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dEvan unfolded the Notebook he had brought. Rachel Hill, who looked disgusted at the sight of Evan, moved her chair a little to the side.\u201cImmersed acting affects reality, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re worried. Will my role affect reality? I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to.'\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBut I was normal when I did William, I was fine when I was a demon, and I was still me when I played a child who blamed the world for eight months.\u201dHe definitely gets into character when he is filming. What kind of actor doesn\u2019t get into character?However, after filming, Lee Seojun still likes monster dolls. Look at the slime doll on the bag. He was still himself.\u201cSo it\u2019s not Immersed acting. I\u2019m just good at acting.\u201dSeojun said proudly. Everyone laughed at his answer.\u201cThen how do you act?\u201d asked Evan Block. Seojun thought for a while and replied.\u201cHmm, I think about a character like myself. I think his past to be mine, and what would he become now if he had passed like that. There are times when I think of something better during the start of the filming. My body moves naturally. That\u2019s what I did when I was William.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely similar to Immersed acting.\u201d\u201cBut I can get out of the role perfectly..\u201dMaybe\u2026Seojun thought.Isn\u2019t Immersed acting the ability of his body?Like a skill that he can use in the next life, like the abilities of other lives.And wouldn\u2019t \u201cspirit\u201d be different from ordinary method acting, which is hard to get out of the role because he has a library of life?The talent for ordinary method acting with a special set of skills.\u2018If I could make this ability into a bead, it would pop up like this.\u2019[(Good or bad?) Lee Seojun\u2019s special immersed acting]When filming, it gives him a sense of immersion as if he is in a real role.Also, he can completely get out of the role with his own will.What would the rating be like? Seojun, who was laughing inside, asked Evan Block.\u201cHow do you act, Evan?\u201d\u201cI study the character, plan and analyze.\u00a0 For example, Mac is an orphan. I\u2019m an orphan, but there are many good people around me. Why are there so many? Isn\u2019t it because of his bright and cheerful personality? Then, I analyze Mac\u2019s behavior one by one and think about the direction of his eyes and the location of his feet. If I know someone who has a similar personality to Mac, I observe them. There are times when even a small habit helps with filming. So my friends hate me when I get a movie script. This is how I act confidently in the movies that I appear in.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes sparkled at Evan\u2019s words. That\u2019s how he can act like that.The two actors talked hard about their way of acting. Rachel Hill also stepped in between.\u201cEvan Block would be more dangerous if it was Immersed act. After such thorough preparation, there will be a time when he feels inadequate. To fill the shortfall, and it will eventually affect reality.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cIt would be convenient to think that Jun is an actor with a natural talent for acting. He\u2019s a smart kid. He is not going to do anything that would harm him.\u201d\u201cNo matter how smart a child is, parents are bound to worry.\u201dLee Min-Joon laughed as he saw his son talking with the two actors excitedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I guess they are shooting a movie here.\u201d\u201cI know. I wonder which movie is it?\u201dTourists, looking around Central Park, looked up and saw a place where many people gathered.Central Park, a park in the heart of Manhattan, New York, USA, is also one of the most popular places for filming movies.The locals are accustomed to seeing a movie being filmed here, turned back to the voices they heard while passing by without thinking much.\u201cEvan Block?! Are they going to shoot Shadowman 2?!\u201dIn front of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, the largest area in Central Park, the cameramen of Shadowman 2 are gathered.The staff installed several tents to block the sunlight while waiting for the shooting to start. In comparison, the electrical staff installed the large cameras and lights.There were two people sitting on the first installed tent.Tourists who came to New York from various countries unknowingly lowered their voices to let the two people read the script in peace.They were Evan Block and William.\u201cWilliam, he had grown up a lot.\u201d\u201cThe Shadowman film was released a year ago, and also kids grow up in the blink of an eye.\u201d\u201cWow! The first movie was really heartbreaking becak then. I\u2019m looking forward to how it will turn out on Shadowman 2.\u201dSome staff ran toward the tent where the two people were sitting. Soon, the two people got up from their seats.\u201cThey\u2019re starting to shoot now.\u201dFilming for Shadowman 2 has finally begun.Seojun, who just changed his clothes and finished his makeup, appeared. Evan Block was already finished readying himself and was already reading a book while sitting on the chair.\u201cJun. I think you\u2019re taller than before.\u201dWhen asked by Evan Block, Seojun sat in a chair and showed him his shoes off. They were slightly bigger than regular sneakers.\u201cMy arms and legs are long, and my proportion is good, but they still wanted me to be a little taller. The insoles of these shoes are 4cm. It\u2019s soft and comfortable to wear. Because I grew taller and had my bangs back, my young self from the first film isn\u2019t noticeable anymore.\u201dBack then, William was a cute and lovely boy with light blue clothes. But now he was wearing black clothes and makeup, making him a little pale. It was very different from the first William.\u201cWhat about your father?\u201d\u201cHe is working.\u201dLee Min-Joon was sitting next to Evan Block\u2019s manager, talking on the phone. He didn\u2019t forget to wave when he made eye contact with Seojun from time to time.\u201cEvan! Jun!\u201dJonathan, who is now a high school student, was still helping Ryan Will to film.\u2018Is Jonathan not studying at all?\u2019 Seojun wondered when he saw Jonathan running towards them.\u201cWe\u2019re going to start the rehearsals soon.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dEvan Block and Seojun stood up from their seats. At the same time, cheers came from the mouths of the people watching.Unlike when they were sitting down, they could see the two actors standing up in just one glance.In particular, their whole attention was focused on Seojun.-Shadowman and William are here at Central Park. I look forward to the release of Shadowman 2!-William has really grown up! How many years has it been?-William grew up a lot. What did he eat to grow that big?News from the United States is also trending in Korea. There was even News written by the Local Media.[Shadowman 2 in Central Park][Shadowman 2 shooting begins!][How tall is actor Lee Seojun?][Is this the average height of the kids nowadays? Or is it less than that? How to grow taller!]-Wow, I guess they are filming now.-If you look at the angel picture, he seemed to be a hero rather than a villain.JH: He really grew up a lot! But just looking at the baby\u2019s mukbang, I thought, \u2018If he eats that well, It\u2019s no wonder he grew up that tall.\u2019The main shooting has begun.Seojun searched the library. There were many lives in the library.He needed to find an appropriate ability for this shooting.They are many terrifying abilities. Even so, Seojun didn\u2019t take any bead at random.\u2018But I\u2019m glad I found the right one.\u2019In this shoot, he was going to use [(First) Baron Cat\u2019s Elegant Step \u2013 Lower level]Elegant steps and posture will be ingrained in his body.By using this ability, he can do the right posture without even thinking.The baron cat was the first baron born as a cat.It was a pet of a noblewoman who taught etiquette, and she taught her cat as a joke. But the queen applauded the cat for its elegant appearance, better than anyone else.As a result, the cat became a baron due to the queen.\u201cLet\u2019s start filming!\u201dSeojun breathed in and out.William\u2019s life in the script appeared in his mind. He was a nice and kind kid.He needed to appear good like what Ryan Will said.[E.L.F\u2019s basic breathing starts]Light Mana, which was at the source of Seojun, moved vigorously as if he had finally met the world. While the Black Mana snorted and remained still.\u201cReady!\u201dSeojun heard Director Ryan Will\u2019s voice.[(First) Baron Cat\u2019s Elegant Step \u2013 Lower level]And waiting for the director\u2019s signal,\u201cAction!\u201dHe immersed himself in the role.The child is lost.The child didn\u2019t know where he was right now. For the first time in his life, he was in an unknown place. He looked at the Onassis Reservoir and its surroundings with a puzzled face.Someone was looking at the child. It was Mac. He was working as a guide for a part-time job at Central Park.Mac was wearing a guide vest and headed toward the child.\u201cLittle boy.\u201dThe child raised his head to see who was the one talking.Mac recalled the team leader\u2019s words of bringing lost children to the center if he found. He kneeled, made eye contact with the child, and smiled. He must not let him cry!\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d\u201cAt home.\u201d\u201cDo you have a house in Manhattan?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dMac scratched his cheek at the child\u2019s short answer. The child noticed that the adult in front of him showed no sign of leaving. He moved his mouth. A small smile appeared on the pale face of the little boy.\u201cMy family is coming. You can leave now.\u201d\u201cWhen will they come here?\u201dThe child looked through his memories. \u2018I\u2019ll pick you up when the sun goes down.\u2019He remembered the voice of the only woman he relied on.Looking at the child\u2019s behavior lost in his thoughts, he could see that each of the child\u2019s gestures was elegant.\u201cWhen the sun goes down\u2026\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dMac turned on his cell phone and looked at the weather.Here, in September, the sun did not set until 7 p.m., and the time now is 1 p.m., where the sun was floating right above their heads.\u201cYou have to wait for another 6 hours\u201d.He could see the anxiousness over the child\u2019s face. 6 hours. That\u2019s too long.Mac smiled and turned on the walkie-talkie and contacted his team leader. He spoke quietly so that the child would not hear him.\u201cThere\u2019s a lost child here.\u201d-Lost child? Bring him to the center.\u201cRather than the center\u2026Can I play with him? He didn\u2019t seem to want to leave Central Park.\u201d-You? Why?\u201cHis family says they\u2019ll pick him up at 7 o\u2019clock, but it would be frustrating to stay at the center for six hours.\u201d-Okay\u2026 your part-time job hours will end in just a few minutes anyway.-Till 7 o\u2019clock? Okay? Send the vest and walkie-talkie back to the center after your shift.\u201cThank you!\u201dMac ran toward the child with a smile.\u201cDo you want to hang out with me until 7?\u201dThe child, who was lost in thought for a while, nodded gently.\u201cCut! Okay!\u201dThey heard Ryan Will\u2019s voice.When the camera stopped rolling, Seojun quickly jumped twice with his feet to shake off his excitement.The good atmosphere quickly became normal.Evan Block, who saw the difference right in front of him, opened his eyes wide. It was Evan Block who believed that small actions and habits created the person\u2019s atmosphere. So I used to analyze people more and add details to the acting.But Seojun Lee was different. Even though he looked like standing in the same place, the atmosphere around him quickly changed as if he had turned on and off the switch.\u2018Is this his talent?\u2019 Now, there is another thing he could use for his notebook to analyzed Seojun. Evan Block grinned.One of the tourists watching the shooting between the two actors whispered to his friend to not disturb the filming.\u201cI think I\u2019ve seen him somewhere.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026\u201dThe face of the child smiling brightly passed by Emma\u2019s head, who was having difficulties recalling her memory.\u201cThe picture you sent me!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dEmma\u2019s friend searched through her memory to which she was referring. It was a picture floating on the Internet, so she didn\u2019t know who the child was in the picture. Her friend, who was looking at Seojun, soon noticed it.He is kind and sweet, just like the picture.\u201cI think it\u2019s really him.\u201d\u201cWow.\u201dEmma held her hands tightly. She wanted to say thank you if they could meet someday.Now it was time to film scenes where the child and Mac became close as they walked around inside Central Park.\u201cDo you want to play?\u201d\u201cI like it!\u201dWhen Mac threw the ball at the baseball stadium in Central Park, the child hit a light hit it with a baseball bat.Mac, no, Evan Block admired him sincerely. Baseball enthusiasts applauded sincerely after the shoot and said, \u201cIt was a perfect hit. It would have been a home run if he had more strength.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He doesn\u2019t think so. Currently, Evan is thinking hard about how Mac acts in front of children.Sitting on a rock and yawning, the snow leopard made eye contact with Seojun, who had just finished filming inside the zoo.Keung-Keung-.The snow leopard tilted his head and wandered in front of Seojun. There was a large glass wall between them, but it didn\u2019t take its eyes off Seojun.\u201cThis Snow Leopard seems to like you.\u201dAt Evan Block\u2019s words, Seojun moved to the right. The snow leopard also moved to the right. As he moved to the left, the snow leopard followed him. Everyone looked surprised at this sight.\u201cHmm. Is it because of Baron Cat?\u201d\u2019Seojun nodded and disabled Baron Cat\u2019s elegant steps. The snow leopard, who had been following him for several times, tilted his head and went back to his seat, and yawned.Throughout the filming in Central Park, the two actors really enjoyed sightseeing and talking to each other.They felt like the enjoyment was also conveyed to others. They did not only for filming a movie but also made a promotional video of Central Park. Even a Central Park employee guiding the filming team asked if it would be okay to use some footage as a promotional video after its release later.While filming, wouldn\u2019t Seojun Lee\u2019s role on the Internet be a hero? Many posts began to come up. Photos of the two actors surrounded by staff members were also posted.During the break, after Seojun and Evan Block shooting, Jonathan summarized the posts floating on the Internet and informed it to director Ryan Will.\u201cJun looks like a hero. Many fans say so. There were many asking about why William, who disappeared inside the wormhole, is in Central Park. \u2018He grew a lot, but isn\u2019t he too different from Shadowman?\u2019 There were comment like that, too.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dDirector Ryan Will nodded.Filming in Central Park was also part of Shadowman 2\u2019s promotion. While, important scenes of Shadowman 2 were planned to be filmed on set for security. The filming in Central Park ended in a friendly atmosphere.\u201cJun. This.\u201dJonathan showed a letter to Seojun, who was busy removing his makeup.\u201cYou fan gave it to me. Let me check the content first. If the content is good we will let you read it.\u201dSeojun replied that it was okay. Jonathan and the staff quickly headed to another tent.Lee Min-Joon smiled. He was happy, as a parent, seeing everyone treating Seojun preciously.Jonathan handed Seojun a clean open envelope. His eyes were a little red.\u201cThis is the letter. I guess she\u2019s really your fan.\u201dSeojun opened the letter. The letter was written in a hurry but still very neat.The sender of the letter was Emma, she was someone who has depression but managed to escape from the loneliness after seeing Seojun\u2019s picture.Although it was still not totally cured, it was clear that she felt indebted to him. Now she can travel abroad and enjoy life.The letter ended by asking him to act for more movies in the future.\u201cGood for you!\u201dSeojun cherished the fan letter in his bag. It would have been good if his photo helped many people during hard times.Seojun and Lee Min-Joon carried their bags to return to their accommodation.\u201cBut the fan really recognized me. Dad. Didn\u2019t I have a very different image?\u201dLee Min-Joon pondered. Seojun smiling brightly in white angel clothes, and Seojun, who looked a little pale in black clothes.When they were filming around Central Park, he could eavesdrop some conversations.\u201cYou were slightly different, but some would quickly recognized you. If someone looked at the picture and asked if it was you, they would realize that you are the same person.\u201d\u201cSigh. I see.\u201d\u2018I can\u2019t believe it. Even if I became taller, and my hairstyle is different, people would still recognize me. As Director Ryan said, the picture taken on Christmas Eve must have been really impressive. (TL: Why didn\u2019t the Author released a chapter of what happened back in Christmas Eve. I am now very curious.)\u201cStill.\u201dSeojun smiled. His Black Mana wrggled as if he was announcing his presence to Seojun. His efforts was still rewarded after all.\u201cIf they watch the movie until the end, they\u2019ll forget everything soon!\u201dSeojun was going to do his best to make that happen. No one will remember the Angel Seojun.After the filming in Central Park, they were now going to film on set.With Ryan\u2019s permission, Seojun stepped on the completed indoor set with his father. Jonathan took the role of being the guide.Lee Min-Joon and Seojun, who saw the movie set for the first time, were amazed.It was perfect as if there was an art exhibit. People\u2019s photos and notices were written on the wall, and people\u2019s last things were displayed on the glass exhibition table at the center.\u201cIt\u2019s really looks like an exhibition hall, Jonathan-Hyung.\u201d\u201cThe art team had a hard time making it, and I helped a little bit.\u201dJonathan said shyly. Seojun, who was walking along the arrows marked on the floor, read a notice in Korean and other languages.\u201c\u2026\u2026An alien invasion creates abnormal wormholes around the world. This is a picture of Ray Kasman, a high school student who went missing at that time. You wrote all of these?\u201d\u201cThese days, people take screenshots and analyze the background. I left all of this to the translators. If I write something without knowing the language, I\u2019ll become crazy.\u201cWow.\u201dThere were as many stories as the picture attached here. The writer must have been amazing. Seojun and Lee Min-Joon slowly looked around the set.Jonathan quietly followed the two. There were many picture of people who disappeared into the wormhole smiling broadly hunging on the wall. These pictures must have come from their families, they were full of memories, from old photos to recent photos.As they looked around one by one, a picture caught the eye of the two people.\u201cMy picture!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s William!\u201dIt was a photo that Ryan Will asked Seo Eun-Hye to send. It was a picture of the Four-year-old Seojun, smiling brightly.Lee Min-Joon\u2019s eyes became blurry as he looked at the picture.Looking at his son\u2019s picture here, he really felt uneasy.The memorial hall was so well-established that his heart ached.\u201cYou were so young!\u201d\u201cPfft. I am still young.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dThey soon laugh at Seojun\u2019s words.Seojun saw a notice next to William\u2019s picture. It was a letter from William\u2019s parents posted along with an ordinary notice.Seojun and Lee Min-Joon slowly read the letter. It was a letter from a parent wishing for the happiness of their child.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the original letter that the Screenwriter wrote. He wrote another after seeing Melissa\u2019s acting in Shadowman 1.The director also liked it, saying it was better this way.\u201dJonathan explained. Lee Min-Joon and Seojun nodded. They don\u2019t know what the previous letter is about, but this letter really covered their despair of losing their child.* * *\u201cLet\u2019s start filming!\u201dDirector Ryan Will shouted. The minor actors, who played the acquaintances of the victims, were now in the memorial hall sitting while waiting for the shooting to start.Seojun, who was talking to Evan, also stood up from his seat. His clothes was the same as it was back in Central Park, and his shoes remained the same.Evan Block and Seojun stood at the entrance of the memorial hall.Director Ryan Will, who was looking at the monitor, shouted. Several cameras were directed at two people.The actors recalled their lines, and the staff held their breath.\u201cReady.\u201dSeojun tapped the floor twice with his feet.[(First) Baron Cat\u2019s Elegant Step \u2013 Lower level]\u201cAction!\u201dMac and the child entered an exhibition hall in the Central Park.Unlike other places in the lively Central Park, this place was tranquil and full of silence.Some people were looking at the pictures on the wall with a sad face and others were about to burst into tears.Mac didn\u2019t utter any sound in that solemnity.\u201cThis is a memorial hall. It was created to commemorate those who disappeared due to the wormhole a year ago, those who went missing, and those who died.\u201d\u201cWhat is a wormhole?\u201cYou\u2019re still young, so you don\u2019t remember. At this time a year ago, aliens invaded the Earth.\u201dThe child blinked.\u201cThey attacked the Earth, saying they were from Natra and that they were here to find a traitor.\u201dMac bit his lips. Why did he do that? In the end, they won, but there were many wounds left.The child look at him blankly. Why does that word sounds familiar?\u201c\u2026\u2026Natra.\u201d\u201cYeah. This person had a wedding that day. And an abnormal wormhole was formed on the platform where the bride and groom were standing, and the bride was swallowed. This is the bouquet that the bride had that day.\u201dMac pointed towards a picture of a woman and a man smiling happily.Mac slowly looked at the picture and explained. The story of what happened that day, the people who were left behind, and things like relics. The dried bouquet looked like a family member with fallen petals left.\u201cI think he did something wrong, too.\u201dThe person who kept standing in front of the picture of a man smiling with a soccer ball said. The brutal voice rang the quiet memorial hall.\u201cThat guy, what did he say he is called? Shadowman? Why didn\u2019t he defeat aliens from the beginning? If he had done it before they start creating a wormhole, this wouldn\u2019t have happened!\u201d\u201cCalm down, calm down.\u201dA friend who came with him comforted him. He lost his best friend right in front of his eyes.An abnormal wormhole was created at the travel destination he proposed to go. The photos and relics of his friend who disappeared into the wormhole were here at the memorial hall.And today was his birthday. He shouted in an angry voice.\u201cIsn\u2019t the traitor that aliens were looking for is actually Shadowman? it must have been him! If it weren\u2019t for him, this wouldn\u2019t have happened! He said he was a hero! But Why? Why didn\u2019t you save my friend?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mac and the child looked at their backs.Mac became heavy-hearted. From the time Natra invaded until now, he had been agonizing all year long, but he still haven\u2019t found an answer.\u2018If I wasn\u2019t born\u2026. Wouldn\u2019t this have happened without me being born? Am I really the traitor they\u2019ve been looking for?\u2019It was the child who woke him up from his self-condemnation by holding his hand.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh. That\u2019s the kid who disappeared into the wormhole that day.\u201dThe child saw a picture on the wall. The child possessed black eyes and black hair, he was smiling broadly. And next to it was a picture of the same child holding a teddy bear.But, somehow, he looked familiar. Mac, who had a sense of familiarity with the child in the picture, turned his head. The child, he was with, was also staring blankly at the picture.Mac was looking at the picture and the child alternately and tilted his head.\u2018I think the two look alike.\u2019It seemed that the child in the picture would grow up like this child after five or six years.The child couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the picture for a moment.\u201c\u2026 What does it say?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dMac slowly read the notice. It was the victim\u2019s family that Mac personally met a year ago. The image of the woman crying to death was still clear in his head. His heart ached.\u201cDear William\u2026 I didn\u2019t even expect you to disappear in a moment like that.Why didn\u2019t I run faster, why wasn\u2019t I with you? I regret it every day.I really hope you stay alive.Just live happily wherever you are. Even if we can\u2019t spend time with you, we\u2019ll be able to have hope if you\u2019re still alive. You\u2019ll be happy.Mom and dad will wait for you forever.I\u2019ll wait for you at my house anytime you come.Come back anytime.I love you, mom and dad.\u201d\u2018William.\u2019At that word, the child\u2019s eyes grew bigger. The child held the pendant hanging on his neck tightly in his hand. One word that remains in his head from the time he started remembering things.William.Only then, all the puzzles were put together.He could tell.This is was his hometown. That little child his. He has a family waiting for him.Something came up in his eyes. The child\u2019s head clearly remembered his family members who were having a happy day. Everyone in Central Park looked like that.\u2018Me, too.I\u2019m here too.I could live here like that.\u2019Something wriggled in the child\u2019s heart.\u2018I was able to be happy!\u2019The child\u2019s eyes looked at the picture on the wall turned cold.Seojun stopped [E.L.F.\u2019s basic breathing]. And [Evil basic breathing] started. At the same time, he used another ability.[The\u00a0gloomy scent of flowers blooming alone \u2013 lowest level]Only this flower blooms at a radius of 10m.It looks similar to a grass, so no one knows it\u2019s a flower.When people smells the scent of flowers, they will feel depressed.Seojun\u2019s body exuded chilly energy.Seojun conducted many experiments after opening the door of the evil library.And he also knew that when he had enough mana in his body, he could use the skill of good and evil at the same time.He also learned that the ability to use more of the two abilities can be determined through the \u2018breathing method\u2019.[The elegant steps of Baron Cat] and [The gloomy scent of flowers blooming alone] were activated together.A cool aura flowed out of Seojun\u2019s body due to the synergy of [Evil\u2019s Basic Breathing].The child, who used to be like an angel, changed in an instant. It was different from when he was in Central Park, looking just normal.Right now, coldness was all over his body.At that moment\u2019s change, Mac, no, Evan Block\u2019s expression turned weird without realizing it.Since the script accurately stated that \u201cthe child\u2019s condition was not recognized\u201d,\u201cCut! NG!\u201dOf course, the filming stopped.At the same time, the staff and actors, who were quietly watching, without blinking they expressed admiration.They also noticed the surrounding atmosphere towards Seojun changed in an instant.\u201cWow, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard he is a genius, but this is beyond imagination.\u201dThe camera operator was also too busy to admire that eventually an assistant director of Ryan Will yelled at him.\u201cEveryone be quiet! Let\u2019s start filming again. And Evan Block!\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry!\u201dEvan Block couldn\u2019t take his eyes off from Seojun, who became ordinary again. He came to his senses at the call of Ryan Will.The more he knew, the more he couldn\u2019t know the end of Seojun\u2019s talent.When hr thought he already showed of all his talent, this actor showed more skills than him.He was now very interested at the Child\u2019s future.\u2018Maybe it won\u2019t end in just Movie Series.\u2019No other great actor has ever exceeded one Movie Series. Once they are part of a Series, they will be only remembered on that one and only character.Evan Block started preparing for the shoot with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time making NGs.\u201dSeojun felt amazing. It was not another shoot to take a bust shot or a close-up shot. It wasn\u2019t his own mistake, but it was his first time making an NG.\u201cMaybe, he was surprised because I used a different Mana?\u201dEven when everyone was returning to their seats, they couldn\u2019t take their eyes off from Seojun and were still amazed.\u201cI feel good!\u201d\u2019These people were affected from the after effects of using a breathing exercise.\u201cPeople who are going to watch the movie would also make this kind of expression, right?\u2019Seojun smiled as people\u2019s expressions came to his mind at their completely changed appearance.\u2018Good. Let\u2019s put a bit more.\u2019The filming resumed by Seojun was too excited that he brought out too much mana.\u201cNG! Jun! You put too much energy into your acting!\u201d\u201cSorry!\u201dThe staff and actors were once again surprised by Seojun\u2019s cooler atmosphere than before, but director Ryan evaluated it coldly.\u2018I can\u2019t believe my first NG in my life is because I was too enthusiastic.\u2019Seojun bit his lips and went back to filming. Evan Block tapped Seojun\u2019s shoulder to cheer him up because he couldn\u2019t stroke his set hair. Fortunately, after that, they were able to get an OK and started shooting close-up shot.The next set was an outdoor set. There were large trees and green grass.It was a set with clean running tracks and Chroma keys were installed everywhere. (TL: Chroma Keys used for visual in movies.)\u201cIt seems like they are making all these things, too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Seojun.\u201d\u201cDad, I think it\u2019s the same as Central Park.\u201dLee Min-Joon, who looked around again at Seojun\u2019s words, nodded.It was the same as Central Park, where they first took pictures and recreated the scene with this set.\u201cWhy is Chroma Key here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because they are planning to synthesize this place and the reservoir with CG. It\u2019s a waste to make another reservoir.\u201dThe two were surprised to hear sudden voices from their behind.When they turned their heads toward the voice, there was a blonde woman smiling broadly.Lee Min-Joon and Seojun welcomed the woman.\u201cHello, Rachel!\u201d\u201cAhahaha. Jun, hi\u201d.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cHello.\u201dRachel Hill waved at the two. The three sat in a prepared chair in the actor\u2019s waiting room built near the outdoor set.Seojun asked.\u201cIf the background is Central Park, can\u2019t we shoot there again?\u201d\u201cThen everything will be revealed in public. Everyone\u2019s curious if William is a hero or a villain. What if he says his line there surrounded by many people?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cCan I join?\u201dSeojun was talking to Rachel Hill, when another person intervened. It was Evan Block. The three actors and Lee Min-Joon sat in a chair and talked together.\u201cEvan, you\u2019re going to shoot a battle scene from the day after tomorrow, right? May I go and watch you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything worth seeing even if you come there. Chroma Key is the only background and counterpart. And I\u2019m not filming the battle scene. Most of them are replaced by stuntmen. Well, just get into shape in close-up shots or bust shots. Wearing tights full of sensors.\u201dEvan sighed. Everyone laughed at his appearance. He recalled Shadowman he looked liked a fool without any CG.\u201cThe Shadowman\u2019s attack is mostly CG work, so there\u2019s really nothing to watch.\u201d\u201cI still want to go!\u201d\u201cCan I go too?\u201d\u201cOkay. Shouldn\u2019t you get permission from the director rather than me?\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ll take it as a Yes!\u201dSeojun ran towards Director Ryan and asked. Directer Ryan agreed immediately.\u201cHe says it\u2019s okay!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I think the director likes Jun a lot.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201dThe three laughed at Seojun, who did not refute. Why? He really likes the director too.Lee Min-Joon took out the snacks that Seojunn brought from his bag and distributed them to the three actors.Rachel, who was smiling joyfully with a snack, opened her mouth.\u201cI heard there was a blooper. Evan, this isn\u2019t like you, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen you re-shoot it, but you\u2019re NG was still amazing.\u201d\u201cOh, that.\u201dEvan smoothed his chin. It\u2019d be nice to tell her in advance. She will film together with Seojun in a scene today.\u201cI was surprised that the atmosphere surrounding Jun changed in an instant.\u201d\u201cThe atmosphere?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain in words\u2026. You\u2019ll know when you see it. You\u2019d better be prepared.\u201dAt Evan Block\u2019s advice, Rachel Hill rolled her eyes and looked at Seojun.Seojun, who was focusing on eating the snacks his father gave him, tilted his head at Rachel Hill\u2019s gaze.Director Ryan Will came to the place where the four were sitting. The two adult actors headed to the dressing room to change, and Lee Min-Joon went to answer a phone call from Kim Hee-sung.Director Ryan Will sat in front of Seojun.\u201cToday\u2019s shoot is the most important.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201cThis scene will be a turning point.\u201dDirector Ryan Will opened his mouth with a serious look.\u201cWhether you\u2019ll be a hero or a villain. It depends on the mood you are going to express.\u201dSeojun nodded heavily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve been looking for you for a long time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBell would have known because she was following him. The child looked at Bell silently.Feeling that something strange was coming from him, Bell stared at Mac standing behind the child.Mac hurriedly shook his hands away from the child\u2019s.Then Bell found a pendant hanging on Mac\u2019s neck.Bell\u2019s eyes got bigger.That. What\u2019s wrong with that? Bell\u2019s gaze went down and headed for Mac\u2019s foot.In the end, the shadow, which had been short of patience, flinched first at her gaze. Bell\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cYou.\u201dWhen Bell tries to open her mouth,\u201cI\u2019m an adoptee.\u201dMac and Bell were surprised by the child\u2019s words and looked at the child. The child looked away from Bell and gazed at the reservoir.\u201cAll of my brothers have outstanding abilities. I was the only one who was normal.\u201dBell, who grew up with the child, was at a loss. The child turned his head and looked at Mac.His eyes were immersed in darkness.Mac\u2019s forehead frowned. He felt that something was strange. He had a strange feeling.Mac\u2019s shadow, who was pretending to be an ordinary shadow, flinched.Dangerous. Dangerous. Dangerous!\u201cMy father, who adopted me, seemed disappointed in me and didn\u2019t say a word to me. I didn\u2019t want to be left behind. I wanted to be loved by my father. So I did my best for my beloved father. But my race was different from them, so the results weren\u2019t good.\u201dOh, no, his eyes shined furiously.\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s this?\u201dMac swallowed his saliva at the child\u2019s voice. Bell was restless and signaled somewhere. The child twisted his head around.\u201cMy life has been here. Look over there.\u201dWhere he pointed with his fingers, there was a child smiling happily while holding the hands of his father and mother.It was a happy family, no matter who looked at it.\u201cI could live like that. Regardless of my ability, my parents were here to love me. You saw it earlier, right?\u201dHe smiled sarcastically. Still, his biological parents were waiting for him and loving him.It was faster for Mac to feel the aura emanating from him than to understand his words.This is!Mac could never forget this energy. Mac\u2019s shadow fluttered.\u201cBut my father ruined it.\u201d\u201cNatra!\u201dHe laughed at Mac\u2019s voice. Bell was surprised and grabbed the child\u2019s shoulder. How did he know?However, Bell couldn\u2019t talk due to the child\u2019s disappointed voice. Bell\u2019s hand trembled.\u201cRight, it\u2019s Natra.\u201dSeojun moved.[The gloomy scent of flowers blooming alone][Evil\u2019s Basic Breating is activated][The elegant steps of Baron Cat is Deactivated]\u201cI am Jin Natra, the son of King Natra.\u201dMalice erupted from Jin Natra\u2019s body. Mac stepped back at the cold energy that seemed to eat himself.Bell let go of Jin Natra\u2019s shoulders unconsciously.Upon touching the energy, the people around him collapsed.Jin Natra crossed his head without even seeing Bell, who was looking around.There was a man who remained standing even after receiving this energy, it was a man with a swaying shadow.\u201cI know who you are.\u201d\u201cOh, my! What are you doing?\u201dMac shouted at the sight of the fallen people.He remembered the sight from a year ago. Buildings were collapsing due to the attack of the Natra ship. People were bleeding and falling down. And also the woman who cried after losing her son.It was a memory engraved on his heart like his deepest trauma. He clenched my fist to the point of bleeding. His shadow moved as if it was his response.Jin Natra, who saw it, smiled and continued to talk.\u201cMac. No, Shadowman.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u2018Is that the guy who blocked us 5 years ago? But that pendant\u2026\u2026 That shadow\u2026\u2026!\u2019Mac looked at Jin Natra with blank eyes. Jin Natra\u2019s face, the face of a 10-year-old child who still need to grow up with his mother\u2019s and father\u2019s love, was nowhere to be seen.\u201cIf you had to defeated Natra\u2026\u201dA child who lost his happy daily life with his mother and father shed tears. It flowed down along his cheek.\u201cYou could have saved me.\u201d\u201cCut! Okay!\u201dDirector Ryan shouted. But no one could move. They just stared at Seojun blankly.At the memorial hall, they were surprised by the sudden change of atmosphere. They thought it was his greatest acting. But it wasn\u2019t. More of his talent were unfolded here.Seojun quickly released his evil skills and activated E.L.F.\u2019s basic breathing. Then, he clenched his right hand.[Angel\u2019s charming wings \u2013 Low-grade]His chilly aura immediately become warm.The warm wind blowing from Seojun\u2019s hand woke some people who were in depressed state after smelling his ability and also those who were watching with their soul came to their senses.When the Mana felt by the people disappeared, Seojun deactivated his ability and sighed.The skill was too difficult to use. Aside from finding the right ability, it was also difficult to fix after using it.\u2018I\u2019m glad I found a good ability.\u2019If he had Angel\u2019s charming wings as a small life creature, he would have been able to use its lowest skill.[Thegloomy scent of flowers blooming alone] It was also an ability that uses scent as a medium, so it would not have much an effect on moviegoers.\u2018But that \u2018mood\u2019 still remains.\u2019Wasn\u2019t that the same for the video that Ryan Will watched? It was enough for the Director to take a flight from the U.S. to Korea right away.As Seojun was checking the amount of Mana he used, Jonathan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cLet\u2019s get ready for the next shoot!\u201dEveryone who heard the voice returned to their position.Seojun wiped away the tears he shed and headed to fix his makeup. Rachel sobbed and collapsed on the floor.Sweeping over the golden hair shining under the sun, she spoke with a sullen face.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t hear you, I would have made a blooper. If I made an NG while acting like that, I think I would have been nagged by the director for a long time.\u201dEvan Block, who sat in front of her, laughed at Richel\u2019s words. It could be seen that when she let go of Seojun\u2019s shoulder was not acting, but her own actions.\u201cI was about to mess up my acting too.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you experience it at least once?\u201dEvan Block smoothed his back neck. The sunlight was so strong that his back neck still felt some cold and he couldn\u2019t forget the sweat flowing behind his back.\u201cHis eyes were different. In the memorial hall, he wasn\u2019t just looking into my eyes. I felt he could see through my soul.\u201dEvan Block recalled Seojun\u2019s black eyes. His eyes, which seemed nice, turned into pain and eventually into resentment. He almost missed the line due to the obvious change. How did the atmosphere change to match those eyes?\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dEvan Block looked at the place where he was standing earlier during the shoot. The smell seemed to remain at the end of his nose.With a soggy scent flowing from somewhere, he felt gloomy for a moment.The feelings that Jin Natra was feeling hit Evan Block.Sadness, resentment, depression, distress.\u2018If I take a step back, I\u2019ll be eaten.\u2019Evan Block, who thought so, turned the depression into feelings from Mac\u2019s trauma.It wasn\u2019t easy, but at least he tried to look like that on the outside. It was the first time he acted so spontaneously without a plan. It felt different from usual.\u201cIt\u2019s okay now that the smell is gone\u2026\u201d\u2018Was that smell an illusion?\u2019Thinking about what analysis he would write in Seojun Lee\u2019s notebook, Evan Block eventually gave himself a dejected smile.\u201cReally. He is like a new actor every time I see him.\u201d\u201cIs it there any difference?\u201d\u201cWhen you take a close-up shot, it\u2019ll be crazy.\u201dAfter some make-up retouch, the actors were called again to shot the Close-ups shots.First of all, James Landon, the camera director who was filming the face of Seojun, was speechless.Ryan Will was watching the monitor screen so he wasn\u2019t affected much. But he was there in front row, seeing the best of acting from Seojun. He couldn\u2019t believe that such a small child possess such a monstrous Acting talent.Those who were overwhelmed by the resentment poured from the child\u2019s body, as well as the eyes of his eyes turning like gradations, were still mesmerized.They couldn\u2019t breathe comfortably because of the damp scent and depression that tied their ankles. The gloomy smell blocked their nose, preventing them from breathing right.\u2018Breathing? How do you breathe? Is this how you Breathe?\u2019Unlike those who fell into Jin Natra\u2019s emotions, Seojun thought about it differently.When the sound of the cut did not come out while he was acting hard, he released his ability and stirred his right hand to prepare to activate the Angel\u2019s charming wings.After finishing all his work, he stood still and enjoyed the sunshine. The sun was nice. It was not too cold, not too hot. It was a warm Sun.Director Ryan Will, who was the first to come to his senses after the soggy scent disappeared, shouted.\u201cCut! OK!\u201dOnly then did everyone come to their senses and rub their arms. Wow, that\u2019s amazing. They had never seen anything like that before. Everyone looked at Seojun Lee standing with surprised eyes.\u201cIf you look at him now, he is not that different from other kids\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s tall.\u201d\u201cHandsome.\u201d\u201cMore than anything, his acting is amazing.\u201dThe staff nodded. Seojun headed in front of the monitor due to Ryan Will\u2019s gesture. Seojun\u2019s face appeared on a large monitor. It was the part where he change his facial expression, and Seojun exclaimed.\u201cI\u2019m really good.\u201d\u201cYeah. You are really good.\u201dDirector Ryan Will stroked Seojun\u2019s hair roughly. And Evan Block and Rachel Hill also stroked Seojun\u2019s head till it became a magpie\u2019s nest. Seojun laughed so hard.Jonathan, who checked the schedule in his hand, shouted.\u201cToday\u2019s shoot is over. Great job, everyone!\u201dLee Min-Joon didn\u2019t see the monitor because he was a little far away. He smiled broadly at the sound and called Seojun.\u201cSeojun, your mom is on the phone call!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dSeojun smiled brightly and ran towards his father.James Landon, who had not been able to find Jin Natra, who had been vented with malice all over his body a while ago, said with a smile.\u201cI can see why you waited for 8 months.\u201dEight moths ago he was surprised by Jonathan\u2019s call that director Ryan will delay the filming in order to train the Child Actor.\u201cIf you miss an actor like that, you can\u2019t be a director.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can I take a picture?\u201dLee Min-Joon and Seojun admired the appearance of the flashing black spaceship.The back was an empty structure, but the front was the real Natra spaceship they saw in Shadowman 1.Jonathan, who heard Lee Min-Joon, smiled and said.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. This will be displayed at the Marine Museum after we film Shadowman 2. Even if it looks like that, the outside is well done, but the inside is empty. There would be\u00a0 a separate set when filming the inside of the spaceship.\u201d\u201cReally? Seojun, take a picture, and let\u2019s brag about it to your mom and uncle later.\u201dJonathan photographed the two smiling people leaning against the black spaceship.Evan Block and Rachel Hill, who appeared on the set after finishing their makeup, also took pictures together.In the meantime, the staff also finished preparing for the shoot. The camera started rolling in the set and everyone returned to their seats. Director Ryan sat in front of the monitor.\u201cReady.\u201d[The gloomy scent of flowers blooming alone]Seojun breathed slowly. Everyone looked at the actors with a nervous look.\u201cAction!\u201dBell and Mac couldn\u2019t say anything. Only then did Mac returned to his senses at Jin Natra\u2019s words.He got goosebumps from the tip of his toes.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Mac said as if throwing up with his trembling mouth while mumbling.\u201cWhat does that have to do with me now?\u201d Jin Natra said with a cold look.\u201cWhy?\u201d Mac asked. He thought about the same woman who collapsed and cried came when his son disappeared from the blackhole.Smelling damp scent rose from somewhere. Mac cried out without realizing it.\u201cYour parents are still waiting for you! If you were alive like this, shouldn\u2019t you return to their arms right away?\u201d\u201cWith this body?\u201dJin Natra pointed at himself with his finger.Mac, who was about to shout, said, \u201cWhat does that have to do with it?\u201dThe child looks like he is already 10 years old. It was only a year ago that Natra\u2019s abnormal wormhole occurred.\u00a0 The child back then was only four years old and could have not grown immediately like that.\u201cHow\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because the time between Natra and Earth is different.\u201dBell intervened between the two. Bell, who had no idea what to do, grabbed Jin Natra\u2019s shoulder. Even the other Natra\u2019s, who was led by Bell, turned away.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes.\u201dTwo people headed towards the spaceship. The door of the spaceship slowly came down and touched the ground. And from it, Natra\u2019s soldiers in armor rushed out.\u201cWait!\u201dMac shouted. The two people on their way to the spaceship stopped. Bell turned her head toward Mac.\u201c\u2026Understand, they might understand. They love you so much!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dJin Natra looked at the wide open spaceship and then at the sky. It was blinding.He looked into the spaceship with slightly watery eyes and never looked back.Mac shouted desperately.\u201cCome back! William!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Jin natra.\u201dAnd the door of the spaceship was now closed.\u201cCut! Okay!\u201d* * *\u201cStuntman!\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes were sparkling. Evan Block and his stuntman stood side by side in front of Seojun.\u201cThey really looked the same.\u201dNot only the same height, but also the silhouette of the body was similar. Both were dressed as Shadowmen, so it really seemed that there were two Shadowmen. (TL: Like other superheroes, Shadowman has a mask. Think of him as Batman.)Filming of the battle scene began. The hero\u2019s battle was the most spectacular and important scene in any Marine Movie.Most of the budget and the bast technology are poured on the Battle Scene.Even the shooting days were also the longest.Director Ryan Will and the stuntmen began filming. They were more nervous than ever, the staff worked hard and did their job right.Seojun and Rachel Hill, who came to watch, occasionally appeared in battle scenes and sat together with Evan Block, who needed to say his lines.It wasn\u2019t as colorful as it was seen in the movie, but the combination of stuntmen was so good that it was still very exciting.\u201cI want to try it!\u201dSeojun stretched his fist along the Shadowman. Evan Block and Rachel Hill burst into laughter at his short arm.\u201cWe\u2019d better not shoot dangerous scenes if we can.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cDo you know why the release of Redborn 2 was delayed?\u201d\u201cThe Redborn actor got hurt.\u201dEvan Block and Rachel Hill nodded.\u201cIt may be okay when there is an actor to replace, but actors who will appear in a series like us should be careful towards their bodies above all else. What the audience likes is the role we play, and how disappointed would they be if another actor appears and substitute us?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dSeojun watched the stuntmen with disappointment.Shadowman treated the enemy lightly and pretended to throw something. After CG work, the Shadowman\u2019s hand would have to be covered by a shadowy Aura.Evan Block stood up from his seat. It was because he saw Jonathan, who came towards them to convey Ryan\u2019s words.\u201cIf it\u2019s not a dangerous scene, you can shoot as much as you want.Evan Block followed Jonathan towards the film set and switched seats with his stuntman.The shooting began again. Seojun, who was watching the battle scene, tilted his head and asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a dangerous scene?\u201dEvan Block ran around and joined forces with the enemy stuntmen.Obviously, it didn\u2019t look as colorful as the scene just now, but there was still an action that seemed would have seriously hurt him if he did something wrong.\u201cEvan has been practicing Martial Arts since a long time ago. I learned various martial arts. Now, he is better than most stuntmen. In addition, he also knows how to shoot as safely as possible. Look at him.\u201dAs Rachel Hill said, Evan Block checked the floor to see if there was anything to hurt his body, talked enough with the stuntmen who would play the opponent, and worked together lightly.\u201cIf someone makes a mistake like that, it\u2019s going to be a big trouble. In fact, Evan will want to be on the scene. He wants to act perfectly from start to finish. But if there\u2019s a big accident, it would hurt everyone here, so he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dSeojun watched the staff working hard.The stuntmen who are moving their bodies diligently. Actors. Makeup artists and staff who will work on CG. Many people were working hard for this movie.\u201cJun, if you want to participate other movies, at least learn some Martial Arts. If learn Martial Arts from now on, you will be able to participate in more action scenes than Evan.\u201dSeojun nodded.\u2018When I go back to Korea, I\u2019ll enroll in a Taekwondo Dojo right away!\u2019* * *From the scheduled shoot to the additional shoot. Shadowman 2\u2019s filming did not end yet, but Seojun\u2019s shooting are now over.On the last day of filming, a public relations staff of Marine asked if they would attend the preview here in the United States. Seojun shook his head when he heard the date of the premiere.\u201cThank you Everyone for taking care of me during the shooting!\u201d\u201cJun, take care. Call me when you come back to America!\u201d\u201cThis is my phone number and email address. Call me even if everything is okay.\u201d\u201cOh, me too!\u201dWhen Evan Block wrote his contacts on a paper he took from his notebook, he handed it to Seojun. Rachel Hill quickly found a paper and wrote down her e-mail address.Seojun, who received the two papers, smiled brightly.\u201cBe careful when you shoot, because the battle scene is dangerous.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I am very strong even if I look like this.\u201d\u201cLet me know when you film another movie or drama next time. I\u2019ll definitely watch it.\u201dThe three actors, who had been together throughout the filming period, will now be parting their ways.Evan Block and Rachel Hill left the hotel after it was time for Seojun to sleep.\u201cDad.\u201d\u201cWhat it it son?\u201dSeojun lied down on his side to prevent himself from hibernating with his ability. From filming at Central Park to filming at the set. He remembered the time he spent in the United States.He also hung out with his dad when he had time.\u201cI had so much fun. It would have been nice if my mom came too.\u201d\u201cI know. When Seojun starts attending school and summer vacation comes, let\u2019s come back with your mom.\u201dLee Min-Joon was lying face to face at his son\u2019s expression full of satisfaction and joy.\u201cYes, I want to film again.\u201d\u201cYou really enjoyed yourself, huh? Do you want to act again?\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019m going to ask Uncle Chan if he has a good script\u201d.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s ask him when we come back in Korea.\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes slowly closed.\u201cTomorrow, I have to play with Jack\u2026\u201dLee Min-Joon covered his sleeping son\u2019s blanket well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was older than him by a year but he taller than him now. He burst into tears when his parents said to him \u2018It\u2019s because you don\u2019t eat much!\u2019After his mom and dad scolded he fell on the floor and wailed.But soon, he forgot why he cried.Jack and Seojun had fun at a nearby amusement park.After returning to Korea, Seojun began attending Taekwondo classes.The master, who saw Seojun register at the Taekwondo Dojo closest to his home, tilted his head.He seemed familiar but couldn\u2019t recognize who he was because he was not very interested in movies.Adult, middle and high school students had different times of practice so there weren\u2019t many noise about how a Hollywood actor enrolled in a Local Dojo.Seojun\u2019s kindergarten friends also registered to take some Taekwondo Lessons like Seojun.\u201cI learned this today!\u201dSeojun punched in the air.Punch!Punch! Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon kept smiling at Seojun\u2019s face full of spirit.\u201cWhat do you think? I\u2019m so good at this!\u201d\u201cSeojun is the best!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really good! You can be a Taekwondo Athlete!\u201dAnd that actually happened.\u201cLet\u2019s Seojun do it! Seojun\u2019s mother!\u201dIn just less than two weeks, the taekwondo instructor wanted Seojun to be trained professionally.On the wall of the small counseling room there were medals won by many Taekwondo Players at the National Sports Festival attached.\u201cTraining..?\u201d\u201cSeojun is really good. He\u2019s really good! He learn the movements I taught him only at once.\u201d\u201cSeojun is kind of smart.\u201dThe master shook his head.\u201cHe is not just a little smart! Power and agility Even though he is young he has the body perfect to become a Taekwondo Player!\u201d.Seojun gulped down the orange juice given by the master.[Hwang Clan\u2019 Pet Dog of the Youngest Child]You can see the flow of martial arts very little.Hwang martial arts can be reenacted.Limitation: Dog.Seojun lived as a pet dog of the youngest son for 10 years.He followed thee youngest son around and walked around the Hwang compound, and from some point on, he was able to go to places where the youngest son\u2019s authority really worked.Who dares to treat badly the only pet dog of the youngest son loved by the Patriarch?The most interesting thing to do in the boring Hwang Compound was to get snacks near the kitchen, and the second was to rip off snacks in front of the training time of the Martial Artist.Most of them were angry at the Dog, but they couldn\u2019t do anything at the youngest young Prince\u2019s pet dog.And on such days, the youngest young son gave them something delicious as a form sorry by how his Dog acted. In other words, the people training were looking forward at the arrival of the Dog in order to expect an extravagant meal after.His life ended when the youngest son became 15 years old.There was a raid.Seojun knew only after looking at the book what happened after his death. The enemy was a Wizard, and Hwang Clan struggled to survive.The dog, who blocked the enemies with Hwang\u2019s martial arts learned with his eyes, saved its owner and died.The youngest son, whose brothers were all dead, was now a cow owner, ordered his son to be buried next to the grave of the Dog who saved him.\u2018If I was not a dog, I can\u2019t use Hwang\u2019s martial arts.\u2019Even though he can\u2019t use the Martial Arts, he could still study it by seeing how it was done.Seojun, who used his ability, was able to take a more accurate posture than from the Instructor who demonstrated the move.He replied the Instructor, who was trying to persuade him, \u201cI am still young and I have no intention of doing so.\u201dLeaving the teacher behind, Seo Eun-Hye and Seojun left the Dojo.\u201cI thought you were good, but I didn\u2019t know you were so great that the Instructor wanted to recruit you for National Competitions.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so good at this!\u201dIt was Taekwondo that he learned with his keen eyes from a group martial artists. What the Instructor taught him was very easy to learn.Seo Eun-Hye peeked at his son\u2019s confident face.\u201cSure. Seojun, do you want to be a Taekwondo athlete?\u201d\u201cNo! No! No!\u201dSeo Eun-Hye eventually burst into laughter at the sight of her son shaking his head to refuse the proposal at once.\u201cWhen I\u2019m done learning Taekwondo, I\u2019m going to learn kendo next time! I want to learn hapkido, too!\u201cThen your mom should hurry up and find many more Martial Arts Schools.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye, would have never imagined that she would be held in her pants by Instructor who are begging her to train Seojun Professionally, saying that it was only a matter of time before he became an Olympic gold medalist.After the year passed, Seojun turned 8 years old. (TL: Korea has a tradition to add a year in their age after New Year also after their birth because they count the time when the baby was in the womb of the mother so in international age Seojun is 6 years old.)After a long Lunar New Year holiday, the promotion of Shadowman 2 began.The scene of Redborn 2\u2019s Advertisement video was on television together with another clip of Seojun and Evan Block smiling brightly in the Central Park.In addition, the scene of Evan Block fighting and the appearance of ther blonde woman was also in the advertisement.Topic: RACHEL Hill!

He\u2019s a hero!\u2013 Can\u2019t you tell when they promote like that? He\u2019s a villain!\u2013 But if he is a villain, we won\u2019t be able to empathize with him. I keep thinking of him as angel.The Internet was full of opinions, but most expected Seojun to be a hero at the ratio of Hero 9 to Villain 1.At the same time, everyone did not hide their expectations for Shadowman 2.Unlike the noisy Internet, Seojun\u2019s family was very peaceful.\u201cSeojun, isn\u2019t this okay? It\u2019s light and it doesn\u2019t get dirty easily.\u201dLee Min-Joon held a navy school bag.The strap fits well with his shoulder, and the weight is light. When Seojun nodded, Seo Eun-Hye, who was next to him, lifted also the sky blue backpack she was holding.\u201cHow about this? It\u2019s refreshing and nice to see.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dSeojun also wore the sky blue bag.Seojun didn\u2019t know what to choose between the two but he like more the manly color of the Navy Blue Bag.Lee Min-Joon put the navy blue bag in his cart singing \u201cHurray\u201d, while Seo Eun-Hye put the sky blue bag back on the display case with a disappointed face.\u201cNext is pencil case and pencil. We need to also buy erasers and notebooks.\u201dThe big mart was full of families who brought their children. Everyone was putting school bags, writing utensils, and notebooks in their carts.That\u2019s right. Next month would be March. (Like Japan, Korea start school in spring.)It would be the beginning of a new semester and a month full of excitement for children.Lee Seojun, who turned eight, would now be attending a nearby elementary school.\u201cUncle Heesung decided to make a pencil case for me.\u201dSeojun, who was looking around the display of many pencil case, suddenly said.\u201cIt would be my school entrance gift! He would also make me a lot of dolls that I could attached to my bag.\u201dThe couple shook their heads as they headed to the stationery section.\u201cDo you need to buy anything at the Stationery?\u201d\u201cThen, I just need to buy a notebook.\u201dSeojun chose a notebook on the cover he liked and was now ready to enter elementary school.That night, Kim Hee-sung appeared at their home and handed Seojun a box.\u201cThe basic item is this slime pencil case. There are five different colors. There is the werewolf wolf version pencil case. There\u2019s also a bear version, too.\u201d\u201cUncle. How about a Giant worm?\u201dSeo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon, who were eating oranges, coughed at Seojun\u2019s words.\u2018If it\u2019s a giant worm, that big worm?\u2019\u2018He is going to make that into a pencil case?\u2019They were now comfortable at their son\u2019s weird taste but a giant worm was a little bit too much\u2026\u201cI failed because the planning team and the design team all said no.\u201dIn Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon\u2019s head, they remembered the planning team and design team employees who would usually say their thought without any reservation in front of their president due to his weird tastes.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. It would look really good on you.\u201dNow, it was Seojun and Kim Hee-Sung who compromised with reality.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is he a model?\u2019 Many people were whispering these words as Seojun pass by them.In response, the couple and Seojun breathed a sigh of relief. Praising Seojun beauty means that they didn\u2019t recognize him as the Hollywood Child actor.The ceremony in the auditorium ended simply to match the short concentration of the children.Seojun\u2019s section is class 2 of Grade 1.Outside the room, parents were standing in front of the windows to watch their children. Meanwhile, their children were sitting on their desks with their names on them.(TL: Korean School often has lower grade rooms on the first floor so parents can see them through the window.)\u201cSeojun! Your sit is here!\u201d\u201cHere, here.\u201dAs Seojun was looking where his name was written, there were already other children calling for him.\u201cHi. Mina. Hi, Jiyoon.\u201d\u201cHi. Seojun!\u201d\u201cJIHOO and JIHO are also in our class.\u201d (TL: the pronunciations are Jihoo=Jihu, Jiho=Jiho)Luckily, all the friends he made when he was a baby were also here. Also, it seems that their sitting arrangement is near to each other.As Seojun was talking excitedly with his friends, where the topic of their conversation was his unicorn doll attached to his backpack, suddenly the door opened, and the homeroom teacher came in.The homeroom teacher called each students\u2019 name and let them introduce themselves. After some time, the school hours are already finished.\u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d\u201cYes! Teacher!\u201dAfter bidding goodbye to his teacher and friends, the first day of school is now over.Seojun headed to his grandfather\u2019s house as he held his mother and father\u2019s hands.His grandparents and parents decided to gather together and celebrate Seojun\u2019s first day of school.His mom and dad stopped by a cell phone store on their way to his grandfather\u2019s house and bought a smartphone for Seojun.Kim Hee-Sung even prepared a cell phone case with several monsters on it as a surprise gift. Now it has become a perfect cell phone for Seojun.While registering the phone numbers of acquaintances, the couple said to Seojun.\u201cYou have to answer my call. And do not let your parents worry about you. Call us if you feel something dangerous happens. If we don\u2019t pick up, call your grandparents or your uncles. I even registered Brown Black\u2019s phone numbers.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI even installed KakaoTalk. Should I try to send a message?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d\u2018My smartphone!\u2019Seojun awkwardly grabbed his cell phone and sent a message.There are as many KakaoTalk chat heads as he got many friends on Kakao.He sent messages each in either Korean and English.<Hello, I\u2019m Lee SeojunI bought a smartphone!This is my phone number! Please register it please.\u3147\u3145\u3147\u00a0\u00a0>\u201cI was thinking about whether to do an English or Korean one. Anyway, I did both!\u201d* * *\u201cMy grandson is already going to school!\u201d\u201cThis is your grandfather\u2019s present.\u201d\u201cThis is your grandmother\u2019s present.\u201dSeojun smiled brightly while hugging the gift boxes. His grandfather whispered. \u2018I\u2019ll give you a separate birthday present later.\u2019When he returned home after eating a lot of delicious food from his grandparents, there were congratulatory messages from many of his acquaintances.\u201cNara told Jonathan, Jonathan told Ryan, and everyone got to know, right?\u201d\u201cWhen did Nara get close to Jonathan?\u201dSeo Eun-Hye shook her head.\u201cEveryone sent me a birthday gift and Fist day of school gift.\u201d\u201cOhh. We would be expecting a lot of packages in these few days.\u201dLike Lee Min-Joon\u2019s assumption, gifts arrived from American acquaintances, Brown Black, through Cocoa Entertainment, and gifts from Lee Ji-Seok and Choi Dae-man arrived.Seojun looked up at their living room full of Gift Boxes.\u201cAll of them are mine?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Seojun\u2019s.\u201dThe couple thanked them for the gifts piled up in the living room, but they sighed on their own. In particular, the presents of Nara and Kevin were the scariest.\u201cYou should also add Rachel\u2019s gift on that category.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dKevin and Nara sent professional violins and guitars. The Hollywood actor Rachel Hill sent an expensive electronic piano while Evan sent books related to movies.Each person\u2019s gift showed their individuality.\u201cWill you learn how to play an instrument? Violin and guitar are quite difficult, but I think it would be okay to learn piano by watching some videos.\u201d\u201cOr you can attend some classes.\u201d\u201cHmm. I\u2019ll think about it!\u201dSeojun\u2019s fan cafe decided to donate instead of sending birthday gifts to Seojun.Lee Min-Joon and his wife posted a \u2018thank-you message on his fan cafe, and everyone replied that they were looking forward to Shadowman 2.* * *It was still cold. However, the breezy wind of spring is now approaching.It is already mid-March, and Shadowman 2 is now released.\u201cThe poster is cool.\u201dKim Hee-sung saw a poster posted on the wall.Seojun\u2019s mom and dad are spending some alone time together. Kim Hee-sang decided to take charge of babysitting Seojun.A poster of Shadowman 2 was posted on the wall, with the main character facing elsewhere.\u201cSeojun, how was the present?\u201d\u201cVampire badge! My friends were really jealous.\u201d\u201cI was interested in metal crafting this time, so I made it. I heard that the red eyes were quite scary\u201d.\u201cMy friends said that it was scary, but it was still cool to see it sparkle.\u201dKim Hee-sung and Seojun were whispering to each other as they were here in the movie theater lining up to watch Shadowman 2.\u201cIf they find out Seojun is here, it\u2019ll become a mess.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201dSeojun and Kim Hee-sung sat in an empty seat.They were quite early before Shadowman 2 starts. Seojun wanted to hear people\u2019s opinion so begged Kim Hee-sung to arrive early.\u201cAs expected, he\u2019s a hero! They say that he was with Evan Block sightseeing.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s weird because they filmed it so openly. Is he being a villain a surprise?\u201d\u201cEven if William is a villain, what\u2019s the point of filming with Shadowman in a friendly way?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u2026.\u201dEveryone was curious about William\u2019s position.\u201cI am more curious about why William, who was sucked into the wormhole, was on Earth than that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. What happened to him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious about why.\u201dSoon, the door of the theater opened. The staff began to guide the next audience.\u201cThe 4th Hall! If you want to watch Shadowman 2, please come in!\u201dSeojun and Kim Hee-sung joined hands and headed inside the theater.Park Sung-won followed the two.His small height was also noticeable among many visitors.\u2018Even a child like this is coming to watch the movie. But, I think I\u2019ve seen him from somewhere.\u2019However, when people sat in their reserved seats, all their thoughts disappeared.It was because Shadowman 2, which they had been waiting for nearly two years, finally started. The audience\u2019s hearts were pounding.After the advertisement, the theater became darker. Park Sung-won waited for Marine\u2019s logo to come out.Even if it was only the logo, they were already excited about the movie.However, the colorful logo that Park Sung-won expected did not come out, and the screen turned black.And music came out from the speakers throughout the movie theater.It was heavy and depressing music that seemed to hit their heart.Later, it was the music to be used as an OST for Jin Natra.The black screen brightened, and black shadows moved. It clumped and fell and moved actively like a black flame.They heard a laugh. The sound filled the movie theater.Park Sung-won swallowed his saliva.\u2018What? Did they play the wrong movie?\u2019[Mom, dad\u2026\u2026.]And they heard the child\u2019s sobbing voice. They don\u2019t even have time to guess whose voice it was.Doong!Doong! doong!Marine\u2019s logo appeared.Mac\u2019s part-time job today was to be a tourist guide around Central Park. Thanks to diligent tourists, Mac, who had been guiding from the morning, met a child.A voice was heard from somewhere in the movie theater, \u201cLee Seojun!\u201d Despite such noise, Park Sung-won focused on the screen.The child, who seemed shy, had a mature and soft appearance. Park Sung-won recalled a picture of an angel smiling brightly from that appearance.A smile came to his face. As expected, he is a hero!It was time for his part-time job to end, and Mac decided to accompany the child throughout Central Park because it would be boring if the child stayed at the Center for a long time.The two entered an exhibition hall after looking around the baseball stadiums, zoos, and art galleries.[Memorial Hall]When the subtitle came out, the audience held their breath.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This [Memorial Hall] was for those people who disappeared into the wormhole.\u201cGasp.\u201dSomeone made a sound without realizing it, but no one cared.This was because they thought that they couldn\u2019t resist themselves from making sound at the shocking discovery.Park Sung-Won also covered his mouth and only looked at the screen.William was there. Mac tilted his head and alternately looked between the picture and the child he was with.In the scene where the child realizes who was the one in the picture, Park Sung-Won and the audience feel chill.They wondered how he would become a hero a while ago, but now it didn\u2019t feel right.The feeling they felt from William was not what a hero has.Park Sung-Won wanted to reject that fact in his heart.\u2018No, that can\u2019t be true. He was so nice.\u2026 and I recalled the god from The Devil. He seems to be very different now. In a little bit\u2026\u2026. he may be a hero.\u2019Then, Bell appeared, and the story of Jin Natra, the child, was revealed.Only then did Park Sung-Won, who thought of the scene that first appeared before the logo, open his mouth.The child\u2019s aura changed in an instant.From his parents who lost him, the hero who failed to protect him, and his beloved adopted father, who has been the cause of the painful separation from his birth parents\u2026The child, who was kind by nature, could not endure the pain and betrayal.\u201cIf you had to defeated Natra\u2026\u201dThe child who lost his happy daily life with his mother and father shed tears. It flowed down along his cheek.\u201cYou could have saved me.\u201dPark Sung-Won, who couldn\u2019t give up at the thought he was a hero until the end, understood it at that moment.He felt malice in the eyes of Jin Natra. He felt small but clear malice coming from the very kind William.Mac shouted.\u201cCome back! William!\u201dIn everyone\u2019s head, they remembered William smiling brightly, the crying child shaman, and the angel who descended like a blessing, but when Jin Natra\u2019s face was zoomed in, they completely forgot about those good characters.All the audience was captivated by the cold expression and made their spine froze at the chilling aura emitted from the child.\u201cI\u2019m Jin natra.\u201dJin Natra left Mac behind and boarded the spaceship.The spaceship\u2019s door was now firmly closed. At the same time, many other spaceships appeared in the sky.They were spaceships coming from Natra. Bell, who boarded Jin\u2019s spaceship with Jin, shouted.\u201cThose guys! I can\u2019t believe they followed us all the way here!\u201dThe other candidates giggling came to Bell\u2019s mind. They hated Jin Natra, and it seemed that they had decided to get rid of him.The other candidate\u2019s spaceship opened and attacked Central Park, where Jin Natra was located.The door opened, and the candidates\u2019 soldiers fell onto the ground.Amidst the mess, Bell recalled what had happened five years ago.\u201cI need to go and help. Jin. What do you want to do?\u201dBell, who became indecisive, asked, but Jin Natra only looked silently at the battle scene between the Shadowman and the other spaceships on the screen.After that, citizens who went on a picnic were seen crying and bleeding while evacuating.Leaving without hesitation, Bell Natra ran to where her soldiers were. And the battle began. The battle went on without a break.At that time, other people stood out. It was a child who happily held hands with his parent for an outing.The child was crying alone in the war. Perhaps it was because he missed his mother and father.Jin Natra\u2019s eyes shook.Natra\u2019s spaceship was now falling over the child. Jin jumped up from his seat without realizing it.The Audience noticed that this was the last chance. The last chance for Jin Natra to become a hero. Everyone clenched their hands tightly.Go back! Go back!Save the child!Someone saw Jin Natra running. It was a shadow man. Jin Natra saved the child under the falling spaceship after Shadowman beat all the enemies.The child returned safely in between the arms of his mother and father. There were tear marks on the dusty face, but the child smiled brightly in the arms of his mother and father.Jin Natra, who couldn\u2019t take his eyes off toward the touching scene, covered his face with both hands.Everyone was speechless by the malice emitted from his back.\u201cWhy did I saved him?\u201dWhy?Jin Natra bit his lips. A drop of dark red blood fell to the floor.The audience held their breath.Here, a new Villain was born from sadness.None of the audience had time to think of the angel Lee Seojun. They didn\u2019t think of anything. They just focused on the screen.\u2018Why?\u2019\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you save me?\u201dPark Sung-Won got goosebumps at Jin Natra\u2019s cold eyes. Lee Seojun\u2019s image, which seemed like an angel before they knew it, is now a Villain.The child, unable to handle too much pain, began to vent his resentment out.Jin went into his room. There was a teddy bear on the table. The audience recalled the same scene from the last video on Redborn. The teddy bear, after five years since Natra\u2019s time, is now very old.\u201cWilliam?\u201dBell, who finished the battle, returned. She was full of wounds, but she still had a bright face.\u201cIsn\u2019t that doll named William? The earlier man also looked at you and called you William.\u2026. Your name must have been William before you lost your memory.\u201dJin Natra looked at the teddy bear without saying much.Shadowman stood at the center of the ruined Central Park. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the spaceship William was on.\u201cWhy. Why did this happen?\u201dThe broken mask fell to the floor. They could see Mac\u2019s confused face.The movie is now finished.\u201cOh my\u2026\u201dEveryone was exhausted and couldn\u2019t move from their seat even though the lights were now on.They came to watch a movie of Battle and action, but surprisingly, their emotions were drained due to a single movie. It didn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t like it. They couldn\u2019t take their eyes off the screen for a single moment.Park Sung-Won moved around to relax his tensed muscle. The audience got up from the chair with their things.\u201cVideo\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWill there be a video at the end?\u201dSomeone\u2019s words rang in the whole quiet theater. Those who were pulling themselves together and organizing their things sat calmly back in their chairs again.What kind of shocking video will we appear this time? Park Sung-Won also looked at the screen with expectations.The white letters slowly climbed up. And soon, the screen changed as everyone expected.[What do you think? Isn\u2019t it hard to do it all alone?]Redborn reached out his hand. After a while, the black gloves held the hand. The audience can\u2019t forget the outfit they just saw! The audience\u2019s mouth opened on its own.[Nice to meet you, Shadowman!]A confident Redborn and a tired-faced Shadowman stood facing each other.\u201cWhat?!\u201dIt was a preview of [Assemble], where Marine\u2019s superheroes all gathered.Park Sung-Won, who was leaving the theater, suddenly looked back.Park Sung-won was the last one to come out, and there was no one left in the theater, but he recalled the child standing back there. At that moment, he froze.\u201cLee, Seojun?!\u201dReally? Did I see it wrong? Park Sung-won, who was still in shock, ran to his home.[Title: I think I saw Lee Seojun at the movie theater]\u201cWow. Very Shocking.\u201d\u201cSeojun, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d\u201cYeah. Yeah.\u201dWhether he knew that or not, Kim Hee-sung and Seojun were leaving the movie theater leisurely.\u201cI had no idea!\u201d\u201cEven the actor didn\u2019t know, so the security was very strict.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even imagine it! Shadowman with Redborn!\u201d\u201cSeojun, no spoilers, okay?\u201d* * *\u201cHello, I am your favorite YouTuber back again with another Movie Review!\u201dHe waved at the camera. Two weeks have already passed since Shadowman 2 was released.Perhaps, because it felt like everyone had watched it, the comments were filled in an instant without even starting the review.\u201cNow Marine must have decided to shock people with Promotional videos. Wow. A movie with superheroes that I only saw in comic books will be made! So I looked upon the Internet for the title.\u201dA bright logo was posted on the monitor.[ASSEMBLE]\u201cAssemble! The title of the next movie is Assemble. The only superheroes that have already been confirmed to appear are our heroes, Redborn and Shadowman. I\u2019m looking forward to what other heroes will come out.\u201dThe assemble\u2019s logo disappeared from the screen.\u201cNext, as the title suggests, I\u2019ll talk about Shadowman 2.\u201d-You got it wrong again, right?-Oh no. Lee Seojun is a villain!The YouTuber shook his head.\u201cYes, I got it wrong again. Why are the results the opposite of everything I say? Honestly, aside from the picture of Central Park, you know this picture.\u201dHe posted a picture. It was a picture of the angel Lee Seojun.-Angel!-A 1 million won angel!-My friend also picked up 100,000 won. I thought it was a cigarette butt, so I picked it up to throw it away, but there are two 50,000 won bills inside!-I have it in my house too. I pray before it every day.\u201cI have this at home, too. The day I saw this picture, my mother won a 1 million won gift certificate. I printed it very big and hung it in a frame. And my sister put pictures of Brown Black around it. It became quite noisy because of the renewal of their contract, right?\u201dHe posted a picture of his living room. Seojun\u2019s photos and Brown Black\u2019s photos were hanging on the wall.Six years after Brown Black\u2019s debut, the renewal of Korea\u2019s best idol group is approaching. The Youtuber shrugged.\u201cWell, let\u2019s stop with the introduction. Isn\u2019t this the hero of this picture? I thought that filming Central Park was a diversion. But this picture is so powerful that I thought Seojun would be really awkward if he became a villain.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The image cut was released at Marine Museum. Seojun, in the picture, was looking somewhere with cold eyes.\u201cThis villain has such an aura! That was actor Lee Seojun. Oh, he is not a villain yet. He had never done anything bad. This invasion of the Earth was done by the bad guys who aimed at Jin Natra. But you all know, right? I feel like he is going to be an incredible villain!\u201d-Yeah, it\u2019s really scary.-It was scary but also sad.-I felt Jin\u2019s feelings so much while watching the movie that I became sad and scared for him.\u201cBut I think I\u2019d blame everyone, too. According to the official setting, there is a 5:1 difference between planet Natra and Earth time. So it\u2019s been a year since William disappeared from Earth, but it was five years ago that William fell on the planet Natra. If William was four to five years old when he disappeared, Jin Natra would be nine to ten years old.\u201d-I\u2019m sure he grew up more than William.-But I recognized that the Central Park scene was Lee Seojun. I saw many pictures of his.-What should I eat to be that big like Seojun?\u201cEveryone. Think about it.\u201dThe YouTuber stopped for a moment and moved to the other side.\u201cWilliam grew up well without his parents from that age. There were even bullies, but until he went to the memorial hall, he was just an ordinary kid who laughed and chatted with Mac.\u201d-I really thought it was a hero.-His smiling expression was that of an angel!\u201cYes, I was like that, too. But he found out that his father, whom he loved the most, was the one who put him in pain. He knew his real parents were eagerly waiting for him, and on the other hand, he knew that all the daily life in Central Park, which he envied while watching all day, was a time he could have experienced instead of a hard time. He is smart kid.\u201dMoviegoers and viewers recalled Jin Natra, who recognized at once that he was a child in the picture with just simple clues.-His expression was so sad-I almost cried there. It\u2019s sad, but I was scared of a sudden change.\u201cBut this is what I thought.\u201d-What?\u201cThink about it. Mac is a character who accidentally came to Earth from Natra, and Jin is a character who went to Natra from Earth. Mac had a lot of good people around him. He was an orphan who grew up being loved. But what about Jin? He lived unfortunately without anyone to rely on.\u201d-What about Bell-Natra? Isn\u2019t she okay?The Youtuber frowned.\u201cI won\u2019t say it because I\u2019m not sure, but Bell Natra doesn\u2019t seem to be such a good person. Anyway, Mac and Jin have a completely opposite past.\u201d-So, is it hero vs villain?\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. This movie is like a turning point between Shadowman and Jin Natra. If ther overcome this crisis well, he is a hero, and if they don\u2019t, they are a villain. The two will be divided here again.\u201dA picture of the Shadowman and Jin Natra appeared on the screen, and a picture appeared at the bottom of the shadow.\u201cA helper appeared for Shadowman!\u201d-Redborn!-Assemble!It was Redborn, smiling confidently.\u201cMAC is very lucky. On the other hand, what about Jin who went back to Natra?\u201dA large question mark appeared under Jin Natra\u2019s picture. Anyone could have expected it.Jin natra has no one to rely on, let alone a helper. And that\u2019s one of the reasons he became a villain.-\u315c\u315c\u315c\u315c-\u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160The comments were filled with tears.Everyone thought of the first scene.A cold laughing voice. And a father who made himself living an unhappy life.The Youtuber nodded.\u201cAs you all guessed, I\u2019ll stop here. I think the most important thing in this movie was actor Lee Seojun\u2019s acting. That\u2019s what happened when I watched Shadowman 2. From the scene of the memorial hall, I thought actor Lee Seojun will enter a bad path. That\u2019s how I felt, of course.\u201d-Yes, me too.-It\u2019s so serious from there!\u201cThat scene was up to actor Lee Seojun on how Jin Natra will develop. Malice blooming in sorrow. A sprout of evil that will change enormously in the future. If actor Lee Seojun was like from \u2018The Devil\u2019 with a good aura, we would have thought Jin Natra might become a hero in Shadowman 3. However, actor Lee Seojun stepped our hopes very well. He had really done a perfect acting!\u201d-No matter how much I think about it, in Shadowman 3, he will be just a villain\u2026\u2026.-No matter how it comes out, it\u2019s\u2026.-When Jin Natra saved the child my hopes went up but it went down suddenly.\u201cI hope Shadowman 3 will come out soon! Of course, I\u2019m looking forward to \u2018Assamble\u2019 too!\u201dNews started appearing here and there, after the YouTuber\u2019s live.[Acting transformation! How can he act like this at a young age?][The evil hidden in sadness, What\u2019s the secret to his success in Hollywood?[Real situation! There\u2019s a kid who grew up in his hands][How far Seojun\u2019s acting can go?][So when is Shadowman 3?][Super heroes, Assemble!]-I thought he was definitely a Hero. I still have his angel appearance in my head.-That\u2019s unfortunate. How come he came to earth?-It must be complicated. His father did something wrong, but he still love him. He don\u2019t even remember his biological parents waiting for him.-I think it\u2019s because his body grew up. He is too big to come back a year later.-But Lee Seojun is really good at acting. The Close-up shot\u2026 I thought I was really suffocating at his stare. An actor who even acts with his eyes.-I got goosebumps there, too. Scary yet sad.-While watching the movie, I got emotional with Lee Seojun and blamed the Shadowman. Why didn\u2019t he save him?-Me too! lol. I know it\u2019s not the shadowman\u2019s fault. lol-But really?-I don\u2019t think so. There are so many people in the movie theater. No matter how much you cover it, there\u2019s no way they can\u2019t recognize Lee Seojun.-I know. Even though he grew up a lot, he still looked handsome. I recognized him in the movie at a glance.-It\u2019s interesting that there aren\u2019t many sightings of Lee Seojun.\u2013 Is he in the US? No. If anyone saw him in the U.S., a picture would have been released.-Aren\u2019t people around him protecting him? Since he is still young.-That would be the case if there are nice people. But now that he will be attending in elementary school, that\u2019s going to be hard, too.\u2013 One or two people will post picture soon.-But only from those who watch movies. People who don\u2019t watch movies won\u2019t know him.-He is still on the news.-Even my mom and dad know that a Korean child actor named Lee Seojun is very popular in foreign countries, but they don\u2019t know what he looks like. But they know his picture of an angel.-There will be a lot of people like that. lol. I know he is famous but they don\u2019t know its face lol-I think he\u2019ll become famous soon if he comes out on TV.* * *\u201cMom.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cMy teeth are shaking.\u201dSeojun fiddled with his front teeth with his finger.Shake shake.Seojun ran in front of his mother and shake his front teeth.It really shook. Seo Eun-Hye, who was preparing dinner, stopped for a moment.\u201cI guess you are still a child after all.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYour Baby teeth will be taken out and soon a strong permanent tooth will come out.\u201d\u201cThis is uncomfortable. Can you take it out now, mom?\u201dSojun doesn\u2019t like it if his move so much.Seo Eun-Hye shook her head.\u201cIf you wait a little longer, it\u2019ll come out on its own.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cIt will fall down soon just wait.\u201dSeojun was uncomfortable, but he left it alone.He didn\u2019t want to care about it, but he kept shaking his front teeth with the tip of his tongue.After a few days.\u201cIt\u2019s out!\u201dHis front teeth felt empty.Seojun kept looking in the mirror.One of the front teeth fell out and it was now empty. His mom and dad were busy taking pictures, saying he was really cute.The feeling of the lips and tongue touching the empty front teeth was strange.\u201cMom, my pronunciation is weird.\u201dIn addition, his pronunciation came with a very airy one.Seo Eun-Hye thought it was cute, smiled and said.\u201cIt\u2019s because the wind went between your front teeth. If you have permanent teeth, you\u2019ll be fine again.\u201d\u201cHmm. Can you understand me?\u201d\u201cYes, It\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a relief that it fell after filming Shadow Man\u201d.\u201cWouldn\u2019t they fix it with CG?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dThe next day, when he went to elementary school without paying attention to his pronunciation anymore, most of his friends in the same class lost their teeth.Some had two front teeth missing, and others had their lower teeth missing.Everyone laughed looking at each other\u2019s faces.\u201cSeojun teeth fell too!\u201d\u201cYes, It fell yesterday!\u201d\u201cMine is the day before yesterday. You have to throw it on the roof to get new teeth.\u201dAt Ji-Yoon\u2019s words, Seojun and his friends tilted their heads. Their house is in an apartment. Everyone lived in the same apartment.\u201cWhere is the roof of the apartment building?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it the rooftop?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go into the rooftop!\u201dEveryone nodded at Seojun\u2019s words. And everyone\u2019s heads tilted again.The homeroom teacher, who was listening to the children\u2019s chatter, smiled and told them another way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seojun wrapped his missing front teeth with tissue and put them under the pillow.Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon asked.\u201cTeacher, told me about the Fairy Tooth. She said the tooth fairy will be going to give me a coin in exchange of the tooth. These days, we can\u2019t throw it on the roof, so we do this.\u201d\u201cYour teacher is so global.\u201dSeojun quickly lay on the pillow.He was going to go to the library and look for a tooth fairy. He roughly read books that had nothing to do with acting, but he forgot were it was because the number of books was too large.\u2018I think it\u2019s somewhere here! What in the world is he taking his teeth and using them for?\u2019The fourth door opened after his birthday. Now he has more books to choose from. When he thought there was such a drama or movie, he felt like he could practice acting to immerse well with the role.\u201cTooth fairy. Tooth fairy!\u201dHe searched throughout the whole library.In the Evil library.There was a fairy who stole a child\u2019s missing tooth and used it to turn into that child and lived with his family, robbing his identity.\u201cBad tooth fairy!\u201dHe jumped up, and his father held a tissue with teeth in one hand and a pocket with coins in the other. His mom was standing behind his dad.Seojun blinked at the faces of his mother and father acting like a thief caught in act.\u201c\u2026Seojun. You woke up early.\u201d\u201cThis is just a dream Seojun~\u201dMom and dad smiled awkwardly and handed Seojun the pocket with the coin.When he went to school, all his friends were holding coin pockets.Seojun squinted his eyes.Looking at the similar coin pockets, it was probably discussed by all parents.\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter!\u2019Seojun and his friends bought delicious tteokbokki at a snack bar in front of the school after classes.\u2018When will my front teeth grow? Will another tooth will come out?\u2019Seojun, who looks in the mirror once a day, contacted Lee Ji-seok.\u201cHello, Ji-seok Hyung.\u201d-Hi, Seojun. I enjoyed the movie! You were really good.\u201cHehehe. Thank you. Thank you for the birthday present.\u201dLee Ji-seok gifted Seojun old movies and scripts for Seojun\u2019s first day of school and birthday.Seojun and his parents enjoyed watching them.-I\u2019m glad you had fun. Seojun, what are you doing these days?\u201cI am attending a Taekwondo class on Mondays and Wednesdays after school. I go to a music academy on Tuesday and Thursday. From next month, I will attend Hapkido Classes. I\u2019m going to also attend swimming classes during the summer vacation.\u201dSitting on a soft sofa, Seojun answered while putting one finger down at a time. The couple was surprised by Seojun how fast Seojun could learn things.Seojun had a lot of things he wanted to learn. He could learn anything with some time and relaxation.He also want to learn how to ride a horse, but there was still a long way to learn them.He was going to learn them when vacation starts.In addition to that, he also wanted to learn kendo and some foreign languages. he was going to discuss with his mom and dad to learn slowly so that it won\u2019t become a burden on him.Lee Ji-Seok scratched his cheek, was a daily life of an elementary student busier than his?-Seojun, do you know what cameo is?\u201cYes, I know.\u201d-There is a drama I\u2019m filming right now. Do you want to try it if it\u2019s okay with you?\u201cUh, but\u2026\u201dWhy? Are you busy?\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen Seojun hesitated, Lee Ji-Seok replied immediately, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the cameo later and have a meal.\u201dSeojun nodded and made an appointment with Lee Ji-Seok.Weekend.Seojun headed to Cocoa Entertainment with his mother, wearing a Golem bag that Kim Hee-sung gave him as a gift.It was decided that Cocoa Entertainment will be the meeting place with Lee Ji-Seok.This was because it was a safer place than a cafe where people would recognize Lee Ji-Seok and Seojun.In addition, there were only few people coming to work because it was the weekend.Seo Eun-Chan, who is now the president, came down to the first floor after receiving their call.\u201cAh hahaha. Seojun, your front teeth fell out. You became cuter.\u201dSeo Eun-Chan welcomed Seojun and laughed at his front teeth. Seojun\u2019s lips were pouted at his laughter.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cStop teasing him!\u201dAfter Seo Eun-Hye hit Seo Eun-Chan\u2019s back, she looked around because she couldn\u2019t see any other employees.\u201cYour staff members?\u201d\u201cOnly the people who are needed came to work. We don\u2019t have much work these days because of the renewal of the Brown Black kids. There are trainees, but they are practicing in the practice room. It\u2019s soundproof, so you don\u2019t have to worry about sounds leaking from their practice.\u201d\u201cOkay, this is a snack he could eat if he became hungry. Seojun, I\u2019ll pick you up later. Keep in touch.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeo Eun-Hye left, and Seojun, who was looking around the first floor, admired it.It was completely different from the old dirty building.Cocoa Entertainment, now that the owner changed it was using a five-story building. It was thanks to Seolun\u2019s investment to Seo Eun-chan.\u201cUncle. Your company is huge.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better than before, right? I think it\u2019s empty because there is only Brown Black, but I\u2019m going to start over now!\u201dSeo Eun-chan held Seojun\u2019s hand and guided his around Cocoa Entertainment.\u201cIt was a building used by another agency before, so I remodeled it a little. There was also a practice room in the basement, but it was narrow and old, so I changed it. It is now a completely new practice room, so Brown Black kids often come and practice. The first floor is a place for guests. There\u2019s a meeting room and a lounge. There\u2019s also the room where I keep this and that.\u201dSlowly, they looked around from the first to the fifth floor.On the fifth floor, there was the president\u2019s room used by Seo Eun-chan, with a photo of Brown Black and Seojun on one wall.He knows why Brown Black\u2019s agency has pictures of his brothers. But\u2026\u201cWhy is my picture here?\u201dHe understood if it was an \u201cangel\u201d picture.There were often stories that everyone carried it like a talisman.However, the picture attached here was taken by a photographer who took Seojun appeared as a demon.In the strong wind, the red attire spread out widely, and Seojun with a serious expression looking to one side.In the dark background, the yellow goblin energy only visible to Seojun\u2019s eyes was also photographed.The energy was the same as it is with CG, it was a great picture that could be used as a poster for \u2018The Devil.\u2019\u201cAhahaha. Why is this here?\u201dSeo Eun-chan quickly stood in front of the picture and covered the picture.He had a cold sweat. Before Seojun entered Cocoa Entertainment, he was going to hang a picture of Jin Natra from Shadowman 2 on the first floor.Seojun squinted and looked at Seo Eun-chan. Seo Eun-chan quickly pushed Seojun\u2019s body and left the president\u2019s office.\u201cI was going to recruit you little by little, but now it is gone!\u201d\u2018No, since you gave the investment, you are like the half owner of Cocoa Entertainment, right?\u2019 He wanted to say this, but if it was Seo Eun-Hye to say that it was that and this was this. He thinks Seojun would say the same because they are mother and son.Seo Eun-chan sighed.\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it time for you to meet with Ji-Seok? Let\u2019s go to the meeting room on the first floor!\u201d\u201cYou are very suspicious, Uncle.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know that his nephew\u2019s meaningful eyes would fall.Seo Eun-Chan quickly picked Seojun up in the elevator and went down to the first floor.Seojun can roughly predict what his uncle is thinking. Seojun scratched his cheek.\u2018I\u2019m also unfamiliar with other agencies. But Cocoa Entertainment doesn\u2019t have an actor.\u2019He was also discussing with my mom and dad.Is chosing Cocoa Entertainment, with someone he knows from, or another agency with experience in caring for actors? The company to which Lee Ji-Seok belongs was also on the list.At the end of the family meeting, opinions were gathered and the verdict was it would be better to have a reliable person because he is still a child now.There is his investment, so they won\u2019t make him do anything. This was Lee Min-Joon\u2019s opinion. That\u2019s true for Seo Eun-hye, too. Then she nodded and Seojun agreed.\u201cMy uncle is really scared of my mom.\u201d\u2019Now his uncle contacts his maternal grandmother regularly and go home safely.[I\u2019m on the 1st floor]The elevator stopped. Seo Eun-chan guided Seojun to the conference room.He also gave Seojun an orange juice from the lounge and sat in front of him. Seo Eun-Chan opened his mouth looking at Seojun.\u201cSo, did you decide on your agency?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dHis mom and dad told him that he could tell his uncle, so he should tell him.Seojun opened his mouth.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cReally? Where?\u201d\u201cCocoa Entertainment.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dSeo Eun-chan understood it a second late and raised his hands.\u2018Hurray! The big fish that I\u2019ve been aiming for for a long time has finally come into my hands.\u2019Having the top idol Brown Black and superstar Lee Seojun can be bragged about anywhere!\u201cBut.\u201dWhen Seojun\u2019s mouth opened, Seo Eun-chan, who was cheering, stopped. Seoju shrugged and continued to talk.\u201cI\u2019m at my uncle\u2019s company until I become a high school student. After that, I will go to the agency that takes the best care of me.\u201dSeojun until high school student.Seo Eun-chan, who was lost in thought, opened his mouth.\u201cWhat if you like how we handle you?\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll keep working with my uncle.\u201dHonestly, his mom and dad\u2019s opinion is what matters the most.Even if it is their first time taking care an actor, there are still nine years left before he could really decide. With that amount of time, any new agency would have been able to take full care of Seojun.Moreover, he was not an unknown child actor where they will invest for promotion and such. He was Lee Seojun, who had many script proposals and advertisements coming at his feat.\u201cThe fact that work comes in even if you stay still will be the reason why we need to take care of you more.\u201dSeojun nodded at Seo Eun-chan\u2019s words. That was why other agencies were eliminated.If other agencies worked carelessly with the idea that he was a big fish that they had already caught, it would be poisonous to Seojun and his career.In addition, are there any agencies that often cause accidents in the name of the actor?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seojun also pulled his chair close to him with a serious expression, unlike his uncle\u2019s.\u201cAny other conditions?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll think about the drama or movie suggested by Cocoa Entertainment, but I won\u2019t accept it if I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d\u201cEven if a new actor comes in, you can\u2019t attach my name to him.\u201d\u201cNo attaching your name\u2026 where did you learn that?\u201d\u201cNo. Ji-Seok taught me.\u201dSeojun had already asked advice from Brown Black and Lee Ji-Seok and other acquaintances in the Korean and American entertainment industries.\u2018Should I be with them until I become an adult?\u2019It was also them who proposed a time limit of till middle school.Since there are more roles to play for high school students, they said that the agency\u2019s care is definitely needed from then on.Seo Eun-chan, who was scratching his head with a pen, nodded. Actor Lee Ji Seok.Other than Lee Ji-Seok, many people would have already said their advice for him.Seo Eun-chan, who was thinking of Seojun\u2019s personal connections, swallowed his saliva.\u201cOkay, no using of your name, next?\u201d\u201cWe have to sign an overseas movie contract separately.\u201d\u201cOkay. I didn\u2019t even think about that place.\u201d\u2018Did he mean Marine? Going into Hollywood. I didn\u2019t even think about it.\u2019Seojun quietly told Seo Eun-chan what he decided with his mother and father.There was more content that valued Seojun\u2019s opinion than money.No matter how much works Seojun does in a year, he does it if he wants to and will not do it if he doesn\u2019t want to.They don\u2019t care how many years he will take off.Not knowing when Seojun would want to do something else, his mom and dad suggested conditions for Seojun from one to ten.\u201cRe-signing will be after graduating from middle school.\u201d\u201cYeah. There\u2019s no more?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ve told you everything I have to tell you.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll write a contract with this. I will also talk about it with my sister and brother-in-law.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cOh, by the way. What\u2019s the appointment time?\u201dThey didn\u2019t even realize that the time went by so fast.Seojun and Seo Eun-chan looked at the clock hung in the conference room.Fortunately, there were still 20 minutes left until the appointment time.\u201cYou have some time left. Do you want to read some script?\u201d\u201cThere is still some Script?\u201d\u201cThere is a lot of proposals coming. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have a lot of production. These days, I think the amount has increased because of the increasing demand for web dramas.\u201d\u201cYes, I want to read them!\u201d\u201cI hope there\u2019s something Seojun likes this time. What if they don\u2019t want you because of your front teeth?\u201d\u201cUncle!\u201d\u201cHAHAHA!\u201dLee Ji-Seok came to Cocoa Entertainment with his manager Yoon Sung-oh.\u201cIt\u2019s completely different from the picture.\u201dCocoa Entertainment completely changed the span of few months after the president changed.It was definitely different from the old building that would usually appear on news and Internet articles.\u201cThe president changed, and investment came in, so it changed completely. They will definitely hire more employees.\u201dThe office was spacious and clean.New employees were also hired. There were also new talented and attractive trainees.The trainees, who were surprised to see Lee Ji-Seok over there, became shy and ran toward the staff, guiding them to debut after a few months.When Lee Ji-Seok waved, the surprised trainees bowed down to greet him and disappeared immediately to the practice room like a flock of sparrows while going to the convenience store to buy snacks.With the guidance of the staff, Lee Ji-Seok and manager Yoon Sung-oh opened the conference room on the first floor.Seojun, who was sitting in a chair was rummaging through script given by his uncle, welcomed the two.He came just in time for their appointment.\u201cJisheok-Hyung! Seongoh-Hyung! Hello!\u201d (TL: The author here really misspelled the names because of the airy pronunciation of Seojun)\u201cPfft. That\u2019s why you hesitated.\u201dLee Ji-Seok couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter when he saw Seojun\u2019s empty front teeth.Looking at his cute, charismatic, and cool appearance, his ordinary appearance may seem awkward, but Seojun looked perfect like a very naughty child.Yoon Sung-oh also covered his mouth with his hand because a laughter seemed to burst out.Seojun said with a displeased face.\u201cThis was already the second time today.\u201d\u201cYour pronunciation is leaking, too.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know on the phone.\u201d\u201cThe wind keeps coming out this way. Later on, this and this will fall too. Really! I don\u2019t think I can act seriously until my permanent teeth come out.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dLee Ji-Seok sat down smiling. Manager Yoon Sung-oh also sat next to him.Lee Ji-Seok took a bunch of paper from his bag and handed it over to Seojun. It was the script of the drama in which he is acting on.\u201cIs this the script?\u201d\u201cOkay. What do you think?\u201d[Re-investigation]Even the title screams \u201cMystery!\u201dSeojun flapped over the script.In the second half of the script, there was a place marked with a highlighter and post-it. There were about three lines.\u201cIt\u2019s just a Cameo role that has nothing to do with the drama.\u201d\u201cAre you okay with it?\u201dRather than replying, Seojun showed Lee Ji-Seok his empty front teeth.Lee Ji-Seok burst into laughter again.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. It looks better on you.\u201d\u201cWhat role is it?\u201d\u201cThe role of an elementary school student who says the hit-and-run car number.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really\u2026\u201dSeojun nodded when he heard Lee Ji-Seok.\u201cIt looks good on me.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? Do you want to do it?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s read what kind of drama it is.\u201dSeojun packed the scripts he received from Lee Ji-Seok in his bag. The Golem doll on the zipper of the bag rattled.Lee Ji-Seok stood up smiling.\u201cLet\u2019s go eat lunch.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cIs there a good restaurant near here?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a dumpling restaurant in front of the building. They sell cold noodles, too!\u201dLee Ji-Seok laughed at the memory of eating dumplings together during \u2018The Devil\u2019 shooting.\u201cCold noodles are good.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d\u201cI know. The dumplings were good, too.\u201dAfter having a satisfactory lunch, the three took a walk together. No one recognized Seojuun and Lee Ji-Seok because they were wearing hats and masks.\u201cI think we should have just met outside.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dWhen Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok laughed and talked, Yoon Sung-oh shook his head.People were passing by, but they were busy making fun of their feet as if they were using this road to go somewhere else.Well, he heard that there was a road across the main road, and everyone seemed to have gone there. Yoon Sung-oh scratched his head.\u201cHey\u2026\u201dThree people were surprised by the sudden voice.Yoon Sung-oh naturally blocked the two and talked with the person. Seojun\u2019s eyes sparkled at sight.\u2018A Top actor\u2019s manager!\u2019Uncle Chan\u2019s words to introduce Seojun\u2019s manager the next time he came to Cocoa Entertainment appeared in his mind. What kind of person is he? \u2018I wish he would be this cool.\u2019\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dThe man shrank his neck with a slightly cold voice.Seojun applauded Yoon Sung-oh\u2019s change of voice. He seemed to be intimidating right now.\u201cHey, if you have time, why don\u2019t you watch a play? Kids can watch it, too.\u201d\u201cA play?\u201dPlay.Lee Ji-Seok and Seojun reacted to the word. They were two actors who could talk all day long about movies and dramas. The play was also indispensable.Yoon Sung-oh\u2019s stiff expression slowly loosened.Perhaps he felt the change, but the man continued in a clear voice.\u201cYes. There is a small theater nearby. The content is fun, and everyone is good at acting. You won\u2019t regret watching it.\u201dYoon Sung-oh received the flyer handed out by the man and gave it to Lee Ji-Seok and Seojun.[My neighborhood]Well, just looking at the title, they couldn\u2019t guess what it was about.Lee Ji-Seok tapped Seojun on the shoulder with his hand. Lee Ji-Seok winked when Seojun raised his head.\u201cDo you want to watch?\u201dSeojun nodded. He watched few plays in the United States, but this is his first time watching a play in Korea.\u201cIf you buy the ticket from me, I\u2019ll give you a 20%, no, 40% percent discount.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201dThe shoulders of the man, who was working hard, dropped at Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s words. He doesn\u2019t know how many rejections he has heard so far.\u2018What if there\u2019s no audience today?\u2019The man, who pretended not to be disappointed, thought about the disappointed face of the members. He tried to turn around and find another audience.At that time, Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s voice was stuck in the man\u2019s ear.\u201cWe like plays. We can buy it at a regular price. How much is it?\u201dAt Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s words, the man\u2019s face was in full bloom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some came from other troupes and some were new to Plays.They saved money and rented this small theater, but there was no staff who would manage and produced the stage.All of this was created by actors only.There were only Seven people on their trupe. All of them loved theater and acting.\u201cSigh. How many did you sell?\u201d\u201cOnly three tickets. One child and two adults.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Our play is for the General audience, we almost couldn\u2019t even sell three tickets.\u201dEveryone smiled faintly at the words of Han Ji-ah, who will play the heroine.Kim Sun-Gon, the leader of the \u2018Wind\u2019 group received a phone call earlier from Kim Seung-wu, the super president.\u201cIt\u2019s not time to laugh.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201cThey bought it at a regular price.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThey said they like watching plays and bought it at a regular price even though Seong-Wu gave 40 percent discount.\u201dEveryone was speechless at Kim Sun-gon\u2019s words. They said they like plays. That word stuck in their hearts.\u201cSEONG WU, why did he sell at a 40% discount? The rental fee won\u2019t even be covered! And why is he offering a discount at the regular price?\u2026.\u201dHan Ji-ah couldn\u2019t continue to talk, perhaps because she was too emotional while talking like she was scolding.It\u2019s already been three days since she only looked at the empty audience from the stage.Even a thousand won (TL: 1$) matters.Kim Sun-gon clapped his hands.\u201cEveryone, wake up! They bought tickets to watch a play because they like it! We are going to show them a play that\u2019s very worthy of their attention!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dIt was their first audience after a long time. There were only three people, but everyone were very excited.\u201cHello! Are you here to watch the play?\u201dOne child, two adults. It\u2019s these people! Han Ji-ah welcomed the three with a bright smile.The three people who were looking for the entrance to the small theater nodded at Han Ji-ah\u2019s words.\u201cThe entrance is this way It\u2019s on the second floor, so you have to go up. You can give me the ticket.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dHan Ji-ah received the tickets from the three people and tore them in half. With Han Ji-ah\u2019s guidance, Seojun and the two adults climbed the narrow stairs and entered the small theater.The theater was small. The stage and auditorium were very close and there were only a few seats.Han Ji-ah smiled and said to the three people looking around the theater.\u201cYou can sit anywhere. If you want the center is good, and if you want to see the actors up close, the front seat is good too.\u201d\u201cWhere do you want to sit?\u201dThe theater was small, so there was little difference whether it was in the middle or in the front, but Seojun still took time to choose.\u201cI want to see you in the middle.\u201d\u201cYes, then we sit there. We can watch it here the best.\u201dHan Ji-ah smiled brightly at Seojun\u2019s answer, he informed her of her ideal spot. There was no one in the audience, so she thought they would go back. Contrary to her worries, the three didn\u2019t care much.\u201cIt\u2019s going to start after a while later. Enjoy watching it.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201dHan Ji-ah left, and Lee Ji-Seok and Seojun took off their hats.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sweating\u201d.\u201cBut it\u2019s cool here.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t take it off like that. Both of you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. There\u2019s no one else watching.\u201dYoon Sung-oh sighed at the words of Lee Ji-Seok. Seojun turned his head around to see the small theater.When they sat down, the stage was really too close.\u2018I think I\u2019ll be able to see the actor\u2019s sweat.\u2019\u201cBut it\u2019s really small.\u201d\u201cI think this is the smallest theater. The rental fee will be really cheap.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no one here\u2026 They don\u2019t think they can even earn something. I guess this is their everything.\u201dLee Ji-Seok and Seojun nodded at Yoon Sung-oh\u2019s words. Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok were a little sad to see an empty theater.* * *\u201cI don\u2019t think I can go up!\u201dHan Ji-ah jumped in. Kim Sun-Gon slapped his forehead.\u201cHow can the main character guide the guests?\u201d\u201cMy clothes are also casual clothes, right? There\u2019s nothing to dress up for! More than that, three people\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go. There were those people who said there weren\u2019t many audiences and went back!\u201dAt that time, there were five people, but because there weren\u2019t any other audiences they returned to their homes.\u201cOkay. Okay. Get ready for the stage.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThey were Han Ji-ah and other actors who were excited about having an audience after a long time. Everyone waited for the curtain to rise on the stage with an excited face. Kim Sun-Gon applauded.\u201cEveryone is so excited. You need to Calm down.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWhen Kim Sun-Gon put his hands down, everyone reached out and put their hands above his.They will their usual routine. But today, there was an audience. Everyone shouted the title of the play with pounding hearts.\u201cMy neighborhood!\u201d\u201cFighting!\u201d***\u201cI can hear them.\u201d\u201cAhahaha. This place lacks soundproofing.\u201dThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, but they could definitely hear the sound of \u201cFighting! My neighborhood!\u201d The two actors and the manager laughed at the loud voices of the theater actors.They were more excited about what kind of play it would be and what kind of acting it would be.Soon, the lights on the audience, where only three people were sitting, darkened, and the stage was illuminated.\u201cI guess it\u2019s about to start\u201d.Lee Ji-Seok and Seojun\u2019s expressions changed.Yoon Sung-oh shook his head. They were actors who will change in an instant when it comes to acting. Lee Ji-Seok has been there for five years, but Seojun is just a newbie. He even appeared in Hollywood movies even at a young age.\u201cDo they know that Lee Ji-Seok and Lee Seojun are watching their play?\u201d\u2019There\u2019s no way they would know.Soon, Yoon Sung-oh also focused on the stage.The play began with an incident that took place in a small neighborhood.The heroine, a detective, drew laughter as misunderstandings and delusions happens while she investigated the local people.She eventually caught the criminal as if she were catching a rat while stepping back, but the detective could not resolve the misunderstanding of the local people until the end.\u201cI\u2019m not a real estate agent! I\u2019m a detective! A DE. TEC. TIVE!\u201dThey heard the child\u2019s clear laughter. They also heard the laughter of the two adults. Kim Sun-Gon, who was looking at the stage and the audience, put strength into his hands. This was their real reaction. As expected, the play was good.\u201cSunbae! It\u2019s your turn to go out!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dHan Ji-ah and other actors also put smiles on their faces.\u201cHey, if you laugh like that, you can\u2019t act! You\u2019re supposed to be sad!\u201cSunbae! You have to be really serious right now, but you\u2019re laughing so hard!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help it. It was so exciting and fun.Their heartbeat was like it was about to explode.It was just before his clothes were sweaty and his makeup was erased because of the hot lighting and the acting, but it was good.This is why he couldn\u2019t get out of here.\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here!\u201dThe play ended with a pleasant laugh.Yoon Sung-oh smiled and applauded.\u201cIt\u2019s so much fun!\u201d\u201cI know. I didn\u2019t expect much. Everyone did well and the content was fun.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Seojun.\u201dAt Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s words, Seojun answered with a small hand, clapping hard.\u201cEveryone, you did a great job.\u201dObviously, in Seojun\u2019s eyes, something lacked in the performance of the members, but that was because Seojun\u2019s has been exposed to high quality performance. Seojun knew that, too.In addition, dramas and movies actors studied hard in acting and it further raised Seojun\u2019s standards for acting to the fullest.The general public may thought they were good, but in Seojun\u2019s standards it was not enough.But it was good. He could feel on their actions how much they loved acting. Just like him in his first life.Seojun praised their hearts more.Small but loud applause rang in the small theater. The actors standing behind the curtain heard applause and eventually shed tears.\u201cHey, don\u2019t cry. We haven\u2019t even taken a picture yet.\u201d\u201cYes, but it keeps coming out.\u201d\u201cWipe it now.\u201dKim Seong-wu, who sold tickets and went on the stage and wiped away her tears.At that time, he was really glad to talk to those people. The members were delighted even with the blurry view.Everyone stopped crying and stood on the stage holding hands with red eyes. When they bowed down and greeted, they heard applause again.\u201cDo you want to take a picture with the actors?\u201dWhen Kim Sun-Gon\u2019s eyes turned a little red, a person without a hat looked back at the child and the man wearing a hat. The child shrugged and the man wearing the hat smiled quietly.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. It was really fun.\u201d\u201cI like it, too!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be crazy.\u201dYoon Sung-oh sighed and guided the two in front of the actors. He looked like a bodyguard, so the actors tilted their heads.\u201cSeong Wu, what are these people doing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I saw them coming out of the naengmyeon restaurant.\u201d\u201cShh.\u201dHan Ji-ah and Kim Sung-woo, who were whispering, closed their mouths.The leader of the small group, \u201cWind\u201d. Yoo Sun-gon smiled brightly and took a step forward.\u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d\u201cYes. It was a lot of fun.\u201cThank you\u2026.\u201dYoo Seon-gon, who was trying to bow, stopped talking. This was because Lee Ji-Seok took off the hat that he was wearing.Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s handsome face was revealed in the bright lighting. Starting with Yoo Sun-gon, everyone in the stage clearly saw his face.\u201cGasp!\u201d\u201cLee Ji-Seok!\u201dKim Seong-wu, who unknowingly spoke, covered his mouth. Lee Ji-Seok continued to say hello with his eyes.\u201cSeojun said he enjoyed it, too.\u201d\u201cIt was so much fun!\u201dSeojun also took off his hat and bowed and smiled brightly.What? Who?A moment of silence subsided in the small theater.As if they finally recognized Lee Ji-Seok and Lee Seojun in their head, among the theater actors, a scream \u2018Argh1\u2019 burst out.\u201cLee Seojun!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is this a dream?\u201dThere were only seven members, and the response was enormous.Everyone glistened and breathed heavily.Lee Ji-seok and Seojun thought about taking a step back from their intense reaction. Yoon Sung-oh felt very nervous at the current situation.Clap!Kim Sun-gon hit Kim Seong-Wu\u2019s back, who was the closest.Fortunately, everyone came back to their senses with a sharp sound. They took a deep breath and calmed down.\u201cOh, oh, oh, hello. Actor Lee Seojun. I\u2019m a huge fan.\u201dSeojun shook his hands and smiled, holding each of the theater actors\u2019 hands, who asked for a handshake.Kim Seong-wu, who ignored the Kim Sun-Gon, brought clean paper and asked Lee Ji-Seok and Seojun for their autographs.\u201cPhotos! Let\u2019s take pictures!\u201d\u201cGive it to me. I\u2019ll take it for you. I don\u2019t really like pictures.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you!\u201dAt Yoon Sung-oh\u2019s words, Kim Sun-Gon, who was thinking about whether to be excluded from the picture, thanked him.Kim Sun-Gon\u2019s cell phone captured the seven theater actors, Seojun, and Lee Ji-Seok. And they took a picture again with Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s phone.\u201cSenior. Send me the picture later.\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201dKim Sun-Gon posted the picture in their group chat room of Kakao Talk.Everyone downloaded it with a happy face. Lee Ji-Seok, who received a phone from Yoon Sung-oh, also sent the picture to Seojun.\u201cIs it okay to post this on the internet? For promotion,\u201d asked Kim Sun-Gon.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dUnlike Seojun, who answered without much thought, Lee Ji-Seok, who had suffered from fame, scratched his cheek.\u201cWe don\u2019t care, but if you promote it that there is a celebrity, it\u2019ll be that hard. In particular, Seojun who has the attention focused on him these days so many people will definitely cause some disturbances.\u201dOnce they made a mistake, they might not be able to deal with it.\u201cIt\u2019s already been three days since we stood on the stage without an audience. You were the only people who came to watch our play today. Without the audience today, we might not have showcased this work at all. Some of our members may have quit the play. But we like plays. I want to continue. So we can overcome it.\u201d Kim\u00a0Sun-gon said with a smile.All members of the Wind Theater nodded. Han Ji-ah said with a solid expression.\u201cI\u2019ll do my best not to disappoint those who trusted me.\u201dSeojun, who was listening to people\u2019s stories, tilted his head.\u2018Why are they so worried about posting only pictures?\u2019Seojun was not yet familiar with the life of a star and the daily life of a celebrity.\u201cI\u2019m going to ask Ji-Seok later!\u201dAfter talking about photo, Kim Seong-wu, who sold tickets carefully, opened his mouth with the spirit of the youngest who has just become an adult.\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you saw any shortcomings in our play, please tell us\u201d.Everyone wanted to say it, but they couldn\u2019t.The fact that Lee Ji-Seok made his debut as a drama after doing plays was a fact that everyone here knew except Seojun.Lee Ji-seok looked at the clock without realizing it.\u201cI have to take Seojun home\u2026\u201dSeojun, who noticed what he is implying, raised his hands.\u201cI\u2019m curious, too!\u201d\u201cThen shall we talk a little bit before we go?\u201dThe members cheered at Lee Ji-seok\u2019s answer.* * *The Internet became noisy with photos posted on SNS two days ago.[#Lee Seojun #Lee Ji-Seok #My neighborhood #Play][Title: I watched my neighborhoodI\u2019m a fan of Lee Seojun I browsed his name every day. Then, I saw the picture less than 10 minutes after it was uploaded. As soon as I saw it, I ran out! The tickets were almost sold out and I was able to buy tickets for the last play!After a minute I bought mine, it was sold out! (Laughs)I had a lot of time, so I looked around the shops near the small theater and ate.There were many people like me, and there were people here and there.The owner of the store I went to said that there were suddenly more people and that he wanted this to continue happening.Anyway, when I entered the small theater, there were few audience seats and the stage was very close. When you buy tickets it is on a first-come, first-served basis, numbers 1 and 2 are written on the table, which is the best.Lee Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok chair was even marked. They were some people taking pictures while sitting there.By the way, I think it will soon turn into a big theater.The play was fun. I kept laughing. Everyone laughed a lot.And after the play, I talked to the actors, and everyone asked about Lee Ji-Seok and Lee Seojun. The actors responded to the audience enthusiastically as if they expected that they will ask about Lee Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok.\u2018Lee Seojoon, Lee Jiseok, and their manager all enjoyed it. At first, I didn\u2019t know it was Lee Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok. I knew it when we took a picture. I had lunch with Lee Ji-Seok and Lee Seo Jun at the naengmyeon store in front of the building. Lee Ji-Seok even gave us a piece of advice on the play. Maybe it\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t acted in a play for a while so he came to watch. Also, Lee Seojun learned with us.\u2019]-That naengmyeon store is where I usually ate. And I realized I ate together with Lee Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok. They didn\u2019t seem to know that I went there too.-Ah, Lee Seojun and the actors learned together. So cute.\u2013 In 30 minutes, tickets sold per day tickets were sold out. I failed to buy one again today. I hope they can move to a bigger place soon.\u2026.-I am looking for it now. They have a contract period, so it\u2019s kind of weird to just move away.-The naengmyeon restaurant is going to be crazy too. Everyone was worried because that neighborhood wasn\u2019t having any people lately. Thanks to the two, the shops survived.-My opinion. I just forced myself to laugh, and the acting wasn\u2019t good. I don\u2019t know why they recommended it.-It\u2019s not a recommendation. They just watched a play and took a picture together.-Me too. I wouldn\u2019t have watched it if it weren\u2019t for the two.-Aren\u2019t they promoting this because they received money? Their skills weren\u2019t that great either.-It was fun for me. It felt like my stress was relieved.-I agree. But everyone only cared about Lee Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok and only asks the actors that question. I couldn\u2019t even asked about the play.-It was a bit weird to just talk about that. The actors were good at acting. I\u2019m looking forward to their next work.-First of all, it\u2019s all about work. Still, this was an opportunity to make their name known, so it could be a good opportunity for the theater group. They have to make this work and lead it to the next one.Seojun, who got into Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s car, read the comments while looking at the screen of his cell phone.Two days ago, when he even gave advice to the theater actors and left the small theater, Seojun asked Lee Ji-Seok.\u2018Why should I worry about posting a picture on the Internet?\u2019Lee Ji-seok, who had been thought for a while, said he would know if he waited a little longer.And now\u2026Seojun, who got into Lee Ji-seok\u2019s car to go to the filming location of the drama, finally realized what Ji-Seok meant back then.Throughout the two days, Yoon Sung-oh and Lee Ji-Seok collected comments that they thought could be read by Seojun.They thought about whether they could show it to him or edit it, but it would be a little insufficient to explain it in words. Lee Ji-seok couldn\u2019t take his eyes off from Seojun\u2019s face.And Seojun nodded without showing other expressions. When children browse the Internet or watch YouTube, they need a guidance from parents or adults, because malicious comments were inevitable.\u201cThis much is already okay.\u201dLee Ji-Seok continued with a sigh of relief.\u201cPeople wonder what celebrities eat, watch, and do. Among them, fans are the ones that pay attention to them more. In particular, Seojun doesn\u2019t have many eyewitnesses and no interviews, so people will be interested in what you do to the smallest things. See? There\u2019s an article already, right?\u201dAs Lee Ji-seok said, there were all kinds of articles on the Internet, including the meeting between Lee Ji-Seok and Seojun, the play the two watched, the introduction of the play, and the interview with the owner of the cold noodle shop.A reporter even made a click-bait title with \u201cA play highly praised by Hollywood actors!\u201dSeojun tilted his head when he read the title. It\u2019s not wrong, but it felt too exaggerated.\u201cIn a play, an actor sees the audience\u2019s reaction in real time, it is immediately marked. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s not fun. I was looking forward to these articles, but if they don\u2019t meet the audience\u2019s expectations, it\u2019s not good for the theater group either. Also, the theater is already small, but if people suddenly flock because of our name value, will the actors be hit by people, and can they even act properly? I was worried about that.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dSeojun nodded. He looked at the cell phone screen again.[A play highly praised by Hollywood actor Lee Seojun!][Lee Ji-Seok and Lee Seojun\u2019s play is different!][A play chosen by great actors who thought it was and even gave advice]These were the titles of articles that really made people look forward to.The people of the Wind Theater that Seojun met a few days ago came to his mind.\u2018Will they be able to meet the public expectation?\u2019\u201cWill you be able to do well?\u201d\u201cThey have to overcome the pressure. They said it themselves. They can overcome it. If they overcome this ordeal, they\u2019ll be a great troupe.\u201dLee Ji-Seok stroked Seojun\u2019s worried head and said.\u201cSeojun. Celebrities like us are what people pay more attention to than ordinary people. I don\u2019t know what kind of things will happen when I inadvertently post a picture of a word that unconsciously said or promoted.\u201dSeojun nodded at Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s words.\u201cSeojun you don\u2019t have an SNS, do you?\u201d Manager Yoon Sung-oh said without realizing it, like an occupational disease.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make it from now on either. That\u2019s the root of all evil for celebrities.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a role that could be used for a famous child actor.Then the director and the writer discussed with each other.The main actor, Lee Ji-Seok, who was sitting next to him, said he would bring a good actor.Anyone was fine. Really. He could even take an unknown child for the role. Lee Ji-Seok was strict in acting, so they believed in his recruiting skills, but\u2026 A Hollywood actor for just a cameo?\u201cWhat?\u201dDirector Choi Min-sung and writer So Eun-jin asked again.What nonsense is this popular actor saying? Is today April Fool\u2019s Day?The two people who were asking for the dates shook their heads.April Fool\u2019s Day is already over.Lee Ji-Seok smiled and stepped aside.\u201cTa-da!\u201d\u201cTa-da!\u201dShouting, a child appeared behind Lee Ji-Seok.Director Choi and writer So\u2019s eyes opened wide.He was the current hot topic in Korea. How can they not recognize his face?It was really Lee Seojun.Really, the same Lee Seojun whom they watched at the movie theater!Director Choi Min-sung, who watched Shadowman 2 four times, and writer So Eun-jin, who joined Seojun\u2019s fan cafe, grabbed their heart.Still, they couldn\u2019t take their eyes off Seojun, who was smiling brightly.\u201cGasp!\u201dLee Ji-Seok laughed at the two meetings their idol.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time filming a drama, so I came for a field trip. Is it okay?\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, yes, yes. Yes!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay! It\u2019s totally okay!\u201dThe two people, who had been nodding at Lee Seojun\u2019s question, suddenly came to their senses.\u201cWait. Juice. Juice should be here.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the juice too sweet? Is there be something to eat?\u201d\u201cOh, is that so? Then what should I give you\u2026.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s sit down.\u201d Lee Ji-Seok said, looking at the restless two. They weren\u2019t like this when he was young. Seojun is really amazing.\u201cYes, yes. That\u2019s right. actor Lee Seojun\u2019s legs will hurt.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the chair too hard? Cushion! Cushion!\u201dWriter So Eun-jin left the set in search of a cushion. Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok blinked.The director left earlier to pick snacks. Only two people remained in the empty set.\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t need a cushion.\u201d\u201cI think everyone likes you so much\u2026\u201dSoon after, the two returned.Writer So Eun-jin, who brought three vinyl-wrapped cushions, and director Choi Min-sung, who bought a lot of snacks and drinks as if he had bought an entire convenience store, put them in a chair near Seojun.When Seojun sat on the cushion and drank orange juice, they looked at Seojun with an emotional look. Tears covered their eyes.\u2018Be happy. Jin Natra!\u2019***\u201cHmm.\u201dThe two came to their senses when Lee Ji-Seok coughed. Producer Choi Min-sung and writer So Eun-jin cleared themselves by slapping their cheeks.\u201cOh, you were talking about the cameo.\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019d appreciate it if actor Lee Seojun would appear.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s a role that only comes out once. Is it okay?\u201dSeojun replied with a nod.\u201cI\u2019ve read all the parts where my cameo part will appear from Ji-Seok\u2019s. My mom and dad said it would be entertaining, and I also enjoyed reading it.\u201dThey say it sounds fun!Writer So Eun-jin held her hands tightly while celebrating inside her. \u2018A Hollywood actor said my script is fun!\u2019\u201cI think you are a good director because I enjoyed watching the drama you did back when I was in the U.S.\u201dProducer Choi Min-sung covered his mouth with his hands. \u2018He watched my drama!\u00a0 He said I am good at directing, too! I felt like I became a successful fan.\u2019Lee Ji-Seok shook his head as he saw the two thrilled people.\u201cJi-Seok, who is good at acting, is the lead, so I decided to be a cameo.\u201dLee Ji-Seok, who was scoffing at the two, soon took back his words. \u2018Seojun said I\u2019m good at acting!\u2019Seojun, who impressed the three with his words, drank juice as if nothing had happened.The praising time, which seemed to have last for a long time, quickly ended. This was because staff members began to appear on the set one by one for filming.\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s hide actor Lee Seojun until the shooting.\u201d\u201cYou can call me Seojun.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201dAt Seojun\u2019s words, the two became more thrilled as they were privilege to call him casually.\u201cOf course. Will Seojun be with Ji-Seok\u2019s manager? That would be better, right?\u201cYou can say I am Ji-Seok\u2019s nephew.\u201d\u201cYes, I got it!\u201dSeojun wore the hat he had worn before and ran towards manager Yoon Sung-oh, standing in the corner while checking Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s schedule.He didn\u2019t know that the eyes of PD Choi Min-Sung and writer So Eun-Ji would follow Seojun\u2019s back.\u201cSo cute!\u201d\u201cI know. How can he act like that with such a cute face?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why people say he is a genius.\u201d\u201cJi-Seok! You\u2019re really incredible. How did you bring actor Lee Seojun? No, Seojun?Lee Ji-Seok said with a smile at PD Choi Min-Sung\u2019s question.\u201cYou heard the reason earlier. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dThe two, who thought it was just a compliment, if not an empty word, asked with a surprised face.They were happy with a compliment even if he didn\u2019t mean it, but he was serious?\u201cIf he didn\u2019t like the script and directing, he would have just refused my request. That\u2019s how much he like acting.\u201d Lee Ji-Seok shrugged and said.\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cSeojun appears in this drama because he finds it fun. Then you can brag about it to others. Thanks to you, an actor named Lee Seojun became interested in the drama.\u201dThe eyes of the two got bigger.Lee Ji-Seok laughed. He thought while watching Jin Natra of Shadowman 2 work with Seojun again. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was a movie or a drama.\u201cIf there is another script that he likes, maybe he will act again for you.\u201dThe eyes of producer Choi Min-sung and writer So Eun-jin sparkled.If only Lee Seojun appeared, anyone would invest, and any broadcasting station would schedule it during prime time. It was clear that his fame would allow their drama exposure.\u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dThe three adults whispered as if they were formulating a secret mission.Yoon Sung-oh, who was watching the scene, shook his head.They want to film with Seojun again!It was what Lee Ji-Seok wanted ever since he watched Shadowman 2.Seojun was sitting next to manager Yoon Sung-oh and looked around the set.\u201cThis is how drama shoots are.\u201d Lee Seojun said quietly.\u2018Which snack should I eat?\u2019 Seojun, who was agonizing over his snacks, turned his head and saw manager Yoon Sung-oh sitting next to him.Yoon Sung-oh smiled.Lee Ji-Seok wanted to know why Seojun was not filming the drama, but Yoon Sung-oh decided to ask it personally.\u201cSeojun, why aren\u2019t you filming a drama?\u201dSeojun opened his mouth while rolling his eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t have a script that I like. In addition, it\u2019s always a similar role, so I don\u2019t think it necessarily suits me.\u201dSeojun, who finished choosing snacks, opened the wrapper. When the bag of snacks was neatly torn off, Yoon Sung-oh applauded for his skills.\u201cIf you like the script, you will be going to appear in the drama, right?\u201d\u201cYes, but why are you asking?\u201d\u201cJi-Seok thinks you\u2019re not interested in dramas.\u201dSeojun, who was chewing snacks, shook his head. \u2018It\u2019s not like that.\u2019\u201cHe wants to film with you again, but he always thought you only like movies. So if you appear in a drama, the range will increase, and the probability of working together will increase.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t he just ask me?\u201dWhen they saw Lee Ji-Seok entering the set after finishing his makeup, Seojun said it without realizing it.Lee Ji-Seok, wearing a police uniform, waved at Seojun. Seojun also shook his hand.Yoon Sung-oh laughed.\u201cHe can\u2019t force you to appear in a Drama you don\u2019t like at your disposal. Also, he may not like the movie that you choose. Even if it is a coincidence that you both choose the same movie, he really looks forward to that happening.\u201dThe rehearsal has begun. Looking at the set where people were moving, Seojun listened to Yoon Sung-oh\u2019s words.\u201cI know Ji-Seok will definitely refuse what he doesn\u2019t like. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he\u2019ll definitely reject it. However, I think that if such rejection accumulates and accumulates, soon there will be an invisible gap between you two. That\u2019s how people feel. I understand how you feel, but I\u2019m a little disappointed. And eventually, you\u2019ll get farther away. Ji-Seok doesn\u2019t like that.\u201dSeojun nodded. He didn\u2019t know he was thinking like that. He also wants to shoot with Ji-Seok again.\u201cWhat should I do then?\u201d\u201cWell, I have no choice but to be lucky. Even if the two of us secretly manipulate, Ji-Seok will feel guilty if even he finds out. He will suffer for no reason because of his greed.\u201d\u201cJi-Seok\u2019s thoughts it\u2019s too complicated.\u201d\u201cAhahaha. He is just a delicate person.\u201dProducer Choi and writer So gave a gesture. They were going to shoot now. To attract Seojun to act in the dramas, the three decided to show Seojun the best scene from the script.Yoon Sung-oh, who temporarily became Seojun\u2019s guardian, stood up at their gesture to come there.\u201cYou just have to keep acting like you normally do.\u201dYoon Sung-oh said.Seojun looked up and saw Yoon Sung-oh.Yoon Sung-oh, who has been a manager next to Lee Ji-Seok for five years, recalled Lee Ji-Seok and Seojun\u2019s similar eyes.It was the eyes of actors who liked acting, longed for acting and loved acting.\u201cJi-Seok will never leave the acting industry. He will continue to act even when I am 10 or 20 years old. You feel the same way, right?\u201d\u201cYes, he is going to do it for a long time.\u201d\u201cIf we act in the same place for such a long time, there will definitely be times when we meet in the same work. Isn\u2019t this a small world?\u201dYoon Sung-oh, who was talking, burst into laughter. Come to think of it. This was a small world than he thought.\u201cBoth of you might get tired of it later, saying, \u2018Why are we working again together?'\u201d\u201cAhahaha. That\u2019s true.\u201dSeojun also laughed at Yoon Sung-oh\u2019s words. Unlike now, when child actors play few roles, this may really be the case when he grows up and starts playing adult roles.\u201cWhat? Why are you laughing?\u201dLee Ji-Seok, who was checking the script for the last time before filming, asked the two smiling people, but they both shut up as if they had compromised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was real.\u201dThe lighting director told the camera director. The camera operator nodded.Director Choi Min-Sung wants to keep it a secret about who would be the cameo, and writer So smiled and picked up the script.The staff guessed that Lee Ji-Seok was the one who invited him.\u201cIt\u2019s really Lee Seojun.\u201dShadowman 2 ended coming out from the Movie Theater after a month and a half of screening at the end of April.Perhaps because a Korean actor appeared, the number of Korean audiences was higher than other marine films.\u201cDidn\u2019t Shadowman 1 get more than 10 million Hearts?\u201d (TL: I don\u2019t know it is viewers of Hearts because the Raws it says hearts. Maybe some sort of voting in Korea or Likes on the Movie Review on internet?)During Shadowman 1, it exceeded 10 million thanks to the effects of \u201cTear Challenge\u201d and \u201cShadowman VS Green Wing.\u201d Not only in Korea but also around the world, will Marine set the stage for another showdown?\u201cWow. Is he the same actor with 10 million Hearts?\u201d\u201cNo. In Shadowman 1 he was an extra.\u2026 Isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cIf Shadowman 3 comes out, it will definitely hit 10 million.\u201dPeople whispering around him nodded.\u201cHow\u2019s school? Did you had fun?\u201dSeojun sighed at the question of Lee Ji-Seok, who had just finished dressing up. He had to wait for a little because he wasn\u2019t ready for the shoot yet.\u201cEveryone barely recognized me at the entrance ceremony, but after Shadowman 2 was released, everyone who watched the movie started recognizing me. My Kindergarten friends were fine, but those other grade Hyung and Noona are going crazy.\u201d\u201cWhy? Did they want your autographs?\u201d\u201cThey wanted my autograph as well as Shadowman\u2019s and Rachel\u2019s autograph.\u201dTeachers are blocking them well. Maybe in middle school he should attend an Art School. (TL: reference with Hanlim School in Korea, the school with many idols attending it.)Well, attending school for celebrities may be a better choice especially when there are days he needed to be absent for shooting.Lee Min-Joon and Seo Eun-Hye were also deeply troubled by it. Anyway, there is still 6 years left so they could decide slowly about that matter.At Seojun\u2019s words, Lee Ji-Seok unknowingly opened his mouth. The autographs of Evan Block and Rachel Hill.\u201c\u2026I want to get that too.\u201dThe staff, who were listening to the chatter of the two also nodded.\u201cNo. If I give you one, everyone would request me to provide them also an autograph. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is my own autograph, but I can\u2019t provide other\u2019s autograph.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Who taught it to you?\u201d\u201cMy Uncle.\u201d\u201cOh, your uncle is the owner of Cocoa Entertainment, right? Come to think of it, shouldn\u2019t Seojun find an agency now? There are no actors on Cocoa Entertainment, right? Perhaps, do you want to join my agency?\u201dYoon Sung-oh, who was looking at Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s schedule on his cell phone, lifted his head.Lee Ji-Seok was tongue-tied by the manager\u2019s momentum of taking out a promotional booklet of his agency from his bag and was ready to explain to Seojun about their agency.Still, his agency was a better place than other places.\u201cThere are a lot of actors, and I\u2019m there, too. The facilities are also good.\u201dSeojun shook his head while tilting his head.\u201cI\u2019m going to Cocoa Entertainment. They\u2019re looking for someone to be my manager.\u201dSeojun even signed the contract at his home. Of course, since he is a minor, the ones who signed are his parents, who are his guardians.Seo Eun-Chan, who received the contract excitedly, was the one who hanged Seojun\u2019s picture on the wall of the first floor. And he already started looking for Seojun\u2019s manager.\u201cReally? That\u2019s too bad.\u201dLee Ji-Seok thought they could be in the same agency, so he was disappointed.Yoon Sung-oh, who was listening to their chatter, put the booklet back in his bag with a disappointed face.\u201cActor Lee Ji-Seok! We will soon start the shoot.\u201dLee Ji-Seok stood up from his seat at the call of the director. Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s solo shooting began, after that Seojun\u2019s shoot was next.\u201cSure, I\u2019ll be back after the shoot.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dDrama filming felt faster than filming a movie. Both bust shots and close-up shots were less than in the movie.If Monday and Tuesday dramas are at this speed, daily dramas must be completely difficult.While looking around the set, a staff member brought a boy with a serious face while holding a soccer ball was on his side.\u201cActor Lee Seojun, you are going to film with him later. The shoot could be delayed, so please wait with him.\u201d\u201cYes, I see.\u201dThe boy sat in the seat where Lee Ji-Seok was sitting a while ago.There was silence between the two children.It would become trouble if they shoot like this, so Seojun talked to him first.\u201cHello, Hyung. I\u2019m Lee Seojun. I am attending first grade of elementary school.\u201dWhen Seojun greeted happily, the boy thought he was cute and smiled and greeted him back. Since he is already here, there\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Jung Si-Hyuk. I\u2019m in the 6th grade. I am part of the soccer club.\u201d\u201cSoccer club?\u201d\u201cYes. I want to become a soccer player when I grow up.\u201dSeojun recalled the script. It was a scene where children were playing soccer in the vacant lot and they gave the detective the number of a hit-and-run car. They even hired a real soccer child player for the shooting.\u201cHmm. Seojun. Do you want to play soccer? I\u2019ll teach you.\u201dNot long after sitting in the chair, Jung Si-hyuk looked itchy.He stood up and let go of the soccer ball with both hands. He couldn\u2019t keep his body still, he wanted to play soccer.Seojun nodded, however, he wondering if the ball would fly away and interfere with the filming.\u201cShall we?\u201d\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll ask my uncle!\u201dYoon Ji-Hyuk quickly ran toward a lighting staff. Aha.He seemed that he came through because there was someone he knew. Jung Si-hyuk ran with a bright face after having the permission granted.\u201cWe can play in the empty lot over there. Let\u2019s not go too far.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen Seojun stood from his chair, Yoon Sung-oh, who was looking after Lee Ji-Seok and Seojun alternately, approached.Because Lee Ji-Seok is currently filming, Yoon Sung-oh became Seojun\u2019s guardian.\u201cSeojun, where are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to play soccer with Si-Hyuk hyung in the vacant lot over there.\u201d\u201cReally? Then let\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201cWhat about you Ji-seok hyung?\u201d\u201cSince he is an adult, he\u2019ll do well on his own.\u201dThe two children headed towards the vacant lot with Yoon Sung-oh. The lighting staff, who was glancing their way, also focused on work again, relieved that an adult came with them.\u201cKick it inwards like this.\u201d\u201cLike this?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re good! Have you played soccer?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u2018I\u2019ve never played soccer, but I\u2019ve been a ball.\u2019[(First) Golden Seal\u2019s golden ball]Golden seals never remove their gold balls from their bodies.They can handle the ball freely.When handling the ball, the user\u2019s athletic ability would slightly be improved.The golden seal collects the shells of the golden eggs that he broke and made a round ball.They were a race that handled the ball better than anyone else because he carried a golden ball throughout his whole life.He would strike this golden ball with his tail to attack the enemy or seek food.\u2018There are no monsters playing soccer, but there were quite a few monsters playing ball.\u2019[Golden seal\u2019s golden ball will now be activated]It was fun for the soccer ball to stick to its feet like a magnet and move around according to its movement.He had kicked a soccer ball a few times before, but it was different compared to when he used his skills.Like a player who has been with the ball all his life, Seojun\u2019s skills have improved noticeably under the guidance of Si-hyuk. Yoon Sung-oh unknowingly applauded at his change.\u201cOkay! Pass this way!\u201dJung Si-hyuk was also excited. His uncle asked him to help him only once, so he came out without practicing, but the kid who would film with him did also a great job.Despite the difference in height, gesture, and pass, he took Jung Si-hyuk\u2019s ball well with a quick kick.Jung Si-hyuk, who was motivated by the appearance, started kicking his feet hard. The two children passed the ball to each other again when they got tired of the battle of stealing and losing.Jung Si-hyuk, who received Seojun\u2019s pass, smiled brightly and shouted.\u201cSeojun, is this really your first time? You\u2019re really good.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dSeojun laughed and kicked the ball. While playing like that, Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s filming was already over. The staff, who gathered to film in the vacant lot, admired the children playing.\u201cBoth of you are so good at this.\u201d\u201cSi-Hyuk is probably one of the top five elementary students in Korea when it comes to soccer. He came out for a broadcast last time. But I think actor Lee Seojun is really good, too.\u201dThe pass continued without a break, and sometimes they struggled to take the ball away from each other.Certainly, Jung Si-hyuk, who has a large physique, seemed to be doing it softly, but Seojun\u2019s skills could keep up with him.\u201cMay I add this?\u201d\u201cYes. Put this scene on the drama.\u201dDirector Choi Min-sung and writer So Eun-jin nodded.The camera rolled without the two children knowing, and Yoon Sung-oh moved away from the two children so that he could not be seen on the camera.The scene where the two children played ended quickly and was added for the drama.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was very different from his carnations with messy grass.Seojun was much prettier. He also wanted to give pretty flowers to his mom and dad.\u201cThis? It\u2019s pretty if you fold it and open it up.\u201d You have to fold it in half.\u201dWhen Seojun showed a demonstration and folded the petals, not only Ji-Yoon but also his friends who sat around him folded along.Before they knew it, the other children also flocked around Seojun.\u201cLike this?\u201d\u201cYes! You\u2019re good.\u201dThe teacher, who looked pleased with Seojun\u2019s mature appearance, rolled up her sleeves to help the children who failed to make their carnations.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll help you, too.\u201dSuddenly, the whole class helped each other and made pretty carnations.When the children were busy making carnations for their mothers and fathers, Seojun\u2019s hands moved busily.He folded the colored paper he bought with his own pocket money and cut it neatly \u2013 the teacher helped him \u2013\u00a0 he made a bag full of flowers.When he returned home from Taekwondo classes, his mom and dad were waiting for him.Seojun looked at the clock. It\u2019s not yet 6 o\u2019clock, but his father already returned from work.\u201cDad! You left work early\u201d.\u201cHmm.\u201dLee Min-Joon awkwardly at Seojun\u2019s words.It\u2019s Parents\u2019 Day, so he can\u2019t say he came early because he wanted to get carnations.Seojun, who guessed his father\u2019s mind, smiled and opened his navy school bag.\u201cThis is for my mom. This is for my dad!\u201dThere are now pretty handmade carnations on their hands together win an envelope for each.\u201cMom and dad. I love you!\u201dSeojun hugged the two people tightly. Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon blushed without realizing it.They put the carnations and letters on the floor and hugged Seojun back.\u2018Oh. My baby, when did he grow up so much?\u2019They would receive carnations and letters annually, but their hearts would still tremble every time.\u201cMom and dad love Seojun so much!\u201dSeo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon read the letter with carnations.The shy Seojun quickly went back into his room and brought out some boxes that he had prepared in advance.After reading the letter, his mom and dad were wiping away their tears.When Lee Min-Joon, who cleaned up his nose, took the carnation out from Seojun\u2019s bag and asked.\u201cSeojun, why did you make so many?\u201d\u201cThere are other people that I want to give the carnations!\u201dSeojun put carnations in a pretty box.They had fewer petals than his mom and dad\u2019s carnations, but it was still pretty.\u201cThis is for my grandmother and grandfather (Father side). This is my grandmother\u2019s. (Mother side) This is for Uncle Chan\u2019s. This is for uncle Hee-Sung. This is for Brown Black\u2019s. This is for my aunt. (Nara)\u201d This was all the carnations.Seojun took out another type of flower.\u201cI made this because I wanted to give it to other people, too.\u201dLee Ji-Seok and Yoon Sung-Oh. Choi Dae-man, Ryan Will, Jonathan, Evan Block, and Rachel Hill. It was a paper flower that he will be sending to people he was grateful for.Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-Joon laughed at the postcards and flowers put in the box.\u201cEveryone will love it.\u201dAfter sending boxes to people by mail, Seojun\u2019s cell phone rang one after another.Brown Black cried and said that they didn\u2019t know they would get this, and Kim Hee-Sung sent a bunch of dolls as a response.Other people also sent gifts, perhaps because they forgot to send gifts on Children\u2019s Day.It has been three weeks since \u2018Re-investigation\u2019 was aired. The \u2018Re-investigation\u2019 is airing at night, he was supposed to go to bed at 9 o\u2019clock, but he decided to watch the main broadcast today.It was now episode 5 of \u2018Re-investigation.\u2019 It was an episode where Seojun would appear as a cameo.\u201cIt\u2019s a little awkward to watch it on TV. I would usually went to the movie theater and watched it.\u201d\u201cI know. My parents are already watching KBC.\u201dThe couple and Seojun were also sitting on the sofa watching TV.They like the plot of the drama so they would watch it when it is aired, but at the episode where Seojun appeared felt different compared to movies.\u201cKBC even aired \u2018The Devil\u2019 on Sunday.\u201d\u201cUh. I\u2019m a little\u2026\u201dWhen Lee Min-Joon shuddered at the words \u2018The Devil\u2019, Seojun and Seo Eun-Hye burst into laughter.Unlike movie theaters, where they have to quietly focus on movies, dramas are what you watch at home so they can talk to each other comfortably.The ratings of the drama \u2018Re-investigation\u2019 were high.It had the highest ratings among other broadcasted dramas on Monday and Tuesday.Due to the high popularity on the Internet, there was also a Forum where viewers discussed the latest episodes.[Re-investigation Episode 5]-These days, Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s investigation seems to have improved.-Re-investigation is fun to watch.-The plot was fun, too.-Speaking of which, KBC had a lot of shows related to Lee Seojun.-Yes, they even bought 48 hours from WNET, and there was a re-run of Shadowman, and even The Devil was aired on the weekends. It\u2019s still fun to watch it again.\u2013 Definitely, TV is more impact than movies, so my friend, who only watched TV, was his first time watching Seojun. He watched \u2018The Devil\u2019 which aired this time and said he didn\u2019t know Seojun would act so well. So he will be watching Shadowman 1 and 2 as well.-Please tell us about \u2018Re-investigation!\u2019After many advertisements, the fifth episode of the \u2018Re-investigation\u2019 began.Around the middle of the fifth episode, a suspicious hit-and-run incident occurred, Lee Ji-Seok headed to the place of the incident to find more clues.\u201cHey! Let\u2019s pass this way!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dLee Ji-Seok, who was looking around the alley, heard the voices of the children.Following the voices, two children were playing with a soccer ball kicking in a wide-open space. The short child and the tall child were playing with the soccer ball freely.They played by stealing each other\u2019s balls. The older child pressed the younger child with his physique, while the younger child moved quickly.Despite the fierce physical fight, the soccer ball did not look like it would fly away as if a magnet was attached to the two children\u2019s feet and the soccer ball.\u201cThey\u2019re good\u201d.At Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s words, people who were watching television and also soccer games nodded.At that short moment, they felt like they watching a soccer game seriously.The head coach of a soccer team, who was watching \u2018Re-investigation\u2019, jumped up when he saw the scene.He was watching this episode in order to tease Jung Si-hyuk about it tomorrow, but the other child caught his attention.\u201cWho\u2019s next to Si-Hyuk?\u201d\u201cWell, I think he is an elementary school student based on his height\u201d.\u201cWhen I was his age I couldn\u2019t even do that\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe eyes of the soccer team coach who found a new prey, he recognized Jung Si-hyuk\u2019s talent early and attracted him to the soccer team, and he wanted to do the same with the child together with Si-Hyuk.Perhaps Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s appreciation was heard, so the two children stopped their feet and looked at Lee Ji-seok.Lee Ji-seok, who coughed to lighten the atmosphere at the sight of the children looking at him intensely, opened his mouth.\u201cDo you play soccer here every day?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe little child with missing front teeth said.Lee Ji-Seok and the viewers also smiled at the child\u2019s smart answer, even though he seemed naughty.The smiling viewers\u2019 expressions hardened. Initially the only saw his foot movements and physical fights that were not like any other children when it comes to soccer, but now they recognized his face.Seojun smiled brightly.\u201cDid you also come here yesterday?\u201d\u201cYes, but who are you?\u201dThe eldest child hid the small child behind his back.Whether he knew what his brother was thinking or not, the small child peeked at Lee Ji-Seok with curious eyes.\u201cI am a police officer, and there was a hit-and-run accident that happened near here. I am investigating that. This is the only way out. Didn\u2019t you see a strange car passing by yesterday?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t saw it\u2026\u201d\u201cI saw it!\u201dThe little kid replied quickly. The eldest child sighed. He remembered that his brother had been talking about a strange car last night.\u201cHe was driving strangely. He bumped into that street lamp and hit this wall.\u201d\u201cDid you see the number of the car?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 It was similar to my phone number\u2026. 4812 something. I don\u2019t know what are the numbers after that.\u201d\u201cOkay. Thank you.\u201dLee Ji-Seok nodded. And he left the alley to continue investigating the hit-and-run car.After the fifth episode of the \u2018Re-investigation\u2019, the ending song went up and a white caption appeared on the screen with the child smiling.[Thank you to Lee Seojun and Jung Si-Hyuk for making a special appearance]-???

I\u2019m An Daho and I am 25 years old.\u201dAn Daho, who has a fairly solid physique, bowed.He thought his boss would take him somewhere related to work, but it was actually actor Lee Seojun\u2019s house.Actor Lee Seojun, who even filmed a Hollywood movie, seemed to live in a large detached house in a rich neighborhood, but he was actually living in an ordinary apartment in an ordinary neighborhood.Seo Eun-Hye and Seo Eun-chan laughed at the appearance of An Daho, he was very disciplined.Seojun also looked at An Daho, who would be his manager.Whether it was coincidence or fate, there were many good people around Seojun.His neighbors, who live in the same apartment as Seojun, did not spread rumors that he lived here.The kindergarten parents were satisfied with just autographs and photos.It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s really a coincidence, but if it\u2019s the influence of his ability, Seojun couldn\u2019t predict what effect it would it bring if he didn\u2019t possess one.Seojun\u2019s eyes look at him from head to toe. An Daho, who was sitting in his legs, straightened his shoulders and pop out his chest.Seojun, who was looking closely at his opponent like a cat, smiled. \u2018I think he is a good person.\u2019\u201cHello, Daho-hyung. My name is Lee Seojun.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you. Actor Lee Seojun. I\u2019m An Daho.\u201dWhen Seojun reached out his small hand, An Daho\u2019s eyes fluctuated greatly.He couldn\u2019t tell it to Seo Eun-chan, the president, otherwise he would be fired but An Daho was a fan of Seojun.Two years ago, when he watched William at the movie theater, An Daho cried even after leaving the theater.During these years he worked hard in order to support his single mother who raised him. At that time, he had a dream of supporting an actor who acted like him.After that, he studied how the entertainment industry worked and joined as a new manager and took charge of chores.He also tried acting as an extra because he was curious about how an actor works, but he made four NGs and quit.For the past two years, after wandering from place to place. He joined Cocoa Entertainment.Since there was only Brown Black, and the next trainees that seemed to debut as an idol group, An Daho, who wanted to handle actors, was looking for a new agency.At that time, a rumor started circulating inside the company.A rumor about actor Lee Seojun signing a contract with Cocoa Entertainment.He didn\u2019t believe it initially but it was actually true. After that, there was an announcement that the president was looking for a manager for Seojun.It was not openly announced, only among the employees of Cocoa Entertainment heard it.An Daho immediately submitted an application. And he passed. There were several candidates, but he was the one chosen.An Daho held Seojun\u2019s hand while trembling with excitement.Looking at him in person, he realized that he was still very young. Knowing that this child possesses a god-like acting skill, his respect for him increased even more.And now An Daho can help Lee Seojun in his journey to becoming a Superstar.\u201cI will do my best at serving you!\u201dAn Daho really meant it.Seojun felt An Daho\u2019s sincerity so he responded to him with a smile.Despite his fairly large physique, An Daho seems to burst his tears.\u201cSpeak comfortably! DAHO!\u201dWatching the two shake hands, Seo Eun-Hye tapped Seo Eun-chan in the side.\u201cYou seem to have a good eye in choosing good people.\u201d\u201cDaho tried to hide it, but it was obvious that he was a fan of Seojun. There\u2019s no one in our company who doesn\u2019t know about it.\u201dSeo Eun-chan sighed, thinking of the full reports from An Daho.When he asked him to select a few scripts suitable for Seojun and analyze them, An Daho analyzed almost all the scripts that were submitted and even made a summary of each of them.He was sure of it, this man can help Seojun in his career.\u201cI\u2019m just good at distinguishing capable people and he is really good at his work, he\u2019ll be a good manager.\u201dDo you want me to be serious and let you talk to Seojun on the phone? It was Andaho, who firmly refused, saying it was a nuisance even if he asked secretly.After the manager\u2019s introduction, I looked at the clock and it was time for Lee Min-joon to leave work. In order to meet Lee Min-joon, An Daho decided to eat at Seojun\u2019s house for dinner.The boss and Seo Eun-chan gave a day off for Anda-ho, who was caught not being able to leave work until late.Seo Eun-chan, who went grocery shopping on Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s errand, and An Daho was still sitting in his firm posture in the living room.He was at a loss on whether to help Seo Eun-Hye cooking in the kitchen or remain here and babysit Seojun.Seojun was answering his assignments from elementary school at the living room table. After a while, he initiated a talk with An Daho.\u201cAren\u2019t you bored?\u201d\u201cHuh? No. It\u2019s okay. Why? Want me to help you with homework?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dSeojun put down his pencil and headed to his room. Among the scripts stuck in the bookshelf, he choose scripts that he liked and wanted to give them to An Daho\u201cIf you\u2019re bored, read this.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dSeojun continued with his homework, and An Daho read the script.There seemed to be memos that Seojun have written himself.[I want to try this][I don\u2019t like this][The script and the movie are very different from each other][The Director was changed in the middle]An Daho took out his notebook to summarize the characteristics of the role Seojun wants to try and also the genre of the movie.He also wrote down the title of the script that he didn\u2019t like.\u2018I\u2019ll search them out when I get home.\u2019At Seojun\u2019s quiet house, the sound of a pencil and a slicing sound of a kitchen knife rang like music.Seojun was working hard on answering his homework. While stretching his neck, he saw An Daho.He seemed like a college student writing notes on his notebook while having a bunch of research papers on his desk.The door opened.\u201cI came back with brother-in-law.\u201dThe quietness didn\u2019t last long either.Seo Eun-chan and Lee Min-Joon opened the front door and entered.Seojun jumped up from his seat and ran towards Lee Min-Joon to hug him.Lee Min-Joon lifted Seojun with a big smile.\u201cI heard that your manager is here\u201d.\u201cYes! It\u2019s DAHO!\u201dAn Daho, who went stiff again because of nervousness, bowed.\u201cHello, I\u2019m An Da-daho.\u201d\u201cOh, hello. I\u2019m Seojun\u2019s dad, Lee Min-Joon.\u201dDinner began immediately as soon as Lee Min-Joon arrived.As always Seojun started talking about what happened at school, and the adults responded enthusiastically. Because of their heated interaction, Seojun didn\u2019t stop talking about what happened to him today.He colored many drawings, read in class, played soccer on the playground, and he even narrated what he did during musical classess.Seojun\u2019s chattering loosened An Daho\u2019s shoulders, he was extremely nervous and anxious meeting his idol and his parents. He even ate with them.After eating the dessert that Seo Eun-chan bought, An Daho and Seo Eun-chan left Seojun\u2019s house.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSeojun. He is more normal than you think, right?\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dAn Daho, sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat, nodded at Seo Eun-Chan\u2019s words as he grabbed the steering wheel.\u201cEven though Seojun is good at acting and smarter than his peers, he doesn\u2019t have to be burdened. You just have to take care of him like he is your younger brother. If you think it\u2019s dangerous, protect him. If Seojun wants to do something, listen to his reason. If you\u2019re in trouble, please contact me.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d\u201cHe has an uncle named Kim Hee-Sung\u201d.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHe knows Seojun very well. My brother-in-law and sister Seojun are his parents so they know his dislikes and likes, but in some fields there are somethings that they don\u2019t know about Seojun. As the manager, it would be better to get more advice from Hee-sung than from my sister and brother-in-law. I\u2019ll introduce him to you next time.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\u201cDaho.\u201dAn Daho replied to Seo Eun-chan immediately.\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cPlease take good care of Seojun.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye, Lee Min-Joon, and Seo Eun-chan said the same thing all day long.\u2018Please take good care of Seojun.\u2019An Daho deeply engraved in his heart the sentence and vowed to do his best in taking care of Seojun.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll do my best!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he saw an employee, he quickly came to his senses and headed towards the public relations team.Even though he used high-quality materials for soundproofing, phone ringing could still be heard beyond the wall.The day after the fifth episode of the \u2018Re-investigation\u2019 was aired, phones of Cocoa Entertainment have been ringing ever since. This was because Seojun\u2019s picture and his schedule were up on their website.Seo Eun-Chan took a deep breath and opened the door of the public relations team\u2019s office.As soon as the door opened, the sound of the phone ringing hit his eardrum.All the phones at work rang and emails were spamming the company\u2019s email.It was like a war zone.The employee who answered the phone shouted.\u201cExcuse me! This is MBS!\u201d\u201cThis is SBC!\u201dProduction companies from dramas and entertainment shows were contacting them.Before Seojun made an appearance as a cameo in \u2018Re-investigation\u2019, they already prepared themselves for incoming proposals but this was too much.From dramas that are currently being aired to dramas that have just barely gathered their actors, proposals from many different dramas were constantly coming in.All of these companies wanted to ride on Seojun\u2019s name even if he only appears for a few seconds.In addition, other than Production Companies, writers contacted them separately from their program.Employees who did not answer the phone browsed through the Internet.From KBC\u2019s website to a community with a large number of members. Articles about Lee Seojun continued to appear here and there.Even those who did not watch the movie knew the \u201cHollywood Child Actor, Lee Seojun.\u201d When the news about Seojun being casted as a cameo in a drama, those who couldn\u2019t watch the episode, watched the re-run.\u201cReplay ratings and replay views are higher.\u201d\u201cTo catch many viewers, KBC is re-running episodes 1 to 5.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a comment asking if Seojun is going to appear again.\u201d\u201cHow many comments did want him to play soccer?\u201dAmong them, there were people who watched \u2018Re-investigation\u2019 and looked for the movies where Seojun appeared.There were also people who watched \u2018The Devil\u2019 aired on KBC during weekend and \u2018Re-investigation\u2019.Broadcasters were also busy with the increasing public interest. Their phones were constantly ringing out.Kim Soo-Ryeon, head of the public relations team, raised her voice.\u201cWhat should we do? Excuse me!\u201dSeo Eun-Chan scratched his cheek.\u201cFirst of all, reject all the dramas.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAfter answering the phones, the employees look up.\u201cHe is not filming a drama?\u201d\u201cWill he be filming a new movie?\u201d\u201cHollywood?\u201d\u201cKorea?\u201dAs the employees\u2019 questions piled up, Seo Eun-Chan spoke again.\u201cActor Lee Seojun wants to act in a play.\u201dAt those words, a man who came to find Seo Eun-chan, stopped his track while holding a stack of white papers.Lee Seojun\u2019s manager, An Daho, had read all the scripts of dramas and movies suitable for Lee Seojun in the past two weeks and even wrote reviews and summaries so Seojun could easily choose one.Seo Eun-chan turned his head to the sound of something falling. He saw An Daho standing at the entrance of the public relations team\u2019s office.Seo Eun-chan smiled at him and opened his mouth as An Daho looked at him with a confused look.\u201cThat\u2019s great, Daho. You came in the right timing.\u201dAn Daho, nodded reflexively at the president\u2019s words.* * *Although Seojun was entrusted to Cocoa Entertainment, Lee Min-Joon and Seo Eun-Hye still want to be involved with Seojun\u2019s career.Seojun and his mom browsed the Internet together.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\u201cOnly over 10 years old here.\u201dThere were few plays featuring children. It was rare to find children acting for plays, and there was also the height and age limit.In particular, Seojun has been unable to write an audition application due to age restrictions of being 8-years-old.\u201cSeojun, do you want to really act in a play?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe play he watched with Ji-Seok was impressive.The close audience seats where he can even hear the breathing of the actors acting right in front of him.The small theater was stuck in Seojun\u2019s heart.\u201cActing so close to the audience\u2026 I want to do that, too.\u201d\u2018How will people react to my acting in person?\u2019Unlike the staff watching them during filming, he wanted an audience that would watch and focus only on his acting without editing or thinking about the box office success.Movies and dramas are good, but he really wanted to see vivid and direct reactions of the audience with his own eyes.Just thinking about it made his heart pound.Seo Eun-Hye rolled up her sleeves at Seojun\u2019s sparkling eyes.\u201cI see. Shall we look for more?\u201dSeojun searched the Internet on his cell phone and Seo Eun-Hye on her laptop.This was what Seojun has been doing for the past few days.After coming home from the academy, he does his homework first and then browses the internet.Sometimes, Daho would come and hand over the script. Read them and shake his head. Daho was really working hard, he can now choose a script without reading the whole script because of Daho\u2019s summaries.After An Daho left, Seojun spoke to his father with a sulky face. Lee Min-Joon lowered the sound of the television.\u201cWhen can I do this? I want to act in a play!\u201d\u201cIt may take time. Seojun you are still too young.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But by then I will lose interest in plays.\u201d\u201cReally? Then why don\u2019t you make your own play?\u201d\u201cMy own?\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes got bigger. His own play?Lee Min-Joon said it half-joking, but his words were deeply imprinted in Seojun\u2019s heart.Seojun had plenty of money in his bank account, he was close to famous actors, and great directors. All he needs is just a good story.Seojun blinked.\u2018Huh? I really think I can do it.\u2026.\u2019\u201cIsn\u2019t that the play that Seojun watched together with Ji-Seok before?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSeojun\u2019s thoughts stopped at what his father said. Lee Min-Joon raised the volume as Seojun\u2019s interest turned toward the television.[Actor Lee Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok who watch \u2018My Neighbor\u2019!][Interview with Wind Theater Company]A short video appeared on the news segment for the entertainment industry. Kim Sun-Gon, the head of the Wind Theater, appeared on the screen with the backdrop of a stage larger than the small theater that Seojun attended before.[How\u2019s the new theater?]-Everyone feels awkward because it\u2019s their first time acting on such a big stage, but they\u2019ll be able to adapt soon.[Tell us about the play and \u2018My neighbor\u2019]-My Neighbor is a human comedy play that is made by people\u2019s misunderstanding and delusion.[What would be your next work?]A short interview about the play followed, and he narrated how Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok came to watch the play.No more questions about the play followed that as the next questions were all about either Seojun and Ji-Seok, Kim Sun-Gon\u2019s eyes briefly darkened.Seojun, who was watching television, hurriedly took out his cell phone and contacted Lee Ji-Seok.After a few rings, so Lee Ji-Seok answered the phone.\u201cSeojun? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cDid you watch TV?\u201d\u201cTV? No. Why?\u201d\u201cThe Wind Theater Company appeared on TV, but they don\u2019t look good.\u201dThe couple quietly left the living room wondering what was going on. It was better to leave this to veteran actor Lee Ji-Seok.Lee Ji-Seok searched for his laptop at Seojun\u2019s words.\u2018Is it entertainment news if a theater company comes out?\u2019 While searching, he already had a hunch over what was going on.\u201cSeojun.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dBut, his expression wasn\u2019t good.No one was as sensitive as actors who acted with facial expressions, so Seojun noticed tiredness from Kim Sun-Gon\u2019s expression.\u201cI told you last time, right? If they promote it under our name, bad things will follow.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeojun sat on the sofa and listened to Lee Ji-Seok.\u201cWe watched the play back in April. It\u2019s June now, right? For almost two months, they must have answered more questions and stories about the two of us than their own works. Even if the audience thinks it\u2019s their first time asking such questions, how hard it must be for them to continue answering the same questions over and over again. It was not even a question about their work.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd Kim Sun-gon, the leader, made this choice.\u201d\u201cChoice?\u201d\u201cYeah. Rather than putting his work as the main character, he wanted to succeed by putting our names forward. He like plays, but he needed money to continue the play. Did it a work? Was it successful? That\u2019s how he made his choice\u201d\u201cUntil when will they feel bad?\u201dLee Ji-Seok smiled at Seojun\u2019s concern.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. People\u2019s interest changes in an instant, so it won\u2019t last long.\u201dLee Ji-Seok read the comments and closed his laptop. Unlike the first day, which was sold out in 30 minutes, there were sparse rumors that tickets were sold out.As the number of audiences gradually decreased, Kim Sun-Gon, the general manager, would need to appear in a broadcast interview.The timing of the interview request was good and he immediately grabbed the opportunity.Now, the general public who watched the broadcast may have already watched the play and will ask questions about Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok again, thus revealing his feelings for a while.Seeing that there is nothing much to say on the entertainment news forum, it seems that only Seojun noticed it.\u201cI like your eyes.\u201dLaughing, Lee Ji-Seok continued.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Looking at the fact that they are still Playing My neighborhood, I think they can still go on. If it was really hard, they would have started a new work. What people are interested in is the play we\u2019ve watch.\u201dAt Lee Ji-Seok\u2019s words, Seojun replied thank you and hung up the phone.Those words remained in Seojun\u2019s head.They have always received attention so far, but they knew that they weren\u2019t the main character. They felt a little tired regardless of their love for acting.The situation, not the main character, slowly forgot their love for acting.Who can comfortably concentrate on acting in a situation where they cannot even receive attention and are hidden by others\u2019 shadow?Will they still be able to like acting?They will start blaming themselves and eventually quit acting.Wouldn\u2019t a person who really loves acting be a person who can still act until the end even in such a situation?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeojun\u2019s search for his next work continued.\u201cYou don\u2019t have any lines for this. What do you think?\u201dSeojun tilted his head at the question of An Daho. Although there were no lines for the child actor, it was a popular play last year.\u201cHmm. Is there anything else?\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s find others.\u201dAt Seojun\u2019s words, An Daho immediately put down the script. An Daho sighed inside.There were not many plays with child actors, but will there be a play that eventually Seojun would like?\u2018I need to tell the company to look for more.\u2019Seojun and An Daho sat next to each other and looked through the scripts diligently.After a while, the doorbell rang.Seojun was about to get up, but An Daho got up instead and headed to the intercom.The conversation continued for a while, and the front door opened.\u201cUncle Hee-sung!\u201dKim Hee-sung went to visit him.Seojun smiled and welcomed Kim Hee-sung. Kim Hee-sung reached out his hand to An Daho, while carrying Seojun.An Daho quickly held and shook his hands.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Seojun\u2019s uncle, Kim Hee-sung. You\u2019re Seojun\u2019s manager, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m actor Lee Seojun\u2019s manager, An Daho. I look forward to your kind cooperation!\u201d\u201cPlease take good care of Seojun.\u201dThey met without Seo Eun-chan\u2019s intervention, was he lucky?After the greetings, Kim Hee-sung sat on the floor of the living room familiarly, while Seojun and An Daho sat in their seats.\u201cWhat brought you here, uncle?\u201d\u201cI was wondering if you have a new design.\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ll bring my sketchbook!\u201dSeojun gave Kim Hee-sung a sketchbook full of monster drawings and played with him from time to time.Kim Hee-sung slowly browse the sketchbook, while Seojun and An Daho began reading the script again.\u2018This is unbelievable!\u2019Seojun\u2019s drawing skills improved day by day.The pictures were so realistic that they could be already used for a product design presentation.After he looking at the picture again, he looked up. He saw the other two people immersed in reading scripts.Certainly, browsing pictures was faster than reading.Kim Hee-sung, who finished his work in just 10 minutes, took one of the scripts from the pile and asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Drama or movie?\u201d\u201cNo, they are scripts for plays!\u201d\u201cA play?\u201dKim Hee-sung tilted his head and brought the script closer to read it.After turning a few pages, there were lines highlighted.\u2018Even if this are for plays, can I read them?\u2019\u201cThis are the child actor\u2019s part, right? There are only few lines.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, as long as I like the script I would do it.\u201dAfter an hour of sitting and reading, Seojun put his head down on the table while, his hands and eyes were still facing the script.\u2018Sigh. Ah, what should I do? When will I find a better script?\u2019Kim Hee-sung, who was reading the script, shrugged and picked up his cell phone.\u201cIs there any notice posted on the internet?\u201d\u201d\u201cYeah. I would always browse with my mom, but they are age limit. Daho-hyung already found plays for me that has no age limitations.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. Team 2 helped me chose popular plays where Seojun could act and without age limitations.\u201dAt An Daho\u2019s words, Seojun, who was drooping, and Kim Hee-sang, who was searching on his cell phone, turned their heads towards him and looked at his face.An Daho was surprised and went restless by the gaze of the two people looking at him.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d\u201cPopular?\u201d\u201cPopular?\u201dAt the words of Seojun and Kim Hee-sung, An Daho knelt down without realizing it. Cold sweat flowed behind his back.He replied while stuttering.\u201cYes. For actor Lee Seojun\u2019s filmography, we have collected plays that are likely to become successful. Considering all the conditions, including good actors, famous directors, and famous writers\u2026\u2026.\u201dAn Daho slowly lowered his voice towards the end. Something seems wrong.\u201cI see.\u201dSeojun looked at the script he had already read three times.He realized that there were many remakes of previous plays or translations of famous foreign plays.Kim Hee-sung laughed at An Daho, who went restless at Seojun\u2019s droopy appearance.He didn\u2019t seem to know anything about Seojun yet.\u201cDAHO, what did the boss say?\u201d\u201cThe boss? Because Seojun wanted to act in a play, he told me to find suitable scripts and send it over.\u201dIt was not wrong, but it seems Seo Eun-chan\u2019s explanation was insufficient.Perhaps the Team w, which is dedicated to actor Lee Seojun, wanted a box office hit like Shadowman 1, The Devil, and Shadowman 2.Well, even if it was Kim Hee-sung, he wouldn\u2019t want something that could ruin Seojun\u2019s Filmography.\u201cI don\u2019t care about box office hits. Daho-Hyung.\u201dAn Daho was surprised and looked at Seojun.\u201cI want to do what I want to do rather than having a box office hit. So please give me all the scripts that I want next time.\u201dUpon hearing Seojun\u2019s words, An Daho replied sullenly.\u201cOkay. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo! You don\u2019t have to be sorry! I just want to act in various roles regardless of box office success. But of course, please don\u2019t include scripts that you think would fail.\u201d\u201cWhat about this?\u201dKim Hee-sung intervened between the two apologizing to each other.Colorful announcements was on the mobile phone screen.An Daho\u2019s gaze became gloomy.\u201cIt\u2019s a play for only children and teen actors. There are no adult actor, and the performance would only during the summer vacation. Also, age doesn\u2019t matter either.\u201d\u201cI saw that too, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a play that Seojun would be in\u2026.\u201d\u201cUncle, do you have the script?\u201d\u201dAt Seojun\u2019s words, An Daho saw Seojun\u2019s eyes sparkle.\u2018It really has nothing to do with box office success?\u2019 An Daho\u2019s eyes were quite confused.\u201cIt\u2019s up here. Look at the amount of lines and characters. You can even write down the roles you want play on the application form.\u201d\u201cUncle, pick one for me!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dKim Hee-sung familiarly headed to a printer installed on at the corner of the living room. Seojun stood next to Kim Hee-sung and waited for the script to be printed out quickly.An Daho felt out of place.While working in the entertainment industry, he met many actors who were always looking for works that seemed to be a big hit.If a famous actor appears, a plus.And if a new actor appears, a minus.If a good director directs a plus.And if a new director directs a minus.Neither the writer nor the production company were different.The same thinking was true for Cocoa Entertainment\u2019s second team.Everyone thinks like that so they only looked for scripts full of Plus.But was this kind of play okay too?\u2018Unpredictable\u2019The script was soon printed out from the printer.As soon as the script came out, Seojun read the script one by one while standing.He reached out and collected the paper from the printer one by one, but he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the script.Kim Hee-sung sat down with a satisfied face.At the natural appearance of the two, An Daho hesitated and opened his mouth.He could see why President Seo Eun-chan said he would introduce him to a person named Kim Hee-sung.\u201cSi-sir..\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat should I do to support Seojun from now on?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThat was a good question.Kim Hee-sung knew something on Seojun\u00a0 that the couple would never understand.\u201cFirst of all, Seojun doesn\u2019t do anything he doesn\u2019t want to do. But if there is something he wants to do, he will push through and never give up.\u201dKim Hee-sung recalled his past eight-month experience with Seojun.Despite the frustration of failing to have a villainous acting he never gave up and eventually achieved it in the end.He really admired Seojun\u2019s dedication.\u201cOnly a few people know this story, but Seojun practiced only one script for eight months before shooting Shadowman 2.\u201d\u201c8 months?\u201dAn Daho\u2019s eyes got bigger.\u201cYes. That happens if Seojun want to do something. Also Seojun don\u2019t care about box office success. If he likes it, he will do it.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dRight now, he thought he should let team 2 stop looking for box office script.An Daho took out his cell phone.\u201cWell\u2026If you excuse me, I will just make a phone call\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, It\u2019s fine\u201dThen he went to a corner and made a phone call.Team 2 that heard the story from An Daho and sighed.Their CEO didn\u2019t inform them the most important thing!\u2018First of all, except for the ones that I think I\u2019ll fail\u2026\u2026 No, I will send everything except for works that have problems with the director or the production company.\u2019\u2018He will accept a children\u2019s musical too? Then we will search for it!\u2019The team 2 became noisy again, while Seo Eun-chan, who was in the president\u2019s office, felt his ears becoming itchy.\u201cI want to do this!\u201dSeojun, who had read the whole scripts, raised his head with an excited face.An Daho immediately took out his notebook, and Kim Hee-sung asked Seojun some questions while eating the snacks he bought.\u201cReally? What role do you want?\u201d\u201cBlue dragon!\u201d\u201cBlue dragon?\u201dUnlike An Daho, who tilted his head, Kim Hee-sung nodded.Seojun\u2019s face, regained excitement.Kim Hee-Sung thought about Seojun, who would always be with some monster dolls ever since he was a baby.Perhaps, the source of Seojun\u2019s acting skills was when he was playing with his monster dolls. Back then he would usually perform puppet show with the dolls he gifted him.\u201cI knew this day would come someday. I thought I\u2019d only act in Hollywood fantasy movies, but I can\u2019t believe this day has already come.\u201dSeojun excitedly talked about the plot. An Daho focused on listening to Kim Hee-sang and Seojun, but he was quite confused on why the Blue Dragon.\u201cYou\u2019re not the main character. It has an impact, but I think the amount of lines is less compared to the other roles.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is good.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dAn Daho\u2019s eyes turned towards Kim Hee-Sung.Kim Hee-Sung smiled and nodded.An Daho\u2019s face brightened up at Kim Hee-sung\u2019s heads up.\u00a0He\u00a0acted\u00a0as\u00a0though\u00a0he\u00a0were\u00a0his\u00a0superior,\u00a0mentoring\u00a0him.\u201cOkay.

They would usually organize musicals and plays in a fairly large concert hall in Seoul.\u201cChildren\u2019s play. There are many children who want to act, but they have no stage were to act, so they created this type of play that would only happen every summer. It\u2019s their first time trying it, so they will only accept applications from experienced child actors for now.\u201d\u201cI see! I can do it!\u201d\u201cIt may be difficult to practice because it is not a free play, you are the one paying to act. Also, the role may change in the middle of practice depending on the actor\u2019s competence. It is recommended that inexperienced actors should apply for roles with fewer lines.\u201dOther than that, there were all kinds of Notice.From physical problems to being able to follow instructions.\u00a0In\u00a0any\u00a0case,\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0still\u00a0something\u00a0that\u00a0parents\u00a0would\u00a0be\u00a0okay\u00a0with.\u00a0They can also watch the practice at any time, but it was impossible to intervene during practice.\u201cIt\u2019s literally a play where children are the main characters.\u201dMain character.\u201cDaho-Hyung.\u201dAn Daho, who was reading the Terms of Conditions, look at Seojun with a confused face.\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhy? Seojun?\u201dDespite the comfort words from Kim Hee-sung and An Daho, Seojun shook his head silently.* * *Seojun sighed. Ji-Yoon tilted her head at the sight of Seojun.\u201cSeojun, are you sick?\u201d\u201cNo. I am just thinking of something.\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201dJi-hoo and Ji-ho, who were sitting in front of him turned around and asked.

If it is me, I\u2019ll be so happy!\u201dAt Ji-Yoon\u2019s words, the children said they would like it.\u201cHmm. Ji-hoo. Ji-ho.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat if people only like Ji-hoo?\u201dJi-ho, who quickly became emotional at his words, cried.\u201cWhat?

I hope people would like the play even without me in. But I\u2019m worried that it\u2019ll be hard because I\u2019m too famous.\u201dThe children seemed to understand halfway.\u201cThen what should I do?\u201d\u201cWhat should I do to make them like not only me?\u201dThey were just children who thought of a solution for Seojun.\u00a0Even\u00a0in\u00a0class,\u00a0they\u00a0were\u00a0mulling\u00a0about\u00a0a\u00a0solution,\u00a0but\u00a0as\u00a0soon as school ended,\u00a0they\u00a0put\u00a0it\u00a0all\u00a0aside\u00a0and\u00a0got\u00a0ready\u00a0to\u00a0go\u00a0to\u00a0Seojun\u2019s\u00a0home\u00a0with\u00a0anticipation..The school is only half-day for today so the children could hang out with friends.They\u00a0opted\u00a0to\u00a0stay\u00a0inside\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0rain.\u00a0Seo Eun-Hye came to pick up the children by car.\u201cI brought a toy!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t bring any. I guess I forgot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll lend you mine!\u201dSeojun decided to put aside his worries and play with them for about a day.The children ate snacks, played with each other, and took a nap. After waking up they played again and it quickly became evening.Seo Eun-Hye was worried about Seojun after hearing about what had happened yesterday, Lee Min-Joon left work early with the same worries as his wife.He arrived home together with Kim Hee-sung.They\u00a0breathed\u00a0a\u00a0sigh\u00a0of\u00a0relief\u00a0when\u00a0they\u00a0saw\u00a0Seojun\u2019s\u00a0beaming with\u00a0smile.The children sat side by side and watched television. They were watching a popular cartoon that is currently being broadcasted now.\u201cLet\u2019s go back home after watching this.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dEveryone replied in unison at Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s words.The three adults sat on the sofa and watched television.\u201cWe used to watch those cartoons back when we were children like them.\u201d\u201cRight. Wasn\u2019t there an old version of that cartoon?\u201dAs they were watching the cartoon, the opponent suddenly bounced out from the stadium.Now the wall crumpled while the opponent fainted.\u201c?!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dUnlike adults who were surprised, the children cheered, saying that the main character won.\u201cWhen we were young, the opponent wasn\u2019t punched out to the point of breaking the hall. He would either step back out of the ring or give up.\u201d Kim Hee-Sung grumbled.\u201cI know. Nowadays, opponents either are in the worst state or put to the hospital\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought my heart was going to drop.\u201dAfter that, the next opponents either give upHowever, the three adults spoke with serious expressions as opposed to youngsters who applauded for the main character\u2019s winning streak.\u201cIsn\u2019t it too easy? It feels like my heart is falling every time the opponent is massacred.\u201dThe cartoons in their memories are quite different, the main character usually cried if defeated and return stronger.\u201cIs this a generation gap?\u201dThe adults went silent.The main character advanced to the finals. The other person was wearing a mask. In Seojun\u2019s eyes, no matter how much he looks at it, he looked like someone.\u201cIs he a Ray?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Ray!\u201d\u201cIs Ray a villain?\u201dIt was Ray, the main character\u2019s friend.However, neither the main character nor the main character\u2019s friends nor the people in the audience noticed.In addition, Ray\u2019s name in the competition was different.X.It was the appearance of a new villain. After the introduction of a new villain, the episode ended. Parents, of Seojun\u2019s friend, went to their house to pick up their child.\u201cIt was so much fun!\u201d\u201cHis name is X! The name is so cool!\u201dThe children followed their parents home while chattering to each other. Seojun waved his hand as he sent them off.For dinner, they ordered jokbal. (TL: Braised Pig\u2019s trotters)Seojun skillfully put a piece of meat on lettuce, salted shrimp, and pickled onions. He ate it in one bite.\u201cDelicious!\u201d\u201cReally? Eat more.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun headed to the bathroom to brush his teeth after finishing his delicious jokbal.Seojun squeezed the toothpaste on his toothbrush and brushed his teeth,\u201cAhh!\u201dThe three people who had been paying attention to Seojun all day came running to him quickly.\u201cWhy, why, Seojun!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dUgh! Seojun, who spat out the foam, smiled brightly.\u201cI got an idea!\u201dAdults followed Seojun, who rinsed his mouth and excitedly headed towards the living room.The three people sitting side by side on the sofa looked at Seojun and waited for him to speak.\u201cCan I hide my name?\u201d\u201cName?\u201dName? The three people tilted their heads. Why hide his name all of a sudden?\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your name?\u201dSeojun looked at the three people\u2019s faces and realized that he may have worded his thoughts wrong.They must have thought he didn\u2019t like Seojun as a name and wanted to change it. In reality, he just wants to hide his name with an alias like X, Ray\u2019s friend did.Seojun quickly explained what he thought.\u201cWell, children\u2019s play\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0play\u00a0in\u00a0which\u00a0only\u00a0children\u00a0take\u00a0part.\u00a0Everyone would want to act cool and get attention, but if I participate, most of the audience will only come to see me.

If they wanted a guaranteed box office, they\u2019d cast well-known idols.Seojun could submit an audition application casually and be immediately hired.But this was a play for children.Despite the fact that they would cast kid actors in their first Children\u2019s plays, they were not as well-known as Seojun.Every child who applied to the Milky Way Troupe would want to be the main character and receive attention.As a result, Seojun became discouraged and eventually gave up.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d The three also nodded. It was obvious what would happen if it was promoted under Seojun\u2019s name.People would say: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing Seojun\u2019s acting right in front of my eyes.\u201dShadowman fans especially those who pity William or Jin Natra would definitely watch him.To experience Seojun\u2019s vivid acting in front row!\u201cI know. Isn\u2019t it possible for me to apply using a different name?\u201d\u201cRay\u201d and \u201cX\u201d flash across Seojun\u2019s memory.The individuals in the cartoon did not identify him despite his name change and mask.It\u2019s not just in cartoons. This is a common occurrence in films and other entertainment programs.\u201cYou want me to use an Alias.\u201d\u201cAn alias?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a fake name.\u201d\u201cYes! An alias!\u201dKim Hee-sang \u2018tsked\u2019 his tongue in response to Lee Min-Joon and Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s statements.\u201cSeojun is well-known in South Korea. What\u2019s the point of using an alias?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Aren\u2019t you going home? What time is it now?\u201d\u201cAh hahaha. A stage name it is. Stage name. Many celebrities also use stage names.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye stopped complaining, and Kim Hee-Sungng smiled awkwardly.Stage name!Seojun had a gleam in his eyes.***The next day.Regardless of the box office success, An Daho welcomed Seojun, who quickly went to school and extra classes, and carried a large number of scripts and synopses with him, allowing him to discern between difficult and not-so-problematic works.\u201cThis is what we picked out.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you! By the way, Daho.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSeojun slowly brought up the story his mother, father, and Hee-sung had with his uncle last night.\u00a0 An Daho nodded politely and paid close attention to what was being said.\u201cSo I thought it\u2019d be nice to go with a stage name.\u201d\u201cStage name?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAn Daho scratched his head. He was proud of Seojun for thinking about the children he would appear with.But as an actor\u2019s manager, An Daho should be the one who attentively considers difficulties and solutions.\u201cIt is not a problem, but do you want to do it, Seojun?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s submit the application under your real name. You will pass anyway so everyone would still see Seojun\u2019s face. The people over there should know who you are.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cShould we write the application form together now?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAn daho unfolded his laptop, and Seojun sat next to An daho.The venue for the children\u2019s play was the Milky Way Center, which is one of the largest theaters in Seoul, it would be a test site for child actors this year.Perhaps because it was his first attempt, he also received child actors who appeared in TV or movies.After the deadline for applications had passed, the first round of document evaluation commenced.More children and parents applied than expected, so an employee went to inquire and many people is actually aiming the position of \u201csecond Lee Seojun.\u201dThanks to the gathering of employees from other teams, the document review, which had been conducted without any problems, was overturned by just an application.Director Park Ji-soo, in charge of the direction, was still in shock.\u201cI can\u2019t believe he want to have an stage name for Blue Dragon role, where only his voice would come out.\u201d\u201cWhat should we do, Director?\u201dDirector Park Ji-soo, who was looking down at the application with a frowned face at the question of the supporting director, raised her head.\u201cFirst of all, he\u2019ll audition. There is no reason why actor Lee Seojun cannot come out because we are not trying to make money from this play and it is a play for children. Besides\u2026.\u201dDirector Park Ji-soo looked at the history written on the application form.Shadowman 1.The DevilShadowman 2.Re-investigation, cameo.\u201cIf he is an actor with this kind of history, other children who act with you will learn something.\u201d* * *The audition day for the children\u2019s play [Spring] has finally started. Seojun headed to the Milky Way Center with An Daho.Seojun sat on the car seat and fastened his seat belt on his own. An Daho checked Seojun\u2019s seat belt before went to the driver\u2019s seat and sat down.Seojun asked, looking around the car that will be Seojun\u2019s foot in the future.The gleaming and silky appearance mesmerized him. \u2018It\u2019s a lot better than our car!\u2019\u201cDaho, is this a new car?\u201d\u201cYes, the president bought a new one for Seojun.\u201d\u201cWow.\u201dSeo Eun-chan and the staff of the second team gathered together to choose the strongest and safest car.\u00a0 Everyone was delighted and picked out a car when the boss told him not to worry about the money.Despite the fact that he wasn\u2019t going to drive it alone, just looking through the catalogs and picking out a vehicle gave him a sense of accomplishment.\u201cUntil when will I sit in the Kids\u2019 seat?\u201d\u201cSeojun, you\u2019re not 145cm tall yet, are you\u201d?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhen you grow up, you won\u2019t be able to sit on the Kids\u2019 seat anymore. There\u2019s still a long way to go for Seojun.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dSeojun nodded, rattling his feet.An Daho drove safely. Vehicles that tried to overtake them were deterred by Seojun\u2019s flashy ride and eventually slowed down.Seojun\u2019s car soon arrived at the Milky Way Center. Seojun sat quietly in the car seat until An Daho parked in the underground parking lot and opened the door.\u201cYou can put it down now.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dOnly then did Seojun untie his car seat belt and get out of the car at An Daho\u2019s words.Seojun and Andaho took the elevator to the first floor of the Milky Way Center.Ding dong~On the first floor.\u201cIt\u2019s not him.\u201dThe last day of the audition for the children\u2019s play [Spring] and the day of the audition for the role of Blue Dragon.Since earlier, the eyes of the employees who came to work have been fixed on the elevator. Each time they heard the familiar ding-dong, their attention was immediately drawn to that location.When the door opened, and they saw someone who looked like a child with their, they would lift their heads up looked at the child.If it is a girl with long hair, they would quickly notice that it is not him, but if they don\u2019t see the boy\u2019s face correctly, they would keep looking at the child.When an employee who is in charge of checking the children\u2019s names shook his head, everyone began to do their job again with disappointment.\u201cDoesn\u2019t the audition start now?\u201d\u201cWhen everyone comes we will start.\u201dEveryone stared at the elevator at the employee\u2019s words.Just in time, the elevator went down to the underground parking lot.He is now here!Ding-dong. It\u2019s on the first floor.Slowly, the elevator door opened, and the child and guardian appeared. The child\u2019s face was not seen by deeply pressing the baseball cap with a silver badge, but everyone guessed.The staff checking the number of people ran quickly.\u201cHe is more normal than you think, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Honestly, I thought Lee Seojun\u2019s aura would come out even if he just stood. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened before Shadowman 2.\u201cActor Lee Seojun?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAn employee who came to help with the audition tried hard to hide his nervousness and checked the list. And he handed over the number tag to Seojun.\u201cThis is the audition number. If they call your number later, you can come out in front.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dThe employee looked at An Daho and said. An Daho nodded.\u201cYou can go right after the audition.\u201d I\u2019ll let you know the results later.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cThis is where you are going to wait.\u201dThe staff showed An Daho and Seojun the props room, after that he guided them in front of a large door.A tightly shut door was opened by the staff. An enormous stage and large audience were seen behind the wide-open door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s why I will be changing them from time to time. In raws tilted his head is used constantly because the act of tilting the head signifies confusion. And the author describe more of the action than the confusion the person felt.\u201cYou will still be going to audition on the stage. For now, sit in any seat you would like seat and wait for the director to call you.\u201d\u201cOn the stage?\u201d\u201cYes. Shooting in Movies and acting on plays are different, you still need to experience acting on stage even if only the Blue Dragon\u2019s voice is needed. This is a test to see if you have stage fright. Also, you still need to coordinate with the others actor on stage and the behind-the-scenes staff.\u201dAt the words of the staff, An Daho and Seojun looked at the stage again. Well, if he were scared on the stage when there was no audience, he would not be able to stand on the stage when the audience was full.\u201cThen please wait a moment.\u201dThe staff left, Seojun and An Daho sat in a relatively hidden part. Children and guardians who came to audition in several places were seen.There was child crying while looking around the stage and the audience. Meanwhile, his guardian was comforting him.Another child was running around because he likes the large place and his guardian was just looking at his cell phone. There was also a child who was busy reading the script.Seojun, wearing a black baseball hat, was looking alternately between the audience and the stage.It was very different from the small theater where the Wind Troupe was Playing. The stage was spacious, clean, and there were many audience seats.There was also a little distance between the stage and the audience.\u2018Hmm. This is very different from what I initially thought.\u2019The stage that Seojun thought of was small enough to see the sweat of the actor even if it was bigger than the Wind\u2019s theater.An Daho saw Seojun\u2019s troubled expression and asked him.\u201cIs there anything you don\u2019t like?\u201d\u201cNo, the stage is bigger than I thought. I thought it would be smaller than this.\u201dAt Seojun\u2019s words, An Daho recalled that he went to the small theater of the Wind Troupe.\u201cA small theater-like from that small troupe?\u201d\u201cHuh? How did Daho know?\u201dAn Daho laughed. As a fan of Seojun, he watched \u2018My Neighborhood\u2019 play as soon as the picture of Seojun and Lee Ji-Seok was released.\u201cI watched that play, too. But you can\u2019t act in such a small theater.\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201dSeojun was confused at An Daho\u2019s words.Isn\u2019t it good that the audience could even see the chest of the actor breathing, see their sweat closely and hear their voice as if he was speaking to them face to face?\u201cIt would be dangerous for you to act in a very close stage from the audience. There might be people who would break into the stage during a play or throw something at you on the stage.\u201d\u201cThere people like that?\u201d Seojun\u2019s eyes went wide at An Daho\u2019s words.An Daho smiled bitterly. He was in the entertainment industry for only two years, but he saw every black handed things that happens.\u201cSo for safety, it\u2019s better to have the stage away from the audience.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeojun, who was looking between the auditorium and the stage with a sad face, raised his head and asked.\u201cWhat about the members of Wind Theater Company? Are they okay?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no big accident, but there could be some small incident. They are all adults, so they\u2019ll do better than Seojun.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dSeojun was relieved. He looked at An Daho.\u201cHow come you know it?\u201dWhen asked by Seojun, he answered without hesitation.\u201cThat\u2019s what managers do. I have to pay attention to what the actors don\u2019t usually look into. The Wind Troupe has a relationship with Seojun, and they are still a hot topic, so I should know about them.\u201dIt was amazing that he even knew the current situation of the Wind Troupe.Cocoa Entertainment Team 2 was watching what moves will Wind troupe do in order to prevent any damages that may happen to Seojun\u2019s name. Today, a text message arrived on An Daho\u2019s cell phone saying, \u201cThe Wind is fine!\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dSeojun did not know what is happening at Cocoa Entertainment so he just nodded.At that time, the lights among the audience were turned off. The stage became brighter, while the path to the stage lightly brightened up so that it was not dangerous to walk.[Hello.]The voice rang throughout theater. Both the children running around and the children reading the script looked at the stage. A woman was standing under the spotlight.(TL: it is confirmed here that the director is a woman so I will be using she. Ji-Soo is kind of gender neutral name so it was unknown if the author refers to a woman or a man.)\u201cI\u2019m Park Ji-Soo, director of Spring, a Children\u2019s Play.\u201dThe woman said hello. At first no one clapped, only Seojun. After a while, the whole theater rang a round of applause.\u201cThe audition for Blue Dragon will begin soon. Please stand by and wait until we call your number.\u201d\u201cDo the children have to go up there alone?\u201dWhen asked by a guardian, Director Park Ji-soo nodded and said.\u201cYes. Guardians will remain on their seats. Applicants will come on the stage alone and act out the lines in the script. Do you have any more questions?\u201dThe audience was quiet.Director Park Ji-soo nodded, went down the stairs, and sat in the front row.When Seojun went to see her from a far, other people went to sit beside Park Ji-soo. They are probably officials such as music directors, lighting directors, and assistant directors.\u201cCandidate 1, please come out.\u201dA sobbing sound came from somewhere at the words of Director Park Ji-soo.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You need to go in stage!\u201d\u201cNo! I\u2019m scared!\u201dHe was a child frightened by the large concert hall. He seemed anxious even before but he eventually burst into tears. His guardian soothed him with a restless face, but he remained still.\u201cThe first applicant?\u201d\u201cHold on! You said you wanted to be like Lee Seojun. Are you going to give up here?\u201d\u201cWho said I wanted to be like Lee Seojun? My mom is the one who said so!\u201dThe words of the child and the guardian rang throughout the whole quiet concert hall.Seojun and An Daho, who did nothing wrong with the two\u2019s words, flinched. Officials who knew who was auditioning today also flinched.\u201cDad is like that too! I told you I don\u2019t want it!\u201dEventually, the guardian left the concert hall with the child wailing loudly. Director Park Ji-soo sighed and lifted the microphone again.\u201cCandidate number two.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to do it either!\u201dThe naughty child, who was running around the concert hall earlier, ran bravely towards the door of the concert hall and got out.As if they had already expected, before leaving the hall, the guardians bowed their heads and apologized, and followed after the child.Officials were already accustomed to it after three days of auditions and all the staff continued without any interruption.\u201c3rd applicant, please come out.\u201dNo one even stood at the words of Director Park Ji-soo.The applicant seemed to have left without saying a word. Officials changed the application papers without shaking their heads.Of the 10 applicants, 6 went on the stage. Among them, three children memorized half of their audition lines.There was only one child who could even act. Although, his acting was also thanks to the guardian\u2019s hard work below the stage in guiding him.\u201cBlue Dragon. What\u2019s wrong with the applicants?\u201d\u201cI know. The other roles has still some children who acted seriously.\u201dEveryone who auditioned as the main character acted decent that resulted to the guardians almost fighting to each other for just the role.\u201cBecause the audience will not be able to see their faces. Who wants to act where only their voices comes out?\u201dOfficials who came up with the reasoning tried to sigh but saw the last application.\u201cHere it is.\u201d\u201cYes. All I need is this actor.\u201dDirector Park Ji-soo held the microphone.Employees who were counting the number of children outside the concert hall gently opened the door and sat in the audience.\u201cIs this okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. If not now, when would I be able to see Lee Seojun\u2019s acting in person?\u201d\u201cSunbae!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you the CEO?\u201dEveryone turned their heads at someone\u2019s words. The president of the Milky Way, who was contacted by the assistant director, quietly entered the concert hall and settled near the screening seat. After that, the other superiors also appeared.While Seojun was waiting for director Park Ji-soo\u2019s call, almost all the people who knew about actor Lee Seojun\u2019s appearing in the concert hall arrived.Unlike a while ago, when it was empty, the audience seats were now half-full, and unlike Seojun, who showed no sign of being famous, An Daho was able to confirm his actor\u2019s popularity and smiled without realizing it.Director Park Ji-soo looked and the audience and said, \u201cI think everyone is here.\u201d[Applicant no.11 please come out]It was now Seojun\u2019s turn.An Daho fixed Seojun\u2019s hair after taking his baseball cap.\u201cHey! I\u2019ll be back\u201d.\u201cYes, Seojun. Good luck!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun looks like he wanted to run toward the stage.\u201cDon\u2019t run!\u201dAt the words of An Daho, he slowed down.Everyone held their breath and looked at Seojun.Seojun stood on the stage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The music director kept nodding, together with the lighting director.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a child actor acting like that.\u201dStanding alone on the stage, Lee Seojun said the Blue Dragon\u2019s lines. Unlike the other children, he did not just stand still and act with his voice, but he also his facial expressions and gestures changed according to his lines.The way he walked it didn\u2019t seem to be coming from a human being. He looks like a real blue dragon morphed into a human child.No matter how good an actor was at acting, it was inevitably to feel awkward when playing a non-human role. In particular, when acting without any special makeup, the viewers will think it was weird.However, Lee Seojun was different. He didn\u2019t put on any makeup, but if people saw Lee Seojun\u2019s acting wouldn\u2019t feel any \u201chuman\u201d aura coming from him.The president\u2019s eyes became dreamy as he recalled Seojun\u2019s acting earlier.\u201cIf there is a real dragon, I think he would have that kind of feeling, gesture, and expression. Director Park. It\u2019s such a waste to let him just act with his voice. Everyone has to see him.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dDirector Park Ji-soo shook her head.\u201cThe actor must be informed too. Actors who can act at that level choose their favorite script. Lee Seojun liked the current script. If I change it carelessly, he might say he won\u2019t do it.\u201dThere are actors like that.Actors who intends to play only the \u201cscript\u201d he likes regardless of the amount or amount of lines.Having faith in one\u2019s acting, having enough money, and not in a hurry. An actor who can have a few years of gap in his filmography to find a script that he or she likes.The source of such actors\u2019 confidence was the public. They were confident that the public will be enthusiastic no matter what role they would play at any time.People who are like that are called Super star!\u201cLee Seojun is that level.\u201dEveryone nodded at Director Park Ji-soo\u2019s words.There was no one here who didn\u2019t know about Lee Seojun. The money Lee Seojun earns from his YouTube videos every year, the world-class recognition he has accumulated through acting in Marine\u2019s movies, and the popularity he will gain from entering the TV network, which begun as a cameo in \u2018Re-investigation\u2019.The President sighed.\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily because of the box office success. Just\u2026as a member of the theater industry, with his current abilities, this is such a waste. Actor Lee Seojun acting a small part is such a waste. I hope everyone knows actor Lee Seojun\u2019s ability.\u201d\u201cActor Lee Seojun said he would like to hide his identity anyway, so the current script is appropriate for his situation.\u201d\u201cOh, so that was the case.\u201dThe President didn\u2019t continue to probe the director anymore.\u201cHe is a very kind actor, but why do I keep feeling sorry for his role?\u201dThis play was not something he is doing for money, and it didn\u2019t even came to his mind to use Seojun\u2019s name. He just wanted everyone to watch Lee Seojun\u2019s acting face to face.Regardless of the president\u2019s regretful expression, Director Park Ji-soo brought up the main topic of the meeting.\u201cWhat about actor Lee Seojun?\u201d\u201cDue you think he fit for the play \u2018Spring\u2019?\u201d\u201cPassed.\u201dThe President said as he leaned on the chair at the words of Director Park Ji-soo.\u201cHmm. Shall we start with keeping the confidentiality of Seojun acting for the play?\u201d* * *Seojun was putting spoons on the table but suddenly he needed to scratch his ear. Lee Min-joon, who was putting a bowl containing soybean paste stew on the table, asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cMy ears are itchy.\u201d\u201cSomeone must be talking about Seojun.\u201d\u201cMust be.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye smiled and placed a golden-grilled hairtail on the table. The plump hairtail looked delicious.(TL: A fish thin but long.)Everyone sat in their seats.\u201cThank you for the food!\u201dLee Min-Joon took a hairtail to de-bone and put it above Seojun\u2019s rice. Seojun scooped up a spoon of rice and ate it with hairtail.\u2018Salty and savory hairtail!\u2019\u201cDelicious!\u201d\u201cIs it good?\u201d\u201cYes! Dad, I\u2019ll do it on yours this time!\u201d\u201cWill you?\u201dLee Min-Joon slowly taught Seojun how to de-bone hairtail.First, he remove both sides of the thorny hairtail with chopsticks. And he gently spread it over the large bones in the middle with chopsticks,\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re good!\u201d\u201cSeojun is good with his hands.\u201d\u201cPerfect!\u201dLong and white hairtail was perfectly de-bone.Lee Min-joon and his wife headed to the living room after filling their stomachs with delicious hairtail and soybean paste stew. They are now eating the dessert while sitting on the sofa.\u201cI auditioned, and the kids were crying.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThere was a silence in the living room for a while. Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon already heard it from An Daho, and they just quietly waited for Seojun to open his mouth.\u201cHis mom said, \u2018You said you wanted to be like Lee Seojun, right?\u2019 and the child cried and said he never wanted that.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon sat next to Seojun to hug him tightly. In the arms of his parents, Seojun felt warmth spreading in his heart.\u201cSeojun, that\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\u201cYeah. The child just hated the situation. The child wanted to do something else, but he must be so angry because his parents forced him to do it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u2018I know.\u2019It\u2019s not because of Lee Seojun, but he just said the name of the most famous child actor at the moment.Still, the fact that he had a slight impact on the child\u2019s misfortune was on his mind. And there will be people like that child in the future.Seojun dug deep into the arms of his mother and father. Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon pat Seojun\u2019s head.\u201cDoesn\u2019t Seojun love acting?\u201d\u201cYes. I love it.\u201d\u201cMom and dad love when you do things that your like. And your fans will also feel the same as us.\u201d\u201cSeojun. The more you becomes famous, the more you will affect people in some way. And you can\u2019t solve all the problems that may happen. That\u2019s something neither Redborn nor Shadowman can do.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cSo when you are having a hard time, think of people who like Seojun. You make them happy and they make you happy.\u201dHis mom and dad enumerated all their acquaintances that Seojun has met. There were also nicknames of fans who frequently post on Seojun\u2019s fan cafe.The names that come from the mouths of his mother and father with full of love, made Seojun\u2019s burden in his heart disappear like magic.\u201cHehehe.\u201dAs Seojun laughed, Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon smiled brightly.The living room wasn\u2019t gloomy anymore, and it became noisy due to Seojun\u2019s practice.When Seojun brought out a blue dragon doll from his room and began acting while holding the blue dragon.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon, who became the audience, applauded.He had lived with monster dolls since he was young, and he didn\u2019t expect to ever act in this role.To be honest, the couple already expectednl this to happen\u00a0 like Kim Hee-sung.Ever since he was a baby he would act like a monster through the dolls and he was really good at it.\u201cIs it okay for you that they would only hear your voice? Didn\u2019t you wanted to act in front of people?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay! Voice acting is also acting!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cHmm. It\u2019s a bit disappointing. But it\u2019s Blue Dragon!\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes shined excitedly thinking about the Blue Dragon.\u201cMovies and dramas with dragons or monsters are very rare. I would look like a human being even if I\u2019m a human being. There are quite a few movies but they are either animated. Also, there are not many on plays or musicals. I want to act in play, I also want to act more monsters role. If it\u2019s not for this drama, I will not know when will I be able to do it.\u201dThe future is unknown.There may be more monster roles than Seojun thought, or this could have been the first and last time.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to do this now.\u201dWhat was clear was that he wanted to play this role now, even if he acted only with his voice.\u201cYehey! This is going to be so much fun!\u201dIn the end, Seojun, who couldn\u2019t contain his excitement, hugged the Blue Dragon doll.Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon burst into laughter. Their son being so excited is so cute.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Guardians, who came with the children, also sat on a chair on one side and talked to each other.\u201cI heard this is a play supported by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism\u201d.\u201cYes. So a few reporters will come to take pictures of the children later. I heard that a civil servant from the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism would also come to visit.\u201d\u201cAh. But there aren\u2019t that many people, right?\u201d\u201cWhat, because of the audience? In the future your child will put this line of experience in his resume. Whether he will become an actor or decide to study, it will be a good external activity if it is a program supported by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.\u201dEveryone nodded at those words.\u201cBut\u2026 isn\u2019t a child missing?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I heard they picked 16 children.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be weird if he were late from his first day.\u201dAt that time, Director Park, staff, and several reporters came into the practice room. Both the children and their guardians, who were talking earlier, stood up awkwardly.Director Park Ji-soo first looked around the practice room before speaking.\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re going to take a group picture and then script reading. You don\u2019t have to pay attention to the camera during the reading.\u201d\u201cHey, director.\u201dChoi So-young, the oldest child in the play \u201cSpring,\u201d raised her hand.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI think one person is missing.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dDirector Park Ji-soo scratched her head and replied.\u201cThe actor who plays the role of the Blue Dragon cannot come today due to personal reasons, but he will definitely participate in the next practice. Shall we take a group photo together first? Let\u2019s take a picture together with the actors first and then the guardians together.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe children gathered together. Short children stood in front while the tall children stood behind.The camera held by reporters and the staff flashed.The children\u2019s first reading was better than the expectations of the reporters and the guardians, but it was worse than the expectations of the directors and the staff.Direct Park Ji-soo and the staff burst into laughter in their hearts at the sight of reporters response and to the guardians applauding continuously.That\u2019s right. This is normal. Lee Seojun was just too special.[Supported by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism][Practice in the Milky Way Center, (G)I-DLE\u2019s play \u201cSpring\u201d](TL: The raws has definitely (G)I-DLE written as it is in English, the author here wanted to portray media that uses other famous name in order to gain clicks. It is not referring to the kpop group. From the context of the reporter\u2019s title he wanted to say (G) means girl, I-DLE (Aideul) which means children but confusing it to a kpop group to gain clicks.)[\u201cSpring\u201d is a play about a girl\u2019s adventure\u2026\u2026.][First day of \u2018Spring\u2019 play practice Group photo.]The article of \u2018Spring\u2019, which only contained the children and guardians pictures, was buried among the other entertainment articles shortly after it was posted.* * *On the second practice day.Seojun arrived at the Milky Way Center early because he was planning to follow Director Park Ji-soo\u2019s plan, but he was waiting in the practice room next to the other children.Seojun looked a little nervous, unlike usual. An Daho opened the water bottle and gave it to Seojun.\u201cDo you want some water?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeojun sighed after taking a sip of the water as if he had finally eased his tension.\u201cWhy are you so nervous?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never met any other child actor before.\u201dHe knew it was too much for everyone to like him. Daho, his mother and father who heard his concerns comforted him.Something unintended could have happened. He couldn\u2019t solve all of those problems himself. Still, Seojun wanted to do his best for the happiness of himself and everyone.Everyone likes acting here, so he hope everyone could enjoy making this work together.\u2018How can we get along better?\u2019The staff checked the other room to see if everyone was already there.Seojun exhaled loudly to calm himself.It might look like he was cheating, but he started E.L.F.\u2019s Basic Breathing to win the children\u2019s favor.And from Seojun\u2019s body, the actor\u2019s aura, which everyone was curious about, began to emerge.The staff and An Daho flinched at what is happening around him.\u2018Is this how he start?\u2019It was completely different from Seojun\u2019s idea.\u201cThen, let me introduce the actor who will play the role of Blue Dragon.\u201dAt the same time as Director Park Ji-soo\u2019s words, the door of the practice room opened.At first, the people didn\u2019t recognize who it was. Soon, however, everyone realized who the child was walking toward Director Park Ji-soo.The child posses a smile that shines brighter than anyone else.Even Seojun, who was a little nervous at his first meeting with other actors of his age, really did his best to win their favors.With that warm, non-ordinary aura, everyone recalled someone they had seen at least once.\u201cLee Seojun!\u201dChoi So-young, who plays the main character of \u201cSpring,\u201d screamed without realizing it.The kids who watched Shadowman were like, \u201cWow!\u201dThey exclaimed loudly and their guardians were speechless.Children, who did not watch the movie, were also opening their mouths at the appearance of \u201cHollywood Star, Lee Seojun,\u201d which they had heard at least once on television.Seojun, who was sending out his actor\u2019s aura, stood in front of the children and bowed.\u201cHello! I\u2019m Lee Seojun!\u201d\u201cHello!\u201dAs if he were a teacher, he smiled brightly as he saw the children copying his words and gestures.Contrary to what he was worried about, everyone welcomed him without any other violent reaction.His heart pounded as my worries disappeared. He would always act with adults, and it felt strange to meet peers like this.This feeling was amazing and it was different from adults which required him to raise his heads.All the children in this room are going to walk on the same path as acting.It felt different from his school friends.\u201cHi. I\u2019m Choi So-Young.\u201d\u201cHello!\u201dWhen Choi So-young, the oldest and leader of the children on the first practice day, introduced herself first, the other children soon introduced themselves one by one.When the children started to chatter about everything without any problems, Director Park Ji-soo winked at the Assistant director.\u201cThen, guardians, come over here for a moment.\u201dDirector Park Ji-soo left the children to the Assistant director and headed to a different room together with the guardians.Even then, the guardians only followed Director Park Ji-soo with a puzzled look.Bam.The door closed.The door closed smoothly, but the guardians thought it was louder.Everyone was in a situation they had never even thought in their dreams. This was unexpected.Director Park Ji-soo opened her mouth.\u201cPlease keep it a secret about actor Lee Seoju. Please tell it to your kids as well.\u201d\u201cWhy? If Lee Seojun act here, it will become a hot topic.\u201dWhen asked by an instructor at an acting academy, director Park Ji-soo slowly explained why Seojun used his stage name. The other guardians nodded and listened to the story.\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201dStill, they wanted to spread rumors around their neighborhood that his son, daughter, and academy student were acting with together Lee Seojun. They wanted to brag.People will come flocking, reporters will take pictures. It was an opportunity to have their children become a star, but not to the extent of Lee Seojun.Director Park Ji-soo opened her mouth as if she already knew the thoughts of the guardians.\u201cIf the secret becomes known during the practice period, actor Lee Seojun will have quit. And if the practice is over and it becomes known during the performance, then the real performances will be replaced by another voice actors.\u201dThe practice room became quiet at the words of Director Park Ji-soo.Director Park Ji-soo was looking at the guardians, made eye contact with someone and quietly went outside.When the Director disappeared, everyone spoke their thoughts.Everyone was full of complaints about why they do not want it promote under the name of Lee Seojun.Then, a woman opened her mouth.\u201cIt might be better to have it known after the play.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIf it is known during the practice period and he quit, this play won\u2019t even go into Lee Seojun\u2019s filmography.\u201d\u201cWhat about telling them during the play?\u201d\u201cIf it is known during the performance period, they will come flocking to the children first. They will ask, \u2018Are you close to actor Lee Seojun, how was it during practice, and how was it during the performance?\u2019 But soon, everyone will dig into why Lee Seojun was excluded to the next performances.\u201dEveryone agreed at the woman\u2019s reasonings.\u201cThen rumors will start circulating. It happened because someone didn\u2019t follow the rules. Then public criticism will pour toward the children, parents, and even the academies. The public will say, \u2018I heard they broke the contract to make their names known.'\u201d\u201c\u2026 The effect will it be that much?\u201d\u201d\u201cReporters do it. Since they can\u2019t touch Lee Seojun, who hid himself for the children, we can find a way to raise the number of views with provocative content that can be a hot topic without putting in Lee Seojun\u2019s name. We don\u2019t want something like \u2018Actor Lee Seojun couldn\u2019t play because of someone\u2019s selfishness?\u2019 That can\u2019t be the hot topic.\u201dSomeone gulped down.\u201cThe names of the children will be on the play pamphlet, and they will quickly find out about the elementary schools. The same goes for the acting academies. I\u2019m sure everyone will guess what will happen after that. That\u2019s the worst case.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cThen, what\u2019s the best case?\u201d\u201cEveryone, Seojun acting here will strictly be kept in confidential and the play will end safely. As the Director said, we can let them knowbit when the play is over, so we can brag it from then on. Since they can\u2019t watch the play anymore, interviews will pour out to the children who were on stage with Seojun. If the child remains impressive then appearing in dramas or movies won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dThe guardians\u2019 eyes sparkled. The same was true from the academy instructors.An acting academy with a \u201cchild actor\u201d who acted with \u201cLee Seojun.\u201dIt\u2019s a strange phrase, but anything with the name \u201cLee Seojun\u201d is a good promotion.Elephant milk powder is still sold at a great price. The Monster Doll company that Lee Seojun played with is still successful. His daily videos on YouTube that are uploaded from time to time still received millions of views.Items with strange beliefs that aspiring actor students or family members must have, to allow them advance to Hollywood.The guardians here also had it.\u201cWell, the secret should be kept until the end of the play.\u201dAt the woman\u2019s words, everyone nodded, thinking about the future of their children and students.\u201cMission complete!\u201d\u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201d\u201cDAHO, good job!\u201dLooking at Seojun having fun and talking to the other children, An Daho put his cell phone back in his pocket.The practice on the second day was now over.The children and their guardians could not take their eyes off from either Seojun or An Daho while they were heading to the underground parking lot.When Seojun got on the car seat, An Daho checked the surroundings first and got on the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cHow was it playing with the other kids?\u201dAn Daho saw him enjoying with the other children, but it was still different from Seojun personally saying his thoughts.Seojun replied with a bright smile.\u201cI like them all! But if after the group practice, we won\u2019t have much time to meet each other again.\u201dAt Seojun\u2019s words, An Daho recalled the script of \u2018Spring\u2019.\u201cSeojun will to come out at the end. The character that you appear with is\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe main character! I am going to practice with So-Young only\u201d.\u201cOh, my.\u201dThe other guardians were quite disappointed to know that their child will not be practicing with Seojun. An Daho recalled this happening earlier.The staff of the second team secretly infiltrated among the other guardians and talked about the worst situation that will happen if their revealed that Seojun will act on the Play.Even if they couldn\u2019t get close to Lee Seojun, a relationship with Lee Seojun would still be a great title as Seojun becomes more famous.The next time they will meet Seojun as an actor, it will be easy to talk to him.\u201cI hope it ends quietly as the Team 2 planned.\u201dAn Daho, who started the engine, prayed in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHalf- Month of practice flew by.It was a short time for adults, but for children, it was not.The children were only awkward to Seojun at first, soon they forgot that he was a famous actor and they became close to each other enough to play pranks on him.Parents and academy instructors, who were disappointed that their children couldn\u2019t practice with Seojun, were satisfied at the sight of the kids playing with him.\u201cSeojun! Eat this ice cream! My mom bought it!\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll eat it.\u201dIn particular, buying snacks was the easiest way to bring the children scattered in different practice rooms together.Most of the snacks were simple such as ice cream, bread, and milk, but Seojun would sometimes bring pizza or hamburgers.\u201cSeojun, let\u2019s eat chicken next time!\u201dLee Da-jin, who plays the role of a hunter said while holding an ice cream cone in his hand.This was his fourth time to act in a play, but this was his first time to eat snacks every day of practice.\u201cShall we?\u201d\u201cI want pizza.\u201d\u201cNoona. We already ate it last time.\u201dThe guardians eagerly filmed the children enjoying themselves while eating.Their kids have a video with Lee Seojun! This could be used as brag to their families and friends for at least a whole year!When they made eye contact with Director Park Ji-soo, she pretended to zip her mouth with her hands.Director Park Ji-soo nodded awkwardly, hoping that the secret could still be kept even if they took a video.\u201cWe\u2019ll start group practice from today.\u201dFor the next two weeks, group practice was scheduled to begin on the stage where the play will be held.The children arrived on the stage where they auditioned.Unlike during the audition, empty boxes containing props that the stage production team was making, was scattered on the stage.\u201cLet\u2019s check the formation first\u201d.Director Park Ji-soo guided Choi So-young, the main character of \u201cSpring.\u201dThe background was already completed. The spotlight coming from the above showed the fantasy-like background. It was a cute background that matched the children\u2019s play.Finally, it was Seojun\u2019s turn. Seojun went up to the stage at the gesture of Director Park Ji-soo. A white cloth fell from the ceiling and spread out. The Blue Dragon was suspended in the air and it looks like it was flying.\u201cWow!\u201dAt the shouts of the children, Seojun also admired it. It was a Blue Dragon. A wonderful Blue dragon painted on a white cloth.\u201cThis is the Blue dragon. It is now Seojun\u2019s role. Seojun can speak through the microphone here.\u201dSeojun stood at the location pointed by Director Park Ji-soo.A thin board stood in front of Seojun, with a round hole in the middle. He could see the stage regardless of whether it was tailored to match Seojun\u2019s height or not.\u201cI made sure Seojun can see the stage here. Of course, the audience will not be able to see you. When you act with So-Young, you have to look at So-Young and get the timing right. Got it?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAfter the children learned their position, they started practicing on stage to familiarize themselves.While the children were practicing individually, Director Park Ji-soo checked the time and clapped to attract the children\u2019s attention.\u201cThen we\u2019ll start our last practice today! We will be using the same lighting, music, and sound effect as if it is the real performance. Even if you get the lines or timing wrong, you are going to continue until the end. Don\u2019t let your mistake overwhelm you just continue.\u201dThe children looked at the stage with nervous faces.This was unlike the sound effects and lighting in the practice room made by the teacher\u2019s voice. This was the real deal!\u201cSpotlight!\u201d*Bam*\u201cThe background has changed.\u201dThe children, who will appear in the first scene, stood first on the stage. The staff also moved the box away from the stage to give space for the first scene.The children in the second scene were standing close to each other so that they could easily climb up the stairs. Meanwhile, the other children were standing or sitting nearby waiting for their turn.Seojun, who will only appear at the end, sat a little away from the chair to not interfere with the children\u2019s movement. Seojun\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t look away from the stage, not even a second.Cameras were installed on several audience seats to monitor the children from the audience\u2019s view.\u201cLet\u2019s start!\u201d Director Park Ji-soo shouted when the staff sent a signal that It was all ready.The music started playing.Unlike in the practice room, where the children fumbled to find their position, the story progressed step by step while acting timidly.Choi So-young led the children like a veteran.Director Park Ji-soo was sitting on the front row while taking notes where the children did wrong. She considered the location of the background, the location of the props, and the lighting every time a child did something wrong.The last scene, it was now Seojun\u2019s turn.The children, who had already finished their turns, were comfortably sitting among the audience, while their guardians were busy taking pictures of their children with their phones.The staff also sneakily sat down among the audience in order to watch Seojun\u2019s acting.At director Park Ji-soo\u2019s gesture, the blue dragon white fluttered from the ceiling, and Seojun put the microphone close to his mouth.[Hatchling Blue Dragon\u2019s aura- Low level]Seojun\u2019s black eyes turned blue. The tip of his black hair also turned blue. His whole body\u2019s senses, especially the hearing, were enhanced to the point he could even hear Daho\u2019s breath sitting among the audience.A bit more. A little more.Two hard horns grew in Seojun\u2019s black hair. On the chubby cheeks that were pinkish, soft blue scales appeared.Seojun looked at the blue scales on the back of his hand.[Hatchling Blue Dragon\u2019s aura- Low level]This is the Aura of a young Blue Dragon.Aura alone shows the difference in \u2018class\u2019 among the other monsters.Depending on the intensity of the Aura, a part of his body will become blue.\u2018That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t use this in the practice room.\u2019At the audition, everyone was far away, and can\u2019t see the color of his hair closely, let alone the color of his eyes.However, in the practice room, So-young Noona act close to him. He didn\u2019t use his ability because she will see it.In other words, the intensity of his aura was weak during the practice, and he did not use more than that.People were satisfied with how he is acting, but Seojun wasn\u2019t satisfied with it.He could have done better. Now that Seojun was covered by the board, this was an opportunity to show off his skills to his heart\u2019s content.Inhale, exhale.And\u2026A blue dragon appeared in the theater.After the stage, everyone looked at the blue dragon installed above the stage, regardless of the children sitting in the audience, the guardians or the staff.The wind was not blowing, so it should\u2019ve been just a plain ordinary painted white cloth.\u201c\u2026 What device did you use for that?\u201dWhen asked by a guardian, the staff shook their heads.It was just a painting of a blue dragon.\u201cWow. I thought it was a real Blue Dragon.\u201d\u201cI know! It really felt like I was making a wish to the Blue Dragon.\u201dAs the children chatted, the adults finally came to their senses.Director Park Ji-soo and the president, who came to watch their first group practice on stage, look alternately between the blue dragon painting and Seojun, who was drinking water while sitting in the auditorium.\u201cThis is such a waste\u2026\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d\u201cWhat a waste!\u201d\u201cI agree a hundred times. No! A thousand times.\u201dA person approached the two people talking to each other how it was such a waste.\u201cSuch a waste\u2026\u201d\u201cExcuse me, boss.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026Oh, yes. What\u2019s going on?\u201dHe was a stage director.He unfolded the note he had taken while watching their performances.\u201cI thought about it while watching the practice earlier, but I hope we could put more props here. Like a real world. Trees, flowers, houses\u2026 In particular, the blue dragon should be three-dimensional or add something to the cloth to give more volume\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe stage director continued for a while. The president and Director Park Ji-soo nodded one after another while listening to the list. In the meantime, the Assistant director checked the time and sent the children and guardians home.The President counted the remaining dates. Two weeks. There are two weeks left before the performance.\u201cWould the props be made in time?\u201d\u201cWe have time but\u2026\u2026 Budget\u2026.\u201dThe stage director held the back of his neck. The background and props he wanted to make now was different from the props he tried to make it cuter. How much will it cost if he tried it to be realistic?The stage director\u2019s eyes wondered while waiting for the President response.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the budget.\u201dWhen he saw Seojun\u2019s performance and heard the suggestion of the stage director, his head couldn\u2019t stop wondering how the scene would become.Then he thought of a great idea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Musicals and plays are also made into DVDs and sold. It\u2019s a waste for us to not let others know about your acting in a play, so I\u2019d like to make it into a DVD. VOD too if possible.\u201dThe President was ecstatic on his idea on making this Play as a DVD because of Seojun. It was the same script, the same stage, and the same props, but his aura and synergy was different each time. There was definitely a difference when he was just practicing.Seojun thought it would be nice to film this and make it available in DVD. Also, it was very good to capture someone burst into genuine laughter. It would really feels like the stage is alive.The closer the performance date approached, the more he visualize the stage where he act together with his peers in front of the audience.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m recording such a performance!\u2019 Seojun nodded one after another at his suggestions.\u201cI like it, but what about others?\u201dThe President smiled brightly at Seojun\u2019s question. As soon as the DVD recording was brought up, the actors and their guardians all agreed without any opposition.\u201cEveryone agreed.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m fine, too.\u201dWhen Seojun said yes, An Daho also nodded. Whatever Seojun wants to do, it was clear that Cocoa Entertainment would support it, but the discussions on the terms and distribution of profits was still needed.\u201cThen I\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d\u201cWhat picture and stage name would you like to use for the pamphlet?\u201dThe performance is just around the corner. Now, they had to create promotional materials and pamphlets to distribute to the audience.\u201cI\u2019m going to use the blue dragon picture that I used in the last practice stage. For the stage name\u2026uhmm\u201dSeojun was a little shy regarding his stage name. His Mom, dad, uncle Hee-sing, and uncle Chan gathered to talk about what would his stage name be.Among the many suggested names, Seojun chose a fitting name for his role.\u201cNajin.\u201d (TL: A north Korean war ship. Very strong and sturdy.)The President blinked. He recalled something with the same name.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you get it?\u201dSeojun laughed so hard.* * *From the day the topic of the DVD is brought out, the stage began to become colorful.It was as if they were showing the power of their budget, the children\u2019s practice has become more perfect with background and the moving props.Choi So-young look at the stage with an excited face.She already acted in six plays at the age of 8th grade. Among them, there was also a musical for children.However, she have never seen a stage designed so beautifully. The same was true for Lee Da-jin, her classmate in the acting academy.\u201cI think I\u2019ll be able to act my best with this kind of stage.\u201d\u201cI know. But we can\u2019t act like him?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about Seojun?\u201d\u201cReally, he is incredible. I don\u2019t know how he can really do that with just his voice.\u201dChoi So-young recalled the time during their practice. The two-week practice for individual scene was great, but the group practice was the most crucial one.\u201cDo I have to be that good, as an actor, to enter Hollywood?\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201d\u201cSigh. Than, I would never be able to achieve it.\u201dLee Da-jin laughed at the appearance of Choi So-young.\u201cHe is really amazing. He really looked like a dragon that makes wishes come true.\u201d\u201cDa-jin\u2026do you really want to make a wish?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLee Da-jin nodded without any delay at Choi So-young\u2019s words. His answer made the two children giggle.* * *Lee Da-jin, who was eating snacks, raised his hand.Choi So-young become more skilled at acting whenever the blue dragon appeared.Like she was really desperate to make a wish. And as if answering, the Blue Dragon also exuded a tremendous atmosphere.When he saw the scene, he really felt like a blue dragon would grant his wish.When he went to a temple or church, Lee Da-jin would pray that he could really make a wish to the Blue Dragon.\u201cI want to make a wish, too!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dDirector Park Ji-soo asked back at the words of Lee Da-jin.Lee Da-jin, who spoke his mind without realizing it, quickly put his hands on his mouth.\u201cSeojun\u2019s acting was so real. I wonder how it would feel to act with him! Also, So-Young\u2019s skills have improved a lot, too!\u201dAt that, the other children raised their hands and their guardians applauded at Lee Da-jin\u2019s words silently.Director Park Ji-soo saw Seojun eating pizza. Seojun, who was eating the pizza deliciously, also raised his head to see what was happening.\u2018If Seojun\u2019s acting skills increase So-young\u2019s acting skills, what if he acts with other children?\u2019Director Park Ji-soo suddenly put down the pizza and asked Seojun, who was looking at him.\u201cWhat do you think, Seojun?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dSeojun replied like that and looked back at the script. Well, there are 14 people except for So-Young. But it\u2019s too much to do it for 14 times.Seojun skillfully checked the lines and asked again.\u201cCan we do it four people at a time?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dEveryone nodded. After the break, the stage was set up again. The blue dragon appeared on the stage.The Blue Dragon wasn\u2019t just a piece of cloth anymore. This prop was completed first by the stage director, but is still being revised. The current blue dragon model seems to have been removed from an amusement park parade.It\u2019s long tail could reach the end of the stage, and his large, sharp eyes looked down at the stage and the audience.It\u2019s long body was swaying like a wave.The stage got darker, and Seojun, who stood behind the thin board, grabbed the microphone. Then, he pressed the switch made by the stage director with all his heart and soul.*Blinking*Blue Dragon\u2019s eyes closed and opened.***\u201cAfter that day, I think the children\u2019s skills have improved a lot.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s limited to this play only.\u201d\u201cThis kind of experience is the best.\u201dGuardians and academy instructor chatted to each other quietly. As the academy instructor said, children became more skilled in acting after the practice with Seojun.\u201cWhen I asked him how he could do that, he said that there seems to be a real blue dragon above him, so he seems to think that there is really a blue dragon on the stage.\u201d\u201cMy kid was just staring at the prop box last time.\u201d\u201cProp box?\u201d\u201cYes. Those were the pieces of magic pearl collected by the protagonist.\u201d\u201cOh, I think I know.\u201d\u201cYes. He was like \u2018If I really take this and make a wish, it will come true. Should I make a wish?\u2019 He was still thinking bout it even at home.\u201d\u201cChildren tend to not be able to distinguish between reality and imagination.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201dBy discussing how to keep confidentiality about Seojun and buying snacks in order, guardians also became close to each other.\u201cI also want to make a wish whenever So-young makes a wish while watching their group practice.\u201d\u201cThe blue dragon is really amazing.\u201dThe chatter of the guardians reached the president\u2019s ear through the employee. Once again, the president\u2019s eyes went wide.***\u201cHey, are you really going to watch it?\u201d\u201cThis was the cheapest. Let\u2019s go to the PC room with the rest of the money.\u201d\u201cReally, I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201dAt Kim Soo-han\u2019s words, his friend face palmed himself. There was homework for summer vacation to watch plays or musicals. The school provided money, so any work at an affordable price could be watched free of charge.\u201cWe\u2019re high school students now. Isn\u2019t a children\u2019s play too much?\u201d\u201cEverything else was sold out. Let\u2019s watch this quickly and have fun later.\u201dThat\u2019s true, but his friend sighed again.\u201cYou know we have to write a review of this, right?\u201d\u201cI know. Well, I could just write \u2018I found my childhood innocence.\u2019 Furthermore, this is not a very well-known play, so the teacher won\u2019t even ask for the price of the ticket.\u201d\u201cOkay, I got it.\u201dThey had already come all the way to the Milky Way theater to watch the play. Kim Soo-han and his friend entered the Milky Way Center.\u201cIs this really a children\u2019s play?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201dThere were many adults. There were even some people who seemed to have come as a group. The audience was currently Half children, half adults.\u201cIt\u2019s a play with only children, so their family and friends must have come to watch it.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cWell, this is better than just the two of us.\u201dThere was an exceptionally noticeable group among the audience.There were no children and only adults.Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon was looking at the pamphlet. They were here together with Kim Hee-sung, Seo Eun-chan, Seojun\u2019s grandmother and grandfathers. All of them came together to watch their Seojun\u2019s first play.\u201cI guess this is Seojun.\u201dUnder the well-drawn dragon picture, theree was written \u201cNajin/8 years old.\u201dWhile everyone was focusing on the pamphlet, Seo Eun-chan looked around.\u201cBut there are more people than I thought\u201d.\u201cI think they are all from the acting academies.\u201dAn Daho popped up from somewhere and surprised his boss.Seo Eun-chan grabbed his heart.\u201cI thought I received an heart attack!\u201dShe ignored her younger brother\u2019s acting and asked An Daho.\u201cActing academy?\u201d\u201cI think some instructors told some people that Seojun will appear.\u201dAn Daho\u2019s eyes turned towards the academy principals and those who looked like instructors.They seemed to know that Seojun would be acting here.It was clear that the guardians all choose to be under the umbrella Lee Seojun\u2019s name value after the Children\u2019s play showing than being a prey for the reporters.Fortunately, there were still no articles or rumors about Seojun acting here. Even the children who came with us don\u2019t seem to know.\u201dThe children they brought to watch Seojun\u2019s performance were bored. Some only looked at their cell phones.Seo Eun-chan, who barely calmed down his beating heart, asked.\u201cThat\u2019s okay, right?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cDAHO, what about Seojun?\u201dWhen asked by Lee Min-joon, An Daho pointed towards the entrance of the backstage.\u201cHe have to focus from now on, so he asked me to get out of his way.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI heard it\u2019s going to be released as a DVD later on. When will it be released?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, we decided to sell the recorded version of the best performance out of the eight performances. So we\u2019ll probably sell it at the end of the play.\u201d\u201cThere are still two months left.\u201dLee Min-joon and Seo Eun-hye counted their fingers and enlisted people who would they present the DVDs.They had to send it to the Brown Black and to the acquaintances in the United States.[The play \u201cSpring\u201d is about to begin. I hope all the audience will begin to enter.]The staff pressed a button that lift up the curtains.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay(TL note: The theater has those large Screen usually used on kpop concerts so that they could see their idols face even from afar.)The spacious Audience seats weren\u2019t even half full. And the majority of the audience are either their family or friends.The only audience who had nothing to do with the actors were the two male students who came to watch the play as homework.Unlike the actors\u2019 parents, looking at the empty auditorium with disappointed eyes, the children looked nervous ever since they came to know that people were coming inside the empty auditorium during practice.To ease the tension they were feeling, the children were chatting and laughing at each other. After a while, Director Park Ji-soo caught the children\u2019s attention with a clap as per usual.\u201cAre you ready?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe children, who were wearing modern hanbok, answered.\u201cYes!\u201dThere was also a change in the children\u2019s clothes due to the generous amount of budget. When they first organized this play, they just wanted it to end moderately, but from some point, they wanted to make an impact with a \u201creal\u201d story.\u201cThen shall we say our cheer?\u201dAt the words of Director Park, the main character Choi So-young put her hands down. On top of it, Seojun and the other children put their hands as they gathered around in a circle.The staff took turns taking a video of Seojun and the other children, shoulder to shoulder while smiling at each other.This could be used as a material for the DVD.\u201cSpring!\u201d\u201cSpring!\u201d\u201cFighting!\u201dThe stage will begin soon.Seojun looked around the audience with a turned-off microphone. Every child on the stage looked excited with tension and expectation. But no one looked worried.Seojun smiled at their appearance. Seojun and the children knew that the stage they made is great.\u201cLet\u2019s get started!\u201dThe beep- sound rang and the theater became dark.Clap clap-Everyone was amazed at the stage. They thought it would be a simple background like those from fairy tales because it was a children\u2019s play, but it was a real background that expressed the shaking of the houses and trees that would usually appear in fantasy movies.The hometown of the main character, Spring, has been hit by drought for the past several years. Eventually, when his younger brother collapsed, she traveled in search of the Blue Dragon. She was hoping that the legend told by their ancestors was real.Spring traveled from place to place and helped people, but in return, she would only receive some unknown glass ball. It was useless, but she thought she should give it to her younger brother as a gift once he is cured, so she kept it on herself.(TL: The play\u2019s reference is Dragon Ball.)The audience rubbed their eyes without realizing it. Are they really kids?The stage equipment and props didn\u2019t stand out but everything seemed very real.In particular, the children\u2019s natural acting, no, they seemed to be watching the daily lives of people living in a foreign country on the television.There were some children among the audience who were new to plays. Their guardians thought, \u2018If I let my kids act on stage, would they be able to improve their acting skills?\u2019However, they realized that this play was a special case because on the other project where the children acted were very amateurish.Finally, Spring arrived in front of the cave of Blue Dragon.\u201cBlue Dragon, Blue Dragon! Please grant my wish.\u201dSpring prayed earnestly with her hands together.\u201cPlease save my brother. Please save my village.\u201dThe desperate appearance surprised the children who were attending the same acting academy as Choi So-young. She was good, but she wasn\u2019t that good.Spring reminded the audience of the people she met while traveling and her family\u2019s suffering from drought.Spring helped with the urgent task that needed to be solved right away, but she couldn\u2019t do anything about inhuman happenings.This is when the thought of the Blue Dragon legend of granting a wish came.\u201cBlue Dragon, Blue Dragon! Everyone is having a hard time.\u201dAt that time, a loud noise rang in the whole theater. The stage director trembled at the sound from the newly installed speaker.\u2018As expected, expensive things are really worth it!\u2019The clear sky, which was full of clouds and sun at the side earlier, disappeared.The stage got darker and darker. Then, lightning struck.Seojun\u2019s eyes, standing behind the props in the center of the stage, sparkled blue like the ocean.Now that no one was looking at Seojun, he was able to use his ability freely.[Hatchling Blue Dragon\u2019s aura Low Level]Together with Seojun\u2019s eyes, the color of his hair also changed. Small horns also grew, and dragon scales sprouted on his cheeks and hands.Although the lighting was strong, Seojun, in a dragonized form, could see the facial expressions and faces of each person sitting among the audience.Just like any play, there were people crossing their arms watching the play seriously. There were also others talking to the person next to them. There were children who enjoyed watching, but there were also those who were still on their phones.This is why he liked plays. Being able to see people\u2019s reactions in person is the best feeling.He was looking forward to seeing these people surprised later on.Seojun smiled.Here is the Blue Dragon that no one would be able to ignore.Seojun opened his mouth.Through the voice transformation machine prepared by the stage director, it was filtered once.[You are too noisy.]It was only one sentence.An unknown voice. A voice where others would not be able to distinguish between an adult or a child.The audience naturally opened their mouths to such an overwhelming aura.Because Spring was near where the aura originated, she felt as if she were standing in front of a tremendous being.Now, the Children\u2019s play looked like it wasn\u2019t really a Children\u2019s play.The cave reflected on the screen grew bigger and bigger. And a large blue dragon appeared in the cave.After exiting the cave, the blue dragon flew in the wide sky.Spring and the audience looked up and saw the blue dragon coming down from the ceiling.And the Blue dragon came down to Spring.Spring went closer.Very close enough to meet his big eyes.\u201cOh? Oh!\u201dAs the adults saw the Blue Dragon getting closer and closer on the screen, they stepped back without realizing it.However, they were blocked by the back of the chair and could not move anymore. Everyone crouched down and buried themselves in their knees.The blue dragon\u2019s head took the whole screen and was now right above the stage.\u201cOhh!\u201dThe audience breathed in and buried themselves deeply in the chairs.Unlike overwhelmed adults, the children were shocked and just looked at the Blue dragon.Blue Dragon\u2019s long beard waved like an ocean wave, reaching up to the floor, and his sharp eyes looked down at Spring and the audience alternately.Like a real blue dragon, everyone in front of Seojun felt small. His reinforced vision could see all the audience.Adults have stepped back in a strange sense of awe, and children\u2019s eyes were twinkling as tears couldn\u2019t get down due to extreme fear.Seojun opened his mouth, recalling the Blue Drago Hatchling\u2019s grandfather who was defending a human kingdom.[You are too noisy, kid]At the voice, the audience unknowingly gathered held their hands. It was not even cold, but they got goosebumps.This was something outside of Korea that have had never seen in their life.But that didn\u2019t mean it was scary. It was huge and supernatural that could only be unimaginable.Kim Hee-sung suddenly realized that he had felt this similar feeling.The devil.Of course, it\u2019s a little different. If his acting on the Devil was full of playfulness, it felt more humane. However, this feeling seemed to be like facing something other than human beings.\u201cBlue Dragon! Please help me.\u201dNot everyone in the audience could even open their mouths, but Spring, which got used to it when practicing, opened her trembling mouth to mutter her line.She let Blue Dragon know what she had experienced while traveling so far.After finishing her narration, the Blue Dragon felt kind of sorry.[Hmm. I\u2019m sorry]\u201cWhat?\u201d[Someone stole my magic pearl. I need that to make rain\u2026\u2026.]Spring jumped up at the words of the Blue Dragon.\u201cI\u2019ll be back! All you need is your magic pearls, right?\u201d[Yes, but I don\u2019t know where are they. I think the magic pearls are broken.]\u201cIt\u2019s okay! I\u2019ll be back soon! Please tell me how it looks like!\u201dThe blue dragon slowly opened its mouth.[It\u2019s blue and pretty. These patterns are engraved.]A polka dot pattern appeared in front of spring. Spring was amazed by the power of the Blue Dragon. Her eyes sparkled with admiration. Suddenly, Spring thought that the pattern was familiar.\u201cMy bag!\u201d[Huh?]Boom!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Three glass ball came out.She took the glass ball and lifted them up so that the blue dragon could see them well.\u201cBlue Dragon! Is this your magic pearl?\u201dBlue Dragon\u2019s eyes, which were half-closed, were now fully opened. He smiled.[Yes, it\u2019s my magic pearl. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll make your wish will come true in return!]\u201cGood for you, Blue Dragon! My wish is to rain on my hometown!\u201d[Do you have any other than that?]\u201cYes!\u201d[Okay. Wait a minute.]When the blue dragon winked, the pieces of glass in the hands of Spring came up into the air and turned shiny and round. The magic pearl fit perfectly at the feet of the blue dragon.[Well!]The Blue Dragon\u2019s head slowly disappeared into the screen, and the adults among the audience sighed out of relief. They saw the blue dragon moving around on the screen.Seojun recalled the laughter of the only family member of Blue Dragon Hatchling and the owner of the ability.A pleasant, reliable, dependable laughter that makes them forget all their worries.Thanks to the book of life, he laughed with the laughter of his grandfather back when he was just a Hatchling Dragon.[Hahahaha]As the blue dragon laughed, it began to rain. The sound of his laughter was refreshing as if they were swept away by the rain.Rain-like things began to fall on the stage too. Of course, it was a stage effect that could be done because of the big amount of budget.After a few days, Spring arrived in his village.Perhaps the rain falling due to the Blue Dragon has a mysterious power. The fields and rice paddies have already grown to the point of being ready to be harvested. Everyone was harvesting with a happy face.\u201cHey!\u201dAutumn, the younger brother of Spring, was now cured. He could now welcome Spring back with his open arms.The play ended with the hug of the two siblings. The heavy black curtains came down covering the stage.Clap!Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap!The sound of applause rang throughout the theater.* * *After the first stage presentation, there was a small party. There are still many performances left, but everyone happily celebrates and ate the foods prepared by their parents. Director Park sat around with the children.\u201cChange some lines?\u201dSeojun was sitting next to Director Park Ji-soo, at her question he nodded. Seojun had pizza and a glass of milk in both of his hands.\u201cYes. As I watch the audience, it felt like their attention was somewhere else in some scenes. So I wanted to change some lines.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. There are some plays where we also changed some parts before.\u201dSeojun continued to speak after Director Park Ji-soo\u2019s words.\u201cBut at the end, I could see that they become completely immersed.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dAt first, the children were quite interested with the play but as it goes on, their interest diminished. Their attention wasn\u2019t on the play anymore till the Blue Dragon appeared.The children\u2019s attention weren\u2019t only on the Blue Dragon, but also on the Magic Pearls. The president of the Milky Way prepared magic pearls as a souvenir and it was sold at a price higher than the ticket\u2019s.On their way out, adults and children bought the blue magic pearl one by one.Everyone knew that it was a made-up story, but they have this intuition that these Magic Pearls would give them luck.\u201cAnyway, this is all thanks to Seojun.\u201d\u201cDirector, what if there was a real blue dragons in front of them?\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cHmm. Like a blue dragon crying after losing its magic pearl?\u201dChoi So-young came closer at Seojun\u2019s words, sat down and said.\u201cWouldn\u2019t the scene be boring?\u201d\u201cBut noona\u2026 Even the laughing blue dragon attracted the audience attention\u2026\u201dThe laughing was really part of the script.Hatchling\u2019s grandfather laughed like that, but when he think about it, his grandfather wouldn\u2019t got to any human place and laughed like that.His Grandfather Dragon always pretended to be stern and always wore a serious face, but he smiled when he is in front of his grandson.\u201cWhat do you mean change some lines?\u201dLee Da-jin and the children approached them and also joined the conversation between Seojun and Director Park Ji-soo. Everyone added their opinions one by one.The children\u2019s opinions gathered and eventually decided to add and change some of the Blue Dragon\u2019s lines.The next performance will be in three days, so they decided to practice it in the meantime.\u201cAre you okay, director Park? The kids changed their lines.\u201dDirector Park laughed at the words of the assistant director.\u201cWe will see how it will be after that, let them do their things now. There must be a world on the stage that we don\u2019t know. It would be different if we planned it with the hope for success, but this project was designed for children, so if they want to change some parts they could do it.\u201dThey were watching Seojun as he talk to the other actors to plan the changes for the lines.\u201cBut I still have to guide them.\u201dCoach Park Ji-soo caught children\u2019s attention with clap as always.\u201cGuys.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t change your lines carelessly in other plays. It\u2019s possible because this play is yours.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dYours. Ours.The word stuck in the hearts of Seojun and the children.The children and Seojun know. The fact that such a free and fun theater stage is just a one life time opportunity.So they wanted to work harder and make this successful.On the second day of their performance.A group of students flocked to the Milky Way Center. They were brought by Kim Soo-Han and his friend, who came to watch the first performance.\u201cThat was amazing!\u201d\u201cI thought I was going to faint!\u201dThe other three friends shook their heads as they saw the two people expressing their feelings with all kinds of gestures.\u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing to watch in a children\u2019s play!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll pay for an internet cafe.\u201d\u201cWhat about a cup of ramen?\u201d\u201cCall!\u201dThe students were coming in with joy but stopped at the thought of food One student said.\u201c\u2026Can we even watch it quietly?\u201dThe lobby of the Milky Way was full of children and parents.\u201cI want to be Blue Dragon too! I bought magic pearl too!\u201d\u201cBlue Dragon! Blue Dragon! I have to make a wish!\u201d\u201cMA.GIC. PEARL! Buy me a magic pearl!The atmosphere among the children in the lobby is divided into three.Children who showed off to their first timer friends their Magic Peals. They came to the Milky Way for a second time in hope to meet the Blue Dragon and beg his parents to make a Wish.There were also those who cry and whine. They were children who came because of their friends boasted it in their kindergarten or elementary school. Aside from the play, the children came to buy the Magic Pearls.The last group is the children brought by their parents at the recommendation of an acquaintance. They were children who were not interested in plays and did not care about Magic Pearls.Students ears were ringing due to the children\u2019s high pitched voices. They blocked their ears and headed towards the ticketing office. The employee looked tired as she gave the tickets, she must have suffered a lot.\u201cDo you have any tickets left?\u201d\u201cWhat would you like to watch?\u201d\u201cChildren\u2019s play, Spring.\u201dThe friends, who followed Kim Soo-Han to watch the play, pretended to be strangers because it was embarrassing to let others know they are going to watch such childish plays at their, but Kim Soo-Han talked to the staff without much thought.\u201cYes. There\u2019s still room.\u201d\u201cThen I will buy 5 tickets.\u201d\u201cYou must have watch the first show.\u201d\u201cYes. I even bought a magic pearl.\u201d\u201cWhat? Did you also buy a magic pearl? Are you a kid?\u201cHahaha. You\u2019ll buy it after you see it, too.\u201dThey look at their backs where the children were shouting, \u201cSpring! Blue Dragon!\u201d. then, they look at Kim Soo-Han, who also bought a Magic Pearl, made the three first timers speechless.\u201cWhat kind of play is this?\u201d* * *When everyone entered the theater, the audience seats were half full. The students, were expecting chaos, sighed. It seems that the children knows how to behave properly.They initially thought it was because of their parents, but there was no way that the excited children would listen.Most of the Childrens were holding the blue Magic pearl they bought before the performance.They were enjoying themselves as they play with their Pearls, but the children who were dragged in by their parents had empty hands.\u201cYou really don\u2019t need to buy it? All of your friends bought it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a marble. Buy me a car later!\u201dHowever, he was a child who didn\u2019t know he would regret only less than an hour later.Beep- the sound was heard, and soon it became dark in the theater.Even before the curtain rose, the sound of thunder and lightning rang in the whole theater.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThe audience who watched the performance on the first day turned their heads toward the direction where the sound came out. This was different.Seojun, was on one side of the stage. He smiled slightly and turned on the microphone.[Hatchling Blue Dragon\u2019s Aura Low-Level][Wuwuwu]They heard something sobbing.The children felt a sharp pang in their hearts, they also wanted to cry. While, the adults felt sympathy at the crying child.[My magic pearl\u2026!]After that, the audience was immersed in the play. They leaned over and didn\u2019t took their eyes off from the stage.When Spring was in danger, the Audience reacted as if she were really in danger, and when Spring cried, they cried together.Then, the blue dragon appeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They wanted to move away from the blue dragon as his face took the whole screen. His big and sharp eyes blinked.[So loud!] (TL: the previous line was \u2018You are too noisy\u2019. They change it in order to show the arrogance that a Dragon should have.)The voice of the child-like blue dragon rang.Somewhere in Seojun\u2019s body showed some blue dragon scales again, and his hearing, was enhanced for several times. Seojun\u2019s ears could even hear the audience breathing.\u2018Omo.\u2019\u2018Ottoke.\u2019\u2018Scary\u2019[You are too loud!]Seojun shouted as if he had become a real young Blue Dragon, or the same hatchling Blue Dragon, the owner of the ability.\u201cBlue Dragon! Help me!\u201d[I can\u2019t help you! I don\u2019t have my magic pearl!]\u201cThis! Is this your magic pearl!\u201d[My magic pearl! Thank you! I\u2019ll grant you a wish!]\u201cMy wish is\u2026\u201dSome children, who are still unable to distinguish between reality and story, jumped out of their chairs and shouted while holding the Magic Pearls above their heads as if they were Spring.\u201cPlease give me a lot of pocket money!\u201d\u201cPlease let me eat pizza tomorrow\u201d.\u201cI want to go to an amusement park!\u201dAt the sudden situation, the audience was in confusion. Choi So-young wondered if she should continue her lines. However, in that brief moment, Seojun, whose ears could clearly hear their words, smiled and said.[Good! Anyone else has a wish?]At the playful voice of Blue Dragon, the quick-witted music director lowered the volume of the background sound.Calm music was played in the theater, and the children, encouraged by the words of the Blue Dragon, made a wish with their magic pearl.The children, who did not buy a Magic Pearl, rolled their feet in envy as they saw their friends excitedly making their wishes, hoping that it will come true.\u201cPlease let my mom get better soon!\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t let me attend summer classes tomorrow!\u201dChildren\u2019s wishes came from all over the place. The voices of adults muttering them to stop from time to time, were also heard in Seojun\u2019s ears.The voices of the children, who were mumbling, calmed down and the eyes of the Blue Dragon turned towards Spring.[How about you?]\u201cI have a wish, too! Please let the rain fall on my hometown!\u201d[Good! I\u2019ll listen to your wishes!]Ahahaha! It began to rain with the laughter of the blue dragon.The curtain on the stage went down, director Park Ji-soo, staff, and children rushed towards Choi So-young and Seojun.\u201cBoth of you did a good job!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d say that! So-Young and Seojun, I thought the stage was going to be ruined!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all because Seojun\u2019s initiative.\u201dChoi So-young gave credit to Seojun for the compliments coming from the adults and their friends. Well, unlike her, whose mind went blank at the sudden situation, it was Seojun who continued the play with an ad-lib.\u201cYou did great this time too.\u201dAt that time, it was really great that she grasped his intentions. Seojun did not proceed with the story anymore, but she still answered his ad-lib appropriately.\u201cBoth of you did a good job!\u201d\u201dStarting with director Park Ji-soo\u2019s applause, everyone applauded the two actors behind the stage. Seojun felt warm in his hearts as he saw his colleagues praising him.Oh, this is so nice.Children finished removing their makeup and changed their clothes. They gathered in the practice room. After reviewing what happened on the stage, they decided to meet in order to plan for the next stage.\u201cShould we also add the Wishing part for the next performance?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nice!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk to the director and the music director!\u201d\u201cShould we change our lines a little bit?\u201dThus, the lines of Blue Dragon and the characters changed little by little at the opinions of the children.Sometimes a child-like blue dragon, sometimes a grandfather-like blue dragon, and sometimes a real god-like blue dragon. Various blue dragons variations were the suggestion by the children.Contrary to the friendly backstage, the Milky Way lobby was in a worst situation than before the performance.Before the performance, children who passed by the stands without much thought, began to beg their parents as soon as they saw a blue shining Magic Pearl.\u201cDad Magic Pearls! Buy me some!\u201d\u201cI want to make a wish, too!\u201dWhen his mom and dad gave up, they would bought him magic pearl.\u00a0 He could now go towards his friends excitedly and show them his magic Pearls. Among those children, there was the same child who asked for a car.\u201cBlue Dragon! Please grant my wish!\u201d\u201cListen.\u201d\u201cWe will comeback to see you again! I still have a wish to make!\u201dWith the support of the children, the magic pearls was constantly being sold.The three friends who criticized Kim Soo-Han and his friend on why they were buying some Marbles, went in line behind the small childrens to buy the magic Pearls.\u201cHey, really. I don\u2019t know what this feels like.\u201d\u201cRight. I know it\u2019s a fictional story, but it feels like the legend really exists.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if the blue dragon would grant my wish or not, but if there was a real dragon, it would feel like that.\u201dEveryone seemed to have the voice of the Blue Dragon still remaining in their heads. He became more nervous just by thinking about it.\u201cBy the way, did you see this?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dKim Soo-han was holding a pamphlet. From Choi So-young as the main character, Spring, to the actor\u2019s photo, name, and age of the\u00a0 extra character were also written he pointed to one of them. It was a photo of the painting of the Blue Dragon with a small description written below it.[Blue Dragon, Najin/8 years old]\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the voice of an 8-year-old?\u201dIn addition to the students, adults who read the pamphlet also looked alternately between the age and the picture.\u201cIs he a genius?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026there are many talented people these days.\u201d\u201cBut this was a little different from the first play.\u201d\u201cThe blue dragon looked like a grandfather on the first day, but this time it was like a child.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s that, too, but I also liked it because I was also immersed from the beginning.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun because it\u2019s a play, not a movie or drama that\u2019s definitely edited.\u201d\u201cWill the next Performance will also be different?\u201dAfter hearing the conversations of their friends who watched the first performance, the other three also decided to come again and watch the next performance. They were also thinking of inviting other class mates.Soon, some Jooyoung High School students looking for cheap and worthy plays for their vacation homework, gathered at the Milky Way Theater.* * *\u201cIt was so much fun!\u201dSeo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon smiled at Seojun\u2019s words.These days, Seojun would always be excited after coming back from the theater.He also marked all the date of his play on the large calendar.The same was true for the other children.\u201cMy dad likes the grandpa\u2019s blue dragon.\u201d\u201cMom like the child blue dragon.\u201d\u201cI like them all!\u201dThe performance \u201cSpring,\u201d which changes a little every time, had a large audience since then show. There were even some dates where the tickets were sold out.The show was really a successful one, he could tell because from time to time there were people who would come and ask for autographs.First of all, he used Najin\u2019s autograph, but he really wanted to do it under the name of Lee Seojun later.\u201cI heard the seats are sold out these days\u201d.\u201cYes! There\u2019s no empty seat!\u201dA review was posted on the Internet after the third play, in which the audience had a separate time to make wishes.[Title: Please watch the children\u2019s play \u201cSpring\u201d]Make sure to watch the children\u2019s play \u201cSpring\u201d at the Milky Way Theater!It\u2019s a really cool play.In particular, if my child does good things after watching the play, the magic pearls held by the Blue Dragon would be given.If you collect three of them, the Blue Dragon would definitely grant your wish, so my child work harder on this than collecting compliment stickers.Thanks to the play, he eat well, clean up his toys, and read books. These days, he is only looking for books with Blue Dragon, but there aren\u2019t many on libraries.Of course, if the wish is too hard to grant I would say, the Blue Dragon won\u2019t be able to fulfill it either. I often used the Blue Dragon just to let my child behave well. I\u2019m sorry, Blue Dragon.There were many children watching the play these days, perhaps thanks to the reviews posted on Mom Cafe, but somehow word of mouth also spread among students, and many teenagers and adults would also watch it these days.The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, were the most excited about the sold-out record every day. They would always distributed the data to reporters ever since.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Najin the voice actor!]-I feel like these days, they call every child actor the Second Lee Seojun Ke Ke Ke.-It\u2019s just a play between the kids. It\u2019s obvious that it\u2019ll be childish.-Kids are working hard, so you should compliment them. It\u2019s the reporter who gave the title like that.With the last performance just around the corner, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism hoped for extended performance, but the Spring team just shook their heads. This was because the children\u2019s school was about to start, and adults wanted to let the world know that Lee Seojun acted in the play.The last performance after the three-month-long play.\u2018Last.\u2019That one word came heavily to the actors of \u2018Spring\u2019. Seojun watches the faces of his friends sitting in a circle in the practice room.After this, they won\u2019t be able to get together and eat snacks, and they also won\u2019t be able to change the lines on their next stage either.Someone made a sniffling sound. The sound made all the others\u2019 eyes red, no matter who started. Seojun\u2019s eyes turned red, too. His vision was blurred by tears.They felt fun, excited, and happy in the past three months. It was so hard to let go of the time spent together. It\u2019s not that they won\u2019t meet in the future anymore, but they wondered if there would still be a day when they would be on stage with this same team. Knowing of this fact,\u00a0 Seojun was even sadder.\u201cDon\u2019t cry! The makeup will be removed!\u201dChoi So-young jumped up. After saying that, So-young also had a red tip on her nose.\u201cLet\u2019s cheer up! Since it\u2019s the last one! Let\u2019s act with our very best capability!\u201dEveryone nodded at Choi So-young\u2019s words. In the last three months, she would always be the one leading the whole team.Everyone put their hands down together. Each person looked at each other\u2019s faces and shed tears.\u201cSpring!\u201d\u201cSpring!\u201d\u201cFighting!\u201dThe children shouted loudly.Seojun grabbed the microphone.\u201cThis would be the last time I would be holding the Microphone.\u201dHe felt warmth from the hard microphone.His role requires only his voice, but when he was like this, he would really become a blue dragon and felt like he was acting on stage. Seojun looked around the whole place where he was standing.\u201cIt\u2019s really the last one.\u201dHis tears were about to burst.He can meet his friends again, but he doesn\u2019t know why it was hard to part like this. He didn\u2019t felt like this during the time he filmed movies.Beep!That was the sound that marked the start of the performance.It was really the last performance.\u201cSince it\u2019s the last one, I should work harder!\u201d[Hatchling Blue Dragon\u2019s aura Low Level]Seojun activated his ability. His eyes and the tip of his hair turned blue. Two horns gradually grew on his head, and dragon scales sprang upon his cheeks.Seojun closed his eyes tightly and began breathing.\u2018More.\u2019[E.L.F\u2019s basic breathing]\u2018More.\u2019At the end of the five fingers of both hands holding the microphone, his nails turned blue as they became dragon sharp claws.Realizing something from the ability, Seojun soon knows how to use it properly. Seojun opened his eyes and looked toward the side.The blue light hovering around Seojun\u2019s body headed toward the blue dragon model hiding behind the screen on the wall.The blue light wrapped around the blue dragon model. The Blue Light brought the model of the Blue Dragon to life.Its large eyes were gently closed and the beard, which had been moving regularly, gently shook. The stiff mane seemed to shake gently in the wind. The blue scales covered with artificial colors became vibrant sea lights.Now, Seojun became the real blue dragon.[Roar!]The low cry of the beastly blue dragon marked the beginning of the performance.The audience was curious about how it would be today, while the first-timers got goosebumps at the sound.Everyone was immersed in the play without saying a word.The sound of coughing, the sound of the chair shaking due to the movement of the body and the noise made by the children, were as if muted. Everyone looked at the stage with tension all over their bodies.The children on the stage acted harder than ever because it was their last performance.Their heart pounded with their heartbreaking performance.Soon the blue dragon appeared on the screen. Not only the audience who watched the play for the first time, but also the audience who watched the play several times, and the staff who installed the Blue Dragon, opened their mouths without realizing it at the sight of the seemingly alive Blue Dragon.The mechanically moving long beard, stiff hair, and the still movement of its eyelids all disappeared.The hard scales of the blue dragon sparkled. The blue-painted paint turned into the shade of the mysterious deep sea.As if breathing, they felt a weak coming out from the tip of the blue dragon\u2019s nose.The picturesque blue eyes of the dragon were mysteriously lively, and its two claws that were previously attached awkwardly were sharp as if it could pierce anything. The blue mane of the blue dragon shook due to the wind.This was the real thing.A living dragon was now in front of them.A large blue dragon reaching up to the ceiling of the theater, looked down at them.[You found my Magic Pearls, Thank you.]\u2018That mouth shouldn\u2019t have open\u2026\u2026?\u2019 These were the thoughts of the Stage Director.In line with the movement of the mouth, the beard and mane moved gently.The heavy voice penetrated the hearts of the audience.Seojun, who became a dragon, recalled the Hatchling\u2019s life that he discovered in the library of life.He remembered the grandfather who lived with the Hatchling. A big body and a kind face.Blue Dragon, the guardian deity of the human kingdom.Although he was friendly to the Hatchling, his grandfather did not forget to put distance from humans.While protecting them, he maintained his cold attitude toward humans. The Hatchling wanted to be a Dragon like him.In the first stage, Seojun copied the grandfather. However, as he went through many stages, his connection with Hatchling grew.He didn\u2019t copy any other personalities for the next performances.The Hatchling never grew up as the Dragon he wanted because he died early.[I\u2019ll grant your wish in return]At the words of the vividly alive Blue Dragon, children and some of the people in the audience naturally joined hands. In Seojun\u2019s eyes, he could see people with desperate expressions.Although it is false, Seojn thought that at this moment, he had become the guardian dragon that Hatchling wanted.The play is now over. Heavy curtains came down covering the whole stage.Although the theater was brightened, only heavy silence remained among the audience as the impact of the vividly alive Blue Dragon was enormous.Soon the curtain rose, and the children appeared on the stage to say their goodbyes.Clap clap clap!Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap!Wow!Those who jumped up from their seats applauded and shouted.\u201cCool!\u201d\u201cIt was the best!\u201d\u201cDa-jin!\u201dWhen someone called his name, Lee Da-jin, dressed as a hunter, came forward to greet him and waved his hands.The audience memorized all the actors\u2019 names from the pamphlet. Those who came to see the play several times, called out their names one by one, perhaps because they were acting unusual.Lee Da-jin smiled and just waved because he didn\u2019t know what to do.The children were shy but could still bow and smile towards the audience.And, there is one last person left. He has never appeared on the stage, but his voice alone captivated the hearts of every children and adults who watch the play.He is an actor who has made a sacred and heavier voice than ever before.The audience\u2019s eyes turned to one child. Among the children in hanbok, there was a child wearing a T-shirt and pants alone.Kim Soo-han, who came to watch the play with his friends again today, shouted.\u201cNajin!\u201dSeojun, wearing a hat, took a step forward at the call.Blue Dragon!Blue Dragon!Soon the children\u2019s voices could be heard. Seojun looked through the audience once again and bowed down to greet them. Then he raised his hands and waved them.\u201cShow your face on the next play!\u201dThe audience burst into laughter at those words.The actors also stood side by side smiling. They each held the hands of the person on their side.One, two.\u201cThank you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the future, there would be no more practice and no more performances.The children, hugged each other on the back stage and started crying.In the middle of the practice room, there were delicious foods such as pizza, chicken, and jokbal.Tension eased and they have now calmed down their emotions.The hungry children quickly began to fill their stomachs. Seojun, whose eyes are still red from crying, also took a piece of pizza and bit it.Munch munch.While chewing pizza, Seojun thought.Until now, he didn\u2019t study how to properly use the ability. He just used the right ability in a fitting way.But this time it was different. He acted like what the Hatchling wanted. In the play, many things resembled the life of the Hatchling.Perhaps that\u2019s why the Hatchling, who couldn\u2019t grow because of his short life, felt like he grew during his acting.Finally, Hatchling revealed his own dignity, not just copying his grandfather.\u201cDid Hatchling become the guardian dragon he dreamed of?\u201dThe Hatchling pattern drawn in his neck sparkled as if it was telling it was satisfied.If he looked down he wouldn\u2019t see the pattern, but the blue light emitted was so intense that his eyes hurts.He didn\u2019t mean to, but he felt like he has solved the wishes of one of his many previous lives regrets in a cool way.\u201cI should go to the library when I go back.\u201d\u2019Seojun munch the last slice of pizza in his mouth.\u201cBut the Blue Dragon, don\u2019t you think it just become alive?\u201d\u201cI know. I saw it on the backstage, and it must have been really a surprised.\u201dChoi So-young, who finished her portion of pizza early and took a chicken leg, nodded one after another while biting it.\u201cThe blue dragon felt like it was really breathing. It was minimal so I thought I saw something wrong, but it everyone felt that way, it must be real.\u201d\u201cThe stage director was also out of his mind and went to check. He screamed \u2018We didn\u2019t make the device like this.\u2019 And he ran away.\u201dWhen Lee Da-jin imitated the stage director, the children burst into laughter.Come to think of it, they didn\u2019t see their guardians of staff except An Daho. Perhaps everyone were still unable to leave the stage.\u201cDid the Dragon became real?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible. There are so many unbelievable things in the world.\u201dEveryone nodded at the words of a child interested in UFOs. Then he narrated about the amazing things he had gone through.The stage director, who was checking the Blue Dragon model, shook his head.\u2018It wasn\u2019t like this.\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe it, so he hesitated to touch the model of the blue dragon that came down to the stage.Director Park Ji-soo, who had been checking the recorded video, spoke.\u201cIt was doing the usual movements in the recording video.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So what we thought was really wrong?\u201dDirector Park Ji-soo shrugged at someone\u2019s words. People were speechless by his gesture.* * *After the Play was over, all the children went home.And the time has come for the guardians to wait patiently.The day of the last Performance, dinner.At the same time, many posts were posted on SNS.The fastest thing to get on the Internet were the acting school that had been waiting for so long for the press to click the post button.[A child actor who acted with Lee Seojun, Choi So-Young!]#Children\u2019s Play Spring#Main character#LeeSeoJun #ChoiSoYoung[Acted with Hollywood star, Lee Seojun!

He checked the articles and YouTube videos.\u201cHey, why are you so nervous?\u201d\u201cDid you cause any trouble?\u201dKim Soo-han looked down at his hands at the words of her friends.

Well\u2026 I am very dumb. I forgot that Na in Korea also refers to Me, I and I am so najin was like I am Jin. But because it was introduced as stage name I overlooked at that fact.)The voices of the whispering friends gradually lowered. Everyone saw Kim Soo-han wearing a strange expression.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cAm I crazy?\u00a0 Najin is Lee Seojun. He played the role of Blue Dragon. Najin is Lee Seojun!\u201dKim Soo-han, who got goosebumps all over his body, screamed. At the loud noise, people in the PC room looked toward Kim Soo-han and his friends.Regardless of the commotion, Kim Soo-han wasn\u2019t bothered by the gaze he was receiving. He was still processing his thoughts.He recalled Najin, who was wearing a hat on stage. \u2018He waved his hand at me\u2026What?

And again, the students drew attention. Among them, there was a reporter who came out to investigate the actual condition of the PC room.\u201c\u2026 But you got his autograph under Najin\u2019s name.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more rare!

What? What?\u201dFriends who were discussing whether Najin\u2019s signature was better or Lee Seojun\u2019s signature. They heard Kim Soo-han\u2019s trembling voice and asked.\u201cWhat?

How did you ask an 8-year-old boy to sign all the tickets you have collected so far?-Thanks to that, you get to have two autographs, one from Najin and one from Lee Seojun. So Jealous \u3160\u3160-He called 5 friends to watch the 2nd episode, and on the 3rd episode, his friends invited other friends, so a lot of students from the same school came to watch it.-I think I should go to Jooyoung High School to interview some witnesses.-Teachers are at a loss.

It was an article about the story of the children\u2019s play Spring and the reason for using a stage name.All the articles were posted on the Internet at the same time and fans, who were active, clicking on the article.-I was able to witness Seojun\u2019s acting (even though it\u2019s just his voice!)-If they had given a hint, I would have found out about it and watched it!-I understand the reason when I look at the notice.\u2026 But it\u2019s still a shame.Many comments were saying it was a shame, and the number of views on the notice rose rapidly.In addition, post from fans, who has their nephews or siblings as actors and got no choice but to watch them, felt lucky at the fortune of being a successful fan. They got to meet their idol and even watch him acting in person (Even if he only voice acted.)[Title: I gave a lot of toys to my nephew.I gave a gift to my nephew, who had been whining for almost a week because I felt indebted to him.I bought delicious chicken for my sister and brother-in-law, who said they had a lot of work to do.Yeah.The reason why I watch the play was because of my Nephew.Honestly, I didn\u2019t know it was Seojun just by hearing his voice. I found it out only after the article came out. Actually, all the children were very good at acting. When Blue Dragon comes out, I got overwhelmed from there. I just buried myself in the chair without realizing it.All the adults were like me, while the children didn\u2019t know what to do.

I don\u2019t think a quarter of us had watch it, it\u2019s a shame. \u3160\u3160The theater was small and only a few people could watch it. Seojun\u2019s fan cafe, where there are many people who haven\u2019t watched it, posted their thoughts expressing regret every few seconds.Kim Soo-Ryeon, head of the public relations team, was looking at the fan cafe. He turned his head and looked at Seo Eun-chan.Even after work, the public relations office was still full of staff from the 2nd team and public relations team. They could hear phone ringing everywhere.\u201cShould I upload it?\u201d\u201cYes, post it now.\u201dClick.The fan cafe exploded again with just a click of Kim Soo-Ryeon.\u201cIt\u2019s up!\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s already up?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s perfect right now.\u201dSeojun and his parents gathered in the living room and looked at the laptop. They saw the most noticeable post and beautifully decorated cafe with Seojun\u2019s photos.[(Announcement) Lee Seojun\u2019s fan meeting schedule]The notice contained the date and time of the fan meeting and the ticketing date. In addition, in an exceptionally large letter, there was a limitation written of \u201cfor regular members of the fan cafe only.\u201d\u201cDaho is very thoughtful. For the fans who haven\u2019t watch the play, a fan meeting would be held.\u201d\u201cDAHO, you\u2019re amazing!\u201dSeojun nodded at his father\u2019s words. When he was practicing hard for the play, he was confused to see Daho calling and working here and there, but it turned out it was because of the fan meeting!Thanks to the slow preparation from three months ago, preparations for the fan meeting are nearing to its end. It was a fan meeting for fans who were disappointed because they weren\u2019t able to watch the play.\u201cThere are so many comments.\u201dAt his mom\u2019s words, he looked at the comment box. Once refreshed, dozens of comments were created. He read the comments that caught his eyes.-I think I know why Seojun used his stage name.\u2026.-No matter how big the venue is, I don\u2019t think I could still go.-Half of the tickets are already sold\u2026(Picture of the venue with half of the seat are shaded grey.)\u201cWhat\u2019s this seat are grey?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already been selected, which means it\u2019s already booked.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dSeojun continues reading the comments and noticed some unusual comments.-?? Why there?-I heard they might come to Seojun\u2019s fan meeting.-No, there are many concerts and fan meetings always gathered there.-Only the members who signed up for the fan cafe can buy it, right?-Because of 48 hours, there are many fans who signed up for this cafe. \u3160\u3160-If you look at their subscription year, they were here even before than us.Seojun tilted his head and visited the fan cafe of Brown Black, where he joined for fun. Seojun\u2019s fan meeting was also the main focus there.At first, there were many posts such as \u201cI can\u2019t believe that the baby is already having a fan meeting\u201d and \u201cHe grew a lot \u3160\u3160,\u201d but soon, a new post was posted. This post was the beginning of the problem.-A lot of acquaintances will be coming to his fan meeting. Will they come too?-I know. They\u2019ll come, right?There\u2019s no way they won\u2019t come. Did they have a schedule on that day?-Interaction between Brown Black\u2026\u2026. Sounds fun.\u201cMom, you should call uncle.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dSeojun showed Brown Black\u2019s fan cafe post to his mom and dad. The couple\u2019s expressions turned serious as they were reading the titles of the posts.This was only a fan meeting for Seojun\u2019s fans. Not for fans who love Brown Black.\u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye picked up her cell phone.\u2018Yes, yes!

It\u2019s okay. There\u2019s already a solution.\u201dSeo Eun-chan hung up the phone and quickly urged team 1 to post Brown Black\u2019s schedule on their fan cafe.Employees who saw the number of views exceeding 2,000 in a blink of an eye sighed with relief.\u201cGood thing they have conflicting schedules.\u201dIt was not a vacation, but a week-long European schedule.It was a pity that Brown Black could not participate in Seojun\u2019s fan meeting, but they didn\u2019t want to fill Seojun\u2019s first fan meeting with their fans.They promised Seojun that they would appear in each other\u2019s fan meeting next time.\u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing this for the past 3 months. We have countermeasures ready.\u201d\u201cI should post it on Seojun\u2019s fan cafe too or release it to the media.\u201dUnlike other celebrities\u2019 fan meetings, which feature many other acquaintances, Seojun\u2019s fan meeting was not scheduled to feature another artist.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re just famous, but Seojun\u2019s acquaintances are just amazing people.\u2026.\u201dEmployees were eagerly examining the president\u2019s words and nodded.Brown Black, who is always listed as a top idol, and Hollywood actors, who starred in the drama, which recorded the highest ratings among the three major dramas, and reached its heyday.Seo Eun-Chan shook his head. Team leader Kim Soo-Ryeon, who posted on Seojun\u2019s fan cafe, laughed.Soon, there were many comments on the article. Many were saying it was a relief.\u201cIt\u2019d be crazy if just one of them appeared.\u201d\u201cBy the way, Seojun has a lot of fans.\u201dEveryone nodded as they watched the endless new comments. The comments posted here alone exceed the number of seats at the fan meeting. They expected it will become a bloody ticket when the real ticketing begins.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dIn the meantime, the articles posted on the two cafes were published.[Lee Seojun\u2019s fan meeting, Brown Black is filming overseas!][No one is coming!

No, the small door disappeared entirely.[Slime\u2019s digestion ability] and \u201cFairy\u2019s Glitter\u201d that Seojun first used were from this door. He expected their tattoos to disappear but for some reason, they became bigger.The only remaining door was this yellow door slightly taller than Seojun\u2019s current height. This was the recent door to open.\u201cIt was hard to get in because my body got bigger, but I shouldn\u2019t have got rid of the door of my past life.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve built a library of life.\u201dThe library of life was not built in a lifetime. One life made the foundation, another made the wall, another made the bookcase, and the other made the ceiling. In addition, it was a place where many other lives used their abilities to create it.A place where he thinks he know it well, but there would still be many amazing functions that he forgot.\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s take a look at the Hatchling book.\u201dWhen Seojun touched the yellow door, the door opened.White energy poured out. The bright atmosphere made him feel better. Seojun hummed and looked at the bookshelf.\u201cThis book is\u2026\u201dIt was a book of [Fairy\u2019s Glitter]. Next to the book is the ability of [Connection of Orchestra Conductors]. [Summer Bear\u2019s hibernation] was also\u00a0in\u00a0the bookshelf next to it.Seojun noticed the fact and looked around the library. The feeling of being wider than when he first opened the door was not just a feeling.\u201cIt got bigger.\u201dThe library of life, which recognized that Seojun could not pass through the small door anymore, but all the libraries together into one.\u201cOhh. This function came from when I was an Ogre. I see.\u201dSeojun nodded and praised his past life for incorporating the expanding functions. But\u2026\u201cWhy is this library still the same?\u201dSeojun, who left the library of life, crouched down in front of the door of his first life. Every time he put the book in another library, it would return back to the Black Door.He even emptied a whole shelf and left only the first book of his life but would always find its way on the Black Door.Seojun, who was still looking at the door of his first life, stood up and scratched his cheek.\u201cSigh, let it be. As long as it is not harming anything it is okay.\u201dSeojun walked. And stood in front of [Blue Dragon Hatchling]\u2019s book. He took out the book and read it again. Neither the front nor the back has changed. It remained the same until the death of the Blue Dragon, which was hunted by the Knights.However, there was a newly written sentence.[Blue Dragon\u2019s Hatchling, Seydonin, finished his job under the pseudonym \u201cBlue Dragon\u201d even in the new whole world. Seidonin fell asleep with a proud heart]That\u2019s what it said.And a notification window appeared in front of Seojun, who read the sentence.[Hatchling Blue Dragon\u2019s Aura Low Level Change!]Seojun took out his ability to put his neck in the news. A blue bead popped out and climbed onto Seo-jun\u2019s hand. Seo-joon looked at his abilities.[Hatchling Blue Dragon\u2019s Aura, middle level]This is Hatchling Blue Dragon\u2019s AuraIts Aura alone shows the difference in \u2018class\u2019.\u201cHuh?\u201dIts Dragon Grief, which seemed like a constraint to Seojun, disappeared.Now he can use this ability without hiding behind anyone. Seojun, who was looking at the newly added book and beads, shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s really cool. Oh, then\u2026.\u201dSeojun took a book.The life of [Spirit of the Stick] where [Connection of Orchestra Conductors] ability came from had risen from the lowest to the lower level.In [Spirit of the Stick]\u2019s book, which he looked for and took out, there was a short increase in the level. There was no additional story about the fairy of the stick. Seojun, who was contemplating, gave the answer.\u201cBooks are life, so they are separate from the upgrade in terms of ability.\u201dHatchling achieved his dream but using his ability.The library of life, which judged it as Hatchling\u2019s life, reflected it on the book.However, the case of the spirit of the stick was different. The rise of his will and ability was completely irrelevant to his story, so there was no additional line about the spirit of the stick.\u201cThen if you destroy the world through the connection of an orchestra conductor, it would be written down in the book.\u201dUnlike the world made up of music, can a complex modern society collapse with this small ability, even if it is just musical ability?\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201dSeojun closed the book and looked through another bookshelf.\u201cI guess I\u2019ve solved the questions regarding the Hatchling. Now, I need to find an ability to use at the fan meeting.\u2019He wanted to show a great performance only for his fans, those who couldn\u2019t watch him in the play. Seojun turned his eyes and searched the library of life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With the same format, the DVD of the play has also it\u2019s own photobook, photo cards, posters and etc. Rather than using Album to represent it, I will be using DVD because it is not an album.[Hello! We will be interviewing the actors who acted in the play \u201cSpring\u201d together with actor Lee Seojun.]\u201cAn interview. Isn\u2019t it too fast?\u201dSeojun, who was busy signing the DVD for the fan meeting, looked surprised as he watched the TV.It was only 15 days ago when Najin\u2019s real identity was known to the public, and even the news would constantly talk about it.\u201cThis is faster than from the Wind Theater, but it\u2019s a little late compared to usual. They probably thought about who to interview after watching the VOD that came out a few days ago.\u201dSitting next to him, An Daho pushed new DVD and removed the other signed one and placed it on the floor of the living room so that the ink would dry without spreading.There were pictures of Blue Dragon drawn by Seojun himself with autographs written on them all over the living room.The blue ink signed on the DVD glistened.[Ocean slime\u2019s lucky ink \u2013 Lower Level]It is an ink made of sea slime that can only be seen by accumulating a lot of virtue.The myth of good luck eventually became true.The ink used brings unexpected luck.Usage: Hold the ink tightly with both hands.When he discovered and read the life of [Sea Slime], he was a little reluctant. This was because the raw material of the ink would be infused with some of the slime.Just like squeezing a soaked towel, he needed to squeeze a part of his body so he could get some slime extract.\u201cI\u2019m glad that I just squeeze my finger. If I needed something like blood, I might not have used it.\u201dSeojun pretended to wipe off cold sweat and moved his hands again. He hope his fans who will received the autographs will become lucky. He took turned off all his abilities just to increase the probability of activation as much as possible, no matter how low-level it is. It\u2019s ability can\u2019t be crooked.After a few minutes, Seojun\u2019s hand, which had been moving skillfully since this morning, stopped.An Daho looked at Seojun and the remaining DVD to autograph. Seojun\u2019s eyes were on television.There was an acting school presented on the television, and apparently, it was the academy where So-young and Da-jin attended. He remembered the two people who were always grumbling about how their classes were too hard.On the staircase wall going up to the second floor, there was a picture taken together with Seojun. The reporter interviewed the principal of the academy, and soon Choi So-young and Lee Da-jin also appeared on the screen.[Hello, actor Choi So-Young, actor Lee Da-jin]The two laughed with shy faces at the reporter\u2019s words.It\u2019s been 15 days since the play ended. Seojun smiled brightly at the faces of the two people he hadn\u2019t seen for a long time.[A few days ago, the play \u2018Spring\u2019 DVD and VOD were released. The compliments poured out on all actors were great. There was also an opinion that it felt like they weren\u2019t watching children acting but adult acting as children. I really enjoyed watching it too.]The two smiled broadly and thanked the reporter for the compliment. Rather than DVDs that take time to be deliver, there were many people who watched had VODs where they could be watched comfortably as long as one has internet connection.In less than 24 hours since the sale began, both the VideoTree and Milky Way website, where the VODs could be downloaded, were surprised at the increasing amount every minutes.Seojun and his parents also received a copy of the DVDs, but still bought the VOD. It was definitely more comfortable to watch it one the television.VOD was uploaded under the name of [Children\u2019s Play \u201cSpring\u201d, and short previews edited out of the play were free of charge, from the first to the eighth], like films this could be downloaded by paying the fee.Not only the play but also the behind the stage documentary recorded a high number of downloads.[We didn\u2019t know how we were able to act good on stage, I just enjoyed acting without any pressure.]At Lee Da-jin\u2019s words, Choi So-Young nodded.Seojun\u2019s attention was on the interview of the two and stopped moving his hands.An Daho didn\u2019t rush him and went to watch the interview together.The tip of Seojun\u2019s nose turned sour for no reason at the sight of Lee Da-jin talking excitedly and Choi So-young calmly answering with a shy face.He picked up the cell phone next to him and called them.\u201cDa-jin!

Did they edited out to make it real?But when I look at it again, it was the same as from the other episodes, but I can\u2019t still forget how it was when I first watch it, I thought it was really alive.Did something wrong happened with my eyes after watching the 8th episode? Was I hallucinating? Or did computer technology develop so much that it looks like CG only when you watch it for the first time?]-There\u2019s no skill like that!-But it\u2019s really fascinating. When I first watch it too, I thought it was really a dragon.-There\u2019s something like that? I didn\u2019t see it.[Title: How about this? 8th episode was like thisI drew it. It really feels like I was watching a real dragon acting on stage.(drawing: A dragon flying in the sky with its head inside the Milky Way and its body and tail outside the Milky Way.)This is how I visualize the dragon. It\u2019s head should be as big as the theater.]\u2013 Isn\u2019t this better than that dark one? The body and tail look like clouds\u2013 The theater where \u2018Spring\u2019 came from was different. You have to do it the other way around.-Like this? (Photo)-Who drew this as a cartoon?* * *\u201cDaho, did you see this?\u201dSeojun showed him his cell phone. Although his arm did not reach the driver\u2019s seat because he was sitting in the car seat. An Daho made eye contact with Seojun through the driver\u2019s mirror.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cSpring cartoon!\u201d\u201cOh, I saw it too. The artist did a great job\u201d.\u201cRight? Isn\u2019t it especially cute when a blue dragon pierces the wall of the Milky Way\u00a0 with his head while looking for Spring to grant his wish? He even have a bump on his head.\u201d\u201cThat cartoon is really popular.\u201dToday was Seojun\u2019s first fan meeting day.Sitting in the car seat, Seojun hummed while looking out the window, or reading comments from his fan cafe on his cell phone.A comment caught his attention.\u201cHyung! There are people who already arrived.\u201d\u201cReally? We still have a long way to go before that fan meeting starts\u2026.\u201d\u201cHey, how\u2019s the weather today? If they arrive earlier, they should still be outside.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little cloudy, but I don\u2019t think it would be raining on the fan meeting\u2019s location. It doesn\u2019t matter anyway because it\u2019s indoors, but it is another matter if they wait outside while it is still raining.Seojun sighed a relief at An Daho\u2019s words. It is good that there would be no rain.Seojun stamped his feet to ease the tension. An Daho laughed at the sight of Seojun shaking his legs here and there.He heard from Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon that Seojun would usually do this because he is preventing himself from sleeping.\u201cI heard you slept late last night. How about sleeping in the car?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay! I can\u2019t sleep at all!\u201dLiterally, Seojun\u2019s eyes sparkled. It was all thanks to his ability.As he approached the fan meeting venue, they could see people wearing strange hats, clothes, and bags.Seo-jun, who had his nose attached at the black tinted window, looked outside.\u201cOh, that\u2019s uncle Hee-sung products! That\u2019s the same as mine!\u201dThere were also people wearing goblin-shaped bag that Seojun would usually carry to the set. There were also people with their bags that has monster doll as key chain and also those with a metal badge on their chest. Seojun\u2019s heart start beating fast.\u201cAre these all my fans?\u201d\u201cYeah. I guess everyone here will be attending your fan meeting.\u201dOne fan couldn\u2019t take his eyes off from the badge on the fan\u2019s bag. Seojun frowned. He can\u2019t see what was the badge.The fan hesitated and eventually knocked on the other fan\u2019s shoulder and made gestures. Perhaps it was asking where the badge was bought.Seojun smiled brightly at the interractions of the two fans heading to the fan meeting together as if they were long time friends.\u2018I don\u2019t know what badge it is, but I\u2019m so happy that they became all close!\u2019Seojun\u2019s car stopped in the underground parking lot.Seojun got out of the car with full of energy. His uncle was waiting them in front.\u201cUncle!\u201d\u201cSeojun is here! Let\u2019s go up!\u201dSeojun, Seo Eun-chan, and An Daho headed upstairs. They saw staff running around here and there. When they made eye contact with Seojun, they either waved or bowed.\u201cWhen you go out of the theater after the fan meeting, you will give the fans the autographed DVD, and gifts. You\u2019ll also give them snacks during the break.\u201d Seo Eun-Chan explained slowly to Seojun.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cDo you remember the order of events?\u201dSeojun nodded at Seo Eun-chan\u2019s question.The three entered the waiting room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because this is Android, I can\u2019t retrieve the data from my lost IOS phone. So I will be retranslating them. I will be doing 2 new chapters everyday to make it up. Anyway, there are still 10 chapters till the translator change. From chapter 100 it would be another translator, we will be seeing you again on chapter 150. Well, you may not notice it when we change translator because only Karnevale\u2019s admin will appear as the author of the chapter.The room has many drinks, snacks, and also a small bed where Seojun could relax comfortably. Seo Eun-chan made eye contact with Seojun and said.\u201cSeojun, tell me if you\u2019re tired while in the fan meeting, you can ask for break time anytime. Got it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay! I\u2019m really strong!\u201d\u201cStill!\u201dSeo Eun-chan disheveled his hair, while Seojun just laughed.Knock knock~\u201cYes, come on in.\u201dAt Seo Eun-chan\u2019s words, someone opened the door and came in.Seojun smiled seeing it was from a familiar face.\u201cSo-Young noona!\u201d\u201cHi, Seojun!\u201d\u201cWe invited her to recreate the Blue Dragon Scene in front of your fans.\u00a0 And the MC is\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cTa-da! It\u2019s me!\u201d\u201cDa-jin!\u201dLee Da-jin appeared behind Choi So-young. Several weeks have already passed since the play ended.Their interview proposal decreased, while drama scripts poured out.A proposal came from Cocoa Entertainment to the two people. They invited Choi So-young and Lee Da-jin for the Fan meeting and they happily accepted the proposal.\u201cI should be on V-LIVE\u201d. (TL: V-LIVE is a platform used by celebrities to do a Livestream.)Choi So-young and Seojun burst into laughter at Lee Da-jin\u2019s words. The three kids met each other after a long time talked with a smile on what was so fun.* * *As time passed by, the theater was full of people. The fans waited for the fan meeting to begin with their face full of expectations.\u201cAn MC will appear, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to held a fan meeting alone.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who would be the MC. I hope he is good.\u201dThe fan meeting was a place where fans and celebrities get closer rather. There are cases where the MC just make things awkward between the fans and idol.\u201cJust like Hwang Yejun from Vevele. They might tell us a story about Seojun that we don\u2019t know and force us to laugh at an inside joke.\u201d\u201cAnyways, please. I want the MC with good understanding of the atmosphere.\u201dEveryone held their hands tightly and prayed.When it was time to start the fan meeting, the stage brightened and someone appeared.\u201cHello!\u201dA girl stood on the stage. Everyone was puzzled by the appearance of the MC, who was younger than expected, and noticed that the girl was Lee Da-jin.(TL: It is only revealed here that Da-jin is actually a female. In the previous chapters the author didn\u2019t use a specific gender pronouns when referring to her, only neutral ones. In a Children Play, especially in Korea, the hunter role goes to Male ones that\u2019s why I thought immediately that Da-jin was a male. Also Da-jin is a neutral name. Unlike So-Young.)They were fans who watched from episodes 1 to 8 as well as the Behind the Scenes for several times.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about chemistry.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a really funny kid, too.\u201dFans burst into laughter at the silly middle school student\u2019s face.\u201cThere are so many people here. Ah, I am not supposed to say this. Hello, I\u2019m Lee Da-jin, the MC of actor Lee Seojun\u2019s first fan meeting. I don\u2019t know if you know me, but I acted in the same play with Seojun!\u201dSeo Eun-chan smiled while standing behind the stage.\u201cShe is good.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of people, but she is not nervous. She is good at entertaining too.\u201dAt Cocoa Entertainment, the planning team leader, who plans events such as Brown Black\u2019s concerts and fan meetings, judged as he watch Lee Da-jin.Choi So-young and Seojun shook their heads at the words.\u201cDa-jin is just saying it without much thought.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, So-Young noona.\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m glad that she is like that. Otherwise, I\u2019d be in trouble already.\u201d\u201cBut I guess Da-jin must be really excited.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s an attention seeker.\u201dWhile the two were whispering to each other, Lee Da-jin continued to speak.\u201cAre you all here to see Seojun? It\u2019s been a while since you saw him. Then should we hurry up and call actor Lee Seojun up? Seojun! Hurry up and come out!\u201dEveryone burst into laughter at the way she spoke. Some fans followed Lee Da-jin and shouted \u201cSeojun!\u201dPerhaps because it was a fan meeting of a child actor, it felt more cuter than usual fan meetings.Seojun\u2019s fans, whose heart was initially about to burst with anticipation, relaxed with at Lee Da-jin\u2019s intro.\u201cLook. It\u2019s totally different from the script.\u201d\u201cChoi So-Young, hurry up and come out. Lee Seojun you will follow!\u201d\u201cNoona, let\u2019s hurry up and go. I don\u2019t know what would happen next.\u201dThe planning team leader felt he was stabbed in the back by Lee Da-jin\u2019s start out of the script. While, Seojun burst into laughter at Seo Eun-chan\u2019s absent-minded face as he led Choi So-young to the center of the stage.When Seojun, who the fans been waiting for, appeared on a big stage. Everyone screamed.\u201cKyaaah! So cute!\u201dSeojun turned on the microphone he was holding and bowed.[Seojun! I love you!] Fans holding the banner were shaking their hands while shouting. While fans, who brought the monster dolls that Seojun likes, were waving the monster dolls above their heads.Seojun\u2019s heart fluttered at the sight of his fans.\u201cHello, I\u2019m actor Lee Seojun!\u201d\u201cHi Seojun!\u201dWhen Seojun smiled brightly, the sound of being pain came out from all over the place.Seojun\u2019s face was also zoomed in on the screen installed behind the stage.When Lee Da-jin, who noticed the screen, tapped Seojun. Seojun turned his head toward her.Everyone burst into laughter when Seojun\u2019s round back of the head was seen on the big screen.\u201cLet\u2019s have fun today!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLee Da-jin picked up a square cue card. Choi So-young and Lee Seojun sat in their already prepared chair.\u201cFirst of all, I heard that Seojun is a good singer.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cShall we listen to your singing first first?\u201dSeojun stood with a microphone.He don\u2019t know what song will come out, but Uncle Chan said he knows the song well. It was clear that it was probably either Brown Black\u2019s song or a famous song.Music came out of the speaker.It was the Children Song,\u00a0Hey\u00a0Tayo!Hey Tayo?Seojun was confused on why this song came out.Fans burst into laughter when they saw the screen. Seojun turned his head and directed his gaze at the screen.Characters that he watch a lot on TV were running around. The lyrics of the song were written below it.\u2018Hey Tayo!\u2019 was a theme song for a cartoon that was really popular among children.Lee Da-jin and Choi So-young were already hitting the floor while tearing because they really find him funny.Seo Eun-chan was covering his mouth as he resisted himself from laughing.While looking at the people laughing around, Seojun casually opened his mouth to start singing.\u201cHey Tayo, hey tayo!\u201dHe sings well, but it can be seen that he was kind of pissed off. His anger was only toward one person. Seo Eun-chan shuddered with the cruelty pouring into him.This was not a joke by Seo Eun-chan, but it was the most voted song on Seojun\u2019s fan cafe.Fans, Lee Da-jin and Choi So-young sang along. Seojun soon let go his anger and sang excitedly.Well, it was a song that he often sang in kindergarten. It was a little weird to sing it as an elementary school student, but it\u2019s fun to sing it after a long time.\u201cLet\u2019s clap!\u201dCheers poured out. Seojun sat on a chair while scratching his cheek.\u201cNext would be answering questions from the fans.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA staff brought a box full of paper with questions on the stage. Seojun put his hand in and take out a piece of paper.Lee Da-jin, who received the paper, read the question.Some fans expected their questions to be selected, while others wanted to know Seojun\u2019s answer.Seojun answered each question sincerely. He felt the interest of the fans in each of the questions.The meaningful question time was coming to an end.\u201cOh, this is too much.\u201dLee Da-jin, who read the last paper Seojun took out, shook her head.Seo Eun-chan turned his head and look at the planning team leader. The planning team leader shook his head in a hurry.\u201cI filtered everything out.\u201d\u201cBut what kind of\u2026\u2026.\u201dLee Da-jin opened her mouth even before Seo Eun-chan could ask him.\u201cWho do you like more mom or dad?\u201dAt the question, the fans burst into laughter.Some were not too happy at the question, but it did not hide the tips of their lips going up. Among them, there were also people that wanted to know what would be his answer. Lee Da-jin and Choi So-young were also among those people who are curious about what would he say.Seojun\u2019s eyes fluctuated. Everyone couldn\u2019t hold back their laughter at the sight of a young boy who looked like he was answering a college exam.They wondered if this question was very difficult for Lee Seojun.Once again, Seojun\u2019s eyes was directed towards the backstage. Seo Eun-chan, who was giggling, caught Seojun\u2019s eyes.Seo Eun-chan, who felt like he had made eye contact with Seojun, immediately change his expression to a poker face, but Seojun had already seen him enjoying his suffering.\u2018There\u2019s no way my fans would ask me this question, so this must be uncle Chan\u2019s fault!\u2019Seojun made such conclusion.\u201cSeo, Eun, Chan. Uncle is my favorite!\u201d\u201cOh! Not his mom or dad, but his uncle?\u201d\u201cHis Uncle must be really happy!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Superstar From Age 0CH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone burst into laughter at Seojun\u2019s avoidance, and Seo Eun-chan hoped that Seojun\u2019s answer would not reach the ears of his sister and brother-in-law. An Daho, who was watching it behind the President, shook his head.After the Q&amp;A, the time that everyone had been waiting for came. The chair was take out, Choi So-young and Seojun stood facing each other.Lee Da-jin held the microphone and told them the rough plot about the play. Everyone watched VOD because they were Seojun\u2019s fans, but they still listened to Lee Da-jin\u2019s voice.This was the first and last acting where Seojun and Choi So-young stood face to face. It would always been Seojun behind the wall while So-Young was on the stage.\u2018He was more amazing during the performance than during practice. We can\u2019t show it to the fans. It\u2019s a bummer, but he is still amazing during practice.\u2019When Lee Da-jin\u2019s explanation was over, Choi So-young acted her lines.They were an empty stage without stage decorations, or props, so it was difficult to immerse herself, but she did her best.She was most confident in this role.\u201cBlue Dragon! Blue Dragon!\u201dSeojun opened his mouth while holding the microphone in front of everyone. Neither the hair nor his eyes color changed. There were also no horns and no scales.[Hatchling Blue Dragon\u2019s aura]But his skills are still the same![Thank you! I\u2019ll grant your wish!]Fans trembled at Seojun\u2019s voice.It was different from when they watched the VOD. Of course, the VOD was still impressive, but Seojun\u2019s acting in person seemed to make his whole body cry through the speaker. They understood why the high school student watched the same play eight times.It was a pity that they couldn\u2019t even watch the play in person, but it was a relief that they came to the fan meeting.[Hahaha]There seemed to be a cool wind blowing somewhere. Fans who were still in the mood woke up.Lee Da-jin smiled brightly and said.\u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing? It\u2019s my first time seeing an actor who acts well like Seojun.\u201d\u201cRight!\u201d\u201cSeojun is a Genius!\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dSeojun bowed and sat down.Lee Da-jin read the cue card.\u201cUnfortunately, part 1 ends here. Let\u2019s take a break for a while and continue in a while. Everyone, please wait a little bit.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThanks to the notice issued in advance by the Cocoa Entertainment, everyone leaned comfortably on the chair. They didn\u2019t want to miss any of Seojun\u2019s actions, so they focused hard and felt stiff all over their necks.Some took out their cell phones and posted reviews of the first part of the fan meeting, and some took photos.\u201cWow. It was amazing.\u201dLee Mi-yeon, a fan of Brown Black and a fan of Lee Seojun, spoke to the person sitting next to her. Kang So-ra, a fan sitting next to her, nodded.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between VOD and his acting face to face.\u201d\u201cBut that badge\u2026 is really cute.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit expensive because it\u2019s custom-made, but I\u2019ll send you a picture, so you could ask it to be made.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLee Mi-yeon looked at Kang Sora\u2019s badge. It was from Seojun\u2019s first Advertisement, which was stopped to be broadcasted now due to image quality and regulations.It was a badge engraved with the baby Seojun\u2019s photo at the time of filming.She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off from the vivid cuteness even when she saw it walking on the street.\u201cOh, I guess this is the snack.\u201dFruit lunch boxes came over and were distributed to each fans.Lee Mi-yeon opened the lid of a fruit lunch box. They were seasonal fruits. They were all sliced and mixed up.\u201cThe fan meeting ticket was cheap, but they gave snacks and later they will also give Seojun\u2019s autograph. I know that the rental fee here is expensive, but it\u2019s really that they did this.\u201d\u201cThey are not doing this to make money.\u201d\u201cIf they were doing it to make money, they wouldn\u2019t have added a part of the play in the event.\u201dIt was the first time they met, but the two enjoyed talking to each other. Someone appeared on the stage while continuing to talk about movies and dramas starring Seoju. There was some time left before they re-start.Kim Soo-Ryeon came up to the stage.All the fans, who were busy chatting to each other other earlier, returned their gaze toward the stage. Team leader Kim Soo-Ryeon smiled slightly at the sight.\u201cHello, fans.\u201d\u201cHello~\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Kim Soo-Ryeon, the head of Cocoa Entertainment\u2019s public relations team. I wanted to share good news with you, so I came up on stage like this.\u201d\u201cGood news?\u201dThe fans were confused.Cocoa Entertainment was turned upside down by the news from the United States a while ago.An employee of the company delivered it to Kim Soo-Ryeon, and Kim Soo-ryeon delivered it to Seo Eun-chan, the president.Seo Eun-chan did not understand until he searched several times on his cell phone..Kim Soo-ryeon, the head of the public relations team, continued.\u201cThis is a fact that even actor Lee Seo-joon does not know yet. I just got a call. I really want the fans to deliver it to actor Lee Seojun.\u201dFans swallowed their saliva at Kim Soo-Ryeon\u2019s excited but serious expression. The loud and spacious concert hall became quiet.On second thought, this was very thrilling. He remembered the voice of an employee shaking but delivering it as if he couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cLee Seojun has been nominated for the notable actor award at the WTV Film Festival in the U.S.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSoon there were murmurs from all over the place.The U.S.? WTV Film Festival? Awards? Candidates?Slowly, the fans were understanding each word and opened their mouths wide.Team leader Kim Soo-Ryeon continued to speak seeing the expressions of fans who roughly understood.\u201cOf course, the winner has not been decided yet, but it\u2019s great to just be nominated as it\u2019s an overseas film festival. Please deliver it to actor Lee Seojun later on.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cWow!!\u201dOverseas film festivals!\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201cI thought he\u2019d get it someday! But I didn\u2019t know it was this fast!\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s an overseas movie this year, it\u2019s that, right?\u201d\u201cShadowman!\u201d\u201cJin natra!\u201d\u201cHe deserves it!\u201dThe concert hall has become more noisy than a while ago. Fans\u2019 cheers were delivered to the waiting room where Seojun was located.Seojun, who was putting sugar on the chocolate milk, tilted his head.Choi So-young and Lee Da-jin also filled their stomachs with sandwiches and juice.\u201cWhat are they talking about? Is there problem?\u201d\u201cNo. Nothing.\u201dStylist and staff, who had already heard the news, all smiled as they watch Seojun.Squeeze- Seojun, who was drinking his chocolate milk, opened his eyes.\u2018No, they are hiding something.\u2019When he look at them, they only know how to fake their work. Some was on their cellphone, others were fakely talking and some run away.\u2018This is really weird!\u2019\u201cHey, Seojun! A lot of fans are here.\u201dThe easiest prey came on its own. Seojun smiled broadly at Seo Eun-chan\u2019s appearance.Everyone was shaking their heads when they noticed it.\u201cUncle, you\u2019re hiding something from me, right?\u201d\u201cWhat? What\u2026 No\u2026\u201d Seo Eun-chan was clearly avoiding him.Seojun turned his head around and stared at Seo Eun-chan. He has already told Kim Soo-Ryeon to tell his fans that Seo-joon doesn\u2019t know. He can\u2019t afford to tell it to Seojun now.\u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201d\u201cSeojun, you have to go on stage now.\u201dSeo Eun-chan, who was being questioned, was saved thanks to An Daho at the good timing. He breathed a sigh of relief.Seojun did not take his eyes off from Seo Eun-chan as he went out of the waiting room in the hands of An Daho.\u2018How many times did I have a hard time because of uncle today?\u2019Seo Eun-chan continued to sweat from being stared by his nephew.\u201cI\u2019m going to watch you. Uncle.\u201dSeojun grinded his teeth slightly.\u201cHa ha ha. Good luck.\u201dThe door of the waiting room was closed. Choi So-young and Lee Da-jin, who had already been outside, also smiled broadly at Seojun as they already heard it from the staff.\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing.\u2019Seojun headed to the concert hall holding An Daho\u2019s hand, looking at Choi So-young and Lee Da-jin.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cHmm. Something really good. The fans will tell you soon.\u201dWhen Seojun appeared on the stage, fans shouted without any signal.Seojun held the microphone.

The ones who came out in the spring were MCs.A notice posted by Cocoa Entertainment was posted on the fan cafe.-Is it a notice for the next fan meeting?When they clicked on it, there was a huge news waiting.A while ago.An employee of the public relations team who delivered the news to team leader Kim Soo-Ryeon contacted many media outlet to distribute the news under the direction of Seo Eun-chan.Since it was an idol agency, everyone was not interested about the overseas film festivals, so they just found out that the WTV Film Festival decides the winner through viewers\u2019 \u201cvoting.\u201dVote!This same word stimulates fans\u2019 peripheral nerves!It is an indicator of fans\u2019 love for celebrities, and the act that a fan would have done once, causing controversy over manipulation due to all kinds of doings.The terrifying thing about voting is that the winner and the loser can be determined by only just one vote.\u201cCEO, shall we post it on the fan cafe first?\u201dLooking at his nephew standing on the stage, Seo Eun-chan said to a public relations\u2019 employee across his cell phone.\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019ve informed all the fans here, so before we release it to the media, post it on the fan cafe first. If this gets known late, they will say something about the company being lazy.

The fans of the actors nominated together with him are also formidable. The fact that he is older than Seojun and works in the U.S. is the biggest obstacle.\u201dAt Seo Eun-chan\u2019s words, the public relations team staff took a deep breath.

He was nominated because of the character! They applauded with admiration.Seojun was so excited that he just smiled. He felt like he was floating on clouds in the entire fan meeting. But he still didn\u2019t forget what to do.Seojun held the fan meeting in the order to meet his fans so he should do his very best as their Idol.Some fans were selected, received gifts, shook hands with, and chatted with each other while sitting in a soft chair.He talked about the time he was in the United States, his friends, and about his time in the play \u2018Spring\u2019.It was just a simple narration of his daily life, but it was fun. The fans also laughed happily and listened to his story.The fan meeting is almost over.\u201cHow was it, everyone?\u201dLee Da-jin and Choi So-young went down and Seojun stood alone on the stage. Seojun, was smiling in the spotlight alone, shone.\u201cI was so excited about my nomination that I don\u2019t know if I acted properly.\u201d\u201cNo! It was cool!\u201d\u201cGood job!\u201dSeojun smiled and looked at the audience. Everyone was happy that Seojun was nominated as if it they were the one nominated.Throughout the fan meeting, he looked through the audience to see if there was anyone who didn\u2019t like it, but everyone was looking at Seojun with a happy and satisfied look.Seojun slowly look at the whole audience as if he was making eye contact with each one, suddenly he wondered if he had a fan in his first life.\u2018If I had, wouldn\u2019t they have cried watching me die? I am now worried. But it would have been great if at least one person was a fan of mine in my first life.\u2026.\u2019Seojun shook off his negatives and only looked at his fans now. Then, he bowed.\u2018My first life was my first life, and now I should be only thinking about my fans here!\u2019Seojun smiled broadly.\u201cThank you so much for coming today. Please continue to show your support and love to me!\u201d\u2013 Seojun! Congratulations on your nomination!-It was fun today!Seojun went down from the stage while the exit opened.The staff in front of the door handed out paper bags to each of the fans one by one.The gifts they brought were carefully prepared in a box. They contained autographed DVDs and other bundles of Seojun\u2019s. The fans quickly turned on their phone and took a picture of it as soon as they left the fan meeting venue.They turned on their cell phone to brag to their friend.\u201cOh, I\u2019m done now.\u201d\u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201cIt was so much fun! Seojun\u2019s acting in person was no joke. His role as Blue dragon\u00a0 is only his voice, but it was amazing. Oh, and Seojun was nominated for an overseas film festival, right?

Your fans need go into the website and vote.\u201d\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you say that before?\u201dHe separated with the two friends from \u2018Spring\u2019 play and An Daho, together with other employees, left for more work. They decided that he will go home with his uncle Chan today. Seo Eun-chan drove Seojun\u2019s car and went home.Seojun looked suspiciously toward Seo Eun-chan.\u201cIf we announced it during the fan meeting, everyone would have been busy voting. In addition, it would look like a fan meeting that encouraged voting. Seojun, you held the fan meeting for your fans, so posting it on the fan cafe is enough.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cUncle did you already vote?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dSeojun thought about it.\u2018Should I ask about the voting status or not? I\u2019m curious, but it would be disappointing if I was in last place.\u2019Ring ring.At that time, the cell phone rang. It was Seo Eun-Hye\u2019s text. Seojun read his mother\u2019s text. Seo Eun-chan asked.\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\u201cBuy a cake to celebrate your nomination! Something you like! If there\u2019s something you want to eat, buy it also!\u201d\u201cReally? We need to go to a good bakery, hmm?\u201d\u201cUncle, uncle. Let\u2019s buy chicken too!\u201d\u201cCake and chicken. Yes, eat as much as you want! Uncle will treat you today!\u201dWhile Seojun was excited by Seo Eun-chan\u2019s words and went to buy chocolate cake, the Internet was busy voting.-If you\u2019re Korean, you have to vote! Lee Seojun!\u2013 I didn\u2019t know there was a film festival like this.\u2013 Vote! Let\u2019s vote!-Shadowman also voted!-No way. The site went down.\u2013 Brown Black and Lee Ji-seok\u2019s fan cafe are also going crazy.-I don\u2019t know anything else, but Brown Black fans are used to it because of the music program, so I think it\u2019ll be very easy.Above Seojun\u2019s fan cafe, there was a large letter written.[Our actor\u2019s first nomination ever! Let\u2019s take it with our hands!]* * *As the awards ceremony approached, everyone voted till the last day. In particular, Cocoa Entertainment\u2019 s public relations team and Lee Seojun\u2019s team 2 were extremely busy.\u201cIt\u2019s a private vote, so we don\u2019t know how many votes at we are now. We worked really hard to promote it.\u2026 I think we\u2019ll get it, right?\u201d\u201cI know. If we get the award, we\u2019ll be busier than this, right?\u201dThe public relations team distributed promotional materials here and there to encourage voting, and team 2 was busy rejecting interviews and broadcast proposals.Seojun may win the award, so he wanted to make a documentary by putting all the videos done at home by his parents and editing them. In addition, there were calls asking him to appear on variety shows. Most were interview requests.First of all, the scheduled interview with the three public broadcasting stations, where Seojun decided to appear, was changed to after the awards ceremony. The rest were rejected.(TL: Major Channels in Korea are KBS, SBS and MBC)\u201cAren\u2019t documentaries boring?\u201d\u201cThis depends on the topic. If you are interested it will be interesting, but Seojun\u2019s documentary is no different from an interview.\u201dThe employee who was scrolling through SNS saw a news that caught his eyes\u201cHey, the reporters are at the airport.\u201dA photo taken by a person leaving the country today was posted on SNS. Reporters with large cameras were waiting at the airport\u2019s international entrance.\u201cThey don\u2019t know when Seojun will go in America, so they are waiting.\u201d\u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t announce the date of his flight.\u201dAs Seojun was nominated, the enthusiasm to cover it heated up. If he did something wrong because of the heat\u2026 It would become a scandal. Cocoa Entertainment\u2019s wishes to leave the country as secret as possible.\u201cI think this is going to be hard.\u201dEun-chan sighed seeing the situation around the airport coming up here and there on the internet.\u201cLet\u2019s try this on.\u201dSeo Eun-chan and An Daho took out hats, masks, and colorful clothes from their bags. Seojun stared at the accessories that the two took out.He didn\u2019t know anything about fashion, and he just wear exactly what his mom and dad would give him, but this was too much.Seojun\u2019s lips became pouty looking at the bright yellow and blue colors that hurt his eyes. This were clothes that even kindergartens would not wear.\u201cI don\u2019t want to wear this.\u201d\u201cNo. Seojun, you have to wear this.\u201dSeojun thought it was a joke as always, but when Seo Eun-chan spoke with a serious face, Seojun was confused.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there something wrong?\u201dSeo Eun-chan frowned, and An Daho sighed without realizing it.\u201cAll the reporters are at the airport. Seojun, we need to take a plane to go to the film festival in the United States, so I think they had find out every flight scheduled to America around the time of the awards ceremony.\u201d\u201cI think they would wait there till the day of the ceremony.\u201dSeojun and his parents were speechless. In that appearance, Seo Eun-chan took out his cell phone. He showed them photos and comments screenshots on the smartphone screen.\u201cSNS is a mess too. If Seojun gets hurt, he\u2019ll be in big trouble. Also Cocoa Entertainment\u2019s reputation would be damaged if he has no bodyguards.\u201d\u201cWe already hired someone as bodyguard.\u201dThe couple and Seojun, who were happy to go to the U.S., closed their mouths and listened to Seo Eun-chan and An Daho\u2019s explanation. Seo Eun-chan rubbed his head as if he was in trouble.\u201cI think we should go to the U.S. as soon as possible because I see some signs of people crowding the airport few days before the award ceremony. If Seojun wear something like this, people won\u2019t think it\u2019s Seojun.\u201d\u201cWhat kid would wear that?\u201d\u201cReporters are blending with the crowd while covering their faces and taking pictures of any kids the size of Seojun. If he wear something like this, it will not catch their eye.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\u201cThen can you just let me know when we are leaving?\u201dFour people look Seojun at his question.\u201cThen the airport guests would not become uncomfortable because of the reporters and there would be no other children to be pictured. Wouldn\u2019t it be okay if we prepare now and go?\u201dSeo Eun-chan and An Daho were lost in thought at Seojun\u2019s words. Then they sighed.\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m just worried because Seojun has never encountered reporters and fans that close.\u201d\u201cMore than the fan meeting?\u201d\u201cIt may be less than then that, but in the fan meetings all people like you. In addition, everyone was sitting down so it was safe. But there would be now boundary at the airport, so I\u2019m worried that you will be mobbed and pushed because you are small and easily hurt by others.\u201dWas it an illusion that his uncle specifically pointed out the word small? Seojun, the tallest in his class, said.\u201cI\u2019m fine. There will be a lot of reporters at the film festival anyway, and when I return from the U.S., there will be more reporters! I\u2019ll think of it as a pre-experience!\u201dSeo Eun-chan\u2019s eyes turned towards the couple. Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon were in conflict.\u201cWhat about Seojun\u2019s safety?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll hire a lot of bodyguards, and I think it\u2019ll be okay if we cooperate with the airport and make a separate photo zone.\u201d\u201cEUN-CHAN, which one do you think is better?\u201d\u201cIf you say you can control it, you\u2019d better just say it. If we go in secretly, there will be fewer bodyguards, so if anyone notices, it will be more dangerous.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s just reveal it.\u201dWith the permission of the couple and Seojun, Seojun\u2019s departure date and time were uploaded at Seojun\u2019s fan cafe.The announcement was immediately published, and reporters waiting at the airport also left one by one.There were also reporters who doubted it, but everyone withdrew because they know they would never deceive their fans.The airport became peaceful again.* * *It was now the day to leave the country to attend the WTV Film Festival. Seo Eun-chan and An Daho came to Seojun\u2019s house early.\u201cMy sister and brother-in-law will go to the airport first.\u201dLee Min-Joon, who was checking whether there was anything missing also whether the gas was properly turned off, tilted his head at Seo Eun-chan\u2019s words.\u201cDo you want us to go first?\u201d\u201cYes, they don\u2019t know the faces of my sister and brother-in-law, so it\u2019ll be okay. However, if you go with Seojun, your face will be photographed, and it will become harder to focus on protecting three people at once.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re right.\u201dThe couple nodded. Seo Eun-chan sighed with his arms folded.\u201cI\u2019m a little relieved because the fans are telling us to be careful\u2026 But I\u2019m still worried.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201dSeojun said with a big smile.\u201cFans are so nice!\u201d\u201cWell, even if you meet them one by one, they\u2019ll be nice, but we don\u2019t know what will happen when they are banded together.\u201dIt was clear that if anyone moved a little, there would just follow. This is called crowd psychology, and it was a very scary.Seo Eun-chan recalled Brown Black\u2019s first flight and shuddered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is that Seojun\u2019s?\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s right. Wow. That must have been really expensive.\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs expected, he is a Hollywood star.\u201dA large black car slid in. Reporters waiting outside pressed the shutters continuously and fans, standing together, screamed.In the meantime, the bodyguards who were waiting in the airport headed towards the car.\u201cBut there are a lot of fans. He maybe an Hollywood actor, but I thought few fans would come because he is just a child actor.\u201d\u201cLee Seojun is too special to just be called a child actor. Everyone cried about William at least once or was overwhelmed by his shaman role. There are many people who became fans because of his acting during Jin Natra. If you watch that kind of acting, you\u2019ll really want to see it in person.\u201dThe two reporters pressed the shutter hard even in the middle of the conversation. If their title has \u201cLee Seojun\u201d with some of his picture with that large car uploaded, they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the number of views.The bodyguards stood in place, and soon the thick car door opened. A man, who appeared to be a manager, got off first and Seojun went outside with his pastel casual clothes.Seojun smiled brightly as his clothes were much better than those childish clothes suggested by his uncle Chan.An Daho held Seojun\u2019s hand tightly and slowly walked among the bodyguards.Whether he knew the minds of those who were worried about him or not, Seojun smiled and waved his hands towards his fans.The movement rattled the wolf-shaped bag on Seojun\u2019s back. It now became the center of attention of some fans and reporters.\u201cIs that a new Monster\u2019s bag? He must have really like those. I remember someone took a picture of Lee Seojun\u2019s pencil case and posted it on the Internet. It was sold out. Do you think this would also sould out?\u201d\u201cI heard it\u2019s actually Lee Seojun\u2019s father\u2019s company. He founded it together with his friend.\u201dDuring their chatter, the hands of the two people holding the camera did not stop. Fans and reporters also entered the airport following Seojun\u2019s movement.At the airport, other passages were created in advance to prevent damage to customers.\u201cI think his clothes will be having a massive increase in sales. These days, the company released metal badges and fans of Lee Seojun, who can\u2019t use the monster products because they were for children, have also begun to buy them. Oh, that is the one.\u201dA shiny badge was seen in the wolf-shaped bag of Lee Seojun. It was a wolf with sharp teeth. The two took a close-up shot of the badge.\u201cThe children\u2019s parents these days buy a lot of things that Lee Seojun uses. They have this mentality of \u2018It\u2019s an item used by a Hollywood star and he still haven\u2019t filmed any commercials, so it\u2019s more reliable\u2019.\u201d\u201cHis advertisement fee must have been high but they haven\u2019t still accepted any.\u201dSeojun and An Daho went through between the bodyguards.Seojun\u2019s name was being chanted here and there, as they went inside the airport.The normal people that didn\u2019t check the news were confused seeing the crowd and many reporters. They either peeped out their head out of curiosity or searched the Internet.\u201cLee Seojun?!\u201dThere was tension among the increasing number of people and bodyguards. This situation can strain his body because he was just a child. An Daho was also ready to hug Seojun and run when he can\u2019t stand it.When An Daho felt strength in his hand, Seojun smiled as if he was saying it was okay.[Apple flower scent that calms you down][(Calm) Apple flower scent \u2013 Middle level]This was the flower of the apple tree that makes one fall asleep forever.Unlike the poisonous fruits (apples), flowers only have calming effects.(TL: reference in Snow White.)When someone smell the scent, they became calm.There was a story of about a princess of a country could not wake up anymore after eating the apple, thus it the fruit was deemed as poisonous. However, the scent of apple flowers has become a good medicine for people. They are usually made into perfumes and used as sedatives.\u201cIt\u2019s perfect to have this ability at times like this!\u201d\u2019A sweet scent began to flow out from the white apple flower pattern on his wrist. After he took a deep breath, it became more effective.Something began to come out from Seojun, who was just ordinary just a while ago.As reporters and fans who continued to watch Seojun with their cameras, they noticed the change in Seojun. Everyone was unknowingly amazed by the aura flowing out of Seojun\u2019s body.\u201cEven when he is just standing, it feels completely different from an average person.\u201d\u201cMost celebrities don\u2019t have that.\u201dEveryone nodded and the reporters, who usually took pictures of other celebrities, also nodded.There are celebrities who would show their aura even if they dress casually, but not anyone could do that.Even though Lee Seo-jun was only eight years old, he has the aura of a Superstar.\u201cThat\u2019s really cool. He have such a unique aura. How does he live his daily life?\u201d\u201cSniff. But don\u2019t you smell flowers from somewhere?\u201d\u201cFlower scent? I can\u2019t smell it\u201d.Seojun\u2019s fans and reporters, who were diligently taking pictures, sniffed at the sweet scent.As if enchanted, their movements stopped. The heat that was heating up inside the airport also slowly subsided.The sweet scent of the flowers calmed their hearts. But after a second of being in dazed, everyone calmly pressed the shutters continously, perhaps because it couldn\u2019t completely cool off their passion.The nervous bodyguards and An Daho also breathed out slowly after smelling the flower scent to relieve the tension they were feeling.They decided to have a short interview and take a picture on a platform on one side of the airport.When Seojun went up to the podium with a microphone, some of the people who couldn\u2019t hear him shouted, but the person he was embarrassed by the calm atmosphere so he shut his mouth.Seo Eun-chan really cared about Seojun, when the man shouted he felt like his body was drained of blood but seeing that the audience remained calmed, he sighed a relief.\u201cIt\u2019s really effective!\u201dThey have prevented accidents that they were worried about.Seojun was going to say his greetings comfortably and leave for the United States. When Seojun smiled broadly, the camera lenses focused on Seo-joon. The click sound and flash went off.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Lee Seojun.\u201dSeojun nodded.Fans who saw him for the first time in person wanted to grab their hearts and scream as much as they wanted, but the scent of flowers blocked it.The joy of meeting Seojun and the ability to calm them down had the fans have a silent battle. In the end, their mind had reached an agreement to moved both hands, and loud applause erupted from here and there.Clap clap clap clap clap!The calm response of the fans was rather suspicious for the bodyguards and reporters. Some reporters even turned their camera toward the fans.What should they do? It was so peaceful. No one rushed in, and no one shouted out loud.\u00a0 They must have been considerate because he was a child actor.\u201cEveryone is so quiet\u201d.\u201cI hope it\u2019s always like today.\u201dBrown Black, would usually be a mess when they left for the airport. The bodyguards were all nervous after experiencing such a situation. Now they were puzzled, but still did their best.One reporter asked Seojun a question as a representative.The questions for an 8-year-old child actor who has no scandal and no problem are all similar questions, so everyone took out their laptops without much competition.\u201cCan you tell us how you feel about being nominated for a film festival?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unexpected. My heart is still racing frok excitement. Thank you to everyone who voted! Even if I don\u2019t get it this time, I\u2019ll do my best to get it next time!\u201dSeojun clenched his small fist and answered with a bright look.They could heard a roar here and there, but soon they shut their mouths as if embarrassed by the appearance of people who did not respond much.Only the sound of applause rang the airport.Some reporters, wondered why there was such a quiet response. They turned their heads and swallowed their saliva after seeing the fans.It\u2019s not good\u2026 It\u2019s not.His fans\u2019 had all sparkling eyes and their palms are clapping to the point where it hurts.Several questions followed.Click click. In the quiet middle, only the shutter sound resonated.The bodyguards and An Daho breathed a sigh of relief at the safer atmosphere than expected. They admired the fans\u2019 self-control for Seojun. There are fans like this too!It was time to head to the departure hall. Seojun couldn\u2019t take his eyes off towards his fans and waved his hands.Seojun\u2019s relationship with fans gradually grew apart.As the source of the scent gradually moved away, the suppressed voices of fans came out from here and there.\u201cSeojun! Make sure to win an award!\u201d\u201cI even ask my whole family to vote for you!\u201dStill, thanks to the scent of flowers floating in the air, the quiet atmosphere did not break. Seojun, who noticed the hearts of fans through their sparkling eyes even if they did not express it with cheers, smiled.\u201cThank you! I\u2019ll be back safely!\u201dFans covered their mouths, impressed by Seojun waving his hands until the moment he disappeared beyond the departure hall. It was so cute![Lee Seojun left for the U.S. to attend the WTV Film Festival!][Just like today, the fans were calm!][MONSTER\u2019s products are always there!][Lee Seojun\u2019s airport fashion! What\u2019s the price?]Lee Seojun\u2019s departure also became a hot topic, but Lee Seojun\u2019s fans\u2019 attitude was the number one hot topic to the extent that it was comparable to him.Everyone applauded Seojun\u2019s love even in silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t take pain killers because I was afraid that there would be some reaction, so for the whole day yesterday I just slept and didn\u2019t translate anything.***[Title: It was amazing todayI went on a trip in another country and just came back to Korea today. Because my time returning to Korea coincided with Seojun flight schedule to America, I went to see Lee Seojun for a bit together with the crowd.I often use the airport for work and I usually see celebrities leave the country or enter the the country, but in all the time peace wasn\u2019t present.Managers and bodyguards would usually be hit by the cell phone and camera of fans. So I didn\u2019t go close, but I was just watching far behind.\u2026.Contrary to my expectations, the whole area was calm.I think the number of the fans gathered is similar to famous idols, but it was really peaceful. Even though there are times we could hear loud noises, it soon becomes quiet yet again.All I could hear was reporters\u2019 questions, camera\u2019s click sound, and Lee Seojun\u2019s voice.The only response from his fans are applause. The response that they did throughout Seojun appearance was only applause! When I look at the fans\u2019 expression,they looked really moved and didn\u2019t dare to get close to their idols.]-That scene was really incredible.-Maybe because the actor is young. Most of the fans from the fan cafe also said so.-There were no post in which the fans organizes their formation. I think they did it purely by instinct.Before the plane departed, Seojun was looking through Internet articles. Then, he left a message in the fan cafe.Seojun posted that he would be having a safe trip, fans cried and left many comments saying, \u201cEven if you didn\u2019t win we would still be supporting you, so take care of yourself and have a safe trip!\u201dAs they were waiting at the airport entrance after taking their luggage, a large car stood in front of the group of Seojun.The driver\u2019s window went down and there was a blonde woman.\u201cHi! Rachel!\u201d\u201cJun! Long time no see!\u201dRachel Hill welcomed Seojun\u2019s party, who had just arrived in the U.S.Rachel Hill took her head out of the window and talked to Seojun briefly, and a loud voice was heard from somewhere among the crowd.\u2018Didn\u2019t someone say Rachel?\u2019At that, Rachel, wearing sunglasses, briefly \u2018tsk\u2019 her tongue and beckoned.\u201cHurry up and get on! It will be hard to get out if we get caught!\u201dWithout time to say their greetings, Seojun and his parents, Seo Eun-chan and An Daho all got into Rachel Hill\u2019s car.After confirming that everyone was in the car, Rachel Hill started the engine and left the airport.\u201cThank you. I owe you this much.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dSeo Eun-Hye was the one who phoned Rachel Hill that they will be arriving in America today.Seojun and his parents will be attending the film festival for the first time in their lives. They did not know much about the film festival and the guide from the film festival was also not very helpful.Fortunately, there were many people around Seojun who knew well about what would happen at the film festival.When they contacted Ryan Will, Rachel Hill, and Evan Block, they decided that Seojun would be together with the two on the Red carpet.This year\u2019s WTV Film Festival was scheduled to be held in Los Angeles.The city of the film industry, LA, where Hollywood is located, had many directors, actors, and people with film-related jobs.Rachel Hill was also one of the people who own a large mansion in LA.Seojun nodded when Rachel Hill said, \u201cSince this happened, why don\u2019t you stay at my house and go to the film festival together?\u201d\u201cThis is my house.\u201dSeojun, his parents, Seo Eun-chan and An Daho were speechless seeing the large mansion with a garden.As expected, the size of the houses in America were different from that of Korea. America has a vast land compared to Korea.(TL: South Korea is just half of one state of America or even smaller.)Everyone got out of the car and unpacked their things on the room that Rachel Hill guided them to.\u201cLet me know if you need anything.\u201dEveryone smiled awkwardly and nodded at Rachel Hill\u2019s words.She also introduced them to her employees as important guest.Well, it would have been difficult to manage such a large house without people.***The next day.After adjusting to the time difference, Seojun went to the dining room together with all the adults.Rachel Hill, who had prepared breakfast in advance, welcomed the five people.Everyone settled down and filled their stomachs.While having a light conversation from time to time, the topic of the film festival was discussed.\u201cWe need to choose clothes first.\u201dRachel Hill, who was drinking warm tea, opened her mouth. Seo Eun-Hye tilted her head.\u201cIf it\u2019s a suit, do you think it\u2019s not good because we brought it from Korea?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay, but there might be something better. Wait. I have something prepared in the living room.\u201dRachel Hill guided Seojun and the adults to the living room.In the spacious living room with a soft sofa, there were many clothes rack full of children suits and employees next to it.\u201cWhat\u2019s that Rachel?\u201dAt Seojun\u2019s question, Rachel Hill smiled and said.\u201cThey are Jun\u2019s clothes.\u201d\u201cMy clothes?\u201d\u201cYes. This are all the clothes given to me in order to pass it to you once you arrive here in America. Everyone asked me that you should wear this at the film festival or other events.\u201d\u2018All of this?\u2019All the others were speechless.Rachel Hill took out the clothes that were hung in front of her and showed them.As if she were a show host, she introduced clothes by explaining the brand, designer, and characteristics of clothes.There were various kinds of clothes, from famous brands that adults have heard of several times to brands that have just begun to rise recently.\u201cThis is the clothes from a place that has been popular for children\u2019s clothing these days. It\u2019s less famous because it\u2019s a children\u2019s clothing brand, but it\u2019s a place where people know what clothes fit any child well. With this clothes it is easy to move even when worn by active children.\u201d\u201cThis place is famous for women\u2019s suits, and I heard that they are creating a new brand for children\u2019s suits. If Jun wears it, he will probably be their first model.\u201dThere were more than ten clothes that explained in the same way.\u201cThey need to adjust it to fit Jun\u2019s body. The designers said they would come if there was a need. Oh, you don\u2019t have to feel pressured. During the film festival, each brand will send many stylist to adjust in the clothes well. We don\u2019t know when or where the clothes will need a fix.\u201dWhat Rachel Hill\u2019s explained did not fall into the clothes that were for \u201cSeojun.\u201d Suits are rarely adjusted while dress they need to be in constant care especially in important events.Many designers who said they were inspired by William they felt like they were struck by lightning when they saw Jin Natra\u2019s acting and many inspiration came into their mind.Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon heard explanations from Rachel Hill. They were proud of their son.\u201cTheir are a lot better than the clothes you brought from Korea!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s dress him up first.\u201dThe couple and Rachel Hill\u2019s eyes sparkled. Seo Eun-Chan and An Daho, who saw them, shook their heads.Seojun, who did not expect this kind of future, bit the delicious chocolate cookie.Seojun\u2019s small fashion show began.***When Seo Eun-Chan and An Daho finished choosing the next clothes, Lee Min-joon diligently started to shoot with his camera.While, Seo Eun-Hye and Rachel Hill were busy being the judge of Seojun\u2019s small fashion show.\u201cIt\u2019s better to put his hair back, right?\u201d\u201cOr it\u2019d be okay if we moved it to the side a little bit.\u201dAt first, Seojun was happily posing as if he had become a real fashion model, but now all he could do was to sigh and taking off his clothes.Seo Eun-chan and An Daho smiled awkwardly and handed over the next clothes.\u201cNow you only need to change three times.\u201d\u201cCheer up, Seojun.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u2018Okay. Let\u2019s do it 3 more times!\u2019But before he could start, someone rang the doorbell. It was Evan Block, who came to Rachel Hill\u2019s house with many paper bags on both of hands at the news that Seojun has already arrive.\u201cOh, that\u2019s great. I brought mine too.\u201dEvan Block took out all the clothes he brought. They were all children\u2019s clothes, clearly they were for Seojun.\u201cMany brands asked me to deliver it to Jun.\u201dThose who contacted Rachel Hill were from women\u2019s clothing brands, while Evan Block were men\u2019s clothing brands.They have no way to reach Seojun, so it seemed they have sent the clothes through the two actors.\u2018But I\u2019m glad that there are only six this times.\u2019Seojun looked at the new clothes with tired eyes.\u201cThen let\u2019s do this.\u201dAfter wearing and taking off a total of 20 clothes, time flew by.With Evan Block joining in, Seojun\u2019s clothes and hairstyle is now finally decided.Everyone gathered and had dinner, and Seo Eun-chan and An Daho headed to their room. This was because there was still work left on Seojun\u2019s schedule after the film festival.Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon decided to go see their acquaintances in LA after a long time.They were worried about Seojun, but they were at peace because the actors had something to talk about to each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is more fun.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re probably the only one like that. What about Jun?\u201cI love it!\u201dTheir time to choose a movie was taking longer, perhaps because it was more fun to choose DVD.\u2018How long are they going to choose?\u2019Rachel Hill, who was waiting bored, suddenly remembered something.\u201cLet\u2019s watch that\u201d.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe play.\u201dAt the words of Rachel Hill, Evan Block and Seojun turned their heads toward her.Rachel Hill remembered what she heard from Nara Kim.\u201cI don\u2019t know if there are English subtitles, Jun. I heard you were in a play.\u201dEvan Block finally remembered.He forgot for a moment because he was so into choosing DVD.Seojun, who made his debut with a movie, took the stage.According to the Nara\u2019s explanation, only the children were on stage.It was natural for the two Hollywood actors to look disappointed, but it was Seojun\u2019s acting after all.Seojun\u2019s acting that makes the story cool.Rather, it was regrettable that they couldn\u2019t watch it in person. If they had known, they would have flown to Korea right away.Fortunately, Seojun\u2019s play was available to be purchased.\u201cYes, we should watch it!\u201d\u201cIs there a DVD for that?\u201d\u201cYes! I brought it. There are English subtitles too!\u201dSeojun jumped up and headed to his room.Rachel and Evan followed.Two DVDs came out of Seojun\u2019s wolf-shaped bag.The two burst into laughter at the DVD with a cute cover handed over by Seojun.\u201cThen, let\u2019s watch this.\u201d\u201cOnly child actors appear in this. And we constantly changed our lines\u2026\u201dSeojun explained the play as they headed to the movie theater.The two were nodding their heads and listening to his story. They were now more curious about Seojun\u2019s acting.\u201cI\u2019m really curious.\u201d\u201cI know. I can\u2019t guess what kind of acting he did.\u201dSeojun and other two actors sat down. The stage unfolded on a large screen in front of the three actors.The 1st Episode.The 2nd Episode.The 3rd Episode.Evan Block and Rachel Hill were enjoying the play, but soon watched at the play seriously. The two actors only looked at the screen without blinking.Seojun already watched the play for several times already. He blinked his heavy eyelids several times before he fell asleep on the soft sofa.In the meantime, the couple, who returned from their outing, saw the two actors watching the play in the movie theater and Seojun who fell asleep.Even if the door opened, the two actors did not notice. So Lee Min-joon quietly hugged Seojun and Seo Eun-Hye closed the movie theater door tightly.And finally, the 8th episode.Evan Block and Rachel Hill couldn\u2019t take their eyes off the screen for a moment.In Korea, the \u201cReal blue dragon,\u201d which some of the audience defined it as it is, is now in front of the two.Wavy beard, sharp eyes, sparkling toenails, with a kind voice and warm eyes.It was a strange idea, but somehow the two thought there seemed to be a blue dragon standing.* * *Rachel Hill\u2019s mansion has been noisy since morning. Everyone needed to hurry and to go to the WTV Film Festival.The makeup artist hired by Rachel Hill were busy putting makeup on Seojun. Evan Block headed to Rachel Hill.Seojun got into the car dressed in a black suit that had been repaired according to Seojun\u2019s body shape. He was wearing a bow tie with his bangs pulled back.\u201cSeojun, you have to pack this.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeo Eun-Hye folded a handkerchief and put it into Seojun\u2019s suit pocket. A black suit and a white handkerchief stood out.It was a handkerchief embroidered with Pegasus. This was given by Seo Eun-chan to commemorate being nominated for the film festival.Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon fixed Seojun\u2019s hair and suit, smiled and said.\u201cMom and dad will be watching you! Do your best!\u201d\u201cSeojun, fighting!\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ll do my best!\u201dSeojun hugged his mom and dad. He could hear the hearts of his mom and dad beating with tension.Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon waved at Seojun while they got into another car.Seojun watched his mother and father\u2019s car depart through the window. His mom and dad decided to watch from the stands of the film festival with Uncle Chan and Da-ho.\u201cI wish we could go together\u2026\u201dIt was regrettable, but it was better to go separately then having his mom and dad mobbed by people screaming around with repeated camera flashes.\u201cYou did a great job in the play.\u201dEvan Block, sitting next to Seojun said.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah. I couldn\u2019t sleep because I watched them all night. You may not see it now because it\u2019s covered with makeup, but my dark circles came down this much.\u201dWhen Evan pointed his finger at the tip of his chin, Seojun burst into laughter.\u201cWhat? Are you enjoying your chatter without me?\u201dAnd finally Rachel Hill got into the car. Rachel Hill wore a bright red dress and her blonde hair was neatly styled into a bun. She was really pretty.\u201cYou are very pretty, Rachel!\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dRachel Hill sat down at the side of Seojun.\u201cWhat were you talking about?\u201d\u201cAbout the play. Evan watched it all night.\u201d\u201cAh. I watched it with him. I lost track of time while watching it. I\u2019m really tired right now, so I might sleep at the awards ceremony later on.\u201dEveryone burst into laughter at Rachel Hill\u2019s words. Rachel Hill smiled and continued.\u201cLet\u2019s give the DVD director Ryan later too.\u201d\u201cHe may leave in the middle of the Awards Ceremony, si we should give it to him at the end.\u201dSeojun nodded at Evan\u2019s words, he thought the director would really leave in the middle of the film festival in order to watch it.While the three actors were talking to each other, the car started.In the middle of their trip, Ryan Will, who will walk on the red carpet together with them, got also in the car and all the Shadowman teams gathered.While talking about one thing or another, the story of DVD came out somehow.When Seojun said he left his DVD at Rachel Hill\u2019s house to attend the film festival, director Ryan Will shook his leg as if he was excited throughout the whole trip.Seojun met with Evan\u2019s eyes and laughed.There was a loud noise and the car stopped.[Title: WTV Film Festival.It was just the beginning.It\u2019s today, right?]-We have to get the award!-What time does it start? The time in Korea is different.There was a post on Seojun\u2019s fan cafe. Everyone waited for the festival to start with half anticipation, half tension, and half nervousness.It wasn\u2019t just from Seojun\u2019s fan cafe.Those who watched Seojun\u2019s movies and those who did not watched waited for the news, wondering if the small child would be able to receive the award.\u2013 You can watch it here. [Link]\u2013 Thank you!-Oh, it\u2019s Director Ryan!The Internet became noisy at the news that Ryan Will got out of the car. In other words, if he appeared as the Shadowman\u2019s director, Lee Seojun would also soon come out.* * *Director Ryan Will got out of the big car. Camera Flashes went on.Evan Block was wearing a gray suit and Rachel Hill a red dress. The two also came down. Finally, Seojun in a black suit with his bangs neatly pulled back appeared.With the appearance of the Shadowman team,\u201cKyaaah!\u201dThey could hear screams from all over the place.\u201cShadowman!\u201d\u201cRachel!\u201d\u201cJin!\u201d\u201cEvan!\u201d\u201cJun!\u201d\u201cBell!\u201d\u201cNatra!\u201dWalking in the middle of bodyguards, Seojun listened to the cheers of the people.Every step he took, he heard cheers everywhere.It was like walking on cloud nine. MAlthough he was calming his heart throughout the time he was in the car, his heartbeat was more active now when standing on the red carpet.\u201cThere are a lot of bodyguards and fences here, so I don\u2019t need to use my skills, right?\u201d\u2019\u201cHe is a Superstar!\u201dPeople shouted at Seojun\u2019s sparkling appearance and aura.The flash of the camera exploded.The disturbance, which is at a different level than before, attracted the attention of those who were ahead.The disturbance of the gathered people greatly inconveniences the others. If Seo Eun-chan had seen it, he would have just said this was crowd sentiment.To respond at their enthusiasm, Seojun stayed back and greeted each of them.It was Ryan Will who stopped the wild people and Seojun.\u201cJun. Calm down.\u201dRyan Will tapped Seojun\u2019s shoulder, who was waving hard at every fan.Oh, it seemed he have enjoyed it too much. Seojun breathed out and touch his wrist.[Apple flower scent that calms you down]Upon smelling the sweet fragrance, the people began to calm down one by one. Everyone stepped back from the fence and showed a proper response again.Seojun looked at the apple flower pattern engraved on his wrist. He thought it was a useless ability, but it was the most useful right now.\u201cDid you have fun?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Theh didn\u2019t notice it because they were enjoying themselves, but\u00a0 they already at the interview zone.More cameras and reporters were waiting for the Shadowman team than ever.Rachel Hill, who has the best sense of humor and is familiar with interviews among the flashy camera flashes, led the interview.While passing on questions that were difficult to answer and talking to the reporters, what drew attention of the reporters during their interview with Evan, Seojun, and Ryan was the ending.\u201cPlease look forward to Shadowman 3!\u201dThey even finished promoting Shadowman 3, which they had not even started filminh yet.The men were mesmerized at Rachel Hill without realizing it.\u201cRachel, your interview was really cool.\u201d\u201cReally? You\u2019ll get better once you are comfortable talking with them.\u201dThe four entered the awards hall and sat at a table with \u2018Shadowman\u2019 written and took a breather.After drinking a sip of water handed over by Evan, Seojun looked at the audience and found his mother, father, uncle, and Daho.Since Seojun came in, the four\u2019s eyes stucked at him, perhaps because they only came to looked at Seojun.\u201cHey, Seojun!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dWhen Seojun looked back and waved, Evan Block and Rachel Hill also looked there. The two actors also found Seojun\u2019s family.Seo Eun-Hye, Lee Min-joon, Seo Eun-chan, and An Daho all waved back.\u201cHow did you find them when there were so many people?\u201d\u201cInstinct?\u201dSeojun ability to find the four people in this wide audience was great.After a short greeting, everyone waited for the film festival to start.Director Ryan Will asked the Korean interpreter of Seojun to read the reviews on internet about \u2018Spring\u2019, while the three actors talked about the starring actors of the movies and dramas entering.The people sitting next to him, the people sitting behind him, and the people sitting in front of him were all actors that Seojun could only watch on screen.Rachel Hill and Evan Block introduced Seojun at every acquaintance they meet.As they were waiting like that, the MC started talking and the WTV Film Festival\u2019s Award Ceremony finally began.The film festival began with a performance by a solo artist who was always ranked at the top of the Billboard chart whenever he released an album.Seojun clapped enthusiastically as he watched the performance.The singer possessed different charms then from the actors.After the spectacular performances, the MC grabbed the microphone.He briefly introduced and talk about the WTV Film Festival.

I never thought I\u2019d get an award like this until I filmed Shadowman 1. Unlike Redborn, which is a famous for comic, I\u2019m so happy that the Shadowman of 20 years ago won this award. Please continue to show your love to us.\u2026.\u201dEvan Block and Seojun\u2019s eyes met. The corners of Evan Block\u2019s mouth went up slightly.\u201cPlease look forward to Shadowman 3.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dA loud applause rang in the whole awards ceremony hall.Evan Block came down from the stage with the trophy.\u201cCongratulations!

Well, he is an actor worth it. Did he got nominated in the wrong award? This actor is already drawing enough attention. People around the world were impressed with this actor\u2019s acting. And I\u2019m looking forward to his next film! The winner of Noteworthy Actor Award is\u2026\u2026.\u201dOn a quiet stage, the MC shouted loudly.Cameras that used to illuminate several candidates particularly shone on Ryan Will, Rachel Hill, Evan Block, and Seojun for a long time.In the audience, Seo Eun-Hye, Lee Min-joon, Seo Eun-chan, and An Daho held each other\u2019s hand while preying it was Seojun\u2019s.Pit-a-pat.Pit-a-pat.\u201cSeojun Lee, who played Jin Natra in Shadowman 2!\u201dA loud shout was heard, and Seo Eun-hye and Lee Min-joon were so surprised that they couldn\u2019t even processed what was happening.Deep inside they already expected it but they can\u2019t believe the got it. Tears fell from their eyes out of emotion.Seo Eun-Chan called for hurrah, and An Daho leaned against the back of the chair as if he had lost energy.A large camera headed for Seojun. On the screen, they saw a child staring blankly at the MC. They all applauded with cheers and congratulations.Evan Block tapped Seoju on the shoulder. Richell Hill, and Director Ryan Will clapped at him.Seojun was surprised and speechless. He felt like he was going to lose his breath at any moment.\u201cCome on up, Jun!\u201dHis heart pounded at the MC\u2019s voice.\u2018Prize, I got an award.I won an award for my acting and movie.\u2019The library of life shook.Emotions overflowed and he started crying. Tears flowed from Seojun\u2019s eyes.\u2018I got an award for acting.\u2019That\u2019s all he could think of.His first life swallowed Seojun like a wave.A lot of emotions flocked toward Seojun.Happiness. Happiness.Satisfaction.Seojun, who was about to sink into the sea, stopped.Satisfied?Here?Only here?Seojun tilted his head and removed the emotion of his first life that was affecting him.You\u2019re satisfied with this?You don\u2019t have the guts?You don\u2019tHis life in his first life faltered.I\u2019ve told you.Seojun smiled.I\u2019m going to be a superstar!A superstar can\u2019t be satisfied with just one award!Seojun, who fell deep in his emotion without realizing it, returned to reality. Only less than a second has passed.Director Ryan pushed his back.Seojun went up to the stage.The stage was wide. Only Seojun and the MC stood on a wide stage.All the audiences who attended the film festival, and all the viewers who were watching on the air, were only looking at Seojun.Standing next to the Big MC, Seojun looked even smaller. The audience applauded for celebration.The trophy handed over by the MC shone. His first trophy. The shiny award was a bit funny.It was a trophy with gold popcorn in a red popcorn box.When Evan Block was holding it, it looked funny because of the contrasting difference, but it looked really good on the young Seojun. Everyone thought so and applauded.It was a funny-looking trophy, but it was still an award. Seojun smiled and held the trophy.Perhaps because he lived a life of only being an extra, he became too greedy in his first life. His first life was an opportunity, but this was his current life. It was Lee Seojun\u2019s life.You can\u2019t be satisfied with one Award!Seojun\u2019s face was zoomed in on the screen standing behind Seo-jun.Lee Seojun, neither William nor Jin Natra, was reflected on the screen. Viewers around the world were surprised to see the Shadowman series with that young face.Seojun looked at the camera lens that was filming him. The dark black eyes penetrated the camera and looked at everyone.Everyone unknowingly held their breath and looked at Seojun on the screen.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Lee Seojun.\u201dSeojun\u2019s speech began with a Korean greeting.After that, it was English.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you, everyone!\u201dHe heard a whistle. It was Jonathan Will, was sitting in the middle the audience. Jonathan didn\u2019t expect his name to be called out. Some of the Shadowman\u2019s staff sitting around Jonathan also cheered.\u201cAnd all the people around the world who voted for me. Korean fans! Thank you so much, everyone!\u201dApplause erupted from the whole audience. Seojun, who was trying to go down with the trophy, stopped because he forgot something. He went back to the MC and got a microphone.While everyone was wondering, Seojun smiled and said.\u201cPlease look forward to Shadowman 3!\u201d(Laughs)[Actor Lee Seojun won the \u201cNoteworthy Actor Award\u201d][The youngest actor to win an WTV award!][Actor Lee Seojun\u2019s cute acceptance speech that everyone fell in love with!][The little kid grew up like this!]-I cried when he begun speaking in Korean-I\u2019m so proud of you!

The venue was a hotel near the awards ceremony.Since it was a surprise party to celebrate Seojun\u2019s first award, the couple and the Shadowman team invited only a few acquaintances.Rachel and Evan set off confetti when they saw Seojun appear at the party in comfortable clothes after changing his suits.\u201cCongratulations on winning the award!\u201dThe people who arrived first also congratulated Seojun by exploding the confetti they were holding.The acquaintances invited by Seo Eun-Hye and Lee Min-joon, and Seo Eun-chan and An Daho also set off their confetti. He was surprised, but Seojun, who was so happy, that he just smiled.\u201cThank you!\u201dJack, together with the Smith couple were the only ordinary people. They looked around at the people present with surprised faces.There was also a well-known actor and director of their favorite movie.It felt even more amazing because they were not overly dressed, they were wearing clothes as if they were attending a neighbor\u2019s home party.\u201cCongratulations on winning the award!\u201d\u201cThank you, Jack.\u201dSeojun gave Jack chocolate cookies. Jack couldn\u2019t eat snacks today, so he quickly put a large cookie in his mouth when he saw his mom and dad talking to Seojun\u2019s parents.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it really good?\u201dJack said with a surprised face because it was the first time he had such a delicious cookie.Seojun, who managed to understand him, smiled and gave him warm milk.Jack\u2019s expression loosened. Chocolate cookies soaked gently in milk were very delicious.\u201cThis is really good!\u201d\u201cDo you want to take it and it later on?\u201d\u201cCan I take it?\u201d\u201cYes! There are so many!\u201dSeojun and Jack were the only two children invited to the party, but there were so many cookies and cakes that suited the children\u2019s taste.Seojun and Jack tasted all the food little by little with a very expectant face.They went this way and that way. The busy children were caught by the eyes of the adults who were talking.The directors looked at their childlike appearance and burst into laughter. Director Ryan Will opened his mouth.\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine. He look like a normal kid. How can he act like that?\u201d\u201cI know. William\u2019s acting was amazing, but Shadowman 2 was also impressive.\u201dSarah Lot, the Director of Green Wing, who went against Shadowman 1, nodded.Ryan Will,m covered the corners of his mouth with a wine glass and called Seojun.At Ryan Will\u2019s call, Seojun turned towards Jack. When Seojun asked if he would like to go with him, Jack shook his head because there were a lot of adults he didn\u2019t know.Seojun ran to Ryan Will while skipping.\u201cDirector, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI want to introduce you to other directors. This is Sarah Lot, who Directed the green wing.\u201dSeojun\u2019s eyes got bigger.Sarah Lot, the director of Green Wing, who showed a great sense of directing, reached out her hands.Seojun grabbed Sarah Lot\u2019s hand tightly and shook it.\u201cNice to meet you!

Directors fell in love with Seojun\u2019s chatter nodded one after another.As the talk grew longer, Seojun saw Jack alone and bored.Seojun had fun talking to the directors, but he had no choice but to pay attention to his friend Jack.Recognizing the fact, Ryan Will restrained other Director and sent Seojun away.Since then, directors have not been able to take their eyes off from the young genius.George Roberts, the director of Assemble, has been with many experienced actors.\u201cImmersed acting at that age? It doesn\u2019t have any aftereffects? He must have been blessed with talent from heaven. I have never seen that much talent to an actor ever before.\u201d\u201cI know. He\u2019s an actor on which I look forward to his future.\u201d\u201cFuture? Why the future?

If there were three more children at this party, there would have been a huge fuss.David, who saw the children hesitating at an unexpected meeting, took out a pen familiarly.\u201cDo you want my autograph?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dJack quickly ran towardsMaria, who made eye contact with David Garrett, slapped her forehead while looking at the place where her son ran from. She quickly took out her notebook and handed it over to her son.\u201cJack, son.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cPlease ask another for your mom\u2019s too!\u201dJack nodded at the words of Maria, a big fan of David Garrett.Jack, who had received a bunch of paper, also handed one out to Seojun.Davis Garrett familiarly signed the paper.

Davis signed with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that we couldn\u2019t act together in the same movie, Jin Natra and Redborn together.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s act in the same movie next time!\u201d\u201cI heard from Evan that you previously acted in a play.\u201d\u201cCan I join?\u201dSeojun, who was trying to nod at Davis\u2019 question, turned his head to a familiar but unfamiliar voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was Swarlin An, who became Seojun\u2019s teacher through his videos.\u201cSwarlin, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cYeah. You\u2019ve improved a lot, too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still a long way from yours.\u201dRachel, Evan, and David, who had a movie together with Swarlin An before, are having a conversation, but Seojun just stared at Swarlin An blankly.\u201cSigh, you have to get an autograph!\u201d\u2019\u201cPlease give me your autograph.\u201dSeojun shouted with a more excited face than when he asked David Garrett.David Garrett clearly knew whose fan Seojun was just by seeing his expression. He raised his hands and pretended to lose. Evan and Rachel burst into laughter at the appearance of the little boy.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cI also want to act with you in the future!\u201dSwarlin An, who went to borrow David\u2019s pen at Seojun\u2019s words, tilted his head and made eye contact with Ryan Will. He smiled at Ryan Will, who zipped his mouth.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s act together.\u201d\u201cYehey!\u201dDirector Ryan Will, who was watching Seojun and the actors having a pleasant conversation, turned towards the directors again. It was because an interesting story caught his ears.\u201cGreen Wing 2 will be released next year, right?\u201d\u201cI may have lost the match, but there are still many fans waiting for the second movie of green wing.\u201d\u201cGood. Green Wing 1 was good too. Especially the music and battle scenes. You must have had a hard time matching the music and the video.\u201dSarah Lot laughed at the other\u00a0 Directors\u2019 compliments.\u201cWhen I make a movie, I mostly pay attention to music. So, why don\u2019t I make a musical movie with music as the main subject? I have been thinking about this for a long time. I really want to make a musical movie next time.\u201d\u201cIf it is a musical movie directed by Sarah Lot. Have you thought about who would be the main character?\u201dSarah Lot\u2019s eyes turned towards one place when she was asked such question. The eyes of the other directors, also headed there.Seojun and the other four actors were talking to each other.Seeing how well they integrate with each other, the topic was most likely about acting.There were four adult actors who will guarantee its success, but the directors there already knew that they were not the actors that Sarah Lot would want for a musical movie.Seojun Lee, a child actor with sparkling eyes was using all kinds of gestures to talk passionately to the other parties.\u201cOh!\u201dSomeone uttered a low exclamation. Ryan Will, immediately know who she wanted for the movie.\u2018A Musical movies and Jun. I don\u2019t need to worry that he wouldn\u2019t fit in that genre. Isn\u2019t he an actor that can play any role?\u2019He was already looking forward on how great the movie would become.A thriller director, also a former musician, asked half desperately.\u201cCan you tell us the rough storyline? I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d\u201cI still have a lot to prepare. The synopsis isn\u2019t done yet either.\u201dWhen the directors were about to burst into laughter at Sarah Lot\u2019s waved her hand,\u201cThat movie. Can we invest in it?\u201dA person sitting near the Director\u2019s group opened his mouth.The directors\u2019 eyes all look on the man asking the question. In addition to the man, also several others were watching the directors.Director Ryan Will frowned and looked around the crowded venue of the party.This was not the only place that held a party after the film festival.However, many actors and directors wanted to see the child actor who showed tremendous acting skills.For that reason alone, actors with fans around the world and directors with guaranteed box office success, mostly attended Seojun\u2019s party.Delicious prey were gathered in one place. All the reporters, investors, and filmmakers had no choice but to pay attention to this one and only place.When a person came to know where they were heading, words of mouth begin to spread immediately and soon the size of the party has grown.The directors also noticed that fact.Sarah lot scratched her temple.If the the party was like this, the social media should be a mess right now.The directors were not the only ones who noticed what was happening. The party\u2019s organizers, Rachel Hill and Evan Block, sent Seojun\u2019s acquaintances, who are ordinary people not part of entertainment world, to the back door of the hotel. Everyone left the party after promising to meet each other later.Seojun said his goodbyes to his acquaintances leaving with their cars.He didn\u2019t notice it because he was inside a bright hotel function hall, but it was already night.Lee Min-joon looked at the clock, he didn\u2019t that many hours had already pass because his son was so excited to have won the award.\u201cI think it\u2019s too late. Shall we go back now?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s already past Seojun\u2019s bedtime. Seojun, aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay, but I\u2019ll go back since it\u2019s already late!\u201dThere\u2019s no Jack, and there are many people he didn\u2019t know at the party. Actors and directors can talk to each other all night, but he wasn\u2019t accustomed to that kind of atmosphere.\u2018Oh! I forgot!\u2019\u201cI need to ask for Swarlin and David\u2019s phone numbers\u201d.They became very close in the short conversation, but he still didn\u2019t know their phone number yet.\u2018I have to get their phone numbers!\u2019Seojun\u2019s eyes shined.* * *[Stars\u2019 celebration party at the Royal Steaver Hotel!][Hollywood\u2019s stars are gathered together!][Another film festival?

Please!\u201dSeo Eun-chan made a wish and prayed again and again. The airport guards and bodyguards, who went through the departure route with Seojun, also prayed deep inside.\u2018Just be as peaceful as then.\u2019Seojun\u2019s arrival day.Seeing people flocking to the airport, Seo Eun-chan unknowingly looked up in the sky and prayed.Cocoa Entertainment employee who came to the airport also called for God or Blue Dragon.\u201cAre they people waiting for Seojun?\u201d\u201cI wish they were actually people leaving the country!\u201dTheir prayers didn\u2019t seem to work. The plane had not arrived yet, but it was already crowded.Exceptionally large cameras were being installed and near the arrival.Seo Eun-chan opened his mouth as he was reading the names of the broadcasting stations written on each cameras.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, that one.\u201dTeam leader Kim Soo-Ryeon, who understood Seo Eun-chan\u2019s thoughts at once, nodded.\u201c\u2026Would it have been better not to say yes to the live broadcast?\u201d\u201cI think they would still come here.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Seo Eun-chan, who agreed with team leader Kim Soo-Ryeon, muttered while washing his face dry.\u201cWhy are there so many?\u201d\u201cSeojun is 8 years old now, right? This much of people waiting for him is expected. They are all curious what kind of movies will he shoot and how successful will it be? What about when he will become 10 or 13 years old? As he get older, he\u2019ll become more famous. It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d Team leader Kim Soo-Ryeon says recalling posts posted on Seojun\u2019s fan cafe.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that growth. 48 hours, CF commercial, William, The Devil, Jin natra. Maybe everyone in the world is watching the growth of an actor who is writing an historical. Like a legendary singer, the growth of a superstar who will still be famous even 100 years later.\u201dIt was the hearts of the people gathered here and the people watching live on television.\u201cAn actor\u2019s childhood was this now, so who wouldn\u2019t be curious about his future?\u201dAt the words of team leader Kim Soo-ryeon, Seo Eun-chan looked at the crowded airport.
