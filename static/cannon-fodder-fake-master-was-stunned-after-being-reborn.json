What are you fucking doing inside!!! I know you're inside!\"\"Oye Jian Xingsuuuuiiiii!!!!\"When Jian Xingsui opened his eyes, he only felt dizzy. His memory was still stuck in the pain of his death in his previous life. It was only after his death that he unexpectedly learned that he was in a book involving the plot of a real and fake young master from a wealthy family. Of course, he was the fake young master who had his filthy eyes on the wealth of the Jian family. So at last, he finally became the villain who finally received the karma of his ''good'' deeds and left this cruel world.\"Dong dong dong!\"There were still knocks on the door outside: \"Jian Xingsui, what are you pretending to be dead inside for???? Come out and make it clear. If you don't open the door, I will kick the door.\"Jian Xingsui originally had a headache and didn't want to move, but after hearing the persistent knock on the door outside, he had to sit up and open the door with difficulty. He was very worried that if he didn't open the door, the other party would do more crazy things.\"Click\"The door opened.Standing outside, Jian Kuo frowned fiercely, watching his son finally open the door. He was about to scold when he saw Jian Xingsui's pale face, bloodless, and for some unknown reason, his body was as fragile as it would fall down at any time.If it were before, he might have been concerned and distressed, but now, he just frowned more severely: \"What trick are you trying to use this time?\"......Jian Xingsui looked at the stranger in front of him, and for a moment, his whole spirit seemed to have been dumbfounded.This person in front of him was his father. No, to be precise, his former father. Before An Ran appeared, his father still loved him a little bit. But after the protagonist appeared, everyone seemed to have lost their minds and their temperaments changed greatly. Everyone hated him and everyone desperately wanted him to disappear.\"Why don't you talk?\" Jian Kuo stepped in as if he was finally acting on the behalf of heavens to spread justice all over the world: \"Let me tell you fucker!!! You actually did such a crazy thing yesterday and dared to trouble An Ran.\u00a0If I hadn't gone early, such a kind child An Ran might have been bullied by you. I have raised you for so many years, but I didn't expect you to be so arrogant and domineering, which is really disappointing! \"While speaking, he observed Jian Xingsui's expression.When he found that Jian Xingsui was still staring at him in a daze, he acted even more severely: \"It seems that you still don't understand where you are wrong, so let me make it clearer to you!!! No matter what fucking stupid tricks you use today, you must get the fuck out of this house!\"......After speaking, Jian Kuo wanted to wait and see what kind of cheap trick Jian Xingsui would use this time, but what he didn't expect was that there was dead silence in the room.Then,Jian Xingsui looked at him uncertainly and said, \"Yesterday?\"Jian Kuo was stunned for a moment. He didn't know which movie's dialogue would this damn child recite to him again. So he said impatiently, \"If not yesterday then when? You fucking idiot! Why? Do you still want to deny it and say you didn't do it?\"Jian Xingsui leaned weakly against the back door: \"Do you mean to say, I'm 19 years old now?\"Jian Kuo heard his nonsense and couldn't help but feel even more disgusted: \"OHHO? Now you are even asking this kind of question??\"Jian Xingsui didn't answer. He just touched his head and laughed lowly.At first, he couldn't believe it, but now he has to believe that he was actually reborn.\u00a0Moreover, he was reborn at the time when the protagonist shou An Ran was on the way back from the hospital and was about to join up with the Jian family members to drive him away. Many things hadn't happened yet and many humiliations were yet to suffer.Only after he died, when he learned that this world was a novel, had he learned about his character\u2014A disgusting and annoying cannon fodder, a wealthy fake young master who occupied someone else's throne.An Ran was the center of this world. After he came back, people from the Jian family loved him and spoiled him to death. He stepped on Jian Xingsui's feet and became a recognized nobleman on the Internet. In the end, he fell in love with the actor because of the drama and went to the peak of his life. Meanwhile, he himself? In the end, he had nothing and died in a car accident in a place no one knew. Those cold-blooded readers were hooked with this kind of trope!!!Jian Xingsui sighed. He then raised his head to look at his father and said, \"So, what time is it now, should I go back to my parents?\"Jian Kuo didn't hear the first half of the sentence clearly, but only heard the second half of the sentence: \"Of course, you have to go back!!! Whatsmore TODAY, even if you want to leave you must leave, and even if you don't want to leave you must leave!!! Heh!! None of your tricks will be useful today!''Jian Kuo had already thought about it. No matter what tricks Jian Xingsui plays this time, he will never have any soft-heartedness.\u00a0After going through these things, he was able to see the child's bad nature completely, and he couldn't relax his vigilance at all!However,Jian Xingsui stood up straight, looked at him frankly, and said, \"Okay, I'll leave.\"\"Everything you say is useless, even if you..........wait...what?\"Jian Kuo's words were half choked. He couldn't believe his ears: \"What did you just say?\"Seeing that he didn't understand clearly, Jian Xingsui repeated: \"Then I'll go back to my parents.\"Jian Kuo was just ready to forcibly drive this damn kid away but now his words got stuck in his throat. After holding it for a long time, he could only say: \"Don't even think of playing any kind of tricks!\"Jian Xingsui asked back, \"What tricks did I play?\"Jian Kuo was speechless.The young man standing in the room still had a familiar appearance. His hair had grown long enough to cover his eyes and his head was dyed yellow. His clothes were also too baggy. That cloth could fit 10 more elephants in it!!! But at this moment, the boy was standing there quietly. His tone was neither high nor low. Obviously, he was questioning him back, but there was not any hostility sounded in his tone. He was just asking so calmly. Instead, it seemed that Jian Kuo was an unreasonable one here.Impossible!!! Didn't he know this son of his the best???He has already become a complete bastard. This little fellow acting like this?......humph!!! He is definitely trying to show his useless acting skills!!!Thinking of this, Jian Kuo said loudly, \"You, have you thought about it?\"Jian Xingsui nodded: \"I've said it clearly that I want to leave.\"Jian Kuo was really surprised this time. He was indeed dazzled by anger, but seeing that Jian Xingsui suddenly cooperated a lot, he said, \"It's best if you have thought clearly!\u00a0Over the years, your mother and I have always treated you as a biological child, but what you have done really chills our hearts.\u00a0An Ran is a good boy, so don't resent him. This is the last time I'm warning you. After that, you go back to your biological parents. If you dare to attack Ran Ran again, I will not let you go, understand? \"Jian Kuo only knew that Jian Xingsui had a conflict with An Ran, so he felt that obviously, Jian Xingsui was the one who was trying to attack An Ran. How could he have thought that it was the same innocent and kind child that he was talking about, who had gone to attack Jian Xingsui first? Jian Kuo only knew that An Ran had fainted and was taken to the hospital, but did he know that Jian Xingsui was also injured?The scratched arm under the long-sleeved shirt was still aching, but he didn't feel any pain at all. The grievance and pain in his heart were several times more painful than the pain of that wound. Jian Kuo saw that he was silent but thought it was because the conditions were not enough, so he said, \"There is a cheque on the table, just take it and leave.\"Jian Xingsui sneered after hearing this. In his previous life, even when he died, he still had the last shred of hope in his heart. But now............now that he has lived again and experienced such a scene again, the fire in his heart has been completely extinguished.Even if Jian Kuo doesn't chase him out today, he has to leave.Jian Xingsui said, \"No, I'm willing to leave the house. You can keep this money for the 'frightened and fragile' An Ran to recover his body.\"Jian Kuo choked. He did not expect that Jian Xingsui would refuse.What shocked him, even more, was that after rejecting him, Jian Xingsui opened the door without any nostalgia and was about to walk outside. Jian Kuo subconsciously asked, \"Don't you need to pack your luggage?\"\"Luggage?\" Jian Xingsui seemed to have just reacted. He glanced back at the gorgeous room and smiled: \"Since this house doesn't belong to me, then these things don't belong to me either.\"He walked dashingly without the slightest nostalgia.The young man standing in the corridor walked out of that room. In fact, he had not been away from this place for a long time. After being kicked out of the house in his previous life, he had not come in again for about two years. But now he was back again. It was the place where he had lived for twenty years.\u00a0Looking at it now, it felt extraordinarily unfamiliar. Even though he was prepared, at this moment for some reason, he still felt a little pain in his heart.Twenty years of relationship....but it turned out to be something that even a dude who had appeared only for 2 months could break. He had clearly seen some people's real faces but some feelings were something that couldn't dissipate even if he wanted to. But death was enough to wake him up. Only by leaving this home and this group of people could he feel better.Jian Kuo's voice came from behind: \"You better have thought carefully about it.\"Jian Xingsui recovered from his thoughts. He turned around and looked at Jian Kuo. After staring for a while, he finally bowed to him, as if he had paid back the kindness of his upbringing over the years: \"Please don't forget to take care of yourself.\"The afternoon sun was a bit warm, but the corridor was a bit dim.The wind was blowing from the end of the window and the hem of the boy's clothes fluttered slightly. Not long ago, Jian Kuo hoped that this ignorant child would leave, but at this moment, for some unknown reason, a certain stone in his heart seemed to loosen a bit. After living together for a long time, he finally couldn't help but call out: \"Sui Sui...\"Jian Xingsui bowed and bowed again without being moved by Jian Kuo's call, he only said, \"Goodbye.\"Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJian Xingsui came downstairs and thought that he could leave the house without any obstacles.\u00a0Who knew that as soon as he got downstairs, a man in a suit walked up to him. He had a good appearance, but once he saw Jian Xingsui, his face did not look so good anymore. This was his eldest brother Jian Gu who was also the one who really protected An Ran in his previous life.Sure enough,Jian Xingsui hadn't even said anything yet but the man who stood in front of him opened his mouth: \"Dad talked to you?\"Jian Xingsui nodded, \"Yes.\"\"And then?\" Jian Gu looked at him condescendingly, with a tone that was almost disdainful: \"How much did you charge your father?\"\"...\"Jian Xingsui was a little speechless: \"I didn't.\"Jian Gu raised his eyebrows in disgust: \"You still think that's not enough?\"Jian Xingsui was directly blocked by his words and didn't know what to say. The main reason was that he was too speechless, and he didn't know what to do for a while, but in Jian Gu's eyes, it was as if he was agreeing with his words.Jian Gu sneered: \"Jian Xingsui, eldest brother was actually right about your true face. Don't you have any feelings of benevolence and righteousness in your mind or is it just filled with all money and cheap tricks?\"Jian Xingsui was inexplicably scolded again.Jian Gu was strongly biased with his own opinions and said coldly, \"Tell me, how much do you want?\"\"...\"The last trace of sadness in Jian Xingsui's heart disappeared. He has to leave anyway and he will have nothing to do with this group of people in the future. Why should he suffer from this stranger's anger. He immediately raised his eyebrows and his voice was loud: \"I said I didn't receive it. Are you deaf?\"Jian Gu's face changed.From childhood to adulthood, this younger brother of his has always been spoiled and naughty, but he would still be a little more restrained in front of him. What he had never expected was that Jian Xingsui would actually dare to speak to him in such a tone.Jian Xingsui looked straight at him and retorted: \"You said that I don't have any feelings of benevolence and righteousness in my mind but then every time you open your mouth, it's all about money this and money that.'' He smirked, ''May I ask, just how much benevolence and righteousness is present in that 'noble' mind of yours?\"Jian Gu's eyes flickered. Who was he?? Of course, he had to show the CEO's aura: \"Jian Xingsui, is this how you talk with your elders? You have no education at all!\"Jian Xingsui smiled. This time it was true. He laughed from the bottom of his heart. He raised his face and looked at the person in front of him: \"Are you still considered my elder?\"The man standing in the living room was empty-handed.Jian Xingsui was very indifferent: \"Didn't I just get kicked out today?\"Jian Gu couldn't refute: \"You...\"\"This.......Mister.\" Jian Xingsui was too lazy to entangle with him any longer: \"If there is nothing else, can you get out of the way? I'm in a hurry.\"Jian Gu subconsciously gave way. He was someone who was admired by everyone in the company. He is also complimented outside the Jian family. Today, he learned that An Ran was bullied by his disgusting younger brother again. He hurried back and wanted to reprimand him, but who would have thought that Jian Xingsui would be the one to scold the shit out of him. What's more, he couldn't even refute this fucker!\"Jian Xingsui!\"Seeing that the person was about to leave, the CEO opened his mouth to stop him, trying to save a little bit of face for himself.Jian Xingsui paused. He stood at the door and looked back: \"What's wrong?\"Jian Gu's eyes were bright.\u00a0The president in a suit and tie looked stern, as if he was firing some employee:\u00a0\"If you leave this house today, you will no longer be the child of our Jian family, nor will you be my younger brother Jian Gu. An Ran will be the young master of the Jian family. I hope you will not use the name of my Jian family to do some evil things in the future and be a good person!\"Jian Xingsui: \"Are you finished?\"Why did Jian Gu felt that his words were being treated as a fart? He was usually a bit arrogant kind of person but today this idiot fellow actually dared to challenge his ego and arrogance. At this moment, he couldn't completely reprimand Jian Xingsui and felt a little depressed, but there was nothing he could do. So he had to add a sentence at the end: \"You better remember this, otherwise I will no longer care about the past feelings.\"Jian Xingsui said, \"You never seemed to have cared in the first place ah.\"Jian Gu: \"...\"A mocking smile appeared in Jian Xingsui's eyes, and he waved at him: \"GOOD!!! BYE!!!\"After coming out of the Jian family's big house, fresh air came from outside, and Jian Xingsui felt that his breathing was much smoother. It seemed that everyone in that house had deep malice towards him and that kind of oppression was really............. overwhelming. It was even hard for him to breathe there but when he came out, he soon found himself in a difficult situation - Where were his biological parents?Everyone had immediately asked him to go back to his biological parents. But the question was, where were those two people?He hadn't gone back to them at all in his previous life and had stayed to entangle with An Ran. Later, after he had taken the cheque, he had gone to live in the hotel. He hadn't cared about his so-called biological parents from the beginning to the end, and he had never gone back.\u00a0Even if they had met later, it had been an appointment in some restaurant. But now.........very good!\u00a0 He doesn't even know the address.Jian Xingsui subconsciously reached out to his pocket, but he hadn't expected to find something:\"A note?\"That was a piece of paper that seemed to have been torn apart, with an address written on it. It should be the address of his biological parents. It was probably given to him by someone before, and he had put it away casually.Jian Xingsui sighed: \"Fortunately...\"For Jian Xingsui, who had just been reborn, he had a clear understanding of many things now. So he was willing to try more.In this life, he didn't ask for money, so naturally, he had nowhere to go. If he will meet his so-called biological parents, then he might have a different outcome.Jian Xingsui looked at the three-kilometer route and still sighed: \"If I knew earlier, I should have accepted that cheque. At least tonight, I could have stayed at the hotel for one night.\"......But fortunately, this body of his was not as haggard as when he had died in the previous life. He won't be too tired after walking a long distance.His ''biological'' parents lived on a street in a small urban area. After leaving the wealthy area of the Jian family, the old town here was definitely giving a different feeling to him. People were coming and going on electric cars, tricycles, and there were hawkers on the roadside yelling and selling seasonal fruits.Jian Xingsui looked there and felt that it was quite lively there.According to the address on the note, he came to a small shop. His ''biological'' parents were involved in a small business. They seemed to have been selling rice cakes.\u00a0It's just that for some reason, they hadn't opened their shop today. After thinking about it, he found a chair at the door of the store to sit down and wait for them.Many people passing by on the side of the road casted curious glances at him. When the sun set in the west, someone at the end of the intersection finally walked over. As they walked, the couple was still talking:\u00a0\"Ran Ran is indeed frightened. I really felt distressed when I saw him.\"The man said, \"That kid from the Jian family is really lawless. Look at him scaring Ran Ran so casually!!!\"The woman sighed with a sad look: \"Our dear Ran Ran is really pitiful.\u00a0Whenever I think of how he won't live at home in the future, and I will rarely be able to see him, my heart feels like it is being stabbed by a sharp knife.\"The man quickly comforted her: \"Don't be too sad! No matter whether Ran Ran lives with us or not, in our hearts, he will always be our only child. Our feeling will never change.\"The woman was relieved and nodded.Jian Xingsui, who was sitting at the door of the store, met the two of them under such circumstances.The couple was stunned for a moment, and then they reacted. They pointed at Jian Xingsui in disbelief and said, \"You, why are you here?\"Jian Xingsui felt a little inexplicable. He asked back, \"I shouldn't have come?\"Reasonably speaking, isn't he, their own biological child? The couple's reaction was really inexplicable and made him feel helpless. He actually had come here with so much hope..................but now his heart was only able to feel the coldness and nothing else.The woman was still a little shocked, but the man was the first to speak: \"You are Suisui??\"Jian Xingsui nodded.The couple didn't seem to be very excited when they saw their biological child. But it couldn't be said as hate, it was more like they didn't know how to get along with him.When the man went to open the door, the woman said to Jian Xingsui: \"My name is Zhang Xia, he is Zhang Xiangyang.\u00a0We are involved in the shop business, and our home is above this shop. You should already know this ba? \"Jian Xingsui actually didn't know, but he still nodded, \"I know.\"The door opened, and Zhang Xia said awkwardly, \"Come in then.\"Their store indeed sold rice cakes. There were many tools for steaming and making rice cakes on display, but they were all well organized and the environment looked clean and refreshing.Zhang Xiangyang walked in front and introduced, \"Our family just relies on such a small shop. It's not as good as Jian's. I don't know if you'll be able to get used to it.\"Jian Xingsui replied, \"It doesn't matter, it's very clean. It's already very good.\"Zhang Xia was a little surprised after hearing this. She used to think that Jian Xingsui was too disobedient, and a spoiled young master with a bad temper. Although he was her own child, she had never lived together with him and had no feelings for him.\u00a0So there was still some resistance, but she didn't expect the child to change shoes from the time he entered the door, and now, this kid seemed to be very polite.She smiled and said, \"It's fine if you don't dislike it. Our place is indeed clean. Ran Ran is a diligent child who often helps us with work, he is that kind of sensible child.\"Jian Xingsui nodded thoughtfully.The protagonist was the protagonist. He was popular and pampered wherever he went. He must have many good qualities. This was definitely understandable and worth learning.Instead, Zhang Xiangyang coughed and said, \"Well, Xing Sui, you should live in this room.\"Jian Xingsui came over and the door was opened. This should be a study room with a platform bed. The opposite wall had a high bookshelf. There was a table under the only window in the room.\u00a0At first glance, this room was obviously not made for permanently living purposes. It was too small and it did not face the sun. Whether it was compared to his own room or the house before his rebirth, it was very shabby.But Jian Xingsui didn't really care about this. He turned around and glanced at the room next to him: \"Is that room yours?\"Zhang Xiangyang replied, \"No, that's Ran Ran's room.\"Jian Xingsui glanced at Zhang Xiangyang lightly. Although he didn't speak, that light glance contained too many emotions, which made the other two people feel guilty for no reason.Zhang Xia at the back explained a little bluntly: \"Well...... because Ran Ran just moved out in the past two days, there are a lot of things in his room that hasn't been taken out yet, so it's not convenient for you to live in there. After some time, you can live there.\"Jian Xingsui sneered: \"Can't you take those things out now and put it in the study. It's even more convenient to pack it up and take it with him when he comes back?\"Zhang Xia and Zhang Xiangyang looked at each other, but they were speechless.In the end, it was Zhang Xiangyang who explained: \"Ran Ran has a lot of gadgets, some of them are more expensive ones. So we don't want to mess around with them. We're afraid we'll break them. Xing Sui, you are also a child of a big family, you should know this better than us?\"Jian Xingsui smiled. The emotions in his eyes gradually faded. When he entered the shabby room, he only left a light sentence: \"Up to you guys ba.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Jian Xingsui returned to his room, he sat beside the bed to rest.While sitting beside the bed, he accidentally touched his own wound. After rolling up his long sleeves, he saw there were many dazzling scratches. He had gotten these gifts when he had been pushed down and fell. Of course, these were not the gifts that our dear protagonist An Ran himself had given him. Instead, he had fallen when he had been pushed by the security guard who was patrolling the street.Everyone said that An Ran was kind and simple, but Jian Xingsui didn't think so. An Ran himself had come to find him and had tried to deliberately insult him to provoke him. He took advantage of the time when the security guard came and finally fainted in the pose of a victim. Obviously, he was unscathed, but everyone felt that he was wronged and bullied. And when it came to him, everyone felt that he was the only one who was guilty of the worst crime.Jian Xingsui poked the wound, and unconsciously took a breath: \"Hiss...\"It hurt.....He knew his stupid ass should have gone to buy some medicine in the afternoon earlier.He didn't know if there was any anti-inflammatory water in this house, or should he go out and buy some himself.Jian Xingsui came out of the room, but he didn't see the couple. So he didn't have to greet them while going downstairs. He was not familiar with the environment here, but at this time many people were getting off work in the evening.\u00a0When they saw him coming out of the couple's shop, they all looked at him, and some people even commented in a not so small voice:\"Is that the child you were talking about?\"\"I heard that his conduct is very poor.\"\"Look at the clothes he's wearing, tsk tsk...\"When Jian Xingsui heard what they said, he simply stopped when he was passing through a glass door and looked at himself now. He was wearing ripped trousers, his hair was yellow, and his bangs were so long that his eyes were covered. His whole existence was shouting that he was a local thug or even a hooligan.He simply abandoned the thought of going to the pharmacy and directly went to a barber shop instead.The owner of the barber shop was stunned when he saw him. He nervously said, \"Young man, do you want to wash your hair or what hairstyle do you want?\"After reliving his whole life, Jian Xingsui's aesthetics were not the same as before. In his past life, he liked to pursue trends and fashion. He was simply following his heart, so he had thought that pursuing fashion and being stylish was his personality which made him look cool. But now it was unknown why, he seemed to have a different idea after being reborn once: \"Cut it directly, and I want to dye it black.\"The barber shop owner said, \"okay, okay.\"Because the two sides reached an agreement quickly, they acted quickly. His hair was dyed black and the long bangs were cut off. The face of the person who looked a little gloomy at first was completely revealed.\u00a0He actually had a pair of big eyes that were very energetic. But they were always covered by his cool\u00a0bangs. Now that he was clean and tidy, his whole appearance seemed to be completely new.The barber shop owner said: \"It is said that to test a person's appearance, you'll have to cut an inch of their hair. Young dude, you really are good-looking.\"Jian Xingsui took a general look and smiled lightly: \"Thank you.\"The boy with red lips and white teeth showed a shy smile in the mirror. The barber shop owner was stunned and said with a slight emotion, \"You look pretty when you smile. As soon as you entered the store, I was a little nervous.\"Jian Xingsui was suspicious: \"Why?\"\"That......I don't know.\" The owner of the barbershop was also an honest man. He touched his head and said naively, \"Maybe it's just because of the aura you emitted when you entered..... I don't know how to describe it.\"He couldn't tell, but Jian Xingsui could at least guess why.In the world of this book, he is a vicious cannon fodder character. So of course he naturally emits the aura of vicious cannon fodder. It is destined that many people will not like him at first sight, and will even develop a heart of resistance and vigilance. It was the exact opposite of the protagonist, who had an aura of affinity and was naturally likable.Some people were born to be the rising sun in the sky. But he was different. He was mud on the ground.Seeing that his expression was not very good, the boss hesitated: \"Did I say something wrong?\"\"No.\" Jian Xingsui's eyes were a little indifferent: \"You are quite right.\"So what if he is nothing but the mud? In his previous life, he had tried hard to please everyone and ended up with a tragic end. In this life, he just wanted to stay away from the junk of the Jian family, and never wanted to please anyone again.The boss saw that he was a little silent. He thought that he was bored: \"I'll show you the TV.\"The TV was turned on, and the TV show on it was \" The Battle of the World\". It was the drama starring film emperor Fu Jinxiao which was today's most popular show with the most amount of discussion topics and highest popularity.The boss was also afraid that Jian Xingsui could not understand it, so he recommended it to him: \"Don't just watch this as an ordinary war movie. It's just more than that. Film emperor Fu's acting skills are outstanding. My wife and children all like him.\u00a0There are also many little girls who come to me to cut their hair who are his absolute fans. Do you know him, he did a good job in this drama. There was also one of his movies based on the republican era before. What was it called..............\"Jian Xingsui opened his lips: \"Mission\"The boss clapped his hands: \"Yes, Mission! Hey....... How did you know, young man, this movie was quite unpopular. After all, it was one of the Fu Jinxiao's early work.\"Jian Xingsui replied in a low voice, \"I'm his fan.\"In the past and present, if there was one thing that had not changed, it was his idol. He had admired and liked Fu Jinxiao since he was young. As long as it was Film emperor Fu's work, he would look at each of them over and over again.\u00a0Unlike many fans who followed him afterward because of his fame, he had been following that person since Fu Jinxiao's first album debut.\u00a0He had been supporting Fu Jinxiao ever since he had very few Weibo fans, and in the following years, he had never been slacking off when it came to Fu Jinxiao.It's a pity that he didn't get to see his idol even when he had died.Later, after learning that this was a novel world, he also accidentally discovered that the real young master, An Ran, was the protagonist.His hard work and talent caught Fu Jinxiao's attention. After that, An Ran's journey in the entertainment industry went smoothly, and he worked together with Film emperor Fu to make many movies. Because of a drama that both of them starred in, the two finally united and became married, while Jian Xingsui died in a nameless street with nothing.The boss said, \"Young man, did my cutting force hurt you? Why are your eyes red?\"Jian Xingsui pulled away from his memories. He looked at himself in the mirror and smiled: \"No, I haven't slept nicely these days. I'm just a bit sleepy.\"\"Young people these days......tsk tsk... they like to stay up all night.\" The boss said, \"How is this a nice thing? It's better to treat yourself well and you should wake up now.\"Jian Xingsui nodded lightly as if telling both the boss and to himself: \"Yes, it's time to wake up...\"......The next dayA nanny car was driving on the street. In the back of the car sat a man wearing sunglasses who was closing his eyes. The man was wearing a light coffee-colored coat.\u00a0His slender legs were folded, and he was reclining lazily in the back seat. His almost perfect jawline gave him a look of being a bit indifferent. Beside him, there was someone who was constantly chattering.Agent Wang Meican said helplessly, \"My dear brother, very handsome bro, dear ancestor, are you listening?\"Fu Jinxiao responded lightly.Wang Meican handed the band-Aid to him: \"That private meal at the airport yesterday was too scary. There was actually such a sharp knife. Have you cleaned the wound on your arm? Do you want to go to the hospital for a look? I didn't have time, so I brought some band-aid here.\"Fu Jinxiao took the band-did and played with it in his hand. He replied casually, \"It's not that serious.\"The agent wanted to say even more: \"I've told you many times that even dedication should have some limits. You got off the plane in the early morning while still being injured. And even when you were injured, you still needed to take into account the mood of the fans. You didn't go through the VIP pass just for them, you...\"Fu Jinxiao responded, \"I know where limits lie clearly in my heart.\"The manager was about to say something when she heard the man's \"tsk\".\u00a0He took off his sunglasses and revealed his inky eyes that were dark and deep. The man's voice was low and slow. While chuckling softly, he said: \"Great manager mam, it's just a little injury. It's not worth your 10000 words lecture, right?\"Although it was an interrogative sentence, Wang Meican shut up.She had followed Fu Jinxiao for many years, so she knew when to stop her nagging.This man is well-known in the circle as a good-tempered man. He has a good reputation and is unpretentious, but he is actually very cold in his bones, with a deep calculation under his smiling face. Dealing with this Fu Jinxiao, one must know their limits. Otherwise, you never know, when will be your funeral!The driver in the front seat said, \"Sir, the shop you're looking for is right up front.\"This was a narrow street, surrounded by scattered shops, selling food and toys. There were many people coming and going, but it was definitely not the place where Film emperor Fu usually comes.The agent said, \"If you want to buy something, I'll get out of the car and buy it for you?\"\"No need.\" Fu Jinxiao waved his hand: \"I have been in the car for a long time. I'll go down to get some air.\"The agent just gave up.The weather in August was a bit hot. There was a pavilion outside the small shop selling rice cakes.\u00a0There were many people sitting under the pavilion eating pastries and chatting. The business of this store was good, and there was a small queue outside. Fu Jinxiao stood at the end and happened to hear a few girls discussing the latest gossip.\"Have you seen that on Weibo?\"\"I saw that. Film emperor Fu actually made his own fans wait for nothing.\"\"I liked Brother Fu very much. Why is he suddenly like this?\"\"I don't know what happened to him in the past two years. I heard that his previous movie \"Jinghua\" also flopped.\"Fu Jinxiao stood not far away and listened casually, but there was no response.He is used to seeing too many fans in the entertainment industry who chase after the fame of other people. These kinds of fans who stop following their ''idol'' after seeing one-sided events didn't bother him much. Their words' effects were useless on him.A boy in a white hat came out of the store. He had come out with the cakes in the tray. It was unknown how long and how much he had listened. After the boy put the things on the tables of several girls, he said, \"I'm sorry but I want to correct that the main actor starring in the movie \"Jinghua\" is not Mr. Fu.\"Those few little girls were stunned.After Jian Xingsui straightened his waist, his tone was plain but clear: \"Mr. Fu starred as a supporting character in \"Jinghua\", not as the main actor. And also this film did not flop.\u00a0It won the Best Film Editing Award and the Best Original Arrangement Award in Magnolia in 2018. At that time, Mr. Fu who had only acted as a supporting character in the movie had also won the Best Supporting Actor Award.\"His words didn't flutter even once while saying these words. Those few little girls were stunned when they heard it. Passers-by fans had no power to backhand in front of die-hard fans.Fu Jinxiao, who was originally careless, also raised his head and set his eyes on the young man under the sun. His usual indifferent eyes were filled with a little interest.The little girl murmured to retort: \"Then isn't the news of him making his fans wait for nothing true???\"Jian Xingsui sneered. Holding the tray, he answered without any fear: \"Just at one glance one can tell that the video was edited. Mr. Fu had once mentioned in an interview in 2016 that\u00a0he only accepts letters from fans but not gifts, so what's wrong with him rejecting expensive gifts from fans?\"The girl with long hair was not convinced: \"Then he simply couldn't live up to the fans' wishes ah.\"Jian Xingsui's thoughts were very clear, and he answered without arrogance: \"The airport has always had a VIP pass for VIP people. Because he had his flight in the early morning, the fans had waited outside all night. So instead of the VIP pass which was a way lot more convenient path for him, he just went through the ordinary pass in order not to let the fans lose heart who were waiting for him since the middle of the night. Now I want to ask you where did he leave his fans waiting for nothing?\"The little girls on the table were left speechless.A battle between die-hard fans and passersby fans, it was obvious who would win.The girl with long hair said embarrassingly, \"Why do you defend him so much? Who are you to him? How do you remember everything about him so clearly?\"......The whole area was silent for a moment.After a while,Jian Xingsui leaned a bit towards the girls. His tone was calm and no one knew the sadness he had hidden underneath his voice. He replied, \"I'm not anyone special, just a passerby.\"2Not only the three little girls looked at Jian Xingsui in shock, but Film Emperor Fu who was behind those girls also raised his eyebrows.When Jian Xingsui passed the queue, his delicate face still looked a bit immature. He obviously was a very young boy, but unexpectedly, he remembered something that had happened several years ago so clearly.Is he really just a ................... passerby?Fu Jinxiao's eyes fell on the boy's back, and a faint smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. This young boy...............interesting...!!!....................................................The author has something to say:Film emperor Fu: Boy, you caught my attention!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEverything in the little shop was going well. It was unknown why but business was going so well today. Mr. Zhang and his wife were making rice cakes inside, and Jian Xingsui was helping outside, doing bill collection work. It was a bit messy for Jian Xingsui to work there first, but after learning for a while, his movements had become more familiar.\u00a0Although not as good as a professional, fortunately, he still acted nicely when facing customers.The surrounding people were noisy. He had lowered his head and was busy looking for money. When the other two were busy preparing cakes for others, it was the next customer's turn. A slightly low-pitched male voice sounded above his head: \"Hello, please pack two glutinous rice cake dumplings and another set of your family's signature set meal.\"Jian Xingsui froze.Somehow a very familiar voice entered into his ears. It was an ordinary afternoon, but Jian Xingsui's heart suddenly seemed to have missed a beat. He raised his head suddenly. The person in front of him was wearing a coffee-colored coat, sunglasses, and a mask.\u00a0Even though he couldn't see his face clearly, his hands began to tremble uncontrollably, and even his breathing began to tighten. If you have been a die-hard fan of someone for many years, you can definitely tell who that person is just by listening to their voice.Zhang Xia's voice came from behind: \"Sui Sui, this dumpling is ready.\"Jian Xingsui quickly recovered and said to the customer, \"Okay, please wait a moment.\"He was in turmoil.\u00a0The noise of the surrounding people, coupled with the interruption of the woman, made the originally determined heart of his hesitated. How could Film emperor Fu come to such a place? Even after thinking using his toes, it's impossible for him to come here, right? Maybe people who have similar voices exist in this world. Besides, who was he? A mere vicious cannon fodder. Could he still dare to imagine that there will be such good luck as meeting the protagonist so casually?He tried to calm himself down. It was definitely impossible.Zhang Xia put the prepared set in the tray, and Jian Xingsui packed it and handed it to Fu Jinxiao. He had calmed down a bit. So he said, \"Hello, the total is 67 yuan. May I ask if you are paying through cash or scan code.\"Fu Jinxiao: \"Cash.\"The man took out the wallet from his pocket. It was a pure black wallet. The brand name was not clear. The style was very classic. There were neatly arranged cards.\u00a0He took out a hundred yuan bill and handed it to Jian Xingsui. His slender fingers were pale and clean. His familiar set of movements made Jian Xingsui ecstatic for a moment.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows. His eyes fell on Jian Xingsui and he asked, \"What's wrong?\"Jian Xingsui quickly returned to his senses. His ears even blushed a little because of shame.He actually stared at the hand of a strange customer in a daze! It's really a fool's behavior. What a shameless thug he is!!!1\"No, nothing!\" Jian Xingsui hurriedly put away the money. He opened the cash drawer and began to get the change for the bills. Because of the range of motion, his sleeve slipped down, revealing the wound that had not fully healed yet.\u00a0But he didn't notice it, and handed the change to Fu Jinxiao: \"Your change.\"Fu Jinxiao nodded lightly: \"Thank you.\"The man just glanced around at his own change. He took out a 20 yuan bill and handed it to Jian Xingsui and said, \"You gave me more, you should have given me a ten yuan bill.\"Because he was too flustered, he had given him the wrong money bill!Jian Xingsui felt that he didn't know where to hide this shameless face of his. So he quickly took the money and bowed, \"I'm sorry.\"The Zhang couple behind him cast exploratory glances. Jian Xingsui quickly found a ten-yuan bill and handed it to Fu Jinxiao, and also reminded him:\u00a0\"Try not to eat too much of the dumplings you pack at night, as they are not easy to digest. If you can't finish eating them, you can store them in the refrigerator.\"Fu Jinxiao took the change: \"Thank you for reminding me.\"Jian Xingsui's heart was still chaotic. He wanted to be sure, but he wasn't sure. Heaven is dry and my heart is being fry and I don't want to cry............WHAT TO DO WHAT TO DO??? HIS IDOL IS LEAVING HIS IDOL IS LEAVING!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHJust when he was a ''little'' flustered, a voice came from above his head: \"Then let me remind you too.\"Jian Xingsui was stunned for a moment. He then raised his head in surprise.The tall man stood across the counter. He picked up his things and spoke slowly: \"If you are injured, you still need to pay attention to the wound. The weather is hot and it is easy to get inflamed.\"Jian Xingsui froze in place. The wound on his arm was not fully healed because he hadn't been treated properly. However, after getting along for a few days, the Zhang couple still turned a blind eye to his wound.\u00a0As for the man in front of him, they had just met by chance, but he noticed it. This feeling was very strange. A warm feeling flooded into his heart. After taking a closer look, he found that there was actually a band-aid on the counter.HE had left it there........Jian Xingsui didn't know why, but at this moment all of his hesitations were thrown away. He looked at the person's leaving back and said, \"Thank you!\"When he picked up the band-aid, its temperature was still hot, as if it was still covered in that man's body temperature. He...........might be his IDOL.......He might be himmm..................... If he will miss this opportunity, he might never be able to see him again. Jian Xingsui gathered up his courage and looked at him. He said, \"May I know who you are, next time... I'll thank you properly again.\"The man stopped and turned around: \"No need to be too modest.\"Very strange............ Obviously, Jian Xingsui couldn't see the other man's complete face. But when he stood in the sun, Jian Xingsui's heartbeat was still unstable. The tall man had an elegant breath all over his body. He curled his lips: \"As for who I am... ...\"Jian Xingsui looked at him and saw the man wave at him. His tone seemed to contain a bit of a mocking smile, but it made Jian Xingxui's heart feel hot: ''I'm not anyone special, just a passerby.''......The same evening,The shop was closed and Jian Xingsui also returned to his room.He was sitting beside the bed and was still reminiscing about the afternoon. He really would not mistake Fu Jinxiao's voice. No matter how much he told himself it was impossible, he still thought that person should be Film emperor Fu himself. If it was someone else, it was indeed possible that he would recognize the wrong person. But the person opposite to him was someone who he had been following for almost ten years.Fu Yingdi debuted as a singer at the age of 19, and Jian Xingsui was only 15 years old at that time. After hearing his singing on a street corner by chance, Xingsui's feelings for him had been uncontrollable. For countless times over the past ten years, he had been quietly pursuing him behind his back, step by step, witnessing Fu Jinxiao's transformation from being an unknown star to being a big hit, from being adored by people and being hated on the Internet, to a large number of fans throwing shades to him to, In the end, his fame and he himself shining brightly to ascending to the film emperor's throne, during all these period of time, he had never left following that man.Is it really him...Jian Xingsui held the band-aid in his hand. He was even reluctant to use it, looking at it over and over.Thinking of the final end of the book of Film emperor Fu and Jian Anran getting married in the original novel, his heart ached for a while. According to the laws of the world, can a vicious cannon fodder have such an opportunity? Thinking about it, Jian Xingsui suddenly froze after remembering a certain plot point\u2014If going through the plot of his previous life accordingly, An Ran had still lived in the rice cake shop because Jian Xing had refused to leave the Jian family's house........ That means An Ran and Fu Jinxiao should have met this afternoon!WHAT IN THE DEMON'S HOLE??????????Because he was reborn and made a different choice, the butterfly effect's wings were slightly flapped, causing the current situation?Jian Xingsui went to the bed and breathed a long sigh of relief: \"No way...\"\"Jingle Bell Jingle Bell\"His cell phone rang.Jian Xingsui picked it up, but he didn't expect that it was the phone call from his agent who had not been in contact with him for 800 years. In case you are lost, Yes, he had also signed with an entertainment company.\u00a0But he was still just an amateur, because firstly he had just graduated, and secondly, he had been focusing on fighting with An Ran before. So he hadn't wanted to do his personal things well at all.The agent said, \"Xiao Sui, how are you doing? I've heard everything about you. Everyone has their own good times and bad times. But one should never give up, you know?\"\"Brother Wang.\" Jian Xingsui said honestly, \"Don't worry, I'm fine.\"The agent breathed a sigh of relief. He said, \"All's good as long as you're fine. So I have a variety show in my hands now, and I have invited more than 100 amateurs to participate in the final debut. I think it's quite suitable for you, you... are you going to participate?\"Jian Xingsui thought of this show. He indeed remembered a variety show from his previous life, so he asked, \"Is it the \"Starlight\"?\"Bro Wang, the agent, was shocked: \"How do you know?\"Jian Xingsui couldn't explain it, so he could only say: \"I have heard a little about it, but I don't understand it in detail.\"Brother Wang took the phone and said, \"This is a good opportunity. It will give you more chances to show your face and show your talents. If you are lucky, you will make your debut in a group, and you will have a bright future.\"Jian Xingsui knew that it was impossible for him to make his debut in a group.In the last life, the protagonist An Ran relied on this variety show to become popular and finally debuted. Whatsmore, the mentor invited by this variety show was now the popular top actor Fu Jinxiao.\u00a0This was an indispensable plot in the novel for the protagonist Shou and Fu Yingdi to develop their relationship. But he hadn't participated in that variety show in his previous life, because he had just been kicked out of the house at that time and he was staying in the hotel with a cheque.Brother Wang asked him, \"What is it? Are you going or not?\"Jian Xingsui hesitated: \"I'll consider it.\"Of course, he wanted to go. If he went, he might be able to meet his idol. Moreover, he was jobless right now and had no source of income at all. It was a perfect opportunity for him. But he didn't want to have anything to do with An Ran or the Jian family anymore. His death in his previous life still seemed to be vivid in his eyes. He knew that he will not end well if he goes against the protagonist again. Now he just wanted to stay away from An Ran and it was best for him to not see him again in this life.Brother Wang sighed: \"Then you can call me anytime in the next two days.\"Jian Xingsui responded.Almost as soon as the call was hung up, there was a knock on the door.Jian Xingsui sat up and said, \"Please come in.\"It was Zhang Xia who opened the door. She said, \"Sui Sui, come down to eat.\"Jian Xingsui responded and followed her downstairs. He still lived in that small study room. The key point was that there was no air conditioner in this study, only an electric fan. It was very hot in summer. Fortunately, the air conditioner was turned on below, which finally made him feel much cooler.Zhang Xia gave him a bowl of noodles: \"Sui Sui, is this enough?\"Jian Xingsui said, \"Yes it's enough.\"He didn't sit down to eat directly, but went into the back room and took chopsticks and a bowl to help.After Zhang Xiangyang closed the door outside and came in for dinner, only then did they start to eat together. In the past few days, except for when Jian Xingsui went to help with the shop in the afternoon, they all had their meals together.Zhang Xia said, \"I did the math today and it seems that we sold more than 1,000 pieces today.\"Zhang Xiangyang nodded and said, \"Now is the weekend, of course, the business will run more smoothly.\"\"I roughly calculated the quantity and materials of the rice dumplings and those cakes. Today we probably earned more than 2,000.\" Zhang Xia was a woman who was very good at calculating: \"But the amount sold the day before yesterday was about the same, but the amount we had earned was about 3,000 ah.\"Zhang Xiangyang ate the noodles and said,\u00a0\"It should be because of the quality difference of different types of goods. An Ran had helped to collect the bill the day before yesterday. It's Suishui now, so I don't know.\"Jian Xingsui finally understood what the purpose of this meal was.\"I have recorded every account on the machine.\" Jian Xingsui put down the tableware and said, \"If there is anything unclear, you can check it out.\"Seeing that he was a little unhappy, Zhang Xia hurriedly said:\u00a0\"Sui Sui, that's not what I meant. Look, when a gentleman came this afternoon, you seemed to have given the wrong change. It must have been because of your carelessness. It must be hard for you. You were a young master before, and you must have never done this kind of work.\u00a0Otherwise, I will collect the bill later, and you will help Xiang Yang in the back...\"It was because the shop was busy these days that Jian Xingsui wanted to help with the cashier.He didn't expect to face such doubts from his ''own'' parents. Looking at Zhang Xia's face, he suddenly thought of An Ran.\u00a0He finally understood where the protagonist's set of tricks and acting skills came from and how similar it was from ''his'' parents.Jian Xingsui's mouth curled into a sarcastic smile and said, \"No need.\"Zhang Xia was taken aback.\"I'm going to work in two days and I'll probably live in the company's dormitory, so I might not come back here.\" Jian Xingsui stood up: \"If the two of you are really busy, I'll hire a helper in the store. Well, I am inexperienced in working as a bill collector, so I am indeed incompetent.\"Zhang Xiangyang didn't expect this to happen. He glared at his wife and said quickly, \"Sui Sui, don't misunderstand, that's not what your aunt....... your mother meant, why do you want to move out?\"Jian Xingsui stood from the table and looked at him. He took a panoramic view of the faces of the two, and opened his lips: \"Whether I misunderstood or not, I think you guys know better than me.\u00a0I am indeed not as good as An Ran, but I have clean hands and feet, and I will never do any shameful deeds for a few hundred yuans. I don't know why you look at me like that with those cheap eyes of yours. In the past 20 years, I might have wronged An Ran by sitting on his throne all these years but I have never wronged you guys.''On the contrary,The one who held the wrong child and directed your schemes resulting in all those tragedies, and the one who had wronged your own child........are you guys.Jian Xingsui didn't say anything after he threw out the words. He turned around and went back upstairs. He then closed the door, took out his mobile phone and called the agent: \"Brother Wang, I'm sorry to bother you. I just wanted to tell you that......the variety show you talked about, I'll go.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAbout participating in that variety show, Jian Xingsui finally thought it over.The worst thing he did in his previous life was to go against the protagonist shou. It was all because he did not believe in fate and was unwilling to be separated from the Jian family. He felt that he could go back to the past, which is why he ended up like that. So from now on, as long as he no longer opposes the protagonist and avoids him everywhere, he will be fine.No matter how bad it will be after he participates in that program, if he still won't be able to escape, he will simply withdraw from the competition with 20,000 yuan, and then find another job. Anyway, that amount of money will be enough to ensure that he will not starve to death.Sitting in the car going to the audition site, Jian Xingsui kept hearing Brother Wang talking next to him:\u00a0\"You really have to seize this opportunity, you know, I have inquired, this time the show is inviting Fu Jinxiao as one of the mentors. What does this mean, this means popularity! This show will really be a hit. I dare to say that this show will put all the other shows to shame......God himself will come to earth to personally watch this show!!! This show has Fu Jinxiao!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! F U J I N X I A O!!!!! WHO??? FUJINXIAO!!!!As long as you hear Fu Jianxiao's name in any show, you know that show will burst out with popularity.Jian Xingsui seemed to suddenly think of something: \"In this audition, will Brother Fu come?\"This question stopped the fantasy of the agent.Brother Wang scratched his head and said hesitantly, \"It shouldn't be possible. The Film emperor Fu is so busy. How could he come for such a thing as an audition? He will probably come after the recording of the show starts.\"Jian Xingsui nodded: \"It makes sense.\"Brother Wang patted him on the shoulder and said, \"Don't think about it so much. I went out to see your horoscope today. Today is your lucky day. You can definitely do it.\"Jian Xingsui smiled and said, \"I hope so.\"He didn't know if the day was auspicious or not, but when he first stepped into the floor of the audition place, before he had gone far, he saw a somewhat familiar back, or in other words, a back that he was very familiar with in his previous life.An Ran was originally talking happily with the people around him.\u00a0The moment Jian Xingsui appeared in the corridor and when he also looked sideways, An Ran's face froze, as if his body trembled slightly.Jian Xingsui: What an auspicious day ah!!!Sure enough, along with An Ran's changes in his expression, the man standing beside An Ran also looked at him. Unfortunately, that person was also someone whom Jian Xingsui knew. That dude was the first among many dogs who licked the protagonist shou An Ran in the early volume of the book. Ohno! how can someone call him a dog ne? He was the affectionate male supporting actor, Zhou Xun, who was the son of a nouveau riche. He was a little rich and powerful. He appeared when the protagonist An Ran was still a Cinderella doing a hard job in a rice cake shop. His role??? Of course, it was to shower the protagonist with money, flowers, and probably warmth.Of course, his role also included helping the protagonist to slap the face of the vicious cannon fodder aka his face, and eradicate himself.In his previous life, Zhou Xun often pushed himself against him.\u00a0Later, after he was kicked out of the house, he even bullied himself openly and took the lead for the protagonist to eradicate him. Unfortunately, after An Ran became famous in the entertainment industry, he kicked Zhou Xun under the pretext of avoiding suspicion and wanting to pursue a career with peace of mind.Sure enough,Before Jian Xingsui approached, Zhou Xun stepped forward to protect An Ran behind him and looked at him fiercely: \"What are you doing here?\"4Behind him, An Ran's small face was wrinkled. He also looked at him as if facing a great enemy.Jian Xingsui was speechless: \"Why can't I come?\"\"Do you still want to hurt Ran Ran?\" Zhou Xun was tall and strong. He looked like he was going to fight with Jian Xingsui: \"I am telling you, if there's something, just come at me.\u00a0With me here today, don't even think of trying to play tricks! \"\"...\"Before Jian Xingsui could speak, An Ran standing behind Zhou Xun stood up. Looking at it now, the protagonist shou was indeed very handsome and beautiful, with fair skin and nice eyes. He also had a soft breath on his body and he looked really weak as if he needed someone to protect him.An Ran stood in front of Zhou Xun. Although he looked weak, at the moment he was very strong: \"Jian Xingsui, don't hurt Ah Xun. What you are looking for is a fight with me, so just come at me.\"\"...\"Jian Xingsui was now totally speechless.However, Zhou Xun's ears were very moved by An Ran's words. He always knew that An Ran was a kind person, but he never thought that he would be so brave for himself! How cuuuuuuute!!!!!!Zhou Xun pulled An Ran to protect him and sternly said to Jian Xingsui, \"If you dare to touch Ran Ran, I will never let you go.\"But An Ran shook his head. He pulled Zhou Xun's arm and said softly, \"Ah xun, don't do this, I don't want to hurt you.\" (T/N: I'm equally speechless\u00a0......what in the world is happening rn??)1Zhou Xun was even more excited and comforted him by saying, \"Ran Ran, what nonsense are you talking about, and why are you being so polite with me? Don't worry, I won't let anyone bully you in the future.\"Because the voices and movements of these two people were not ''too'' loud, all the people who came to sign up for the audition looked at them. Some even gathered around to watch the fun. Under such circumstances, if Jian Xingsui dared to make trouble, it would definitely be a waste of time. No matter what, An Ran was a very smart person. Standing out in such an environment not only won him a good impression, but he could also easily deal with the cannon fodder.1Sure enough, there were already many people whispering:\"What is happening?\"\"It seems like some kind of bullying incident.\"\"Has that An Ran been bullied?\"2Jian Xingsui listened to the discussions around him and sighed inwardly. He looked at Zhou Xun: \"You two, are you finished?? So now can I speak?\"Zhou Xun was vigilant: \"What are you going to say?\"Jian Xingsui took out his registration documents: \"I'm here to participate in the audition, and I'm here because this is the designated place to wait in line.\"......The surroundings suddenly became silent.Then, someone took the lead in laughing with a \"pu chii bwahahahahahaha\". The group of people who were watching the fun was still pitying An Ran, but now.................. their words of earlier became nothing but a joke. These two shameless people were trying to protect each other......but from whom and from what.......hahahahahahaha!!!Zhou Xun's face also became a little ugly. An Ran behind him was also embarrassed.Jian Xingsui sighed. After putting down the documents, he walked to the chair at the very edge of the corridor and sat down. He looked at the two people and said, \"You guys......whatever!\"An Ran looked at Jian Xingsui hesitantly. He wanted to say something, but Zhou Xun grabbed his arm: \"Let's go, stay away from him.\"The two turned around and walked away as if they went to give Jian Xingsui an indirect slap in his face, but Jian Xingsui was relieved to see that the two were gone. It is best not to contact or have any contact with these people. As long as he is selected, he'll get 20,000 yuan. He will solve his urgent need for money first and then he will not appear in front of the protagonist shou.Just when he was thinking about it, someone came out of the stairwell next to him. She was wearing a mask and had blond hair. The first thing she saw was Jian Xingsui, so she spoke in soft and cute French: \"Hello. Sorry to disturb you.\"Jian Xingsui was stunned for a moment. He didn't expect a French contestant to take part as well.Fortunately, some time ago he had gone to learn some French because Fu Jinxiao had released a French song. He also replied in French, \"Hello.\"\"Ah, that's great.\" The blonde girl narrowed her eyes and smiled, \"I want to ask, where is the main broadcasting room, I couldn't find it.\"The main broadcasting room?Isn't that where only directors and mentors go?Although Jian Xingsui was surprised, he still pointed the way: \"Not here, go forward from here, turn left, and go to the room in that row.\"The blond girl nodded but she still seemed a little confused.Jian Xingsui simply stood up. He raised his hand and gestured, and answered in French: \"Go in this direction, then walk forward about ten meters, there will be a board sign, then turn around and go straight.\"The blonde girl suddenly realized: \"Understood.\"Jian Xingsui smiled: \"You're welcome.\"Just as the blonde girl was about to leave, she was like, \"Oh, what's your name?\"Jian Xingsui reported his name.The blonde girl put her hands together, bowed, and said politely, \"Okay, thank you.\"Jian Xingsui also bowed to say goodbye.He actually didn't know who this girl was just now because he hadn't actually participated in this show in his previous life. But now he sat down for a while and vaguely remembered that there was a foreign female mentor Tuya in the show \"Starlight\" in his previous life. She was also French. He had only watched the first episode of this show at the time, and when Tuya was interviewed, she had named and praised the protagonist shou, saying that he was very kind, and had also pointed the way to her lost self.1Thinking of this, Jian Xing was dumbfounded.Is it possible that the time she lost her way was now??? But isn't this what the protagonist should have done? Why didn't he come to show the way? On second thought, it seemed that An Ran was indeed standing here just now, but because he came, and he and Zhou Xun left because they didn't like him.1That.....................did he just accidentally rob the protagonist's halo?1Jian Xingsui sighed helplessly and recalled the fate of the protagonist and his own in his previous life. He didn't know whether he should laugh or cry. He could only pray that the world consciousness would see it as not intentional for his own sake, and stop blaming the vicious cannon fodder aka him for everything.......On the other side,The director's team received a call.This call was from Jian Zhi, a popular star of recent years. With some power and resources of the Jian family, he had gradually gained some fans and popularity.The reason why Jian Zhi made this call was also very simple. He asked the show team to take care of his younger brother. He just had a phone call with his younger brother not long ago. After learning about the situation, he greeted the show team. He didn't want his younger brother to suffer any grievances. Especially after learning that Jian Xingsui had followed him in a haunted spirit, he was even more worried.Although An Ran said on the phone that Jian Xingsui only came to participate in the audition, listening to An Ran's hesitant tone, Jian Zhi dared to say that things would not be so simple. His baby brother definitely won't report and complain about small things. In fact, he will definitely be bullied by Jian Xingsui. Now that he has returned to Jian's house, of course, he will not sit idly by.The program team replied, \"Don't worry, we will definitely take care of him. We see An Ran's condition is also very good, and it will be no problem for him to pass the audition.\"\"Yeah.\" Jian Zhi said, \"I'm relieved that you guys have good eyes, but be careful not to let people who are arrogant come in. I looked at your list, and there is one person I don't think is suitable................\" (T/N: FUCK YOU!!!!! This Jian Zhi is a real pain in assss!!!)The purpose of this call was full of meanings and intentions. It was obvious that he wanted that particular someone to never be selected.After hanging up the phone, the assistant director sighed and discussed with the director next to him, but the director didn't respond too much after hearing it: \"Fenghuang Entertainment, where Jian Zhi works, also has sent a lot of trainees this time.\u00a0For his sake, it doesn't matter if someone is eliminated in the audition. Just remember who to eliminate, don't make a mistake. \"The assistant director responded.It seems that this man named Jian Xingsui can't blame others, he can only blame himself for offending that thug Jian Zhi.2......On the other side - --Inside the studio,\"Okay, Cut! Everyone take a rest.\"With that order of the director, the person who was originally filming on the stage walked down. Fu Jinxiao was wearing high-end summer fashion clothing. The man under the light was handsome and threatening. He truly looked like a noble and elegant prince who came out of the castle.The staffs were very enthusiastic along the way:\"Brother Fu has worked hard.\"\"Brother Fu, would you like some water?\"\"Hello, Brother Fu.\"Fu Jinxiao nodded lightly, with a polite smile on his face, which made many staff members blush unconsciously when they looked at that face.Until he returned to the dressing room, the man sat down lazily, his smile faded, and under the gold-rimmed glasses were a pair of indifferent and deep eyes. He took the water handed over by his assistant and looked at his agent: \"Is there something?\"Wang Meican said: \"'Starlight' has sent a stack of materials related to the contestants for this audition. They knew that you would not go to the scene, so they sent all the materials to you, and gave us a few places that can be designated for selection.\"Fu Jinxiao was not interested: \"You can just pick two.\"Wang Meican knew this was the case. She put the materials on the table and looked at it casually: \"Then let's choose people from our own company first.\"Fu Jinxiao responded lightly.He was really not interested. When he put the water glass back, he was just glancing casually but saw a familiar face and photo on a piece of information paper.Wang Meican was about to filter the data, and when she saw him staring at that picture, she asked, \"What's wrong?\"Fu Jinxiao stretched out his hand to pick up the information paper. He pinched the paper with his slender and fair fingers, and his eyes fell on the photo of the boy with a stubborn face. - Jian Xingsui.It was the child of the rice cake shop who was desperately trying to protect him from his anti-fans.Last time he(JXS) had taken his(FJX) band-aid and had said he would thank himself next time they meet.Wang Meican asked suspiciously, \"What's the matter, do you know him?\"\"Don't know.\"Fu Jinxiao responded and he glanced at the profile below again. When he saw that Jian Xingsui's ''favorite idol'' column was filled in as none but his ''favorite works'' criteria were filled with all of his early songs,\u00a0a meaningful smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.1Wang Meican was about to breathe a sigh of relief: \"I thought you knew each other, after all, the young people in the entertainment industry are all excited when they find out that you might be a mentor, and many want to use you for some popularity, you ...\"Fu Jinxiao put that information sheet in front of Wang Meican: \"Just him.\"Wang Meican was taken aback: \"What?\"\"Notify the program team.\" Fu Jinxiao's voice was lazy, but he couldn't help saying: \"He is my personal selection.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

HEHE.............................Jian Xingsui, who was outside, didn't know that he had somehow put the directors in a very difficult situation.After answering the phone, the assistant director slumped on the chair, looking a little helpless.The director still didn't know the seriousness of the matter and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\"Do you remember Jian Xingsui, who was not allowed to be selected because of the call from a Jian family member before?\" the assistant director said.The director was still drinking milk tea and nodded, \"Yeah I remember, what's wrong?\"The assistant director took a deep breath: \"Just now, Brother Fu's agent called and said that the contestant they had chosen is Jian Xingsui!\"2\"Cough...cough cough!\"The director froze while he was still drinking the milk tea. He, an honest and hardworking director almost choked to death. He kept coughing and his face had become red all over before he finally recovered. He looked at the assistant director in disbelief: \"What did you say?!\"The assistant director showed the call record to the director.Director Da Xiazhi actually broke out in a cold sweat. He wiped it but his hands were still shaking: \"Go and bring me the information card of Jian Xingsui. I'll take a look. Who is that little ancestor making us live a donkey's life?\"3If it was just the call from the Jian family member, they wouldn't really care, but if it was from Fu Jinxiao, everyone would just stand up.Fu Jinxiao, a well-recognized bigshot in the industry, was an artist with almost zero negative reviews. There was almost no one in the industry who wanted not to cooperate with him. This man was dedicated and was unpretentious too. He also had the excellent business ability. Moreover, he was an absolute powerful actor.1It was precisely because of his wide and well-known reputation that many new freshers and girls were rushing to cling to Mr. Fu. For that, many of them had circled the entertainment circle several times, but no one had ever succeeded, nor had Mr. Fu given a little face to anyone.\u00a0And at this moment, this Jian Xingsui popped out of nowhere which made the two honest and hardworking directors really curious!2The assistant director took out the information card and murmured, \"What kind of small broken agency he signed with, 'Bankrupt Entertainment'? This company's name is really funny.\"1The director also smiled: \"As amazing as he is.\"The two were in a dilemma. They couldn't afford to offend the Film emperor Fu but then again they had already agreed with that asshole Jian Zhi. Now they were in a huge dilemma!1Just as they were worried, someone pushed open the door and walked in. The blonde French instructor came in and took off her mask. She breathed a sigh of relief: \"I finally found this place, Thank God.\"\"Tuya!\" The director smiled when he saw the female mentor they had brought in with great difficulty: \"I just heard from your agent that you are easy to get lost. We were quite worried, and we were about to send someone to pick you up.\"Tuya looked very sweet and cute, she said with a smile: \"I did get lost. It was a Chinese contestant who helped me guide the way. His French is very good, and he is a good person. I think he will be a good competitor. I am extremely looking forward to his performance in the audition.\"2The director was surprised. He didn't expect a contestant to get into her eyes, so he asked, \"Then we will definitely select him. The person you like will definitely not be bad. What's his name?\"\"He's called...\" Tuya frowned. She thought for a while, and then her eyes lit up: \"Jian Xingsui.\"......The room was quiet for a moment.2Tuya looked at the director and assistant director suspiciously: \"What happened to you guys?\"The director and the assistant director looked at each other and smiled wryly.What happened with them????? hehe Nothing much............. they just suddenly felt that they didn't want to live anymore.1Jian Xingsui outside did not know the dire situation of the director group for the time being. When the audition started slowly, many contestants showed their talents in it, and there were also all-rounder talents who were good at both singing and dancing. The scene was very welcoming and lively. An Ran was in front of Jian Xingsui.\u00a0He went in and danced a piece of his own original dance, which was also appreciated.This original dance had his own ideas. It combined modern dance and hip-hop dance. An Ran had learned dance since childhood, and the flexibility of his body was excellent in all aspects. It also impressed the directors and the protagonist's halo was vividly displayed .1Soon after he came out, it was Jian Xingsui's turn.After stepping into the inner hall, there were quite a few people sitting inside. The director and others were sitting in the front row. Jian Xingsui didn't know if it was his own illusion but as soon as he came in, the directors looked at him with a little bit of...anxiety?1Jian Xingsui bowed properly: \"Hello, mentors, hello director, I'm Jian Xingsui, and the talent I have is singing.\"He casually sang a song, which was quite satisfactory.Although it was not excellent, his voice was not bad. Besides, there was one thing that made the director satisfied.\u00a0After being used to seeing the various handsome hairstyles of the little freshers, Jian Xingsui's buzz-cut style was very... surprising.It was like, a gentle and delicate scholar suddenly came to chop wood. This kind of more distinctive style was actually what the program team would give priority to and want.Although his talent was a little mediocre, if it was before, maybe such a contestant would not have been noticed by the director and the program team, but he was specially named by two big bosses, and now even Tuya had mentioned his name which had to let the director team pay attention.The director said: \"If you join our program, do you have any requirements for us, such as what you want for the series of support our program team provides you after you come in?\"Jian Xingsui thought for a while. His expression was very serious.Just when the director felt that person who was greeted by two big bosses at the same time would definitely be hard to serve, maybe Jian Xingsui would say that he wanted more tv shots, or wanted some professional teacher training, the teenager standing off the stage raised his head and asked softly, \"Well, I just wanted to ask, once I will pass the audition and participate in the first phase of the program, will I really get 20,000 yuan?\"\"...\"The room fell into silence.1The director felt that he had never been so speechless in his entire life. Who was this lad kidding with?The person who was mentioned by the two bosses at the same time, came here just for 20,000 yuan?1Little lad, please forgive this old, honest, and hardworking director I promise you I'll personally give you 20,000 yuan right now even with bonuses. In return please ask your bosses to let me go! The director's heart was roaring in a very complicated way.3The assistant director also nodded tearfully, \"Yes.\"Jian Xingsui bowed: \"Thank you, then I have nothing to ask. By the way, will you guys also cover my food and living expenses?\"Assistant Director: \"........I'LL COVER.\"Jian Xingsui smiled directly: \"That's great.\"The hearts of the two directors were even more complicated now. But when they thought about it, if they will select this kind of ummm......very simple-minded person, then it will definitely be fine. Besides, they will also be able to have a good relationship with the film emperor Fu!The director smiled and said, \"Very good, you have been accepted, go back and wait for the notice.\"Jian Xingsui was stunned for a moment. He hadn't expected it to be so simple.But he still bowed and was about to go forward to get the registration form. Just as he was holding the form and was about to fill in, a backstage staff came from behind, walked up to the director, and said, \"Director, that little Wang who is in charge of running errands, he just asked for leave for some business at home. What should I do if he will not come in the next two days?\"The director was also very worried: \"Why is everyone making me feel so bad at this exact time ne??? It's not even easy to recruit people, you guys really...\"Just when he was worried, Jian Xingsui, who was always ready to give him some heart attacks held the form and suddenly said, \"Director, are you short of temporary workers?\"The director was taken aback and looked at him in surprise.After all, the families who can come to the audition and want to debut are usually at least from middle-class families. However, he couldn't directly ask this fellow whether he was really broke or rich as fuck. But he still nodded: \"Yes, what's wrong?\"Jian Xingsui said, \"Don't I look perfect for that job?\"3\"...\"The director felt that he was being dominated by this person all day, so he said, \"Yes, yes, yes but ...........the salary is only 150 per day.\"Jian Xingsui nodded without hesitation: \"Yes.\"Honest and hard-working director:The director's mood suddenly became complicated. He saw that Jian Xingsui's hands were white and tender. He didn't look like that kind of child from a poor family, and there were two big bosses who had personally called out his name.\u00a0Although one of them wanted to fuck his career, he couldn't help but ask, \"Are you short of money?\"Jian Xingsui nodded: \"Yes.\"The feelings of the director and the assistant director at the moment were even more indescribable.All in all, it was the kind of complexity that said: you damn kid finally caught our attention!However, no matter how complicated it was, Jian Xingsui still got the job. He didn't plan to go back to the rice cake shop. So now he had to find a job by himself. Brother Wang had agreed to let him live in the staff dormitory of the Bankrupt Entertainment.\u00a0So if he took a temporary job here, he could solve the problem of food and clothing, and although the errand work was a little tiring, it was simple, so he could get started quickly.......A few days later,Downstairs in the entertainment building, when Jian Xingsui was in the parking lot at the bottom of the building to help the security uncle check some special guests and vehicles that the program team might invite in the near future, a group of girls suddenly gathered slowly not far away. They were holding light signs in their hands that were supposed to be the items to support their idols.Jian Xingsui asked the security guard, \"They are...\"\"Oh, today the film emperor Fu may come to check the process with the director team.\" Security uncle took a look at the group of fans: \"Most of them are die-hard fan sisters or some spoiled children who have discovered the film emperor's itinerary in advance.\"Jian Xingsui's hand holding the paper stopped and clenched unconsciously.The security guard said to him, \"Are you also a fan of the film emperor Fu?\"\"I...\" Jian Xingsui's head was lowered, making it difficult to see his expression. He shook his head slowly: \"I'm not.\"The security uncle did not ask any further questions.Jian Xingsui's heart began to tense unconsciously. Just when he was about to go back after finishing the list, a nanny car drove in not far away. Before Jian Xingsui could react, the group of girls was already excited. Some people screamed some cheered, and when the nanny car stopped, many people gathered around.However, the one who got out of the car was another female artist who was going to record the show. After the assistant cleared the stage, a group of fans of the film emperor Fu who had been surrounding them waited for a while. Then they found that film emperor Fu really would not come today. Gradually, people left.\u00a0When they left, some people's light signs and signboards with small standing statues were scattered on the ground and were not taken away. Jian Xingsui waited for everyone to finish before walking forward and squatting on the spot. He stepped down and picked up the small standing sign that was abandoned on the ground.......At this moment, on the other side, another nanny car drove in.After stopping at the fixed position, the staff responsible for the response of the program team eagerly came over and said, \"Brother Fu, you can avoid people by taking the internal elevator with us here.\"The man who got out of the car was wearing casual punk clothes. The man was tall and had black sunglasses on his handsome face. Fu Jinxiao took off the sunglasses with one hand nodded and said, \"Let's go.\"When a group of people walked to the elevator, they passed by the place where the fans were squatting.Fu Jinxiao turned his face away and glanced nonchalantly, but saw a boy standing there. He was bending down to pick up the scattered signs on the ground carefully. He carefully wiped that board with so much serious look, as if picking up some treasure.2Fu Jinxiao inexplicably took two more glances.The staff followed his gaze and smiled, \"That's a temporary worker we invited to clean up the site.\"Fu Jinxiao responded lightly. For some reason, the back of that figure made him feel inexplicably familiar, so he asked casually, \"What's his name?\"\"Oh.\" The staff thought for a while and replied, \"He seems to be called Jian Xingsui!\"2\"...\"The movie emperor, who had never cared about anything, raised his eyebrows in interest very rarely.After a while, he chuckled softly................................................................................................The author has something to say:Fu Jinxiao: Just how many surprises are you going to give me, boy.....Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you!.........................................................................................................................................................Jian Xingsui didn't know about Fu Jinxiao's visit.His part-time job was ending this afternoon. When he went to collect his salary later, Xiaomi, a backstage staff member with whom he had often worked together, was still reluctant to part with him: \"Sui Sui, are you really leaving? Once you'll leave......\"Jian Xingsui was expressionless: \"Once I'll leave, I will see you again in a few days.\"Xiaomi couldn't take it anymore, so he laughed.That's right, in the days when he no longer continues to be a temporary worker, Jian Xingsui has to seriously start preparing for the first round of \"Starlight\" recording.\u00a0Although he was only going to participate in one episode, he had to come up with some preparations. Firstly because he had to be responsible for the program, and the other was because..... the tutor was Fu Jinxiao.\u00a0Of course, he knew that he couldn't have any stories with that person. The cannon fodder was destined to be cannon fodder, but he didn't want to lose face in front of his idol, so he had to prepare well.Bro Wang, the agent, said, \"I heard that these days even though the program hasn't even been recorded yet but those big companies have all gone to talk about their trainee's debut positions. There are even a few trainees whose positions have already been determined.\"Jian Xingsui said, \"Well, it's normal.\"Brother Wang sighed and said, \"However, the talent shows in recent years have not been getting massive responses because of them being sluggish. So this time the director team is going to introduce something big.\u00a0They want to do live broadcasts and do the first batch of talent variety show to bring a different look and feel to the audience.''Jian Xingsui was a little surprised: \"Is it really gonna be a live broadcast?\"In the original novel, it was obviously recorded first and then broadcasted. Why did it suddenly change?2Is it possible that this was also caused because of the butterfly effect? Jian Xingsui couldn't figure it out, but then he thought that he would definitely be eliminated in the first phase. It didn't matter much. So he didn't take it too seriously.One day before the official recording of the show, all the contestants had received an electromagnetic card. That was an identification card, which could be used to enter the recording venue.\u00a0This card could still be used in the dormitory after that and it could also be used to collect things. The program team might have made this card to make it look a bit more distinctive, so it was quite large. It was hard for it to fit in the usual-sized pockets.Jian Xingsui received a notice from the program team that they were letting them familiarize themselves with the venue the day before the recording.In other words, all the contestants had to meet one day in advance. It was not a difficult task. Jian Xingsui thought that he could meet anyone except An Ran. Because it was too early, he decided to go to the bathroom first.\u00a0When he approached, someone was already there while talking on the phone. That person was totally complaining: \"What kind of show group is this? Why is the card issued to me so big? I have no pockets in my clothes, and it's even hard to go to the toilet.\"The tone of the speaker was very arrogant and willful.Jian Xingsui had just paused when the person just came over after making the phone call. It was a boy with a spiky head who was wearing a black leather suit with rivets. He looked cool and nasty in that outfit but such a non-mainstream outfit was very expensive.2Jian Xingsui knew the logo of that pair of shoes that the boy was wearing. He used to be the young master of the Jian family. Of course, he knew about these things. This brand was only for super VIP customers. All the clothes on his body were customized. The price of that set of clothes must have exceeded 8 digits.\"Hello\" Shen Xingchen waved at him: \"Come here.\" (T/N: AHHHHHH!!!! My dear Shen Xingchen!!!)3Jian Xingsui pointed to himself suspiciously: \"Did you call me?\"Shen Xingchen nodded angrily: \"Who else is here besides you. Come and help me hold this card. I'll come back after going to the toilet? Did you understand?\"Jian Xingsui took the card: \"Yes.\"Shen Xingchen waved his hand: \"Thank you, buddy.\"After he entered, Jian Xingsui stood by the railing and waited. Who would have guessed that someone would run over after some time while still panting? As soon as he turned his head, he saw a familiar face, An Ran!1An Ran was very anxious as if he had lost something. He was stunned when he saw Jian Xingsui and he said, \"It's you...\"Jian Xingsui said, \"Yes.\"\"Well, have you seen my ID card?\" An Ran asked him.Jian Xingsui shook his head: \"No.\"An Ran was about to leave, but when he saw that Jian Xingsui had two cards in his hand. He hesitated, \"Then whose card is that in your hand?\"Jian Xingsui said, \"It's not yours, it's someone else's.\"An Ran remembered that this time Jian Xingsui had no team and he was the only trainee, so how could he have two cards in his hand? He had passed through this corridor to go to the toilet when he had come here, and Jian Xingsui happened to be standing here, so it was very likely that what he picked up was his own!Immediately, he hesitated and didn't move any further.2Zhou Xun, who had followed him, also came over. As soon as he came over, he saw An Ran and Jian Xingsui confronting each other, and quickly stepped over: \"Ran Ran, what's the matter?\"Seeing his friend coming, An Ran said softly, \"It's nothing. Ah xun, I'm still looking for my card.\"Zhou Xun saw that Jian Xingsui next to him was holding two, and immediately said, \"Jian Xingsui, have you got Ran Ran's card?\"?Jian Xingsui widened his eyes in surprise, feeling unbelievable.Did he have ''a vicious cannon fodder'' written on his face? He could look bad even while just standing?This time, An Ran had come with a boy group, not only with Zhou Xun, but also with two other teammates. They also hurried over. Seeing their posture, they hurried over to ask what had happened.Who knew that Zhou Xun would point at Jian Xingsui: \"This is the Jian Xingsui I told you about.\"The other people looked over with vicious eyes.Zhou Xun said, \"Jian Xingsui, I told you not to bully Ran Ran. Are you still not giving him his belonging?\"2Because the electromagnetic card was electromagnetic, the name of the contestant was not directly written. There was only a logo of the program group on it, so from the surface, it was not clear whose card was it.The other two boys looked at An Ran and said, \"Ran Ran, is it true?\"An Ran was a little hesitant. He wasn't sure, but he felt that Jian Xingsui had always made things difficult for him. If he had really found his card this time, he might have deliberately said it was someone else's card.\u00a0So because Jian Xingsui had already said no, he had to be forced to find out the truth. He didn't immediately explain, but looked at Jian Xingsui weakly and said softly, \"This card is very important to me, can you give it to me?\"......Jian Xingsui frowned, and he said, \"It's not yours, why should I give it to you.\"The other people standing beside him were not happy when they heard his words.They knew that An Ran's character could not be slandered casually, and Zhou Xun had told them about Jian Xingsui's previous deeds.\u00a0Looking at Jian Xingsui's eyes, their eyes turned bad, and when they were about to fight for justice, a voice came from the toilet: \"Why are you all blocked here?\"2Dressed in black, Shen Xingchen came out of the toilet, and he looked at everyone suspiciously.Although Jian Xingsui hadn't recognized him at first glance, Zhou Xun did. There was no one in the rich second-generation circle who didn't know about Shen Xingchen. This person was not considered a rich second-generation because the family he belonged to, the Shen family, had always been a wealthy family since the centuries. There were only two top-tier giants in the city, one was the Fu family, the other one was the Shen family.\u00a0And the young man in front of him was the second son of the Shen family, Shen Xingchen.1Anyone who knew him knew that Shen Xingchen had a thorny temper and was not easy to mess with.Just before, Zhou Xun was acting very arrogant and now once he saw Shen Xingchen, he felt weak again. He said, \"Mr. Shen, we are helping our teammate get his name card back.\"Shen Xingchen was puzzled: \"Where are you going to find it?\"Zhou Xun pointed to the name card in Jian Xingsui's hand.Shen Xingchen followed his gaze and saw his name card in Jian Xingsui's hand. He sneered, glared at Zhou Xun, and finally kicked the ass out of him \"Are you fucking trying to get on my nerves? That's my card, what the fuck?\"5......The surrounding air suddenly fell into silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe atmosphere at the scene could almost be described as - Everyone felt second-hand embarrassment for Zhou Xun.Zhou Xun looked at Jian Xingsui in disbelief, and then he looked at An Ran again. In fact, he was kicked for no reason and he really wanted to get angry, especially when he was embarrassed in front of his sweetheart so much that he wanted to die. But if he was asked to hit Shen Xingchen.........he wouldn't dare.1After all, the Zhou family had to admit that he was just a nouveau riche, but the Shen family's family background was really strong, and he didn't want to establish such a terrible enemy on the first day.After Shen Xingchen kicked the person, he took out a name card: \"I just saw a name card by the sink, who lost it?\"An Ran's eyes lit up next to him. He stretched out his hand. It was a fair and beautiful little hand. He looked at Shen Xingchen pitifully, \"I lost it.\" (T/N: Here we go again)If there was no such thing as the guy in middle aka Zhou Xun, the beautiful little guy who lost the card, and the handsome guy who picked it up, it would have been a beautiful encounter, but with that bastard in the middle, the surroundings background had changed completely.Shen Xingchen sighed and handed the card to An Ran, \"Is this the card you lost?\"An Ran nodded softly after taking it.\"Then shouldn't you have gone inside to find it, what the fuck you were doing being noisy outside?\" Shen Xingchen didn't understand: \"Wannabe gangsters even wanted to rob my card. Humph!!!!\"Shen Xingchen's aura was so strong that An Ran's eyes were red because of shame: \"I... I didn't mean to.\"Seeing his sweetheart being bullied like this, Zhou Xun couldn't help it. He said, \"Young Master Shen, you can't blame Ran Ran for this, in fact, you don't know the person next to him, he has a big problem with his character.\u00a0He had bullied Ran Ran before, so we accidentally made a mistake. \"Jian Xingsui never thought that he could always get attention just by standing in the silent corner. Of course, the attention he got was always for no good reason.But he also sighed a little in his heart. It could be said that the young master Shen in front of him will not defend himself after listening to Zhou Xun's words. After all, who would have a good opinion of a cannon fodder?However, Shen Xingchen glanced suspiciously at Jian Xingsui for a few times, then sneered: \"Do you guys take Lao Zi( arrogant way to say I) as a blind or what? As soon as I came out, I saw a group of you wannabe gangsters gathered around asking for someone else's card. Who are you saying bullied you? And again, If I hadn't come out, my card would have been gone!\"Zhou Xun choked, not knowing what to say.But An Ran pulled his arm and said softly, \"Forget it, Ah Xun. Young Master Shen, I'm sorry, it's our fault, don't take it to heart.\"Shen Xingchen doesn't know why, but he actually likes pretty boys. If it wasn't for this, he might have felt very good when he encountered such a pretty boy. He would have appreciated it and even would have thought of protecting him, but now........... he was in a bad mood. He even thought of how this stupid guy crying to act pitiful was such an ass. What an annoying ass. Should he kick this fucker as well??: \"Why are you apologizing to me, if you really want to apologize, you should apologize to him.2An Ran looked at Jian Xingsui. He had always been the one who was apologized. He had never imagined that one day he would apologize to Jian Xingsui. At this moment, his eyes were red, as if he had been wronged. He whispered: \"I'm sorry.\"Jian Xingsui's scalp was numb: \"It's alright, you can go quickly.\"The protagonist shou's apology almost took his little life again ah. If the world consciousness wouldn't like him, what should he do if around this time in next year he will have a one-year death anniversary ah?\u00a0In the eyes of Zhou Xun's group of people, his attitude was like that of a dog, who was looking down on others.\u00a0Immediately, others looked down on Jian Xingsui and cast unkind glances, and only then did they support An Ran, who was obviously ''injured'', and left.After Shen Xingchen saw that they were gone, he turned his attention to Jian Xingsui again: \"You...\"Jian Xingsui was a little afraid of him: \"Well, I'm leaving too, farewell.\"\"Come back!\" Shen Xingchen pulled him, puzzled: \"What are you running for, I haven't finished talking yet!\"Jian Xingsui was stiff: \"What do you want to say?\"Shen Xingchen raised his eyebrows: \"Do those people have a grudge against you?\"\".......One can't really say that.....\"\"Just tell me whether there's any?\"\"......Maybe a little.\"\"I knew it!\" Shen Xingchen was like a mentally ill young man:\u00a0\"I found about that just the moment I came out. They obviously don't like you. So they are trying to find fault in you.\u00a0Young Master hates this kind of people who bully less powerful ones using their family power the most!!!! \"Jian Xingsui found out that this young master Shen had a really strong sense of justice and loved to protect the weak.\u00a0Sure enough, in fact, a truly kind-hearted person doesn't necessarily have to look docile.\u00a0It's possible that this spiky head in a leather jacket was exactly this kind of person.\"Thank you so much.\" Jian Xingsui said with a little sincerity, \"If it wasn't for you, I might not have been able to explain it.\"Shen Xingchen was praised. The young man was full of happy bubbles in his head. He wanted to be proud but he was afraid of damaging his image, so he pretended to be profound: \"What's so good about this. Those fucking annoying people, I really can't stand them.\u00a0You are also here to participate in the show, right? I also did it because you helped me hold my name card. Don't worry, if they will again come to fight you in the future, just mention my name. \"Jian Xingsui thought he was so cute.1But in any case, today's incident can be regarded as a wake-up call for Jian Xingsui. He found out that his vicious cannon fodder physique was 100% triggering the halo of the protagonist by coincidentally encountering these things again and again. So he can't stay in this show for much longer. When the first episode will be recorded in two days, he will have to deal with everything quickly and then immediately run away. So he really thought mentioning Shen Xingchen was not really necessary.But Jian Xingsui was still very grateful for his kindness, so he sincerely appreciated it: \"Thank you.\"......The next dayThe show officially started recording, and 108 contestants gathered outside the square.The director group did not show up, only a group of photographers showed up. The positions of these contestants were also very particular.\u00a0Those from a slightly larger company, those who have already debuted in the circle, and those who have the slightly better family background were all standing in the front. They were getting more shots, and some amateurs and those without any backers were standing in the back.At the same time, the homepages of major live broadcast apps also began to recommend, live broadcast, and a large number of viewers poured in:\"I came here at exact time!\"\"Brother Fu, Brother Fu! I'm here for Brother Fu!\"\"Ah, I can finally see my brother!\"Even if he was just a program mentor, Fu Jinxiao's popularity was huge. Just his name had brought the entire program group's popularity to the top.At the recording site, someone held a loudspeaker and said in front: \"Everyone let's greet each other now. Please be ready to enter our \"Starlight\" variety show's camp with me. On the first day of the camp, please choose your own dormitory.\"A contestant asked, \"Do we really choose the dormitory by ourselves?\"The staff nodded: \"Of course!\"After the order was given, all the contestants were ready to go and rushed to find the room collectively.\u00a0Everyone knew that if you grab the dormitory early, you can grab a good spot earlier, so many contestants rushed directly when they heard the sound of the horn.Of course, there were exceptions.That was Jian Xingsui, who was wandering in the back. He didn't want to join the other contestants in running, because he didn't care. He could live anywhere.\u00a0Anyway, it is estimated that after sleeping for two days, he will be eliminated and go back.The camera swayed in front, and the audience began to observe the contestants:\"This looks good.\"\"This trainee is okay too.\"\"Am I blind? Why do I feel like they all look alike.\"When the audience began to see the fun play, a figure gradually entered everyone's sight.\u00a0That was none other than Jian Xingsui, who was swaying in the back. He didn't steal the camera's shots. He didn't even look at the photographer.\u00a0He was also not like other contestants who deliberately exaggerated the tone for the sake of the camera and the audience, doing handsome moves running here and there. While others were running to find a good room in groups of four or five, he with his buzz-cut, which made him look different from other trainees, had a dull expression. Others were ready to rob and conquer rooms on the battlefield while he was walking like an old man.The audience was delighted:\"Who is this?\"\"Why are you so leisurely, are you sure you came to compete in the competition?\"\"oh my boy, did you accidentally go to the wrong place?\"So it was supposed to be the first meeting for the newcomers. Many people tried their best to leave the best impression, but Jian Xingsui, who was slow behind, came into the eyes of the public.The dormitory choosing competition might seem illogical, but in fact, there were inherent unspoken rules. People from big companies and powerful family backgrounds naturally lived together. Some of them even had their position pre-determined.\u00a0Naturally, they were also the object that many people wanted to please. All the other ordinary trainees all give priority to making friends with such people.When it was Jian Xingsui's turn, most of the dormitories were already full. The kind photographer reminded him, \"There still is a place left in the room in the front.\"Jian Xingsui said, \"Thank you.\"According to his guess, there was still a place left in the dormitory, then it must be that the trainees inside were really amateur like himself not that charming and famous.\u00a0However, when he really officially walked to the door of the dormitory, before he stepped in, he heard a familiar arrogant voice: \"What's going on here, has everyone already found their roommates?\u00a0Why are there two beds left here? \"......Hearing this voice, Jian Xingsui had a terrible premonition.But just when he was completely standing at the door, the arrogant spiky head in the room, Shen Xingchen raised his eyebrows with an unexpected expression and smiled, \"It's you!\"Jian Xingsui smiled bitterly: \"It's me.\"\"Did you come here specifically to find me?\" Shen Xingchen didn't realize that everyone else didn't want to live in a dormitory with him because of his bad temper, and grinned: \"I didn't expect you to be very attentive, that's good. For the sake of us being roommates in the future, you will be my little buddy in the future. No matter what happens, I will cover you in the future!\"\"...\"+.........................................................................The author has something to say:I will be your brother from now on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter finally dealing with Shen Xingchen, Jian Xingsui noticed that there were two other people in their dormitory. One had a cute student's head cut and looked very cute and lively, while the other one looked like a very honest and steady kind of person.\u00a0After noticing his searching gaze, the cold one just nodded coldly and said, \"Hello, I'm Ning Ze.\"The cute-looking guy also headed over to greet him warmly: \"Hello, I'm Wen Shengge.\"Jian Xingsui also reached out to greet them: \"Hello, I'm Jian Xingsui.\"The three people in the dormitory got along quite harmoniously.\u00a0Only Shen Xingchen, who was next to him, looked like the emperor. He walked directly to a bed and sat down, swaggering: \"I'll sleep here if you don't want to sleep.\"\"...\"It's not that the others didn't want to sleep, they just had not finished choosing the bed yet.Before, only Jian Xingsui knew how domineering and outrageous this young master was.\u00a0But the other two also saw it at this moment. Wen Shengge on the other hand also chose another bed as if he had already thought of it long ago.\u00a0Ning Ze never liked to talk, so he chose another one by himself. Anything such as quarrel for the bed was not seen in this dormitory.After all the contestants finished choosing the dormitory, the staff said, \"Please pack up and go to the recording site!\"Although Jian Xingsui was the last one to choose his bed, trainees in other dormitories were still trying to choose the beds and introducing each other. Everyone in the Jian Xingsui's dormitory had basically already finished doing everything including their self-introductions. So they were the first in the groups to arrive at the recording site.\u00a0The program team's recording venue this time was very well thought of. The spotlights flickered in the huge venue. Because Jian Xingsui's group was the first to come in, as a result they were naturally noticed by the audience in the live broadcast.\"It's him, it's that little brother.\"\"There's a spiky head in a leather jacket next to that my old dude.\"\"Wow, why do these people look like they came from some underworld organization to collect fees ah.\"\"Hahahaha, I'm dying of laughter.\"Because Shen Xingchen was at the front, followed by Jian Xingsui and Ning Ze, honest and upright people, Shen Xingchen at the front looked very arrogant. He was exuding the aura of a big brother who was taking the younger brothers out in the street. So many viewers were amused. They even remembered their names by accident.Then, most of the contestants entered the venue one by one.Shen Xingchen sat next to Jian Xingsui and looked at the contestants who entered the arena. He could actually recognize which company half of them were from, and at the same time, he whispered to Jian Xingsui:\"I've seen this guy before. He was shopping with a girlfriend two weeks ago, and now he's still saying on stage that he has been single for 20 years.\"\"Did you see that person? Let me tell you secretly. He has a sugar daddy. Nono in fact he has both sugar daddy and sugar mummy.\"\"What is wrong with that fellow's eyes. Do you believe that he definitely had plastic surgery?\"1Jian Xingsui was sitting stiffly as if he was sitting on pins and needles beside him. So he had to explain embarrassingly: \"I believe it.\"Shen Xingchen sneered. His laugh was not small.Among the two of them, Shen Xingchen had signed a contract that required the program team to give special attention to him through the camera. After all, the Shen family had great wealth and fortune. And if they wanted to give Shen Xingchen the camera shots, Jian Xingsui, who was next to him, definitely couldn't be missed because of how close they were sticking together. But these two were continuously saying something that the audience shouldn't listen to. The photographer who was listening to everything they were whispering was very anxious. So he could only keep giving them the shots from the distance, so the audience could always see these two people whispering together but couldn't hear them. As a result, it indeed had a very good effect.\"Mom, what are they talking about?\"\"I'm anxious to death, I want to hear it too.\"\"What are you doing, cameraman, can you please get closer?\"\"Hahahaha, I'm sorry I can't control it,\u00a0I just keep wanting to see them, wondering what the hell they're talking about.\"The two people who had become the focus of every one were still minding their own business. The other contestants were still trying to fight for the camera shots. Shen Xingchen kept complaining like a bastard, and Jian Xingsui kept being his nodding machine.Fortunately, soon, it was time for the mentors to enter the stage.\u00a0The spotlights in front shone, the hot music blared all over the place, the lift platform of the stage rose, and the four mentors of the show appeared together in a fog and cheers.\u00a0Tuya was dancing in the center of the stage wearing a hot little gown.\u00a0Another man dressed in a cool punk style danced with her.\u00a0Next, was the most important focus of the audience. A man in a black tuxedo was sitting next to a beautiful white piano. Fu Jinxiao was playing the piano to accompany the other dancing mentors.The cheers seemed to overturn the roof.After all, these were the people who they could only see on the TV in the past. Especially Fu Jinxiao, he was the backbone of the entertainment industry, and now such a group of big names was just some meters away from them!Not only these people were excited, but Jian Xingsui was also very excited.\u00a0His heart seemed to be about to jump out. He didn't dare to look away from that person on the stage even for a second. Everyone was dazzling, but his eyes could only stay on that tall and straight posture, playing the piano with ease. Even on such a lively and bustling stage, he had a calm aura about him, attracting attention like a truly elegant prince. This really was Fu Jinxiao, his idol and they were really so close.Next to him was Shen Xingchen's babbling voice:\"Sister Tuya's dress today, her manager must have fought with her for this again.\"\"Wow, Brother Shuang's earrings are limited editions. It's really not easy to be a mentor.\"\"Yoyo, Mr. Li danced this dance today, I bet he only practiced for two days, do you believe it?\"Shen Xingchen next to him had always been complaining, especially criticizing everyone. He was not afraid of offending people, so he had always told the truth.\u00a0Everyone else only dared to brag, only he dared to tell the truth, but when it came to Fu Jinxiao, he shut up.Jian Xingsui finally regained his senses, and reluctantly looked away from his idol. He asked, \"How come you won't even say a single thing about Film Emperor Fu let alone complaining?\"Shen Xingchen pouted. This was also the first time that Jian Xingsui looked at the arrogant young master with a somewhat awe-inspiring expression. Shen Xingchen made sure that there wasn't any camera near them then whispered in front of Jian Xingsui: \"Let me advise you!!!! Remember to memorize these words till your death.\"Jian Xingsui: \"What?\"Shen Xingchen looked like he had lingering fears: \"Fu Jinxiao.............. THIS PERSON CAN'T BE PROVOKED.\"Jian Xingsui said, \"AHHHH?\"\"Be sure to keep yourself lowkey in front of him, otherwise you'll wish to be dead than offend this person.\" Shen Xingchen seemed to recall something and complained: \"Don't look at his dog-like appearance, that is very gentle and elegant. If you think he looks polite, then you are surely deceived by him. In fact, he is very dangerous and he's full of evil intentions. Sometimes you won't even know how you had died if you have offended this person...\"The sound of the stage was so loud that Jian Xingsui couldn't hear it clearly: \"What?\"Shen Xingchen glanced at the audience.\u00a0Fu Jinxiao, who seemed to be playing the piano, glanced to their side intentionally or unintentionally.\u00a0The arrogant young man was immediately intimidated by that terrifying look of the film emperor. Shen Xingchen could only shake his head: \"It's nothing, nothing.\"Jian Xingsui was puzzled: \"Ahhh?\"Shen Xingchen didn't know why, but he always felt that the glance that Fu Jinxiao swept at him just now contained a threat. Many people would be fascinated by Film emperor Fu's pair of phoenix eyes, which seemed to be affectionate and gentle. But only a few people who actually knew him knew that those eyes were like the gift from God, which perfectly concealed his coldness and ruthlessness at the bottom of those amorous eyes.Although under the camera, Film Emperor Fu still smiled politely, somehow, Shen Xingchen felt that something was wrong.\u00a0It was as if, even though he was far away and he didn't know what Shen Xingchen was talking about, Fu Jinxiao seemed to be able to guess what Shen Xingchen was muttering to Jian Xingsui was definitely not a good thing.1So, just like a small animal's innate sense of danger, Shen Xingchen always had a hunch that if he really said something bad to Jian Xingsui today, it would be very bad in the future. So Shen Xingchen forcibly changed his words and smiled awkwardly: \"I mean, Brother Fu is really a good person, haha you will know later.\"+.....................................................The author has something to say:Shen Xingchen: \"The biggest wish in my life is to stay away from this dangerous old fox.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10......................................................After Jian Xingsui heard what Shen Xingchen said, of course, he completely believed it.He has been a fan of Fu Jinxiao for a long time. At first, he liked his singing. Later, when he came to know more and more about this person, he was gradually conquered by Film emperor Fu's talent. Then, he slowly got to know that he was in the entertainment industry purely based on his hard work and that quality of him staying serious about things he liked. He was someone who had always stayed loyal to his character.So, Jian Xingsui chuckled lightly. He nodded, and said quite seriously: \"Well, of course, I know that Brother Fu is a very good person.\"Shen Xingchen originally said that casually, but who knew that Jian Xingsui would nod so earnestly in agreement.\u00a0From the moment they met, this young man had always been very low-key and silent. Shen Xingchen thought this guy was a boring-ass, but this time, when he mentioned Fu Jinxiao, his eyes seemed to be shining like a bright star. He had a shallow smile on his face, which made Shen Xingchen feel a little stunned.No way.......this fellow shouldn't be Fu Jinxiao's fan ba???This is a sin to Fu Jinxiao's victims ah...After talking for a while, the performance of the mentors in the opening session was over.\u00a0All the mentors were seated in the jury seat. Fu Jinxiao had deep qualifications and high status in the industry. Of course, he sat in the middle.\u00a0Next to him was Tuya, a French singing and dancing actress, and on their both sides were hip-hop dancers and rappers Liu Shuang and Li Zeming.Li Zeming was a comedian and entertainment actor, but he had experience in forming a group in his early years. This time, half of his responsibility was to act as a host. He said: \"Thank you for coming to \"Starlight\".\u00a0The performance of each of you in the future is related to your destiny. Your mentors will rate your professionalism, and the audience will also vote for your performance.\u00a0There are always a few backstrokes in life. I hope everyone can show and express themselves on their own stage, and don't leave any regrets! \"The venue was very lively and all the contestants applauded.Very soon the first group of people came on stage to perform. The first group was an idol group, but their performance was only quite satisfactory, so no one got an A.This caused quite a stir.It also made many contestants who had not performed yet even more nervous.Wen Shengge, a cute little boy sitting on the other side of Jian Xingsui, said softly, \"This year's tutors might be stricter.\"Jian Xingsui nodded lightly.Only Shen Xingchen sneered after hearing this: \"If you are not capable then you are just not capable. A person with talent will get an A no matter how strict the mentors are.\"\"...\"He really dares to say!After several groups, it was finally the turn of the group Jian Xingsui knew. Mentor Li shouted loudly: \"The next one is Fengxiang Entertainment's TH Dumbo Group!\"It was An Ran's group.As soon as An Ran's group performed, they all had the ability to sing and dance. Especially An Ran, who looked very good-looking, and then sang songs that sounded very nice.The audience was also amazed:\"This little brother looks so cute.\"\"He sings well.\"\"His dancing is also very sassy.\"The mentors were obviously somewhat satisfied. Next came the contestants' self-introductions. After Zhou Xun and the other team members had finished introducing themselves, it was An Ran's turn. He gasped and bowed to everyone: \" Hello mentors, I'm An Ran, I'm 20 years old and I'm studying at the Dance Art Academy in City F...\"Li Zeming asked through the microphone, \"Your instrument playing ability is quite good. How long have you been learning it for.\"\"Well, I've been learning for more than ten years.\" An Ran's eyes slowly turned red when he answered the question: \"I had passed through a piano shop when I was nine years old. At that time, the conditions at home were very difficult, so I could just stand outside and watch others play it inside. When I had free time, I would always listen to it. When I was ten years old, on my birthday, my mother bought it for me...\" (T/N: Here we go again. This......)1The background music of the entire stage had become very gentle and lyrical. The dream-chasing boy with a pure heart, decades of hard work, and effort made him seem to emit light.The audience was also gradually moved:\"This little brother has worked so hard.\"\"Such a sincere contestant... I love him, I want to vote for him.\"\"Is he called An Ran? He looks good and has such good strength!\"Apparently, the mentors were also very moved. Most of the contestants in the seats were also very moved. Jian Xingsui looked at everyone's reaction and his eyes unconsciously fell on Film emperor Fu, who was sitting in the center seat. He didn't have many reactions. He was just leaning against the chair lazily and casually turning the pen in his hand, but he clearly appreciated An Ran's attitude.Jian Xingsui knew that Fu Jinxiao liked hard-working and serious people. This was one of the reasons why the protagonist gong in his previous life was impressed and attracted to the protagonist shou. It is estimated that this life will be no exception.Shen Xingchen, who was next to him, whispered, \"That An Ran, someone in their group was just dancing out of the beat. Just wait, Brother Fu will definitely mention it.\"Under everyone's attention, Film emperor Fu picked up the mic. He had given points to the first few groups without any evaluation. In this group, he picked up the microphone, enough to let everyone know that this group was capable. Most people's attention was attracted, thinking that Film emperor Fu was going to praise An Ran, but nobody had thought that Fu Jinxiao would say, \"Just now, did someone almost fall out of the stage?\"There were five people on the stage, and everyone unconsciously turned their attention to Zhou Xun. This rich boy was not a trainee at all, and he always revolved around An Ran during training. So he hadn't practiced much which led to the error.Jian Xingsui remembered that in the novel and his previous life, Zhou Xun had not participated in the stage performance. An Ran had won unanimous praise for his wonderful performance on his first stage performance, but in this life, he didn't know why suddenly there was another Zhou Xun who should have already been eliminated in the audition. He didn't know what had caused this Zhou Xun to be selected and perform together as a group.Jian Xingsui wondered where the butterfly wings were flapping quietly again.\"It's me.\" Zhou Xun stood up from the queue, he bowed, and then explained awkwardly, \"I was a little nervous at the time, I'm sorry mentor, I was too nervous so...\"Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows slightly, and the corners of his mouth curled slightly: \"I just want to ask you one question, how long have you practiced this dance for?\"It sounded like it didn't carry any lethal power, but it carried inexplicable pressure, which made everyone's heart tighten.An Ran's temperament was kind. Seeing that Zhou Xun was embarrassed, he quickly said, \"I'm sorry, mentor. I'm the captain. Before I came on stage, I didn't counsel my teammates psychologically which made them nervous.\"Zhou Xun immediately said, \"Ran Ran, this has nothing to do with you.\"An Ran shook his head, indicating that he just wanted to take responsibility.In fact, this matter had nothing to do with him. And his this sense of responsibility also impressed many audiences, except... a few mentors sitting in the mentor's seat.Fu Jinxiao's eyes narrowed slightly. Those who knew him knew that this meant that the actor was in a bad mood. He repeated An Ran's words: \"Didn't counsel your teammates psychologically?\"Everyone's heartbeat was raised and they could feel the low pressure in the film emperor's voices.Fu Jinxiao smiled slowly: \"If you are nervous, you can indeed make mistakes. Then aren't you taking those who practice countless times on the stage and spend ten years of hard work as stupids?\"An Ran's words violated his taboo. Hard work and dedication were something he valued the most. And now some ass who clearly hadn't even practiced much to perform on such a huge stage was telling that he made a mistake because he was nervous. Did he take all the professional mentors as stupids?Everyone in the industry knew that Fu Jinxiao was actually a very principled person with a bottom line. He was most interested in the dedication and character of the artist.Sure enough, Zhou Xun's face paled a bit, and he said embarrassingly, \"I indeed practiced for a short time, so I made that mistake. I'm sorry, mentor.\"He finally told the truth.Fu Jinxiao put down the mic. He didn't say anything more, only gave the last sentence: \"I think honesty and frankness not only depicts your respect for me, but also for the audience.\"Great irony! Originally a very lively stage turned to a bit awkward stage because of this.\u00a0The other mentors also supported Fu Jinxiao unconditionally. They also felt that the problem didn't lie in the performer's singing or dancing ability but the attitude of the performer was very important.\u00a0So in the end, the rating for the other teammates was F, and An Ran, who should have gotten the first A, only got a B.Although the director's team originally planned him to give A, on the mentor seat, Film emperor Fu splattered a capital B, and no one dared to talk too much.......After the next two groups, it was Jian Xingsui's turn.The lights on the stage shone, and the host started to read the name of the contestant. Jian Xingsui, who had been waiting, was about to enter the arena. The previous groups also had excellent performances, which were commendable, but the mentors had no obvious interest.\u00a0But surprisingly, when the host started to pronounce Jian Xingsui's name, the atmosphere of the jury's seat suddenly became a little subtle.Fu Jinxiao, who was sitting lazily on a chair and playing with his pen, stopped the pen in his hand. He raised his eyelids and looked at the stage, while Tuya, who was originally lacking in interest, suddenly sat up straight. The two mentors next to them had heard about this contestant who had almost been eliminated because of a big shot. So they couldn't help but gather their energy.The audience also noticed the strange behaviors of the mentors:\"What happened?\"\"Is a bigshot appearing?\"\"Who's Jian Xingsui?\"The lights on the stage shone, and slowly, a boy with a buzz cut in jeans and a white shirt came out.\u00a0Different from other contestants who had colorful and luxurious clothes on, he seemed to have stopped by to participate in a show on his way home to buy vegetables. The only thing that was worth mentioning about him was his\u00a0very fair skin and deep facial features. In front of the camera, because of his clean face, he didn't look greasy but instead looked very refreshing.Jian Xingsui bowed nervously: \"Hello everyone, my name is Jian Xingsui.\"\"...\"The whole place was silent for a moment.Tuya was the first to laugh out loud. She spread her hands: \"And then???\"Jian Xingsui looked at her with some doubts, and then looked at Fu Jinxiao who was calm next to her. Seeing that his idol's eyes fell on him, he said with some anxiety, \"No more.\"egendary 7 words introduction was this???Tuya covered her lips and smiled.The other contestants in general can't wait to use their time of self-introduction to praise themselves and tell their tragic stories. But Jian Xingxui..........he........... did quite well. He just reported his name and FINISH!!!Liu Shuang, a great mentor in the hip-hop world, also held his mic: \"You can tell us about your ideals, or what talents you are good at and introduce yourself to us, or tell us why you came to this stage and whether you have any pursuits. \"Pursuits?Ideals?Jian Xingsui felt like he was going to sweat on his back. He came here to get a job and get 20,000 yuan to move out of the rice cake shop. But if he will tell this reason then he's afraid he will be laughed to death, right?1Then, should he just make up some nonsense?Like saying he was chasing his dreams? Or like ''I love to perform on the stage''?But isn't this a lie? Remembering when the last time film emperor Fu had said with a grim expression that honesty and frankness are the greatest respect for the stage and audience, Jian Xingsui started to panic again. If later the director team will expose himself, then having such a chance to meet his idol in his life, will he still leave an image of a liar in his heart?+He didn't want it!In fact, he could accept being humiliated in front of the protagonist shou. He didn't even want to go against anyone anymore. Moreover, he didn't even want to be remembered by Fu Jinxiao, but the last thing he wanted, was to leave an embarrassing impression in front of his idol.............................................................Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11...........................................................Jian Xingsui stood on the stage. He was a little nervous, so he took a deep breath that made him look a bit hesitant.\"I...the reason why I came to this show...\" Jian Xingsui seemed to be stuck halfway through his speech. He was clearly hesitating but it made everyone even more curious.2Some viewers in the live broadcast room had felt a little bored and sleepy after watching the first few performances, but suddenly a strange person like Jian Xingsui appeared, which attracted everyone's attention:\"I'm so anxious.\"\"What mystery is this brother going to unfold?\"\"Haha, I'm really being anxious to death\"The jury's host, Mr. Li, who was originally engaged in the comedy industry, tried to comfort him and joked: \"It takes so long for you to think about it ah.\u00a0Such a need for hesitation for a single answer??? I suspect that your purpose is not to debut but to go directly to the Oscars. \"The others laughed too.Because everyone normally thinks what purposes the trainees who come here usually can have except for being able to debut and being successful in the entertainment industry?Fu Jinxiao seemed to have seen through Jian Xingsui's hesitation. The film emperor picked up the mic, raised his eyes slightly, and said slowly, \"Just tell the truth.\"Maybe the film emperor himself said this as a comfort to a contestant to let him not be nervous.\u00a0What he didn't know was that in the ears of other contestants, hearing such words was an encouragement, but in Jian Xingsui's ears, it was completely different.[Be honest, tell the truth, have you heard?]The film emperor Fu's coercion lies in the fact that the man doesn't need to make a threatening gesture. Even if it's just a light sentence that he says, it can make you feel panic.It was also these words that made Jian Xingsui finally decide to tell the truth. Under the pressure on his head, he finally decided to give it up. He took a deep breath and said, \"I came here because I heard that you can get 20,000 yuan if you pass the first audition.\u00a0I came here because I was short of money and needed this money for an emergency. \"3\"...\"The whole scene fell into silence.This originally sounded a little outrageous, but for some reason, it was inexplicably funny when it came out of the serious-faced Jian Xingsui's mouth.Teacher Li was the first to be unable to hold back, and he burst out laughing.Tuya wanted to chuckle at first, but she couldn't hold it any longer. The silver bell-like laughter sounded clearly on the stage where the tutors were sitting.\u00a0Only Fu Jinxiao was calmer. The elegant and dignified man didn't have any superfluous expressions on his face. He just glanced at Jian Xingsui lightly, the meaning was unclear.Teacher Li was overjoyed: \"ARE YOU SERIOUS?\"Jian Xingsui nodded resignedly.Teacher Li of course didn't buy it, and asked him, \"Then you really don't have any other purposes? For example, you came here because you love the stage?\"Jian Xingsui smiled bitterly. Since he decided to tell the truth and anticipated the consequences, he bowed deeply and decided to accept everything:\u00a0\"Purposes can only be pursued when living conditions permit. I don't have that condition yet. I've wronged the mentors, and I've wronged the stage.\"When his voice fell, the program crew behind him thought that this was just the right time to pit him.\u00a0The big screen even brought up the surveillance footage of Jian Xingsui when he had come for the audition.On the screen, the director asked him what requirements he had for the program crew. Then Jian Xingsui asked him if they would cover his living and eating expenses. He also asked if the thing about 20,000 yuan was real. Later, one of the program staff had asked for leave.\u00a0He actually asked the program team if they could hire him as the temporary worker. This really showed that he was really short of money and he didn't lie.The three scenes were played in turn, accompanied by funny music, making the audience laugh.Teacher Li smiled and joked: \"While others came here to pursue their dreams, you came here to make money ah!\"The entertainment effect was perfect.But it was unknown why they also felt a little sad. Although Jian Xingsui's reason was very funny, it also made people feel real.\u00a0These days, only qualified people can pursue their ideals and stage. Most people have to continuously struggle even for 20,000 yuan.The audience activity in the live broadcast room had reached the highest level in this period, and the number of comments had also skyrocketed. The screen was full of:\"Brother buzz head, you are so real.\"\"Twenty thousand yuan brother, you are so sincere.\"\"Hahaha, only you are a real worker.\"\"The director was stunned at the time, hahaha\"Everyone was trying to uplift the heavy atmosphere by making jokes.Maybe it was because everyone also had such a difficult time at least once.\u00a0So facing such a sincere young man, they felt relatable.The sweat on Jian Xingsui's forehead at the scene was about to drip, but he couldn't lose face in front of his idol.\u00a0He could only hold on. He looked at the mentor's platform anxiously feeling a bit uneasy. He thought that Fu Jinxiao would look down on him, but the man just turned on the microphone and said in a deep voice, \"What kind of talent did you bring?\"Jian Xingsui replied, \"It's \"Outliers\".This song was a very popular song. Although it was popular, it was very difficult to sing. Very few contestants dare to choose his song on the stage because it was really difficult to control their voice while recording let alone singing on the live broadcast stage.Fu Jinxiao nodded: \"Let's start.\"The mentor spoke and they officially entered the performance time. The stage was quiet, the spotlights flickered, and the background music sounded. Before that, Jian Xingsui on the stage was a little reserved, shy, and looked a little silly, but when the music sounded, the person standing on the stage seemed to suddenly change his aura. It was that kind of aura that was formed because of how serious he looked. His that serious look really made him look too attractive.The soothing and melodious top tune slowly sounded, allowing the originally restless scene to slowly settle down.Jian Xingsui held the microphone. His face was calm and his long eyelashes drooped down. His originally clear voice was now a little deep and slow:\"You appeared too suddenly. I just happened to pass by again.\"\"The opportunity is rare and subjective, but I think it's hard to grab it and I also can't touch it...\"This time in rebirth, he didn't expect that he would come to such an entertainment variety show. At first, he wanted to avoid contact with the Jian family and the protagonist.\u00a0He thought that if he would go to Zhang's house, his life would be much better. After all, he was their ''real son''. He thought he could finally get that warmth from his real parents. He thought as long as his real parents loved and supported him, his life would be meaningful. He thought.......................all of it was only his own thought. The actual fact was that no matter what he did, he couldn't be accepted by others. Knowing his reality, he wanted to leave the city. He was penniless, so he wanted the 20,000 yuan through this variety show but he had never expected to actually get the opportunity to see his idol.In fact, it was not just now but since long long ago that he was unlikable.Although he used to be the young master of the Jian family, it seemed that many people were being nice to him, but in private, these people had completely different opinions about him:\"Jian Xingsui is also a second-generation rich man.\"\"If he didn't have that money, do you think I would have hung out with him?\"\"Hahahaha, do you remember the last time he looked like a fool!\"Friends, he indeed had many of them, but then again what friends would hang out with their friend for money. What friends would always badmouth their friend once he wasn't present? What friends wouldn't try to understand him but instead lead him to the dark abyss? He hated the hypocrisy of these people. But again, he was also afraid of being disliked and abandoned by everyone. He didn't want to be alone. ALONE, this word was too terrifying for him because during the countless nights, at the place where no one knew, he had cried countless times ALONE. At that time, it was difficult for him to even face himself. In junior high school, during his dark times, he heard Fu Jinxiao's song by chance. That song brought him strength and gave him a little comfort.The background music on the stage was still playing. He sang in a low voice: \"You brought my happiness and made life a little more colorful. The treasure like you, however, was destined to be held by someone else. Are you mine...\"Others told him that he was a scumbag, living a rich life, and having whatever he wanted. Only he himself knew that under the lively appearance he always pretended to have in order to not affect people who cared for him, there was a fragile and lonely heart that nobody wanted to understand and care for. He didn't want to accept the fact that the people he thought would care for him were the ones who wanted him to disappear. Amidst this, he chose to believe in only one person.\u00a0What is the power of believing in an idol? Perhaps it was because of the strength and independence of the other party, which made himself yearn for him and gave birth to a positive force. He was a star, but the light he emitted was, unfortunately not aimed at himself.\"I was unable to ask for you, who never seemed to have been made for me. My existence in the world doesn't matter anymore...\"On the stage, the voice of the boy singing in a low voice was low and gentle. His singing voice did not have such mature skills but sounded very emotional. When he sang, his low voice could easily bring people's feelings into it. After the first half of the song, the tone of the music began to rise, Jian Xingsui's eyelashes trembled slightly. He finally raised his head. His eyes met with that person sitting on the jury. It looked like he was singing to the audience, but again it also looked like he was singing to someone.\u00a0The intense emotion contained in his high pitches numbed the scalp and shook the soul of the people presented there.\"You occupied my happiness. This world which doesn't want to have anything to do with me is colorless without you.\"It seemed like he was singing but also expressing emotions:\"Anyway, my existence in the world was made fun of, anyway, my hidden personality is yours...\"When he started to sing, the whole place was very quiet. Such a strong emotional mobilization was very rare.\u00a0When the music entered the climax, the extremely strong sad tone was sung loudly, which made one's heart tense. When the music ended, the tone suddenly dropped, and the low and soothing male voice gradually lowered: \"Until people with ulterior motives become transparent...... I'll always be near you. I'll also keep exchanging my tomorrow to be able to......... get close with you...\"After the song was over, there was a moment of silence in the entire venue, followed by roaring applause.What's even more outrageous was that because his song was so emotionally contagious, some of the trainees in the audience didn't know which old friend they were thinking of, some of them were actually wiping their tears.Jian Xingsui bowed to the jury: \"Thank you, mentors, my performance is over.\"Tuya opened the microphone first.\u00a0The woman's eyes had turned slightly red. She was trying to organize the language. She said: \"Well, I think, although the way you sing has not reached a particularly professional level, and you might not have handled some parts well, but I must say, your singing ability has its own special points and characteristics.\"Teacher Li said next to him, \"He sings... he sings very emotionally!\"Even the hip-hop singer Liu Shuang opened the microphone and said: \"This really is a kind of rare talent. You sang really well. At first, when I heard that you were doing it for money, I wondered if you had come here just to hang out, but the way you sang this song was amazing.\"Jian Xingsui's originally nervous mood eased a little. Then his eyes fell on Fu Jinxiao cautiously and nervously, as if as long as Film Emperor Fu doesn't speak, he would not get his real evaluation.\u00a0What he didn't know was that when his eyes were looking at Fu Jinxiao, there was some eagerness and expectation that could not be concealed, but he was trying hard to hold back and did not dare to show it.His that awkward appearance made Fu Jinxiao feel inexplicably interesting. It was like a puppy that had been bullied and hurt by everyone in this world was finally seeing someone who could give him some warmth and right judgment. He also looked like someone who really wanted to be recognized and praised, but he didn't dare to show it, so he could only stand pitifully in place.Tuya looked sideways and asked in a low voice, \"What does Mr. Fu think, which rating suits him better? I think B is fine.\"Liu Shuang on the other side heard it and leaned over: \"Will B be too high, that An Ran performed well before, and only got a B.\u00a0We've only had two Bs so far, and don't forget, he can't dance. \"Teacher Li also nodded and whispered: \"Indeed. Won't giving him B make other trainees feel unfair?\"In this way, it seemed that only Tuya supported B, so Tuya faced the two votes of the two mentors and set her eyes on Fu Jinxiao again. She asked in a low voice, \"Mr. Fu, what do you think ne?\".........................................................The author has something to say:The original song is Xue Zhiqian's\u00a0\u5929\u5916\u6765\u7269Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Hi, guys if you like this novel, then please support the author at jjwxc.ENJOY GUYS!!!!!.................................................................Fu Jinxiao who was sitting in the main seat did not answer immediately but picked up Jian Xingsui's information card again.Liu Shuang next to him said: \"Let's take a look first. First of all, this kid's purpose is impure. He came to this stage not for performance, but for money.\"Teacher Li also agreed: \"He has point. To be honest, his singing ability is not particularly good, but his emotional expression is rich and powerful.\u00a0But if you look at a student who was rated as F class before, his singing skills were also good, so why was he rated as F? It's not even that he couldn't dance. \"Liu Shuang nodded: \"I think giving him B is definitely impossible. He also can't dance. Giving F is possible.\"Tuya frowned, and she said, \"I don't think you can just focus on his weaknesses like this.\"The opinions of the people were not unified again.This was also a very rare thing. Jian Xingsui might be the first contestant who needed such a big disagreement among the mentors since the launch of Starlight.Everyone's eyes fell on Fu Jinxiao again.Tuya was curious: \"What does mentor Fu think ne?\"Fu Jinxiao put down the information card in his hand. He was the least likely to speak among this group of people, but when he wanted to speak, everyone would stop and listen to him. They saw him raise his eyebrows slightly, and say slowly: \"If you say that his purpose is impure, what about the others?\"Liu Shuang said, \"Everyone else loves the stage, and they are here in order to make their debut...\"\"If they love the stage so much, then why not just go to the other platforms to dance which is much suitable to show their love for the stage?\" Fu Jinxiao hooked his lips: \"What are they doing here at Starlight?\"It can't be said all of them but what most trainees hold on to is to become a big star, for the sake of making a lot of money, for fame, and for a stage where they can shine. Love for stage and dance can't feed you and your family. More or less, it's just the matter of who can earn more and who earns less through their success. In short, all most everyone's purpose to come here is to earn money.\"Besides...\" Fu Jinxiao dragged his last note, raised his eyelids, and glanced at the uneasy child on the stage: \"Whether he is serious about the purpose of the stage or not, as long as his attitude of singing this song is right, it's fine.\"In a few words, the Film emperor's attitude towards this contestant's performance had been revealed.Tuya smiled unconsciously. With Fu Jinxiao's support, she seemed to have a big backer, which made her waist straight:\u00a0\"I also think the way he sang was very touching. I think he is a very talented kid. It would be a pity if he was sent to Class F or eliminated. He is definitely talented than those who were sent to F. And later in time, I think he can do better.\"Liu Shuang sighed: \"Then where do you think he should be sent to?\"Those mentors were watching Fu Jinxiao again, intentionally or unintentionally. This showed the status among the group of people there. Everyone was waiting for him to make a decision.On the stage, Jian Xingsui also had his heart tighten. Not only him, but also the contestants who had not performed in the contestant seats were feeling quite oppressive. They were also communicating in private:\"What level was this performance of?\"\"B, it's B.\"\"I think F\"2\"If he can only get F when he sang like that, then I'm done.\"\"God, I'm so nervous.\"The discussion was so intense that even Jian Xingsui's roommate Wen Shengge got close to Shen Xingchen and whispered, \"Brother Chen, what grade do you think he will get?\"Shen Xingchen didn't dare to say anything else, but the Shen family and the Fu family had a very deep friendship. Once, Shen Xingchen's mother had joked that if there was another youngest child in their family, she would have accepted Fu Jinxiao as a son-in-law.\u00a0The two families were still able to join an in-law relationship because the youngest child was indeed born, but it turned out that child died as soon as she was born. This matter became taboo in the Shen family, and no one dared to mention it.1Later, although the marriage was not formed, the friendship between the two families was still there, especially the relationship between his elder brother Shen Minglang and Fu Jinxiao was very close. So somehow, Shen Xingchen still had some understanding of Fu Jinxiao.Hearing Wen Shengge's question, Shen Xingchen said, \"I think, it depends on the situation.\"Wen Shengge: \"What do you mean?\"\"Brother Fu probably won't give too high marks.\" Shen Xingchen replied.Wen Shengge was a little puzzled: \"Why?\"Shen Xingchen hadn't spoken yet when mentor Li, who was in charge of hosting on the stage not far away, had already obtained the results. He held the microphone and coughed a few times: \"Okay, now let's announce the results, Jian Xingsui, your final rating result is...\"The lights at the scene dimmed all of a sudden.Teacher Li went silent for a moment making everyone anxious to death. Many people were looking forward to the results.Jian Xingsui's hand holding the microphone tightened. Teacher Li smiled slightly and continued, \"Congratulations, your final rating result is ...................C.\"There was an uproar over the entire venue.About this result, some people thought it was high, some people thought it was low.\u00a0Some people even thought that Jian Xingsui was really lucky to get a C by only singing a song without dancing.On the stage, Jian Xingsui was stunned for a moment, then bowed: \"Thank you, mentor.\"Tuya picked up the microphone and said, \"This result is the result of our discussion together. There is a reason for rating you this level. Do you want to know?\"Jian Xingsui was sincere: \"I want to.\"Tuya stopped talking and she looked sideways at Fu Jinxiao.Film emperor Fu was not going to speak, but Tuya had already said so, so he still picked up the microphone. This was the first time he had a direct conversation with Jian Xingsui. His voice was lazy and elegant: \"Do you know why you got JUST C ?\"''JUST'' this word was very subtle.The subtext was, I think your skill should not have only gotten a C, but it could have been higher.The people at the scene were all comprehensible people, and they immediately heard the actual meaning of this sentence. Therefore, many people looked at Jian Xingsui with some envy in their eyes.\"Because you have the wrong thoughts about this stage.\" Fu Jinxiao saw Jian Xingsui's nervous appearance, and said slowly: \"The thought I'm talking about is not about you competing for 20,000 yuan.\"Jian Xingsui was a little puzzled. He didn't understand, if it wasn't for the 20,000 yuan, what would it be?Fu Jinxiao said: \"The problem with you was that when you came to the stage, you did not perform with the idea of winning, but with the thought that you would be eliminated.\"Jian Xingsui had participated in the show with the intention of getting eliminated just after the first episode. Although he had done his best for this stage, he had not performed with the idea of winning, but with the idea of losing.\u00a0A person who respects the stage, a person who has already participated in the competition, should hold on to the victory and perform with a strong belief.\u00a0If it is presented to the audience with a mixed mentality, it is of course wrong. Fu Jinxiao's strictness has always been well-known in the industry, and this time was of course no exception.\"Since you are already standing on this stage, since there is an opponent, no matter how powerful the opponent is, you must perform with the heart of doing your best to win.\"\u00a0Fu Jinxiao's amorous Phoneix eyes always seemed to be warm, which always made people unable to figure out his mood on most occasions.\u00a0But at this moment, when talking with Jian Xingsui, the coldness in his eyes was shown clearly.His aura was very strong, and his gentleness on ordinary days was already awe-inspiring.\u00a0Once his face sank, the atmosphere at the scene was depressed and no one dared to speak, including Jian Xing Sui who was standing heartbroken on the stage.But when Fu Jinxiao put down the microphone, his lips hooked, and he said the last sentence slowly: \"After all, I never taught you how to lose.\"This sentence seemed a bit nonsensical and no one in the venue could understand it.\u00a0But Jian Xingsui didn't know why, at this moment, he suddenly seemed to understand what the film emperor meant.Because Fu Jinxiao was someone who never admitted defeat.His works, his style, what he passed on to his fans and others were always a spirit of being brave and fearless.So little boy, how can you be a coward when I had never once taught you how to lose.Jian Xingsui held the microphone. He opened his mouth incoherently, trying to organize the language.\u00a0In the end, there were thousands of words stuck in his heart. But because his mouth was rather stupid, he didn't know what to say to express his feelings, so he could only bow deeply and say seriously, \"Thank you, teacher.\"Tuya smiled.\u00a0She picked up the mic and said as if to comfort the child: \"Don't be depressed. Have a little confidence in yourself. Confidence is the most important thing. Your singing style was very good. I am looking forward to your performance in the future. We are all looking forward to it.\"Teacher Li also said, \"Young man, it's hard to get this 20,000 yuan. You have to work hard.\"Jian Xingsui was amused by the mentors. He bowed again: \"Thank you, teachers(referring to the mentors), I will work hard.\"Netizens in the live broadcast room had also watched this contestant's performance very seriously:\"This guy was actually quite good.\"\"Actually, I think he should have gotten B.\"\"Him getting B? Even An Ran had just gotten a B. They can't be the same.\"\"He doesn't even know how to dance. If he was given B, I would have suspected that he was the film emperor's someone someone.......\"After Jian Xingsui went back, the people following their turn started another round of performances. This time, the stage progress was very fast but even till the evening, not everyone got to record.When they went back, Shen Xingchen complained, \"I didn't get my turn after sitting all day.\"Jian Xingsui comforted him: \"Tomorrow will be your day.\"Ning Ze, a man who had never been very talkative, came back from fetching water and said for the first time: \"Brother Fu is the main tutor this time and he is a very strict person.\u00a0Many people had performed well today but still, most of us got only F. Those who could enter C and B should already consider them as lucky. A has not appeared so far, and it will definitely be more difficult for those who will perform tomorrow. \"In the dormitory, there was no camera, so everyone let go of a lot of grievances when they talk.Wen Shengge and Shen Xingchen belonged to the same company, and this time they were also performing as a group, so they had somewhat gotten close. Wen Shengge came over and whispered: \"Brother Chen, don't be afraid of your performance tomorrow, I think you will definitely get an A.\u00a0After all, Brother Fu knows you and has such a good relationship with your family. So he certainly won't give you a bad grade. \"Shen Xingchen sneered: \"Fuck, he won't give any special attention to anyone. Since my childhood, I've never seen that man giving favor to anyone.\"The film emperor da ren (great person) who seemed very approachable in the industry, seemed to have good connections all over the entertainment industry. In fact, the more he seemed to be easy to get along with, the more difficult he was to approach. He had gotten the coldest heart among all the people Shen Xingchen had ever known.Shen Xingchen looked at Jian Xingsui, who was obediently sitting beside him. He took a deep breath and said, \"But I don't know why, I think he likes you very much.\"Jian Xingsui was taken aback: \"Why?\"\"He looks very serious, doesn't he, but haven't you noticed? He had been playing with a pen during every group's performances.\" Shen Xingchen said in a low voice, \"He was basically half closing his eyes and resting his mind. He seemed to have been completely absorbed in the performances, in fact, once he started playing with the pen, he hadn't put his mind on others at all. Even when that An Ran's group was performing, he was only playing with his pen.\"Jian Xingsui really hadn't noticed that.\"But he suddenly acted differently when it was your turn. After you went to the stage, he simply didn't turn his pen!\" Shen Xingchen looked like he was really surprised: \"Also, I saw that he always took your information card when he had nothing to do. He, in fact, had never touched anyone's information card even once except for yours.\"3...........................................The author has something to say:Shen Xingchen: I have seen through everything!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13After Jian Xingsui listened to Shen Xingchen's words, it was like listening to some horror story. He subconsciously retorted: \"It should be a coincidence.\"1Shen Xingchen said, \"Then it's the coincidence that belongs to you.\"Jian Xingsui couldn't explain it. He was totally confused.\u00a0Half of his heart was a little happy about the beauty that Shen Xingchen had assumed for himself, but the cruel facts on the other side told him that it was impossible. Although the plot seemed to be a little different from what he had known before, the butterfly's wings were slightly flapping, but it definitely won't cause a much bigger change.He was just a cannon fodder.\u00a0In his last life, he died miserably because he didn't have a clear understanding of himself. Death at least gave him more brains, and he would no longer be so stupid to imagine things that didn't belong to him.\"Maybe it's because he hadn't met someone poorer than me before.\" Jian Xingsui laughed at himself lightly: \"So he took a few more glances.\"Shen Xingchen sneered: \"Look at your self-deprecating self....\"Who was Fu Jinxiao? He has been wandering around the world for so many years, what kind of person or thing was there that he hasn't seen?\u00a0How is it possible for that old fox to really treat a person differently just because of 20,000 yuan?But this matter seemed to remind him something. Shen Xingchen looked Jian Xingsui from up to down and said hesitantly, \"To be honest, you indeed don't seem to have anything special.\"Wen Shengge came over and smiled. He said, \"When I first saw him, I felt that Suisui was someone who was very difficult to get along with.\"\"Actually, he looks super silly ah.\" Shen Xingchen flicked Jian Xingsui's forehead and smiled: \"Super silly to the point making people feel super comfortable to be with you.\"Jian Xingsui covered his head: \"I'm already silly and you are still hitting me on the head.\"Shen Xingchen hahahaed and said happily: \"So what if I hit you in the head, are you going to go to the teacher and complain? I'm not afraid of anyone here ah, will you go to complain to Brother Fu?\"Jian Xingsui glared at him angrily.At this moment, the door outside rang. It was a very slight sound, but it was quite clear at night.An elegant and clear voice sounded: \"Excuse me, I seemed to have disturbed you guys.\"The room suddenly fell silent.Shen Xingchen's arrogant smile just now froze on his face.\u00a0He turned his head in disbelief and saw a tall man standing at the door. Once Fu Jinxiao stepped off the formal stage, he had taken off his suit jacket and he was casually carrying it on his arm. He was only wearing a white shirt. Compared with the dignified elegance of the day, now the T-shirt made him look a bit more thug and villain type.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows and said slowly, \"Were you looking for me?\"Shen Xingchen wished he could live on another planet at this moment. The originally arrogant and domineering person stammered, \"No, no, brother, did you hear me wrong?\"\"Are you sure?\"Fu Jinxiao set his eyes on Jian Xingsui and opened his lips: \"Did I really hear it wrong?\"Why would you ask me, sir!Jian Xingsui seemed to have picked up a hot potato. He was the one who stuttered: \"Ah, that, that..ahh...that..this..you....me.......\"Fu Jinxiao walked in. His leather shoes stepped on the smooth floor of the dormitory, making a crisp sound. The man approached and stood in front of Jian Xingsui. This was the first time they were so close. The voice sounded above his head: \"Look up.\"Jian Xingsui raised his head obediently and met those amorous phoenix eyes. Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows: \"Do I look like I eat people?\"2Jian Xingsui shook his head hastily.Fu Jinxiao chuckled: \"Then why are you panicking?\"In fact, there was not only one person who was panicking in this dormitory. The whole dormitory was panicking. Film emperor Fu was a senior in the entertainment industry. His appearance here was as terrifying as the sudden appearance of the principal in the student dormitory.Just when everyone was puzzled, the staff of the program group came in with a camera, and one person said, \"We are here to check the dormitory. Everyone in the dormitory will open their suitcases and we will check whether you have brought any contraband(prohibited things).\"Because this dormitory was first in line, it was naturally the first to be checked.Shen Xingchen wailed, \"No way, I still haven't organized my things.\"Fu Jinxiao glanced at him: \"What are you screaming for?\"Shen Xingchen immediately shut up. Fu Jinxiao's sound effect was more effective than anything.The staff, including others, didn't dare to provoke this great dude. They had just casually invited Fu Jinxiao to check, but they hadn't expected the effect to be so good. Sure enough, the Film emperor could make other people panic just by standing silently.The suitcases of several of them had been opened. And the things that everyone brought were displayed in front of the audience. At 9 o'clock in the evening, most office workers who had been busy all day could also watch the live broadcast. Many people were very interested :\"Although it seems immoral, I'm so looking forward to it. I'm so excited, folks!\"\"Hahaha, what in the world did the male stars bring?\"\"Could it be a musical instrument or a dance costume or something?\"Obviously, the audience was still a little too naive.When the suitcases were opened, there were many incredible things in front of everyone: game consoles, tablets, dumbbells, bean paste...The film emperor's eyes fell coolly on the bottle of the bean paste.Jian Xingsui said embarrassedly, \"Actually, it is quite delicious.\"The staff couldn't help laughing out loud. Everyone knew this child who was here for 20,000 yuan, but what they didn't expect was that the child's life could really be so miserable.\u00a0They continued to check Jian Xingsui's suitcase. They found Chinese sauce, bean paste, pancakes, and even a thermos cup inside.So the staff asked, \"Why did you bring such a big thermos cup yourself?\"Jian Xingsui answered honestly: \"Because this way, I don't have to buy water from outside. The prices here are very expensive, and they all sell bottled mineral water.\"His answer can be said to be very sincere.The audience in the live broadcast room was already happy:\"I had gone to that studio before and found that only bottled mineral water was sold there!\"\"Yes, the water sold in some places is very expensive.\"\"Brother, it seems that you really need 20,000 yuan!\"The staff said, \"This dumbbell?\"The taciturn Ning Ze took a step: \"It's mine, I'm used to exercising before going to bed.\"\"But we have one in our gym.\"\"This dumbbell has been with me since I was a child, I'm used to it.\"Staff member:\"......\"However, these were not actually contraband, on the contrary, Shen Xingchen's game console and tablet were contraband. When those things were taken away, Shen Xingchen began to mourn, grabbing Fu Jinxiao's clothes by the corner: \"Don't take it away ah. I'll play for a while at night, brother, you are so cruel, I will complain to my elder brother...\"The person who previously had threatened Jian Xingsui just before was now like a primary school student in front of Fu Jinxiao.Fu Jinxiao was able to deal with this dog clinging to him with ease. He paused and lowered his eyes: \"Are you sure you want to continue howling?\"Shen Xingchen: \"Ah...\"\"If your voice is louder, the other dormitory contestants will hear you.\" Fu Jinxiao slowly lowered his voice, with a small smile at the corners of his mouth, he said softly: \"When the time comes, I believe you won't be able to be so arrogant anymore......\"Like the devil's whisper, he spoke with a smile.Shen Xingchen's howling disappeared instantly. With an expression of ''I understood'', he even urged, \"Go, go to the next room, don't be late, brother.\"Others were dumbfounded watching this scene.The several of them who were far away didn't hear what they said. They just thought that Fu Jinxiao was amazing, to be able to tame this arrogant young master.The audience in the live broadcast room listened to it, and the screen was full of hahaha:\"It's still my brother Fu who is strong.\"\"What a black-bellied man.\"\"This group of people is so cute. In fact, the whole dormitory's atmosphere is really nice.\"During the whole operation tonight, many people had their electronic products confiscated. In fact, all four mentors had participated in this activity. There were howling sounds from many dormitories. Only the row in charge of Fu Jinxiao did not have that activity.\u00a0When Film emperor Fu stood at the door, all the contestants chose to be obedient and not dare to make trouble.After the event was over, there was a broadcast voice: \"All the items have been collected, and now everyone will go downstairs to receive your ID cards. This is the universal star card in the show. There is money in the star card, and this money is responsible for your daily meals and expenses.\"Jian Xingsui's dormitory 403 also heard it.Just one person from each dormitory could go to take their own and their roommates' cards.Shen Xingchen was shocked: \"Anyway, I won't go to take it.\"Ning Ze's heart was only thinking about practicing dumbbells.Wen Shengge looked at Jian Xingsui a little embarrassedly and said, \"That....... Suisui ah, every night at this time, I do my beauty exercises ah.\"\"...\"Was he the only one left?Jian Xingsui resigned and said, \"Okay.\"Anyway, he doesn't like to make a fuss about small things now. So he could do what he was ought to do.\u00a0When he arrived at the lobby on the first floor, most of the dormitories had basically finished collecting their things. Jian Xingsui thought that there should be no one left here.\u00a0Who knew that there were still several tutors sitting there. He gathered his mind and walked over. Because the tutor who had checked their dormitory was Fu Jinxiao, he had to go to Film emperor Fu to collect it.This was another tense challenge for Jian Xingsui.He walked over slowly, and said, \"Hello, Brother Fu.\"Fu Jinxiao, who was sitting in front of the table, was leaning back lazily on the chair. There was a form in front of him. The form had the number of star cards and there was a box next to it.\u00a0Jian Xingsui signed it to claim it, and then handed it to Fu Jinxiao: \"I've filled it out.\"Fu Jinxiao stretched out his hand to take it and replied lightly: \"There are star cards in the box. Take the cards according to the numbers of your and your roommates.\"Jian Xingsui nodded obediently: \"Okay.\"He lowered his head and looked very serious, just like the kid in the rice cake shop who was still working hard with an injured hand. On a certain afternoon, in a place no one knew about, he was also earnestly and stubbornly defending his idol.Fu Jinxiao casually glanced at the form and said unintentionally, \"Did Shen Xingchen bully you in the dormitory?\"Jian Xingsui's movements paused. He remembered that tonight, they seemed to have been caught making fuss, so he shook his head gently, \"No.\"Fu Jinxiao chuckled inexplicably.Jian Xingsui didn't know why, but he suddenly became a little nervous, thinking that some people's aura was really strong. This guy in front of him was neither angry nor arrogant, but he was about to die from fear.\"I know his personality. The Shen family has a rich family background. This kid's temper is spoiled. You share a dormitory with him, so you probably know how much angry he gets.\" Fu Jinxiao's attitude was lazy and his slender legs were overlapped. His words were light. It was like he was chatting with the family member: \"This time he was sent here to sharpen his spirit, so you don't have to excuse him. If he is really out of order and misbehaves, you can really come and complain to me.\"1......Jian Xingsui's eyelashes trembled slightly. Did he really see the scene in the dormitory, and take it to heart?But Fu Jinxiao was definitely not being worried for himself.\u00a0It should also be to help Shen Xingchen manage his temper, so he specially explained himself. It made sense.\"Of course.\" When Jian Xingsui was still thinking about it, Fu Jinxiao put down the form in his hand, raised his eyes, and lifted his eyelids to look at him. The corners of his lips curved: \"More than that, if he still bullies you, then you can always come to find me.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14''You can always come to find me.''This short sentence hovered in Jian Xingsui's ear like a spell and fell on the tip of his heart like a heavy hammer.He raised his head in disbelief and met Fu Jinxiao's face. He saw the man sitting there with dark and deep eyes. When he was looked at, he felt that he was valued.Jian Xingsui was nervous. He was afraid of Fu Jinxiao's misunderstanding, so he said: \"Xingchen didn't bully me, you(polite), don't think too much about this. We were just kidding. You also know his temper.\u00a0In fact, there is nothing bad about it. I didn't say anything when you entered the door at that time, because...\"Fu Jinxiao nodded lightly, and he said warmly: \"I know. It's because you were afraid of affecting my relationship with him. You didn't want it to make things difficult for me.\"Jian Xingsui was stunned.Obviously, he hadn't said anything yet, but Fu Jinxiao understood everything he meant.1This feeling was really amazing.\u00a0It was like countless times when he stood in front of the Jian family or An Ran and others, no matter how he explained, no one believed him, and no one wanted to hear him finish.But Fu Jinxiao just sat there quietly, listening to his stumbling explanation, and understood his heart so smoothly. He didn't need to explain too much and the other party didn't even misunderstand him.\"I know.\" Fu Jinxiao looked at him and curled his lips: \"I can rest assured now that he has a roommate like you by his side.\"This man's strictness at work was really severe while gentleness in private conversations was really gentle.Jian Xingsui wanted to say something at first, but he swallowed the words again. He lowered his head, but his nose was slightly sour. He had endured it for too long, and suddenly he was understood. The first reaction was that he was at a loss.However, Fu Jinxiao seemed to see through his fragile soul under his ill-spoken words and did not embarrass him: \"Okay, it's getting late. Go back ba, unless you want to work as a security guard?\"Jian Xingsui was embarrassed, so he bowed: \"Okay, Brother Fu, I'm going back.\"Fu Jinxiao responded lightly, \"Yeah.\"Jian Xingsui turned around to leave, but heard the man say, \"Wait.\"Jian Xingsui looked back suspiciously.\"You sang well today.\" Fu Jinxiao was no longer sitting lazily, but looked directly at him: \"Next time, keep trying.\"It was obviously just an ordinary sentence.\u00a0But when it fell into Jian Xingsui's ears, his heart seemed to shrink with joy at that moment. He was praised..................he was recognized..............what's more, he was recognized by his idol.Jian Xingsui actually had felt that he could not pass the first audition because he had no background and no support. The most important reason was that the Jian family might feel that he was bullying An Ran after seeing it. A person like himself could be easily replaced by the show team just based on the Jian family members' one call. So he knew that he would not go far.But Fu Jinxiao's approval seemed to have suddenly given him a little hope and confidence.\"Well, I will try my best.\" Jian Xingsui said softly and he smiled at Fu Jinxiao: \"Thank you, Brother Fu.\"Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows slightly.He had always seen this kid have a straight face before. He didn't know if the kid himself knew that.\u00a0He was obviously young but his brows were always slightly wrinkled as if he was always vigilant.\u00a0He looked preoccupied at all times, like a frightened little hedgehog, ready to hide at any time. It was probably because of this that people would unconsciously pay more attention to this kid.He laughed at this moment.\u00a0Just because of a casual encouragement from himself, he actually looked pretty when he smiled. Although he had a short haircut, his lips were red and his teeth were white always carrying a shy smile.\u00a0There always seemed to be light in his eyes. And it was at this moment that he looked like a young man of his age, not a little old man with a heavy heart.......On the second day,This was the second day of the first round of recording.Because of the popularity on the first day, the number of people in the live broadcast room did not drop but increased, and the popularity of the show had become very high.This time it was really Shen Xingchen's turn to perform.\u00a0Don't look at the fact that this young master looked a little unreliable on ordinary days, like a son of a noble family, but he was actually really skilled. His singing and dancing skills were very nice, and his expressiveness on the stage was also very strong. He had really worked hard and had real talent.Almost all the mentors were very satisfied and the ratings they gave were of course not low. After unanimous discussion, they gave a high score of A, and all the contestants, including the audience, had too much to comment:\"Little brother is very sassy\"\"He's really amazing!\"\"Seeing his dance makes my blood boil.\"\"This brother really has a lot of energy, so energetic!\"Jian Xingsui waited for Shen Xingchen to come back and said sincerely, \"Your performance was outstanding, you are too skilled.\"Shen Xingchen's forehead was covered in sweat. The young man was of course very proud after hearing this comment, but he still wanted to brag in front of his younger brother: \"It's normal, I just performed normally.\"Jian Xingsui pursed his lips and smiled.Shen Xingchen noticed that there was a row of people sitting not far from their row, and one of them was Zhou Xun. For some unknown reason, Zhou Xun always looked at them with a sneaky look.Shen Xingchen's violent temper came up: \"Fuck, what is that kid looking at?\"Jian Xingsui tried to calm him down: \"It's alright, just ignore him.\"\"What are you afraid of?\" Shen Xingchen glared at him and muttered, \"It's a shame that we're in front of a camera, otherwise I would have cleaned him up.\"Jian Xingsui didn't know whether to laugh or cry.Sometimes, he thinks that Shen Xingchen's temper was somewhat similar to his own. To be precise, his former temper was somewhat similar.3By the afternoon, more than 100 contestants had already finished the audition. What everyone didn't expect was that just when everyone thought the recording would end, the host stood up and started to announce something new: \"Because many of the contestants got relatively low grades in the first round, many people may have felt that they didn't perform well. Maybe now you guys have new ideas and ways you want to perform with. It's okay. That's quite understandable. So now let's announce the new rules.\u00a0It is also what everyone is most looking forward to watch, right. Do you know what it is? \"The scene was silent for a while before someone shouted, \"Battle(originally in English)!\"More and more people shouted out with some excitement: \"Battle, battle, start the battle!\"It used to be group and individual performances, but now the new rules were definitely a duel challenge between contestants and contestants. Mr. Li also showed a mysterious smile: \"Yes, let me announce the rules of this battle.\u00a0Now, starting from Group F, a representative from Group F will be recommended by the contestants. This representative can freely choose a member of Group C who he thinks he can challenge. If the challenge is successful, the player can successfully advance to D. If a player in Group C can keep his place, at the same time, he has a chance to be re-rated. \"This was the challenge.If you choose a player who you can challenge successfully, then you will have a chance to be re-rated.Teacher Li smiled and said, \"At the same time, after this battle is over, all the students who have succeeded in the challenge will become the center of the theme song of \"Starlight\" together with the members of Class A!\"There was an uproar in the audience.Especially contestants from F grade were very excited. They were internally having a heated discussion about how to gain benefits from this great opportunity.Wen Shengge's rating was C. He was on the same level as Jian Xingsui. He came over and whispered: \"Brother Jian, do you think the people in Group F will choose to challenge us here?\"Jian Xingsui shook his head: \"I don't know.\"\"If I'll lose the battle, I will fall into Group F!\" Wen Shengge was a little scared: \"I really want to pray now that I don't get selected.\"Jian Xingsui didn't have much thought.First, he felt that he had no sense of existence, and secondly, even if he fell to F, it meant nothing to him.Shen Xingchen leaned over and sneered: \"Okay okay, don't worry about it. Those people will not choose you if they think you have any potential. Of course, if you're not capable, then keep being afraid!!!\"Jian Xingsui: \"...\"You really know how to comfort people ah brother.Just as everyone was talking, the representative recommended by Group F came out. It was somehow an unexpected candidate - Zhou Xun.Zhou Xun, who came to the stage, gave a speech. In general, he meant that he didn't perform well in the first round.\u00a0This time, he is ashamed and will prove himself. He was a rap-majored contestant and of course, he was going to perform a rap this time.Teacher Li asked, \"Who is the contestant of Group C you want to challenge?\"Zhou Xun's eyes fell on the people in Group C. After turning around, he said firmly, \"Jian Xingsui.\"After the name was spit out, some people felt surprised while some people thought it was expected. Jian Xingsui himself was a little helpless, while Shen Xingchen next to him sneered a few times, full of sarcasm.Teacher Li said with a smile: \"Before the group F players perform, I want to announce another additional rule we have this time. For example, if Jian Xingsui will successfully takes up the challenge, then you will get a chance to be re-rated and you will also have a chance to become the center of our theme song this time. Because the rewards are generous, we also have a rule that the contestants who accept the challenge, for example, if they want to sing the same song as the challenger, will have 20 minutes of preparation time in the middle.\"Logically speaking, this rule was not particularly difficult.But the problem was that Zhou Xun was a rap singer and the songs he chose only had rap from the first verse to last. It was very difficult for Jian Xingsui, who was not a rap singer, to learn a rap song in 20 minutes.Teacher Li added: \"Of course, the contestants have the right to choose whether to accept the challenge or not.\"At this moment, almost everyone's eyes fell on Jian Xingsui.The audience was also very much looking forward to his answer:\"Brother buzz cut, finish that challenger!\"\"Don't be cowardly!\"\"Challenge him back!\"The other players felt that it was really difficult for Jian Xingsui. It turns out that getting delicious rewards was not so easy. Isn't it just the trick of the program team to send C graders to the pit? This way F graders will be able to choose from whatever they are good at and use that against the C graders. The difficulty was really great. Competing with Zhou Xun, especially Jian Xingsui, who had never studied rap professionally, will definitely suffer. It will be miserable for him to drop directly from C to F at that time.Everyone was looking at Jian Xingsui, but Jian Xingsui quietly set his eyes on the mentor's platform, where the man sitting in the center was leaning on the chair, seemingly careless. But once the guy sitting in the audience glanced at him, Fu Jinxiao also lifted his eyelids and looked straight at him. Their eyes were looking straight at each other. At this moment silence was better than sound.Not long ago, on this stage, he had also taught Jian Xingsui to face everyone's challenges with courage and not to be afraid of losing, but Jian Xingsui, who was reborn once and suffered losses, was always cautious and did not have that kind of courage.Behind him came the shrill voices of other contestants discussing:\"He doesn't dare?\"\"Isn't this inevitable?\"\"Hahaha, he was lucky to get C before, but now we're gonna his true ability.\"Those small voices were very similar to the voices of those who had once humiliated him and insulted him behind his back.\u00a0A long time ago, it was also because of this kind of discussion that Jian Xingsui had began to doubt himself. It was because of these kinds of comments that he had started to feel sensitive and inferior. He was desperately in the need of some warmth and encouragement.......a little bit............. a very little bit of it would also have been enough.There are wounds that never show on the body but are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds.At that time, when he was trapped in the prison of depression, he had come into contact with Fu Jinxiao's songs and his works by chance which had allowed him to adjust and slowly gain some courage and strength.Was he ready to face this challenge?Maybe he won't win, and since the difficulty is so high, he might even lose face.But if he would just give up here, did that mean he won? Everyone was only giving him disappointed and mocking glances now.However, what he saw in Fu Jinxiao's eyes was not a mocking look but a quiet depth. That person was just sitting there quietly, but his eyes had something that told him, ''DON'T GIVE UP. THERE'S ALREADY NOTHING LEFT FOR YOU TO LOSE. EVEN IF YOU LOSE, SO WHAT?''+(T/N: Fu Jinxiao meant: So what even if you lose? I'm always there for you. Just show everyone you are my fan and Fu JinXiao's man.).................................................Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Jian Xingsui took a deep breath, stood up, faced the camera and everyone's gaze, and said, \"I'm willing to accept the challenge.\"The scene was silent at first. Then there were unstoppable cheers. Some people stood up and applauded while others were watching the fun and whistling.Teacher Li asked, \"Are you sure?\"Jian Xingsui nodded.Zhou Xun showed a somewhat sarcastic smile: \"Do you really want to accept it?\"Jian Xingsui's answer this time was without hesitation: \"I accept.\"After seeing that Jian Xingsui had agreed, several mentors on the mentor's platform even had a completely different opinion about him from the first time he had come to participate in the audition. He obviously seemed to have more momentum and more confidence now.Tuya applauded in surprise.Fu Jinxiao hooked his lips and smiled, with a touch of approval in his eyes.Because he was a challenger, Zhou Xun started his singing. The song he picked was too difficult to rap \"You Can't Stop Me Unstoppable\". This was a very hot and explosive song.\u00a0The front tune was very high, and Zhou Xun's own appearance was that kind of wild. So his style matched with that kind of energetic song very well.:You can't stop me(originally in English)I'm unstoppablebetter, run, away(originally in English)better roll awayWhen l enter the game mode huu(originally in English)when we enter the game modewe flash like lightningBreaking through the boundless darkness and danger is my habit...Some wild voices resounded throughout the competition hall, and the cheers were loud. Zhou Xun was really good at rap. He performed well in this song. However, this kind of fast-paced rap could make a person who had never come into contact with the fast-paced rap sing the same song too difficult.After the performance, sweat fell from his forehead. Zhou Xun gasped and thanked: \"Thank you, everyone.\"Teacher Li praised: \"Your rap skills are very good.\"Zhou Xun bowed: \"Thank you, teacher.\"His performance was really excellent. It could be said that if everything went smoothly and if Jian Xingsui couldn't give a good performance, then it was obvious that he will succeed in this challenge.Mentor Li looked at Jian Xingsui and said, \"Are you ready?\"Jian Xingsui nodded lightly.During the 20 minutes of preparation, the other contestants could also rest, but they couldn't hang around. They could only go to the bathroom or to drink some water or go to the makeup room to make up.\u00a0When they were free, they were just talking about Jian Xingsui. Many people were wondering if he could win Zhou Xun, especially those who were with An Ran: \"Ran Ran, that bully, can he rap?\"An Ran never knew about that. So he softly said, \"I don't know, but in my impression he only sings occasionally.\"Actually, he preferred listening to music.Because Jian Xingsui hadn't taken many things when he had left Jian's house, when An Ran had moved there, he had found out that in his room, there was a wall full of Fu Jinxiao's albums. So he had assumed that this person should be quite fond of music.An Ran said: \"Jian Xingsui is actually quite good. He went to a foreign music school. I have always envied him. I am far worse than him.\" (T/N: Tsk tsk tsk)When he said this, the other teammates felt distressed and quickly comforted:\"Ran Ran, he only relied on his family's money to study abroad!\"\"He's far worse than you.\"\"I was exactly thinking why could he sing so good, it turned out to be the gift of his family's money.\" (T/N: Wait....what is this asshole talking about? Jian family gifted Jian Xingsui's voice??)\"He is completely incomparable to you. You rely only on your own efforts.\"\"This time he will definitely reveal his true ability.\"While everyone was comforting An Ran, Jian Xingsui was rehearsing for the piano performance under the stage. His earphones were playing that rap song over and over again. The explosive songs reverberated in his ears. He sat there quietly. He didn't move for five minutes.Even the vocal teacher was a little anxious.Just when the vocal teacher thought he was going to sit there like that for twenty minutes, Jian Xingsui suddenly stood up. He bent down and asked the vocal teacher, \"Hello, I want to ask, can I not use background music for my performance later?\"The vocal teacher was stunned: \"Huh?\"Jian Xingsui smiled, feeling a little embarrassed: \"I want to sing a cappella version of this song. So later can you please give me this piano to play? I will play the background music myself.\"There were very few people who made such a request. Generally speaking, it is very difficult to play and sing at the same time. Besides, his performance was going to be broadcasted live. What's more, the song he was going to play wasn't even a familiar song to him. Under such circumstances, how could someone make such a request?The vocal music teacher thought about it and said, \"I have to ask the directors and mentors for advice.\"Jian Xingsui bowed: \"Thank you.\"The vocal music teacher went to discuss with the tutors and the program team.Jian Xingsui, who stayed where he was, didn't dare to do anything but just waited stupidly. He sat down and started to press the keys according to the arrangement he had just thought of in his heart.\u00a0Little by little, he started to press the keys according to the progress of the lyrics of the song. All the lyrics and tones seemed to form an equation in his mind, regrouped and reorganized.When he reached one of the climaxes of the song, Jian Xingsui's hand stopped. He didn't know how to proceed better here. The piano sound stopped abruptly, and the fingers that fell on it also stopped. When Jian Xingsui fell silent again, the clock on the wall was already moving towards 15 minutes, and he was running out of time.At this moment, a pair of slender hands fell. In place of Jian Xingsui's hand, that hand pressed a few piano notes, which perfectly matched the previous tune, and this passage seemed to be the finishing touch. The tunes connected smoothly.Jian Xingsui raised his head in surprise and met Fu Jinxiao's eyes.Fu Jinxiao said, \"Go ahead.\"In terms of music, some people seemed to have a soul that resonates.Jian Xingsui calmed down and continued to play until the end of the song. A thin layer of sweat had formed on his forehead. The original song was still playing in the headphones, and he already had a new version of this song in his heart .After Jian Xingsui played the whole song, he turned his eyes and realized that Fu Jinxiao was still standing behind him. So he immediately stood up in a panic, but because he was too panicked, he hit his knee, and immediately made a \"hiss\" sound. His face turned pale in some pain.Fu Jinxiao chuckled softly: \"What are you doing ne?\"Jian Xingsui covered his knees, then let go and said, \"No, I accidentally bumped into it.\"Fu Jinxiao leaned beside the piano stand and joked casually: \"Are you always this reckless?\"\"No.\" Jian Xingsui hurriedly shook his head and said softly, \"I just didn't expect you to be here.\"Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows: \"You're not happy to see me?\"Jian Xing's head was about to fall because of his continuous shaking: \"No, no, I'm not unhappy, I'm happy, so happy...very happy.....\"After carelessly muttering those words, he realized later what he said. Those words were more or less ambiguous when matched with Fu Jinxiao's earlier question. Jian Xingsui's earlobe unconsciously stained with a touch of red. He felt a little embarrassed while glancing at Fu Jinxiao.Fu Jinxiao didn't make fun of it. He just explained: \"I just didn't want to bother you because I saw you were playing the piano seriously.\"It turned out that no matter how much of a big personality or a great public figure a person is, no matter how precious his time is, he is still willing to stand behind you and wait for you quietly when you are busy.\u00a0He won't disturb you, he will just stand there watching you, and only step up to help you when you encounter difficulties, and then return everything to you, in a well-mannered and courteous manner.Jian Xingsui's heart warmed. He bowed, \"Thank you.\"\"What are you thanking for.\" Fu Jinxiao lifted his eyelids and looked at him. His dark eyes felt a little oppressive: \"I'm here to tell you that you can sing a cappella without the background music. It's almost time, and you'll be on stage soon. Are you ready?\"Jian Xingsui took a deep breath: \"Ready.\"Fu Jinxiao curled his lips and called out, \"Jian Xingsui.\"\"Um?\"When he looked up, he saw the tall man standing up straight. When he turned back to the mentor's platform, he dropped a sentence: \"JIA YOU!!!! (which means come on, you can do it or fighting!!).\"It seemed like he had said it casually, but this kind of encouragement gave Jian Xingsui a lot of courage inexplicably. When the spotlight fell, he stood on the stage again.A piano was brought in the middle of the stage, which surprised many people:\"Isn't it a rap song?\"\"Piano rap?\"\"What kind of weird combination is this???\"No matter how everyone guessed, the spotlights fell, and the audience's expectations seemed to have dropped a lot. Only the person in the middle of the stage was lit. Many people were waiting for the background music to play, but there was no background music.\u00a0The person sitting by the piano raised his hand, and the crisp and elegant piano sound poured out. Then Jian Xingsui sang a cappella:You can't stop me(originally in English)I'm unstoppablebetter, run, away(originally in English)better roll awayWhen l enter the game mode huuuuuwoooo(originally in English)when we enter the game modewe flash like lightningBreaking through the boundless darkness and danger is my habit...Obviously, it was a very passionate song, but it was sung slowly from his low voice.\u00a0With the elegant and gentle piano sound, it was like a lovelorn boy expressing his thoughts to a woman he loves.Not only the audience in the live broadcast room suddenly exploded in roars, but even Zhou Xun, who was originally determined to win, including a group of students who wanted to watch the fun all widened their eyes. It was unbelievable that someone could complete the adaptation of a song in 20 minutes!The piano sound had a touch of sadness, and the deep male voice was like a lover's painful begging:\"My tears will be used as fuel, the acceleration is burning...\"\"Never compromise, I can't compromise...\"Jian Xingsui's singing was very contagious. This was something that he was recognized on the first stage. When he had sung love songs, the feeling of heartbreak had come like a wave. And now when he sang these flaming lyrics, some deep and soulful singing and gentle and quiet piano sound actually made everyone's heart gradually calm down.It was as if everyone was quietly listening to the unwilling murmur of the boy whose love was one-sided.When the last key fell, the venue was still silent.Then, the live broadcast room exploded:\"This version is so strong!\"\"It actually sounds soooooooooooooooo good.\"\"His singing is actually not very strong, but it was different from some performances where I hated why there was no fast-forward button at the beginning of the show. I finished listening to it before I even knew it!\"\"Maybe he is a hidden big vocal!\"The first performance of Jian Xingsui was really a very simple singing, a little restrained, as if he was really running away with 20,000 yuan after that performance. But at this moment, the person sitting in front of the piano, the spotlight of the stage was on him, and he was the master of that stage. He was also the focus of everyone's eyes.After the performance, Teacher Li said with a smile, \"Okay, Zhou Xun, please come on stage. We will re-evaluate Jian Xingsui's rating, please wait a moment.\"When the mentors discussed with each other, everyone was nervous.This seemed to be a counterattack and it seemed to concern everyone's heartstrings. Some people were guessing whether Jian Xingsui will be promoted to B, and some people were guessing whether Zhou Xun could be promoted in the end.\u00a0The mentors on the mentor's platform were also discussing, and the smile on Tuya's face did not stop. When he had first performed on the stage, she had thought that Jian Xingsui's singing ability could be given to B.\u00a0Now that he was so dazzling, Tuya seemed to have straightened her waist.The discussion took more than five minutes, and when the discussion was over, everyone's hearts clenched.The contestants' grades were announced by either Teacher Li or by Tuya. But this time, Fu Jinxiao was the one who picked up the mic.\u00a0He had once announced that Jian Xingsui could only get a B. But now when he was looking at the person standing on the stage, that pair of amorous phoenix eyes had a shallow smile in it which made people unable to see his real emotion. At that moment, he opened his lips: \"You Guess, do you think you will succeed in this challenge?\"Jian Xingsui didn't dare to guess. He was a little nervous.Holding the microphone and taking a deep breath, he replied in a low voice, \"I hope I can.\"\"Well.\" The smile in Fu Jinxiao's eyes deepened and his voice reached everyone's ears through the microphone: \"Congratulations, Jian Xingsui, the final result of your challenge reassessment is A.\"...............................................................The author has something to say:Film emperor Fu: \"My husband deserves nothing less than A!!!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Jian Xingsui's grade was announced, there was an uproar in the audience.He actually got a straight-up A!!!!!! What level was this?!!! It was terribly hard to get that grade!!! Moreover, he got that grading through the unanimous decision of the mentors. Besides, this person can't even dance!\u00a0On this basis, getting an A was enough to show the strength of this person's singing.The audiences were also shocked:\"It's A!!!\"\"What kind of counter-attack script is this??!!\"\"Hahahaha, I have always liked this little brother very much.\"Jian Xingsui's hand holding the microphone was a little unstable. He bowed deeply and thanked his mentors. He couldn't believe his rating. The moment he looked down from the stage, he saw the mentors looking at him with a smile. Seeing the admiration and envy of the other contestants towards him, for a moment, he was in a trance like an illusion.Did he just really do it?Even if he was just a small cannon fodder, could he actually get an A?Fu Jinxiao said, \"Come here.\"The actor's deep voice awakened Jian Xingsui from his trance. He hurriedly walked over and saw Fu Jinxiao and Tuya standing up together. The blonde beauty also had a warm smile on her face: \"I knew you could.\"Jian Xingsui smiled shyly.When little buzz head was happy, he looked a little silly. But it also gave people a kind of cute feeling.Tuya gently took off the C card from his waist. She raised her head and said to Jian Xingsui, \"Congratulations on saying goodbye to C, you have successfully advanced.\"Jian Xingsui stumbled a bit and said, \"It's all thanks to my mentors.\"Tuya stepped back gently. Fu Jinxiao was standing behind her. The film emperor was tall and straight.\u00a0He was standing under the spotlight and was looking at Jian Xingsui quietly. That handsome face had a shallow smile that he always had. But this time, he opened his lips and called his name: \"Jian Xingsui.\"Jian Xingsui's heart tightened: \"Yes\"\"Congratulations.\" Fu Jinxiao took a step forward. His slender hand was holding a sticker with a golden A written on it. The actor bent down and hung it up for Jian Xingsui. Then he straightened up again. He raised his eyelids to look at him and said,\u00a0\"No one helped you through this. You won it yourself. This card rewards you for facing challenges bravely.\"Next to Tuya, he said warmly, \"I will reward you for being innovative and not afraid of difficulties.\"Mr. Li, who was beside him, joked, \"But it's also a reward you earned through hard work.\"He didn't know why Jian Xingsui's nose was sour when he heard those simple sentences. He nodded lightly and bowed deeply.There was roaring applause from the audience, and he stepped off the stage.In the next few rounds of competition, there were winners and losers. Some of them were successfully promoted to Group B, but there was absolutely no one from grade C who was advanced to A. Jian Xingsui's success had become kind of unrepeatable.Then everyone went to sleep at night. Just when many people were immersed in the sweet dreams of the theme song, when everyone was sleeping soundly and woke up the next morning to face a new and hopeful day, a broadcast sounded:\u00a0\"Please come to the training room to gather, we will announce the theme song assessment project.\"Everyone woke up like they were still in a dream. Some even rolled and climbed off the bed.After arriving in the training room, many people were still yawning, as if they had not woken up yet. Then eventually after seeing the camera, some people were awake.Standing on the stage were several mentors.Obviously, they had finished the recording together last night, and those mentors had gotten up earlier than any of them today, but at this moment, everyone standing on the stage was neatly dressed and in high spirits. Fu Jinxiao on the stage lightly swept a glance at everyone.\u00a0His eyes fell on a few yawning people and there was a faint smile on the corner of his mouth. His smile seemed to be easy-going and nice but it made Jian Xingsui feel a little ominous in his heart.Sure enough, Fu Jinxiao picked up the microphone: \"Now, I'll start to announce the rules for the theme song assessment.\"Mr. Li spoke next to him: \"Even if all the contestants from class A are considered to be the centers, it is necessary to decide the exact center position among you guys.\u00a0Our rule is that within three days, there are no restrictions on your practice methods, duration, and standards. You will be able to act and learn freely. \"If it was just as good as what the mentors said, everyone will from now on believe in ghosts.Sure enough, before the others were happy, they heard Tuya say: \"However, our assessment criteria is that whoever is the first to fully interpret the theme song by themselves will become the center of our theme song. I repeat whoever will be the first one to fully and nicely interpret the song by themselves will become the center of our theme song.\"BY THEMSELVES??? Miss Tuya please admit you're lying, PLEASE!!!Fu Jinxiao's thin lips parted lightly: \"At the same time, the contestant who will win the center position of the theme song will also have the right to choose the song on the stage, and the right to choose the teammates. \"There was an uproar in the audience.Mentor Liu Shuang also said: \"Please note that the positions of everyone in our theme song assessment are arranged according to the position you get on the performance test.\u00a0Also, don't think that you can get the center position just because you are the first to finish interpreting the song. Our rule is that the song and dance of the theme song must be fully and excellently displayed. So only the contestant who will excellently interpret the theme song first will be our center.\"Teacher Li also nodded: \"Yes! Also please pay attention, if you want to rely on luck, and say you just want to try and perform once, if it works, you will get the position and if not there's nothing you'll lose, you'll try next time, then, I can tell you, there is only one chance.\u00a0If you become unsuccessful this time, you will be eliminated directly regardless of your A grade. You will not be able to participate in the mv recording of the theme song. \"It meant if they finished interpreting the song first but still, it wasn't good enough, then they were in danger. Whatsmore? If they'll act hurriedly to become the first to submit their performance but their performance won't meet the criteria, they will have to say bye bye to this cruel show!All the contestants were shocked.The rules of this year's season were too cruel. It seemed as if they were trying to make it clear that they will not urge you to practice. You could act freely these three days~But in fact, if you are lazy, other hard-working people will learn before you. The position and camera shots they will obtain will be better than yours.\u00a0Especially for everyone in Class A, whoever successfully performs first will get a central position and a generous reward.In short, once you act lazy and don't practice even for just a moment, then you are over!!!For a while, everyone in Class A looked at each other, and saw fighting spirit and hostility in each other's eyes.Shen Xingchen smiled: \"Okay, this rule, to put it bluntly, is actually going to be a battle with more than 100 people. It's exciting, I like it.\"In the last challenge, An Ran had also entered Class A.Hearing this, he said softly, \"Everyone, please focus mainly on friendship first and competition second. Just do your best.\"Shen Xingchen raised his eyebrows and said, \"Then can you give me the center position for the sake of friendship?\"An Ran stopped talking.When Jian Xingsui saw this scene, he didn't know why he wanted to laugh.Under the mentor's order, the theme song was also shown on the big screen. What made many people headache was that the song was mixed in Chinese and English. The lyrics were very broken, and the dance movements were too difficult.Some contestants had already cried:\"....................How, Why, What is happening?\"\"Three days??? I don't think even ten days will be enough for me to dance well in this damn song.\"\"Help me!!!\"The whining sound slowly spread throughout the training room.Standing at the front, Fu Jinxiao slowly pressed the timer. He took the microphone and slowly announced: \"The game starts now!\"As if they were robots, everyone at the same time, dispersed collectively. The contestants of Class A found the centralized training room of Class A and started to practice dancing. The program team did not prepare a dance teacher for them. They had to learn everything by watching on the screen over and over again.The first thing they had to do was to memorize the lyrics.But this alone made it difficult for many people. The audiences saw too many contestants collapse and complain:\"These lyrics are really hard to memorize. I haven't memorized it even though I've practiced it since morning.\"\"It's complicated and hard to remember.\"\"I think I'm going crazy ah.\"Compared with the complaints of other classes, Class A seemed very silent. Most of the people squatted there and memorized the lyrics. Shen Xingchen's memory was relatively poor. He recited lyrics all the time, even when he went to the toilet or to drink water.At noon, Jian Xingsui said, \"Let's go to eat lunch.\"Shen Xingchen shook his head: \"Just bring me a little.\"Jian Xingsui couldn't do anything, so he helped him get a little bit of food.\u00a0The young master had a poor memory. He didn't memorize the lyrics until the afternoon. After he recited it, he began to practice dancing.\u00a0He had been in constant motion all afternoon, constantly adjusting his posture to the songs on the screen to train, to better perfect the stage.Jian Xingsui had a good memory and could already remember the lyrics in the morning. However, he did not have a strong foundation in dancing, so many of his movements were incoherent and stiff. But Shen Xingchen, who only remembered the lyrics in the afternoon, was able to smooth it out in the evening.Not only Jian Xingsui, but even the audience sighed:\"This brother Shen is really trying too hard.\"\"I saw almost all of the contestants resting but I didn't see him resting.\"\"The first candidate to compete for the center position still hasn't come out yet.\"It's not that no one could compete in class A. Those who could enter this class were all capable, but no one wanted to take risks. After all, once they do not meet the standards, they cannot participate in the MV shooting. This risk was too great, and no one wanted to take it.The contestant who competed with Shen Xingchen and all of the class A contestants the most was Li Xu'an. This person also came from a big brokerage company, and he was very talented in singing and dancing. For some reason, Jian Xingsui felt that Shen Xingchen seemed to be having a beef with this person. Because when Shen Xingchen had learned that Li Xu'an was also fighting for this center position, he was determined to win.At four o'clock in the morning, most of the people were dying.Jian Xingsui came over to Shen Xingchen: \"Brother Chen, go to bed, you can't practice anymore.\"The young master, who had not rested much all day, got several pieces of his dancing T-shirt wet. He had just finished the dance practice and shook his head gently: \"I won't sleep.\"But it was obvious to the naked eye that his energy level was very poor.Jian Xingsui even felt that him being in such a state, he might make mistakes when he went to the mentors for the assessment performance. Then all of his hard work will be utterly useless.Jian Xingsui whispered, \"You know what? Li Xu'an went to bed.\"Shen Xingchen frowned and looked around the practice room, surprised: \"Did he really go to bed?\"\"Of course it's true.\" Jian Xingsui chuckled: \"You go too, just sleep for a while. If you're afraid of being late, set an alarm clock.\"Shen Xingchen shook his head: \"No! I won't sleep.\"Jian Xingsui sighed inwardly. He leaned closer and said, \"Then you two are about the same level. Li Xu'an has already gone to bed. If you win, people will say that you could only win by practicing while Li Xuan was sleeping. Then again, if you'll lose, people will say that you couldn't even beat a sleeping person, so you deserved that. \"Shen Xingchen was a little persuaded.The body of a person who had been tired all day had reached its peak. In fact, he also wanted to sleep very much. After hesitating for a while, he finally nodded: \"Then I will only sleep for two hours, and I will wake up when the time comes.\"Jian Xingsui said softly, \"Okay.\"After returning to the dormitory with Shen Xingchen, Shen Xingchen fell asleep, but Jian Xingsui didn't take advantage of the situation to sleep in the bedroom. In fact, he had never wanted to fight for the center position. He did not choose to sleep but returned to the training room.Some viewers in the live broadcast room laughed:\"What a scheming lad. He persuaded others to sleep but he himself did not sleep.\"\"I didn't expect you to be such a person.\"\"You are too scheming.\"However, while everyone was watching the excitement, Jian Xingsui didn't insist on practicing. He squatted against the wall of the training room's corridor and slept.......Everyone who looked at the behavior of this strange lad on the screen was dumbfounded. What was this for?In fact, the corridor was very noisy. He will be woken up from time to time when people pass by.\u00a0For people who have been busy all day, being woken up every five or six minutes is a hell of torture, but Jian Xingsui didn't move from the door.Just when the audience was wondering, there were also people watching that scene inside the Shen family's mansion.Mother Shen knew the character of her youngest son. So tonight she had specially put on the show to see her son's performance. She had originally focused all her attention on her child, but unexpectedly, she was attracted by another one.Father Shen, Shen Kangcheng, came over with sleepiness: \"Madam, why are you still awake?\"The beautiful lady sitting on the sofa shook her head gently: \"I'm watching Xingchen's show. This child has been up all night. Thanks to a teammate who is taking care of him in class A, otherwise I don't know what Xingchen would have been like.\"Shen Kangcheng leaned over and said, \"Who?\"The lady Xu Enzhen pointed at the screen with a fair finger: \"It's this child.\"\"Why is he sleeping at the door?\" Mr. Shen frowned: \"This child, how can he choose this kind of place to sleep?\"Xu Enzhen really didn't know why, in fact, she was not familiar with Jian Xingsui, but she was inexplicably concerned, so she whispered: \"He is the child who is taking care of our Xingchen, and he persuaded Xingchen to go to bed but he himself didn't sleep there.\u00a0Instead, he came to the door to sleep. No one can guess the reason, but I have a rough guess...\"President Shen: \"What?\"\"He's guarding Xingchen.\" Xu Enzhen didn't know why, but when she said this, she felt a little bit of pain, but also with a little pity: \"Because he's afraid that the contestant who is competing with Xingchen will wake up and will come over to prepare for the performance, or to practice more, so he stayed at the door. As long as that contestant doesn't come, he will let Xingchen sleep for a while, and if he does, he can call Xingchen right away.\"+In order to help his friends, he would rather sacrifice his sleep, squat at the door, and not sleep all night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you like this novel, then please support the author at jjwxc.I'm so sleepy. I sacrificed my game time to release this chapter.On a side note, our ML is really the most ideal type of ML I could ever ask for. He is fucking MYSTERIOUS AND FUCKING DANGEROUS. But at the same time the most FUCKING CARING person ever!!! I repeat, the most caring person in this entire world!!! He only has a soft spot for his guy!!!And then comes our MC. I have never met a single character as relatable as this one. While reading other novels, I always think of what I would have done if I was in that character's position. But while reading this, I always feel like this character is me myself. And no he is not a coward at all, he has just seen life from so near that he knows the consequences of his single-action clearly. He had lost his everything in his past life including himself, so now in this life, he wants nothing more than a life. Yeah, not a perfect or even a good life. He just wants to live....that's all!...................................................When the rest of class A contestants started to come back one after another, Jian Xingsui went back to the dormitory to call.Shen Xingchen slept for more than two and a half hours. After seeing the time, he glanced at Jian Xingsui: \"Why didn't the alarm clock sound?\"\"They just got up, you still have time.\" Jian Xingsui brought him water: \"You've been practicing for a whole day. Not sleeping much.....are you trying to know what it feels like to faint in front of the mentors?\"Shen Xingchen took a sip of water and looked at him, and said strangely, \"Why are you so lucky? You just woke up at the same time when they woke up.\"Jian Xingsui smiled and said nothing.Shen Xingchen continued to drink two sips of water and suddenly stopped drinking. He seemed to have suddenly reacted. He slowly put down the hand holding the water glass and stared at Jian Xingsui with his dark eyes. He then asked: \"You didn't sleep?\"Jian Xingsui said quickly, \"I fell asleep. I really fell asleep.\"Shen Xingchen couldn't believe it: \"Why is your bed still neat?\"\"I practiced for a while in the training room.\" Jian Xingsui looked at the watch on the wall: \"It seems that it is five o'clock now. You go to training hall first, I will sleep for a while.\"Shen Xingchen guessed that someone was going to perform in front of the mentors at this point, and asked him, \"Aren't you going to compete?\"\"I have no foundation in dancing. I only learned half of the movements yesterday, and now half of my limbs are also out of coordination. So I can't compete with others even if I don't sleep now.\"Class A alone had five or six dancers. Even in Class B, there were also a few who studied dance all year round.Jian Xingsui knew that he was definitely incompetent, so he never thought of overdoing it: \"I just tried to practice in the training room, and found that my mind was muddy. I couldn't even remember the lyrics, so I'm going to sleep for a while. You hurry up and go to the training hall. I'll wait for your good news.\"After he said that, Shen Xingchen left still in doubt.In the same dormitory were Ning Ze and Wen Shengge who had slept for a while at night. Both of them were from Class B. Wen Shengge and Ning Ze could also sing, but they both had some basic dance skills. So both of them got up now and went back to the training room with Shen Xingchen.Shen Xingchen walked in the corridor when he went out, and sighed softly, \"I don't know why, but after a good night's sleep, the lyrics are much clearer, and I don't even feel tired anymore.\"Wen Shengge smiled softly: \"Of course, you must rest. Without sleep, you'll be in difficulties.\"Ning Ze had always been reluctant to talk, so he nodded: \"Well, Jian Xingsui was right to persuade you.\"\"We actually wanted to persuade you too, but it was useless.\" Wen Shengge covered his lips: \"Xing Sui had a nice way to persuade you.\"Shen Xingchen sneered: \"He persuaded me. But when I went to bed, he was practicing in the training room.\"The group went to the training room of their respective classes. Shen Xingchen went to the hall and found that several other people were indeed there. The overall atmosphere of class A was not particularly harmonious. Even a small group was formed among the people who didn't know each other till yesterday. An Ran and Li Xu'an only met yesterday, and today they were calling each other ''true'' brothers. They were practicing in front of the mirror and when they saw Shen Xingchen come in, they didn't speak.Shen Xingchen was too lazy to pay attention to them.He looked into the mirror and followed the music himself. Yesterday morning, he had felt very tired, and the lyrics sometimes broke, but after sleeping for more than two hours, he seemed to have completely memorized it.\u00a0And he wasn't tired at all, and his spirit was very good. After finishing it, Shen Xingchen looked at himself in the mirror and was glad that he went to sleep.An Ran came over and said, \"Brother Xingchen, you dance very well.\"Shen Xingchen replied lightly. In fact, An Ran was very beautiful and delicate, and he always spoke softly and was also very good at doing things. In fact, he was the type that the Shen Xingchen liked. But he didn't know why Jian Xingsui was always trying to avoid An Ran. He even seemed a little afraid of him. That made Shen Xingchen always want to kick the intestine out of this An Ran. It was unknown why but this An Ran had become the definition of ''disgusting'' for Shen Xingchen from their first meeting.An Ran smiled: \"Did Xingsui return to the dormitory to rest?\"Shen Xingchen said, \"En.\"\"Ohhh, I also think he should have gone back to the dormitory to sleep. What was he sleeping at the door for?\" An Ran pouted: \"He doesn't feel sorry for himself at all.\" (T/N: This An Ran really makes me feel....................)Shen Xingchen's movements stopped, he looked sideways at An Ran in disbelief: \"What did you just say?\"An Ran was taken aback by Shen Xingchen's sudden louder voice. After a long while, he hesitantly said, \"I..... I didn't say anything. It was Xingsui who was sleeping at the door, and then when he saw me and brother Xu'an coming, he was gone.\"......Shen Xingchen lowered his head. It was unknown what he was thinking.An Ran wondered: \"Brother Xingchen, what's wrong with you?\"When Shen Xingchen raised his head again, his eyes were a little red. Big Brother, who had always been ready to throw people to the drainage was actually a little bit defensive here. Thinking of that buzz head idiot, his nose was sore. He held back the urge to go back to the dormitory and cursed lowly.An Ran was still wondering when he saw Shen Xingchen walking outside: \"Brother, where are you going?\"Shen Xingchen didn't turn his head back: \"I'll go to the mentors to perform!\"At 5:41 in the morning, it was just dawn. The sun still hadn't risen from the horizon and there were very few viewers in the live broadcast room of \"Starlight\". But at this time, the first student knocked on the door of the mentor's room. Shen Xingchen walked in without the slightest hesitation. It took him far less than 24 hours of singing and dancing practice of the theme song to kick off.......At seven o'clock in the morning, Jian Xingsui was awakened from his sleep. In other words, he was forced to wake up.There was a vicious man sitting beside his bed: \"Get up, you fuck shit, you dirty scheming scoundrel...........are you kidding my fart? Still sleeping after acting like a fuckboy in front of Lao Zi? Wake up you asshole!!! The dormitory on this entire floor is empty. Everyone has gone to the training room. Are you still sleeping because you want to fight me?\"Probably the sleep time was close to being three hours. But Jian Xingsui, who was in two hours of light sleep, swayed and opened his eyes. After seeing Shen Xingchen, he quickly woke up and asked, \"Xingchen, why are you here? ...have you performed?\"Shen Xingchen snorted. The young master raised his head proudly: \"Who is this young master, what is there that Lao Zi can't pass?\"Jian Xingsui paused for a while, then smiled happily: \"That's great.......then you are the center... Are you the center?\"Shen Xingchen: \"What a pig head, you.... who else is it if it's not me?\"Jian Xingsui's smile grew even bigger. He had watched Shen Xingchen practice singing and dancing without sleep, watching him wet several T-shirts with sweat, watching him practice with sore muscles but still persevering.\u00a0Now, his buddy has really got the center position. For some reason, Jian Xingsui couldn't help but feel his nose sour. He whispered: \"It's really great. Congratulations, you got the center position. Big brother is so cool and handsome...\"The camera in the dormitory was on and many viewers also had woken up at this time. Some of them had also seen this scene by replaying the scenes they hadn't watched while they were still sleeping. Seeing this scene, they were inexplicably emotionally infected:\"Ah, ah, my family's children, I feel so distressed.\"\"Suichen is real!\" (T/N: LOL NOOOOOO They are brothers....real brothers!!!)\"20,000 yuan Cinderella and the rich young master, I'll pay respects first.\"\"Don't mess around with CPs, okay? This is a pure brotherhood, hehe.\"In the dormitory, Shen Xingchen saw Jian Xingsui's that appearance and he felt uncomfortable. He pulled Jian Xingsui and said, \"What a bastard, get up for me and go to dance practice.\"Jian Xingsui slowly got up: \"I know.\"When he returned to the training room, Shen Xingchen personally taught him dance and movements, but the young master was short-tempered.\u00a0After teaching for a while, he became impatient and went to the cafeteria to eat, so Jian Xingsui practiced in the training room by himself. It happened that Wen Shengge and Ning Ze were all free, so they came over to continue teaching him.\u00a0An Ran and Zhou Xun were also practicing on the other side of the training room.While a group of people was practicing, the door of the training room was opened. It was unknown who had looked at the door first and shouted in surprise, \"Brother Fu!\"Fu Jinxiao stood at the door. Today, he was wearing black casual sportswear, which was not so formal. His aura was relaxed, but the fact that he was standing there alone made the young trainees nervous.A group of people spontaneously stood in a line and said obediently, \"Hello, Mentor Fu!\"Fu Jinxiao responded lightly. He came over and half leaned against the wall of the training room, raising his eyebrows to look at everyone: \"How is your practice going? One day has already passed.\"All the trainees had different answers:\"It's almost done.\"\"I'm not very familiar with it yet.\"\"There are some places that don't work.\"''I don't even know why I'm here in the first place.''''Where am I?''''Fuck, I want to go back to where my ancestors originated from. This place is scary. MOMMM!''Of course, these were the things they could never say in front of their idol. They could only perfunctorily answer positively.Fu Jinxiao said, \"Well, come and show me.\"It was definitely beneficial to be able to dance and be instructed in front of the master mentor. It was equivalent to taking an exam in advance. Everyone was very happy, and they went to take their positions spontaneously. When the music started, they also started to dance together.\u00a0The person standing at the front was An Ran. He was the one who learned the fastest and danced the best in this group. He should have been praised. However, what was surprising was that when the dance was halfway through, the name which was in Fu Jinxiao's mouth still was: \"Jian Xingsui, what are you doing?\"In the last row, Jian Xingsui, who couldn't keep up with the beat, was pitifully continuing his dance.When everyone started dancing because the person behind was indeed a person who had no foundation in dancing at all and was incomparable with other people who had dance foundation, it caused Fu Jinxiao's knife-like eyes to keep falling on Jian Xingsui.\u00a0After the music ended, Fu Jinxiao stood up. The air pressure in the room was freezing because of the actor's mood. However, instead of losing his temper, he smiled with his lips hooked. This smile made everyone's back cold: \"Jian Xingsui.\"Jian Xingsui weakly said, \"Yes.\"\"How do you think you danced?\"\"I couldn't keep up with the tempo.\"\"No, you weren't unable to keep up with the tempo.\" Fu Jinxiao's voice was elegant and gentle, but what he said was ironic: \"You don't know what is tempo at all.\"Everyone in the room looked at Jian Xingsui. Some were worried while some were looking for a great show.Just when everyone thought Film Emperor Fu was going to get angry, he walked to the wall behind Jian Xingsui and said, \"Without the background music, show me the movements from the beginning and I'll see.\"Jian Xingsui was so scared that his legs had turned weak, but he didn't dare to disobey Fu Jinxiao's order. So he bit his teeth and started dancing.Fu Jinxiao watched a bit and then opened his lips: \"You are so weak that you can only move so softly?\"Jian Xingsui had no foundation in dancing. His movements were actually very big, but he couldn't feel the strength, which looked strange. He weakly said, \"I don't know how to use my strength to control my movements.\"Fu Jinxiao picked up a bottle of mineral water on the table next to him. He walked over and stretched out his hand. \"Bang!\" A loud noise resounded in the practice room. The man looked sideways at Jian Xingsui: \"Come here and shake it.\"Jian Xingsui hurried over and shook the water bottle.Fu Jinxiao said, \"Shaking hands like that, aren't you capable of doing even such kind of small movements?? The strength of your shaking arms is like others' strength while tickling people. Why? Are you still only going to sing a big show for us later?\"Jian Xingsui blushed when he was mercilessly lectured. He hurriedly said, \"I see, I'll try again.\"When Film emperor Fu spoke, no one dared to speak in the entire training room. The other trainees didn't even dare to move, all watching Jian Xingsui being trained alone.Jian Xingsui tried a set of movements twice according to the method taught by Fu Jinxiao, and he actually felt a sense of strength.Fu Jinxiao's brows and eyes loosened a lot, and he raised his eyebrows: \"Aren't you able to control your strength now??\"Jian Xingsui could also dance this part before, but that dance looked very strange. Fu Jinxiao only taught him it two or three times. And in less than five minutes, when Jian Xingsui danced to this dance again, both visually and rhythmically, it was smoother and more beautiful.Zhou Xun, who was not far away, leaned into An Ran's ear and said, \"Jian Xingsui, this idiot, is so useless in front of Brother Fu. He is shaming himself to death. In the future, he will definitely not be liked by our dear Brother Fu.\"Zhou Xun was being happy about his enemy's misfortune, but An Ran's face was a little dull. He said softly, \"Ah xun, if you think so, you are wrong.\"Zhou Xun was taken aback.\"If Brother Fu really doesn't like him, he won't point out his problems, and teach him personally.\" An Ran looked sideways:\u00a0\"When dancing just now, including me and you, and even others, there were problems to varying degrees, but you see who has caught Brother Fu's eyes and who is being taught from just beginning to now?\"Fu Jinxiao was indeed looking like he was angry, but anyone with eyes could see that it was the kind of anger that arise when you don't get something expected from your beloved person! Otherwise, other people were making mistakes too. Some of them had even greater problems with their movements than Jian Xingsui. Then why wasn't Fu Jinxiao angry with them?It was because, since the beginning, the Film Emperor Fu only had his eyes on that single person. Other individuals had never entered his sight at all!On the surface, he seemed to be fierce, but it was as if the parents were being fierce when they found out that their child was actually at the bottom of the exam, but they were still trying to teach their children after the fierceness.In the whole training room, Jian Xingsui who was the most hated one was someone who was most liked and loved by...........one could guess by whom! It looked like the suffering one was Jian Xingsui, but the actual winner among all of them was none other than himself.Fu Jinxiao's eyes were clearly saying: My goal isn't to give you the world through fake kindness, it's to conquer the world with you through my true self. That's the reason, I'm me, only when I'm with you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAn Ran was not the only one who felt this way.The audience in the live broadcast room also followed the suit to comment:\"What a handsome mentor and trainee pair.\"''I saw the fear of being lectured by the parents in buzz head brother's eyes.\"\"He looks fierce, but in fact, he is helping 20,000 to smooth out his movements.\"\"My brother is showing his hidden tenderness, uwu my brother Fu.\"After Jian Xingsui reluctantly smoothed out the whole set of movements, Fu Jinxiao was a little satisfied. He then opened his lips: \"Your problem is that you can't control your strength. An Ran and Ning Ze's strength is very good, you should practice by looking at them more.\"Jian Xingsui froze when he heard An Ran's name.Sure enough, the protagonist Shou and the protagonist Gong will still be attracted to each other, right? He was so stupid and he couldn't even dance well. What was he even expecting! Thinking about being compared with An Ran, he felt even more stupid.Jian Xingsui restrained the thoughts in his eyes and said softly, \"I see.\"His foundation was really too shallow. Even if he tried to hide it, his thoughts were almost written on his face. What kind of old fox was Fu Jinxiao? He raised his eyebrows: \"Don't want to?\"How dare Jian Xingsui? He hurriedly said: \"No! I'll practice more by looking at them!\"Fu Jinxiao hooked his lips.\u00a0Looking at the small appearance of the little buzz head's panic explanation was really cute. He didn't know why, in fact, everyone here was smarter than Jian Xingsui and more capable than him.\u00a0But maybe it was because people like this have been in contact with him too much. So people like little buzz head, who are a bit silly and sincere, would inexplicably make people look at them a few more times. But then again, he also didn't like other sincere people at all. It was him......just him.Like......... when did it start?Maybe he was interested in this boy because of the contrast between the him in the cake shop that day and the him in front of himself. This little buzz head obviously was so seriously defending him outside the rice cake shop, but after meeting him, he cowardly hides again and again, right?The Film emperor Fu usually had a good reputation in the entertainment industry. He seems to be a good person, but in fact, he is really bad in his bones.For example, when he sees an honest child aka Jian Xingsui, he wants to make fun of him.\"It's understandable even if you don't want to learn by looking at them.\" Fu Jinxiao's tone was joking: \"After all, if the student I have personally taught still looked up to others to learn, isn't that an insult to me?\"......The other trainees were amused.Before, Jian Xingsui who had no background and no name, was not welcomed by everyone. But when Film emperor Fu came over tonight, even if he just had a few words with Jian Xingsui, the attitude of others towards Jian Xingsui was not the same cold.Someone even took the initiative to come over:\"Sui Sui, ask me if you don't understand anything.\"\"Yes, we can teach you.\"\"Sui Sui, do you want to practice together for a while?\"Jian Xingsui couldn't handle it. He originally was not someone who was good at communicating with people, so he didn't know what to do. He could only continue to thank them and thus have a deeper understanding of the snobbery and truth of this group.Although Film emperor Fu had helped him a lot, for Jian Xingsui, who had no foundation in dancing, even if he had gotten special training, in the short term, relying on only passion to dance better was obviously completely unworkable.\u00a0In the afternoon, he entered the performance hall and started the theme song assessment. He barely passed, and finally got a 62nd grade, which was on a par in the entire variety show.The selection of other contestants was also completed. On the night of the completion, everyone was looking forward to a public selection, and it was finally time for that.Mr. Li said earlier: \"It's like this, our rule for selecting songs will be carried out according to the ranking of the theme song assessment that we finished earlier. The first-ranked person has the right to choose and can designate a teammate to be his own teammate. Then others will be able to choose songs in order.\"Tuya held a card next to him and said, \"Next, please watch the big screen and choose your songs.\"Everyone's eyes looked forward, watching all the songs displayed on the big screen in turn. The first song was a cool and crazy song, and it was the style of some cool buddies.Jian Xingsui said to Shen Xingchen, \"It's your style.\"Shen Xingchen shook his head. Big Brother Shen had always been a willful teenager, and what he wanted had never been defined: \"This is the kind of song I chose on the first stage, I want to change it this time.\"Next, the songs were of various styles. However, the styles of cool and swaggy songs were similar. But there were many people who wanted to choose those types because everyone wants to look cool and be handsome in front of the audience and attract fans.Wen Shengge came over and asked, \"Xing Sui, which one do you want to choose?\"\"Me?\" Jian Xingsui was stunned for a while, then replied, \"I am okay with anyone, actually.\"The other contestants were actively discussing which song they must choose. Only Jian Xingsui was the most Buddhist(referring to how calm he was) here. And the camera was just in front of him at this moment as if the program team knew that Jian Xingsui would definitely give everyone a good scene.The audience in the live broadcast room also hahahaed:\"As expected of my 20,000 brother.\"\"You are destined to die. Who cares about choosing a mere song in this mortal world.\"\"I'm so pissed off, you lazy old dude. Don't even think about getting the 20,000 so easily!\"Just when the track was put on the last song, Jian Xingsui, who was always indifferent, suddenly showed an interested expression. He said, \"This is not bad.\"The song being played was \"Youth China\".This song was actually a bit old-fashioned, with the spirit of a hero and a scholar, and the style of this song was also different from his first stage performance. So it should have a different style and presentation as well.Shen Xingchen nodded: \"It is indeed good.\"When all the songs were played, Mr. Li said, \"Okay, if everyone has selected the songs, they can come over.\"The first place was of course Shen Xingchen, no doubt about it.The first song in the playlist was of a swaggy and cool style, and it was also the most popular song among all the contestants. All contestants thought that Shen Xingchen would choose this, but what was surprising was that Shen Xingchen actually ran directly to \"Youth China\".When he stood there, he surprised everyone.Teacher Li showed an unexpected smile, and then said, \"Okay, Xingchen chose this song, so who is the teammate you want to choose?\"The contestants below were very nervous.Actually, this song was also very popular, and many people wanted to choose it. But there were only five seats in this song, so the position was very tight.Shen Xingchen crossed the crowd, looked at Jian Xingsui, and said loudly, \"Would you like to come over!\"Before Jian Xingsui was worried that he would not be able to choose this song. He smiled now: \"Yes!\"The two of them stood together and it was time for the others to choose songs. To Jian Xingsui's surprise, An Ran actually chose this song.An Ran had a delicate appearance, so it was very reasonable for him to choose traditional songs.He came over and smiled and said, \"Please give me more advice.\"Different from the top-ranking this time, An Ran's good friend Zhou Xun's ranking was also relatively low. Of course, as An Ran's No. 1 follower, he also wanted to join this team, but when it was Zhou Xun's turn, the place was already full.An Ran asked the mentor softly: \"Teacher, I'm also from Class A. Do I have the right to choose a teammate?\"According to the rules, Class A actually had this privilege.Teacher Li said: \"Of course, you can, but in a team, only one person can exercise this privilege. Before you, Shen Xingchen has already exercised it, unless he is willing to let it go, or Jian Xingsui is willing to let it go.\"An Ran and Zhou Xun set their eyes on the two of them.Shen Xingchen sneered, \"I don't want to.\"Before this, Jian Xingsui didn't want to endure conflict with the protagonist. So he would definitely have agreed to back down, but this time, it was his good buddy who won him this chance for him. And now if he backed down, won't he be a loser and ignorant ass?So Jian Xingsui also shook his head: \"No.\"An Ran looked at Zhou Xun pitifully: \"I'm sorry, Brother Xun, in fact, I also wanted you to join our team, but it doesn't seem to work now...\"Zhou Xun sighed: \"It's okay Ran Ran, you did your best.\"In the live broadcast room, this scene was also broadcasted live. At the same time, the Jian family, who had just finished watching the live broadcast, also saw this scene.Father Jian, Jian Kuo frowned and said, \"Isn't this Suisui?\"The elder brother Jian Gu, who was sitting next to him, also looked at the words and confirmed, \"Well, it is indeed him.\"\"Two days ago, I didn't watch the live broadcast because I was busy with the company. I heard from you that he also participated in this show. Didn't your second brother contact the show team to swipe him down, why is he still there? ?\" Jian Kuo looked at the screen where Jian Xingsui rejected An Ran again, and An Ran looked aggrieved: \"I thought he had finally changed his personality, but the result is still the same. He can't even dance, can't he choose other songs? Pretender!\"Jian Gu also frowned.Sitting across from the two of them was the second son of the Jian family, Jian Zhi. He was a popular star as well. This time, he finally went home and happened to hear his father and brother talking about this, so he said: \"I have long ago contacted the program team. They have told me that they will eliminate Jian Xingsui, don't worry.\"Jian Gu sighed: \"This suisui, when he had left home before, I thought he had changed his temper. Who knew, you see, he even chased after Ran Ran's variety show to make trouble. This kid is really someone who can't be taught! \"Jian Zhi also hated this ass deeply. He frowned when he heard the words: \"Don't worry, \"Starlight\" has already invited me to be a guest of their show. When the time comes, I will go there in person. If he dares to bully Ran Ran again, I will definitely make him look 'very good' in front of everyone.\"Others were relieved.On the other hand, Jian Xingsui had no idea that he had been targeted.The costumes for \"Youth China\" had been decided. It was a set of ink-colored ancient costumes. It was very beautiful and elegant. When it was sent out for everyone to try on the size, everyone was very happy.An Ran was the first to pass, and he even took the initiative to help Shen Xingchen: \"Brother Chen, here it is for you.\"Shen Xingchen answered lightly after taking it.Zhou Xun was a little unhappy when he saw that Shen Xingchen didn't even give a glance at An Ran even after getting help from him. But An Ran who was the party involved felt it was nothing. So he couldn't say anything. An Ran was a smart person, and of course, he was not as harmless as he seemed on the surface. After so many years in the rice cake shop, the biggest weapon he had learned was to be calm while facing all kinds of people.The Shen family behind Shen Xingchen was a top-tier wealthy family. Shen Xingxhen already had a fixed position in Starlight's planned debut. As a member of the upper class, he(ZX) must have a good relationship with him. He is confident that he is definitely much better than that idiot Jian Xingsui. And although a young master like Shen Xingchen seemed to have a bad temper, his mind was pure and simple, so he should be able to handle him well.He didn't believe that he would lose to that idiot.After Jian Xingsui got the clothes, he tried them on and they fit well. He wanted to try makeup and hair again. He tried wearing a wig. The makeup artist next to him said with a smile, \"I'll help you.\"The other team members also changed their clothes one after another and came out.They all wore similar clothes, and their makeup and hair were all handsome and elegant.They looked like handsome young masters and close buddies. Just when everyone was arranging themselves, the makeup artist suddenly said in surprise: \"Hey, did you guys notice something?\"Everyone else looked over.\"Xing Sui and Xing Chen..................you two look same!\"Before, one was a buzz head, the other was a spiky head.\u00a0They were also wearing clothes of different styles, which made the two people look less obvious. But after their hairstyle and clothes were almost the same, it was too obvious, especially the face and nose, which were exactly the same.Jian Xingsui was taken aback: \"Do we?\"Shen Xingchen was suspicious for a moment, then leaned over. The two stood in front of the mirror and looked at each other. The young master originally wanted to refute that they didn't look alike at all, but he was stunned when he saw the very similar facial features in the mirror, and he turned his head to look evilly at Jian Xingsui: \"We........we really look alike!!!\"The makeup artist covered her lips and smiled: \"It's like you guys are real brothers.\"The other team members also came over to cheer and laughed.Zhou Xun also sneered: \"They really look quite similar. This Jian Xingsui looks just like an illegitimate child, it's so funny.\"An Ran was the only one who was not very happy. His smile was relatively reluctant. He said softly: \"They don't look similar at all, hey let's not talk about this........\"...............................................................T/N: YO!!! Our An Ran seems to know something ah..........Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then you can go to the training room to practice dancing.\"Everyone complied.This time, there will be live audiences coming to the scene.\u00a0And many trainees' families belong to the relatively wealthy type.\u00a0Therefore, although it seemed that many audiences would come to the scene this time, in fact, many family members of trainees would be the ones to mostly come to the scene.\u00a0Before the official program started, there were already many people whispering about who would come over from their home this time.Jian Xingsui was practicing dance in the dance studio. His dance foundation was the worst, and he was also the student that the dance teacher paid the most attention to.\"Jian Xingsui, that movement is wrong.\"\"Slow, slow.\"\"Xing Sui, look here.\"After the other teammates finished, Jian Xingsui usually chose to stay in private to practice more.In fact, Jian Xingsui had felt guilty for dragging down his teammates' progress, so he always practiced until late every night. Even so, it was still somehow him dragging his teammates but his teammates were still good-natured and didn't blame him.On the third day of rehearsal, the captain held a small meeting.Shen Xingchen sat cross-legged in the middle, and he said, \"The lyrics of the song we chose are not bad, but the tune is a bit slow, which will limit our dance moves.\u00a0You have also noticed that these movements are relatively simple, and we will have no advantage compared to the frenetic dances of other groups. \"The other teammates also agreed.An Ran was very good at dancing this kind of national-style dance. He was able to do well himself, so he tentatively said: \"We can work harder and perform better. Then we will still be able to compare to other groups.\"Shen Xingchen had a fiery temper. What he was best at was giving replies to stupid people: \"Tell me which group on the stage won't perform 'better'. Now the main focus of the problem is not that at all.\"An Ran bowed his head a little aggrievedly, and looked pitiful: \"I just don't want everyone to be too pessimistic.\"Shen Xingchen didn't have time to talk to him now: \"Now is not the time to be pessimistic.\u00a0No matter how well we will perform in this song, it will not be as impressive as those of the other groups. In fact, I have an idea, Suisui, you could turn Zhou Xun's swaggy and passion full song into a love song on the first stage, then will you also be able to edit this song a little bit? \"Jian Xingsui never thought that Shen Xingchen would entrust such a heavy responsibility to himself.The other teammates also reacted after some time:\"Yes!\"\"Xing Sui, I still remember your arrangement of that song to this day!\"\"You are truly a god-level song reviser!\"\"Can you help us revise it?\"Jian Xingsui was stunned for a while. He didn't expect everyone to trust him. Before this, he was a drag, but now, he could actually contribute to the team.Seeing Jian Xingsui's hesitant appearance, An Ran said with a smile, \"Forget it, Suisui is also very busy practicing dancing every day, so don't make it difficult for him.\"Shen Xingchen asked Jian Xingsui directly, \"Can you do it?\"If he also had to revise the song while learning so much dancing at the same time, it was indeed a lot of work. Even if he refused to revise, others would not think there was any problem.However, Jian Xingsui was silent for a while and said, \"I can do it.\"Everyone else smiled, only An Ran's smile faded. He said, \"Xing Sui, then will you still have time to train yourself? Won't this delay you?\"1Of course, he knew Jian Xingsui's ability to arrange and edit music.If he was allowed to show it, would he still have room to shine?4Jian Xingsui said softly, \"My dance foundation is poor. Even if I practice again, it will be a drag on you guys. If I can edit the song to help the team, I'm willing.\"After saying this, Jian Xingsui secretly felt that his teammates who were silent before could not wait to slap him!Shen Xingchen came over and put his arm around Jian Xingsui's neck and said, \"What nonsense are you talking? Who is dragging whom? There is no such thing as losing in this young master's team, so hurry up and edit the song. Even it's for thousand days and nights, I will stay with you as long as you need me for practice.\"The other teammates also relieved their suspicions because of this conversation.\"We will also practice with you.\"\"Isn't it just not being able to dance, I'm very good at teaching it to others.\"\"Let's all practice with Suisui!\"Everyone gathered around, but An Ran was ignored in place.Obviously just a few days ago, because An Ran's national style dance was very good, everyone surrounded him and praised him. But now they suddenly regarded him as a transparent person, all revolving around Jian Xingsui.In a place that a group of people couldn't see, An Ran's always gentle face turned cold, and there was a sharp look in his eyes.......A few days later\u2014the day of the performance.The backstage of the program group was very lively. The contestants were basically ready and being prepared in the backstage. Because everyone was nervous, everyone was chatting in private.In his spare time, Wen Shengge came over and said, \"Sui Sui, you know what,\u00a0I heard that the online voting list has come out now. We have very few debut positions this time. There are only six positions in total. Do you know who the top six people to get those positions will be? \"Jian Xingsui answered honestly, \"I don't know.\"\"I have some gossip.\" Wen Shengge came over and whispered, \"The first confirmed position is of Brother Chen, and the second is of An Ran.\"Jian Xingsui was not surprised.What Wen Shengge didn't expect was that he was so calm: \"Aren't you surprised?\"Jian Xingsui was of course not surprised. He knew that the protagonist's smooth road will not stop here. He will make his debut in the Center position, and then he will participate in a variety show next to become popular. Then he will reach the pinnacle of his life.\"I thought this matter was quite strange, so I went to inquire more, and then I heard some amazing news, do you want to know?\" Wen Shengge approached and said, \"That An Ran, he is actually the brother of the popular star Jian Zhi ah!\"Jian Xingsui stopped drinking water.\"Jianzhi ah! I'm really envious. It's no wonder that An Ran's popularity is so high. It was probably because someone was backing him.\" Wen Shengge sighed: \"He really has a good life. We can't match him at all.\u00a0And the most important thing is how low-key he was! If I had such a brother, I would have showed off every day, right? \"Showed off every day.................Jian Xingsui lowered his head and vaguely recalled his past life in a trance. When some broken memories were remembered again, they hurt like glass shards piercing your heart.\"My brother is Jian Zhi!\"''My brother is best. Why can't I brag about him?''\"Why did you scold my brother? Do you want to fight?\"\"Brother, brother...\"From childhood to adulthood, his brothers were the ones he liked the most. But he was very stupid, and he always did a lot of wrong things, which made his brothers angry:\"It's all because you were coming to find me, and the paparazzi followed you to photograph my scandal.\"\"What were you fighting for? Now the media says my brother is a gangster.\"\"Jian Xingsui, can you fucking save some face for me?\"In fact, he knew for a long time that he was a mediocre and not excellent person from the inside out. It was only the excellence of his brothers that made him look ''good''.\u00a0He always thought it was his blessing, but he didn't expect that it would become a lifetime of pain and shackles in the end. Maybe many things were wrong from the beginning.Wen Shengge was still babbling: \"Actually a lot of people's parents came today. I heard that Brother Chen's mother also came. She is the young lady of the Shen family. I heard that Mrs. Shen is very good-looking, I really want to see what kind of woman can raise the kid with the temper of Brother Chen?\"Jian Xingsui's mood was a little down. He didn't have much interest. He said, \"I'll go to the toilet.\"Wen Shengge said, \"Oh, then go and come back quickly.\"\"Um.\"When Jian Xingsui learned that he might perform in front of Jian Zhi, his mood was a little complicated. After going to the toilet, he came out and washed his face with cold water on the sink. While cleaning, a voice came from behind: \"Jian Xingsui.\"That both familiar and unfamiliar voice made his body freeze.Jian Xingsui slowly turned around and saw a face that made him nervous. He took a deep breath and said, \"Second brother...Mr. Jian.\"Jian Zhi was standing by the sink. Today he was wearing a suit. He looked very handsome and upright.Jian Zhi turned on the water in the sink, and said in a low voice, \"Yo! It looks like you have made progress. You finally know to call me MR. JIAN!\"Jian Xingsui didn't speak.\"I heard that you didn't take the money from eldest brother and father when you left?\" Jian Zhi continuously seemed like he was mocking when he spoke: \"When you left, you left quite simply, but as a result, you came to Ran Ran's variety show and you are even targeting him everywhere. What do you want to do with him?\"Jian Xingsui was suspicious: \"When did I target him?\"\"You know he's afraid of you, yet you deliberately came to participate in this variety show.\u00a0What 20,000 yuan? You didn't even want the millions that eldest brother and father gave you. What kind of poor character did you come here to set up. Trying to act miserable? Jian Zhi looked at Jian Xingsui with disgust: \"You really make me sick!!!\"2When these words full of hurtful meanings fell into his ears, Jian Xingsui who had thought he didn't care for these things for a long time, felt as if his heart was shattering into pieces.He turned his face away, not wanting to let his injured eyes be seen by Jianzhi. He said stubbornly: \"I don't need to explain to you what I do. As for whether I was acting miserably or not, if you think so, I have nothing to say. \"Jian Zhi didn't expect that Jian Xingsui would actually retort.He sneered, turned off the faucet, and slowly wiped his hands with a piece of paper: \"If you weren't acting, then I really 'respect' you, but I'm here to warn you that in this camp, don't try to bully Ran Ran because..........'', he smirked, ''.... he is my brother now.\"Jian Xingsui's heart became cold a little bit.Jian Zhi raised his head, looked directly at him, and opened his lips: \"Also, in the whole entertainment industry in the future, never mention that I was once your brother.\" (T/N: I told you how pain in ass this Jian Zhi is! And sadly this is just the beginning.'')After the voice fell, Jian Zhi wanted to wait for Jian Xingsui's reaction, but the young man just stood there blankly without any reaction. His face was too calm. Maybe he had been in pain, but after too much pain, he was numb.The child had grown, his dream was gone, and he had finally learned to comfortably be numb.It was unknown why, but at this moment, Jian Zhi suddenly remembered, many times, there was a boy with enthusiasm and a little hope, who always followed behind him and called softly: \"Brother, brother...\"But now, that child just silently bowed to himself, then turned and left.Inexplicably, he had originally come here to see Jian Xingsui crying and begging him. Afterall this once good for nothing brother of his was someone who used to worship him. So he had thought, at least in front of him, he would beg to call him brother again. And now even though he had achieved his wish of mocking this kid mercilessly, when he saw the back of Jian Xingsui leaving, Jian Zhi's mood suddenly became complicated.4......On the other side, Jian Xingsui, who appeared to be unresponsive, turned around and entered the unmonitored stairway after leaving the bathroom.Just now, he had been holding back all kinds of emotions. Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. Now he was leaning against the cold corner where not a single soul was present all ALONE. His lips trembled slightly and his eyes were dyed red. Finally, he couldn't hold back two lines of tears. He cried.......Just when the boy's shoulders were leaning against the white wall, someone walked by outside. He held back his choking and did not dare to make a sound, trying his best to digest the surging pain in his heart.2At this moment, the footsteps of high-heeled shoes came from the stairway. It was a gentle female voice calling someone: \"Chenchen, where exactly are you talking about, mother can't find it...\"Except for her voice, everything was silent.The woman who happened to be there stopped her voice and looked at the boy in the corner. Shen Xingchen on the other end of the phone was still saying, \"Hello, Mom? Why don't you talk?\"Xu Enzhen responded casually and hung up the phone. She stepped forward and walked a few steps to Jian Xingsui, and said softly, \"Child, what's the matter with you, are you alright?\"The woman's gentle voice broke the last psychological defense of the boy.Jian Xingsui shook his head randomly. His voice choked: \"I'm okay, I'm.......really.....okay...\"Because he had lowered his face and the light on the stairs was a little dim, for a moment, Xu Enzhen had thought she saw her little son. But Jian Xingsui was obviously more immature and younger than Shen Xingchen. The young boy squatted there and silently wiped his tears in embarrassment. They clearly didn't know each other, but Xu Enzhen couldn't help feeling pitiful for this child. An unknown panic and distress emerge from the depth of her heart.2She suddenly thought in a trance, if her third child hadn't died, he would have been as old as this child by now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeeing Jian Xingsui lowering his head to wipe his face with the back of his hand, Xu Enzhen quickly took out a clean handkerchief from her bag and handed it to him: \"Here, use this to wipe it?\"The clean handkerchief seemed to still have a faint fragrance, and it was embroidered with delicate textures. It looked very beautiful and it was obviously something that no one would use to wipe their own tears let alone give others.Jian Xingsui shook his head gently. His voice was a little choked and hoarse: \"No need, it's too wasteful...\"\"How could it be a waste.\" Xu Enzhen saw that he was in pain but was still holding back tears. Obviously, he was in such a painful state, but he was still thinking his tears were wasteful. He clearly didn't know that his tears were worthy too. Xu Enzhen's heart was inexplicably painful as if being stabbed by a needle. She squatted down involuntarily and gently wiped away the tears on Jian Xingsui's cheeks with the handkerchief. She was not afraid that the white handkerchief would be stained at all.As she approached, there was a light and warm aroma that spread to Jian Xingsui's nose.It was not the pungent perfume smell, but the faint and light body fragrance. In fact, this lady was very beautiful, but at this moment, Jian Xingsui's eyes weren't in the condition to be able to identify beauty. He just felt that she was so gentle and the smell on her body was inexplicably too assuring. Just like a dog that has been bullied by the whole world and had no one to care for in this world, that dog could finally relax in someone's embrace now.\u00a0In an instant, his heart gradually became very calm.Xu Enzhen took back the handkerchief and said softly, \"You must also be someone who participated in the show, right? Did your parents or friends buy tickets to see you this time?\"Jian Xingsui hesitated for a moment. He thought of Jian Zhi, but that person was no longer his brother, so he shook his head gently and replied in a low voice, \"No.\"Xu Enzhen looked at him squatting there alone. With unstoppable pity in her heart, she said, \"What's your name, in fact, I should remember you, because my son...\"The door outside was suddenly opened from the outside, and someone came in.Shen Xingchen strode over in his costume and said, \"Mom, what are you doing here?\"Taking a closer look, he found that not only his mother but his best buddy was also there. Jian Xingsui's tears had been wiped away, but his eyes were still red. It was obvious that he had cried.Shen Xingchen was suspicious: \"Why are you crying?\"Jian Xingsui subconsciously said, \"I didn't cry...\"\"You didn't cry? Are you taking Lao Zi as a blind dude?\" Shen Xingchen's violent temper came: \"Who? Who bullied you? Mom, did you see anyone here before? He is my newly recognized younger brother and someone actually dared to bully my younger brother. I must kill his 6 ancestors today...\"Jian Xingsui hurriedly stopped him and said, \"No, no, I just lost my eye contact and I'm uncomfortable. It's really okay, brother, aren't we going to go on stage in a while? We have to perform, why are you here?\"Shen Xingchen was suspicious: \"Are you telling truth or not?\"Jian Xingsui nodded quickly.\"Tsk tsk tsk.\" Shen Xingchen immediately put on an expression of disgust.Xu Enzhen watched the two of them bicker, and suddenly became a little ecstatic. There were only two children in their family. Her eldest son was busy with work in the company all the year-round, so he seldom came back. Maybe the heavy responsibility of the family was also on his shoulders, so he was always rigid and strict. Meanwhile, her younger son's temper was a bit willful. He hates fake things and fake people to the great extent. Sometimes he can be stubborn as fuck. But his mind and heart were actually quite simple. So he could easily trust anyone who was good to him.But Jian Xingsui's temper was really good. The best thing about him was not that he could bear her son's bad temper, but that he could see through the concern of her son's vicious words.\u00a0When comforting Shen Xingchen, his eyes were tolerant and gentle, not perfunctory and impatient.This friend of Shen Xingchen......... is really worth Shen Xingchen's selfless care.........Performance stageThe performances on the stage were going on intensely. Several groups had already performed, and soon it was the turn of Jian Xingsui's group. The group that was competing against his group had performed in a modern hip-hop song.\u00a0When that team performed, the audience had already been extremely excited. The whole audience was shouting and supporting them loudly. After all, who won't like those energetic and swaggy-styled songs. Therefore, the audience had very little hope for Jian Xingsui's group members who were going to perform in National styled traditional song.Viewers also commented:\"I think this hip-hop group will win.\"\"They were really amazing, it's hard for another group to surpass them.\"\"The next group seems to be performing in a bit more nationalistic song, it's hard for them to move the audience...\"In the lively auditorium, mentors had sat on the judge's seat. Of course, the most eye-catching one was Fu Jinxiao, who was sitting in the middle. Today, Film emperor Fu had worn a British-style white shirt with a coffee-colored coat and gold-rimmed glasses.\u00a0He looked like a gentle and elegant gentleman, but he was sitting there lazily, looking at the stage casually. That lazy look added a bit of ruffianness to his noble boy's appearance, which was very eye-catching.Part of the audience were fans of Film emperor Fu. Because of that, the price of the tickets had been shockingly high. There were mentors sitting in other positions on the mentor's platform. The only difference was that there was one more judge sitting.He also had the right to vote. But the mentors could not vote for the team. They could only select the best contestant from each team to support and vote.Before going on stage, Shen Xingchen said, \"Don't be nervous, just follow the rehearsal.\" The others nodded in agreement.When the stage lights were completely extinguished and the melodious piano sounded, the entire stage slowly lit up. Several boys slowly appeared. They appeared in the center of the stage wearing dark blue ancient clothing, and the cheerful singing echoed on the stage giving a somewhat relaxed feel:\"Firefly, oh firefly, don't steal a glance, just shake your head and memorize this poem dedicated for my...\"...\"Flower of jasmine, so fair!Budding and blooming here and there,Pure and fragrant all do declare.Let me pick you with tender care,Sweetness for all to share.Jasmine fair, oh Jasmine fair.''Several youths were on the stage, holding Chinese fans and shaking their heads when they sang these lines. When they sang, the audience also subconsciously started to sing with them. The song's style was melodious but it wasn't just limited to those melodies. With every new line the boys sang, new kinds of melody and rhythm sounded all along. The stage performance was going extremely smoothly, and their interaction with the audience during the ongoing performance was also full of fun. Many audiences were fascinated by it without even realizing it. They were completely mesmerized by the boys' facial expressions and vocal performance on the stage, so much that they ignored their dance skills. Therefore, even if Jian Xingsui's skills were not solid, it didn't completely drag his team.Just when everyone thought it would always be so melodious and cheerful, the tune reached the climax, but it was unlike regular normal pitch. It was extremely high-pitched mixed with some modern touch which was very shocking. It was entirely unexpected.:\"Every young Chinese has absorbed the bravery of five thousand years............. Our soil has the power of modesty and magic in the legend. A proud bone cannot be hidden, and it shines with the power of wisdom.........\"The boys changed their dancing style to a more rough but also elegant style. Everyone's dance steps were neatly performed. The way they turned around clasping each others' hands in unity, that scene looked very powerful, like real Chinese youths working hard for their motherland. It was as if they were letting everyone see the power of patriotism in them. When the spotlight fell, their entire bodies were shining as well as their young faces.With the high-pitched music, the youths sang in unison on the stage, which made everyone's scalp numb. The blood and faith contained in them and their voices made people's hearts surging:\"Young strong China definitely makes us proud. Whether we lose or win, we continue to believe........carrying infinite hopes and dreams, flying like a dragon...\"This song was actually an ancient song, but its style and tune had been fine-tuned in the middle out of nowhere, and such fine-tuning made the whole song more enthusiastic, full of hope and vitality. It was something that made the audience realize that they were mesmerized not just because of the boys' cool and handsome faces but because of the power of hope and belief that they were seeing in the eyes of those young boys. Yes, they were the boys who were one day going to make themselves, their families, and the entire nation proud. Even if they fail, they will fail with smiles on their face. Nothing was more powerful than this message.When a song came to an end, there was silence at first................followed by a burst of applause.The live broadcast room exploded:\"I will see which fellow won't vote for \"Youth China\"!\"\"Who edited the song's tune! I beg to put it on the album soon, I'll play it on a loop!\"\"It's amazing, my eyes can't fall on anyone, because each of them seems to be shining!!\"When the performance was over, everyone was sweating and everyone was cheering.Mentor Tuya took the lead to pick up the microphone and said, \"Very good, your performance was very good.\"Jian Zhi also picked up the microphone, but instead of praising the team, he called someone's name and said, \"An Ran, you danced very well. How many years have you learned dance?\" (T/N: Seriously bro?)An Ran panted, and he said, \"I have been learning dance for more than ten years. I have started learning since I was a child.\"\"This kind of national style dance is difficult to learn.\" Jian Zhi sighed: \"It takes a lot of effort.\"An Ran was very tired, but he still answered the judge's words in the best manner: \"Well... it was indeed very hard. When I practiced dancing before, my feet suffered a lot of injuries. When I was young, I would cry a lot. While practicing, I sometimes thought of giving up, but fortunately, I have been insisting on it, which is also the most fortunate thing for me.\"1His strong appearance also made many viewers feel distressed: (T/N: Ohh I see............)\"Little Angel Ran Ran is amazing.\"\"He is really inspirational.\"\"He looks good too!\"Jian Zhi kept giving An Ran shots, and also won a lot of goodwill for An Ran. Originally, all the audience's attention had been attracted by the narcissist duo. Unexpectedly, Fu Jinxiao, who was next to Jian Zhi, slowly picked up the microphone and only asked a question lightly. After that, everyone's attention was drawn back: \"Who edited this song?\"Everyone looked at Jian Xingsui.Jian Xingsui slowly took a step forward and replied, \"I edited it, Teacher Fu.\"\"En.\" Fu Jinxiao lifted his eyelids to look at him. His eyes were full of sincere praise: \"Very good.\"How fiercely he had scolded the boy in the training room, that is how frankly and sincerely he expressed his praise.Film emperor Fu affirmed: \"Your edit was very successful.\"It was definitely the most exciting and happy thing to get praise from your idol. Jian Xingsui couldn't help showing a smile. He bowed deeply but he did not take credit. He said: \"I was indeed the one who completed editing the song but I received a lot of help from my teammates as well. Even to improve my dancing skills, they helped a lot, especially Xingchen, who despite being a captain with greater responsibilities often accompanied me to practice all night.\"When he was given the camera shot and was named by his mentor, he did not only focus on himself but also pulled his teammates to come forward and speak. Because he knew how hard each and every one of them had worked. However, even such a small detail made all his teammates instantly move.They used to despise Jian Xingsui and even thought he will drag them. They also heard some rumors that Jian Xingsui had a bad character, but after getting along, they realized how wrong those rumors were.Jian Zhi's face was not very good. He said softly: \"I think editing is one aspect, and personal strength is also very important. If you have a poor foundation in dancing, it will still affect the team.\"No one thought he would actually speak to a contestant in that tone.However, what was even more unexpected was that Fu Jinxiao who had never intervened in the evaluation of other mentors, at this moment, when Jian Zhi's voice fell, the corner of Film emperor Fu's mouth evoked a sneer, and he opened the microphone: \"A complete team definitely would have both shortcomings and strengths. It is precisely because of mutual improvement and mutual compromise that a real team can be formed.\u00a0If you focus on your weakness instead of the contribution to the team, you won't get very far.\"Jian Zhi didn't expect that Fu Jinxiao would actually speak. He himself was someone who couldn't be provoked in the circle, but even for someone like him, there were some people who they could call daddy in terms of power, and Fu Jinxiao......... was one of them.Tuya also said: \"I think all of you are improving smoothly. You guys performed very well. Jian Xingsui, your dance has improved very fast, you are doing great as well.\"The best dancer in the national style dance there was An Ran, but because Jian Zhi had constantly talked about him from the beginning, other mentors then only talked about remaining other contestants. The audience gradually forgot An Ran. After everyone got their evaluation and praise, the whole team was quite happy, only An Ran, who wanted to make a name for himself, was not very happy. He looked at the group of people in front of him who were maintaining a harmonious atmosphere, and secretly clenched his fists.............During the break, Xu Enzhen found Fu Jinxiao backstage to learn about her son's situation: \"Tonight, Xingchen didn't cause you any trouble, right?\"Fu Jinxiao leaned against the handrail of the corridor leisurely: \"Auntie, you are very kind, what trouble can I have?\"Xu Enzhen admired Fu Jinxiao very much. This person was young and promising. The most important thing was that he had a valuable character and was very capable. In fact, he was very good at taking care of others. So she sighed in a clich\u00e9: \"Xingchen ah, this child, we spoiled him a little bit when he was young, so when he grew up, his temper is a little more willful and arrogant. In fact, originally, I was thinking, our Shen family and your Fu family have such a good relationship, if we can have a marriage kind of relationship....then....hehe..won't that be...\"\"Tsk.\"Fu Jinxiao smiled helplessly: \"Auntie, stop joking, Shen Xingchen, that little brat, is really not my type. Don't even think about it. So please stop involving me in a messy thing like marriage........\"Just as he was talking, a group of boys walked by not far away, it was Shen Xingchen and his team.Fu Jinxiao squinted a little, watching Shen Xingchen hug Jian Xingsui's shoulder. The slightly shorter man was surrounded by the team members, he probably didn't know what to say, so he was smiling lightly. The small buzz head looked too cute.Xu Enzhen was a little helpless: \"It seems that Xingchen is not lucky, but so are you. In fact, it is time to start a family at this age. In fact, aunt is quite curious. What kind of child can catch your eye?\"Fu Jinxiao smacked his tongue lightly.\u00a0On his elegant and handsome face, his eyebrows were slightly raised, and a smile flashed across his eyes. He seemed to be very mature and stable, but at this moment, his heart started to scatter his thoughts indiscriminately.I think.... that kid is fine.Film Emperor Fu thought to himself......Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When they got off the stage, they naturally wanted to run to eat something.Shen Xingchen said, \"Once our performance is over, shouldn't the show crew give us a big meal to celebrate?\"Other teammates chimed in and joined the fantasy queue:\"Will they give us a whole roasted lamb?\"\"I really want to eat hot pot.\"\"I mean, shouldn't they give us 1 million worth of food?\"''Who will eat that much?''''Shut up! Tell me, why do the French like to eat snails?''''....................''''Because they don't like fast food. Hahahaha... You FOOLS!!!....Hey hey hey did you guys not hear about the peanut joke?....NO??? HAHA But I'm still not telling you guys....You guys might spread it!!!.....HAHAHAHAHA!!!''Everyone: ''....This person..........was quite funny.''Let's just go by ourselves ba!'' Someone said.Shen Xingchen agreed.\u00a0Don't look at him now wearing the clothes of a handsome young man, but even wearing such elegant clothes, he looked like a villain. Everyone else seemed to be going to study, and he looked like he was going to have a ''good chat'' with someone. He said, \"Let me tell you, let's just go to the canteen.\"The others agreed happily along.Shen Xingchen looked sideways at the person next to him and said, \"How about you? What do you want to buy when you go out?\"\"Me.\" Jian Xingsui thought for a while, then smiled and said, \"Anything is okay.\"Shen Xingchen snorted: \"What a pretender.\"Jian Xingsui: ''.....''It's not that Jian Xingsui didn't want to pick anything. But because previously he was a rich\u00a0dude, he had a variety of foods to choose from. But now, he simply had a budget of a few dollars per meal. So he didn't know what could he choose with that little money.When the group went to the canteen, there was indeed a lot of food there. There were also a few teams who had finished their performances eating and taking food there.Shen Xingchen beckoned: \"Ning Ze.\"Ning Ze, who had also finished the performance, walked over.\"How are you?\" Shen Xingchen took a piece of bread to eat: \"Are you okay?\"Ning Ze was a relatively quiet person in their dormitory, but he was actually a very strong contestant. This time he was in another group, and he had also been practicing hard. Many times he often stayed up late until the early morning to finish. He actually had very solid skills in dancing, so he didn't require to practice very hard but he was still so serious.Obviously, he had worked very hard to complete the performance, and his performance in the team was also brilliant, but the most unfortunate thing was that the person on the team with him this time was Li Xu'an.During the whole performance, Ning Ze's limelight was suppressed to death, and it could almost be said that his screentime was robbed. Of course, it was not because Ning Ze was not good enough, but what was even more heart-wrenching was that all the cameras almost only filmed Li Xu'an.\u00a0Even the questions asked by the mentors later were all on Li Xu'an, and all Ning Ze's efforts were in vain.Ning Ze said, \"I'm okay.\"Jian Xingsui was a little worried, and took the initiative to encourage him to say: \"It's okay, I believe in your strength, Ah ze, you can definitely shine more on the next stage!\"A smile flashed across Ning Ze's eyes, and he nodded: \"This time I didn't do my best, I'll work hard later.\"Among all the contestants there, if you are talking about the desire to perform on the stage and the pressure to debut, no one had more pressure than him.Shen Xingchen picked up the food next to him and said to Jian Xingsui, \"Hurry up and eat, we have to go back after eating, and there is still a final performance to record.\"Jian Xingsui said, \"Okay.\"They had all been busy all night and were hungry.Although they could have eaten backstage, there were still people who were yet to perform and couldn't eat and rest, not to mention the mentors and photographers, who hadn't eaten anything.Jian Xingsui thought of Fu Jinxiao. Others might not know it well, but he had been chasing his idol for many years. He knew that the film emperor did not take care of his body very much. This was reflected in various aspects. In the early years, in order to record songs again and again, because of too much hard work, the film emperor's throat was almost exhausted. Later, he suffered from severe throat disease. Although it did not lead to his inability to sing, and there were no serious consequences, it also left some after-effects.He couldn't talk for long or his throat would hurt.This was all in his early days when he had to use his throat too often. Very few people knew that with the rise of his status in recent years, there were very few occasions where it was necessary to use his throat so tiredly, but today was obviously an exception.Jian Xingsui said, \"Xingchen, aunt has been sitting in the auditorium for a long time. Go and give her something to eat.\"\"Oh, that's right.\" Shen Xingchen looked at the time: \"The program will have a break soon. We can then sneak to the back and give her something to eat smoothly.\"Shen Xingchen thought about it and complained again: \"My mother will definitely ask Brother Fu if I have caused trouble again. Let's wait a bit, I will go over there in a while. What if me, Brother Fu, and my mom will meet at the same place? It will be really miserable. I don't know if Brother Fu has already complained about me or not, shall I take something to bribe him?\"Jian Xingsui's heart moved slightly, and he said tentatively, \"Then give something to eat to him too, the mentors must not have eaten either.\"Shen Xingchen felt that this was a good idea: \"Yes, then I'll get some bread or something for him to eat. It's still you loser's brain that works.\"Jian Xingsui pursed his lips and smiled.During the break, the group of them went over, and they indeed saw the mentors who were resting.Shen Xingchen carried his things over, and after seeing Fu Jinxiao sitting on the lounge bench with his eyes closed, he slipped over: \"Brother Fu, wow, you look really good while resting on the lounge bench....wow this bench is so long and strong, indeed worthy of being a bench that is used by the film emperor himself...wow......\"Fu Jinxiao opened his eyes and glanced around lightly: \"Is something wrong?\"\"How can there be something wrong when I'm present..hehe.\" Big bully Chen put the things on the table: \"I got you something to eat, it's all about caring, giving, and eating..hehe.\"Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows and said coldly, \"Aren't you worried that your mom will give you a ''nice'' whoop in your ass?\"Shen Xingchen's heart was pierced. But he still smiled embarrassingly. He was not afraid of heaven and earth, but he was afraid of his mother's that ''whoop''.Fu Jinxiao ignored him. After opening the bag, he thought it was just food but unexpectedly saw something under the food box. It was a plate of throat pills. He never liked throat pills that came with various messy flavors. And these pills were exactly the normal pills without any artificial flavors. He hadn't had a sore throat for a long time but he had really felt uncomfortable just now. He was just thinking that it would be better once he will drink some boiled water tonight, but he didn't expect that someone would actually deliver these helpful things so meticulously....Fu Jinxiao's eyes darkened. He didn't believe that Shen Xingchen had such a ''kind'' heart: \"Where did it come from?\"Shen Xingchen muttered: \"I got it for you, who else could give this kind of thing to you.\"Fu Jinxiao didn't rush. He just put down the box slowly and laughed lightly: \"Not long ago, aunt said that it was a pity that the two families' children didn't get married. She said that you didn't know how to care about people, and you didn't understand me, it seems that that was not true. It was a completely false statement. So now, to give you justice, I'll go talk to my aunt...\"Shen Xingchen was really frightened: \"Brother, I was wrong, I'll be honest, I didn't bring it!\"Fu Jinxiao looked at him leisurely.\"How could I have thought of this.\" Shen Xingchen pointed to Jian Xingsui who was talking to Tuya softly not far away: \"He went to the staff to ask for it, and let me put it in this bag and bring it to you. \"Fu Jinxiao followed the direction he pointed and squinted.Jian Xingsui over there was also giving some food to mentor Tuya with his teammates. At this moment, they were having a good chat. Tuya had always been very fond of this child. She was even covering her mouth to laugh. It looked like she was having a very happy conversation.Jian Xingsui.......it was him again.In fact, very few people knew about the discomfort in his throat. The first to know was his agent, and even the new assistant was not clear.\u00a0If he went back further, some fans from many years ago might know about it, but those people were very few, and they might not still be his fan.\u00a0He had been used to seeing people coming and going in the entertainment industry for many years, so he didn't really believe in long-term love words.So......how the hell did that kid know?Did he really approach himself with a purpose and did he really send these pills with a purpose?Thinking of the time when the little buzz-head had secretly tried to argue for him and had been standing silently in the parking lot picking up the lights that others didn't want, Fu Jinxiao's thoughts slowly went out again.Maybe, he really is his fan...Silently, he remembered that there was once a person who was the only person he remembered the most. That person had been actively encouraging him on Weibo since he was unknown.\u00a0In the past, when he posted on Weibo for a long time, no one was there. Only that little fan kept encouraging him and following him. Although the words he said were unsatisfactory, they were clumsy and cute.Thinking of this, inexplicably, the Film emperor's Fu always cold heart softened a little, and he asked, \"Then why didn't he PERSONALLY give it to me?\"This sentence awakened Shen Xingchen. He thought about this with his straight man's mind, and then said: \"I don't know, wasn't it just because I wanted to bring you something, so he just put it in the bag and let me bring it at the same time? \"Fu Jinxiao opened his lips: \"Then why couldn't he come along with you?\"\"Why? Maybe, because he wants to deliver something to Teacher Tuya. Besides, it's enough for me to deliver it to you alone. Why do you need so many people?\" Shen Xingchen said carelessly.\"Oh?\"Fu Jinxiao looked at the person who was chatting with Tuya not far away. He narrowed his eyes dangerously, and a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. But that smile was just too cold: \"Then why are there so many of them while giving the same thing to Tuya?\"Shen Xingchen looked at him suspiciously.\u00a0He always thought straight, and spoke without going through his brain: \"I think he likes Ms. Tuya or maybe he is a fan of Ms. Tuya? Isn't this normal, after all, Ms. Tuya is beautiful......oh hey, it can't be that you think Ms. Tuya is more respected than you? HEHE\u00a0When it comes to sexy charm, your charm is indeed not as big as Sister Yaya, don't be jealous, maybe he is indeed sister Tuya's fan.\"Her fan, you fart!Fu-angry-Jinxiao looked up at the young man not far away.That kid..................... obviously is my fan.......................................................................Guys, if you see any mistakes then please tell me, I released this chapter at midnightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJian Xingsui seemed to feel that someone was looking at him from behind, but after turning his head to look, he only saw Film emperor Fu chatting with Shen Xingchen. The two were talking and didn't seem to notice him.It must be his own delusion...He shook his head, and couldn't help but sneak a few glances, wondering if the film emperor Fu had eaten throat pills or not. If his throat was really uncomfortable then the pills could help him relax.Tuya noticed his gaze and said softly, \"Sui Sui, do you want to go over and say hello to Teacher Fu?\"Jian Xingsui quickly retracted his gaze and hurriedly shook his head: \"NO NO I was just looking around.\"Tuya was a little frightened by his overreaction.Soon, the blonde female mentor smiled again, and she said, \"Don't be nervous, I have no other intentions. I just wanted to tell you, in fact, Brother Fu ah, he is not that scary. Although he can be quite strict at times, he is also very concerned about you guys. So if you like him, you can go and chat, don't be afraid.\"Just as Jian Xingsui wanted to say that he understood, An Ran next to him said, \"I think Brother Fu is very good ah. It is just right for him to be strict with us. In fact, he is not strict at all. I can feel that Brother Fu is actually quite gentle!\"His voice was not small, unlike Jian Xingsui who always spoke in a low voice. Although An Ran's voice sounded gentle, the decibel was not low, as if he deliberately wanted the people over there to hear it.\"Sui Sui, don't think about Brother Fu that much.\" An Ran looked sideways at Jian Xingsui with a concerned look, and didn't give him a chance to explain: \"Actually, Brother Fu is very good.\" (T/N: Tsk....I......)\"...\"I haven't said anything yet.Jian Xingsui turned around and looked over there. Fortunately, Fu Jinxiao didn't seem to pay much attention to this place and didn't look at them. As for whether he heard it or not, he was not sure.\u00a0Usually, if it was anything else, he wouldn't bother with An Ran. After all, those petty fights with this fake person were harmless, but when it came to his idol, and now when he was deliberately misinterpreted, the fire in his heart rose again.Jian Xingsui glanced at An Ran coldly, his eyes full of coldness.The re-recording was about to start again. Tuya was called away, and the other mentors also left, leaving only the contestants there.An Ran was frightened by Jian Xingsui's gaze. He looked at Jian Xingsui hesitantly and innocently and said, \"I'm sorry, did I say something wrong? I'm sorry, I just wanted to help...\"\"No.\" Jian Xingsui said, \"I don't need your help.\"An Ran's face\u00a0looked like he was hurt and wronged.Jian Xingsui didn't show any emotion. He said, \"Your second brother came to see me and asked me to stop bothering you. Do you know this?\"An Ran paused, of course, he knew.\u00a0However, if he really nodded, it would not be very good, so he fell into silence for a while, not knowing how to answer this question.\"Now, I'll return those words to you.\" Jian Xingsui looked at him coldly, got closer, and said in a voice that only two people could hear: \"Go fuck yourself and your family and STOP BOTHERING ME!!!\"An Ran looked up at him unexpectedly. He met Jian Xingsui's dark eyes and heard him say, \"What's yours will always be yours, I will not rob anything from you. Don't be too impatient making fool of yourself. It makes you look ugly and......DIGUSTING.\"In a few short words, Jian Xingsui's words seemed to be completely out of context and irrevalent, but An Ran understood it all.This was the first time that An Ran no longer put a soft image in front of Jian Xingsui. He looked at Jian Xingsui with deep thought, and in the end, he didn't say anything. He just turned his head and left....On the front stage, all the teams had finished their performances. And now it was time for the most exciting voting segment of the program where the best performance king and the most popular king of each team would be chosen.The director team had already started counting down on the big screen. They asked all the contestants to come on stage, and Mr. Li shouted: \"Now, the most popular king voted by our live audiences and the best performance king voted by the mentors of each group will be revealed on the screen, at the countdown of..... Three.......... Two............ One........ Please show it!\"The numbers on the big screen flickered and timed, and all the contestants turned around to watch their stats and votes.This was very important to everyone. This will greatly affect whether they will be ranked highly or lowly from now on for the rest of the program.The big screen finally showed the data.The most popular king: Shen Xingchen with a total of 132 votes from the audience.The best performance king voted by the mentors: Jian AnranThe moment the big words appeared on the screen, An Ran showed a smile, but Shen Xingchen looked back at one of his teammates. He was once always sunny and arrogant, always like a boy who only cared about himself. But now, when he was chosen as the most popular king by the audience, his first reaction was to look at Jian Xingsui. Even the other teammates didn't stepped forward to celebrate the two Kings' win. Instead, they all looked at Jian Xingsui.There was no other reason.During this period of time, each and every one of them knew who had worked hardest in the team. Every day, in order not to slow down the progress of the team, he stayed up until midnight and sometimes, didn't sleep at all. In order to arrange and edit songs, he always was the first one to come and the last one to left.\u00a0No one said it, but everyone felt that if their team could have an honor, this honor should be given to Jian Xingsui.Only Jian Xingsui smiled. He went over and hugged Shen Xingchen: \"Congratulations, I knew you could do it.\"Shen Xingchen suppressed the thoughts in his heart bitterly and snorted softly: \"Of course, did you forget who this young master is?\"The audience in the live broadcast room felt a bit complicated:\"Although Ran Ran and Xingchen are ranked very well, I always feel weird.\"\"The look in 20,000's eyes when he saw the ranking just now was so heartbreaking.\"\"Jian Xingsui is a poor dancer to begin with.\"\"His foundation is too poor and some of his movements are still not strong enough. They were not worthy of the ranking.\"After all the rankings were announced, the recording was basically over.Everyone exited in an orderly manner, but there were also some contestants who went off the stage to talk to some fans and relatives who had come to see them. Jian Xingsui and his teammates all followed their captain Shen Xingchen.Not far away, the mentors were all there, and An Ran ran over to share the joy with his brother Jian Zhi.Other teammates also went to find their own parents and friends.Shen Xingchen also went to chat with his mother. Xu Enzhen happened to be by Fu Jinxiao's side, and when she saw her son, she couldn't help but pull Shen Xingchen over to talk about it.So Jian Xingsui was left all alone with a bit of embarrassment. He didn't know whether he should go back first.He was hesitating on the spot when he saw film emperor Fu just getting off the stage and leaning against the table to drink water to rest. He hesitated whether to go forward to say hello. Just when he was hesitating to take a step, someone from behind took the lead in saying: \"Brother Fu!\"An Ran walked over happily, with a smile on his face, full of energy.Jian Xingsui had to shut up.Fu Jinxiao was originally standing there, admiring the buzzhead's tangled expression, betting when would the boy finally dare to come over, when he was suddenly disturbed. The actor was displeased, but he did not show it on his face clearly. He just looked at An Ran uninterestingly: \"Is something wrong?\"\"I'm here to thank you.\" An Ran looked a little shy and said, \"I know that the best performance king was voted by the mentors themselves. So I wanted to thank you for giving me this recognition.\"Fu Jinxiao: \"Oh?\"An Ran nodded lightly. He stood there with red lips and white teeth, looking very beautiful, but also a little shy, as if he was really moved: \"Brother Fu, thank you very much, thank you to all the mentors for recognizing my hard work. I... I have been practicing dance hard. I had practiced just for this day, in order to be seen, and now I feel that all of my efforts were not in vain, thank you...Although I'm sad that my teammates couldn't win anything despite them working hard as well, I also feel result should always be fair......\"\u00a0(T/N: This AN Ran makes me feel so tired that it makes me not want to translate this anymore. What should I do guys? I think you guys cursing him mercilessly will definitely work.)1Fu Jinxiao listened indifferently.In fact, he liked hard-working young people very much. According to reason, An Ran was actually very good, and he was good in overall aspects as well, but for some reason, although it was An Ran who was standing in front of Fu Jinxiao right now, still, both in his heart and his mind, he was thinking of another person.Obviously that kid was also very hardworking. Even though he had absolutely no foundation in dancing, instead of working for his chance to shine solo on the stage by practicing dance hard without caring anything, he would rather sacrifice his precious and limited dance practice time to contribute to the team.\u00a0But no audience knew and remembered this. They will only think that he did not work hard, and thus danced poorly.\u00a0Whether it was success or failure, this boy never thought to say anything, and endured it silently where no one could see.But isn't the entertainment industry always like this? Always showing the instance success of a single person while ignoring the other 1000 people's sacrifices and efforts. But then again, who to blame? Audience themselves enjoy seeing those.An Ran got closer.Just when the cameraman came, and when he was about to capture the scene of two people chatting together, Fu Jinxiao avoided An Ran and dodged the camera.An Ran was a little embarrassed.Working many years in the entertainment industry, Fu Jinxiao had understood everything. It only depended on whether he wanted to play along with these petty tricks or not. In fact, there was nothing wrong with it. It's not wrong for young people to want to climb up.\u00a0But the problem was.........nothing. He just felt very annoying looking at the young man in front of him. He doesn't want to even be in the same frame as this dude. It's all about gut feeling bros...\"You don't need to thank me.\" Fu Jinxiao said coldly, and the actor's fake smile all the year round also looked too cold right now: \"If you really want to thank, then you are thanking the wrong person.\"An Ran was taken aback.Fu Jinxiao lifted his eyelids to look at him and opened his lips: \"The vote for the best performance king was voted by five mentors together. But you may not have looked at the voting list carefully. You had only gotten one vote.....so did Jian Xingsui.\"1An Ran slowly widened his eyes as if thinking of some possibility.\"Yes, that's right.\" Fu Jinxiao hooked his lips: \"I was the one who voted for HIM.\"...The next dayAfter the broadcasting was over, all contestants could take a short rest.The program team's notice came down. Because of the problem of their shooting time this time, the program team decided to invite some family members of the contestants to visit, so that they could shoot another interactive video.Before filming, a questionnaire was distributed to each trainee.Jian Xingsui took a look at the form and was stunned: \"I will even have to fill in the blood types of my parents?\"Shen Xingchen also sighed with emotion: \"The program team's investigation is really detailed. Why didn't they ask about the each family members' zodiac sign, how much everyone had peed when they were 2 years old, etc.\"The rest of the dormitory laughed.Jian Xingsui actually knew that he had blood type A, but it was embarrassing that he didn't know about the Zhang and his wife. So he was confused about this matter. It was also the Zhang couple who had found out that the child they were raising was the wrong one.\u00a0After they had found out about this in the hospital, they had contacted the Jian family. At that time, the Jian family head, Jian Gu, had gone to An Ran for a paternity test overnight, and then had confirmed the relationship.Later, there was a bloody storm.Because everything was too sudden, the two families were disturbed. The problems kept getting piled up, so Jian Xingsui himself had never done a paternity test with the Zhang couple. He didn't even know the Zhang couple's blood type.\u00a0The reason why he never paid attention to that was because Jian Xingsui never wanted to accept that he was not a child of the Jian family at all. From the bottom of his heart, he didn't want to go to the Zhang family for identification. In addition, An Ran started to act aggressively later, and thus delaying many things.Blood type?He really didn't know.Shen Xingchen leaned over and said, \"You're an A too? I'm an A too, what a coincidence!\"Jian Xingsui recovered and smiled: \"Yeah, what a coincidence.\"\"You fill it out first. I'll go out.\" Jian Xingsui walked out. He didn't know what to do, so he just simply took the form and went to ask An Ran.When he got there, he knocked on the door: \"I'm sorry to disturb you.\"Everyone in An Ran's dormitory turned their heads.This was a private matter, and it was not good to tell this in front of everyone. Jian Xingsui said, \"Can An Ran come over here, please?\"Zhou Xun looked at him vigilantly, but An Ran stopped Zhou Xun. He walked over, followed Jian Xingsui out of the dormitory, and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\"It's nothing.\" Jian Xingsui handed him the form in his hand: \"What is the blood type of the Zhang couple? Help me fill this out, I don't know.\"An Ran breathed a sigh of relief when he heard it was just this. He took the form over and said, \"Oh about this, you should have asked earlier, they are both B...\"Jian Xingsui didn't hear clearly: \"What?\"An Ran's words froze when he saw Jian Xingsui's blood type.''A''. Jian Xingsui's bloodtype was A.But the Zhang couple were both B. Couples with B blood type, how could they have a child with A blood type?An Ran suddenly remembered that when the Zhang couple had seen the blood test report, while they were chatting with the doctor that year, their expressions were totally frightened. They were even avoiding many questions of the doctor!\u00a0He hadn't thought about it that much at the time, but when he recalled it now, he felt that there were problems everywhere!Could it be...Not only was he not the Zhang couple's biological son, nor was Jian Xingsui?If not, who were Jian Xingsui's biological parents?An Ran's hand holding the paper tightened unconsciously. He suddenly thought of how his teammates had made fun of Shen Xingchen and Jian Xingsui looking alike. Could it be............. that they were really a family?Jian Xingsui waited for a while before he started to feel a little suspicious: \"What's wrong with you?\"An Ran returned to his senses, and unconsciously began to stutter: \"I... I'm fine.\"What to do?Should he tell him or not...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I still have to fill in other questions.\"\"Oh...\" An Ran's mood was quite complicated. He tentatively said, \"Then will mom and dad... Oh no, will uncle and aunt come to see you?\"Jian Xingsui was not sure, he said, \"They might come.\"An Ran smiled: \"That's good too. You guys haven't seen each other for a long time. So they probably are missing you as well.\"Jian Xingsui thought, if they will indeed come, then it should be because they missed you. It was unknown whether they would really come to see him or not.But he didn't need to talk about this kind of thing, so he just waited quietly for An Ran to fill out the form and took it over, and said, \"Thank you.\"Just as he was about to leave, An Ran behind him said, \"Wait!\"Jian Xingsui turned around to look at him.An Ran stood there, as if a little tangled, and finally said, \"Brother Jian Xingsui, maybe my father and brothers will come to see me in two days, you guys...\"Jian Xingsui stopped in place.It turned out that if the pain had been extreme, the body will still have a memory no matter what. When An Ran said this, his heart ached involuntarily. The memory of father Jian in his mind only remained of that day when he was standing in his room using cold words and throwing the cheque at him.In fact, sometimes, of course, he also recalled some other things. For example, when he was really young, his father would take their family out for a spring outing. He would hold himself in one hand and his brother in the other.\u00a0And his mother would cook his favorite dishes for him, the eldest brother would buy him the latest toys, and the second brother would come to his room to sing to him on rainy days.Their family used to be very good.But later, as he grew up, his own stupidity became unbearable, until he entered the same class as An Ran in junior high school. He didn't know when everything changed. It was like he opened the halo of cannon fodder after meeting An Ran. Then gradually, everyone around him was disappointed with him for even a smallest thing.He also wanted to work hard and become the pride of his family, but he was always messing up things, at least in the eyes of others. Some things were not something that could be grasped.\u00a0Over the years, he had lived so ignorantly, like a stick, obviously already feeling the pressure, but still unwilling to bend down and let go, and in the end he could only be smashed to pieces.He can't go back now.He knows that.\"Why are you telling me about this?\" When Jian Xingsui turned around again, his eyes were calm: \"I have nothing to do with them anymore.\"An Ran choked.This seemed to be the answer he wanted, but it also wasn't.Looking at the back of Jian Xingsui's departure, he felt inexplicably that this person seemed to be different from before, and would never be the same again....Next day,The program team started recording. Because the stage performance would not be recorded for the time being, so the program team arranged a task for everyone, that is, to call their parents in front of the camera.\u00a0The purpose was to see how everyone's parents would react when they haven't seen their children for a month.Before making the call, the staff member also came over and asked, \"I'll interview you guys a bit, how do you think your parents will react when they get on the phone?\"The contestants responded differently.Shen Xingchen: \"That's so obvious, they would of course, miss me.\"Ning Ze said succinctly: \"They will motivate me to work hard.\"Li Xu'an smiled: \"They should miss me very much, and then they will tell me something else such as to eat more.\"An Ran also showed a moved expression: \"I think it's enough as long as I can talk to my parents. To be honest, I miss them so much after being out for so long.\"The staff turned the camera to Jian Xingsui and said, \"What about you?\"Jian Xingsui didn't expect to get pointed by the camera.Facing the camera, he smiled slightly awkwardly: \"I can't guess this either.\"The staff laughed and let him go in the end, but the more this happened, the more curious everyone would be. Then someone came in and handed the box with the phone to everyone: \"There are five minutes now, please take this opportunity to call your parents and have a good conversation.\"After everyone got their phones, they started making calls.Shen Xingchen was the first one. He dialed the phone and heard a low-pitched male voice. Father Shen said, \"Is something wrong?\"\"Hey, Dad.\" Shen Xingchen tried to remain calm but at last couldn't hide his excitement: \"It's me, your son!\"Father Shen: \"Why, did you get into trouble again?\"The audience watching in the live broadcast room was laughing crazily.Shen Xingchen let out a \"tsk\" and couldn't maintain his expression: \"Dad, what are you talking about, I miss you, we have an event here in two days, you know, bring my brother to see me, this is this the only chance you'll get to see me for a few months!\"\"...\"There was a moment of silence on the other end of the phone.Shen Xingchen was very proud: \"What happened, are you very happy?\"\"Just a few months?\" Father Shen seemed to sigh, \"I thought I would be able to live in peace for more time.\"?Shen Xingchen's eyes widened.The audience in the live broadcast room was amused by the father and son's reaction. Although President Shen seemed to dislike his son, his words were full of doting, which made people laugh and envious.Then there were other contestants.Ning Ze's parents really cared about him and told him to work hard.Then An Ran called, and father Jian who answered the phone was equally gentle: \"Ran Ran, we all watched your live broadcast, you did a good job, we are all proud of you, don't worry and don't be afraid of anyone! You have your family's backing!\"The words brought tears to An Ran's eyes.1The audience in the live broadcast room was also moved.Almost everyone was taking the opportunity to express their feelings. Everone was happy and seemed to having one of the best times of their life finally being able to talk with their parents and getting their blessings. Only Jian Xingsui was sitting on the side. He was continuously dialing the phone, but the phone couldn't get through.One minute, Two minutes and now, Three minutes had passed. When everyone else was already concluding their loving conversations with their parents Jian Xingsui was always getting a cold mechanical voice in stead: \"I'm sorry, the user you called is temporarily unavailable...\"Jian Xingsui still.......wanted to try. Just this once, please pick it up. Please..... Please\"I'm sorry, the user you called is temporarily unavailable...\".........The staff's camera was facing Jian Xingsui: \"What's the matter, no one picked up?\"Jian Xingsui looked up at the camera and didn't know what to say. His hand on his lap tightened unconsciously. He lowered his eyes to cover up the gloom in his eyes, and forced a smile: \"Well, they should be busy.\"Were they really that busy?No one knew.In the past five minutes, all the contestants were chatting with their family members, only Jian Xingsui sat there without saying a word. He could only listen and feel from others how it felt like to have a parents.....a loving parents which he would probably never experience again.Finally, when the recording was over, the program team was going to take back the phone. Just when Jian Xingsui was about to return the phone, the phone suddenly vibrated, and then the bell rang. He hesitated for a while, wondering whether to pick it up or not because the five minutes have passed.The staff member smiled gently: \"It's okay, you can receive it.\"Jian Xingsui hesitated: \"But the regulations...\"\"It's okay, the rules are meant to be broken.\" The staff pointed to the corner where no one was around: \"Go there, just give me the phone after calling.\"That staff had never seen someone be so helpless and miserable.Jian Xingsui then picked up the phone and walked away.The staff looked at his back and sighed. It wasn't that he was willing to make an exception for Jian Xingsui. The main reason was that when the child just sat there, although he tried his best to restrain himself, the look in his eyes was so heartbreaking....The other side.Jian Xingsui answered the phone hesitantly, \"Hello.\"Father Zhang said, \"Hey, is it Xing Sui? I was busy in the store just now, so I didn't hear it.\"Jian Xingsui said quickly, \"It's alright.\"Although he was indeed really angry and a little emotional when he had left the house at that time, after a month, his anger from that time had long since disappeared. Seeing other people's parents taking such care of their children, he was vaguely looking forward to it, wondering if the Zhang couple would be able to give him some warmth too.He waited for a while, and heard Father Zhang say, \"Are you alright there?\"A smile slowly appeared on Jian Xingsui's face, and he said, \"I'm good.\"\"Ok then, tell me how is Ran Ran? Is he okay? How's he eating?\" Mother Zhang came over from the side: \"Did he have a hard time? I watched the live broadcast and he seemed to have lost a bit of weight.\"Jian Xingsui's hand tightened while holding the phone.Was An Ran tired?Maybe...But wasn't he tired?For practicing for a single performance, he lost five or six pounds, but who noticed that?Jian Xingsui said stiffly, \"He's okay, he's really okay.\"Mother Zhang sighed: \"That's good, then I can rest assured. I'm always worried about that child. By the way, Xing Sui, why are you calling us?\"Things had gotten till here, Jian Xingsui didn't want to invite them to visit at all. So he made a random reason: \"It's nothing, the program team wanted to fill in the blood types of our parents, what blood types are you guys?\"Father Zhang blurted out and thought about it: \"Oh, Type B\"Jian Xingsui frowned unconsciously: \"Type B? But I'm A?\"\"...\"There was dead silence on the other end of the phone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Jian Xingsui finished saying this, the two people on the other end of the phone were strangely silent for some reason. Such silence undoubtedly made Jian Xingsui's heart feel like it was covered with a layer of shadow. His heart slowly tightened, and his breathing began to slow.Just as he was suspicious, he heard Mother Zhang speak hurriedly as if to save her husband: \"Hahaha, don't get me wrong, I am blood type A, and your father is B.\"Jian Xingsui blinked a little suspiciously, but he had no choice but to nod: \"So it's like this.\"He said so, but he still had doubts in his heart because An Ran had filled A for both of their blood types. Among An Ran and this Zhang couple, there definitely was someone who was lying. Was it because they couldn't use the mobile phones here that these two parties hadn't gotten a chance to collude in their lies?\u00a0Jian Xingsui himself didn't know, but he was still filming the program, so even if he didn't know, for now, he could only continue listening to their lies.After hanging up the phone, Jian Xingsui returned the phone, but his mood at this time was somewhat different from before.Shen Xingchen came over and asked him, \"Will any one of your family members come for the next event?\"\"Ah? Not necessarily.\" Jian Xingsui said honestly, \"They probably won't come. They seem to be busy with work.\"Shen Xingchen sneered: \"Coming to see their child in the recording of the show is also not something for which they will lose face when they come ah. What kind of GREAT work can they possibly be busy with? Are they literally going to save the world?\"Jian Xingsui was suddenly speechless.Shen Xingchen was always straightforward and determined, but because of this, what he said was truly heart-warming. Others had time to come and see their children even if they had to put aside their millions of business activities. After a whole month of not seeing your child, even if it's little, parents would at least be looking forward to meeting their children, right?Love and dislike, these things about feelings were always too obvious.Jian Xingsui didn't feel the sadness he imagined. He just smiled lightly and said with emotion, \"Yes...you're right.\"...The next dayToday's hall was very lively.On the day contestants were to be visited by their parents or relatives, many contestants were very excited all day long. Many of them hadn't seen their family members for more than a month.In the early morning, mentors organized a gathering for all the students. Fu Jinxiao stood at the front. In order not to steal the limelight of the contestants, the handsome and elegant man wore loose and casual sportswear, but even so, the Film emperor Fu still stood out from all the people there. He had the charm of a mature man on his body, which made people unable to look away.\"This afternoon, your parents will come to the guildhall, so you should prepare your thoughts for your parents when they arrive.\" Fu Jinxiao pointed to the pen and paper on the table and said, \"Write down some of your wishes and prospects for the future, keep this letter, and give it to your family when your parents come.\"Everyone got the paper.Jian Xingsui was holding the paper but he didn't know how and what to write. Most of the people around him were writing. He was the only one who was staring at the white paper, but it would not be very good to do nothing, so he started to draw lightly.Until a voice came from the side: \"What did you draw?\"Jian Xingsui was stunned for a moment. He looked up and saw Fu Jinxiao standing beside him. He was a little nervous.\"I'm asking you something ne?\" Fu Jinxiao lowered his head: \"What did you draw?\"On that paper of Jian Xingsui, there were no words. There was only a drawing drawn with a black ink pen. There was a room in the drawing. There was a little person living in the room. There were some scattered things that looked like CDs. The room was very big, but somehow it looked entirely empty.\u00a0The little man was clearly surrounded by a lot of things, but he looked very lonely.Jian Xingsui opened his lips lightly: \"I drew a family.\"Family?Family with only one person?Fu Jinxiao remembered that today's theme was hope for the future. So Jian Xingsui's hope for the future was... to live solely?He hadn't gone to see the contestants making phone calls to their parents two days ago, but he had also heard some things. It was said that almost all the contestants got through the phone that day, but this child's phone was never answered, which was really pitiful and distressing.\"Is this the family you imagined in the future?\" Fu Jinxiao leaned down and looked at it with dark eyes. He didn't blame Jian Xingsui for not being a good painter, and he didn't ask him why he hadn't written a single word according to the rules. He just curled his lips and asked. : \"What is the little person in your drawing looking at?\"Jian Xingsui answered honestly, \"Watching TV.\"In his imagination, the life he looked forward to in the future was to have a house of his own.\u00a0Then he will have a smooth job, and he may pursue other careers in the future too. If it will all go smoothly, his life should be on the right track. After that, if he will have some spare time, he will silently pay attention to his idol and his life on the screen. It might have looked like ordinary and peaceful life, but the lessons of his previous life were still vivid in his mind. For him, it would be a luxury to live such a life all the time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe air pressure in the room seemed to drop to a freezing point.The assistant felt that the air pressure on Emperor Fu's body was very heavy, as if it could crush people to death. On weekdays, Emperor Fu was always smiling, but he was not angry, which made people very careful, but what he didn't expect was that, Fu Jinxiao, who was angry, was even more terrifying.Just when the assistant was carefully thinking about what to say, Fu Jinxiao put down the tablet and opened his lips: \"Call Meican.\"It was the manager.In general, the itinerary of the film emperor Fu does not need to be followed by a manager in person. After so many years in the circle, Film emperor Fu had a very strong business ability.\u00a0Basically, the itinerary can be completed in an orderly manner with the assistant without any accident, so the film emperor Fu rarely contacted his manager, or he didn't contact him at all.As soon as Wang Meican answered the phone, she immediately preempted: \"Hello, Jin Xiao, I saw that on Weibo.\"Professional managers always have excellent acuity and observation skills, and they will be aware of the wind direction and possible risks related to the artist in advance.\"This program team was really full of bastards. People in the industry could at a glance see that they were intentionally targeting people.\" Wang Meican couldn't stand it any longer: \"Moreover, the script they edited this time deliberately created contradictions, and they were very smart to target the more popular contestant.\u00a0It's really arrogant, but from the current form, it is obvious that Jian Anran, must have the capital to support, and his background may be very powerful and strong. \"Fu Jinxiao hooked his lips and sneered: \"Strong, how strong?\"Wang Meican finally heard the chill in Fu Jinxiao's words.\"So strong that they dared to use me as bait?\" Fu Jinxiao's words were full of irony: \"Then I really want to see how strong they are.\"Wang Meican thought he was disgusted with this kind of behavior, and quickly discouraged him and said:\u00a0\"Don't be angry, although the malicious editing this time does exist, the show team dare not use these methods on you.\"Fu Jinxiao: \"Nonsense, of course I know.\"Wang Meican was taken aback: \"Then you, what are you angry about?\"\"See the trending topic.\" Fu Jinxiao pointed to her concisely: \"In that part of the competition, the person I praised was Jian Xingsui.\"Wang Meican hurriedly went to Weibo to look around, and finally understood what her artist was referring to, and at the same time, her disgust for the program team naturally deepened: \"Did they have any feud with Jian Xingsui? They are even willing to let the audience curse this child? Or did this child offend someone and they want to punish him?\"Fu Jinxiao's hand was on the chair, and he tapped lightly, with a grim face: \"Whether he has offended anyone, I can't control it and I'm too lazy to care about it.\"\"but......\"The way he extended his voice almost sent his manager to hell's door.She heard Fu Jinxiao's cold voice saying: \"In recent years, the atmosphere of domestic entertainment has been getting worse and worse. Malicious control of votes, and capital exploitation, I don't take offense at these things, and I don't bother to care about it either.\u00a0But they dared to use my fans and popularity to target a contestant. Why??? I have been so good-tempered over the years that they have become so courageous now? \"After some remarks, the film emperor Fu's usual hypocritical face was finally torn off, but what really remained was a domineering man who was full of arrogance and ruffianism.Perhaps the impression he gave to everyone in the past was that he treated people and did things very elegantly and decently, and his popularity was very good. But that was only because with a good reputation and a kind face, it was convenient to do some things.\u00a0This doesn't mean that Fu Jinxiao is really easy to bully. If they had cared enough, they would have found that anyone who offended him in the early years did not have a good end today.Even though they have been together for many years, Wang Meican's heart trembled at this moment.\"Don't be angry, you are angry about a small talent show and a small artist who hasn't debuted yet. Are they worthy?\" She knew that this matter might be difficult to do, so she immediately said: \"You let go of this, I will immediately contact the program team to deal with it.\"Fu Jinxiao's tilted his head dangerously, and said, \"En, you handle it properly, and call me back later.\"''Remember, I said PROPERLY.''Wang Meican hurriedly said, \"Okay, please give the phone to the assistant, and I'll have a word with her.\"She has to talk to the assistant and must be optimistic about this ancestor. In the past few years, Fu Jinxiao's identity has risen, and the entertainment industry has never seen anyone who could compete with him. Very few people dared to offend him. So nothing had happened till now. Not to mention this very daring show crew, even she had forgotten the real temper of this ancestor. So Wang Meican was really afraid that Fu Jinxiao will suddenly launch an attack to the director team on a whim because he had been holding his temper back for a few years.The assistant responded quickly.However, when she came back, she saw that the film emperor Fu who had just stopped for a while, was looking at the tablet again.Fu Jinxiao was swiping the recent hot searches. This time, it really seemed that various marketing accounts of the program team were organized to target Jian Xingsui. The next moment, he even saw it on the official Weibo, where some netizens said:\"Brother Fu likes Ran Ran very much, which shows that the character of this child must be really good.\"\"I'm also a fan of Brother Fu, brother's vision will not be wrong, I want to vote for An Ran.\"\"The two of them actually look pretty good.\"Then, someone actually released some maliciously put together animations from these episodes. Among them, there was actually an animation of An Ran holding a thermos bucket and asking him if he wanted to eat. The film emperor Fu was born with a pair of passionate peach blossom eyes. Everyone seems to have their own emotions, and this GIF has been specially added with pink bubbles, which naturally adds a lot of ambiguous atmosphere.The following many brainless netizens started again:\"Fairy Love~\"\"Film emperor really likes An Ran.\"\"Jian Xingsui is really annoying, and I don't know on what basis to compare him with Ran Ran.\"What's even more deadly was that under this cp comment, there was actually a comment that was liked by the Weibo account of an official staff of the program team, which directly led to this comment being seen by more people and misled even more people.Like?Fu Jinxiao's mouth evoked a sneer, \"Dear program team, I seem to have 'liked' your whole ancestors.\"...The assistant who answered the manager's call just came back and was about to speak when she saw Fu Jinxiao who was sitting on the sofa throwing the tablet aside and stood up.\u00a0The hostility in his body had not yet retreated, and the man's stature was tall, which made her feel oppressive.The assistant asked tremblingly, \"Brother, where are you going?\"Fu Jinxiao took the coat on the sofa, lifted his eyelids to look at her. His dark eyes were fucking dark. He turned around without looking back, and left a sentence: \"Sports Center.\"That's where the show was being filmed.Poor Wang Meican wanted to say a few words.......but never mind. She could only tell the assistant to keep watch and don't let this grandfather go to the scene. This unreliable employer of hers was really too unreliable.SIGH!!!...At night,The twilight was deep, and someone came in through the main entrance of the gymnasium, as if there was still a chill of night.Fu Jinxiao walked in. He passed through the second floor first, where he happened to pass the contestant's cafeteria. At this moment, all the contestants were just having their meals. Some of the contestants who had finished their meals were facing the outside in twos and threes.\u00a0Uninterested, the film emperor Fu, who wanted to turn a corner, saw Jian Xingsui who just finished eating.The eyes met, and there was silence.Fu Jinxiao's originally repressed emotions suddenly didn't know why emerged when he saw the little bald head's naive face. A small smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, and he felt much more relaxed. He waved to him: \"Come here.\"Jian Xingsui was still a little dazed at first, not sure if he was calling himself.Fu Jinxiao remained patient. He bent his hands again and called the other out like a puppy, but Jian Xingsui really ran over.\"Brother Fu.\" Jian Xingsui was panting, looking up at Fu Jinxiao with bright eyes as if they were shining: \"Why are you here?\"Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows: \"I can't come?\"Jian Xingsui shook his head: \"But this is not the time for your recording. They all said that you had an announcement, so you went to rush the announcement.\"Fu Jinxiao said \"Oh?\", half-jokingly: \"You are unexpectedly quite well-informed..... do you usually inquire so much about me?\"\"No!\" Jian Xingsui subconsciously wanted to refute, but it seemed that the movie emperor was right in saying so. He lowered his head a little embarrassedly, his earlobes dyed red involuntarily, and he tried to explain in a low voice, \"I just heard someone say that when they were chatting before.\"Fu Jinxiao was in a better mood when he saw the cute appearance of his simple explanation.The assistant who hurriedly followed behind originally came to persuade him not to fight, but when he came running his ass out, he saw the film emperor Fu lowering his head and talking to a certain contestant, with a smile on his lips. He was looking down at the person with a very gentle gaze.Like Bruhhhhhh....Even this dangerous Fu could see someone with this kind of gaze........Mom ! I want to resign.Different from those fake and distant polite eyes, it is the kind of tenderness that seemed to overflow with water. This was the look that the assistant had not seen even once.However, then the assistant heard Fu Jinxiao speak: \"You are training here, do you know what is going on with the edited version that was released today?\"Jian Xingsui, who was talking to him, paused, and finally nodded lightly: \"We don't have mobile phones, but some people do. They somehow told me something.\"Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, a little surprised: \"Aren't you sad?\"The child Jian Xingsui usually looks silly, but what Fu Jinxiao didn't expect was that the child could look so calm before such a huge grievance.Jian Xingsui said honestly, \"It's okay.\"Fu Jinxiao looked down at him: \"About that part where I praised you, it being edited...\"Jian Xingsui obviously also knew about this. The praise he received was edited as if the one receiving it was someone else.\u00a0He should have been very angry, but he pondered for a while, then raised his head and smiled gently: \"Well, I know, I'm actually quite fortunate.\"Fu Jinxiao frowned, displeased: \"Fortunate?\"\"Yes.\" Jian Xingsui's voice was soft: \"Some of the things edited by the program group previously were enough to make many people hate me. If at this time, Brother Fu would have praised me, maybe they would have been angry with you. \"Jian Xingsui looked at his clear and clean eyes. At this time, he swallowed all his grievances, and said with some relief, \"Fortunately, you were not involved.\"\"...\"There was a moment of silence in the air.Fu Jinxiao's dark eyes looked at Jian Xingsui. There seemed to be turbulent waves that made people dare not look at him directly.Then, he sneered.He has always been a smiling person in front of Jian Xingsui. At this moment, the dark side of the iceberg seemed to be revealed. Fu Jinxiao reached out and squeezed Jian Xingsui's face with a little force.Jian Xingsui immediately gave a \"uh\" and took a step back to escape the ravages. He whispered, \"It hurts.\"Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows: \"You still know the pain, I thought you were heartless.\"Heartless little thing.He has been angry with insignificant people for this little heartless thing for half a day, and this........... this guy right now was talking nonsense here.Jian Xingsui looked up at him, with a little mist in his eyes. It was unknown if it was because of being pinched, or because of what the show team had done, he finally felt wronged and didn't speak.Fu Jinxiao lowered his body, and his tone turned much softer unconsciously: \"It really hurts? I obviously didn't use much strength.\"Jian Xingsui shook his head: \"No, it doesn't hurt.\"It would have been fine if this little thing took the opportunity to show his emotions but he was still so obedient. Fu Jinxiao looked at the person in front of him and sighed again in his heart. He said, \"Little boy, you are so arrogant.\u00a0That was the praise I gave you. So what's the matter with you just letting it go to others??? So you don't take me seriously? \"Jian Xingsui was shocked. He didn't expect to be so misunderstood, so he quickly said, \"No, Brother Fu, that's not what I meant.\"But Fu Jinxiao waved his hand and said, \"It's alright, I understand, I forgive you for not having the guts. Isn't your dormitory going to gather on time to practice dancing? Go back quickly.\"Jian Xingsui also thought of this, he hesitated for a while, but still stretched out his hand: \"Well, then I'll go.\"Fu Jinxiao: \"Yeah.\"He stood there and watched Jian Xingsui leave with small footsteps. Over the years, as his status increased, he was almost always watched by others. He rarely watched other people's backs, but this time, he stood in the corridor and watched Jian Xingsui's departure. He obviously was only in his 20s, but for some reason, his back looked so lonely.The assistant whispered, \"Brother...\"Fu Jinxiao opened his lips: \"What do you think of him?\"\"Me.\" The little assistant followed his gaze, smiled softly, and said, \"I think this child, at first glance, doesn't seem to be easy to get along with, but he actually feels pretty good at the bottom of his heart. Well, he's very well-behaved, no wonder you praised him.\"Fu Jinxiao nodded lightly: \"Yeah.\"At that time, he hadn't praised him on a whim, on the contrary, he had done it on purpose.He didn't know why, this child always had a strong sense of inferiority and cowardice. No matter how hard he tried to hide it, Fu Jinxiao was still sensitive to it.\u00a0He didn't know what Jian Xingsui had experienced, but he began to pay more attention to this child unconsciously and tried to give encouragement at the right time.Also, he wanted to get the attention of that child.That's quite embarrassing but.....So what?That's right, he is selfish. Film emperor Fu has been in the entertainment industry for many years, with a huge number of fans.\u00a0Of course, he understands that his favorable impression of a contestant on the show will give his fans a hint of what kind of heart he has for that contestant. It would have helped Jian Xingsui with his ranking as well.Of course, the program team also recognized this, so they took this key scene to An Ran, which seemed to be just malicious editing, but in fact it cut off many resources that should have been originally given to Jian Xingsui. This was also the reason why Fu Jinxiao was angry. He gave Jian Xingsui an opportunity, but it became a stepping stone for others....\"Mr. Fu, why are you here so late?\"A somewhat crisp and weak voice suddenly sounded behind him. Fu Jinxiao turned around and saw An Ran.An Ran should have just returned from the cafeteria. He was wearing a white training suit and looked like a youthful young boy. He was clean and beautiful at this age. There was a reason for him being one of the most popular contestants.\u00a0It has to be said that An Ran's appearance was very dominant. As the assistant said, someone looks easy to get along with at first glance, while someone looks hard to get along with at a glance.Nobody knew this is what a legendary ''halo'' was. That was the difference between the protagonist's ''halo'' and a mere cannon fodder's ''halo''.(T/N: Oh boy, that's why I am so unliked...)Fu Jinxiao said in a low voice, \"Come and ask the program crew for something.\"\"About what?\" An Ran asked subconsciously, then he covered his lips and said apologetically, \"I'm sorry brother, I didn't want to inquire about your privacy.\"\"Did you come... because of things about Weibo today?\" Obviously, An Ran was the type of person in this group who had a mobile phone, and he was also a very smart type who could stand in front of the Film Emperor Fu with a ''weak'' face. He said weakly and anxiously: \"I also watched a little bit. I don't know why the show team edited it so much that it doesn't seem to be good for others.\"A sarcastic smile crossed Fu Jinxiao's eyes.But An Ran thought he was approving, and only bit his lip before speaking softly: \"I really didn't expect this to happen.\u00a0In fact, I also wanted to talk to the director, but the program has already been edited, and it is not up to me to decide.\u00a0Seeing Xing Sui's face today, he doesn't look very good, I feel guilty and worried to death. After a period of time, during live broadcast, I must find an opportunity to clarify for him in front of the audience. \"To simply listen, what a beautiful thing he just said.Not only showed his kindness and beauty but also cleared his relationship.Even Fu Jinxiao, who has been in the entertainment industry for many years, had to admire that An Ran's ability was still quite strong. If it were someone else, they might have really applauded his thoughtfulness, but it's a pity that he met himself.The film emperor Fu hooked his lips and said slowly: \"Is that so?\"An Ran nodded vigorously.\"Then I'll give you this chance.\" Fu Jinxiao said slowly, \"How about you go and tell the director what you said again?\"An Ran's face changed instantly. He definitely hadn't expected Fu Jinxiao to say that, and he hesitated: \"This....... mainly because the show has already been broadcast, I can't change it immediately if I talk about it now, Besides, I'm just a contestant...\"Fu Jinxiao sneered.An Ran raised his head and met the man's good-looking phoenix eyes.\u00a0And those eyes, which were usually careless, seemed to be drenched in coldness at this moment. An Ran was shocked when he saw it as if those careful eyes had already seen everything through him.Fu Jinxiao stepped forward and said in a low voice, \"Kidding, I'm going.\"The assistant hurriedly followed. He looked at An Ran a few more times and followed up with his own actor.After a while, the door of the director's team was kicked open.\u00a0The director who was still on the phone inside turned around in shock and saw the man standing at the door.\u00a0Leaning on the door, he seemed to have the usual faint smile on his face and was looking at himself. Even though Fu Jinxiao was smiling, the director felt inexplicably cold behind him, as if the king of hell was coming to claim his life.\"Director.\" Fu Jinxiao said slowly: \"Good evening.\"The director quickly put down the phone and stood up earnestly: \"Mr. Fu, why are you here? You didn't say anything about coming here. I would have picked you up at your door.\"\"I don't dare.\" Fu Jinxiao pulled out a chair and sat down, his slender thighs overlapped, and his aura was strong: \"How can I trouble the director to pick me up?\"The cold sweat broke down on the director's back from the fear of those sarcastic words. He hurriedly smiled: \"No No Mr. Fu, how can it be a trouble to pick you up?\"\"Really?\" Fu Jinxiao lifted his eyelids to look at him: \"Then the editing of this week's episode doesn't seem to have been edited by the director.\"The director knew that this ancestor was not in a good mood, so he bit the bullet and said, \"The editing of this episode is a bit problematic. We are thinking about improving it next time...\"\"Don't do it next time. Just do it this time.\" Fu Jinxiao grinned, as if he was polite and reasonable, \"I'm also not someone who is not easy to talk to, so take this issue off the shelves and replace it with a correct clip.\"...Didn't he just say he was easy to talk to? !Myan...............Everyone in the room was shocked. This Fu dude is almost acting like a bandit, right?The director really had a hard time and said hesitantly, \"Brother Fu, it's not that I don't want to, in fact, Jian Xingsui is a really good kid. We all know that he is a talented guy and works very hard, but this time, this time... ...Did you know that the biggest investor in our show is the Jian family. They have come to sign the contract long ago, and they even gave An Ran a fixed debut place. They even made their extra request a few days ago. \"Fu Jinxiao opened his lips: \"What request?\"\"They wanted to eliminate Jian Xingsui.\" The director was now willing to give up. Compared with offending the Jian family, offending Fu Jinxiao will be riskier.\u00a0He had already heard about the actor's ability and the degree of craziness, so at this moment he could only tell the truth: \"We were also in a dilemma, originally thinking that a contestant without a background should be secretly voted out or given fewer shots. It seemed to be very simple, but unexpectedly...\"The assistant director also came over and said, \"What we didn't expect was that the young son of the Shen family went to hang with Jian Xingsui for some reason!\"The director was also worried: \"You know the Shen family, the Shen family has already signed a contract for us, how can we offend them as well. Shen Xingchen is definitely going to debut, in order to support him, it is necessary to give him more shots. Who would have known that the young master had a very good relationship with Jian Xingsui for some reason, and pulled him to show him on the camera.\"As a result, everything was uncontrollable like a wild horse that had taken off the reins. Jian Xingsui's popularity was extremely high, and even reached a peak this week and became a popular contestant!How can this man be eliminated when his existence now could make a difference?The director team had no choice but to start with the edited version, and wanted to use this to see if they could operate a wave behind the scenes.Unexpectedly, the problem of the Jian family was about to be solved, and now he has provoked a big Buddha again. The director was also suffering in his heart now, and his legs were a little weak now.After Fu Jinxiao listened quietly, his slender fingers tapped on the armrest of the chair, and hooked his lips: \"You are afraid of offending the Jian family?\"The director nodded slightly.\"Then you aren't afraid to offend me?\" Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, his face was warm, but what he said made everyone's heart rise: \"Is that so?\"The director hurriedly said, \"Mr. Fu, I'm really sorry, I'll apologize to you for this. Do you think this is the case? Then let's release a separate version and release the full version of the episode, how about it?\"This is the biggest concession the show team has made.Before, Fu Jinxiao might have agreed, but at this moment, he inexplicably thought of how the child in the corridor had endured his sadness and had said, \"Fortunately, you are not involved.\"He also seemed to have a faint understanding that maybe Jian Xingsui was not really passive about the show from the beginning, but had long expected that he would not go far? Therefore, even being edited maliciously, he could face it calmly, as if he knew his ending for a long time....He didn't know why, thinking of this, Fu Jinxiao felt bad in his heart.If he was not happy, others should not be happy.So Fu Jinxiao opened his lips lightly under the eager eyes of the director team: \"No.\"The director was tortured to death by this ancestor. After listening to the words, it was like being struck by lightning, and he wanted to cry without tears.Just when Fu Jinxiao was about to speak again, the assistant director's phone rang again. After he answered it, he listened to a few words, and quickly took the phone to the director and said, \"Director, it's Mr. Shen's phone.\"The director was surprised: \"What is Mr. Shen calling for?\"The assistant director secretly glanced at the film Emperor Fu, and his heart was a little broken, but he could only bite the bullet and say:\u00a0\"Mr. Shen said that, as an investor of the program group, he was very dissatisfied with the content of the edited version of the program that was put on the shelves this time. He thinks that An Ran has too many shots and too much centrality, and it seems that his younger brother has a low sense of existence, and the money he invested in our show was obviously not utilized properly. \"The director's heart collapsed, and he said to the other end of the phone with some trembling: \"Mr. Shen, what do you mean?\"\"En\" Shen Minglang seemed to be watching the fun and didn't think it was a big deal. Mr. Shen, who has always been shrewd and mercenary, gave an ultimatum: \"I mean that you should immediately re-edit a version and put it on the shelves, otherwise, the investment amount of the next issue, I might have to reconsider.''Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Shen Minglang said that sentence, the director felt that he was shattered.This time, the investors and even mentors who were invited were from big companies. The production team had felt they were really lucky to be able to invite Fu Jinxiao. When the list of the investors and the mentors was finalized, it was the director and the program crew who had been so excited that they couldn't sleep for three days and three nights. But what they didn't expect was those three days and nights' worth of celebration would cost them be suppressed in this way where they clearly have no way out.When comparing the Shen family and the Jian family, they both were the most prominent investors. But of course, the Shen family was superior. Originally, the Shen family never specifically proposed to give Shen Xingchen any preferential treatment. Only the Jian family always asked the program team to do this and that. So the program team had thought since the Shen family was not gonna talk anyway so they could serve this fatherly Jian family without offending the other investors. AND TIME PROVED THEY WERE TOO NAIVE!Now that even the Shen family has spoken, now everything must be reconsidered.In front of them, there was an ancestor. Fu Jinxiao was a well-recognized and dedicated artist in the industry, but it did not mean that he was a good talker. If you really put the choice between offending Jian and Shen families together and offending Fu Jinxiao, the director will definitely choose to offend the two families. Because offending the two families at most means this show can't go on but offending Fu Jinxiao means he will not survive in the entire entertainment industry.Now that the two angry ancestors have spoken, the director already knows how to choose.\"Okay.\" The director decided to back down: \"Actually, we also felt that there was something wrong with the previous version. Tomorrow at the latest, we will release the full version and specially edited version to the audience.\"Shen Minglang was satisfied: \"Yes, I like to deal with smart partners.\"The director looked at Fu Jinxiao again.The smiling tiger sitting in the chair also showed a satisfied smile: \"Director, how come you are so hardworking.\"HEHEThe director's heart was full of bullshit, and he could only force a smile and say, \"You two are really polite, this is what we should do.\"............At a place, where no one could see, the previously smiling tiger slowly spoke and commanded mockingly, ''Daring to hurt my fan, make sure the director will have a very good time in the industry from now on. As for others, I naturally have my own ways to make them kneel!''.........After hanging up the phone with the ass director, Shen Minglang looked at his parents behind him.Xu Enzhen said, \"Mingming, did you properly remind him?\"Shen Minglang nodded and said, \"Well, it's settled, they promised to re-release a version.\"\"That's good, that's good.\" Xu Enzhen finally breathed a sigh of relief and smiled gently: \"This way, we can give justice to that child.\"Father Shen, who was sitting on the sofa, said, \"That child Xingchen, how old is he? He still calls his family to complain! How insulting!\"Just in the afternoon, Shen Xingchen, who finally got his mobile phone secretly, complained and called the landline at home, and complained like a primary school student for a long time. There were two specific points.\u00a0The first was that one of his roommates had worked hard to win the game, but there were not many scenes given to him. The second was to sue the program team for malicious editing and bullying of his little brother, which was unbearable.Xu Enzhen comforted her husband: \"What fart are you talking about, the child is wronged outside, why can't he tell the family. If the child really swallows the wronged words, can you be happy?\"Father Shen snorted coldly but didn't say anything.The family-style of the Shen family is to protect the people they care about. Shen Minglang dislikes his younger brother for being like a primary school student, but he still contacted the program team immediately to deal with this matter.After finishing calling, Shen Minglang sat down on the sofa and asked his mother, \"You seem to like that kid Jian Xingsui very much, what's the reason?\"Xu Enzhen was suddenly questioned and remained stunned for a while. She then recovered, and smiled lightly: \"Mingming, maybe you don't know, but this child, he looks really similar to you and your brother. As soon as I saw him, I felt as if I saw you and your brother. I felt like he was my own child.\"Shen Minglang looked at his mother with a slight smile and suddenly became a little ecstatic.Back then, when Xu Enzhen was pregnant with her third child, it wasn't actually the best time to get pregnant. At that time, she was a little weak, but she persisted all the time. After giving birth, she, unfortunately, bled heavily.\u00a0At that time, everyone was in chaos, but they didn't expect that after rescuing the pregnant woman, bad news came from the incubator. The child who was expected by everyone, and Mrs. Xu gave birth to risking her life, suffered a cardiac arrest the night after he was born.Xu Enzhen suffered from postpartum depression. In severe cases, she even had hallucinations and started talking nonsense. Many times, she would wake up from a dream, and then tell her family that she felt that her youngest son was not dead.The Shen family saw the pain in her heart.It took about five or six years for Xu Enzhen to slowly come out of that shadow, but it wasn't completely. As the two sons grew up and left, the family became more and more deserted, and even Shen Minglang once heard the servants say, the madam often huddles herself in the young master's baby room, and stays there for an entire afternoon.Even that year, when Shen Xingchen graduated, Xu Enzhen went to participate in his school activities. At that time, a few students happened to come out of the corridor, and they happened to chat with her for a while. After learning their ages, she stood up suddenly. She stood there and watched for a long time, then smiled bitterly and said, \"You guys turned out to be so big.......as big as him..........\"The departure of that child was a pain for the Shen family.Shen Minglang also felt that he himself somehow had an inexplicable affection for Jian Xingsui, but he was a little puzzled: \"I went there a few days ago and saw that there seemed to be some other trainees who had bad opinions of him. It seemed that it was because of some things he had done, and there were some problems with his character.\"\"Mingming, didn't your mother teach you, don't judge someone's character based on some words from someone else's mouth.\"Xu Enzhen glared at the child: \"If you say that, isn't our family Chenchen a devil?\"Shen Minglang hooked his lips and smiled, but he had to admit it.Xu Enzhen sighed again and said: \"Actually, I really don't know much about the child Jian Xingsui, I just think, a child who can only hide and cry alone in a dark area when he is wronged so that no one could see his tears, no matter how bad he is, how bad can he be??\"She really didn't mean to help anyone.It's just that when she changed her mind a little and thought that if her youngest son was still alive and he also suffered such grievances, she felt distressed and unacceptable....The next day,The full version of the previously edited video was launched on major video platforms.After watching the full version, the netizens exploded. Some of them expressed their emotions by cursing, and some even went to the official blog of the program group with a banner and said: \u3010Asshole editor, get out and be ready to die! \u3011Although the program has only been broadcasted for a short period of one or two months, many trainees have entered the public's field of vision because of this, and many people have gained a lot of fans because of this, including Jian Xingsui who actually has many fans as well.\u00a0In the previous wave, the reason why most of the fans were silent was mainly because they couldn't cover the overwhelmingly negative comments, so they had to be silent.And today, the grievances were snowing, and no one was very rude to brush off their presence everywhere. Only under the official blog of the program a fan calmly typed a sentence, but it quickly became a hot comment. The comment was short but very moving:\"I was not that sad, but I can't imagine how sad he will be when he sees that edited version.\"Just a few words, but it hurt like a needle pierced the heart.In the face of the unfair editing, Jian Xingsui could only swallow his grievances silently.\u00a0And if the full version had not been exposed, how many times would he have to silently swallow the pain.\u00a0This time it was exposed, so what about those things that were not exposed. They didn't dare to think about it, they just felt shocked.Many people who once criticized Jian Xingsui disappeared. They used to be very active, but now they have disappeared like the world only had good people now. My god how fake those people were. They didn't even ask for an apology. Even at this time, there were many fans of other contestants. An Ran's fans still praised An Ran's beauty and talent under the full version.Only this time, unlike before, some netizens felt disgusted.Finally, someone started to point out:\"I think An Ran is getting too much praise unnecessarily.\"\"His footage really annoys me.\"\"The people around me don't actually like An Ran much, but why is his vote so high?\"\"Everyone had been bragging about his appearance and strength before. In fact, from the full version, many other little brothers are equally good-looking as well.\"When the marketing is done excessively, it will lead to a very terrible backlash.Slowly, more and more people began to focus on Jian Xingsui and the other contestants, and even more, those with sharp eyes discovered a problem:\"Have you noticed that Xingsui and Xingchen look alike?\"\"Oh my sister, someone finally spoke my mind.\"\"Hahaha, these two call themselves brothers every day, can you do a paternity test?\"People had started to put forward such remarks just to be happy about their cp, but some people naturally were not so happy.Zhang's husband and wife put down their mobile phones slowly. The room was silent, both of them seemed to be in deep thought, and the atmosphere was a little scary.After quite a while,Zhang Xiangyang sighed softly: \"Wife, shall we surrender?\"\"Surrender what!\" Zhang Xia suddenly became very terrified: \"As long as we don't say it, no one will find out!\"Zhang Xiangyang looked at his crazy wife and sighed again in his heart.In that hospital, his wife used to be a working nurse. Coincidentally, she gave birth to a child there. It was almost the same day as the children of the Jian family and the Shen family. Unfortunately, their child's heart stopped almost as soon as he was born.Zhang Xiangyang felt that his wife could not accept this incident and would collapse, and actually made the biggest mistake in their life. The monitoring system was not so developed in those days. Relying on her familiarity with the hospital, she avoided the monitoring and changed the child in the incubator.\u00a0It was the Shen family's child that she held at the beginning, but she knew that the mother was weak when she gave birth to the child and was worried that the child would not be healthy when he grew up, so she also exchanged with another family.In fact, all they needed to do was to put the child back, but at that time, his wife just learned of the death of the child, and her mind was not very clear, so she did a very outrageous behavior in a panic. When Zhang Xiangyang found out, everything had gone wrong, and was too late....Zhang Xiangyang said to his wife, \"Axia, after so many years, Ran Ran has gone home. Let's let Jian Xingsui go home too.\"Zhang Xia didn't know it was right. She burst into tears: \"It would be fine if it was an ordinary family, but it is the Shen family with one hand covering the sky. It's not like you don't know what Mrs. Shen looked like back then, if they know the culprit is the two of us, wouldn't they send us to hell?\"Having said this, Zhang Xiangyang also hesitated.Zhang Xia said: \"Even if we don't say it, Jian Xingsui will still be able to live, but if we say it, we won't necessarily live. He can't be so selfish. If it's a big deal, we will just treat that child better or move out of this place together. I believe he shouldn't blame us either.\"(T/N:\u00a0 how to kill virtual characters?)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was still about a week before the start of the second public voting round, and the voting ranking of the first public voting round will be announced in the next two days.Wen Shengge kept saying in the morning, \"Will I be eliminated...\"In fact, most people already had mobile phones.But during the last two days, the program team confiscated their phones again.\u00a0The ranking may rise and fall every day. Wen Shengge has always been a rather sentimental boy, so at this moment, he has been babbling about his ranking not being ideal, so he is very worried.Jian Xingsui was washing his face outside, next to Shen Xingchen who was also brushing his teeth and washing his face.Shen Xingchen looked at him while brushing his teeth, annoyed: \"Why are you staring at me all the time, do I have eye mucus in my eyes?\"Jian Xingsui shook his head slowly. He hesitated for a while, and finally summoned up the courage to say, \"Xingchen, thank you for this time!\"?Shen Xingchen said, \"What's the matter?\"Jian Xingsui was taken aback for a moment, and explained, \"That.......about the program team releasing the unedited version.\"\"Oh that thing.\" Shen Xingchen rinsed his mouth with the water in the water cup, and then said, \"Why do you care about this, I don't care about it.\"Jian Xingsui knew that this might be just a little effort for Shen Xingchen, but for himself, it was a solution to a huge problem. He was used to relying on himself for a long time, especially after An Ran appeared, no matter what happened, what kind of grievance he suffered, no one listened to him. When it was too much, he would still think about explaining it at first, but later he found that his words were all just a joke.Suddenly being helped by others, his first reaction was not to be happy, but to think about how to repay, how to be grateful, and for a while, he was a bit at a loss.\"I still want to thank you.\" Jian Xingsui said softly, \"You have helped me a lot.\"Shen Xingchen fetched water and washed his face in the basin, saying: \"Then don't just thank me. The only thing I did was to call my home and complain. To thank sincerely, you have to thank my parents, thank my brother, oh, and I heard that Brother Fu also contributed.\"Jian Xingsui was stunned: \"Brother Fu?\"Shen Xingchen nodded: \"Yes.\"Brother Fu also contributed?Why?Is it because he felt that the program team also maliciously edited him, so he did that?It can't be... because of himself, right?But Shen Xingchen said, \"I heard from my brother later that he hadn't seen him get so angry for a long time. He didn't expect that this time because of you, he was actually so angry.\"Jian Xingsui couldn't believe it: \"Angry? Brother Fu? Because of me? It's unlikely.\"Shen Xingchen wiped his face and sighed: \"Why are you always so unconfident, you are not worse than others.\"You are not worse than others.This sentence was like a silent hammer, hitting Jian Xingsui's heart ruthlessly, with endless echoes.Jian Xingsui swallowed all the words in his mouth. He was still speechless and didn't know how to answer this when Shen Xingchen patted his shoulder, and the fuckboy Shen gave him a firm look: \"Maybe before you indeed were bad, but now you are my little brother, so you can be confident so as not to embarrass me.\"\"...\"This fuck boy speech made Jian Xingsui's heart suddenly feel moved and didn't know how to reply.After washing up, the group went to the main hall to gather. The cameramen there have been waiting for a long time. From the moment the contestant left the dormitory, they began to follow the filming.The audience had been waiting for a long time:\"My un-biological son, long time no see.\"1\"In order to see you handsome pigs, I even set an alarm clock.\"\"Hahaha, I'm not even this much active on my dates as these trainees are now.\"\"Not being able to see you, babies, for days, mother thinks about you guys days and nights!\"The contestants gathered in the main hall, where the mentors were already waiting.The four mentors also looked very energetic today. Mr. Li was still hosting in his cool and expensive leather jacket. Ms. Tuya looked bright and beautiful in a skirt today. As for film emperor Fu, he was wearing casual gray sportswear today. It was just an ordinary classic sports style, but when this man wore it, it emitted a foreign and noble feeling.When entering the venue, there were still many contestants chatting with laughter. After entering the venue, when they saw the film emperor Fu standing there cooly while just quietly glancing over them, they immediately shut up.After everyone obediently stood in line, mentor Li said, \"Hello everyone!\"The contestants said in unison, \"Hello, mentor!\"Teacher Li said with a smile: \"I heard that the program team has invited a lot of dance and vocal music teachers to train for you in the past few days. Everyone has suffered a lot, right?\"2That sentence triggered a lot of resentment.\"I'm so tired, mentor.\"\"After practicing for so many days, my legs are sore now.\"\"Forget it, I forgive this ''good'' program team.\"''Don't even mention it.''That seemed to be what Teacher Li wanted to hear. He smiled slightly and said, \"So, today is our special game session. Let's play a game together and have a good time. There are rich rewards for those who win!\"Everyone was shocked after hearing this.Mr. Li quickly began to read out the rules of the game this time. As he spoke, the staff of the show team also began to come in with plates. On it, there were signs divided into two colors: red and blue.\"In this competition, we will divide more than 100 contestants into two groups through random selection. The two groups are hostile to each other. You have to steal each other's brand names to add points to your own. After the competition, the two groups will be given their scores.\u00a0The team with the highest score wins, and the winner can enjoy a luxurious hot pot feast, as well as the privilege to know their current stage ranking. \"This was simply a battle royale, and the rules of the game can be directly summed up as: making trouble.Some contestants raised their hands and asked, \"Mentor, how do you divide two groups?\"Fu Jinxiao, who had been standing there lazily, picked up the mike and answered, \"Draw lots at random and go forward in order.\"If it was random, the former friends might also become enemies. Now many trainees had begun to look at their friends meaningfully. The good brothers in normal times showed smiles worthy of careful consideration at this meeting.Shen Xingchen said to Jian Xingsui, \"You properly pray, you must have the same color as mine, ok?\"Jian Xingsui told him the cruel truth: \"It's all about luck, it's useless to say it.\"\"How do you know that we won't draw the same color.\" Shen Xingchen resented: \"Will our luck be so miserable?\"\"...\"Everyone was lining up to draw lots.Many former friends who had gotten the different colors now started to show their true colors.For example,''Little ass, do you remember about the morning incident, how you came out of the toilet 3.42 minutes late? Do you know how hard it was for me to hold back? Fake! You are a fake buddy, see how I will teach you a lesson?''''HA!!! Myaan I remember you had a very good time twisting my butt before, didn't you? Just watch how this old man will twist your luck in this game!''When it was Jian Xingsui's turn, he went to the bucket to draw a ball, and finally caught a blue ball, and Shen Xingchen behind him caught a red ball.Jian Xingsui smiled helplessly and said, \"See?\"\"How could this be.\" The young master looked at the red ball with dissatisfaction. He looked at Jian Xingsui threateningly, pinched his waist and said, \"Okay, you are now my enemy, a traitor of our group. Just wait, this young master will definitely take down your brand name later! \"Jian Xingsui said, \"Why are you targeting me?\"Shen Xingchen said confidently: \"Who told you not to be with me?\"...This guy was so domineering, that he couldn't reply at all.After almost all the players had been divided into two groups, the situation had gradually become clear. Facts have proved that Jian Xingsui was indeed the one with the worst luck among them. His dormitory was full of people with red balls, and only he had blue.(T/N: HAHA People with BALLS! red BALLS and blue BALLS. HAHAHAHA I can't...)And according to his observation, An Ran also had a blue BALL. (T/N: HAHAHA)A contestant asked, \"Mentors, are you also participating?\"Tuya smiled slightly and said, \"Yes, although we can't tell you about our colors for the time being, what I can tell you is that our brand name has double points.\"As soon as the words came out, everyone was shocked.The contestants exploded. This fatherfucking program team! Double points ah!What a temptation it was, the brand names of the mentors were too expensive. Who wouldn't be moved by a brand with double points? But who in the world would dare to tear up the mentor's brand, what a leopard would do that?The audience in the live broadcast room became more and more excited:\"This damn program team is quite talented at doing things!\"\"Hahaha, I want to see who will tear the Brother Fu's brand name.\"\"GKDGKD!\"1The staffs of the program team took everyone to the outside of the hall and then said: \"You will enter the hall in batches according to the order of drawing lots. All the rooms and passages here have become your covered passages. Now we will open the Star Bean exchange system, and students with Star Beans can exchange for self-defense weapons. \"The table there could be said to be dazzling.For example, water guns, smoke bombs, glue, toy balls, binoculars, ropes, bells, everything was available. The price of each star bean was different, and rich people could buy more.Shen Xingchen can be said to be the richest. He quickly gathered his roommates and the contestants who had trained together to form a small team. This meeting was simply in order to allocate supplies. Almost all the props had been bought, and Jian Xingsui was relatively poor. He thought about it and only bought a smoke bomb.Teacher Li said: \"The countdown is 10 seconds, the game is about to start...!\"The inexplicable atmosphere at the scene began to get a little tense.Jian Xingsui was among the second group to go in. The hall was empty and no one was seen.\u00a0But not far from the third floor, there seemed to be someone's mourning. After a while, the female voice broadcasted through the whole gymnasium: \"Student Zhang Jianshen No. 57 is eliminated, and the red team has added one point.\"Someone's name tag had already been torn off.Jian Xingsui glanced at the blue name tag on his waist and sighed heavily. As far as he knows, the two groups of people entering this venue were almost all in teams, and he was the only one who acted alone. Therefore, it was unrealistic to fight recklessly with others.\"Find a place to hide,\" he thought.The first place that came to his mind was the canteen.There were a lot of seats there. If someone came in, he would definitely directly hear their movements, which could have a certain warning effect. In addition, there were many doors in the kitchen, and even if exposed, the possibility of escape was relatively large. Adding to the fact that the kitchen was also so wide, it was a good place for both offense and defense.After making up his mind, Jian Xingsui didn't hesitate, and immediately got up and ran to the kitchen. The third batch of contestants there hadn't come in yet, and there were not too many people, as long as he was careful enough not to meet people from the red team.He couldn't take the elevator, maybe someone was guarding it.Jian Xingsui didn't drive away from the stair, but took a detour and ran up the stairs on the other side. He ran to the canteen and was thinking about finding a place to hide when suddenly\u2014\u2014\"Squeak\"The door opened again.Jian Xingsui turned around and met An Ran who came in. The two of them looked at each other, and there was an awkward silence.An Ran smiled and pointed to the sign on his waist: \"Don't be nervous, I'm also from the blue team.\"Jian Xingsui still looked at him vigilantly, but An Ran comforted him and said, \"We are now teammates, Xing Sui, don't you believe me?\"Jian Xingsui stood on the spot: \"Are you going to hide here too?\"\"That's what I thought at the beginning.\" An Ran's appearance was quite handsome. When he spoke softly, he always gave people the feeling that he needed protection, and that he had no bad intentions. He said softly: \"But now I will have to find another place, it seems.\"They both had the cameras on their heads.Although the photographer didn't follow along, the entire gymnasium was equipped with surveillance video cameras, just to broadcast it to the audience. It was really embarrassing for An Ran to say such a thing. His reply almost meant that Jian Xingsui was forcing him to find another place.Jian Xingsui said, \"You can hide here if you want, I never said I wouldn't let you come.\"An Ran looked like he knew what he was thinking, and shook his head gently as if he was being driven away by Jian Xingsui: \"I'd better go, it won't be easy for you to hide when I will be here.\"Jian Xingsui didn't speak. Seeing that An Ran was about to leave, he also turned around to find a place to hide in the innermost part.Now they were in the same group, there was really no need to doubt the other too much. And now he didn't even have much time to care about these things. He couldn't rely on anyone, he could only rely on himself.An Ran was standing outside. He pulled the door of the cafeteria and was about to leave when as if remembering something, in the end, he did not close the door tightly but left a small gap, which may not be visible from the camera. (T/N: He did that to let the opposite team know that someone was inside.)1...Soon,The third group of people came in.Shen Xingchen led Ning Ze, Wen Shengge, and others to the second floor. He waved his hand like a bandit leader: \"Search, search for me!\"The main places to search were the library or practice room, and during this period, there were constantly broadcasts being made in the mechanical voice:\"Contestant No. 32 Hailu is eliminated, and the blue team has added one point.\"\"Contestant No. 5 Jiachi is eliminated, and the blue team has added one point.\"\"Contestant No. 6...\"After listening to it, Shen Xingchen cursed in a low voice: \"A bunch of trash, you have to rely on this Lord to fly, I don't believe that the blue team is so capable, don't let me find them, otherwise.......\"Wen Shengge came over and said, \"I didn't find anyone.\"A group of people just happened to pass by the cafeteria.Shen Xingchen wondered: \"Where did Jian Xingsui go?\"Wen Shengge: \"To hide away.\"\"This kid can really hide.\" Shen Xingchen snorted softly, but when he was about to pass by, he stopped: \"The cafeteria is open today? Why is this door open?\"Ning Ze said, \"Maybe someone is inside.\"When Shen Xingchen heard that, he was directly excited: \"Go in and have a look!\"The door was pushed open. Shen Xingchen walked swayingly and kicked the chair next to him. A loud noise rang out in the cafeteria. There were three or four people behind him.\u00a0A group of people searched very seriously, and when they were about to find Jian Xingsui's hiding place, under the eyes of everyone, a nimble figure slipped from the cabinet and ran straight to the back door.Wen Shengge said loudly, \"He is running!\"Shen Xingchen picked up his water gun: \"What are you running for!?\"Jian Xingsui thought to himself, what nonsense? If he won't run, then should he wait for himself to be besieged? Fortunately, the back door was connected to a remote stairway, and it was also very fast to run.The physical strength used in the dance practice was not a little bit, and then running for him was relatively easy. He took two or three steps in one breath.Shen Xingchen at the back shouted, \"Are you a horse, running this fast?\"Jian Xingsui quickly took lead from them by one floor. Just when he was about to breathe a sigh of relief, he saw another team of red team members at the corner. They were also surprised when they saw Jian Xingsui. It was Li Xu'an who shouted first: \"Catch him!\"1Jian Xingsui had to run away again.Because he was in a hurry, he could only keep going up. Once he stopped, he might be caught. Seeing that he was about to reach the rooftop, Jian Xingsui had no choice. Climbing up, he quickly grabbed the seal of the roof to seal the way.\"Hu......\"He was finally able to stop. Gasping for breath, he slumped to the ground, and raised his head, but met the eyes of the man who was standing on the roof leaning on the railing and smoking.Jian Xingsui's expression froze.Fu Jinxiao was leaning against the railing. The actor in casual clothes had his slender legs folded casually, a cigarette was sandwiched between his knuckled fingers, and smoke was slowly exhaling from his lips. He looked mature and attractive in a lazy and sexy way.Jian Xingsui's Adam's apple rolled.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows: \"You......\"Before Jian Xingsui could speak, suddenly there was a knocking sound from the seal he had used to seal the way. The angry fuckboy Shen Xingchen began to howl: \"Jian Xingsui, open the door. You are just hiding there without making a sound, I know you are inside. What are you doing in there? Are you raising any wild man? If you have the ability to meet wild men privately, you should have the ability to open the door!\"\"...\"Jian Xingsui's mouth twitched.Not far away, Fu Jinxiao heard these remarks and looked at the seal, squinting dangerously. The corner of his mouth slowly brought up a smile that made people feel terrified.Shen Xingchen obviously didn't know who the people inside were, nor did he know that his own tragic ending was inevitable. So he still had the nerves to shout.Seeing that the seal was about to loosen, Jian Xingsui hurriedly looked at Fu Jinxiao and said, \"Mr. Fu, let's run quickly!\"Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows: \"Run?\"Unlike them, a popular contestant like Shen Xingchen was accompanied by a cameraman. Jian Xingsui hurriedly said, \"They will come up in a while, it would be bad if you were photographed smoking, then some online media will definitely bring it to make a fuss, it's not very good for your reputation, let's run away before the seal is opened.\"Fu Jinxiao opened his lips, and just as he was about to speak, the seal showed signs of loosening.The actor originally wanted to express that he was not afraid of being photographed at all, but Jian Xingsui, who was eager to protect the master, had already rushed over. He panicked and held Fu Jinxiao's hand and ran: \"I remember that there seems to be an emergency exit on the rooftop. Let's run quickly, Xingchen still has a water gun in his hand!\"The seal rattled and couldn't hold it any longer, and finally, it was opened.Shen Xingchen was the first to climb up.\u00a0Because he had been chasing Jian Xingsui, Jian Xingsui, who should have been ignored, had always been on camera.\u00a0When Shen Xingchen stood on the rooftop and saw no one, he waved his hand: \"He must have run from the other door, hurry up!\"A group of people rushed towards the other corridor again.Jian Xingsui pulled Fu Jinxiao down from above, and before he could stand still, he saw a group of people running over the corridor.Shen Xingchen started to shoot with a water gun from a distance: \"I will see where will you still be able to run! How come you even found a helper ah? It's okay, I will take care of both of you!\"When water was being sprayed, Jian Xingsui hurriedly pulled Fu Jinxiao and ran. Fortunately, there was an open door at the corner, so he hurried in, turned, and closed the door. After a while, there were hurried footsteps outside. It seemed that Shen Xingchen and his party had left.Jian Xingsui finally let out a sigh of relief: \"Finally gone.\"A slow voice came from the side: \"Is it over?\"Jian Xingsui nodded while panting: \"It's over.\"\"Can you let go then?\" Fu Jinxiao's voice was a little teasing.Jian Xingsui's body stiffened and he lowered his head a little stiffly. He saw that he was holding onto the hand of Lord Shadow Emperor. He was too flustered just now and didn't pay attention. He let go of his hands in a flash, and quickly apologized: \"I'm sorry!\"Fu Jinxiao withdrew the somewhat red hand that was being grasped and said slowly: \"There's nothing to say sorry for, but next time you grasp it, you can be gentle. I won't leave. Why would you hold it so tightly?\"Next time......Jian Xingsui didn't know why, but he was so embarrassed and his heart was beating so fast that he didn't know what to say all of a sudden.Fu Jinxiao was quite at ease, he said, \"Why are you wet behind your back?\"\"Huh?\" Jian Xingsui only found out. He replied, \"It seems that I was drenched in water.\"Just as he was talking, the sound of Shen Xingchen's footsteps coming back and forth resounded outside.\u00a0While walking, the mumbler was very arrogant, and Jian Xingsui was obviously nervous again.Fu Jinxiao lifted his eyelids and looked out the door. His dark eyes narrowed slightly, revealing a dangerous emotion. He threw the cigarette in his hand, hooked his lips, and said to Jian Xingsui beside him, \"Do you want to fight back? ?\"Jian Xingsui was stunned: \"Huh?\"Fu Jinxiao: \"I am asking you something ne?\"\"I want.\" Jian Xingsui hesitated: \"But I, a mere human, can't handle so many of them by myself.\"Fu Jinxiao sneered: \"You don't count me as a human?\"It was only then that Jian Xingsui realized what he meant. He widened his eyes in surprise. He never imagined that one day he would actually be able to form a team with his mentor!But there was still a problem. Jian Xingsui was very worried: \"Brother Fu, there are double points for your brand name. If they go crazy for it, I'm afraid that the two of us won't be able to bear it. Moreover, they even have weapons...\"When he was thinking, Fu Jinxiao looked at him quietly.''They''When he heard Jian Xingsui say this, he thought, ''did he subconsciously think that he was with him?''Can someone give this guy extra points for forgetting his brand color?Fu Jinxiao looked at his eager and sincere appearance, and the corners of his lips slowly twitched into a smile. When Jian Xingsui was about to speak again, a pair of hands covered him, rubbed his head, and stopped what he was saying.\u00a0Fu Jinxiao was a head taller than him, and the man's comfort words went smoothly, and then he said: \"Do you think I will lose?\"Jian Xingsui's words came to an abrupt end.As soon as he looked up, he met the film emperor's handsome face. He had a shallow smile on his face. He looked so kind, but he was more like a dangerous hunter, showing a determined smile when his prey was about to be caught.\"Many times, it doesn't take a lot of people to win.\" Fu Jinxiao patted Jian Xingsui's little head: \"It depends on here.\"Turning around, this place was actually the prop room of the show team.But there was nothing important in this room. They were all stage props, skirts, fans, etc., basically useless, but Fu Jinxiao went to one of the walls, took off a mask from the wall and put it on. It was a white fox mask, which looked mysterious and handsome. He turned around and asked, \"How is it?\"Jian Xingsui nodded frantically: \"It looks good.\"Fu Jinxiao said to Jian Xingsui again, \"Do you have someone else's brand name in your hand?\"Jian Xingsui actually had one. He had torn off a person in a hurry when he was running, and he had held it in his pocket.Fu Jinxiao stretched out his hand: \"Bring it.\"Jian Xingsui obediently gave it to him.Fu Jinxiao took it and smiled: \"You just believed me so easily? What if I had taken it and ran away?\"Jian Xingsui was sure: \"You won't.\"......The room was silent for a moment.Fu Jinxiao took a deep look at Jian Xingsui and said nothing. He then lowered his body slightly and put someone else's nameplate on Jian Xingsui's body, and said, \"Now find a way to take me to your dormitory and find me a set of your training uniform.\"Jian Xingsui probably guessed what the film emperor was going to do. He said in surprise: \"You, you want to...\"\"Yeah.\" Fu Jinxiao turned the mask around in his hand. It was obviously just a mask, but he made it like a hunter wiping a shotgun before setting off. He looked at him sideways and hooked his lips.\u00a0At that moment, there seemed to be murderous intent hidden in those eyes that had always been lazy and smiling, and he said slowly, \"Let's go, I'll take care of them.\"It was unknown why, but when Jian Xingsui heard this sentence, he felt a chill on his back.And knowing that there were many people on the other side, at this moment, he actually wanted to give Shen Xingchen some RIP session for no reason.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Translator: Prakriti BhattaBruhh these chapters keep getting longer............................................Jian Xingsui never thought that one day he would make a team with Fu Jinxiao, and the two of them would go back to the dormitory together. It was like a dream.\"Brother, it seems that only Xingchen and Ning Ze are the same sizes as you are. They are both tall.\" Jian Xingsui sneaked back and was acting like a thief in his own dormitory. He said, \"Which one do you want?\"Fu Jinxiao didn't care: \"You can choose, it's fine.\"Jian Xingsui had no choice but to open the closet by himself.Because the film emperor also joined the action, there was a cameraman who followed for the filming.\u00a0Because most people strongly demanded to see the footage of Fu Jinxiao, the program team had no choice but to open a separate live broadcast room on the live broadcast platform for Fu Jinxiao and Jian Xingsui.\u00a0And it was precisely because of this that the number of viewers reached its peak.The number of online viewers in the main live broadcast room was 60 million. The number of viewers in contestants' sole live broadcast rooms had reached the highest number of online viewers for Shen Xingchen with 9 million, but when Fu Jinxiao's broadcast room opened, the number of online viewers reached 35 million in just five minutes. With the sharp climb, he was about to compete with the traffic of the entire show by himself.The audience was also very interested:\"Thank you Xing Sui for finding our brother Fu.\"\"Woooo, GKD, I haven't seen Brother Fu playing games for a long time.\"\"Are you going to change clothes, huhh brother Fu? Cute cameraman brother, please show .......hehe us more!\"Jian Xingsui found a set of clean clothes for Fu Jinxiao: \"Is this okay?\"Fu Jinxiao took it and looked at it casually: \"Okay.\"He took the clothes and checked them, but found that Jian Xingsui was still standing there dumbfounded, with a cute and naive appearance, so he curled his lips and smiled: \"Why, you want to watch me change clothes here?\"Jian Xingsui's body froze, shaking his head in panic under Fu Jinxiao's shifting gaze: \"No, no, I dare not!\"Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, which was very meaningful.The audience in the live room was already laughing like crazy:\"My dear, you dare not.\"\"Hahaha, it's not that he doesn't want to, it's just that he doesn't dare.\"\"I don't know why Brother Fu laughed, but I laughed too, and I actually realized it.\"\"So you are such a Jian Xingsui who wants to see but doesn't dare to.\"\"Understandable, after all, who wouldn't want to watch it, take me one.\"\"Pay attention, sisters, we might accidentally see something.\"However, the film emperor Fu, who had finished teasing the boy, went into the bathroom and quickly changed his clothes.\u00a0Because he was taller, even taller than Shen Xingchen, his trousers turned into nine-point trousers. He had to simply roll up the trousers and wear white sneakers, as well as the exclusive white sweatshirt of grade A looking young and handsome. He was obviously nearly thirty years old, but he did not look old at all but emitted a unique sense of maturity and handsomeness.Jian Xingsui stared blankly.In a trance, he stared at Fu Jinxiao who was wearing the training suit looking young, as if he was back many years ago. When he had just been chasing his idol, this person was standing on the TV, participating in a singing contest, and he was on the other side of the screen secretly cheering for him. Time flew and they actually were inside the same screen, and the distance between them was also so close.Fu Jinxiao tidied up his clothes, and said half-jokingly: \"If I go to participate in this show with this look, will I be able to make a debut?\"Jian Xingsui lowered his head hopelessly and his eyes turned slightly red. He took a deep breath, suppressed the heavy emotions in his heart, and smiled: \"You will definitely debut winning the center position.\"\"So sure?\"Fu Jinxiao was originally joking but at this moment, when casually walking out, he joked along the line: \"You will vote for me?\"Unexpectedly, a soft response came from behind: \"En, I will.\"...The joking words received a solemn response, and Fu Jinxiao's footsteps stopped.He turned around suddenly and met Jian Xingsui's eyes that didn't have time to recover.\u00a0Looking at each other, Fu Jinxiao's hand holding the doorknob was slightly tight. In the end, the man's usually deserted eyes became a little warmer, and he hooked his lips: \"Well, then thank you.\"Different from the previous jokes, this sentence was a little more serious.It was as if he was really thanking him.He was not looking at the screen with millions of fans, but looking at the person in front of him, thanking Jian Xingsui.Jian Xingsui felt it, and his eyes widened slightly in surprise. Fu Jinxiao's words were like gentle feathers gently falling on the tip of his heart.\u00a0He bowed his head unpromisingly. In fact, he had never asked for anything in return. He had seen unparalleled strength in his idol and learned the spirit of living a brave life from him. He was willing to support him silently all the time. No matter how much he invested his time in chasing his idol, he never thought of getting back anything.But suddenly, life played a joke on him. On his desperate and lowest days, this person appeared in front of him. He said thank you to himself, he was so gentle, like the sun shining in the sky, and suddenly it shone into such a dark corner of himself.Jian Xingsui's heart was boiling hot, he endured this complicated emotion again and again, and then restrained his red eyes.Fu Jinxiao looked down at him, his dark eyes getting deeper and deeper.After waiting for a while, there was another footstep outside, and finally, Fu Jinxiao calmed down. His eyes were much more serious, and he turned to Jian Xingsui and said, \"Act according to my plan for a while.\"Jian Xingsui also quickly retracted his mind and nodded: \"Okay!\"...The broadcast sound was still broadcasting continuously:\"Shen Ming, contestant No. 38, is eliminated, and the red team has added one point.\"\"Xu Guangzhen, contestant No. 90, is eliminated, and the blue team has added one point.\"As there were fewer and fewer people, those who survived became more vigilant. When two contestants passed by the stairwell, they saw a person wearing a mask who also went downstairs.\u00a0They were stunned for a moment, and they were the first to get ready to run, but when they found that the opponent was only one person, and he had a blue enemy card, they began to hesitate again.The white fox mask suddenly walked upstairs.As soon as he left, two people from the red team came up and shouted: \"Catch him!\"The white fox mask didn't go fast and was soon surrounded. The two red teams just wanted to come and tear his brand, but the white fox mask was very flexible. The two had to concentrate on entanglement with him. After the white fox's sign was taken down, the people from the red team smiled proudly: \"Let's see where you kid will be able to go now.\"Just when the two of them relaxed their vigilance, suddenly\u2014\u2014\"Pa\"\"Pa\"The two signs were torn down, and in an instant, the sound of the broadcast sounded in the hall: \"No. 7 Xu Wei is eliminated, the blue team has added one point.\"\"No. 66 Zhang Zuoyou is eliminated, the blue team has added one point.\"This broadcasting sound confused both of them. Just when the smile of victory was still on their faces, they had to look behind them in disbelief. Jian Xingsui held their brand names embarrassedly. He smiled at the two of them: \"I'm sorry you two.\"The two people of the red team shivered and pointed to the white fox: \"Why did we tear up his brand name, but he didn't get eliminated?\"\"Oh, about that.\" Jian Xingsui took it and said, \"This is not his brand name.\"This was the brand name of the contestant who he had torn the last time. So of course there will be no broadcast if it is torn down again.The number of comments in the live broadcast room had increased sharply:\"Wonderful.\"\"Hahahaha, Brother Fu, you indeed are an old FOX.\"\"Why is this man still so cunning www\"\"Rule no.2333, don't be an enemy of Fu Jinxiao.\"After listening to this, the two of the red team members widened their eyes. Without caring about anything, they shouted angrily: \"Insidious, too insidious, you guys! Who thought of such a sinister idea?\"Jian Xingsui had no choice but to giggle cheerfully but dare not make a sound.The two members of the red team were finally taken away, and they met other teammates on the way. Because the program group stipulated that they could not directly mention the names of the contestants who had eliminated them, they could only say to the other teammates who had not yet been eliminated, be careful with the masked people and help them to get their revenge.Soon, the rumors of the masked man spread among the red team.Jian Xingsui, who was walking in the corridor there, also knew the current situation, so he cautiously said to Fu Jinxiao, \"Brother, are we getting too much hatred? It's too dangerous.\"\"Huh?\" Fu Jinxiao looked down at him after hearing the words: \"So if we don't do this, then will the danger be reduced and no one will chase you anymore?\"Jian Xingsui was stunned and speechless.Fu Jinxiao hooked his lips and smiled, perhaps because he was in a good mood, or perhaps for other reasons, he opened his mouth and educated a few more words:\u00a0\"Remember, concessions and forbearance can't protect you. The enemy won't let you go because you are weak, but will see you as easy to bully and intensify the bullying.\"Just like in the beginning, when he was hiding in the kitchen, he didn't get away with it, but he was also chased very embarrassedly.Jian Xingsui was thoughtful. He realized something, and murmured, \"It seems to be like that.\"Fu Jinxiao also observed the surroundings vigilantly while walking, and said slowly: \"Besides, nowadays, it is not necessarily decided who is afraid of meeting who.\"Such confident words came out of his mouth and it even seemed so normal.Bruhh, his idol turned out to be an arrogant winner of life!...At the same time, another part of the stairway.Wen Shengge also moved to Shen Xingchen's side: \"Brother Chen, I heard that the blue team has a very good masked man. They have already tore up several of us.\"Shen Xingchen walked swaggeringly and glared at him: \"You're afraid of shit!\"\"No matter who he is, I will teach him how to tear a brand name!\" The most important thing Shen Xingchen never lacked in his life was self-confidence, so he almost walked away with the ''self-confidence halo'': \"Today I want to see how capable that masked man is.\"As he was talking, at the next corner, a figure suddenly appeared in the stairway. The man was wearing a white fox mask, and he also saw Shen Xingchen and a group of people.Shen Xingchen paused, made sure of it, and said loudly, \"Stop for me!\"Then he rushed over.Wen Shengge, who was behind, was stunned for a moment, and then ran forward.When Shen Xingchen ran to the white fox mask, he took a water gun and slid a few times, but the white fox's movements were really very flexible. He avoided every attack with a few dodges, and his reaction ability was much stronger than many contestants. Shen Xingchen already had some bad premonitions.thenThe white fox dodged and entered a room. It was about to disappear. Shen Xingchen couldn't think of that much anymore. He was afraid that the fish in his hand would run away, so he hurriedly followed.\u00a0As soon as he entered the room, he saw the white fox mask turn around. It was almost an instant. Before he could see it clearly, he was grabbed and pressed onto the soft cushion of the fitness room.Shen Xingchen cried out in pain.At the same time, with a crisp tearing sound, the brand name was torn off.For many contestants, Shen Xingchen, who was difficult to deal with, was handled like a lamb to be slaughtered under Fu Jinxiao's hands. Even the young master himself couldn't believe it, and he said, \"Who are you? If you have the ability to take off my brand, you must have the ability to take off the mask, you dare to hide from me, believe it or not, today...\"Fu Jinxiao stopped, opened his lips and asked him, \"What will you do today?\"As soon as these words came out, Shen Xingchen's words suddenly stopped abruptly.Fu Jinxiao let go of the person, took off the mask slowly, raised his eyelids and looked at the arrogant boy with leisure: \"Speak, are you dumb?\"Shen Xingchen saw that it was the Lord of Hell, the expression on his face could be said to be blue and white, and finally he said, \"Brother, you are ruthless.\"Fu Jinxiao let him go, and then very quickly, Shen Xingchen turned his face and realized that there was someone next to him, holding his brand name in his hand. He almost shouted it in one breath: \"Jian Xingsui!\"Jian Xingsui was feeling inexplicably guilty beside him, so he could only smile awkwardly: \"Brother Chen.\"\"You! You black-hearted wolf, you tore up my brand name?\" Shen Xingchen gave me an expression of being betrayed, and he shouted, \"How dare you do this to me, you traitor!\"\"...\"That's not how you shouted when you were chasing me around.As a group of people were talking, Wen Shengge and Ning Ze also ran over not far away, but they were not prepared. As soon as they came in, they were torn apart by Jian Xingsui who just stood at the door before they could react.Wen Shengge was very calm. He was tired of running with Shen Xingchen for a long time. He was a little relieved that it was none other than his roommate Jian Xingsui. He patted Jian Xingsui on the shoulder and said, \"Remember to treat us to the hot pot together.\"Jian Xingsui nodded: \"Sure.\"Shen Xingchen was actually shouting, but he was relieved to see that Jian Xingsui was fine. Just as he was about to get up and leave, another group of people's footsteps was heard from outside the room not far away, accompanied by shallow chatting voices: \"Is it this way?\"The people in the room kept silent, waiting for the people outside to come in.Li Xu'an and a group of people from the red team rushed in. The nearest Jian Xingsui was in the most dangerous place.\u00a0He was about to be caught in front of everyone, but before he could do anything, Shen Xingchen picked up the gun and squeaked: \"Hahahaha, suffer to death, you guys!\"Li Xu'an only heard that the masked man was here, but he didn't expect that the crazy arrogant bastard Shen Xingchen was also here.\"Fuck!\" Li Xu'an got wet from the spray, and he jumped: \"Shen Xingchen, what's wrong with you, we are in the same group, okay?\"Shen Xingchen threw the gun away, came over and held Li Xu'an and said, \"Who cares if we are in the same group, you dare to eliminate my little brother?? What a beautiful thought! Hurry up, hurry up and tear him apart.\"Jian Xing squatted down and tore off Li Xu'an.Li Xu'an shouted: \"I will report you Shen Xingchen!! You dsjdfhdhus You betrayed your buddies from the same group!\"\"OHOHOHO, How come it happened ne? I'm sorry.\" Shen Xingchen seemed so proud: \"I've been eliminated, I'm not from your group anymore, hahaha.\"Li Xu'an: \"...\"He was speechless on the spot.The audience in the live broadcast room also died of laughter:\"He's still proud\"\"A little touched, Xingchen blames the traitor on the surface, and still protects his younger brother when he is in danger.\"\"He always said that he would tear up Jian Xingsui's brand name, but he didn't tear it up even after getting the chance several times.\"\"The best Shen Xingchen in the world.\"If Li Xu'an hadn't had a cameraman shooting there, he would have almost vomited on Shen Xingchen's asshole face. When he saw Fu Jinxiao standing next to him out of the corner of his eyes, he choked up again.Why were there so many crouching dragons and phoenixes in this small room?He just met Ms. Tuya, and Ms. Tuya told him that Brother Fu was assigned by the program team to be from the red team, so why was he standing there and looking like he didn't belong to the red team at all? !...Soon, the program team ordered the eliminated contestants to quickly leave the venue.Jian Xingsui said to Shen Xingchen, \"Let's go first, it should be over soon. Let's eat the hot pot rewarded at night.\"Shen Xingchen threatened him: \"I have to eat something I like.\"Jian Xingsui was helpless: \"Yes, yes.\"\"Hmph, I still like hotpot, little traitor.\"Jian Xingsui said, \"You call me a little traitor then why did you still help me to suppress Li Xu'an?\"Shen Xingchen was stunned.In fact, he really hadn't reacted very much at that time.\u00a0Just seeing that Jian Xingsui was in danger, he subconsciously rushed. Although he knew that he was not in the same group, subconsciously, he felt that he and Jian Xingsui had always been together. This was his younger brother, no matter what group they were from. (T/N: It's brother's instinct, bro)\"Hmph.\" The grandfather snorted softly: \"It was simply because I don't like that kid Li Xu'an.\" He was never afraid of the camera.Audiences were also used to it:\"Hahaha, this is the 10086th person he dislikes.\"\"I love you so much\"\"Although I'm a fan of Xu An, I still want to laugh.\"After this group of people was eliminated, the number of people who remained in the program group gradually decreased.Jian Xingsui turned to look at Fu Jinxiao and looked at the brand names in his own hand, and said with emotion, \"Like a big landlord, I never thought I would be so much rich one day.\"Fu Jinxiao chuckled lightly: \"En.\"The two walked outside. After the battle just now, Jian Xingsui had completely trusted Fu Jinxiao, but there was a question he couldn't understand: \"Brother, you could have torn their brand names by yourself, so why did you tell me to do that?\"Fu Jinxiao said \"Huh?\" and said lightly: \"Don't you want to eat hot pot, the more you tear, the more hotpot you will get to eat.\"Jian Xingsui was stunned.Looking at Fu Jinxiao at a loss, his heart felt like a warm water was flowing all of a sudden. He didn't even know how to organize his language: \"Then, what about you?\"Fu Jinxiao hooked his lips: \"It's the same whether I get it or not.\"Having said that, Jian Xingsui was still very moved.He knew that if Fu Jinxiao wanted, he could just have not participated in this game originally. Maybe he just wanted to play to have some fun, but it had nothing to do with him.\u00a0Maybe it was for some other reason, but no matter what, it was Fu Jinxiao who helped him. Because of him, he was able to stand here, instead of being chased by others in embarrassment.The man walked in front of him, his slender and tall body was like a solid harbor, which seemed very reassuring, as if there would be no danger if he was there....For a moment, Jian Xingsui even wanted time to stop at this moment.There are very few happy moments in his life, and once he tastes a little sweetness, he is afraid that this is the last time.Just thinking about it, suddenly, a voice came from behind: \"Xing Sui?\"Jian Xingsui's body froze, he stopped and turned around in disbelief, and faced An Ran's face. His appearance was like a basin of cold water poured from the beginning to the end, and the bubbles that made his original happiness and fantasy were shattered.An Ran smiled slightly and said, \"What a coincidence!\"Fu Jinxiao was not wearing a mask. He leaned against the wall, raised his eyelids lazily and glanced at him, but did not speak.Jian Xingsui knew that they were in the same group, and said, \"It's a coincidence, why are you here.\"\"I was hiding by myself, and then I got separated from my teammates.\"\u00a0An Ran stuck out his tongue in annoyance. He looked very cute. His big watery eyes fell on Fu Jinxiao, as if he had just seen the film emperor, and bowed excitedly: \"Hello, Brother Fu.\"Fu Jinxiao hummed lightly.An Ran looked at the two calmly, guessing that it was probably a team relationship.He was a very smart person. He knew how many viewers he could get by simply forming a team with the film emperor Fu.\u00a0No matter whether he wins or loses, he can earn a lot of shots in front of the audience. It was a win-win situation. If he performed well, he might even be able to get a wave of goodwill in front of the actor.Thinking of this, An Ran smiled and said, \"It's a coincidence that we are all from the blue team, so can I join you?\"Jian Xingsui was obviously taken aback when he heard the words.He wasn't willing. He didn't want to. He finally got to spend a short time with Fu Jinxiao. This might also be one of the few opportunities. There may not be a few times like this in the future in his life. It turns out that happiness was really short-lived.An Ran said with embarrassment: \"Because I am alone now, there seem to be a lot of people from the red team around here.\u00a0It should be safer and better if we have more people in our team, and I have also exchanged a lot of materials! \"Jian Xingsui was feeling very bitter and didn't care about it at all.However, an elegant and calm male voice sounded from behind: \"Okay.\"It was Fu Jinxiao's voice.Jian Xingsui's body froze, and his heart slowly sank.An Ran smiled, and before he could speak, Fu Jinxiao stepped forward, but put the mask in An Ran's hand: \"Since you want to join us, put on this mask.\"An Ran was taken aback: \"This is?\"The film emperor's handsome face had his usual light smile. At this moment, the amorous phoenix's eyes were squinting, but he was like a dangerous old fox, and his voice was warm: \"This is the symbol of our team, everyone who joins the team must wear it, which means they officially join us.\"An Ran suddenly realized: \"Is that so?\"Jian Xingsui looked at Fu Jinxiao's serious nonsense in shock.Fu Jinxiao nodded lightly: \"Of course.\"The audience in the live room was already laughing crazy:\"Hahahahaha, what a trick to bring disaster to this An Ran.\"\"An Ran, you still have time to run.\"\"Rule no.2336, never expect Brother Fu to be a normal person.\"\"Nice job.\".............................Thank you guys for reading. Please feel free to comment your thoughts.(T/N: I am liking how the film emperor is pitting that An Stupid Ran)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, the viewers weren\u2019t fools \u2013 despite the contestants acting all buddy-buddy with each other, they were all still competing by the end of the day.But if this matter was done by Fu Jinxiao, they would only laugh it off. According to logic, it was Anran1\u00a0who took the initiative in joining Fu Jinxiao\u2019s team. So it was his fault if he was duped in the end. Besides, the viewers already knew Actor Fu\u2019s temperament for many years now \u2013 they were used to this. He\u2019s the black-bellied type, so of course he would do something like this.Anran, who still didn\u2019t know much about the actual situation, took the mask and asked hesitantly, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you two wear it?\u201d\u201cUs? Well, this might be the logo of our team, but since you are the rookie amongst us three, it will naturally be passed for you to wear,\u201d Fu Jinxiao lied through his teeth.At first glance, there seemed to be nothing wrong with his words.But Anran\u2019s gut feelings told him otherwise.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s smile faded. He was very accurate in grasping people\u2019s hearts, so he spoke as if he wanted to take his offer back, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, forget it.\u201dSeeing that the mask was about to be taken back, Anran snatched it back immediately, and quickly put it on like a treasure. He slapped his own face, and then he quickly explained himself, as he was afraid that Fu Jinxiao might misunderstand, \u201cNo no no, I want to join you!\u201dFu Jinxiao smiled.The audience in the live broadcast room laughed like crazy.[You are still too naive, my child.][It\u2019s wrong to add insult to injury, but I can\u2019t help but want to laugh.][Fu-ge, you truly are a ruthless man.]Jian Xingsui was still in shock, and his dazed little expression became one of the jokes. The audience quickly christened his expression into a reaction meme.Before this, everyone had given him the nickname of \u201c20,000 yuan Brother\u201d. Their impression of him was that he was a very naive boy. After this battle royale, many viewers found that most of the contestants are actually smarter than they usually appear. In contrast, this simple kid suddenly looked very attractive, especially when he was following behind the shrewd Actor Fu. It was as if the big-tailed wolf suddenly gained a little white rabbit as a loyal follower. The contrast between the two was very appealing.Fu Jinxiao turned around and patted Jian Xingsui, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dJian Xingsui nodded quickly, \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter this rag-tag team walked forward a bit, they heard a distant voice from the radio upstairs: \u201cThere are 10 minutes left until the end of the game. The remaining players are 30 in total, 19 on the red side and 11 on the blue side. The current score of the red camp is 43 points, the blue camp\u2019s score is 54 points. We are about to close the passages on the third, fourth and fifth floors. We kindly ask for all players to please move to the first floor\u2019s lobby as soon as possible.\u201dIt was almost like shrinking the poison circle2.It is impossible for the contestants to hide. It forced those who hid in the dark to come out. The dawn of the final battle came closer and closer.Anran asked, \u201cWhy do we only have so few people left?\u201dJian Xingsui looked around and said, \u201cThe red camp\u2019s firepower is quite fierce.\u201d\u201cBut our score is quite high, who has all those torn off name tags then?\u201d Anran pretended to ask casually, but he actually kept looking at the two people beside him.Jian Xingsui hesitated for a moment, considering whether to answer or not.Fu Jinxiao, however, glanced at Anran lightly, and said in a slow tone, \u201cIt\u2019s not with you anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was the truth, but it felt slanderous somehow.Anran\u2019s parlor was now gloomier, but he didn\u2019t dare to talk back to Fu Jinxiao. Of course he also guessed that this should be a sensitive issue, so he simply stopped asking.He came here for a team-up because he wanted to get screen time together with Fu Jinxiao. What he didn\u2019t expect, however, was that instead of having a wonderful start, he got the beginning of a nightmare instead.All three of them went down to the second floor, but they bumped into people from the enemy \u2013 the red camp.The members of the red camp were taken aback for a moment, and the person leading the team was Zhou Xun. He was holding a water gun. When he saw the three blue camp members approaching from the opposite side of the room, he immediately picked up the gun vigilantly and made a defensive posture.The person behind him said, \u201cIt\u2019s the masked man! Zhou-ge, it\u2019s him!\u201dZhou Xun also noticed it, and he said angrily, \u201cWe finally found him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him who eliminated many people from our camp.\u201d The younger man behind him said, \u201cZhou-ge, the points on the blue camp\u2019s side are so high, and most of them are held by the masked man, it seemed to be attached to his cell phone. Should we\u2026\u201dZhou Xun spat, \u201cOf course I know! But you didn\u2019t see the masked man\u2019s phone. And that\u2019s Fu-ge\u00a0beside him!\u201dNo one dared to tear Fu Jinxiao\u2019s name tag. So having him was enough of a deterrent \u2013 by just standing there menacingly, he could emit a pressure that scared people.The younger man encouraged him and said: \u201cThen we don\u2019t tear Fu-ge\u2019s name tag, we just need to deal with the masked man. We couldn\u2019t let that masked man escape!\u201dZhou Xun thought so too, so he nodded. This time, he was unlucky to not be in the same team as Anran. As they were technically enemies in this game, Zhou Xun was always worried he would meet his sweetheart and had no choice but to fight him. But if he didn\u2019t perform well because he was soft to Anran, he would lose his face.But it seemed that his luck was coming around. He met the infamous masked man here. So long he succeeded in taking off the masked man\u2019s name tag, won\u2019t all of his problems be solved in one fell swoop?The only caveat was that Fu-ge\u00a0is here, and it\u2019s a 2v3 in his team\u2019s disadvantage.\u201cHey, you are here too.\u201d Just as he was thinking, a voice came from the nearby upstairs, \u201cI am also from the red camp, what a coincidence.\u201dHis back-up was here!Zhou Xun suddenly breathed a sigh of relief, pointed to the person in front and said, \u201cOver there! The masked man is over there!\u201dWithout too many words, the red camp back-up members had serious expressions when they heard the word \u2018masked man\u2019, \u201cWhere is he?\u201dThe masked man was notoriously good. More or less, someone\u2019s friend or teammate has been eliminated by him. Now they have a number advantage over him. Such a big piece of fatty meat, who wouldn\u2019t want to grab his points for themselves?The two sides looked at each other, and both saw calculations in each other\u2019s eyes.Zhou Xun was afraid that the other party would strike first, so he didn\u2019t have time to think carefully. He gave an order to the teammates behind him, \u201cDon\u2019t let them run away, hurry up!\u201dWith that command, everyone rushed forward \u2013 nobody would want to come out as the loser.At the other end of the corridor, Anran stared dumbfounded at the rushing red camp, weak and helpless.Fu Jinxiao , who was in front of him, had already prepared. He turned around and gave a command to the two people behind him: \u201cRun.\u201dThis time, Zhou Xun was going to go all out. The goal was very clear, which was to defeat the masked man. Anran also wanted to run along with him. Unexpectedly, Zhou Xun rushed over like crazy, holding a water gun and spraying at the three of his enemies. He tried to aim at the biggest piece of meat, and ignored the other two.Anran still tried to resist: \u201cYou\u2026\u201dZhou Xun said harshly, \u201cI see where you are going this time!\u201dThe overwhelming water poured down, and there was no way to retreat. Before Anran could open the door of the cafeteria, he wanted Shen Xingchen, who was also holding a water gun, to make trouble for Jian Xingsui.But alas, he never expected that the person who would finally enjoy this kind of treatment was actually himself. And on top of that, he was shot by his good friend.Anran: \u201c\u2026\u201dAs the red camp members rushed up and tore off his name tag, Zhou Xun was stunned after he took a good look at the masked man\u2019s identity. He raised his head hesitantly, his voice wavering, \u201cRanran?\u201dIt was actually Anran who was splashed wet like a drowned rat. Miserably, he took off the mask, wanting to cry but no tears came. How could he still have the beauty of a fairy boy now? His hair was messed up, and his makeup was smudged. He looked uglier than usual \u2013 just like another nameless character nobody would care about.In contrast to Anran\u2019s misery, the audience in the live broadcast room was very happy with the current turn of events.[This is too tragic.][It\u2019s really difficult for our Angelic Ranran\u2026][Is it just me or now I think he\u2019s not particularly good-looking\u2026?][Think carefully about the many things that happened this time. After the contestant was drenched in water, he would lose his hairstyle. And that\u2019s an easy point to dock from their current good-looks. Though, there\u2019s an exception to this rule\u2026]Of course, the audience was talking about Jian Xingsui.Because of the strong contrast of Anran\u2019s appearance, many viewers suddenly became inspired. They put a college of comparison between the before and after a contestant was drenched. Not-so-surprisingly, they found out that the person with the most consistent good-look was their 20,000 yuan Brother.That\u2019s right, it\u2019s him, who was currently sporting a buzz-cut hairstyle. No matter if he\u2019s wet or not, his hair wouldn\u2019t change.That\u2019s right, it\u2019s him, who casually wiped off his drenched face, not caring if he would smudge his make-up. Because he\u2019s not wearing any, he has no such worry.Combining those two facts made this young man stand out from the crowd.The audience also sighed with emotion:[Sure enough, the buzz-cut hairstyle is the true test of appearance. Idols nowadays are hard-carried by their trendy hairstyles.][Actually, if you look closely, I think he is very good-looking.][At first I didn\u2019t think he was very handsome, but now I think he\u2019s very attractive now.][His facial features are very three-dimensional. This is the kind that a cute girl would fight wars over~]Anran never thought that when he came here to get extra screen time, he would instead become a foil to Jian Xingsui because of their differences in hairstyle and make-up. Not only did he end up making a wedding dress3\u00a0for Jian Xingsui by mistake; nobody felt sorry for him, and he can\u2019t even sell his misery for the audience\u2019s pity points!On the other side, Jian Xingsui, who ran out of the crowd all the way to the hall, felt his legs go limp. He had never been so excited in his life.Fu Jinxiao, who was beside him, glanced sideways at him, \u201cIs this not enough?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Jian Xingsui looked up, and found that the movie emperor4\u00a0next to him had obviously run the same distance, but he was neither flushing red nor panting. Curiosity took over, so he asked, \u201cGe, are you so physically strong?\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows when he heard the words, and commented mercilessly: \u201cIt\u2019s because you lack exercise.\u201dJian Xingsui murmured softly: \u201cI have been exercising for a while. But I still feel dizzy\u2026\u201d\u201cExercising requires long-term persistence,\u201d Fu Jinxiao guided the child\u2019s wrong thoughts, but he spoke not in a criticizing tone, rather it was in an impartial one, \u201cI have strengthened my physical fitness for a long time. Coupled that with my work in many films, it was no wonder I would be stronger than you. A good physical condition is also a kind of professionalism in my line of work.\u201dJian Xingsui inwardly complained in his thoughts,\u00a0\u2018Just what level do you consider hard-working? You injured your throat because you sang too much, you skipped many meals until your stomach needed extra care, and you have a lot of old injuries because of filming accidents. Don\u2019t you feel a little bit of shame telling your junior to take care of his body?\u2019He secretly slandered the older man from the bottom of his heart, so his facial expression was a little out of control. Fu Jinxiao squinted his eyes and easily noticed this, so he used this opportunity to tease the youth, \u201cAre you secretly saying bad things about me in your heart?\u201dJian Xingsui was shocked!He looked at Fu Jinxiao in disbelief. Does this man have mind reading skills?Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, and his tone became a little threatening: \u201cHey, I was really right, then?\u201dJian Xingsui wanted to quibble, but looking at Fu Jinxiao\u2019s dark eyes, he suddenly remembered that the actor said he hated liars the most. So he obediently begged for mercy: \u201cI was wrong, I don\u2019t dare to do it again, I will definitely exercise hard.\u201d\u2018His little cowardly appearance was actually cute,\u2019\u00a0Fu Jinxiao mused.Fu Jinxiao couldn\u2019t hold back his muffled laughter. It was the kind of joy that resonated in his chest, different from the public relations-style polite laugh he usually used. He was really amused by the youth in front of him.The audience in the live broadcast room also laughed:[These two people are inexplicably so cute.][I don\u2019t know why but I feel they\u2019re quite sweet lol.][I didn\u2019t have this feeling when I saw his CP with Anran. The corners of my mouth couldn\u2019t stop rising up when I saw them talking to each other.][Fu-ge\u00a0really likes to bully people~]As the audience was discussing things, the radio suddenly broadcast an announcement:\u201cThe time is up, this game is officially over. The red camp\u2019s final score is 51 points, and the blue camp\u2019s final score is 57 points. The winner is blue camp! The staff will calculate the winner\u2019s name tags, so please gather in the square.\u201dThe broadcast ended, heralding the noisy burst of cheers from the blue camp\u2019s members. They won from a headwind position! Their joy was making them a little bit too wild.Jian Xingsui was also very happy when he heard the broadcast. He raised his head and smiled at Fu Jinxiao with sparkling eyes: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to win.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Fu Jinxiao nodded, tore off his name tag, and said in a low voice: \u201cWe won.\u201dJian Xingsui paused.He mused about what Fu Jinxiao meant by \u201cwe\u201d.It turned out that one day, and there was such a lucky day. He was considered in Fu Jinxiao\u2019s definition of \u201cus\u201d. Not \u201chim\u201d nor \u201cyou\u201d. \u201cUs\u201d together.This might just be a casual sentence from the actor, but Jian Xingsui\u2019s ears are extremely hot. He was like a sponge that has dried up for a long time, carefully absorbing all the available invisible warmth, carefully cherishing every scrap he could find.Fu Jinxiao handed him the name tag and said, \u201cWhy are you so dazed, go and hand in the name tag to the staff.\u201dJian Xingsui quickly took it over and replied, \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter reacting, he realized that these were two name tags. After hesitating for a while, he said, \u201cGe, I\u2019ll just hand in this one. Or, do you want me to hand in your name tag too?\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded, \u201cIt can also be counted as points.\u201dThe words \u201cFu Jinxiao\u201d were written in black, regular script. It looked plain, if not for the words printed on it. Jian Xingsui squeezed it a little bit harder in his hand, and hesitated for a moment.Fu Jinxiao urged: \u201cHurry up, if you hand it a little later, you won\u2019t get into any screen time.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dHe ran to the scoring staff with small steps and handed over the name tag. The staff took a look and said: \u201cThis is no good, Fu-ge\u2018s name tag was not torn by you, so it cannot be counted as your score.\u201dJian Xingsui was not sad: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dJust as the staff threw the sign into the box aside, Jian Xingsui suddenly said: \u201cHey, since there is no scoring, can you give me this name tag?\u201dThe staff looked at him in surprise.\u201cI mean\u2026\u201d Jian Xingsui was also a little embarrassed at his sudden query: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t count anyway, right?\u201dAlthough the staff felt a little strange in their hearts, in the end, it really didn\u2019t matter. So they nodded in agreement, \u201cOkay, you can take it.\u201dJian Xingsui hurriedly took Fu Jinxiao\u2019s name tag from the box. It seemed that the name tag still had some warmth, and he put it in his pocket like a treasure.Everything he experienced recently was as happy as a dream. He was very afraid that if one day he woke up from this pleasant dream, he wouldn\u2019t know what to do. After tasting a bit of sweetness, he no longer could live in bitterness.But\u2026 every good thing has an expiration date. He could be so lucky in his life.In the end, he thought that this was enough. Even if he was to be eliminated from the show, with this memento, he could recall those sweet memories to give him extra strength to continue forward.1the previous translator used \u201cAn Ran\u201d.

Hurry up!\u201dJian Xingsui hurried his steps. At first, he walked quickly, but when he got closer, he changed to a small step for some reason, and finally rushed to his roommates\u2019 side.\u201cWhy are you moving so slowly?\u201d Shen Xingchen muttered, \u201cYou aren\u2019t happy to see us? Don\u2019t want to come back?\u201dJian Xingsui shook his head lightly: \u201cNo. Not that.\u201dShen Xingchen snorted softly: \u201cThat\u2019s about the same!\u201dWen Shengge next to him also smiled and said, \u201cWe are lucky tonight. You must be the number one, so you\u2019ll get a hot pot for dinner! Since we are in the same room as Suisui, we can have a taste, can\u2019t we? So happy~\u201dNing Ze also nodded: \u201cWe are blessed.\u201dJian Xingsui listened to their cheerful words. His heart felt really warm. He lowered his head, and said in a low voice: \u201cIt is also my blessing to know all of you.\u201dThe surrounding voices were too noisy for everyone to hear clearly.But Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t care, because he already understood that the really important feelings don\u2019t need to be emphasized loudly, as long as they are well treasured in his heart.This was enough.For the dinner celebration, the program group suddenly grew a conscience, and they arranged a big buffet in the cafeteria for everyone to enjoy.Because the blue camp was the winner, they were especially rewarded. They got extra rich self-service hot pot ingredients. Seeing this, the red camp\u2019s members became very envious.As one of the leaders of the red team, Shen Xingchen had penetrated into the enemy\u2019s inner rank. He casually sat next to Jian Xingsui and began to eat unceremoniously. Seeing their leader\u2019s shameless behavior, other members of the red camp soon followed suit. At the beginning, the members of the blue team would pretend to fight and not let them eat, but later they really couldn\u2019t care much, and instead enjoy the jolly atmosphere of everyone happily eating the delicious, steaming hot pot.The previous grievances between the two camps also dissipated.Boys were sometimes good at this \u2013 there was no such thing as an overnight feud when food was involved.However, when eating, most of the people\u2019s thoughts were still preoccupied with the mysterious envelope. Naturally, a large number of people gathered to discuss who would be eliminated.\u201cWhen will the envelope be opened?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m too worried to eat\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really curious.\u201dHowever, there were some people who really just focused on eating, and didn\u2019t give a single thought about the envelope.Shen Xingchen saw that Wen Shengge and Ning Ze looked a little too serious. As the (self-proclaimed) leader of their room, he spoke to them, \u201cDo you know why the show crew arranged this dinner before the ranking announcement? They just wanted everyone to be together, to enjoy the dinner without so much sadness about some of the contestant\u2019s parting or something. So, let\u2019s have a happy dinner together, yeah? You think too much, let us not waste any good intentions of the show\u2019s crew.\u201dSometimes this fool\u2019s babble actually hit the mark.After thinking about it, Wen Shengge and Ning Ze agreed. So they pushed aside their worries and tried to enjoy the dinner as-is. Besides, the food was actually delicious, they could very well indulge in it for a moment.Just at this time, the cafeteria\u2019s door was pushed open. It was the instructors who came in. Seeing that the instructors were here, someone hurriedly greeted in excitement, \u201cTeacher, come and let\u2019s have dinner together!\u201dTeacher Tuya was an easy-going lady. She had always been very popular among the trainees. She greeted them back warmly, her expression was open and welcoming, \u201cWow, this smells so good~\u201d\u201cTeachers, have you eaten yet?\u201d\u201cTeacher, come here to eat.\u201dThe trainees were very enthusiastic, greeting the instructors one after another.Fu Jinxiao came down after changing his clothes. He wore a loose and casual sportswear. Except for the tailored suit he wore when he first appeared on the stage, he always wore such loose clothing in order not to steal the trainee\u2019s limelight. Actor Fu tried to tone down his attractiveness with plain, ill-fitting clothes. But he was good-looking with a nice physique, so even in such clothing, he was already quite attention-grabbing.Amidst the trainees\u2019 lively greeting, Jian Xingsui was a bit silent. He was hesitant to greet Fu Jinxiao at first. But then, from the corner of his eyes, he saw Anran move an empty chair to his side, clearly wanting to ask the actor to sit next to him. It seemed that Anran was about to greet Fu Jinxiao, and that was enough to vaporize his previous hesitation.He suddenly remembered Fu Jinxiao\u2019s own words \u2013 that blind patience and cowardice will never make the enemy back down.A little glimmer of courage grew from the bottom of his heart.Many people greeted Fu Jinxiao. Anran also raised his hand: \u201cFu-ge\u2026\u201dHowever, he was blocked by a crisp voice that came from the opposite side. Jian Xingsui bravely called out: \u201cFu-ge, there is a space here.\u201dActually, the voice wasn\u2019t loud. Compared to other trainee\u2019s greetings, it could be considered a quiet voice. But to Fu Jinxiao, the voice was clear as day. The actor was still smiling and refusing to greet other students, so turned his face to Jian Xingsui. He sat down beside the youth without any hesitation.Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t expect to succeed, he looked at the man beside him with a foolish, dumbfounded look.Fu Jinxiao should have washed up. He could pick up a faint fragrance on the actor\u2019s body. He couldn\u2019t actually tell what kind of scent it was, but it smells better than any other perfume he knew. It smells perfectly fitting to Fu Jinxiao \u2013 attractive and distinctly mature.Fu Jinxiao glanced at him with the corner of his eyes, and teased the youth softly: \u201cYou still have the conscience to greet me politely. It seems like my grace hasn\u2019t been forgotten.\u201dJian Xingsui came back to his senses, and quickly said, \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten!\u201dIn order to express that he really didn\u2019t forget, Jian Xingsui also praised the actor rather excessively. He thanked the actor in a low voice, \u201cIt is thanks to you that I can eat this meal today.\u201d\u201cWhat are you being too modest for? You were quite brave when tearing off other contestants\u2019 name tags, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Fu Jinxiao continued his teasing, \u201cWe are comrades-in-arms, Comrade Little Jian.\u201dThis nickname was chosen casually to tease the youth, but it somehow sounded very intimate.Jian Xingsui listened to it and felt his ears burn. In order to cover up his excitement, he also helped the film emperor adjust his dipping sauce. He was very good at mixing an appetizing sauce.Shen Xingchen tasted his own dipping sauce that Jian Xingsui mixed, and he claimed it was tasty. Thanks to the young master\u2019s commotion, many people from other tables came over to see what the ruckus was about. Seeing was believing, so those who came also asked Jian Xingsui to mix their sauce too. So in the end, his action of helping Fu Jinxiao looked normal.After mixing a bowl, Jian Xingsui handed it to Fu Jinxiao: \u201cHere you are.\u201dShen Xingchen took a quick look and said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you put coriander, this thing is delicious.\u201dJian Xingsui, still holding the bowl, suddenly looked like he was guilty. His eyes were squinting, and he said hurriedly, \u201cAh, I forgot.\u201dFu Jinxiao took the seasoning bowl, raised his eyelids and looked at the people around him. His dark eyes seemed to be able to read people\u2019s hearts. Putting down the bowl, he commented, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t like to eat coriander.\u201dJian Xingsui smiled and said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s great, luckily I didn\u2019t put it.\u201dHis acting skills were really bad. Fu Jinxiao immediately knew Jian Xingsui\u2019s little lie. He was secretly pleased about it, though.At the end of the meal, some trainees probably expected that they were going to be eliminated, so they suppressed their sadness as much as they could. Because they were full of good food and wine, they lost a lot of their self-restraint and became bolder in front of the camera. Some trainees even dared to go to Instructor Tuya and said with a cheeky tone, \u201cTuya-jie, if I am eliminated tonight, can I ask for your autograph?\u201dTuya had a very good personality, so she easily agreed, \u201cOf course.\u201dSome people who have a better relationship with their instructor even boldly said: \u201cTuya-jie, can I get your WeChat contact?\u201dTuya smiled: \u201cNo problem.\u201dAfter those people who set a precedent, other trainees gradually became bolder. Many people looked at Fu Jinxiao intentionally or unintentionally, their hearts had the same thoughts. If they \u2013 somehow, by some miracle \u2013 could add Fu Jinxiao\u2019s WeChat contact, their journey in this show wouldn\u2019t be in vain. Even if they get eliminated tonight, having Fu Jinxiao as a WeChat friend was something to be bragged about in front of other colleagues and family members!But due to the majesty of King Fu, no one dared to really come up and ask.Under so many longing gazes, Fu Jinxiao put down his chopsticks, sighed softly, raised his head and said, \u201cYou can add my contact.\u201dAlthough no one dared to speak, many people immediately started cheering as soon as Actor Fu\u2019s words came out. Mobile phones were not allowed here, so someone came over with a small notebook and wanted to write it down by hand. With that, a group of people gathered around and added their contact information in a lively manner.Jian Xingsui also wanted to join, but couldn\u2019t make it.He envied those who were brave enough to come. But sadly, he could only watch helplessly, just like he had done many times before. He always could only look at the center of the crowd from a distance, watching the glow of the protagonist \u2013 the person who was destined to shine. In contrast, he was just an ordinary passerby, just another cannon fodder who would never get a moment in the spotlight.If he was good enough\u2026 if he was brave enough\u2026 maybe, he could also go up and asked for Fu Jinxiao\u2019s contact information\u2026Jian Xingsui curled up subconsciously. As he was feeling anxious in every possible way, a voice came from beside him, \u201cWhy are you in a daze here?\u201dHe came back to his senses and saw Shen Xingchen\u2019s face.Shen Xingchen kicked him lightly: \u201cGo if you want!\u201dJian Xingsui stood up from such a kick, stuttering: \u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d\u201cI, I, I, are you a repeating machine?\u201d Shen Xingchen snorted lightly, then pushed the younger man lightly, \u201cI can see what you actually want. Just hurry up, I think you\u2019ll succeed in getting his contact!\u201dPushed like this, Jian Xingsui fumbled into taking a few steps forward, and stood beside the crowd with a lost look. His heartbeat had never been so fast \u2013 he was so nervous, it was beyond any comprehensible words.However, at this moment, Fu Jinxiao in the crowd seemed to have noticed him and looked in his direction.Jian Xingsui opened his mouth, but forgot to move, and stood there in a daze.Fu Jinxiao looked at him for a while. There was a hint of fond smile in his eyes. He freed himself from the crowd and unhesitantly walked towards Jian Xingsui\u2019s direction. After he reached his destination, he teased the youth, with a deep, alluring voice that bewitched his soul, \u201cLooking for me?\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s heart raised to his throat, but he still nodded lightly. He mustered up every bit of courage he had, and said nervously, \u201cI think, I want to ask for your\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, what a coincidence. I also have something to ask you,\u201d Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice was slow, and he asked very politely: \u201cCan I have your WeChat contact, Comrade Little Jian?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Furthermore, it was the said actor who took the initiative.Was he dreaming right now? It must be, right?When he returned to his seat, Shen Xingchen sneered in annoyance: \u201cWhy are you acting as if you never added someone\u2019s WeChat in your life before?\u201dJian Xingsui glared at him angrily in response.Shen Xingchen finally calmed down a bit, and leaned closer and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret.\u201dJian Xingsui said, \u201cWhat secret?\u201d\u201cIf Fu-ge\u00a0added you, then maybe\u2026 this contact isn\u2019t like the one he gave to others,\u201d Shen Xingchen quietly lowered his voice, as if he\u2019s telling a big secret: \u201cYou know, some kind of work-only number? Business contact? It\u2019s usually managed by his assistants and other staff, and he basically almost never reads through all the messages. Though, more likely, he doesn\u2019t have the time to read all of it \u2013 he\u2019s very busy, why would he do that, when his assistant can manage it perfectly anyways?\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s heart suddenly beat uncontrollably, a hint of hesitant colored his voice: \u201cThen what do you mean?\u201d\u201cIf he added you, it should be his private number.\u201d Shen Xingchen said in a wise tone, in absolute contrast to his messy, spiky hair, \u201cYou are special to him, understand that?\u201dHearing that, Jian Xingsui smiled subconsciously, \u201cReally?\u201dShen Xingchen nodded, \u201cWhen have I lied to you?\u201dThe hot pot was boiling, but no matter how hot it was, it was not as hot as Jian Xingsui\u2019s heart. He felt that today might be the best day of his life. No matter how shitty his future ranking might be, it won\u2019t spoil his good mood.A mechanical female voice came from outside: \u201cAll trainees, please go to the hall on the first floor to gather after the meal.\u201dThis voice was as terrifying as The King of Hell\u2019s summoning order.Everyone looked at each other, and they all saw the same determination in each other\u2019s eyes. Some people took the lead to get up. With the current oppressive atmosphere, no one could eat anymore. Instead, they all went down to the lobby on the first floor. There were 56 seats placed on the opposite side of the lobby. The trainees were still standing nervously, as there were 108 of them. The meaning was obvious \u2013 half of them would be directly eliminated during this round.The instructors stood in the middle and watched all the trainees stand up one by one.Fu Jinxiao picked up the microphone, and spoke in a gentle tone: \u201cIs all the trainees of \u2018Starlight\u2019 currently present?\u201dEveryone raised their voices: \u201cAll here!\u201dThe voices resounded in unison throughout the gymnasium. Everyone came here with a dream and vigorous spirit. It might be the end for some of them, but they still put a brave face in front of the camera. They hoped the audiences would witness their fiery youth and brilliance.Fu Jinxiao glanced at everyone, and whispered: \u201cNow from left to right, start counting and introduce your name.\u201dThis was also the last chance for all of the trainees to introduce their existence in front of the big screen. It was akin to a glorious last spark of a dying star \u2013 leaving your youthful mark on the show, hoping the glitter would be remembered in the hearts of many.The first trainee, all the way on the left side, started shouting:\u201c\u2019Starlight\u2019 trainee Zhang Zhen, reporting for assembly!\u201d\u201c\u2019Starlight\u2019 trainee Ji Beichuan, reporting for assembly!\u201d\u201c\u2019Starlight\u2019 trainee Zhou Xun, reporting for assembly!\u201dIt was also at this moment that many audiences gradually realized that under the camera, there were many unfamiliar faces. Those who weren\u2019t given much screen time, yet they were still contestants who bet their future in the show. The audience might never see them again, as it was already time for a final farewell.After everyone reported their names, many people felt very happy after shouting their names loudly on the top of their lungs. It\u2019s as if they shouted away their anxieties alongside it.Instructor Tuya took the microphone and said with a smile: \u201cNow according to the order of your elimination in the previous game, please open the envelope in your hand. Please read your ranking aloud.\u201dFinally, this moment came.For Jian Xingsui, he could feel that his roommate, Wen Shengge was trembling beside him. Since the start of the show, this person has always been very good-natured and humorous. In front of the camera, he always had a witty quip with a happy demeanour. But in private, he was actually mostly a silent man. And it\u2019s clear that his clown-like persona was, well, a\u00a0persona.The first person to open the envelope came to the spotlight. He looked at his ranking for a moment, then he smiled a bright, joyful smile. He showed the content to everyone, while reading the words written there, \u201cJi Fei, your ranking in this stage is the 47th. Congratulations on entering the second stage!\u201dThe other cheered for him, his happiness was infectious.Ji Fei also hugged the others in a tight hug.Although, everyone actually knew that the ranking 46 \u2013 56 was actually on the bottom ten. That level of popularity was actually tepid, and their actual chance of debuting was slim to none. But currently, none of that matters. So long they could move up to another stage\u2026Tuya smiled and said, \u201cCongratulations, please go to your ranking seat.\u201dJi Fei ran to his own place, his happy smile made many people feel envious.Soon, most of the people shouted. Tuya looked at the list and read the name of the next trainee: \u201cShen Xingchen.\u201dShen Xingchen, who was standing next to his friend, nodded and opened his envelope. He was very confident. In fact, his popularity was also very high. There was nothing to worry about. Everyone guessed that he should be in the top 6, in the debut position.After Shen Xingchen opened it, seeing the name, his expression was solemn at first, and then he curled his lips into a smile. He was born with a ruffian air, coupled with his spiky hairstyle\u2019s unruly feeling, made him stand out among all the boys. His bad-boy appearance was a sharp weapon to attract little girls, so he played into that type as he spoke, \u201cShen Xingchen, your ranking in this stage is the 2nd. Congratulations on entering the second stage!\u201dJian Xingsui looked at Shen Xingchen, and Shen Xingchen patted the younger man\u2019s shoulders in return while saying, \u201cThis young master is waiting for you over there, you must accompany me, okay?\u201dHe was always so domineering.Perhaps under this dominance, there was a hint of gentleness and care.Wen Shengge was the most nervous one among them, and Tuya read his name next: \u201cWen Shengge, please open the envelope and read out your rank.\u201dFinally at this moment, Wen Shengge opened his envelope and read it. After seeing the content, he covered his lips to control his emotions, but tears still fell on the paper. He took a deep breath, trying to calm down his shaky voice, and read: \u201cWen Shengge, your final ranking in this stage is the 57th. Unfortunately, you will stop here.\u201dThere was a moment of silence at the scene.There was nothing more depressing than almost,\u00a0almost\u00a0making it. It was a hair breath away from succeeding. He was 57th, while the cut-off was 56.Wen Shengge was depressed, he couldn\u2019t stop his tears, and couldn\u2019t even hold the envelope with his shaky hands. Jian Xingsui, who was next to him, couldn\u2019t bear looking at him and patted him: \u201cI\u2026 Shengge\u2026 Don\u2019t be sad\u2026 Yo\u2013\u201dWen Shengge hugged Jian Xingsui tight, using him as an outlet of his bubbling emotions. His tears fell on Jian Xingsui\u2019s shoulder, wetting it with hot drops and choking sobs. Despite that, Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t dislike it, even wiped the tears on his cheeks for him, and said in a soft, soothing tone, \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u2026 your\u2026 uhm\u2026 your makeup will be messed up. You don\u2019t want the viewers to see it, right?\u201dWhat left unsaid was\u2014\u2018This may be the last \u2013 let\u2019s not leave a bad impression on everyone.\u2019Ning Ze also came over and patted Wen Shengge. He\u2019s not good with his words, so he couldn\u2019t find the perfect words to comfort him. But he believed that his action was understandable enough.Before Wen Shengge walked to the elimination area next to him, he gently gave his roommates another hug, and said, \u201cYou two \u2013 must stay and go on to the next stage for me.\u201dJian Xingsui felt a little sad for some reason.The audience was also a little sad out of sympathy. But they got an emotional whiplash when the camera turned to Jian Xingsui:[Can 20,000 yuan Brother succeed in getting his 20,000 yuan this time?][It\u2019s paid. It\u2019s paid.][Hahaha, he looks sad on the surface, but he\u2019s probably smiling inside.][Pretending to be sad~]More and more people read out their rankings, and the situation started to get worse.So far, all the people between the ranking 56-46 have finished reading, and almost all the people between the ranking 46-16 have been filled out. Even Ning Ze has entered his ranking position. Because Jian Xingsui was among the last to be eliminated in the battle royale game, his turn hadn\u2019t come up yet. There were not many positions left for him now, so at this point, he was either on the top spot or eliminated.The audience also gradually restrained their smiles from the initial teasing:[It\u2019s true!][Is 20,000 yuan Brother going to be eliminated?][Please not\u2026 I want to see him continue to be silly on the show.][I\u2019m not the type to be overly emotional in this kind of scene, but even I think it\u2019s a bit too sudden\u2026]Jian Xingsui himself was having a hard time. But what he didn\u2019t expect was that Shen Xingchen, who was waiting in the auditorium not far away, looked as if he was going through a worse situation.From the beginning, Shen Xingchen, who always liked to laugh, sat on the chair without saying a word.Among the four members of their dormitory, currently two members were promoted, one was eliminated, and last one was in a precarious position.Shen Xingchen never hid his emotions, his anxiety was written on the center of his brows. He might look like an uncaring person, but in truth, he was a very emotional person.Even the audience started to get anxious:[Can you hurry up?][20,000 yuan Brother is not really leaving.]Just when everyone was getting nervous, Fu Jinxiao took the microphone, and he said: \u201cIs there anyone who hasn\u2019t opened the envelope yet? Please raise your hand.\u201dThe contestants timidly raised their hands.There were Anran, Jian Xingsui, Li Xu\u2019an, Wei Jin and a couple of others who hadn\u2019t been called.Fu Jinxiao said: \u201cOkay, Li Xu\u2019an, you come first.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an had always been a relatively popular contestant. At first, he opened the envelope hesitantly, but not long after, he smiled confidently, letting everyone see the envelope while he read it out loud: \u201cCongratulations Li Xu\u2019an, you have won first place in this stage and successfully entered the second stage!\u201dThe audience was in an uproar, many players stood up to congratulate him. The atmosphere was very lively.If Li Xu\u2019an was the first place and Shen Xingchen was the second place, then Anran must be in third place. Many people think so, and according to the popularity ranking, it should be like this.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyelids and glanced at Anran lightly, and said, \u201cAnran, it\u2019s your turn.\u201dAnran was called on, and he took a deep breath and walked forward. He was smiling when he opened his envelope, but when he saw the words written there, his smile was a little dull.Many contestants didn\u2019t understand what it meant, but their confusion was cleared when Anran read it loudly: \u201cJian Anran, your ranking in this stage is the 4th. Congratulations on entering the second stage!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since the recording of the show, everyone knew of Anran\u2019s staggering popularity. How could he be in 4th place? If his level of popularity\u00a0only\u00a0gave him the 4th place\u2026 then who was the 3rd?Fu Jinxiao was not surprised. In his heart, he knew who was more deserving of the 3rd ranking. He looked at the trembling youth beside him and said, \u201cJian Xingsui, your turn.\u201dJian Xingsui stood stiff, rooted on his spot when he was called. The envelope in his hand felt clammy, it seemed to be soaked with his sweat. When he arrived at the show, he really only wanted that 20,000 yuan consolation prize because he was desperate for money.But\u2026 after many days of gruelling practice with everyone, after meeting such good roommates who became his genuine friends, after meeting fair mentors who actually cared for him\u2026 he became greedy. Nobody wouldn\u2019t, without an exception. He was getting good treatment now, he wasn\u2019t satisfied in getting less. It was human nature \u2013 to want a mile after getting an inch.Jian Xingsui lowered his head and began to open the envelope. When he looked down and saw the writing on the envelope, the hand holding the envelope even trembled slightly. In the end, the buzz-cut boy\u2019s eye was reddened with tears. It dripped into hot droplets through his cheek, into the sweat-soaked envelope.Fu Jinxiao reminded the youth: \u201cPlease read your letter out loud.\u201dJian Xingsui took a deep breath, trying his best to make himself look calm enough, and finally began to read: \u201cJian Xingsui, your ranking in this stage is the 3rd. Congratulations on entering the second stage!\u201d\u2014After it was read out loud, everyone fell into a deafening silence.Anran\u2019s expression was even uglier. He wasn\u2019t reconciled with the result! He had always been at the top of the list! But now Jian Xingsui, that insignificant nobody, who came out halfway out of nowhere, took all the limelight.\u00a0His\u00a0limelight.Many trainees also couldn\u2019t believe the result. But some of them took the lead to react. They jumped up and cheered, congratulating the third place winner. Shen Xingchen even jumped three feet high and yelled excitedly, \u201cYou are promoted! You made it! Third place!!\u201dJian Xingsui trembled a little when he read it himself. He couldn\u2019t believe he was promoted, much less placed as the 3rd. He tried to speak, but his lips moved without any sounds uttered out.Seeing his bewildered look, Fu Jinxiao curled his lips, bemused, \u201cPlease move to the promotion area.\u201dAfter Jian Xingsui came over, he needed to make a speech for the show. But his head was filled with fog, so he really didn\u2019t know what to say. So he just muddled through.The thing is, he knew a little about his predicted ranking. Just after the Weibo incident happened, his ranking was 25th. It was smack-dab in the middle. Of course, he didn\u2019t expect his ranking would soar up into the 3rd after the clarification was given by the crew. It seemed that thanks to that controversy, he actually got more popular. Maybe because after his fans were abused by the malicious editing, they fought back in retaliation?Fu Jinxiao asked him without turning his head, \u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t know what to say, so he just told him the truth, \u201cI\u2019m very excited, because\u2026 uhm, I didn\u2019t expect this ranking. I thought\u2026 my best result was just\u2026 barely scraping into the promotion\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao had never seen such a sincere, yet foolish person.The actor\u2019s gaze darkened. After Jian Xingsui met his gaze, he knew that there was a high probability that he had said the wrong thing again, so he shrank his neck a little timidly.Fortunately, Actor Fu did not reprimand him. Instead, he just turned around and looked at other contestants, be it those who were promoted and those who were eliminated. Some people were mired in despair and self-pity, while the other was happily chattering, radiating pure joy as they congratulated each other for being \u201clucky\u201d enough.Fu Jinxiao said into his microphone: \u201cWho among you all, today, already predicted your current ranking?\u201dIn the audience \u2013 more than a hundred people, no one could reply.\u201cThen, let me ask another question: are you satisfied with your current ranking?\u201d Fu Jinxiao glanced at everyone, his gaze sharpened, \u201cIs this ranking the highest you can reach? Are you satisfied with your current results? Or, are you willing to stop here?\u201dHe was still greeted with silence.Fu Jinxiao raised his voice a little, his patience wearing dangerously thin, \u201cYes or no?\u201dThe question finally woke them all up. All the contestants replied in unison: \u201cNot satisfied!\u201dFu Jinxiao\u2019s lips upturned in a slight, amused smile, \u201cThen I will tell you now: it\u2019s useless to be willing.\u201d\u201c?\u201dThe contestants originally thought that Actor Fu was here to motivate them. Instead, he spoke like this? What does he actually mean? Everyone looked at each other for a while, stunned stupid without anything to say.Fu Jinxiao gave them a clarification.\u201cThe variety show \u2018Starlight\u2019 is a live broadcast. Your every move was displayed for them to see and judge. There might be an edited version, but the audience could still see your every choreography mistake, every off-tune singing, and such. It\u2019s easy to disappoint them, and it\u2019s even possible to make your fellow competitor look good in comparison.\u201d\u201cAnd so, now that the first stage is over, you say that you are not satisfied. Tell me, is it useful?\u201d Fu Jinxiao\u2019s stern gaze swept over everyone, \u201cWill your useless words be able to win back the hearts of fans? Or, can you correct your previous mistake? Am I wrong to say this?\u201dIt was like a wake-up call, harshly knocking on everyone\u2019s hearts.Just when everyone was deep in thought, Fu Jinxiao changed the subject again, \u201cHowever, everyone makes mistakes.\u201d\u201cIn 2005, I participated in a singing competition. I remember that my instructor at that time asked me to sing another song as an extra test. I made a horrible mistake and it resulted in me failing the audition. That instructor\u2026 he questioned my sheer unprofessionalism. What kind of singer can\u2019t sing on the spot? Even some of my fans were disappointed and left me. At that time, only one loyal fan kept sending me comments on my Weibo to cheer me up. They asked me to keep moving forward, to not let this one mistake discourage me, and keep working hard towards my goal.\u201d Fu Jinxiao explained slowly, a hint of fondness in his deep, melodic voice.This kind of past failure was unknown to most people, and it made everyone laugh.Only Jian Xingsui in the back, who didn\u2019t smile.As Fu Jinxiao\u2019s loyal fan\u2026 of course he intimately knew of that event. It made him somber thinking about it.Fu Jinxiao had a panoramic view of everyone\u2019s expressions. He then brought the topic back, \u201cSome of you may be eliminated today like me at that time, but I want to tell you that a mistake does not determine your life. In return, for those who were promoted, the current success does not mean that you will not make mistakes in the future. If this time, you get through because of sheer luck, and think that with your fluke mentality you can do it again, you will find that it\u2019s absolutely impossible to succeed in the end. Understand?\u201dThe trainees were still stunned silly.Fu Jinxiao frowned slightly. He didn\u2019t yell loudly, but asked again in a lower tone, \u201cUnderstand?\u201dAfter that, all of the trainees spoke loudly in unison, \u201cUnderstand!!\u201dThose simple words stabilized the hearts of the trainees who were originally in complicated moods. Especially for Jian Xingsui, who was standing closest to the actor.With that speech, he could feel Fu Jinxiao\u2019s overall planning ability and sheer charisma. This man had that leader-like quality. He could easily control the overall situation by observing his surroundings. He grasped everyone\u2019s heart by his story, and made everyone follow the pace he set.Again, Fu Jinxiao sneaked a glance at Jian Xingsui.Jian Xingsui could feel the stare, so he suddenly answered the actor face-to-face, all timid like a primary school student who was pointed by his teacher. \u201cU-understand!\u201dHearing his answer, Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrow, speaking in a casual tone to his microphone, \u201cDo you still want to run away with that 20,000 yuan?\u201dThinking about it, the audience didn\u2019t expect that Fu Jinxiao would use this event as an example. But with just a simple joke, he neutralized the previous serious atmosphere. At the same time, he gave his favorite contestant another shot. Truly, Actor Fu\u2019s ability to direct the limelight on the field was top-notch.Jian Xingsui\u2019s earlobes instantly turned red, and he murmured, \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dFu Jinxiao said, \u201cAre you sure?\u201dThis time, he didn\u2019t need Actor Fu\u2019s guidance. Jian Xingsui took a deep breath, and solemnly said into the microphone: \u201cI\u2019m sure!\u201d\u201cVery good,\u201d A faint smile appeared on Fu Jinxiao\u2019s handsome face, and he waved his hand slowly. When chatting with the youth, he was a little more casual and intimate. He continued his teasing, \u201cThen go back to your ranking position, my third place.\u201dThe sexy and lazy voice made his ears numb. Jian Xingsui felt that if he stayed longer, his hands and feet would pathetically become limp and out of sync. Wanting his dignity to be intact, he quickly returned to his teammates as if he was running away. After he sat beside the second-place Shen Xingchen, he finally could let out the breath he held.Jian Xingsui knew that his current ranking was the result of many, many factors intertwining.It\u2019s clear one of them was because of Shen Xingchen \u2014 this brash, bold, talented young master who kept tagging alongside Jian Xingsui. In contrast, Jian Xingsui was very naive, and the viewers loved this kind of gap between the two friends. Another factor was the special attention of the two instructors: Fu Jinxiao and Tuya. The two of them, and also other instructors, liked this honest and hard-working kid. Of course, the last factor was his own work, but that one was a given.Combining all of these, it\u2019s clear that his ranking would be sky-high.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 30.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMany people talked about the shocking ranking announcement.Actor Fu\u2019s agent, Wang Meican, was one of many who did the same. The said agent kept babbling on and on to voice her disbelief. This made Fu Jinxiao feel annoyed after listening for a short while, so he directly went to the smoking room next to the left stairway. In the room, he relaxed, leaned against the window and lit a cigarette. With a smoke in hand, hearing the rant of his agent became bearable.Wang Meican sighed and said: \u201cAt least listen to this bit, will you? Really\u2026 the major entertainment agencies have already signed contracts with the show. They already\u2026 bribed them, so to speak. As a result, it\u2019s clear that the top 6 debut position has basically been pre-determined. It\u2019s dirty work, but that\u2019s how it is in this industry\u2026 I know that you have a crush on that kid and want to help him. But if you give him hope now, wouldn\u2019t it be more painful when his hope are dashed later?\u201dFu Jinxiao held a cigarette between his slender fingers, and blew out the smoke artfully. He was still leaning against the window, his movement languid yet willful, as if what Wang Meican say was just nonsense.\u201cYou know this kind of thing better than me, right?\u201d Wang Meican put her hand on her waist, \u201cAnd look at his broken agency, why is it called Bankrupt Entertainment, dear god. Anyways, you asked me to check that agency some time ago, and I found out what kind of agency it is. Let me tell you the truth, that agency won\u2019t hold on for long. Besides Li Xu\u2019an, it doesn\u2019t have any more outstanding trainees. So even if Jian Xingsui has potential to debut, his agency can\u2019t give benefit to debut both him and Li Xu\u2019an. It\u2019s futile.\u201dFu Jinxiao finally replied, \u201cI just want to see how far he can go with his own ability. Besides, the ranking besides the final one could still be won by his own hand. Even if he fails in the end, I won\u2019t interfere with the decision.\u201dWang Meican then breathed a sigh of relief.To be honest, she suddenly couldn\u2019t sit still and rushed over because she watched the last latest live broadcasts. Did other people can\u2019t see what she saw? Fu Jinxiao\u2019s love for this youth had surpassed that of other juniors in the past. If she didn\u2019t interfere, or at least, ask about it now\u2026 Then she\u2019s afraid the next news she got would be their official relationship announcement. She would be the last to know.Now it seemed that it hadn\u2019t reached that boiling point yet.Just as he was thinking, there was a sound from the stairway next door. A phone call came in, speaking in a familiar voice. As he leaned against the wall, Jian Xingsui accepted the call and greeted politely, \u201cHello, Wang-ge.\u201dThe man on the other side of the phone, Wang-ge,\u00a0has been Jian Xingsui\u2019s agent for a year.After their public recording was over, the show crew returned everyone\u2019s mobile phone. This also included Jian Xingsui, but he didn\u2019t expect that the first person to contact him was actually his agent.The agent said with a meaningful smile1, \u201cXingsui, you really make me proud, giving me a good face for nurturing the third-place rank!\u201dJian Xingsui smiled shyly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dWang-ge\u00a0said cheerfully, \u201cI knew you had this talent, so it\u2019s not wrong to let you participate in this variety show.\u201dJian Xingsui was also a little happy in his heart for being recognized by others. This also compounds the feeling he got that today might be his luckiest and happiest day in his life.Wang-ge\u00a0put away his smile, and said softly, \u201cI have some good news for you.\u201dJian Xingsui replied in an equally soft voice, \u201cWhat good news?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you join the show for 20,000 yuan? I know you are short of money.\u201d The middle-aged agent continued in a cloying tone, \u201cDid you know that today some\u2026 company actually contacted us. They offered a price of one million yuan, so long as you announced that you voluntarily quit the show due to illness before the second ranking. After you do that, the money will be wired directly to your account.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s smile froze on his face.Ye Wang\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d made the youth\u2019s body feel it grew colder. He also slowly leaned his back against the wall, as if he couldn\u2019t support the weight of his body. The previous sense of happiness seemed to instantly disappear without a trace, and despair grew from his heart like a vine \u2014 it entangled his lung, his limbs \u2014 so, so tight, leaving him gasping for oxygen, desperate for a gulp of air.Jian Xingsui tried his best to make his voice steady, and asked softly, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThe older man thought he still didn\u2019t understand, so he simply said, \u201cSuisui, there are some things you still don\u2019t understand because you\u2019re still young. You see, although you are now in third place, that ranking won\u2019t be yours for long. In fact, the top six have already decided from before the show was filming. I know you have a good relationship with Shen Xingchen, right? Didn\u2019t he tell you that his agency has long signed an agreement with the program\u2019s crew? Besides, he is the second son of that Shen family, there\u2019s no way he won\u2019t debut. Wise yourself up and face the reality, Suisui. Those times where you all call each other \u2018brothers\u2019? Forget them, those were just purely for the camera.\u201dJian Xingsui held his phone and said nothing.His breathing began to return to normal, but he still refused to speak. He tried his best to stabilize his tumultuous emotions raging inside.\u201cYou should also understand that you aren\u2019t very good at dancing and singing, so of course it\u2019s impossible for you to debut in an idol group, yeah?\u201d Wang-ge\u00a0seems to have grasped Jian Xingsui\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, \u201cYou can tell the difference between 20,000 and one million. Let\u2019s take the easy route and not continue to participate. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201dAcross the two of them, hidden behind the stairwell, was a pair of people \u2013 both dead quiet.Fu Jinxiao leaned against the railing, his handsome face was expressionless with unreadable emotions. The cigarette between his fingers was burning little by little, and the ash slowly fell to the ground. But the man stood still, completely unmoving.The time seemed to stretch until forever \u2013 a minute felt like a century.Finally, Jian Xingsui said in firm conviction, \u201cI want to continue participating in the show.\u201dHis agent thought that Jian Xingsui was obviously stupid, \u201cWhy are you so bull-headed? You want to quit after the recording is over??\u201dHearing that made Jian Xingsui hesitate for a while. He remembered when the ranking announcement happened just today, especially when Fu Jinxiao\u2019s gaze seemed to bore into his soul, asking him if he still wanted 20,000 yuan in a soft tone. At that time, he firmly answered that he no longer wanted that money.At that time, he was poor, in a dire condition, without a scrap of family support \u2013 he had nothing and no one. He wasn\u2019t crazy smart, he could only think one step of a time, and that step happened to be making money. He could only bite the bullet and participate in this show to get that 20,000 yuan despite knowing that the protagonist was also here. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers, after all.But now?But now\u2026 he somehow gained great friends, and was able to communicate with his long-cherished idol. He felt that his gloomy life now had some bright, hopeful spots.Just like the magic disguising Cinderella, it will vanish after the midnight clock strikes. Jian Xingsui could only wait for the other shoe to drop, for his life to continue as usual, for this happy dream to end.He was short of money, but he was even more short of love.And\u2014 there was a non-zero chance that his friends were fake, never consider him a brother like he does. It was possible for Fu Jinxiao to actually not care about someone as insignificant as him.But\u2026 in the end, he believed that his life could still be turned around. That little bit of light was within his reach.\u201cI won\u2019t quit.\u201d Jian Xingsui said firmly, \u201cI don\u2019t want that million either.\u201dAcross the wall, Fu Jinxiao\u2019s eyes brightened as he flashed a faint smile. He flicked the cigarette ash, avoiding his slender fingertips.He seemed to be deep in thought, and this action made Wang Meican a little nervous. Because this was a tell-tale sign that Actor Fu was actually serious.Wang-ge\u00a0became livid, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201dJian Xingsui instantly replied, \u201cI\u2019m not crazy.\u201d\u201cI promised you that money and you\u00a0dare\u00a0to refuse?\u201d Agent Wang turned around angrily, \u201cNo. You don\u2019t have a say in this matter. You must listen to this arrangement. Do you know, even if you stay, you won\u2019t be able to debut anyway. So, what the hell are you just doing? Remember, you are still signed with the agency. Do you think the higher-ups will let you do whatever you want?\u201dThe threat was palpable, but Jian Xingsui remained silent.He understood every bit of it, but he didn\u2019t react. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t care, but he was numb with this kind of turn of event. He already knew his life sucks, nothing good rarely happens. It\u2019s natural for him to accept the worst possible outcome.He lived through it many, many times. It only made him stronger.The phone was hung up one-sidedly, and the stairwell was turned back into its previous calm. After the conversation, Jian Xingsui simply left without crying or fussing.Sometimes, the more silent someone is in the face of injustice, the more distressing it feels.It\u2019s clear to Fu Jinxiao that Jian Xingsui was used to\u2026 this.Wang Meican looked at the silent actor and said in a whisper, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cI was thinking.\u201d Fu Jinxiao threw the cigarette butt into the ashtray, walked to the sofa next to him and sat down. He crossed his slender legs, and looked up to his agent, \u201cHas our agency not signed a new star for a long time?\u201dWang Meican was shocked!Fu Jinxiao\u2019s agency was the largest and most well-known in the industry \u2013 Fenghua Entertainment. As a company under the famous Fu Conglomerate, Fenghua Entertainment naturally had the best resources and the absolute right to speak. Today\u2019s top artists, stars, and singers in the industry generally came from this agency. It could be said that this was a company that you can\u2019t enter\u00a0even\u00a0if you have countless connections.1remember this is a 3rd POV omniscient, so despite the agent speaking from the phone, he was still fully described by the narration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He became even more unhappy.Jian Xingsui took a deep breath and said to him, \u201cWe must keep in touch after all of this.\u201dWen Shengge nodded, \u201cFor sure.\u201dShen Xingchen sat on the edge of the upper bunk bed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can\u2019t leave now, anyways. It\u2019s already night so all the gates are tightly locked.\u201dThis sentence knocked down the original warm atmosphere into pieces.Wen Shengge carried his suitcase, looked around at his friends and said, \u201cAlthough I was eliminated, I really hope that you three can go further until debut. In fact, you don\u2019t have to feel sorry for me, my agency had already lined me up with several acting jobs for web dramas. It should be pretty good, a job is a job in the end. Besides, I will participate in other variety shows in the future, and I will still get paid. I don\u2019t need to force myself and pretend to do crazy things in front of the audience to ensure my quality of life. Look, I\u2019m actually pretty relaxed.\u201dWen Shengge looked at Jian Xingsui again and said, \u201cAs for Chen-ge, he doesn\u2019t have to worry, his final ranking definitely won\u2019t be bad. I\u2019m more worried about Suisui and Ze-ge.\u201dNing Ze sat on the edge of the bed and said in a deep voice, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Wen Shengge shook his head, \u201cZe-ge, you are already 28 years old this year, the oldest here with us. I know that this variety show is your last chance, if you fail to make your debut\u2026 maybe you will have to give up this path.\u201dAt 28 years old, he was considered very old as a rookie idol group member.Ning Ze was usually taciturn, maybe not many people have noticed him, but Wen Shengge understood how difficult Ning Ze has been through ups and downs these years. He didn\u2019t accept unspoken rules, he couldn\u2019t charm someone out with his words, he didn\u2019t have special talent. However, he loved the stage very, very much.But, he always got eliminated in the end.This time, \u201cStarlight\u201d was really Ning Ze\u2019s last chance.Wen Shengge said, \u201cZe-ge, you must not give up, and you must be more selfish to get more screen time. There are six debut positions this time, and I heard there\u2019s only one of them that\u2019s still unconfirmed. It is reserved for a popular trainee. You can win this position.\u201dNing Ze\u2019s lips curled into a smile, and he finally nodded.Wen Shengge looked at Jian Xingsui again, he sighed and said, \u201cSuisui, I\u2019m actually worried about you the most.\u201dJian Xingsui said softly, \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cYou have always been under a lot of pressure, right ? Now that you are the third ranked trainee, you will face even more public criticism.\u201d Wen Shengge understood his struggle. He continued, \u201cEspecially if your agency doesn\u2019t give its all to support you. Your future road will not be an easy path to thread.\u201d\u201cYou know\u2026 sometimes I find you looking lost in your thoughts. I know you\u2019re the type who keeps your feelings tight inside your heart. Somehow, I think I could understand what bothers you. But still, if you encounter something you can\u2019t face by yourself, you need to learn to talk to others. Discuss it, tell others about it, and maybe you\u2019ll get the answer to that trouble. Ze-ge\u00a0and Chen-ge\u00a0are trustworthy people, don\u2019t you think?\u201dWen Shengge\u2019s words softened Jian Xingsui\u2019s heart.Jian Xingsui felt his nose was a little sour, and replied with a soft whisper, \u201cI know, I know, I will do as you say. Take care of yourself.\u201dShen Xingchen who was still sitting on his bed said, \u201cHey hey hey! Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re going to die or never see us again in this life! It\u2019s enough that we can\u2019t get together every now and then on this show.\u201dDespite his seemingly callous words, everyone could hear the shakiness of Shen Xingchen\u2019s words.Having said that, everyone knew that after this show, it would be a monumental task for all four of them to gather and chat around like this. The days where they could laugh all day and only moan about training were ending sooner or later.This kind of parting is happening in every dormitory.Before all the contestants could react and adjust, the next day came with the second stage\u2019s group and music selection. All the contestants were called together and waited anxiously.When they arrived at the assembly hall, they felt the difference. This place was usually crowded to the brim, but now it suddenly became much more spacious. Before, everyone would complain about the lack of space. But now when there\u2019s suddenly enough space, nobody could bring themselves to smile.As the trainees continued to whisper to one another, the instructors came inside one by one.Fu Jinxiao usually wears a white sportswear, but today he changed into a black one. The black loose coat made him look calmer and subdued. His hairstyle was also much more casual than usual. It was parted naturally, styled with a slight wave, and tucked behind his ears. He completed the look with a gold-rimmed spectacle, making him like a retro-styled gentleman.Every trainee suddenly remembered the netizens\u2019 evaluation of this actor: he\u2019s a man who can live off his looks alone, but he chose to rely on his acting strength instead.Fu Jinxiao picked up his microphone and said in a calm tone, \u201cIs everyone here?\u201dThe trainees came back to their senses and said in unison: \u201cAll here!\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded in response, then he began to say, \u201cFirst of all, congratulations on entering the second stage. However, this is not something worth relaxing. Because, what you will face next are more brutal training and harsher selection. I hope that everyone will realize that from today onwards, you have to be mentally prepared for every step of the way.\u201dWhen he was this serious, no one dared to deny him otherwise.Almost all the trainees put away some of their other thoughts, stood up and answered, \u201cYes!\u201dThen Instructor Li came out to ease the atmosphere. He spoke with a more cheerful tone, \u201cWe are going to select your second stage\u2019s music performance today. The second selection itself will be different than before. We have increased the competition between groups \u2013 that is to say, it will be a battle between groups. Lastly, we have added a \u2018creative group1\u2019 for this stage.\u201dSome trainees became excited when they heard it.\u201cThe creative group is a very special group. They will not get any song to choose from. The trainees in the group need to complete everything, from the lyrics to the melody. You have 7 days total, so anyone who chooses this group will need extra preparation.\u201d Instructor Li didn\u2019t mince his words. He then continued, \u201cIf it isn\u2019t completed within these 7days, we will still broadcast it live, and you will have to bear the consequences by yourself. Don\u2019t joke about your future. Don\u2019t choose this group if you have the attitude of wanting to \u2018try\u2019 your luck. No zuo no die2\u00a0and all that jazz, remember?\u201dThe audience in the broadcast room laughed.[Instructor Li is worthy of being called the joyful comedian.][Try your luck and die~][How brave are the people who chose this group.]The moment the microphone was in Fu Jinxiao\u2019s hand once again, everyone quieted.Actor Fu scanned the crowd as he spoke, \u201cFrom now on, let\u2019s start to choose your song and group selection. We\u2019ll do it in descending order of the ranking.\u201dThis rule was undoubtedly favorable for the top-ranked trainees.Li Xu\u2019an was the first ranking and he chose the creative group.The second ranked Shen Xingchen chose a song that fits his image. He wasn\u2019t talented in composing, and instead he chose to play to his strengths and avoid his weaknesses.When it was Jian Xingsui\u2019s turn, he chose the creative group with no hesitation.Tuya nodded, showing a satisfied smile. She had always felt that Jian Xingsui\u2019s composing talent was very high, but she never particularly praised it in public. Instead, she questioned his professional ability in dancing. Now that Jian Xingsui was in the creative group, Tuya was positive it\u2019s time for the youth to flex his musical talents.Jian Xingsui stood in the area designated for the creative group.Li Xu\u2019an politely smiled and said, \u201cLet\u2019s have a pleasant cooperation.\u201dJian Xingsui shook his hand.What he didn\u2019t expect was that the creative group would be so popular. The fourth ranked Anran also came to the creative group without any hesitation. He smiled sweetly at everyone: \u201cI\u2019m here~\u201dHearing his greeting, Jian Xingsui could only smile in greeting.He wasn\u2019t as afraid of Anran as he was before. After going through a lot of things, he became much calmer.In the first ranking, Zhou Xun\u2019s ranking wasn\u2019t very low. There was no surprise in his choice \u2014 In order to follow Anran, he also joined the creative group. The final two members of the group were people who Jian Xingsui was not familiar with.The six people had wildly different ideas, and it was inevitable that their path would be a rocky one.After everyone was divided into groups, the six of them came to the training room assigned to them together, sat on the ground and began to introduce themselves and get to know each other.The remaining two members introduced themselves:\u201cHello, I\u2019m Zhang Jiajia, and I prefer to sing.\u201d\u201cHello, I\u2019m Zuo An. I usually rap, street dance, and I can write songs by myself.\u201dJian Xingsui and the others also followed suit with their introduction.As the person with the highest ranking here, Li Xu\u2019an had an inexplicable sense of superiority. He had not yet been elected as the captain, but he had already begun to give our command, \u201cOkay, basically everyone has seen the other\u2019s public performance, so we are all familiar with each other, right? We only have seven days, and the time is very tight, so I won\u2019t say much else. Since we are all members of the creative group, we must have some ideas, yeah? Let\u2019s agree on the theme first, and then we will create a performance to match with it. Besides that, does anyone have anything to say?\u201dZhou Xun said, \u201cI think we should choose a captain first?\u201dLi Xu\u2019an was very confident: \u201cThen who shall we vote to be the captain? I have experience as a captain before. I think I should be able to lead everyone well.\u201dAnran smiled slightly, \u201cI also think Xu\u2019an-gege3\u00a0can do the job very well.\u201dIf this was in the past, Jian Xingsui would immediately agree.But not long ago, he learned that he should not be able to make his debut, and that the stage performance husband may be his last. This changes things.For many unknown days and nights, he took a pen to write down the emotions in his heart that had nowhere to vent. He wrote many songs, but none of them saw the light of day \u2013 they could only end up all dusty on his bookshelf.In the previous life, Anran was shining and glowing, while he died of depression when the protagonist was at his peak in life. In this life, he also knew that he might not be a shining person, but this stage may be the last time he could perform in front of his idol and everyone, singing the song he wrote by himself.He remembered Wen Shengge\u2019s words: \u201cYou have to go on in my place.\u201dHe wanted to perform well on his last stage. He had been passive before, and that could only get him so far. This time, he wanted to be right for himself and for the hope others had placed in him.Jian Xingsui raised his hand and said, \u201cI also want to run for captaincy.\u201d1I chose \u2018creative\u2019 instead of \u2018composer\u2019 because they are also required to choreograph the dance as well.2a slang that have the same vibe of \u201cfuck around and find out\u201d.

But he knew he was in front of the camera, so he forced a smile as he replied, \u201cWe all know you have experience, Little Jian.\u201dAnran, who was sitting next to Jian Xingsui, pursed his lips.Seeing that Jian Xingsui wanted to be the captain, he argued, \u201cSuisui, Xu\u2019an-gege\u00a0is very experienced. Besides, he has also composed many songs. In comparison, haven\u2019t you just graduated from a Music Academy recently? You must have less experience than Xu\u2019an-gege.\u201dJian Xingsui did not give up: \u201cAlthough I have just graduated, I know I will not be much worse than others.\u201dAfter Zhou Xun listened to his words and sneered in response, deliberately provoking trouble, \u201cIf you are brave enough to claim that, how about you and Xu\u2019an-ge\u00a0both create a song within a day. We can publicly vote which one is better.\u201dJian Xing Sui knew about Zhou Xun and Anran\u2019s close relationship.So undoubtedly, they would support each other\u2019s opinion.But this was his last chance, he had no choice but to nod, \u201cOkay.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an was riding a tiger1. In reality, he didn\u2019t have a particularly high creative talent. Most of his previous creations were actually written by ghostwriters. This time, his bid for the captaincy was actually planned long ago. When the time comes, he would secretly ask his agent to pay someone to write a song for him. He could also use this occasion to establish his image as a talented genius in composing.But Zhou Xun, this troublemaking piece of turd, suddenly suggested that. Where the fuck would he find a good song within a day??On the other hand, Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t know the others\u2019 complicated thoughts. After deciding on his goals, he didn\u2019t waste any time and immediately walked aside and started to do it.Anran comforted Li Xu\u2019an and said, \u201cXu\u2019an-gege, just do your best, I believe you can!\u201dLi Xu\u2019an smiled while forcing down his heated heart..He had no choice but to bite the bullet and get in front of the computer and begin to pretend to write lyrics and compose the melody. At first he could pretend, but later he found that he always felt uncontrollable \u2013 no inspiration came to him, so he kept going to the toilet or distracting himself by talking to others.As for Jian Xingsui, he was immersed in his creative process. He could go on about all morning, seemingly unmoving from his table.At night, many trainees have left to rest. Only Jian Xingsui remained.The next day, about 4 or 5 in the morning, Li Xu\u2019an couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, and took the initiative to come over and said, \u201cSuisui, why don\u2019t you\u2026 go to rest?\u201dJian Xingsui smiled \u2013 he looked tired, but his eyes were still bright. It seemed he was a bit startled, as if he had been pulled out of his own world. \u201cNo, Xu\u2019an-ge, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not sleepy.\u201dAt this moment, Li Xu\u2019an suddenly felt that in this tenacious state, Jian Xingsui had a quality of ruthless focus that was a bit scary. It made Jian Xingsui seemingly able to take everything and anything fearlessly. Jian Xingsui looked like someone who was very determined to win \u2013 even if he had to sacrifice his well-being.\u201c\u2026\u201dWas this second stage so important to him?Li Xu\u2019an really couldn\u2019t figure it out. But since he had no way out of his sticky situation, he could only continue to try to compose a song with his best ability.When the one-day deadline came, the six of them got together. Jian Xingsui and Li Xu\u2019an, who were competing for captaincy, both presented their own composition.Li Xu\u2019an\u2019s song was called \u201cPeak of War2\u201c. It had cool, radical lyrics, with some nice rhymes here and there. The overall feeling of the song was that of a bragging song, the kind that shouting out \u201cmy father is going to blow up the sky!\u201d.Jian Xingsui\u2019s song was called \u201cShimmer3\u201d.When everyone saw the title of the song, they thought it would be a tender love song. They didn\u2019t expect that the lyrics of this song were very subtle yet restrained. It was powerfully emotional. And the most impressive thing was that there were rap parts in the middle, with soulful lyrics and clever rhymes. All in all, it moved people by just reading the written lyrics.\u300aMaybe I am just a shimmering light, but I also shine it on you.\u300b\u300aMaybe I am just a shimmering light, but I want to be the one who give you the brilliance.\u300b\u300aAmong the sea of stars, I am just a sparkle of dust, or maybe a stray light. But I want to quietly illuminate you alone in the dark night.\u300b\u300aIn this lonely hour.\u300b\u300aNo matter where I am, I will continue to glitter, giving you an infinite gleam.\u300bThe lyrics might be a bit simple and repetitive, but it gave an overall sense of cohesion beauty. It felt heartwarming, with a palpable sense of longing.Between the two choices, it was clear which one was the winner. Jian Xingsui\u2019s creation was very impressive.Li Xu\u2019an stiffly smiled and said, \u201cI already have a clue about the melodic arrangement of \u201cPeak of War\u201d, and we will have a musician to guide us later.\u201dThis sentence was a clear hint of canvassing vote.Anran silently put down the lyrics page. He looked at Jian Xingsui meaningfully, and said, \u201cI also think \u2018Peak of War\u2019 is good.\u201dZhou Xun has been more impressed with \u201cShimmer\u201d, but when he heard Anran say this, he finally decided to mimic Anran\u2019s action and said, \u201cI also support \u2018Peak of War\u2019, I think this song is very good.\u201dThe other two members thought that \u201cShimmer\u201d was better, but they didn\u2019t dare to go against the first and fourth ranking men. Naturally, they had no choice but to choose \u201cPeak of War\u201d.Jian Xingsui held his lyrics book and said: \u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t arranged the composition of \u2018Shimmer\u2019, I can arrange and create it according to everyone\u2019s situation.\u201dHe was still thinking about struggling to win everyone\u2019s votes.But he didn\u2019t expect that his musical arrangement didn\u2019t matter if nobody chose him.The other two members laughed, trying to diffuse the situation, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, you can save yourself trouble. Xu\u2019an-ge\u2019s song already has a ready-made melody, so it\u2019s more convenient also, right?\u201dJian Xingsui held on to his lyrics book and refused to back down.This was his hard work, and it was also the result he showed to the audience and everyone to see.But Li Xu\u2019an started to make a decision: \u201cSince it\u2019s decided, let\u2019s start creating together. Suisui, can you come over and help me change \u2018Peak of War\u2019 lyrics? In fact, I also think some of the words could be better.\u201dJian Xingsui knew that the matter was a foregone conclusion, so he had no choice but to put it down and come to join the team.Regarding the division of labor, Li Xu\u2019an asked Zhou Xun to compose the choreography, Anran and Jian Xingsui to arrange the song, and the others to follow suit and help around. But soon, they found themselves in a bottleneck. The lyrics of the song \u201cPeak of War\u201d were too difficult to memorize. Coupled that with the high notes of the melody, which means that the dance moves have to be difficult as well to match the song. This was like adding insult to injury for Zhou Xun, who choreographed the dance.At 3 or 4 in the morning, Jian Xingsui came to the training room from the dormitory.\u201cSqueak!\u201dThe door opened and he walked in.Zhou Xun, who was smoking in the corner, was so startled that his cigarette fell to the ground.Jian Xingsui gave him a deep look, and said: \u201cPick it up quickly, don\u2019t burn the floor.\u201dZhou Xun finally realized, and he tentatively said: \u201cDon\u2019t you tattle to the director team.\u201dThe program team did not allow the trainees to smoke during training, let alone in the training room. In the early hours of the morning, the monitoring will be closed for a period of time. Zhou Xun was a little stressed, so he secretly smokes.Jian Xingsui said softly, \u201cI\u2019m not that boring.\u201dZhou Xun was taken aback for a moment. He saw Jian Xingsui sitting down in front of the computer desk, so he went over and said, \u201cWhy did you come here in the early morning?\u201dJian Xingsui put on his earphones, as he prepared to continue arranging the music. He replied: \u201cThere are only five days left from our deadline. Only by doing a good job in arranging the music can I help you choreograph. I checked during the day, your progress is very slow.\u201dZhou Xun had a bad temper. He didn\u2019t hesitate, sneering, \u201cCan you blame me? There are so many chorus parts in this song, and they are all high-energy. I can only make the choreography complicated, or else I\u2019ll dampen the lyrics!\u201dJian Xingsui said: \u201cI know, that\u2019s why I\u2019m composing the melody as soon as possible.\u201dZhou Xun didn\u2019t expect that Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t make things difficult for him. He wasn\u2019t also annoyed or angry, continuing to focus on making the stage as good as possible. And\u2026 it ended up benefiting Zhou Xun, didn\u2019t it?With a hint of hesitation in his voice, he asked, \u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not helping you, I\u2019m helping myself.\u201d Jian Xingsui replied unexpectedly in a confident tone, \u201cDidn\u2019t Instructor Fu say that we only have one chance to perform on stage? We must grasp the opportunity and not fumble it, no matter how it ends.\u201dZhou Xun choked.Sitting next to Jian Xingsui, he suddenly found that this person didn\u2019t seem to be so troublesome. He didn\u2019t know when Jian Xingsui started\u2026 to become different from what he remembered. Before, whenever Zhou Xun bullied him, Jian Xingsui wouldn\u2019t fight back with this attitude.Zhou Xun thought of \u201cShimmer\u201d, and suddenly his heart moved. He said, \u201cYour song\u2026 do you have an arrangement ready now?\u201dJian Xingsui paused, nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSing it to me.\u201d Zhou Xun tentatively said, \u201cAnyway, there is no one else who can hear it now.\u201dHe was joking, but Jian Xingsui took it seriously.He took off the earphones and picked up his lyrics book again. When he was composing \u201cShimmer\u201d, he already had an inkling of the melody in his heart. So he had no problem humming it out loud smoothly. The young man\u2019s voice was a little deep, but not hoarse; instead it was very crisp with a pure feeling. Just like what Tuya said, Jian Xingsui excelled at infusing emotion into his singing, making it more effectively heart-rendering.Under the light, he lowered his brows and eyes, gentle yet powerful.At the beginning, the gentle singing relieved people\u2019s fatigue. It steadily ramping up, until it swelled out in an emotional climax. Zhou Xun subconsciously stared blankly and immersed in it, and even the song\u2019s choreography movements slowly appeared in his mind. He had a hunch that this song would make a great stage.Jian Xingsui said: \u201cI\u2019m done singing.\u201dZhou Xun didn\u2019t want it to end, so he asked, \u201cAlready?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Jian Xingsui put the lyrics aside, then stopped looking at him and said: \u201cYou smoked a cigarette and it will make your throat feel sore tomorrow. I have always prepared throat lozenges in the drawer, you can eat them.\u201dZhou Xun opened the drawer. Lo and behold, there were really throat lozenges in it. He took a piece into his mouth, the cold sweetness of the mint burst on his tongue.If he thought about it\u2026 if felt like Jian Xingui. It has a hard shell, but if you looked at it closely, you could find a hint of the sweet sugary mint inside, making you feel refreshed.Maybe\u2026 Jian Xingsui was actually a pretty okay guy?The author has something to say:I would like to make a special statement that \u201cShimmer\u201d is not Jian Xingsui\u2019s original creation, it was just designed for the plot.The original singer of \u201cShimmer\u201d (\u5fae\u5149) is Teacher Hua Chenyu (\u534e\u6668\u5b87)If there is any offense, I would like to say sorry to Mr. Hua Chenyu and his fans.1putting himself into a dire situation where he can\u2019t get out easily.2\u6218\u5cf0; Zh\u00e0n f\u0113ng3\u5fae\u5149; W\u00e9i gu\u0101ngPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a fan, he could only do this small thing to share the actor\u2019s problems.Zhou Xun was a little bit emotional: \u201cYou are quite good at taking care of people, why didn\u2019t I see it before\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui laughed at himself: \u201cHow much did you know me before?\u201dZhou Xun was taken aback by this sentence.All along, he has been more sympathetic to Anran. He always thought that Anran was a very pitiful boy \u2013 he was hard-working and pure. In opposition to that, he thought Jian Xingsui was too vicious, always bullying the poor Ranran. Jian Xingsui was way richer than Ranran was, but that fact didn\u2019t stop him from bullying Ranran.But when Jian Xingsui said that suddenly, Zhou Xun finally had an epiphany that he \u201cknew\u201d Jian Xingsui solely from Anran\u2019s mouth. Anran always said that Jian Xingsui bullied him, but in fact he hadn\u2019t actually seen it with his own eyes.Zhou Xun\u2019s mood suddenly became very complicated: \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know you\u2026 very well, yes.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to let his preconceived notions go. If Jian Xingsui wasn\u2019t that bad\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be outrageous for Zhou Xun to be targeting him all the time?If he wasn\u2019t that bad, then why did he help \u201cShimmer\u201d to lose?After this encounter, everything felt\u2026 off. When he read through \u201cPeak of War\u201d again later, he felt that everything he previously thought as normal was wrong. He even felt that if they didn\u2019t perform \u201cShimmer\u201d during the stage, they would lose in the competition with other groups.In the morning, Anran was the first to find out what was wrong with him, and asked in a soft, caring voice, \u201cA-Xun, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dZhou Xun walked beside Anran, and after hearing the words, he tentatively asked, \u201cRanran, be honest with me. Do you think\u2026 Jian Xingsui\u2019s \u2018Shimmer\u2019 was actually pretty good? Even better than \u2018Peak of War\u2019? Because now\u2026 I think that way.\u201dAnran\u2019s smile froze.He replied slowly, \u201cI think it\u2019s very ordinary, not as good as Xu\u2019an-gege\u2019s\u00a0song.\u201dZhou Xun frowned slightly, wondering: \u201cIs that so?\u201dSeeing Zhou Xun like this, Anran was at a loss.He didn\u2019t know when it started, but he found that everything around him was slowly out of his control. Not only many things didn\u2019t get better, but it went\u00a0way\u00a0worse than his previous life.Yes, in fact, this was his second life \u2013 he was reborn.Compared to his first life, he felt that his glorious moments were much less.At his first life\u2014When he returned to Jian Family\u2019s house, he got to know Fu Jinxiao through the things he scraped from Jian Xingsui\u2019s room and study. He slowly but surely knew the actor\u2019s past, achievements, works, and other things. Reading all of that quickly made him attracted to the actor\u2019s excellence. Moreover, thanks to \u201cStarlight\u201d, he could use that information to place himself in front of Actor Fu\u2019s eyes. That was the starting point when his life went smoothly.But later, things changed. He didn\u2019t know how it went wrong exactly, but it seemed that once he took Actor Fu to visit his house and mentioned the then-deceased Jian Xingsui\u2026 things snowballed downhill. He remembered being forced to confess that all of Fu Jinxiao\u2019s memorabilia and knowledge came from Jian Xingsui\u2019s things.After that point, Fu Jinxiao\u2019s attitude towards him dropped down to near sub-zero. Originally, their relationship was very good, and they were just a step away from making things official, but\u2026Fu Jinxiao\u2019s alienation could be said to be the finishing blow to Anran\u2019s comfortable life.His good luck has come to an end. He was met with misfortune after another misfortune. Not to mention his abysmal development of the entertainment industry, in the end he had to marry the son of a wealthy businessman! His previously glamorous popularity crumbled, and he could only live a nobody\u2019s life!But then, the Gods seemed to favor him.He woke up one day, and actually found himself in the past with enough time to correct the trajectory of his life.This time, Anran wanted to be on the offensive to seduce Fu Jinxiao. He needed to win the man\u2019s heart if he wanted to succeed.There were some things in his previous life that still confused him, though. Why did Fu Jinxiao\u2019s attitude towards him change drastically after that forced confession? He still doesn\u2019t have the answer, but his gut instinct told him to make sure Jian Xingsui stayed far, far away from himself and Fu Jinxiao. He subconsciously knew that it would be very dangerous for him otherwise.Therefore, this pest Jian Xingsui must be eliminated.Best if he died early like in his previous life.His thoughts finally came back to the present, Anran sweetly coaxed Zhou Xun, \u201cA-Xun, I think Xu\u2019an-gege\u2019s song is very good, and the other two people think so too. What\u2019s wrong with you? Why did you suddenly start mentioning this?\u201dZhou Xun replied with a sigh, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2026\u201dAnran smiled, trying to change the subject, \u201cYou may be under too much pressure, let\u2019s go to the cafeteria to have breakfast.\u201dZhou Xun said in return, \u201cBut don\u2019t we have to go to the training room early to clean up first? There will be staff to check at 8 o\u2019clock\u2026 which is soon.\u201dAnran had something else on his mind, so he replied without thinking too much, all in a casual tone, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t need to clean up. Jian Xingsui will do it anyway,\u00a0 those things Jian Xingsui will do, as he always did every time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnran was met with a deafening silence.That woke him up from his stupor. He suddenly realized that he might have said something wrong. He looked back, and met with Zhou Xun\u2019s unreadable emotions, pooling on his eyes.Zhou Xun stopped, and looked as if he realized something. He took a deep, tired breath and said, \u201cRanran, I\u2026 I think you are so much different from before.\u201dHearing that, An Ran\u2019s heart tightened.\u201cNone of us here are \u2018supposed\u2019 to clean the room as our primary job, yes, however\u2026 we are expected to share the burden together as a team. So, we\u00a0do\u00a0have to clean it ourselves. We can\u2019t rely on Jian Xingsui every time. It is not fair.\u201dZhou Xun took another deep breath before continuing, \u201cI always thought that\u2026 you didn\u2019t clean it up because you are too tired after practice to do anything else. But it seems that\u2026 you didn\u2019t do it because it\u2019s not something you have to do?\u201dAnran was hit with Zhou Xun\u2019s unusually harsh words, leaving him speechless. But, he still wanted to quibble to defend himself. He cranked up his charm and leaned closer to Zhou Xun, looking pitiful, \u201cA-Xun, you know I didn\u2019t mean that. Please, listen to my explanation first\u2026\u201dIf this was yesterday, Zhou Xun would let Anran plaster himself onto his body.But this time, Zhou Xun took half a step back, putting an extra distance.Anran is more of a malicious idiot than I thought\u2026 deserve thoAlso: congratulations to Zhou Xun for FINALLY being tired of drinking green tea all the time!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But today, the recording started again, to show the audience each groups\u2019 preparation process for their stage.Early in the morning, the trainees all arrived in the training room on time.Li Xu\u2019an was confident, but Anran and Zhou Xun\u2019s complexion were not very good. Honestly, Li Xu\u2019an couldn\u2019t take care to continue polishing up his song anymore \u2013 in the morning, he got up early and went to tidy up his clothing and applied make up. He needed to show the audience his creative talent in order to win more votes.After the cameramen turned on the cameras, several trainees gathered together.All of them have to go through the song selection procedure again, despite having both the song and the captain already been selected. In the end, the audience wanted to see it by themselves, so they had to perform.The group members sat in a circle in the group, but it was Zhou Xun who spoke first: \u201cYesterday you two wrote your own songs, now take them out to vote.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an took out \u201cPeak of War\u201d.Jian Xingsui also put \u201cShimmer\u201d on the table. He knew the result, so he didn\u2019t have any hope.Li Xu\u2019an said confidently: \u201cThen everyone, please take a look at our respective songs, and then we can vote.\u201dIf nothing unexpected happened, the result should be the same as yesterday.Unexpectedly\u2026Zhou Xun looked at it for a while, put down both song\u2019s music scores, and said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell anything just by looking at the lyrics. Can you two introduce your concept when creating these songs?\u201dThe cameraman went over to zoom in to the lyrics.Li Xu\u2019an didn\u2019t expect Zhou Xun to add a scene like this, but he had no choice but to respond quickly and said: \u201cWhen I created \u2018Peak of War\u2019, I wanted our entire team to be invincible and brave. Coming to \u2018Starlight\u2019 is to challenge difficulties together, so we must show fearless courage together.\u201dThe other team members nodded.However, what Li Xu\u2019an said was relatively just a generic concept. It wasn\u2019t touching or ground-breaking.It was Jian Xingsui\u2019s turn, but he didn\u2019t prepare to give a speech like Li Xu\u2019an did. He just picked up his own lyrics and looked at it for a while before saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t think about anything when I wrote \u2018Shimmer\u2019\u201d\u201d \u2026\u201dThe surroundings fell into silence. This youth\u2026 was too out of touch with the routine.\u201cI was just thinking\u2026 When I first came here, there were 108 students, that\u2019s a lot of people, right?.\u201d Jian Xingsui said slowly, as if gathering his thoughts, \u201cAt that time, the director told us that the variety show \u2018Starlight\u2019 was born to let everyone shine their own light.\u201d\u201cBut to the stage, to the audience\u2026 in reality, I am too insignificant. So, I could say that if I were a star, I would be just a shimmering, small star that could only emit a faint light.\u201d Jian Xingsui\u2019s voice was soft, light, and calm. His tone of voice steadily led his group members around him to also calm down and listen to his speech, \u201cBut after experiencing being a small, insignificant star for a long time\u2026 I gradually understand that even if it\u2019s just a glimmer, there will be people who like me, people who cheer for me and give me affirmation.\u201dThe trainees who can stay in the second stage more or less have a certain level of fan base.When they heard this, many people felt uncomfortable. They recalled the first stage, a stage with many twists and turns.\u201cI also feel that, it doesn\u2019t matter how bright of a star I am, even if I am just a small glimmer, I still want to shine for those who support me.\u201d Jian Xingsui smiled softly, \u201d Even though I am insignificant, even though I may become dim in the future, I will never give up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter his speech was finished, there was another silence in the room.These words not only moved the audience a little, but also spoke to the hearts of the contestants \u2013 whoever participated in this survival show could understand what Jian Xingsui wished to express.The audience was also very emotional:[Shimmer\u2019s lyrics are very well written.][I already want to see the final version of the song.][I thought \u2018Peak of War\u2019 is good when I saw it, but now I think it pales in comparison to \u2018Shimmer\u2019.]Zhou Xun sighed in relief as he said, \u201cIn this case, let\u2019s raise our hands to vote.\u201dIn this team, Zhou Xun, Anran and Li Xu\u2019an have a good relationship, while the other two trainees are neutral, so they were more uncertain with their choice. Though\u2026 after practicing \u2018Peak of War\u2019 yesterday, they found that this song has too much of Li Xu\u2019an\u2019s personal style. As if when writing the song, this person really only cared about himself and didn\u2019t care whether it would suit the group\u2019s image. But they don\u2019t want to offend too many people at once, especially the first ranked trainee\u2026\u201dZhou Xun was the first to raise his hand: \u201cI choose \u2018Shimmer\u2019\u201dThe other two neutral parties were stunned, looking at Zhou Xun in surprise. Jian Xingsui was also even more surprised, as obviously he didn\u2019t choose that way yesterday.The smile on Li Xu\u2019an\u2019s face almost fell off..The neutral parties saw that Zhou Xun had taken the lead, so the two of them wouldn\u2019t offend anyone much. But it would be much better if there was one leader, and the two of them looked at each other and got the answer.Zhang Jiajia and Zuo An raised their hands together: \u201cWe also choose \u2018Shimmer\u2019\u201dNow Anran was the only one left.But his choice wouldn\u2019t matter, as it\u2019s already 3:1 already.Anran didn\u2019t expect this to happen. Things were fine yesterday, so why did everything take a turn today? What happened in just one night?Zhou Xun put down his hands: \u201cOkay, then the voting is over.\u201d\u2018Shimmer\u2019 won, and the final decision was made in front of the audience, so it could not be changed.Li Xu\u2019an had already begun to sharpen a knife in his heart, wishing to fight Zhou Xun. But facing the camera, he could only force a smile on his face, and even pretended to smile generously and said, \u201cCongratulations, Suisui.\u201dJian Xingsui held his beloved songbook in his hand, smiling for the depths of his heart, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBoth Anran and Li Xu\u2019an were in a bad mood.For the time being, the turbulent tide hidden among this group was invisible to the audience. Anran glanced at Li Xu\u2019an, then tentatively said, \u201cThen we have to choose a captain, Xu\u2019an-gege\u00a0has experience before\u2026\u201dZhou Xun cut him immediately, \u201cSince we have already chosen \u2018Shimmer\u2019, let Jian Xingsui be the captain.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an vehemently disagreed. Jian Xingsui already took advantage of all the benefits! It\u2019s unfair to him! He forced a polite facade and said, \u201cXingsui, you don\u2019t have any experience in this field, right?\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s doing very well.\u201d Zhou Xun was dissatisfied with Anran, so he dared to tell the truth, \u201cHe was still in the practice room very late last night. He wrote lyrics and arranged music for us, and yet he was the first to arrive every morning in the past two days. He would pack up the tables and chairs here, and help us sign the arrival. Aren\u2019t those a sign of him being a good leader?\u201dZhang Jiajia also agreed on what Zhou Xun said. It made sense.While it\u2019s true that Li Xu\u2019an was the captain, but he could only order people around, while he didn\u2019t share any of the group work. It was a stark contrast to Jian Xingsui, who was friendly and helpful to them.So Zhang Jiajia also said in support, \u201cI also think that Xingsui will be a better captain, and he is also the composer of this song. It would be good if he conducts it.\u201dZuo An nodded, \u201cI agree.\u201dAgain, it immediately became a quick 3:1 vote.Li Xu\u2019an felt a little heartbroken in an instant. He didn\u2019t expect these people to change their faces so quickly compared to yesterday. But there was nothing he could do in front of the camera. He couldn\u2019t be the leader if others didn\u2019t let him, so he had to suppress his resentment with a forced smile: \u201cThen, congratulations once again for Suisui.\u201dTo his surprise, Jian Xingsui, who was elected, didn\u2019t make a speech. Instead, he put down his songbook and said, \u201cI think it\u2019s better to let Xu\u2019an be the captain while I am the vice-captain instead.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an looked at him in shock.\u201cXu\u2019an-ge\u00a0is right. I have no experience in leading a boy group. Although I can write lyrics and compose music, I am really not good at dancing, blocking1, and other things.\u201d Jian Xingsui was neither arrogant nor impatient, he spoke in a quiet dignity, \u201cSo if Xu\u2019an-ge\u00a0becomes the captain, he should be able to play a greater role in my weaknesses than I can.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an was quite critical at first, but he didn\u2019t expect Jian Xingsui to be able to say that in such a frank manner. It created a subtle sense of appreciation inside his heart.Zhou Xun also said, \u201cOkay then, then Xu\u2019an will be the captain.\u201dAnran would not let go of this opportunity to look like an obedient boy in front of the audience, so he quickly raised his hand with a sweet smile, \u201cI agree!\u201dOf course the others also agreed.A crisis that was about to split within the team was actually resolved by Jian Xingsui\u2019s lack of greed. \u2018Shimmer\u2019 was officially finalized as their song. There were only five and a half days left.But alas, their progress wasn\u2019t smooth.Everyone had a different strengths and style, and so they had their own, varyingly differing opinions:\u201cI think adding an extra rap section would be good for the song.\u201d\u201cI feel my personal section is too short, can you add it a little?\u201d\u201cNot enough passion, when we dance it on stage then we\u2019ll appear weak.\u201dOf course, Jian Xingsui also tried to meet everyone\u2019s demands. But, the more anxious he was in changing the song, the harder for him to do it. Especially because of the tight deadline and everyone\u2019s clashing opinions. All of that factored in delaying the progress.With four days left, Jian Xingsui faced the computer alone and felt a splitting headache.Many things were not as simple as he imagined. It seems that taking the initiative to participate in competitions and elections requires a lot more than he imagined.As the night fell, his stomach growled.Jian Xingsui slowly realized that he hadn\u2019t eaten at night. He had been busy revising and polishing the song for so long that he forgot to eat all day. Since the majority of the trainees were already back to their room to rest, the cafeteria should also be closed at this time.He remembered that he had a stash of instant noodles for this kind of emergency.As he was rummaging through boxes and cabinets, the door of the training room opened just a tiny bit. Someone stood at the door, looking at the Headless Chicken Boy in the room.Jian Xingsui paused, turned around, and saw the Movie Emperor Fu leaning against the door.Fu Jinxiao held the registration form in his hand, crossed his slender legs, and leaned lazily against the door. Like a deer in a headlight, Jian Xingsui froze before he managed to stand up and greeted the older man respectfully, \u201cInstructor Fu.\u201dFu Jinxiao responded in a lazy tone, with a slight curl on his lips, \u201cWhat are you doing at this time? Can\u2019t sleep?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m writing lyrics and arranging music.\u201d He spoke as he cradled a cup of instant noodles. The contrast was a bit funny.Fu Jinxiao walked inside and glanced at the instant noodle, \u201cAre you going to eat this at night?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded, \u201cThe cafeteria is closed.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat dinner at the cafeteria then?\u201dJian Xingsui pursed his lips in nervousness. Well, his teammates actually had called him to join them for dinner, but he wasn\u2019t fully aware and kept delaying it until it was too late. Now, they already fell asleep, while he was still here.Fu Jinxiao looked at the cutely-dumb youth in front of him, sighed helplessly in his heart, and said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d1blocking refers to the positioning of all the dancers / formation, so they can all appear in front of the camera in an interesting way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 32.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs he digested what the actor said to him, Jian Xingsui stared at his back and froze for a moment.Fu Jinxiao didn\u2019t turn his head back, instead just directly gave a command, \u201cFollow me.\u201dJian Xingsui finally came to his senses, so he quickly put the instant noodles in his hand on the table. Without thinking too much about Fu Jinxiao\u2019s reasons, he faithfully followed the actor to go eat out tonight.The cafeteria was indeed closed, so it was expected for Fu Jinxiao to not take him there. Instead, he led Jian Xingsui to the outside, where the cultural and sports hall was. Many of the program crew had clocked out from work, some had gone home while the others went outside for dinner. And indeed, not far away from the filming location, many vendors were selling snacks and dinners. The scene was very lively.While the two of them walked out, some of the staff recognized Fu Jinxiao, so they would stop to greet him respectfully.\u201cHello Instructor Fu.\u201d\u201cFu-ge, good evening.\u201d\u201cInstructor Fu took a trainee out for supper.\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded faintly as a greeting. He stopped by a flower bed not far away, looked to the youth at his side and said, \u201cChoose what you want to eat.\u201dJian Xingsui was already hungry, so it didn\u2019t take him long to decide. The moment he smelled the delicious, warm, inviting scent of the nearest food, he immediately went there. It was a fried rice stall with an absolutely divine aroma wafting everywhere. As he went inside, he said to the owner, \u201cTwo bowls of fried rice with eggs, please.\u201dThe stall owner happily smiled at his customer and asked, \u201cDo you want anything extra to add?\u201dJian Xingsui looked at the menu. There were a lot of add-ons available on the stall: meat, intestines, and various vegetables for side dishes. They all looked very appetizing, and it made Jian Xingsui want to add them all. Just as he was going to tell the owner his choice, he suddenly had a realization \u2013 he didn\u2019t bring any money at all!But a voice came from behind, \u201cGive him a little bit of all.\u201dThe actor\u2019s slender and clean hand passed the banknote over him, then handed it to the stall owner. He happily took the money, counted it internally, then immediately started cooking.Jian Xingsui unexpectedly looked at Fu Jinxiao\u2019s hand in a daze. He still remembered that Fu Jinxiao also came to Zhang\u2019s family1\u00a0rice cake shop last summer. That time, he also gave Jian Xingsui a banknote and a band-aid. As he took a trip down his memory lane, he kept staring at Actor\u2019s Fu hand in a subconscious daze.Fu Jinxiao glanced at him: \u201cAre you hungry?\u201dJian Xingsui suddenly came back to his senses, and quickly answered so he wouldn\u2019t look disrespectful, \u201cNo, no, I was thinking about paying back your money when I go back next time, or I can treat you to dinner someday too.\u201dThe stall owner finished cooking and handed over the take-away fried rice to Jian Xingsui.The corner of Fu Jinxiao\u2019s mouth twitched into a faint smile, and he said slowly as he walked back, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not easy to ask me out for dinner.\u201dThis sentence sounds a bit arrogant at first, but after some thinking, Jian Xingsui realized that it was true. He was telling the truth \u2013 in his position as a big-name actor, those rich producers or investors had to scramble in order to arrange a dinner appointment with him.In comparison, Jian Xingsui was just a no-name trainee.Jian Xingsui felt that his braincells must\u2019ve been completely eradicated to say such a stupid thing. In a soft tone, he lowered his head and apologized, \u201cI made a mistake\u2026\u201dBut Fu Jinxiao interrupted his apology as he slowly said, \u201cIf you want to make a dinner appointment with me, you can. However, you will have to wait until you leave this gymnasium. I\u2019ll agree to attend your celebration banquet. I will be waiting.\u201dThe wind at the end of autumn was a bit chilly.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s words were heard clearly, but it made Jian Xingsui\u2019s heart skip a beat. Hearing the word \u201ccelebration banquet\u201dmade his heart very excited at first, but then it fell silent.Ah, yes, he remembered.He wouldn\u2019t \u2013 couldn\u2019t \u2013 be present at the debut celebration banquet. But\u2026 Actor Fu thought he could make it as a debutant of this show.Wasn\u2019t that an affirmation of the highest degree?Just thinking that made Jian Xingsui\u2019s heart jump and burn, beating very loudly in his ribcage.The two of them walked to the pavilion not far away. The air was crisp, and the noise was minimal, as there was no one there. All in all, it was a perfect spot to enjoy a leisurely dinner.Jian Xingsui handed the meal to Fu Jinxiao: \u201cYours.\u201dFu Jinxiao thought that Jian Xingsui bought two portions to eat for himself, so he was surprised that the youth were actually thinking of treating him to dinner. He smiled in response, \u201cThank you.\u201dThe freshly-made egg fried rice was warm and fragrant.Jian Xingsui buried his head in his food, so focused because he was feeling ravenous. As he was demolishing his dinner, he heard Fu Jinxiao talking to him, so he turned his head to face the older man.Fu Jinxiao was eating at a lazy pace, so he hadn\u2019t eaten much. Instead, the actor looked at the youth and asked, \u201cTell me, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dJian Xingsui answered after a pause, clearly confused. He raised his head and asked back, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what do you mean?\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 you haven\u2019t eaten all day, did you? You glued yourself up to the computer from early morning to finish up your song; and after everything went well, you want to celebrate with that cup of noodles for your dinner?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInstructor Fu could be so humorous at times.Jian Xingsui swallowed the food in his mouth, hesitating whether to talk about the problems he had encountered. When he looked up to meet Actor Fu\u2019s eyes, he only saw the older man\u2019s dark and peaceful eyes. Steeling his resolve, he just sat there, quiet and steady, thinking about how to explain his circumstances.Fu Jinxiao wasn\u2019t the type who likes small chit-chat. He\u2019s very efficient with his words. So, there was no need for any extra embellishment, so he should just tell everything as-is. Any extra fluff would be seen as nothing but small winds and waves in front of Fu Jinxiao.Besides, Fu Jinxiao was someone he could trust.Someone who he could confide in.Jian Xingsui remembered Wen Shengge\u2019s words he said as he left, the thing about asking Jian Xingsui to seek other people\u2019s help when he encountered difficult problems.Wen Shengge was right. He was the type who buried all his troubles, not daring asking for any outside help. And he also knew that it wouldn\u2019t solve his problem, and at times, it even ended up worsening them.He promised his ex-roommate that he would be better, and this was the time to fulfill that promise.\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Jian Xingsui took a deep breath, \u201cI have indeed encountered a problem, please help me out.\u201dSitting in the small pavilion, the youth with buzz-cut talked about his troubles, his hand was still gripping his disposable chopsticks. He talked about the song\u2019s arrangement \u2013 about how his teammates have a million differing opinions and it ended up prolonging things out. He knew too many cooks would spoil the broth, but he didn\u2019t know how to reject only some of their opinions without accidentally making it as if he was biased to a certain person.As this was the first time that Jian Xingsui has told everything inside his mind in front of Fu Jinxiao, it ended up removing the last transparent barrier separating the two of them. They no longer felt as a polite teacher and student, but instead more like close friends ranting about their hassle at work.Fu Jinxiao groaned after listening to the youth\u2019s problems, \u201cSo, you stayed and worked overtime by yourself?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded slightly.Fu Jinxiao sneered, full of sarcasm, and commented: \u201cStupid\u201dJian Xingsui was taken aback.Normally, Movie Emperor Fu looked refined and gentle, always with a polite smile. He looked like the kind of gentleman who would never use any swear words. So, when the actor said this word to him, Jian Xingsui was stunned for a moment.Fu Jinxiao opened his mouth, dinner forgotten in favor of lecturing the stupid youth, \u201cWhat is a team?\u201d\u201cA team is the six of you working together to find a way to complete the performance, instead of throwing all the problems to you and waiting for you to solve it.\u201d Fu Jinxiao flicked his gaze to see Jian Xingsui more clearly, \u201cDo you think that others will understand and gladly receive your love if you just accept all of it silently? Wrong, if the response of this stage is not good in the end; not only the audience, but even\u00a0your teammates\u00a0will put all the responsibility on your shoulder.\u201dThese words enlightened Jian Xingsui.Jian Xingsui asked with a lost look, \u201cThen what should I do?\u201dIf Jian Xingsui asked for advice about his problem to the other mentors, they would advise him to think about the overall situation, to cooperate more with his teammates, how to properly discuss with his teammates, or how to fulfill his responsibilities as the team\u2019s vice-captain and composer.But he asked for Fu Jinxiao\u2019s advice. This old fox would never eat such a loss with that kind of soft approach. No, he would think of something that 100% guaranteed to benefit him.The black-bellied actor mused, putting his fingers on his lips, \u201cWhat would I do\u2026\u201dThen, as if he thought of a brilliant plan, Fu Jinxiao\u2019s lips curled into a meaningful smile. He sat lazily on the chair and drawled in an enchanting, yet dangerous tone, \u201cOf course I would\u2026\u00a0discuss\u00a0it with my teammates.\u201dAs the actor said that, the chilly autumn wind blew.Jian Xingsui inexplicably felt embarrassed. A sudden chill went down to his spine.He didn\u2019t know why, but he felt that the word \u201cdiscuss\u201d Fu Jinxiao just said was laced with such a level of spite.As if he actually had murder in mind.first date?

The second stage was about to start the official recording.Jian Xingsui\u2019s team also changed into their costumes in the backstage waiting room. After they finished, all they needed to do now was to wait for their turn to perform. As the only creative team of the second stage this time, they have received a lot of attention.This round, they would face and fight against Shen Xingchen\u2019s team \u2013 a very strong opponent.Shen Xingchen himself had very strong dancing skills, and his personal style was hot and wild. Whenever he performed, he always had all the audience\u2019s attention. This time, he changed his style and abandoned the previous bad-boy look. Instead of black leather jacket, he was clad in a handsome white riding outfit, his image was like a noble prince. With the style change, his whole aura also changed. The new look was an instant hit with the audience. As soon as he came up to the stage, many little girls shrieked in joy and exploded their eardrums.Zhou Xun sighed as he heard the very enthusiastic cheers, \u201cThis kid really has something.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an also took his opponent\u2019s sneaky image change very seriously, \u201cOur opponent this time is very strong. We cannot underestimate them.\u201dJian Xingsui who was sitting next to him gently covered his lips\u00a0 trying to cover the coughing sound.Anran said with a concerned tone,\u00a0 \u201cSuisui, are you okay? You don\u2019t seem to be feeling well during these two days. If you are really uncomfortable, please communicate with the program team. It\u2019s not good if something happens during the filming.\u201dZhou Xun also looked over worriedly.To be honest, Jian Xingsui really gave them a lot of surprises these days, especially when it came to the final song arrangement. The day after his song was selected, Jian Xingsui, the vice-captain, took out an improved song and put it in front of everyone, saying bluntly: \u201cThis is the final version, because we don\u2019t have enough time, so we have to use this.\u201dHow bad was that version, you might ask?Well, anyone with functioning ears would discern it as \u201cnot good\u201d.Just when everyone expressed their bad opinions, at noon of the same day, Jian Xingsui took out another version, and said, \u201cThis is a slightly modified version based on the one I made in the morning. What do you think about it?\u201dAfter comparison, although the version at noon did not meet everyone\u2019s requirements, it unanimously passed.After all, it was miles better than the morning version.Only Zhou Xun knew that the second version of Jian Xingsui\u2019s arrangement was actually prepared a long time ago. Although this was actually a trick Jian Xingsui did to force everyone to choose what he wanted, it actually solved the core issues of the problem. After that, nobody had any more complaints and began to rehearse seriously.However, as the main person in charge of this stage, Jian Xingsui often stayed up all night and that exhausted his body in result. He had a low-grade fever since yesterday, and his situation was worrying.Zhou Xun said, \u201cHave you taken a fever-reducing medicine?\u201d\u201cI took it in the morning.\u201d Jian Xingsui cleared his throat, \u201cCan I take it again? The medicine has side effects, and I\u2019m afraid I might feel sleepy during the stage\u2026\u201d\u2018You have worked very hard for this stage.\u2019This sentence popped up in the hearts of all members of the creative team at the same time.But somehow, Jian Xingsui\u2019s energy level inexplicably boosts their overall morale.They wanted to win this so badly. And they\u00a0must\u00a0win this stage.Instructor Li\u2019s voice came from the front: \u201cNext, let\u2019s invite the creative team to come on stage. The work they brought us is \u2018Shimmer\u2019! Let\u2019s give them a round of applause!\u201dThe audience gave them a warm welcome, as they were very excited:\u201cAh!! It\u2019s \u2018Shimmer\u2019, I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it~\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so excited I don\u2019t know what to doooo.\u201dOn the stage, Jian Xingsui stood, countless spotlights fell on his body, illuminating it in a mysterious glow. He could see the enthusiastic faces of the audience clearly. Not far away from them was the instructor\u2019s seat \u2013 and in the middle was Fu Jinxiao. He set his eyes on the actor, fully knowing that this might be his last stage, so he must fully utilize it. He would show Fu Jinxiao and everyone his absolute best.The low-grade fever makes his head ache, and his body sluggish. The high-intensity dance practice had exhausted all his body strength. Every bit of his muscle was sore, and every inch of his nerve felt fried with dull pain.His limit was to stand still here, but he needed to push through that limit.He had a song to perform.This was the stage for which he has worked hard and devoted his heart; this was his last hope fueling his soul these days.The music played softly in the stereo, the tune of \u201cShimmer\u201d poured out, and his body moved faster than his brain could think. Thanks to the repeated training and continuous rehearsal, he could move on beat.The audience might never know what sacrifices he had to make. But that\u2019s okay, so long they could enjoy his creation at its best.\u201cIn the dark night, are you walking alone?\u201d\u201cIs there someone accompanying you, walking on this lonely road?\u201dLi Xu\u2019an opened the curtain of the performance with an elegant accompaniment. His efforts were slowly presented in front of the audience.\u201cI want to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you.\u201d\u00a0An Ran\u2019s singing voice was gentle and clear, and he sang in a low voice,\u00a0\u201cI am, I am the shimmering joy, circling around you.\u201dThe stage was designed to enhance their performance. The LED screen was now a big, blue starry sky that was slowly rotating. All quiet, poignant, and mesmerizing.Jian Xingsui and Anran changed positions. Jian Xingsui sang as he took the center stage,\u00a0\u201cIn the dark days, I also want to introduce myself to you. I am, I am the sigh you passed by the corner and never looked back.\u201dThe quiet melody enchanted them, immersing them in this hazy, dreamy atmosphere.Jian Xingsui\u2019s voice was much hoarser than before, that much was clear to the audience. But his hoarse voice combined with the lyrics of \u201cShimmer\u201d gave people a sense of strange fusion. It felt strangely fitting, enhancing the performance to the next level.\u201cI am not who I am, who\u00a0I\u00a0am.\u201dJust when everyone thought it was a lyrical song, Jian Xingsui changed positions. Zhou Xun\u2019s voice was high and loud, and his tone instantly changed the whole song. The tranquility was broken, shocking the audience with a refreshing tonal shift.\u201cLook up, and see me burning hot\u201d\u201cLook up, and see the shimmer of light I dedicated to you after I burn everything up.\u201dThe background of the stage suddenly changed from the blue starry sky to a majestic sea of red stars, all shining bright like burning flames. The dry ice turned into mist and enveloped the entire stage. Li Xu\u2019an jumped forward from behind, accompanied by Anran. Their combined duet following Zhou Xun\u2019s high-tone rap raised everyone\u2019s emotions a little higher:\u201cMaybe I am just a shimmering light, but I want to shine it on you.\u201d\u00a0Li Xu\u2019an sang.It was answered by Anran, who sang in a lonely and gentle voice with a touch of sadness,\u00a0\u201cI would rather get myself hurt, get myself hurt. Let me bloom into endless gleams for you.\u201dFrom the lyrical opening, to the rap, the ups and downs emotional beat of the song has successfully captured the audience\u2019s love.The applause and fierce cheers of the fans suddenly broke out from the audience, and the barrage in the live broadcast room also suddenly increased:\u201cAbsolutely, absolutely amazing!\u201d\u201cMy scalp is fucking numb.\u201d\u201cGodly song! Godly performance!\u201dHowever, the surprise brought to them by \u201cShimmer\u201d was far more than that. When the first half of the singing ended and the song entered a turning point, a piece of piano rang perfectly connected the tune. When the three were attracted, the spotlight was turned on again, and it fell on the man behind piano, Jian Xingsui.The tone was high-pitched but melodious. Jian Xingsui\u2019s fingers danced on the keys, skimming ever-so-softly, like a leaping elf. His cheeks were slightly red due to a low-grade fever, and his back was completely covered by cold sweat. However, he wouldn\u2019t let his condition affect his performance. As he continued to play a hauntingly beautiful piano accompaniment, it gave his teammates a stage to show off the choreography \u2013 complex footwork with sharp, knife-like movements, all synchronized within the five of them. Every moment seemed to be a work of art, bringing the audience an endless visual feast.When the piano\u2019s volume gradually dropped, Jian Xingsui lowered his face and started singing again with a magnetic low and hoarse voice,\u00a0\u201cIn this lonely night, are you still walking alone? In all these years, are you still suffering?\u201dJian Xingsui had an irreplaceable singing voice \u2013 he had unparalleled appeal when he sang, his emotions easily infecting everyone who heard it. The atmosphere was brought by him, led around by him. At this moment, he was the king of the stage.He lifted his hands and heavily dropped them. As the high-pitched piano sound rose again, the chorus of his teammates joined in. The voices of everyone in unison accurately reached the ears of the audience, bringing another shock, singing in unison as it resounded throughout the stage:\u201cLook up, and see me burning hot\u201d\u201cLook up, and see the shimmer of light I dedicated to you after I burn everything up.\u201dThe whole stage was once again engulfed by a flamboyant red light, forming a strong visual impact with the dark starry sky background.The long tune and strong emotional mobilization made this stage successfully moved the hearts of the audience. When the lyrics came to an end, the roaring applause and piercing screams from the audience covered the room, signaling the success of the performance. \u201cShimmer\u201d had become a god-level song in one fell swoop. This time, as the vice-captain and the creator, Jian Xingsui showed everyone his unparalleled creative talent and strong musical ability.The young man sitting by the piano had delicate eyebrows and three-dimensional features. Under the dim light, his skin was fair and smooth. He had never worn heavy makeup, so he was naturally not greasy at the moment, giving people a sense of elegance.The audience in the live broadcast bombarded the screen with their comment once again:[Such a fucking strong composing ability.][His creative talent is a rare find.][Mama, I found a treasure~][I finally can clearly see Jian Xingsui\u2019s handsome face.][I\u2019ll see who\u2019s stupid enough to not vote for him today!]When the last music on stage ended, the entire track of \u201cShimmer\u201d was performed. It was clear to everyone that the song was very,\u00a0very\u00a0well-received.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Jian Xingsui, who was sitting by the piano, didn\u2019t get up. His head was so dizzy, even he got double images just by looking at the piano keys. He knew the condition of his own body, so he didn\u2019t dare to stand up, in case he would fall immediately.Instructor Li also noticed something was wrong, and muttered softly to him: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThe lighting director on the stage also noticed the problem and dared not turn on all the lights.The audience also gradually felt that something was wrong:\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Jian Xingsui?\u201d\u201cHey, what\u2019s happening?\u201dThe instructors on the special platform were also worried. Fu Jinxiao looked at the youth sitting by the piano, his eyes narrowed slightly. He slowly picked up the microphone, and whispered, \u201cJian Xingsui.\u201dThe elegant and mellow voice sounded low through the speakers on the stage.When it reached Jian Xingsui\u2019s ears, it lifted his spirit up. His chaotic brain finally cleared up a lot, despite his limbs still being weak. This performance exhausted all his remaining physical strength. Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice made him sober and realized that he\u2019s still on the stage.Couldn\u2019t fall. He couldn\u2019t fall in front of so many people.This was a stage that\u2019s built by everyone. If something goes wrong because of him, everyone\u2019s hard work will be ruined.Jian Xingsui secretly twisted himself. The sharp tang of pain revitalized his brain a lot. Under the watchful eyes of everyone, he stood up slowly. His surrounding teammates seemed to realize something. For a moment, no matter what grievances and hatreds there were in the past, they all solidified their image as a tight-knit team.Zhou Xun walked over first, followed by Zhang Jiajia, Li Xu\u2019an, Zou An, Anran\u2026Everyone leaned against each other and stood together, and officially walked to the center of the stage. The group that just finished their performance could also appear on the stage again at this moment. When Jian Xingsui\u2019s body swayed, someone supported him from behind; and when he looked back, he saw Shen Xingchen\u2019s face.Shen Xingchen silently mouthed to him: \u201cLean on me.\u201dThe creative team was the last team to perform, and Jian Xingsui relied entirely on his last bit of strength to support himself. During this time, there should be a performance review or solo interview by the instructors. However, Fu Jinxiao instead asked, \u201cYou guys created this song together, right?\u201dThe other teammates nodded.Only Zhou Xun said: \u201cThe composer of this song is our vice-captain, Jian Xingsui.\u201dFu Jinxiao set his sights on Jian Xingsui, but he didn\u2019t ask Jian Xingsui any extra questions, just curled his lips and smiled slightly. Just like he once praised him on the first stage, he said in a low voice: \u201cYou did a good job.\u201dJian Xingsui had been supporting himself all the time, and his whole body was very tired. This kind of tiredness came deep from the marrow, but when he heard Fu Jinxiao\u2019s affirmation, his heart was hot again. It was enough to re-invigorated his soul, making him gain another bit of strength to continue onwards. Just like in the past, in those dark and difficult years, his idol gave him spiritual persistence. His idol was a gleam of light that kept the fire of his spirit going.Jian Xingsui\u2019s voice was a little hoarse and his eyes were a little red because of a low-grade fever, but he still insisted on speaking: \u201cThank you, Instructor Fu.\u201dOn the stage, the young man solemnly bowed to the instructor\u2019s seat. He gave gratitude and respect to his mentor who appreciated him and gave him a chance.Instructor Tuya said with a slight smile, \u201cOkay, now that the last group has finished its performance, let\u2019s vote for the \u2018Popular King\u2019! Live audience and viewers who watched for 60 minutes or more in the live broadcast will be eligible to vote!\u201dThe big screen at the back of the stage flickered on, and the data of each team was clearly displayed.Jian Xingsui turned around and saw the list of the creative team. As the number of votes on the screen increased little by little, there were three people in the creative group with the highest number of votes: Li Xu\u2019an, Anran, and Jian Xingsui.At the beginning, Li Xu\u2019an and Anran had a high number of votes, while Jian Xingsui was lagging behind. However, slowly but surely, his votes gradually catch up to others. The amazing performance of \u201cShimmer\u201d made him more well-known to all the viewers.And finally, after the viewer voted. Jian Xingsui\u2019s total vote count was far ahead of everyone.This was a stage where public opinion won over money.Tuya announced with a smile, \u201cIn this second stage performance, the \u2018Popularity King\u2019 is\u2014 Jian Xingsui! Congratulations!!\u201dThunderous applause erupted in the arena, and the spotlights fell on the young man, who was currently dazed and confused. As he stood, he gave a shallow, tired smile when he saw his name and face appear on the big screen.Normally, he would\u2019ve needed to give a speech.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s gaze was always fixed on Jian Xingsui. He knew of the youth\u2019s current condition, so he instead said. \u201cPlease stand in the middle of the stage and take a group photo.\u201dShen Xingchen was the first one to walk to the center. His hand was still supporting Jian Xingsui, who still leaned on him.Ning Ze, who was from another team, also came over and supported Jian Xingsui from the other side. the two of them seemed to be Jian Xingsui\u2019s close friends, supporting like good brothers should.Shen Xingchen said in a strange tone: \u201cWhy are you so heavy, brother1it\u2019s \u5144\u5f1f \u201cxiongdi\u201d which does not denotes seniority.?\u201dJian Xingsui said helplessly, \u201cWho is heavy?\u201d\u201cYou are, duh\u2026\u201dThe photographer in front shouted: \u201cPlease look at the camera! \u201cJust as they were bickering, everyone turned their heads to look at the photographer, leaving behind a somewhat funny picture. Jian Xingsui was sandwiched between his two friends. This funny photo was taken, and even the director of the program group didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry when he saw it.However\u2026Nobody expected that many years in the future, when the three young men in the picture had made many achievements in their respective fields, when they gained prestige and influence in the entertainment circle; this photo became a popular topic to discuss by everyone.And every time someone mentioned this, the three young men would take another group photo with relish in their heart.At eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, the recording of the second stage of \u201cStarlight\u201d ended.In the hospital nearest to the shooting location,\u00a0 a doctor was in a hurry in the middle of the night. The young man lying on the hospital bed was unconscious, and an IV drip had to be prescribed. After carefully measuring his temperature, the doctor said, \u201cThe fever should subside in two hours.\u201dThe man sitting opposite the sleeping youth nodded, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d The doctor inwardly blushed when she saw the man\u2019s face, but she was a professional who knew how to abide by medical ethics, so she kept a straight face and continued, \u201cAfter we conducted a physical examination, we found that he is actually a little anemic and physically weak. It should be due to excessive fatigue. His food intake also should be monitored further, as it may be the root cause of his ailments. As for his low-grade fever, it should be a combination of the aforementioned fatigue and mental stress. Let him rest and make sure he is far away from a high-pressure environment until he is completely recovered. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid it will worsen his situation.\u201dFu Jinxiao sat on the hospital chair, sneaked a glance at the boy on the bed, and narrowed his eyes slightly.This youth usually looks indifferent, but there are actually so many worries in his heart? Looking away, Fu Jinxiao nodded to the doctor: \u201cUnderstood, thank you, doctor.\u201dThe doctor\u2019s face flushed red.She finally knows why the outside world had such a high opinion of Fu Jinxiao. Unlike those famous \u201ccelebrities\u201d, Actor Fu was really polite and personable, and he looked very handsome!The doctor hesitated for a bit, but she succumbed to her desires, \u201cWell, uhm\u2026 can I ask you for an autograph? It\u2019s for my colleague, she likes you very much.\u201dFu Jinxiao looked up at her with a distant and polite smile, \u201cYes, but you please wait a minute, I\u2019m taking this child to see a doctor, so he needs to rest.\u201dOnly then did the doctor come to her senses, bowed apologetically, and left quickly.The room fell into silence, and the smell of medicine permeated the room. Jian Xingsui\u2019s sleep didn\u2019t take long. As soon as the sleeping drug started to lose its effect, he slowly woke up. His head still felt like it\u2019s stuffed with cotton, foggy and heavy. He turned his aching head, and saw Fu Jinxiao who sat on a chair by the bedside. He hesitantly asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cInstructor Fu?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t be dreaming, could he?Fu Jinxiao raised his head when he heard a movement, then answered the youth, \u201cAre you awake?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Jian Xingsui noticed the needle in his hand: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me\u2026?\u201dFu Jinxiao succinctly summarized his condition, \u201cYou passed out as soon as you got off the stage and successfully scared the other trainees half to death. As your mentor, it\u2019s my responsibility to take you to the hospital.\u201dJian Xingsui digested the explanation slowly. He then nodded, and said in a serious tone, \u201cThank you, Instructor Fu.\u201dHis fever has subsided a little, making his face not so red, although he was still sickly pale. Sick people were more fragile, after all. Remembering the doctor\u2019s reminder, Fu Jinxiao then finally noticed that this youth seemed too thin for his stature. Didn\u2019t the doctor said that mental stress might be the leading cause of the youth\u2019s ailments?Looking at the well-behaved boy on the bed, Fu Jinxiao suddenly remembered what he overheard in the stairwell that day.It might be because there\u2019s only the two of them, or because the sick youth looked very pitiful, or because the hard-working youth really touched Actor Fu\u2019s heart\u2026 or any combination of those reasons, that led him to ask, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you agree to that one million yuan offer?\u201dJian Xingsui froze.Fu Jinxiao opened his lips: \u201cThat day, I was in the smoking room next to the stairwell, and I overheard it.\u201dJian Xingsui just woke up, his head was still a mess due to his low-grade fever. In this muddled state, he could only say, \u201cYou knew.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Fu Jinxiao said, \u201cYou said you were short of money during the first stage, and you said that your reason for participating was for that 20,000 yuan compensation, right?\u201dActually, the answer to this matter was not that important to Actor Fu.He has always been cold-hearted and indifferent. He has seen everything on this muddy entertainment circle \u2013 many back-door, unfair deals. Normally, he was too lazy to care about it, and besides, he didn\u2019t want to meddle in others\u2019 affairs.This industry was like that \u2013 if you are too good on others, they will chew you until your bones are left. Soft people had no place in this place. But\u2026 somehow, he didn\u2019t know why, he paid an unusual amount of attention to this young man. He still didn\u2019t understand his own reason why, so he asked Jian Xingsui this question.Jian Xingsui sat on the bed, clutching the quilt tightly. He felt that his answer to this particular question was very important. If he didn\u2019t tell the truth, he might never have a chance to say it again, and he would regret it. \u201cBecause\u2026 during the first stage\u2019s ranking announcement, I promised you that I would no longer continue on this show because of the consolation money, as it would be disrespectful of me to think that way.\u201dHearing the answer, Actor Fu was left speechless.Sitting still on the chair, he glanced at the dark sky from the window, his pitch-black eyes reflected the starry night sky. It was rare for him to be completely honest in his expression, no longer using a polite facade\u00a0when facing others.Fu Jinxiao closed his eyes, then asked the youth another question, \u201cIs my words\u2026 that important to you?\u201d\u2018More than that one million yuan? When you\u2019re in desperate need of money?\u2019\u2014was left unsaid.Despite will not, will never be able to debut on the show? Despite saying \u201cno\u201d meant offending the higher-ups?The solemn youth closed his moist eyes, trying to calm his unsteady breaths. The pale fingers shook as it curled on the quilt.He was nervous. Always have since birth, probably. His nature was timid, and before his rebirth, his temper only ever flared when he craved for his \u201cfamily\u2019s\u201d attention. This nature of his was only compounded further when he knew what an insignificant being he was in face of the protagonist. He knew his fate. He knew how he would die because of that fate.But at this moment \u2013 maybe because of the uncontrollable longing and insatiable desire in his heart, or maybe it was because of his actual fever \u2013 he just blurted out what he had inside his mind.In front of Fu Jinxiao, Jian Xingsui nodded gently in answer to the actor\u2019s question.\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2018It is more important.\u20191it\u2019s \u5144\u5f1f \u201cxiongdi\u201d which does not denotes seniority.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As promised, I\u2019ll do a three chapters update for today~Jian Xingsui has never thought that life could be so dreamy.He was lying on the hospital bed, recalling in his mind the conversation with Actor Fu not long ago during his stay in the hospital. After Jian Xingsui nodded, Actor Fu was silent for a while. The silence suffocated the youth in suspense, and just as he was thinking about clarifying his answer, Fu Jinxiao instead asked him:\u201cWhen will your contract with the agency expire?\u201dJian Xingsui was dumbfounded: \u201cHuh?\u201dAfter that, Actor Fu left, but before leaving him with one sentence, \u201cIf your contract expires, or if you want to terminate it in advance, come and discuss it with me.\u201dAgain, Jian Xingsui was left dumbfounded. This time, he was finally alone.He was still riddled with fever, so he couldn\u2019t think clearly. After muddling drowsily on his bed for a while, he gave up trying to parse through Fu Jinxiao\u2019s cryptic words and fell asleep once again thanks to his medication.When he woke up after that, a staff member of the program team called Xiao Mi1it should be \u201cLittle Mi\u201d but it looked awkward as a name\u2026, took care of him and said, \u201cFu-ge has something to do at the moment, he is busy with other jobs, and he flew overnight last night, so I will take care of you in his stead.\u201dJian Xingsui was very grateful: \u201cThank you, I have troubled you.\u201dXiao Mi sighed and said: \u201cNo need to thank me. Anyway, we are friends who have worked together or\u2026 since you are popular now, I guess we aren\u2019t friends anymore\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui shook his head quickly: \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not.\u201dXiao Mi was his partner Jian Xingsui had worked with during his stunt as a temporary helper for this show. During that time, he needed to work to make a living, plus he really didn\u2019t want to live in the Zhang family\u2019s house.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Jian Xingsui hesitated, \u201cAm I really popular?\u201dWhen Xiao Mi heard that, he was delighted to tell Jian Xingsui the truth, \u201cYou are so popular, especially yesterday, you were the most popular person voted by the audience. You know who fickle they are, and yet, you still won the \u2018Popularity King\u2019 vote against everyone!\u201dJian Xingsui was still doubtful, \u201cTrue or not.\u201dXiao Mi pinched his waist and said, \u201cWhat would I lie to you about this?\u201dBut then, Xiao Mi remembered about the show\u2019s rule about not allowing the trainees access to their mobile phones, and so he understood Jian Xingsui\u2019s line of thought. There\u2019s no camera in the hospital, so he dared to sneakily give the youth his mobile phone. He opened the Weibo app as he whispered conspiratorially, \u201cI gave it to you because we are friends, so don\u2019t tell others.\u201dJian Xingsui looked at the mobile phone, a little excited: \u201cI know, thank you Xiao Mi.\u201dXiaomi smiled and went out to let Jian Xingsui watch it by himself.As he laid on the hospital bed, he scrolled down lazily. He tentatively searched for his name, and found that there were several hot discussions currently trending. The most popular discussion was about \u201cShimmer\u201d, thanks to a hot recommended video of yesterday\u2019s performance. Under his solo-cam2a video where the cameraman solely focused on him (other members wasn\u2019t on focus at all) during the performance. video, there were many enthusiastic comments from fans:[Hurry hurry hurry! Put \u201cShimmer\u201d on online music platforms already! Let me put the song on repeat!!][Hey it seems that I broke the replay button :3c][When can I buy buy buy3the repeat isn\u2019t a typo btw. this music already?? I wanna buy the album!]There were also analysis comments on Weibo, such as:[Before, Instructor Tuya and others said that Suisui\u2019s singing style is very emotional, but I never liked it. I always thought that so long his technique is sub-par, he shouldn\u2019t be praised to that extent. However, now I understand the praise. Yesterday, when I heard his \u201cShimmer\u201d performance, I felt like he personally spoke to me. It was heartrending, especially the \u2018maybe I am just a shimmering light, but I want to shine it on you.\u2019 part. Thank you, Suisui, for being the one who illuminates me that day, and now, I want to be the shimmering light that shines the spotlight you deserve.]In reality, most people in this world were ordinary citizens. That\u2019s why, they really liked it when Jian Xingsui said that these ordinary shimmer of light could illuminate others too.You didn\u2019t need to be a \u201cspecial\u201d existence to mean something.On top of that, his singing voice was very emotionally infectious.When normal people sing about how cool and sunny they are, the listener could only nod along. However, when the singer was Jian Xingsui instead, he could make the listener feel like Jian Xingsui was the one who brought the sunshine to them.It was so easy to be moved by such quality.Under that Weibo, there were many comments agreeing with the OP:[Finally, someone who speaks out my heart!][This little cutie really gripped my heart.][I hope he can make his debut.][Suisui must win!]Jian Xingsui saw a lot of support for him from so many people. It warmed up his heart. He still couldn\u2019t believe he got the third ranking, and he was under a lot of pressure recently. It made him very afraid he would disappoint his loyal supporters. After all, the higher the expectation, the higher the fall \u2013 the moment he let his fans down, he would instantly become his staunch anti-fans.Slowly, Jian Xingsui scrolled through, and suddenly came across a different hot topic, who was called #TeacherStudent. Under the topic, it was filled with screenshots and videos about Fu Jinxiao and Jian Xingsui. There was a video where Fu Jinxiao patiently guided him in the practice room, there were photos of the two of them during the battle royale game, and even daily eye contacts between the two of them.He never thought that someone took screenshots of those kind of interaction\u2026Thanks to the framing of the posts, it looked like there were invisible pink bubbles of love between the two men. It was dyed with the color of affection, and it looked like a sweet romance story.The following comments were also filled with screamings:[Teacher and student!! Teacher and student!!!][The little white rabbit wanders around behind the big bad wolf~][Every move is so sweet.][Teacher Fu and Student Jian S! Z! D!4szd = it is real]Jian Xingsui read the comments, and his eyes stained with mirth, lips curling into a smile,\u00a0 \u201cReally\u2026\u201dLooking at these photos on the phone screen, he couldn\u2019t put it down. As he was looking at it, Xiao Mi from outside came back, bringing a doctor alongside him, \u201cSuisui, it\u2019s time to change your saline drip.\u201dJian Xingsui was startled, and the phone almost dropped.Seeing that, Xiao Mi hurried over to his side. Then, he saw the photos on the phone.Now that Xiao Mi had seen what Jian Xingsui had stared, he was ashamed. He wanted to be buried inside the crust of the Earth. But Xiao Mi only showed a very understanding smile to him, and waited for the doctor to leave before saying: \u201cI understand, I know everything.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s earlobe slowly turned red: \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d\u201cWho would be unhappy to catch up with Fu-ge\u2018s popularity?\u201d Xiao Mi said with a smile: \u201cIf I did that, I too, would look at it with a loving gaze.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s fierce heart slowly sank.Under Xiao Mi\u2019s puzzled eyes, Jian Xingsui said softly: \u201cIt\u2019s not because of that\u2026\u201dXiao Mi didn\u2019t hear clearly: \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dJian Xingsui shook his head slowly: \u201cNo. Nothing\u201dThat messy thought\u2026 well, it\u2019s best to let it rot inside his stomach for the rest of his life. Nobody should ever know. In fact, this was already very good \u2013 this might be the best ending possible between them.The next day\u2014Jian Xingsui recovered from his illness and returned to the show.After the end of the second stage, the program team also let the contestants rest for a while. After Jian Xingsui came back, he also heard some rumors that for this voting, the show would eliminate half of the remaining people this time \u2013 so, only top 24 ranking would remain. And for the third stage, there were only 3 groups that would fight each other. And this time, there would be guest celebrity to help out in the performance.Among them is Anran\u2019s second brother, Jian Zhi.Shen Xingchen complained to him, \u201cI heard that Jian Zhi will come here early today. He said it\u2019s for\u2026 uh\u2026. I think it\u2019s for celebrating Anran\u2019s birthday!\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s body froze.Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t notice that, and impatiently continued his rant, \u201cIt\u2019s really hypocritical, and the program team even planned a special event for that! Because of the brotherly relationship between Jian Zhi and Anran, we need to give Anran more shots to please the Jian Royal Family5this was 100% sarcastic, especially since Mr. Jian invested a lot of money to shoot this episode of the program. And then, because of Jian Family\u2019s request, they will hold a special birthday party, and all contestants need to participate\u2026 ugh, so disgusting.\u201dFeeling refreshed after ranting his heart out, he then realized the person beside him was eerily quiet. He then turned around and asked, \u201cSuisui?\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s face was a little ugly. After being asked like this, he pulled his face away and smiled, slowly shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dIf Shen Xingchen hadn\u2019t said this, he would have already forgotten that it will be his birthday in a few days. The same exact day as Anran\u2019s birthday.It has been several years since he celebrated his birthday. Usually, the Jian Family would be too busy to give it a proper celebration. His father would say he was busy with the company or there was a business trip. His eldest brother would say he had a meeting with clients and couldn\u2019t come back. His second brother would say he had a gig scheduled and would only send a birthday message to him.Everyone was\u2026 always busy.At some point, his family just\u2026 stopped celebrating his birthday altogether. In the past, he thought that there was genuinely no time for a celebration. But now\u2026 it seemed\u2026 his family just\u2026 didn\u2019t want to celebrate his birthdays.If they really loved him, they would specially carved a time despite their busy schedule. After all, birthdays are fixed on a date each year \u2013 it\u2019s not hard to allocate this time and clear their schedule if they just tried.Maybe the sadness in his eyes was too obvious; Shen Xingchen softly asked him, \u201cYou don\u2019t like the program group\u2019s promotion of the royal family, do you?Jian Xingsui froze, came back to his senses and nodded haphazardly.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Shen Xingchen patted him on the shoulder with an air of contentment: \u201cWell, there\u2019s no other way, the world is unfair like that. Not everyone can be like me, powerful and rich!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui was shocked by his buddy\u2019s self-confidence.1it should be \u201cLittle Mi\u201d but it looked awkward as a name\u20262a video where the cameraman solely focused on him (other members wasn\u2019t on focus at all) during the performance.3the repeat isn\u2019t a typo btw.4szd = it is real5this was 100% sarcasticPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After asking around, they found out Jian Zhi had come here in advance for a special program. For them, Jian Zhi was a relatively big senior, and a popular one at that. He was someone that many people wanted to befriend to benefit them.As Jian Zhi walked into the cafeteria, he was greeted with warm cheers and enthusiasm.Many trainees became sycophantic and said, \u201cJian-ge, I\u2019ve heard many of your songs before. They are all so good!\u201dThere were many sweet voices calling out to him as Jian Zhi stood beside Anran. To tell the truth, Jian Zhi didn\u2019t want to be as low-key as Fu Jinxiao, and he would fulfill these trainees\u2019 requests to appear nice in front of the camera. He also didn\u2019t dress casually, instead wearing a black suit with a slender, sleek tie. His hair was styled to perfection, not a single strand strayed. He looked immaculate.Jian Zhi smiled and said to everyone: \u201cThis time, I just want to cooperate with everyone for the stage performance, so don\u2019t be too restrained, just treat me as a friend.\u201dThe trainees replied, feeling touched, \u201cJian-ge is really kind\u201d\u201cHe may be famous, but he\u2019s so down-to-earth!\u201dOnly Jian Xingsui knows that Jian Zhi was actually a very stinky person. If he really meant what he said about befriending the trainees, he wouldn\u2019t be dressed in a such fancy suit. He wasn\u2019t low-key at all, and he certainly wasn\u2019t a down-to-earth, humble person. When Jian Xingsui brought his friend to the Jian Family\u2019s house, he was scolded by Jian Zhi, the older man fussing about not wanting Jian Xingsui to tell everyone their brotherly connection.When many trainees saw Jian Zhi coming, they warmly greeted him and wanted to say hello. Jian Zhi glanced across the lobby and found that only Jian Xingsui and Shen Xingchen who were sitting in the corner ignored him. His expression immediately changed, and he deliberately took Anran\u2019s hand and raised his voice, \u201cThis time, I\u2019m here mainly to help my younger brother. Anran usually causes trouble for everyone, so I\u2019ll ask for forgiveness on his behalf.\u201dAnran liked being protected by his famous brother like this, and he immediately smiled shyly.The other trainees hurriedly said: \u201cJian-ge, you are really polite, Ranran is very nice, you don\u2019t need to apologize to us.\u201dAnran clearly enjoyed everyone\u2019s envious gaze towards him, but he was good enough in acting shy.Some trainees plucked up their courage to ask for autographs, to which Jian Zhi agreed. So many people gathered around to ask for autographs and even WeChat contact, but for some reason, Jian Zhi looked at the other side of the cafeteria with some concern.On the other side of the room, Jian Xingsui not only didn\u2019t pay any shred of attention to him, but he and Shen Xingchen straight up went over to get their meal, as if they were too bored and just decided to continue their meal.It was a very subtle and strange feeling. In the past, Jian Xingsui always regarded Jian Zhi as the whole world. No matter the occasion, wherever Jian Zhi appeared, Jian Xingsui would follow him around and couldn\u2019t be shaken off. He used to be so clingy, and that pissed Jian Zhi off. He always thought Jian Xingsui was just a useless younger brother who could only cling to their family\u2019s good name.On the way here, he watched the latest performance, of course not for Jian Xingsui, but just to see Anran. The Internet was praising Jian Xingsui\u2019s superb composition ability, but he sneered at it. However, he was really attracted to \u201cShimmer\u201d. Looking at the shining performers on the stage, Jian Zhi suddenly felt that\u2026 he didn\u2019t know this youth anymore.Was this really Jian Xingsui?His worthless brother?Since when did he compose songs? He never knew that.With a somewhat doubtful mind, Jian Zhi came to the gymnasium ahead of time. He guessed that Jian Xingsui should have known the news that he would not debut. After seeing him coming, Jian Zhi thought he might come over to lick his face1another synonym would be \u201clicking dog\u201d. Describes someone sycophantic. like before, or begging him to help fend off the program\u2019s crew not to eliminate him. Jian Zhi had already thought about how to refuse such disgusting requests.But\u2026Anran poked Jian Zhi: \u201cGe, what are you looking at?\u201dJian Zhi recovered from his thoughts, and said with a guilty conscience: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201dAnran\u2019s smile was a little forced : \u201cReally?\u201dHe\u2019s lying.He was obviously looking at Jian Xingsui.Anran felt a little unhappy in his heart, but still smiled gently, \u201cGe, shall we go to eat too?\u201dJian Zhi nodded.Anran just saw Jian Zhi staring at Jian Xingsui just now. He felt unhappy \u2013 he lost2clarity: Anran lost compared to Jian Xingsui because Jian Xingsui is the Popularity King. to Jian Xingsui at the latest performance, so he thought of getting some of his dignity back by deliberately dragging Jian Zhi to show off. He sat opposite of Jian Xingsui, and he even bought shrimps for his meal. When he was at home, his second brother would peel the shrimps for him.After they sat down, Anran said softly: \u201cSecond brother, do you like shrimp? May I peel them for you?\u201dJian Zhi didn\u2019t really like shrimps, but he still said: \u201cNo, Ranran, I know you like it. Just eat, second brother will peel it for you.\u201dAnran showed a shy smile: \u201cHow embarrassing.\u201dJian Zhi gently patted his head: \u201cYou are my younger brother, why are you being polite to me?\u201dAs if deliberately trying to attract Jian Xingsui\u2019s attention Jian Zhi also acted like a caring big brother, treating his younger brother with gentleness and consideration. This made other trainees envious, and Jian Xingsui also noticed. Although he no longer cared about such things for a long time now\u2026 remembering how different Jian Zhi treated him\u2026 Jian Xingsui\u2019s heart still felt dull and sore.Shen Xingchen next to him hated this nasty scene the most.The haughty Young Master Shen put down his chopsticks: \u201cI\u2019ll get some shrimp too.\u201dAfter returning with a plate of shrimp, Shen Xingchen sat down, acted coquettish, hugged Jian Xingsui\u2019s arm as if deliberately disgusting the other side and said: \u201cCome on, second brother, do you like to eat shrimp? Ge will peel it for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui was dumbfounded by him.After taking the shrimp from Shen Xingchen\u2019s hand, Jian Xingsui said softly: \u201cNo need, I don\u2019t like to eat it very much, and you don\u2019t touch it too much, you are allergic to seafood.\u201dShen Xingchen, a fool, was puzzled: \u201cHow do you know? \u201cJian Xingsui said helplessly: \u201cBecause you didn\u2019t touch any seafood when you ate hot pot last time, and besides, didn\u2019t you said you couldn\u2019t eat it?\u201dShen Xingchen curled his lips into a shy smile and put down the shrimp helplessly.Jian Xingsui saw his shriveled appearance, and gave him a chicken leg from his own bowl: \u201cEat this instead.\u201dShen Xingchen angrily took the chicken leg back, thought for a while, and then gave him the chicken leg in his own bowl, \u201cSecond brother, since shrimps can\u2019t be touched, we will settle on chicken legs.\u201dJian Xingsui was dumbfounded by his nonsensical behavior, but his previous depression was also swept away, and a smile appeared on his eyebrows and eyes.On the opposite side, Jian Zhi was inexplicably lost in thought.He never told Jian Xingsui that he hated shrimps, but when eating, Jian Xingsui never let him eat shrimps. Every time he went home, the dishes on the table\u2026 were also almost all of his favorite dishes. Jian Xingsui sometimes cautiously said, \u201cSecond brother, I made this, it\u2019s a bit mushy, but the taste should be good\u2026\u201dAt that time, he only thought that his younger brother was a clumsy idiot, only knowing how to make trouble.Anran was good at cooking, so he was moved by Anran\u2019s carefully prepared dishes, but he would never be moved by Jian Xingsui\u2019s clumsiness. From the beginning to the end, there has never been a moment when he gave this clumsy younger brother a chance to shine.Anran said from the side: \u201cSecond brother, I peeled the shrimp for you.\u201dHis gentle voice was still as sensible as ever.Jian Zhi recovered, but felt a little uncomfortable in his heart. In the past, he would feel that Anran was caring, but now he didn\u2019t have such thoughts. He just said lightly: \u201cNo need, I don\u2019t have appetite now.\u201dThe smile on Anran\u2019s face suddenly froze.Holding the chopsticks in disbelief, he looked at his second brother who suddenly turned cold towards him for some reason. He was filled with endless doubts \u2013 why, what was wrong? It was fine before, right?In order to prepare for the shooting of Anran\u2019s birthday party, many trainees were decorating the cafeteria in a festive atmosphere. The program\u2019s crew also purchased cakes and other things.After returning to the training room, Jian Xingsui was a little tired, so he took the lead in going to the bathroom to take a shower.Although Shen Xingchen was usually careless, today he also felt that something was wrong. He pulled Ning Ze and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that Comrade Little Jian is not right today?\u201dNing Ze usually doesn\u2019t talk much. After a while, he nodded.\u201cWhy?\u201d Shen Xingchen asked stupidly, \u201cIs he still sick?\u201dNing Ze was silent for a moment, and finally opened his lips and said, \u201cProbably not, I think it might be because it\u2019s his birthday in two days.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dShen Xingchen almost jumped three feet high: \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dNing Ze still looked calm: \u201cI guess it should be because of this.\u201dShen Xingchen asked: \u201cHow did you guess?\u201d\u201cWhen we first came here to register our information, I was the one behind him. I glanced at the identity information he filled in at that time. Because it was a fairly close date, just about two months, I remembered it.\u201d Ning Ze said calmly, \u201cIt should be on the same day as Anran\u2019s birthday.\u201dShen Xingchen was shocked: \u201cThen why didn\u2019t this kid say anything?\u201dNing Ze sat down beside him: \u201cI think it\u2019s because of embarrassment, after all, other people belong to the royal family and have capital, plus it\u2019s a show invested by his father, so he can celebrate his birthday blatantly and give him special attention. If he said that today is also his birthday, wouldn\u2019t that be embarrassing?\u201dIn fact, this mentality was understandable.Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t understand: \u201cBirthdays can\u2019t be not celebrated, it happens only once a year!\u201dIn the Shen family, every birthday was celebrated grandly, and he would receive many gifts. That\u2019s why he always looked forward to it. In his mind, someone\u2019s birthday was a very special day and it must not be ignored. But\u2026 Jian Xingsui\u2019s birthday\u2026 was ignored?The most important thing is that the program crew actually didn\u2019t mention it, just so that there was only Anran as the protagonist of that day. This was deceiving people too much, and Shen Xingchen, the envoy of justice, was not happy.Ning Ze said: \u201cThere is no way\u2026 Where are you going?\u201dShen Xingchen wandered out of the dormitory. Those who have good conditions at home like them will hide their back-up mobile phones. They usually don\u2019t dare to play for fear of being caught. It was a special situation, so he still had the courage to use the phone.He had to buy his second brother a birthday present.He had to ask his family to bring a cake, preferably a bigger one than Anran\u2019s.Shen Xingchen called his elder brother first, but it turned out that he couldn\u2019t get through. Thinking about it, it might be because he was on a business trip or a meeting, so it was understandable. He could only call home. After dialing for a while, a gentle female voice answered \u2013 it was his mother, Xu Enzhen.Shen Xingchen yelled: \u201cMom, you haven\u2019t slept despite being so late?\u201dToday was a cloudy, rainy day. The torrential downpour was loud enough to be heard over the phone.Xu Enzhen replied, \u201cI\u2019m about to sleep, why? Is everything alright?\u201dShen Xingchen was a little worried: \u201cIs Dad at home?\u201dXu Enzhen nodded: \u201cHe is, don\u2019t worry.\u201dOnly then did Shen Xingchen heave a sigh of relief. Speaking of it, this was considered a taboo in the Shen family. The reason was almost twenty years ago, Mrs. Xu was also frightened by the heavy rain at night when her youngest son was born \u2013 and that same day, that child also died. Since then, every rainy day, especially when there was thunder, Mrs. Xu always had nightmares and couldn\u2019t sleep all night. She said that she would dream of the child when she fell asleep, and she would cry even more when she woke up.Xu Enzhen asked softly: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Chenchen?\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Shen Xingchen said, \u201cMom, do you know Jian Xingsui? Two days from now, it\u2019s his birthday, and I want to prepare a birthday present for him. But I\u2019m here for closed training, you know, so I can\u2019t prepare. I\u2019ve inquired before, Jian Xingsui\u2019s parents don\u2019t love him very much, and then the program crew pretended to not know of his birthday, so I thought\u2026\u201dHis mother was suddenly silent.The year when the accident happened, Shen Xingchen was only three or four years old, and he didn\u2019t remember anything. Later, because Mrs. Xu suffered from postpartum depression and mental problems, it was strictly forbidden to discuss that matter at home, so Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t know the exact death date of the younger brother he never had.The thunderclap roared, as loud as an explosion. It roared and echoed inside Xu Enzhen\u2019s ribcage, making her heart pound in an erratic fashion. Her body tensed up, and she failed to fully understand what her son was saying.Shen Xingchen suddenly had a bad premonition, and hesitated, \u201cMom?\u201dIn the Shen Family\u2019s house, the woman sitting on the sofa was completely stiff. Her beautiful face showed sadness, her body trembled uncontrollably, and finally, two lines of tears fell. She covered her lips, trying to stifle her sobs. Finally, amidst her shaky voice, she said,\u00a0 \u201cIs it the day after tomorrow? Is that child\u2019s birthday really the day after tomorrow?\u201dShen Xingchen didn\u2019t know why her mother suddenly behaved like this, so he could only nod honestly: \u201cYes, yes it\u2019s the day after tomorrow, so I figured\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, mom will help you prepare.\u201d Xu Enzhen\u2019s voice was trembling, she seemed a little at a loss and said, \u201cWhat should I prepare, what does he like, what does he lack? Ah, I need to go to the mall tomorrow\u2026 Oh, by the way, does he want to eat a cake? He should be twenty years old this year, I don\u2019t know what kind of cake he likes to eat, I\u2026\u201dShen Xingchen held his mobile phone, watching the rain marks on the glass outside the window. He softly asked, \u201cMom, why are you crying?\u201d1another synonym would be \u201clicking dog\u201d.

He didn\u2019t know when it became his task; but because Shen Xingchen couldn\u2019t wake up the alarm clock at all, he could only rely on manpower.However, to his surprise, Shen Xingchen woke up by himself today.Jian Xingsui was shocked: \u201cWhy do you wake up so early?\u201d\u201cYou look down on me.\u201d Shen Xingchen snorted lightly: \u201cCan\u2019t I get up early?\u201d \u201c\u201c\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui nodded, as if he didn\u2019t experience how hard it was to wake Shen Xingchen up everyday.He didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s just his imagination or not, but he always felt that Shen Xingchen behaved very unusually these two days. He didn\u2019t know what the older man was doing \u2013 at times, he would go somewhere for a long time, and he wasn\u2019t as lazy as usual. In fact, it looked like he was preoccupied with something.Jian Xingsui was afraid that he would forget, so he specially reminded him: \u201cIt seems that the program crew has an arrangement this afternoon, let\u2019s go to the auditorium.\u201dShen Xingchen said while getting dressed, \u201cIt seems that there is such a thing scheduled today.\u201dNing Ze was the diligent one in the dormitory. Not only did he wash up long ago, but he had even finished exercising. He walked over and said, \u201cWell, today is Anran\u2019s birthday party. We should participate.\u201dIn order to prevent anything unpleasant from happening during the recording, the program team prepared a script for everyone to act.Jian Xingsui went to the bathroom to brush his teeth. He said as he walked, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching the layout of the auditorium for the past two days, it should be quite grand. You should try to find a good place for the recording, so you can get good camera shots.\u201dAlthough Ning Ze didn\u2019t talk much, he was well-informed, \u201cJian Family ordered a very large five-layered cake, and it just arrived this morning. Because we have more than 50 trainees, I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be enough for everyone to eat. I heard it is specially customized.\u201dJian Xingsui paused while brushing his teeth.He wanted to smile along with him, but he couldn\u2019t help the corner of his mouth twitch.Shen Xingchen put on his clothes and walked over while still sniffing, \u201cWho wants to eat that broken cake? It\u2019ll probably taste boring anyways, and it will just be a waste of food and air.\u201dJian Xingsui laughed after hearing it.After washing up, they came out of the dormitory, but they didn\u2019t expect to run into Anran\u2019s group head-on.Many trainees in the corridor knew that Anran was definitely going to make his debut, plus he has the backing of his wealthy family. It was no surprise that people flocked towards him, greeting him in a sensible way. Even if they were just gaining some level of familiarity, it was enough. They also verbally sent their blessings:\u201cHappy birthday, Ranran~\u201d\u201cThe birthday boy is here!\u201d\u201cRanran is very handsome today!\u201dAnran couldn\u2019t stop smiling, and he thanked each one shyly, \u201cThank you everyone, I will invite you all later to the party. Let\u2019s eat the cake together.\u201dOf course, the other trainees agreed, after all, they have done enough on the surface.Soon, Anran also walked in front of Jian Xingsui. Just as the group was about to pass by, Jian Xingsui wanted to pretend to be invisible, but Anran\u2019s voice came out: \u201cSuisui.\u201dJian Xingsui paused.Anran followed the others and said hello: \u201cXingchen-ge, hello, how is Ning Ze?\u201dShen Xingchen didn\u2019t have anything good to say when he opened his mouth: \u201cHuh? Who is talking? Oh, hello there, birthday star.\u201dAnran didn\u2019t like Shen Xingchen\u2019s tone. But no matter how he felt, he could only accept it, so he could only smile awkwardly in response.But soon, Anran remembered his main purpose, so he set his sights on Jian Xingsui again, but he said it loudly for everyone to hear, \u201cWe have cooperated on several stages before, and we are all friends now. This time I want to thank everyone for their care, so don\u2019t be polite, I have prepared gifts for you tonight, and I want to give them to you in person.\u201dSeeing Anran\u2019s hypocritical smiling face, Jian Xingsui suddenly felt tired. He was too tired to continue pretending to feel okay in front of the camera. And today was his birthday, he wanted to treat himself by taking a day off.Just a few days ago,he had a low fever and was hospitalized. Although he was recuperating during this time, he still occasionally coughed and felt weak, so he took the opportunity to say, \u201cThank you for the invitation, but I\u2019m not feeling well. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll infect everyone if I attend the party. I\u2019ll ask the director for a leave this afternoon, so I won\u2019t go.\u201dAnran looked at him sideways in surprise: \u201cWhat\u2019s uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cWhat else is uncomfortable, of course it\u2019s because your eyes are uncomfortable to see.\u201d Shen Xingchen actually felt fine but he said, \u201cAnyway, I also feel uncomfortable.\u201dAnran glared at him angrily.Jian Xingsui felt funny in his heart, but he didn\u2019t show it. He just said to Anran, \u201cThat\u2019s about it,\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAnran was a little disappointed. He knew that today was also Jian Xingsui\u2019s birthday; however, Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t say it himself, so Anran couldn\u2019t say it if he still wanted to be in the viewer\u2019s good graces1as in, if the viewer knows that Anran knew of Jian Xingsui\u2019s birthday, they may criticize him for celebrating his own birthday so grandly and not Jian Xingsui\u2019s.. In case other trainees asked them to celebrate their birthday together\u2026 let\u2019s not mention on how Jian Xingsui was more popular than him, and maybe the money invested by the Jian Family would only benefit Jian Xingsui instead. Although\u2026 in that case, he could accuse Jian Xingsui for stealing the limelight he doesn\u2019t deserve, but still, that wasn\u2019t worth the loss of popularity Anran would feel if they celebrated their birthday together.Therefore\u2013Anran thought about it in his heart, and actually felt that it would be better if Jian Xingsui really didn\u2019t come, so he said, \u201cWell, you can take a good rest at that time.\u201dJian Xingsui nodded, and Anran let them go.As the dusk settled, most of the trainees had gone to attend the birthday party. As for Jian Xingsui, he was reading alone in the library.The library was situated one floor higher than the auditorium. He was sitting by the window, and he could see the cheery atmosphere of the party from here. The lights there were bright, the ribbons and balloons were fluttering wildly, looking so dazzling as it reflected the bright overhead lights. The lively sounds from the happy people below echoed loud and clear even to the library.Jian Xingsui heard that both Jian Zhi and Jian Kuo were also here, somehow able to attend despite their busy schedule. The family reunion was very touching, and the photographer was seriously recording this beautiful moment.Jian Xingsui looked at it with his chin propped up. He was a little sad when he first heard about this, but now his heart has calmed down. He looked at his former relatives surrounding another person, and it made him a little numb.Xiao Mi came over and said, \u201cSuisui.\u201dJian Xingsui was a little surprised to see him coming.\u201cI sent you your mobile phone.\u201d Xiao Mi looked at it and sighed, \u201cI only found out about your birthday today from the director. They didn\u2019t arrange anything for you this time, so I asked for special circumstances to send you back your mobile phone. He said that you can use it freely today.\u201d\u2018It was compensation.\u2019Xiao Mi couldn\u2019t say the truth out loud.Jian Xingsui took the phone and said with a smile, \u201cThank you.\u201dXiao Mi looked at him and suddenly felt a little sad. On the same day, there were two different celebrations \u2013 one with a grand party, and the other could only sit alone in a quiet corner and spend his days silently. They were both popular trainees with the same age, but they led a completely different life. But no matter how much he pitied Jian Xingsui, he was helpless.Xiao Mi said: \u201cThen I\u2019ll go first.\u201dJian Xingsui was very polite: \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dAfter he left, Jian Xingsui turned on his mobile phone. This was the first time he got his mobile phone back after a long time. After opening WeChat, the person who sent him the most messages was actually Wang-ge, his manager, and his words could be roughly divided into several categories:[Anyway, you will definitely not make your debut. Stop wasting your time and retire from the program soon.][We already accepted one million yuan for you. You cannot breach the contract.][Think about the consequences yourself, otherwise I will not be able to help you.]Jian Xingsui went through these in silence without replying.In fact, he had already thought about it before he participated in \u201cStarlight\u201d. As the protagonist, Anran had a halo. If he didn\u2019t want to die like he did in his previous life, the most important thing he should do is to avoid him. At first, he planned to get as much money as possible, then quitted the entertainment circle the moment his contract expired. After that, he hoped to move into another city, or even abroad, and build a new life for himself there. Even if there\u2019s a couple of years left in his contract, it wouldn\u2019t matter much. The worst thing that they could do to him was to hide him from the public eye, so he wouldn\u2019t get any job or popularity. He didn\u2019t care much about these things.Scrolling further, there were no more messages.Jian Xingsui clicked on the text message on his mobile phone, and found sadly that there were only text messages from 10086 and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China that wished him a happy birthday. Even the Zhang Family didn\u2019t greet him.When seeing this, Jian Xingsui\u2019s heart sank a little bit, but he wasn\u2019t that sad. Maybe because he had already prepared mentally before, and naturally he wouldn\u2019t face that kind of sadness of not meeting his expectation.However, he still felt lonely.He needed to learn to get used to this feeling slowly.While looking at his phone, someone came from behind and patted him on the shoulder: \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dJian Xingsui shivered, and looked back in disbelief: \u201cXingchen?\u201dShen Xingchen leaned against the table and took Jian Xingsui\u2019s book in his hand, \u201cWhat is this? Grimm\u2019s fairy tale? What a gloomy book, don\u2019t read it, come with me.\u201d\u201cHuh..?\u201dJian Xingsui was caught off guard by him and pulled him outside, hesitatingly asking, \u201d Where are you going? Are you not filming the show? Why did you come out?\u201dShen Xingchen said confidently, \u201cI sneaked out.\u201dJian Xingsui was silent, if someone else did such a thing, he might be surprised. But this was Young Master Xingchen. He was willful enough to do this kind of thing, and maybe, he should do whatever he wanted, that\u2019s just how he is.Jian Xingsui felt a tiny bit envious of that.If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1as in, if the viewer knows that Anran knew of Jian Xingsui\u2019s birthday, they may criticize him for celebrating his own birthday so grandly and not Jian Xingsui\u2019s.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tomorrow, I\u2019ll upload 5 bonus chaptersJian Xingsui followed Shen Xingchen down, and when he went downstairs, he heard the sound of thunder exploding in the sky outside.\u201cWhere are we going, Xingchen?\u201d Jian Xingsui followed him and said, \u201cIt seems to be raining outside.\u201dShen Xingchen responded, and finally brought him to the door of the classroom, and said, \u201cGo in, I have something to discuss with you.\u201dWhen Jian Xingsui arrived, he didn\u2019t notice anything wrong. After all, it\u2019s not uncommon for Shen Xingchen to do something weird because of his eccentric personality. He pushed the front door.\u201cSqueak\u201dThe door opened.Before Jian Xingsui could see the inside clearly, he suddenly heard a loud crack, and then a handful of colorful streamers floated in the air, spun around and landed on Jian Xingsui\u2019s body.\u201cHappy birthday!\u201dCheerful voices greeted in unison.Jian Xingsui opened his eyes, and found that Wen Shengge and Ning Ze were standing side-by-side near a table, and Shen Xingchen was standing behind them. The three of them were laughing, with a small party streamer in their hands.\u201cYou, you\u2026\u201d Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t react for a while, and even stuttered when he spoke: \u201cWhat are you\u2013?\u201dShen Xingchen rubbed his nose as he swaggered, \u201cWhat, you can\u2019t tell what it is? Isn\u2019t today your birthday?\u201dJian Xingsui wanted to talk, wanted to ask how they knew, how they sneaked out, and where the little party streamer came from \u2013 thousands of questions spun inside his head, but in the end, he didn\u2019t know what to say first. He hesitated for a while, lips still gaping without a sound. He hung his head, his eyes reddened in a visible speed.Shen Xingchen hastily said, \u201cHey, no need to be thankful, brother. This is just how it should be, I\u2019m just good like that, and as my younger brother, how can I not give you a birthday party?\u201dJian Xingsui smiled through tears.Why does this dumbass always have the ability to break the atmosphere in one sentence?Ning Ze took Jian Xingsui inside and said, \u201cCome here.\u201dJian Xingsui followed them and saw the table behind a row of small ribbons. On the table was a table of hot dishes, which looked a little strange: fried shredded potatoes with tofu and green leafy vegetables, a bowl of mixed soup, all kinds of flavored rice piled in a haphazard manner\u2026Ning Ze said: \u201cIt\u2019s all Xingchen\u2019s suggestion. He said that for your birthday, we need to have home-cooked dishes.\u201dWen Shengge complained, \u201cBut it\u2019s really bad. He had zero cooking skills.\u201dShen Xingchen blushed in shame, and grumbled, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dWen Shengge shutted up.In fact, he didn\u2019t need to say it, Jian Xingsui knew that the food on this table probably didn\u2019t taste very good. But seeing the steam coming out from the food also warmed up his heart. He was satisfied with the sincerity he felt.Shen Xingchen said: \u201cDon\u2019t hate me, I will let you eat something delicious later.\u201dJian Xingsui was puzzled: \u201cHuh?\u201dA woman suddenly came inside. It was now late autumn. She wore an off-white woolen sweater with a light orange knitted coat. There was an exquisite and beautiful gemstone brooch pinned to her chest. Her black hair hangs down to her shoulders, wavy and neat. She looked like she should be nearly forty years old, with a palpable gentle feeling emanating from her.The ribbons fluttered in the air, and they looked at each other from a distance, separated by some distance.Jian Xingsui froze in place. A strange feeling bubbled up from his chest, making him speechless.Shen Xingchen yelled: \u201cMom, why did you come here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s raining, and there\u2019s a traffic jam on the road.\u201d Xu Enzhen said softly, her voice was also so quiet and gentle. She was carrying a lot of things in her hand, but she didn\u2019t let it bother her as she continued to say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss it, but fortunately, I came in time.\u201dShen Xingchen didn\u2019t expect her mother to come here alone.She was dressed very formally today, as if she got up early to put on delicate makeup, put on decent clothes, brought the things she had prepared earlier, and concentrated on coming to the party.Shen Xingchen quickly walked over to pick up things: \u201cWhy do you buy so many things? Are they all for me? Which one of them is a gift for Suisui?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Xu Enzhen clarified, \u201cThey are all gifts for Xingsui. \u201cShen Xingchen stared at his mother in confusion.Xu Enzhen walked slowly in front of Jian Xingsui. She raised her head and looked at the child in front of her. Jian Xingsui was standing under the light. He was a head shorter than Shen Xingchen and looked way thinner. He should be younger than Shen Xingchen, with baby fat still stubbornly clinging on his face.If you look closely, Jian Xingsui\u2019s and Shen Xingchen\u2019s facial features were\u2026 quite similar.As Xu Enzhen looked at Jian Xingsui in silence, the youth looked back in confusion and helplessness.Xu Enzhen didn\u2019t know exactly why, but her heart was overflowing with feelings of pity whenever she saw this child.Jian Xingsui reached out and held the older woman\u2019s extended hand without hesitation, with a soft and crisp voice: \u201cHello, Auntie.\u201dWarm hands wrapped around Xu Enzhen\u2019s somewhat cold hands.After Xu Enzhen felt the temperature, she gripped Jian Xingsui\u2019s back back: \u201cHello.\u201dShen Xingchen leaned over and said, \u201cMom, where is the cake you brought?\u201dXu Enzhen recovered, and she was a little embarrassed when she mentioned this: \u201cWell, Mom originally planned to make cakes by myself, but I didn\u2019t know why, but I failed many times. In the end, I had no choice but to ask someone to buy it for me.\u201dShen Xingchen said in disbelief, \u201cWhy would Auntie1not actual Aunt, but housekeeper/maid. let you bake by yourself? She knew none of us have any culinary talent, right?\u201dNone of their family has any culinary talent. It was like a curse.Xu Enzhen glared at him.Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t notice the hostile glare and continued to ask, \u201cThen who do you ask to buy it?\u201dXu Enzhen was about to speak when the outside door was pushed open again, and someone walked in with long strides. The man was clad in a black, striped suit and leather shoes. He should have come here from some kind of event. It\u2019s been a long time since Fu Jinxiao wore such formal attire. His handsome face and elegant temperament made him instantly become the center of attention.As everyone stared at the actor, he was holding something in his hand, and asked to nobody in particular with a smile, \u201cAm I late?\u201dXu Enzhen said: \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. I just arrived too, thank you for your hard work tonight.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Fu Jinxiao walked in and said, \u201cThis was originally bought in advance, and should\u2019ve arrived a long time ago. However, thanks to the uncooperative weather, this was almost late.\u201dJian Xingsui was confused. But he immediately focused on the sentence \u201cbought in advance\u201d.What\u2019s the meaning?Did Fu Jinxiao pre-ordered a cake already?How do these people know? Jian Xingsui seemed to be hit by a pie falling from the sky2hit by a good thing out of nowhere., and he was at a loss for what to do now. On one hand, he felt overwhelming joy that burst into the top of her head; and on the other hand, he wondered whether this might not be true at all.Fu Jinxiao stood in front of him, the tall and handsome man looked down at him, and said, \u201cLong time no see.\u201dJian Xingsui curled up his hands subconsciously by his side, and nodded slightly: \u201cIt\u2019s been a while, indeed. Are you busy with work?\u201d\u201cWell, I do have a few jobs lined up in advance,\u201d Fu Jinxiao glanced at him: \u201cIs your body recovering well?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded, \u201cUn. I\u2019m fine now.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re not very good,\u201d Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice was a little teasing, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that this cake came in time. If you don\u2019t celebrate your birthday after all this, you will miss this opportunity to make a wish today. Where else can you go to wish for good health?\u201dJian Xingsui instantly smiled, his cheeks rosy from happiness, \u201cThank you.\u201dThe two of them talked here, but they looked a little silly to others.Shen Xingchen\u2019s eyelids twitched. Ning Ze and Wen Shengge did not expect that Jian Xingsui and Instructor Fu could chat so naturally. They seemed to be so far apart as a person, yet able to communicate so smoothly.Fu Jinxiao put the cake on the table and said, \u201cOpen it and see if it\u2019s deformed.\u201dNing Ze quickly stepped forward to take the cake.Thankfully, it was not deformed. It was a two-layered blue cake, with a golden star inserted on the top of the cake, which was dazzling and eye-catching.Ning Ze and Wen Shengge helped put in the candles, and the cake lit up with a yellow candlelight. The shimmering glow bounced, giving the room warm light. The two of them stood by the table and smiled happily: \u201cSuisui, happy birthday.\u201dThe candlelight gave the room a feeling of familial warmth.Fu Jinxiao stood beside him and called his name: \u201cJian Xingsui.\u201dThe youth turned around.Fu Jinxiao hooked his lips up. He took out a small golden crown from nowhere, folded the crown, and he waved to him: \u201cCome here \u201cJane Xingsui walked over in a few steps to the front of the actor. With every step, his heart became hotter.The ribbon fluttered, and the young man standing below looked at his idol with some hesitation. This person who was once unattainable to him stood in front of him, and everything seemed like a dream.Fu Jinxiao looked at him and said, \u201cBirthday gift.\u201dWhen he got closer, Jian Xingsui realized that this little crown was not made of paper, and there seemed to be an inscription on the inner wall. It was an abbreviated F.He instantly recognized it at a glance. Others may be confused, but he was Fu Jinxiao\u2019s hardcore fan, after all. This was a souvenir from when Fu Jinxiao won the championship in 2007 when he challenged the variety show again as a repeat contestant.This was the crown of glory that only the C-position3center position / number 1 in ranking. can have!Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t care about any pretense anymore, he stammered and said: \u201cThis, this is\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao\u2019s eyes darkened, and he whispered: \u201cYou know this.\u201dJian Xingsui stammered even more. For a while, I didn\u2019t know if he should admit it or not.\u201cThis is a souvenir I got when I won in \u2018The King of Songs\u2019 in 2007.\u201d Fu Jinxiao played with the crown\u00a0 in his hands, and slowly narrated in a low and magnetic voice, \u201cAt that time, I was not famous and only had a few fans. When I participated in the first season of \u2018The King of Songs\u2019 in 2005, I failed in the competition, which resulted in many of my fans quitting. Even I myself began to doubt whether I could be a successful singer.\u201dFu Jinxiao curled his lips up while talking, recalling a fond memory, \u201cThen, there was this little fan. They diligently sent me private messages of encouragement every day. They often said that my elimination was not because I was inadequate. They made me believe in my own ability again, made me believe that I still have a bright future in this industry.\u201dAt that time, Jian Xingsui was still young, and what he said was naive. He never thought deeply about what he sent. He just followed his enthusiasm and composed whatever he felt inside his heart. Who would\u2019ve known that it was that sincerity that helped his idol from his low period? It was precisely because of his firm companionship that Fu Jinxiao regained enough confidence to continue his career and eventually became who he is today \u2013 someone on top, shining with gold.Fu Jinxiao approached him and whispered: \u201cNow I will also give you this crown.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s heart was overwhelmed, and he looked at the person in front of his in disbelief.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s fickle eyes were always stained with a smile, even with a gentleness that he didn\u2019t realize. His voice is low and magnetic: \u201cHappy birthday.\u201dShen Xingchen from behind came over and said, \u201cOh, hurry up and blow out the candles, we are waiting for dinner!\u201d \u201c\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was a moment of silence in the air.Jian Xingsui quickly regained his composure, ran back and chuckled, \u201cOkay, okay\u2026\u201dHe stood by the cake, saw Xu Enzhen standing there and smiled at her. He clasped his hands together, making a wish. He did not wish for good health. Instead, he wished for this moment of happiness to stretch into the future, and for everyone present today to have good health.It was so quiet inside the room, in sharp contrast to the howling winds and roaring thunder outside. Xu Enzhen continued to look at the boy next to her with an unblinking eye. His facial features were 50% or 60% similar to Shen Xingchen, especially the lowered eyebrows and eyes. When his eyes were closed, they looked exactly the same.In a trance, Jian Xingsui\u2019s figure overlapped with the child Xu Enzhen dreamed of in her dream.Everyone said that he was dead, everyone said she had a mental problem. Every time Xu Enzhen dreamed of that child, she could hear her baby following her around, crying out \u201cMom, Mom.\u201d in a soft, childish voice. He wasn\u2019t a noisy child, but quite sensible and obedient. In her dream, he grew up slowly.Her dream always engulfed her in a melancholic mood. She knew it wasn\u2019t healthy.But\u2026 it\u2019s only in her dream that she could see her baby growing up. From watching him tumbling around as a toddler, speaking his first words, slowly growing up\u2026 even watching him being bullied by his peers but not being able to help. As her baby grew older, his figure became hazier. His face was unclear. But she missed him even more.Shen Xingchen said: \u201cAfter making your wish, you can open the presents. Mom, what did you buy?\u201dXu Enzhen came back to her senses, her eyelashes trembled slightly. After calming down her turbulent emotions, she walked to the table to pick up the things she brought. She turned around and smiled at Jian Xingsui and said, \u201cAuntie doesn\u2019t know what you are missing, so I just buy everything that comes to my mind. Xingsui, come here and see what you need, I hope you like them.\u201dJian Xingsui came over, staring at the pile of gifts on the table. He said in a low voice, \u201cThis\u2026 must cost you a lot.\u201dXu Enzhen shook her head. She slowly took the various items out of their packages, and showed it all to him, \u201cThis is a knee pad for dancing. When I watched your live broadcast, I saw that you always bumped your knees when you danced. I hope you find this useful. As for this, this is a calcium supplement. You are still growing and your body needs nutrition to keep up, especially because you\u2019re too thin. Plus, I heard that you were sick some time ago. You must pay attention to your body. And as for this\u2013\u201dShe pointed out the items and its function, while Jian Xingsui just stood in front of her and patiently listened.After Xu Enzhen finished speaking clumsily, a pair of gentle eyes greeted her. Jian Xingsui was holding something, a little stiff and shy, and finally nodded and said, \u201cI like them all.\u201d\u201cAlthough\u2026 isn\u2019t this too expensive?\u201d Jian Xingsui held these things and said softly, \u201cI\u2019ve never received so many gifts\u2026\u201dXu Enzhen looked at the thin child in front of her, looking lost amidst the pile of gifts. His trembling hands made her feel distressed.For many years, she had a hard time getting through this day, because she always thought\u2013If that child hadn\u2019t died, today would be his birthday. What would he look like? What kind of things does he like? What kind of gift should she prepare for him? How tall is he now? Does he have a good life?However, today, for the first time, she did not have that sense of loneliness. When she saw Jian Xingsui, she felt a strange feeling in her heart, as if her heart was filled.\u201cBoom!\u201dThere was another muffled thunder outside, which made Xu Enzhen\u2019s heart tremble.She looked at Jian Xingsui in front of her, subconsciously stretched out her hand, and asked in a low tone, \u201cCan I\u2026 hug you?\u201dWithout resisting, he put everything in his hand aside, then nodded and smiled: \u201cYes.\u201dThe sound of the rain outside was pattering, and the young man was under the dim light, with a faint smile in his eyes, looking directly at her with an honest eye.In a trance, Xu Enzhen seemed to see her grown-up baby.In the dream, he followed her step-by-step and shouted \u201cMom, Mom\u201d. And then, that child was slowly swallowed by the darkness, and left her just like that.She couldn\u2019t catch him. She saved him. No matter what, she always lost him.Xu Enzhen\u2019s hand trembled. She pulled Jian Xingsui into a loose hug, as if pulling her child in a dream.She failed to do this in her dream.But this time, a warm figure hugged her back. His body was distressingly thin, but it was warm and filled with breaths.She caught him this time.Xu Enzhen\u2019s breathing became erratic, and the sadness in her heart was churning like a stormy sea. She hugged Jian Xingsui tightly, and couldn\u2019t control her tears any longer. She said tremblingly: \u201cMy son\u2026 My child\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui originally just wanted to give an ordinary hug, but when the older woman hugged him with such sad eyes, his heart tied into a knot. Strange emotions bubbled up into his throat, making him uncomfortable. Not knowing what to do, Xu Enzhen\u2019s trembling call sounded in his ears, making Jian Xingsui\u2019s eyes tremble slightly. His hands seemed to be out of his control, and he subconsciously hugged Xu Enzhen back, and murmured\u2014\u201cMom\u2026?\u201dIf you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1not actual Aunt, but housekeeper/maid.2hit by a good thing out of nowhere.3center position / number 1 in ranking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But even in such a cacophony, Xu Enzhen still heard that soft call.\u201cMom\u2026?\u201dThe call was hesitant. Soft. Unsure. And\u2026 longing.Her body tensed almost instantly, her eyes widened in disbelief. Tears fell on Jian Xingsui\u2019s shoulders \u2013 she could hardly control her emotions, so she stepped back a little, trying to subdue her heart. She looked at Jian Xingsui with blurry vision. In her trembling voice, she asked, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\u201dJian Xingsui was also a little surprised after murmuring that word.Why would he say such a thing?This was clearly Shen Xingchen\u2019s mother, he wasn\u2019t confused about that.Was it really because he longed for his family so much in his heart, so he couldn\u2019t restrain himself after being treated gently\u2026?He was so ashamed and annoyed at himself. He didn\u2019t want to offend Madam Shen1She\u2019s married to the Shen family, so she is sometimes referred to by this title instead., so the youth had no choice but to bow his head embarrassedly, trying his best to lie, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I didn\u2019t say anything, maybe\u2026 uh\u2026 did you hear me wrong?\u201dXu Enzhen herself was confused. Was she really misheard that longing, soft call?Did she hear it wrong? She missed her youngest child so much, to the point of having hallucinations? This youth might have some similarities to her second son, but that\u2026 didn\u2019t justify using him as a substitute for her youngest son, right?Xu Enzhen sighed inwardly. She was still a little bit lost and sad. She heard Jian Xingsui say softly, \u201cHowever, Auntie, thank you very much for coming to celebrate my birthday with me today.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s voice was hoarse and stilted, as if the words were stuck in his throat. Still, he continued, \u201cI, I am very happy.\u201dAfter finished speaking, he lowered his head, not wanting Xu Enzhen to see his reddened eyes. He didn\u2019t want anyone to see his pathetic state.But Xu Enzhen\u2019s heart was still soft and she held Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand. In a very gentle tone, she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me, nor thank my son. A birthday celebration is a must for us, you\u2019re not making trouble or anything like that. If you don\u2019t dislike it, I will come to celebrate your birthday every year in the future, okay? And\u2026 and, you can still treat Xingchen as your own brother\u2026\u201dHer voice was filled with maternal grace.Soft, patient, kind.After Jian Xingsui heard this sentence, the last line of defense in his heart seemed to have shattered to pieces. He nodded lightly, and at the same time, hot drops of tears fell from his cheeks.He\u2019s so, so happy.He never felt this happy before.This familial warmth he craved for two lifetimes\u2026 felt so unreal. Did the happiness actually make him delusional? This must be a dream, produced by his desires that intoxicated his entire being.But even in his wildest dream, he never dared to imagine his friend\u2019s mother treating him this well. After all, if his adopted family of twenty years and his biological family couldn\u2019t treat him nicely\u2026 why would a stranger do it?Seeing Jian Xingsui silently crying like that, Ning Ze and Wen Shengge, who was not far away from the cake, brought Jian Xingsui a big slice to cheer him up, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s eat the cake!\u201dShen Xingchen also walked over slowly and said, \u201cFinally I can eat, I\u2019m really starving to death. Let me taste it first~ Oh, Mhmmm. Fu-ge, where did you buy this cake? It\u2019s so delicious! Next time, you can buy me one for my birthday too, hehehehe.\u201dFu Jinxiao smiled as he said bluntly, \u201cYou ordered a birthday present in advance?\u201dShen Xingchen almost nodded. But then he realized, and immediately shook his head frantically.How could this guy be so cunning!He actually wanted to fool this young master with a birthday cake as his present? Bah, he doesn\u2019t want that! Birthday cakes are a given! Separated from gifts!He knew very well that the Fu family was a real wealthy family, the kind that probably descended from aristocracy from centuries back. Even if Fu Jinxiao casually fooled him with things that are worth hundred thousands yuan every time, he wouldn\u2019t easily be fooled! This young master wasn\u2019t easy to bully, even if it\u2019s by the devil Fu Jinxiao himself!Accompanied by this noisy group of people made him forget that his birthday party was only attended by a handful of people. It might be so, but that didn\u2019t diminish the sense of cheer they brought to him. As they were sharing the birthday cake, more people gradually came over.Tuya was the first one to come over, and the blonde beauty smiled as she said in a cheerful tone, \u201cWow, I just guessed that you guys are throwing some kind of party behind my back! Am I not invited? So mean~\u201dJian Xingsui looked at the newcomer in surprise, \u201cInstructor Tuya?\u201dTuya handed a gift box in her hand to Jian Xingsui, \u201cI heard from the staff that today is your birthday, I hope I wasn\u2019t late to the party.\u201dJian Xingsui took the gift in disbelief. He wasn\u2019t expecting to receive even more gifts, so he could only bow and said, \u201cThank you very much, Instructor!\u201dThe lady smiled and patted his head gently.She had a good impression of this polite and serious boy. Truthfully, she had a lot of complaints about the different treatment between the two birthday boys by the crew, so she came over immediately after attending Anran\u2019s party. Besides, she was actually biased towards Jian Xingsui. Not that she would show it blatantly, though.What Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t expect was that Tuya was just the first person to come from the main party. Slowly, other trainees also came over one after another. They actually heard about this occasion because of a hearsay from the staff.\u201cSuisui, you didn\u2019t tell us it was also your birthday.\u201d\u201cWow, who cooked these foods? These are so unpalatable\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course we\u2019re coming for your birthday.\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t expect everyone to come. Slowly but surely, the originally sparse classroom was filled by more and more people sneaking into his party to give him birthday blessings. Some even give him gifts. Many trainees chose to attend because they were helped in some way or another during the first or second stage, as Jian Xingsui was kind enough to fine-tune their musical arrangements. Many of them remembered this kindness in their hearts, so they immediately decided to come after asking around the staff about Jian Xingsui.After the program group finished filming Anran\u2019s birthday party, many people chose to come here in a heartbeat. It was now very lively and full of people.As for Anran, there were quite a lot of people arriving during the filming of the show. But after the filming ended, Anran found out something was wrong, because the previously lively bustle became more quiet. He could only see a handful of people sticking around, mostly people he regarded closer than a colleague. As for everyone else, they seemed to have gathered together in another place.Anran and his family stood at a corner, and saw a classroom across suspiciously lively, with all kinds of laughter and shouts. Because it was dinner time, the cafeteria reopened, and many trainees who didn\u2019t have enough cakes went to the cafeteria to eat together. Because of special permission from the instructors and program crew, the meal was richer than usual.Anran pointed to the cafeteria and said, \u201cWhat happened here\u2026?\u201dXiao Mi, who had just been given a small piece of cake, came out of the cafeteria. He was a staff member, so Anran dared to grab him and ask.Xiao Mi answered, \u201cOh, it\u2019s Suisui\u2019s birthday. Everyone is here to celebrate him.\u201dAnran actually guessed it, but when the staff said that, he felt a little uncomfortable. It was because the cafeteria was really too lively, and the instructor who had just left early from his birthday also was here. Originally, Anran thought the instructors just had something else to do, and he didn\u2019t guess it was to gather around the birthday boy\u2019s main seat for dinner. Even the Movie Emperor Fu was there.The thing is, at his birthday party, several other instructors at least went to show some politeness but Fu Jinxiao didn\u2019t show up at all. Everyone thought that Actor Fu was busy with work so he didn\u2019t come, but this time, Fu Jinxiao appeared by Jian Xingsui\u2019s side. All of the trainees could see it\u2026 isn\u2019t this equivalent to slapping himself in the face?Jian Zhi also noticed it, and he was thoughtful, \u201cThe program team held two parties?\u201dXiao Mi quickly denied, \u201cNo, no, the director team didn\u2019t arrange it, it was spontaneously done by the trainees.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAnran and his family fell silent again.Anran\u2019s birthday was celebrated by everyone, as it was arranged by the program team thanks to Jian family\u2019s sponsorship. They even made it to a special segment for the show. But Jian Xingsui\u2019s birthday party was spontaneously organized by everyone out of their own will. There\u2019s no monetary incentive, but they did it anyway.Doesn\u2019t this sound ironic? Doesn\u2019t it seem that he is not popular compared to Jian Xingsui?Seeing that Anran was unhappy, Mr. Jian2Anran\u2019s father. It\u2019s actually \u201cFather Jian\u201d but that sounds awkward\u2026 snorted coldly, \u201cWhat\u2019s spontaneous? Didn\u2019t he say that he was not feeling well? In actuality, he celebrated it with such fanfare. If he was well enough for a celebration, why didn\u2019t he at least congratulate Ranran?\u201dJian He actually had cruller things he wanted to say, but he was aware that he\u2019s in public. He has always been a mature entrepreneur in front of other people, so he had an image to maintain.Xiao Mi secretly overheard this sentence and was really stunned silent by this shameless rhetoric.If this logic was followed and applied to Anran, then why didn\u2019t Anran go to congratulate Suisui? Why did Jian Kuo have the attitude and rhetoric about Suisui and feel sorry for Anran? Did Suisui owe their family?\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s really weird.What a bunch of brain-dead family.1She\u2019s married to the Shen family, so she is sometimes referred to by this title instead.2Anran\u2019s father. It\u2019s actually \u201cFather Jian\u201d but that sounds awkward\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 36.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Jian Xingsui\u2019s spontaneous birthday celebration was over, most attendees left.Jian Xingsui personally escorted some of them to the cafeteria\u2019s door, waving goodbyes at them. He was left with his roommates, a couple of instructors, and a handful of other trainees. After the lively celebration, it was clear that everyone\u2019s energy was exhausted, so they could only talk in a relatively low voice.Not long after, Jian Xingsui received a notice from the program group.It seems that\u2026 he had a special visitor. The Zhang couple came to visit him and were waiting in the guest hall. He didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion, but Jian Xingsui felt that the couple seemed to avoid the program group\u2019s activities every time. When he first came here, they felt very wary as they were here, as if they were afraid of being photographed by the camera.During that time, he didn\u2019t think these details were important, so he shelved it.But now, he could only guess why their behavior was that way.However, seeing it\u2019s still his parents \u2013 no matter how estranged they might be \u2013 Jian Xingsui still went. At least, he must greet them, even if it\u2019s only to escort them out of the vicinity. He was still bound by filial piety, after all.However, the difference from last time was\u2026 this time, he no longer harbored any unrealistic\u00a0 fantasies, nor did he feel that the couple really came to see him and not for Anran. He would be foolish to think otherwise. They definitely came for Anran\u2019s birthday, but might as well have greeted Jian Xingsui as they already came here.\u201cSuisui!\u201dAfter entering the guest hall, he heard a familiar call within a few steps.Jian Xingsui stopped as he saw Mrs. Zhang ran towards him. She rushed to hold Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand, but Jian Xingsui gently avoided it out of pure reflex.Mrs. Zhang froze in place, surprised by such a gesture.Jian Xingsui, still in polite demeanor, spoke as if he didn\u2019t avoid Mrs. Zhang\u2019s gesture, \u201cDoes something happen at home?\u201dZhang Xiangyang didn\u2019t see Jian Xingsui for a while, and for some reason, the youth looked much older and mature. He walked up to Jian Xingsui, and looked at the child in an odd look. The older man opened his mouth to speak, but hesitated. In the end, he didn\u2019t say anything.Jian Xingsui asked again patiently, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, is something wrong? Or do you need me with something?\u201dZhang Xiangyang wanted to say something, but Mrs. Zhang pushed her husband away, and she spoke on his behalf, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing home, no need to worry. Besides, isn\u2019t today your birthday?\u00a0 We came especially to see you, we bought you gifts and a birthday cake.\u201dJian Xingsui was a little surprised to see that there was really a cake on the table not far away, and there was a neatly wrapped box next to it.Unexpectedly, this couple actually seemed to be celebrating his birthday\u2026?No, there must be a hidden reason why.After learning the previous lesson, Jian Xingsui would not be so easily fooled anymore. He hardened his heart and asked, \u201cDo you need me to call Anran for you?\u201dMrs. Zhang was taken aback by this youth\u2019s unexpected words. With disbelief in her tone, she asked in return, \u201cSuisui, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cNo need to say anymore, I understand,\u201d Jian Xingsui mercilessly exposed them, \u201cIsn\u2019t your main purpose to come to see Anran? Today is Anran\u2019s birthday, after all.\u201dA guilty conscience flashed across the Zhang couple\u2019s eyes. But Mrs. Zhang immediately recovered, quickly smiled and said, \u201cYou child, what kind of nonsense are you talking about? How could it be because of this? Anran naturally has his current family to accompany him. Since he has returned to the Jian family, he will celebrate his birthday with his birth family. And as for you, you are our child, you have come to live at our house and celebrate your birthday together from now on.\u201dZhang Xiangyang also nodded, and the man said in a hoarse voice, \u201cListen to your mother. Happy birthday, my child.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe room was silent for a moment.For a while, Jian Xingsui was a little confused about the true intention of his birth parents. Whether what they said was true or not, or what their true motives were.Seeing that he was not moving nor talking, Mrs. Zhang quickly went to the sofa behind and took out a kraft paper bag out of the box, put it in front of Jian Xingsui and said, \u201cMy child, this is a birthday present for you. Look, it\u2019s from a famous brand. We specially bought it for you. I even went to a specialty store to buy it for you, so you won\u2019t get a fake one. And it does cost a lot of money.\u201dJian Xingsui saw Mrs. Zhang took out a set of clothes and shoes from the paper bag. It was a set of sportswear, complete with in-theme shoes. Seeing the distinctive logo displayed on the fabrics, it was definitely from a well-known sports brand.He wasn\u2019t picky with his fashion choice. When he was still living in Jian family\u2019s house, he was considered a half-young master. With a fairly affluent family and a deep coffer, he was familiar with various luxury brands of clothes. And this set of sportswear bought by the Zhang couple was familiar to him at first glance. This was definitely considered quite luxurious for a middle-income family. It must cost quite a fortune.Jian Xingsui suddenly felt a little ironic.He could smell the stench of overcompensation from miles away.\u201cReally?\u201d He felt wretched, he kinda hoped they were cheated with a well-made fake brand. He tried to control his tone, hoping it to be as neutral as possible, \u201cYou said it was sold in a specialty store?\u201dMrs. Zhang thought he believed their words, so she said, \u201cUhm well, we bought it from a store in a big shopping mall. I\u2019m confident they won\u2019t sell fake ones there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui looked at the things Mrs. Zhang was holding, and listening to her exaggerated words. He inexplicably felt that everything was numb, and he could only tune in with one ear open. During his dazed state, he thought of Xu Enzhen again.This world was really strange. Some people you\u2019ve met only a few times could treat you with all their heart and soul, give you everything you need with sincerity. While some other people were your biological parents, the ones sharing your blood, but their fake sincerity could be seen even by the blind. They would talk big, as if afraid of their \u201ckindness\u201d being misunderstood.In the end, Jian Xingsui still had one question\u2013What exactly was love?He didn\u2019t understand. All of its nature was mysterious, with unclear instructions. Sometimes it was given without any ulterior motives, but sometimes it was purely transactional.He really\u2026 didn\u2019t understand.Seeing him in a daze, Zhang Xiangyang tentatively asked, \u201cSuisui, after this show ends, will you go home with us?\u201dJian Xingsui recovered, and he replied: \u201cI have my own plan for my future career. I won\u2019t go back there for the time being.\u201dWhen he said that, Mrs. Zhang became anxious.\u201cSuisui, you have to go back, okay? Did you\u2026 dislike that study room? Yes, yes, Mother understands, don\u2019t worry. It is too small, very humid, and without an air conditioner. We already prepared Anra\u2013 I mean, another separate room, and you can live there comfortably when you go home,\u201d Mrs. Zhang\u2019s tone lowered, as if trying to comfort him, \u201cAnd\u2026 if you need anything, just tell me or your father, and we will buy it for you.\u201dAh, so they actually knew\u2026 that living in that cramped study room was really uncomfortable?At that time, it was very hot and humid. Anran\u2019s room was air-conditioned, but they were reluctant to let him live inside that deserted room. So instead, they pretended not to know how miserable it was to live inside that room.If this was him before his rebirth, Jian Xingsui might have jumped with joy when he heard this. He would gobble up any scrap of kindness that was offered, even if it was laced with poison. But now, all he wanted was to give out a sarcastic smile and sneered at this very suspicious change of heart. However, he couldn\u2019t smile, not even moving his lips.Mrs. Zhang still wanted to talk, but Jian Xingsui blocked her words: \u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cSince it wasn\u2019t mine in the first place, I don\u2019t want it either.\u201d Jian Xingsui raised his head and looked at the two people in front of him. Inside his beautiful pair of deep brown eyes, there was only calmness and acceptance. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, since I came here to participate in the program, after I leave, I have never thought about going back there to live again.\u201dMrs. Zhang\u2019s heart sank, \u201cSuisui, what are you talking about?\u201dMost of the time, Jian Xingsui was a very talkative child. But once he figured it out, he was able to say such cold-hearted things with a decisive attitude.He knew he wasn\u2019t loved by his biological parents. So he wouldn\u2019t crave it anymore.Might as well cut their relations cleanly.Jian Xingsui looked at the gift in his hand, \u201cThank you for remembering my birthday, I appreciate this kindness.\u201dJust when Mrs. Zhang was about to speak, Jian Xingsui changed the subject again.\u201cBut it\u2019s also thanks to you guys who reminded me that time was tight and I didn\u2019t have time to go through such formalities. Anran\u2019s surname and household registration have been changed, but mine haven\u2019t.\u201d Jian Xingsui said, \u201cI thought that, when the shooting for this program ended, shouldn\u2019t we also go through the same formalities?\u201dMrs. Zhang smiled, and said, \u201cIs it to do the transfer of the household registry? Then, it\u2019s no problem!\u201dJian Xingsui shook his head, \u201cNot that, at least for now. Instead, I want to do a paternity test between me and Mr. Zhang. You have done Anran\u2019s, but we haven\u2019t done it. Since we have to go through the formalities, let\u2019s deal with it as soon as possible.\u201dWhen his voice fell, both Zhang Xiangyang and Mrs. Zhang\u2019s pupils shrank. They were both frozen in place.They were actually frozen by shock and fear.If\u2026 If Jian Xingsui found out that they weren\u2019t biologically related, he would definitely try to track down his actual biological parents.And then\u2026 he might have stumbled upon the truth of why such child exchange happened back then.Wouldn\u2019t what they did twenty years ago be made public, then?If so\u2026What would happen to them?The weight of their sins were closing in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, just after one o\u2019clock in the morning, when everyone was still sound asleep, the alarm bell of the whole building suddenly rang.There were wailing sounds from many dormitories, and some people even came out only in their underpants:\u201cWhat happened??\u201d\u201cIs that the fire alarm?\u201dHowever, in the next second, the voice of the broadcast echoed through the corridor, \u201cAttention to all trainees, please wash up and arrive in the hall to assemble within half an hour. Everyone, be sure to be there.\u201dThe broadcast was repeated several times, reminding them over and over again.At the beginning, no one paid attention, as everyone still wanted to continue to sleep. Unexpectedly, five minutes later, the broadcast sound appeared again: \u201cAttention to all trainees, please wash up and arrive in the hall to assemble within 25 minutes. Any latecomer will face consequences.\u201d Then, they announced the countdown.Jian Xingsui sat up from the bed in a jolt, and Ning Ze, who slept in the bed beside him also got up.While putting on his clothes, Ning Ze said, \u201cWake Xingchen up, let\u2019s assemble.\u201dAlthough Jian Xingsui was very sleepy, hearing the countdown to the meeting instantly refreshed him. He nodded, got up quickly, put on his clothes, and stood up. After glancing at the still-peacefully sleeping Shen Xingchen, he sighed: \u201cXingchen, wake up.\u201dThe young master turned a deaf ear, turned over and continued to sleep.Jian Xingsui had no choice but to go to the bathroom. He got a wet towel and hit Shen Xingchen directly on the face.Shen Xingchen cursed softly, and sat up with a wet towel sticking on his face, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201dJian Xingsui sighed, and just as he was about to speak, the countdown on the broadcast sounded again: \u201cAttention to all trainees, please wash up and arrive in the hall to assemble within 20 minutes.\u201dJian Xingsui shook the little ancestor Shen, \u201cDid you hear that? Hurry up, we are going to assemble soon.\u201dWhen Shen Xingchen got up, he was very angry. Hearing the cold-toned broadcast only added fuel to the fire, \u201cIt\u2019s only one o\u2019clock in the morning, what are you going to do together, go to hell!\u201dThe voice was so loud that it almost knocked over the door.Jian Xingsui was so close that his eardrums were about to rupture. He cringed as he said: \u201cThere must be something wrong, don\u2019t delay and get up quickly, or you will be late later.\u201dThe more he was forced to get up, the more he refused to do it.Just as he was struggling, the horn in the corridor rang again. This time it was no longer the voice of the staff, but the voice of Actor Fu. His voice was slow, but it gave people the feeling of giving an ultimatum, \u201cAttention to all trainees, it is now the last 5 minutes. Please assemble in the hall immediately, do not be late.\u201dWhen Actor Fu\u2019s voice fell, there were chaotic footsteps in the corridor.Jian Xingsui was in a hurry this time, so he said to Ning Ze next to him, \u201cCome here and help me carry him up!\u201dNing Ze hesitated: \u201cAre you serious??\u201dJian Xingsui nodded fiercely: \u201cCome on!\u201dSo, almost everyone in the hall had arrived. The cameramen started preparing for the shooting. But then, a commotion broke out, as many trainees focused their gaze on Ning Ze\u2026 who was carrying the still-sleeping Shen Xingchen on his back. Jian Xingsui followed soon, carrying their belongings.\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone in the hall was silent for a few seconds.After a while\u2013Someone took the lead in laughing.Even the audience in the live broadcast room were amused:[Even on this occasion, Xingchen is still able to sleep through?][Ning Ze really looks like a father, and Suisui next to him is like an old mother.][Hahaha, you are not afraid when Xingchen said he\u2019ll beat you up?\u201d]Because of this funny scene, the number of comments in the barrage increased, and the popularity of the live broadcast room also increased a lot.After everyone arrived at the hall, they were asked to get on the bus prepared by the program crew. After everyone got on the bus, the instructor said in front: \u201cEveryone should sleep for a while. We will wake you up when we arrive at our destination.\u201dIt was still around one o\u2019clock in the morning, so obviously, many people were still half-asleep.A trainee asked where they were taking them, but the instructors all smiled and did not answer directly.Of course, Shen Xingchen was also one of those who continued to sleep. When the bus stopped again, the young master finally woke up. Sleep still muddling his brain, he groggily asked, \u201cWhy am I in a bus?\u201dJian Xingsui, who was taking a nap next to him, sighed and said helplessly: \u201cWe tried to wake you up\u2026 but it was futile, so we just carried you over.\u201dBefore Shen Xingchen could figure what Jian Xingsui meant, someone outside the bus shouted to get off.At this time, it was past two o\u2019clock in the morning, and it was still pitch black everywhere. There were street lights where the bus stopped. The trainees gathered with the cameraman and finally got a clear view of the place.Instructor Li said, \u201cHello everyone, this is Mount Tai1Mount Tai (\u6cf0\u5c71 T\u00e0i Sh\u0101n) is a sacred mountain in Shandong, China, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site., one of the five famous mountains. Our task today is to climb to the top of Mount Tai before sunrise to see the great rivers and mountains of our motherland!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was a moment of silence.It was impossible for anyone to think that they were suddenly pulled up in the middle of the night to climb a mountain. It was really surprising.Instructor Li smiled and said: \u201cI knew that everyone was very surprised. Our rule today is that whoever climbs to the top of Mount Tai first will have the right to independently select songs and form a team in the final performance.\u201d\u2026the temptation was indeed, very big.Tuya, who stood next to him, was also wearing a mountaineering suit. She said, \u201cAlso, we have prepared huts at each short rest stop. The first team to reach the hut will have a surprise waiting for them~ Please try your best to climb the mountain!\u201dThe trainees seemed to be a little bit more energetic.Shen Xingchen even asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the surprise, Instructor?\u201dTuya shook her head and cheekily said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if I told you, would it?\u201dSince the instructors told them so, of course the contestants could only explore it by themselves. However, many of them also had great expectations for this surprise, and everyone became immediately hooked.Seeing everyone eager to try, Fu Jinxiao said lightly, \u201cThis time, there is no limit to the number of people in each team, and you can form your own team.\u201dAfter hearing this, everyone was even happier!Jian Xingsui was courageous: \u201cThere is no limit on the number of people, that is to say, can two or three people form a small team?\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dThis news was very good for many people. Since the first selection eliminated half of them\u00a0 last time, there are only 56 people left in the whole scene. This time, they have rested for a few days, which means that the announcement of the second selection would be announced soon. Their public ranking would be displayed, and another half of them would be eliminated. As for the final stage, the top 16 would be able to participate.Maybe\u2026 today\u2019s mountaineering activity would be their last time together. Everyone needs to cherish the time they have now.When grouping, Shen Xingchen said to Jian Xingsui almost without hesitation: \u201cNeedless to say, we are in a group of three!\u201dNo one had any objections.One member of their trio didn\u2019t wake up properly just an hour ago, but now, they were all nice and ready to face the activity together.Shen Xingchen said: \u201cCome on! Take first place!\u201dSeeing how fast he was running, Jian Xingsui couldn\u2019t help reminding him: \u201cConserve your energy, this climb won\u2019t be done quickly! We need to be able to walk near the end!\u201dShen Xingchen scoffed at his words: \u201cI won\u2019t be able to walk? Who do you look down on?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTen minutes later\u2014The young master sat on a big stone by the roadside, gasping for air. His cheeks were flushed, and yet, he was still able to complain his heart out, \u201cI\u2019m so tired! Why haven\u2019t we arrived at the first rest point yet?\u201dAlong the way, other teams kept catching up with them. Although there were also a couple of teams who trailed behind them at a slower pace.Ning Ze took a look at his binoculars and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a red flag over there, I guess the rest point is there.\u201dJian Xingsui wanted to complain a long time ago, \u201cZe-ge, where did you get the binoculars?\u201dNing Ze cheekily said, \u201cI brought it from home myself.\u201dWhy on earth would anyone bring binoculars to a talent show? Was this a reasonable action done by a sane person?Jian Xingsui\u2019s dumbfounded expression was recorded in HD by the program crew, and it quickly became the laughing point of the audience:[Hahahaha, I have the same expression just now.][Ning Ze, what surprise will you bring next? I\u2019m looking forward to seeing it soon.][Be strong, Shen Xingchen!]Jian Xingsui glanced at the people at the foot of the mountain and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get up and run quickly, otherwise we won\u2019t be able to get to the rest stop if someone overtakes us. Didn\u2019t Instructor Tuya say that only the first team arrived can get the surprise gift?\u201dShen Xingchen moaned, \u201cBut I really can\u2019t walk now! I feel like my legs don\u2019t belong to me anymore! \u201cJian Xingsui wanted to say that Shen Xingchen only reap what he sowed.After all, how could anyone be as aggressive as him? Just rushing forward without caring about whether or not his own physical strength can keep up?Ning Ze sighed as he offered, \u201cDo you want me to carry you?\u201dShen Xingchen shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m a man. How can a man be carried? Who are you looking down on?\u201dHis words amused Jian Xingsui. He almost chuckled.Jian Xingsui rolled up his sleeves and walked forward, and then squatted down in front of Shen Xingchen: \u201cI\u2019ll give you a massage.\u201dShen Xingchen said vigilantly, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dShen Xingchen\u2019s leg snapped over. He didn\u2019t know which acupuncture points were pressed, but fuck does it hurt. He began to howl at the top of his voice. This sound seemed to startle the birds in the forest into fleeing.Shen Xingchen cried, \u201cTake it easy, man!\u201dJian Xingsui then put down his movements, and he asked next to him, \u201cHow is it, does it feel better?\u201dShen Xingchen found out after a while, \u201cHey, now that you\u2019re asking me, I do feel less tired than before!\u201dJian Xingsui smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dThe three of them quickly set off to the rest stop, and while walking, Shen Xingchen said: \u201cWhat kind of massage method do you use? Why is it so effective? Please teach me.\u201dJian Xingsui replied, \u201cI learned this when I was at home before. My father and brothers were busy with work, so I taught myself from books and online courses.\u201dShen Xingchen tsk-ed, clearly disapproving, \u201cI see that you still have this ability.\u201dJian Xingsui said proudly: \u201cThis is a unique secret recipe developed by myself, and others may not have that effect.\u201d\u201cCheapskate.\u201d Shen Xingchen hammered him, clearly joking, \u201cIf you don\u2019t teach me, then I\u2019ll no longer be your big brother!\u201dJian Xingsui pursed his lips and smiled happily.Finally, their group reached the halfway point of the mountain.The staff who had been waiting there for a long time said, \u201cCongratulations for arriving here! Since you are the first group, you can get rewards. Now, all three of you can go to that hut over there to check your ranking in this selection. At the same time, you can choose to give your fans an interactive live broadcast for three minutes. We have already opened the live broadcast room.\u201dThe three were ecstatic.They didn\u2019t expect it to be such a surprise.Shen Xingchen said: \u201cYou two go first, I\u2019m exhausted and don\u2019t have the energy to talk now.\u201dNing Ze was not in a hurry. He said to Jian Xingsui, \u201cYou go first, I\u2019ll have something to eat, I\u2019m famished.\u201dJian Xingsui had nothing to do first, so he agreed with their suggestion. He obediently nodded and entered the hut.The staff talked as he put an envelope on the table, \u201cThis is your ranking for this selection. Please turn on the live broadcast on your mobile phone in front of you after watching it, and interact with your fans for three minutes.\u201dJian Xingsui nodded in understanding, \u201cThank you.\u201dThere was an envelope on the table, and Jian Xingsui reached out then opened it. He won third place in the first selection. At the second stage, he used his original composition to let many audiences watch his brilliance. After finishing his performance, he also won the Popularity King voted by the audience. It could be said that he did his best to perform, and the feedback from the audience was also good. His ranking should rise, or at least stable at third.When Jian Xingsui opened the envelope, he saw a line of words on the page: \u201cCongratulations to Jian Xingsui! In this stage, your ranking is 15th. Congratulations on entering the final stage. Please continue to work hard.\u201d1Mount Tai (\u6cf0\u5c71 T\u00e0i Sh\u0101n) is a sacred mountain in Shandong, China, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 37.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe youth sat there, completely silent as he stared at the paper for a long time.The hard work he put in\u2026 every sleepless night he spent, every experience he suffered because of dancing practice, every drop of sweat he shed\u2026 seemed to turn into a joke on this piece of paper. This was his reward? For all of that?The staff hesitated and said, \u201cSuisui?\u201dJian Xingsui quickly came back to his senses, and smiled: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve finished reading it. So, then I\u2019ll start the live broadcast.\u201dWhen the staff saw his expression, they only stiffly nodded. Judging by their reaction\u2026 they probably guessed it just by observing Jian Xingsui.They probably also understand some of the unspoken rules of the program group. Trainees who were not pre-casted in the debut position would not be able to succeed with just hard work. Money always spoke the loudest. Fanciful \u201chopes\u201d and \u201cdreams\u201d were just a fleeting leaf, blown by the gust.Reality and dreams were like heaven and earth. Jian Xingsui should stop being delusional about his future.The staff hesitated and said, \u201cSuisui, you\u2026 erm\u2026 you can tell the fans what you want to say. You can also solicit votes for yourself, and then you have to let the audience see your ranking in this stage.\u201dJian Xingsui nodded, and he clicked the \u201cstart live\u201d button on the live broadcast app. As a participant who was always recorded by the live broadcast camera, this was his first time being able to see the live barrage.After the audience saw that it was Jian Xingsui, many people were very excited:[It\u2019s Suisui!][Wuwuwu, I stayed up late until almost three in the morning, and I finally saw you, baby\u2026] [cute crying sounds][Although he is not my bias, I\u2019m fine with this! Hello Suisui~]Jian Xingsui bowed politely to everyone with a smile, and said, \u201cHi everyone, I\u2019m Jian Xingsui, nice to meet you.\u201dThe live broadcast room was filled to the brim with comments. It was impossible for him to read it all.Jian Xingsui handed out the card in his hand for everyone to see: \u201cThis is my ranking for this stage. I am very grateful for everyone\u2019s support for me. I will work hard in the future.\u201dThe audience could clearly read the words written on the paper.Just as Jian Xingsui thought, they were shocked into speechlessness.[Did I read it wrong???][Is it fifth or fifteen?][Why did his ranking drop so much?]The fact that Jian Xingsui changed from third to fifteenth shocked the audience, including many neutral audiences and netizens. Not long ago, Jian Xingsui\u2019s ranking was still hovering in the top six debut positions, why did he suddenly drop to fifteenth today?They weren\u2019t stupid. They actually have a guess they kept locked inside their heart. They just didn\u2019t dare to say it outloud, lest it offend the other party involved.Many fans also began to leaving questions and comments on the screen:[Is it really fifteen? Could it be that I got it wrong?][How is it possible, the fanclub has spent millions on voting tickets.][\u201cWhy is it fifteen, my God\u2026 My friends and I even used our relatives\u2019 phone numbers to help with voting1it\u2019s implied, as it was the normal operation in China, that to have a legitimate vote, you need a verifiable Chinese phone number. And as for extra votes, you need to buy them with real money.!]Jian Xingsui watched the barrage quietly for a while.The staff next to him reminded him: \u201cThere are still two and a half minutes left, you are required\u00a0 to say something to the fans.\u201dThis was a very precious opportunity, after all. His ranking has dropped too much, so if he was smart, he should know how to mobilize the high emotions of his fans to canvass more votes to compete.But the young man sitting on the chair has always been very calm. After taking a deep breath, Jian Xingsui smiled: \u201cI am very grateful to everyone voting for me. From the depths of my heart, thank you. If possible, I would like to suggest\u2026 not waste your money on buying voting tickets for me. If you have extra spending money, use it for yourself. Go watch the new movies, buy a meal from a good restaurant, or something like that.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s unexpected words baffled the audience. However, he paid it no mind and continued, \u201cSave the money to do more meaningful things. But still, thank you for liking me. If the lives of my fans are good, I too, will be happy. Very\u2026 very happy.\u201dHe knew this kind of ranking was inevitable. His agent has said so. Even Fu Jinxiao had indirectly implied it.That one million yen Wang-ge always used to threaten him\u2026 it\u2019s clear to him that the debut position has already been pre-determined, even maybe since before the show started filming.However, despite all the psychological preparation he had, he still felt wronged. He wanted to cry, but he couldn\u2019t.The audience exploded:[What are you talking about, Suisui??][Are you crazy!][It\u2019s not a waste of money, I am willing to do this!]But the more the fans were like this, the sadder Jian Xingsui felt in his heart. He took a deep breath, not wanting to show any strangeness in front of the fans, so he did his best to continue in a softer voice, \u201cIf you have extra tickets in your hands, please use it to vote for Xingchen and Ning Ze instead. They are hardworking and excellent people. My dancing and singing are not very good, but both of them excelled at this. I hope everyone can support them.\u201dHe knew that he would leave \u201cStarlight\u201d soon.Along the way, he received a lot of love and care from his friends. As the inevitable goodbye slowly closing in, he realized there was nothing he could do beside this. He could only help his friends to debut. At least for them, it was still possible.After coming out of the cabin, Shen Xingchen and Ning Ze came over: \u201cHow is it, what is your ranking?\u201dJian Xingsui smiled and said nothing, he was afraid of affecting the emotions of his friends.Seeing the unusually silent Jian Xingsui, Shen Xingchen was panicking. He immediately thought of the worst case scenario. With a bated breath, he commanded, \u201cYou talk!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m entering the final stage.\u201d Jian Xingsui said, \u201cMy exact ranking doesn\u2019t really matter, okay? Instead, you two should hurry up and interact with fans. It\u2019s time.\u201dShen Xingchen and Ning Ze looked at each other, but Ning Ze went first.After he went in, Jian Xingsui and Shen Xingchen sat outside. The two of them didn\u2019t speak for a while. Jian Xingsui pretended to do something, in the stilted silence. However, he didn\u2019t understand why Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t speak at all.The atmosphere became inexplicably tense.All along, Jian Xingsui knew that Shen Xingchen was a carefree person. But this time, he was eerily silent. Although Shen Xingchen was always nervous, at this moment, he seemed to have guessed something.With every meeting, there has to be a parting.The time was near.Perhaps soon, they would have to separate, and from then on, they would walk on two different paths. Maybe it would never converge, like two parallel lines, infinitely stretching, never towards the other.Jian Xingsui tried to ease the atmosphere: \u201cDo you still want to learn that acupuncture point? I\u2019ll teach you.\u201dShen Xingchen returned to his senses, and waited for Jian Xingsui to glance at him with a vicious stare.Jian Xingsui innocently asked, as if nothing bad had happened, \u201cWhy? Is something the matter?\u201dThe thing was, Shen Xingchen had spent quite a long time with Jian Xingsui. He precisely knew how the youth looked when he was desperately trying to avoid a topic. Once Shen Xingchen saw the fragile, glassy look in Jian Xingsui\u2019s eyes, he understood. In return, his own eyes also reddened.Ah\u2026 sure enough, he guessed it.Jian Xingsui continues to pretend the elephant in the room doesn\u2019t exist.He sighed slightly in his heart: \u201cThen don\u2019t learn.\u201dSometimes, things were just not meant to be said out loud.Shen Xingchen snorted and lowered his head, \u201cTeach me when you go back.\u201dJian Xingsui replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cForget it, when I go back, I want to practice dancing, how can I have time to learn another skill?\u201d Shen Xingchen seemed to be deceiving himself.Then, he got an idea. Now, he insisted on forcing Jian Xingsui to make a promise with him, \u201cYou will teach me after we debut together in a group.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA short silence was his response.Shen Xingchen became impatient. He scolded with a hoarse voice, \u201cSpeak up!\u201dJian Xingsui looked up at him. In fact, there was no need to speak. The two sides already understood the situation. Shen Xingchen himself was sent by Shen Minglang to participate in this variety show. At that time, his older brother was talking about tempering his arrogance and character. And maybe, after experiencing some partings and bad, unfair things in the world, the ignorant yet just young master would understand the cruel way of the world, and would no longer be so naive.But\u2026\u2026Jian Xingsui looked at Shen Xingchen staring at his eyes, and suddenly felt a little soft-hearted. He smiled softly and nodded: \u201cYes, I will teach you.\u201dNot long after, Ning Ze also came out.The expression on his face was not very good either. Ning Ze was getting old, this was his last chance. If the result was not good, he might have to bid farewell to the stage forever.Shen Xingchen stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019m going in.\u201dJian Xingsui told him, \u201cAsk for extra votes from the fans. If your ranking is not low, you will compete for the center position.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an was his number one enemy, and he was committed to competing with him for the center position. The rankings of the two were also very close, and the competition was really fierce.Shen Xingchen snorted lightly: \u201cThat\u2019s not up to you.\u201dAfter entering the cabin, the staff handed him his stage ranking.Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t answer.The staff looked at him suspiciously, but heard Shen Xingchen say: \u201cI want to know the ranking of Jian Xingsui and Ning Ze.\u201dThe staff had never encountered such a situation before, so he hesitated and said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you, everyone can only look at their own ranking.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Shen Xingchen opened up his own ranking. He was ranked second this time. It\u2019s clear to him also, that the first place was either Anran or Li Xu\u2019an. Since both of them were the people he hates, normally speaking, he must work hard to get votes and squeeze those two out of the first place in the final selection.But when the live broadcast started, facing rows of the fan barrage, Shen Xingchen could only stare in a moment of silence.After adjusting his mentality, he said: \u201cHello everyone, I am Shen Xingchen.\u201dThe audience was very excited:[My Xing-baby! Mommy loves you!][You grew so big!][I vote for you every day.]The bad-boy young master smirked, making his fangirls go crazy. With his rogue-ish appeal, he spoke, \u201cIsn\u2019t it necessary to vote for me every day? That\u2019s just normal operation, you bad girl.\u201dThis young man was confident yet naive, childish yet had a wild appeal. His words always make people laugh or cry. He also was the type who knew what his fans like, so when he said those teasing words, his fans really appreciated it.However, Shen Xingchen suppressed his smile a little. This young master who always ignored everything was looking at the live broadcast room seriously at this moment. He did not choose to canvass votes for himself to defeat his old enemy, but said, \u201cToday, I\u2019m here to solicit votes for my brothers, Jian Xingsui and Ning Ze. I don\u2019t know their rankings, but I hope that if you have extra votes in your hands, you can vote for them.\u201dAt the barrage, Shen Xingchen saw his fans give him Jian Xingsui\u2019s ranking spoiler. Seeing it, his eyes darkened.It was the fifteenth place.At the last minute, Shen Xingchen was a little anxious, \u201cIf you are my loyal fans\u2026 can you save the votes you originally wanted to use for me and give Jian Xingsui a little bit? No need to give me too high of a ranking. So long as I can debut together with the two of them, not getting first place is fine.\u201dThis was a little ancestor of young master who always put a lot of emphasis on winning or losing.From childhood to adulthood, he has hardly experienced any setbacks and injustice. He has always had everything he wanted, and there was nothing he couldn\u2019t get. It was this kind of environment that created a fearless young master.His family sent him away because they wanted him to hone his character.And at this moment, the willful young master lost his original pride. He didn\u2019t have to win against Li Xu\u2019an. He didn\u2019t need to have the highest ranking possible.Shen Xingchen held the ranking card and took a deep breath. He said to the audience: \u201cI\u2019m counting on you, my people!\u201dThere was a burst of laughter in the live broadcast room.Jian Xingchen saw that many fans in the barrage had promised to help his brothers to vote for him. He also smiled, and made a clasped fist on the spot, and he almost missed the target with the audience. The depressed atmosphere before was completely turned into a funny scene.However, what Shen Xingchen did not know now was that the injustice of reality was the first lesson this world taught him. And soon, the cruelty of reality would be the second lesson the world taught him.1it\u2019s implied, as it was the normal operation in China, that to have a legitimate vote, you need a verifiable Chinese phone number. And as for extra votes, you need to buy them with real money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m sorry for uploading late (\u256f\ufe35\u2570,)After the three of them finished their live broadcast, they continued climbing the mountain.Jian Xingsui and his team already knew the rankings, and they were really tired from climbing the mountain before. So, it was inevitable that they no longer cared to compete in the climbing competition. Especially since mountaineering is really tiring physical work, especially in the middle of the night. They were hungry and tired. They wanted to eat some hot food\u2026When passing by a roadside stall, they saw someone was selling pancake rolls with green onions.Hungry people were beggars, not choosers. Jian Xingsui asked his groupmates, \u201cDo you want to eat?\u201dShen Xingchen nodded fiercely: \u201cEat!\u201dBut soon, the problem came again. Money.The owner of the stall was a middle-aged auntie. Seeing these three pitiful young men, her heart filled with maternal sympathy. However, business was business, and she would only accept a monetary transaction.The sharp-eyed Jian Xingsui saw someone eating in a stall not far away.Ning Ze said, \u201cIt\u2019s Fu-ge and the others.\u201dShen Xingchen\u2019s eyes lit up, and he confidently trotted over, \u201cFu-ge, Instructor Tuya!\u201dThe trainees were still climbing the mountain until they were exhausted. In contrast, the instructors were eating in a leisure manner. Evil capitalism\u2026 was always everywhere.Jian Xingsui and Ning Ze walked over together, and heard Shen Xingchen begging from a long distance: \u201cTake us to eat together, I\u2019m hungry!\u201dTuya smiled a little embarrassedly: \u201cXingchen, although I really want to take you to eat together, but the program team doesn\u2019t allow it. You have to exchange your own efforts for food. Don\u2019t you have star beans, you can buy them with star beans, 1 star bean is 1 yuan.\u201dThen everyone realized that they haven\u2019t try to use their star beans.But the bad thing was that Shen Xingchen wasn\u2019t used to being thrifty nor knew how to save money. He bought a water gun for the battle royale last time, and later exchanged it for various props. He had already spent all his beans.Ning Ze took all his beans to redeem the dumbbells.Jian Xingsui said: \u201cI still have a little more, I\u2019ll buy it for you.\u201dHe still had 30 star beans. But what he didn\u2019t expect was that the prices on the mountain were very expensive.The aunt raised her hand and gave the price: \u201cDo you want your jianbing1similar to burrito. with meat or without meat? If you want to add meat, it will cost 202btw, this is 20 yuan, which is outrageous prince for one (1) jianbing. Pretty sure you can get a good one for like, 5 yuan. a piece.\u201dIf no meat was added, there would only be green onions in this jianbing. Everyone was not very used to eating that sad excuse of a food, so they didn\u2019t want it. In the end, Ning Ze and Shen Xingchen managed to scrape together 10 star beans and bought two burritos with added meat. However, this means that the star beans weren\u2019t enough to buy Jian Xingsui\u2019s portion.Shen Xingchen looked at the breakfast table of the instructor not far away. He almost drooled when he caught a whiff of the delicious scent.Jian Xingsui advised him to look away, and while he was talking, he suddenly heard someone at the table calling him: \u201cJian Xingsui.\u201dThe youth who was talking was stunned and looked back.Fu Jinxiao, who was sitting at the table, saw him in a daze, and beckoned to him again: \u201cCome here.\u201dAfter Jian Xingsui was sure that Fu Jinxiao was calling him for him, he came over quickly: \u201cYes?\u201dFu Jinxiao asked, \u201cCan you do me a favor?\u201dWithout thinking too much, Jian Xingsui immediately nodded, \u201cOf course!\u201dWait\u2026 was he being tricked? He really answered that out of pure instinct as Fu Jinxiao\u2019s hardcore fan.There was also a mirth in Fu Jinxiao\u2019s eyes, \u201cGo and help me buy a bottle of water over there.\u201dAgain, Jian Xingsui nodded without thinking: \u201cOkay!\u201dAfter taking the money from Actor Fu, he immediately went to buy water without stopping. Tuya, who sat behind, looked at him with an odd look. Suddenly, she became surprised, propped her chin and said: \u201cHe trusts you very much, doesn\u2019t he? Why would he do that to a person like you?\u201dFu Jinxiao wiped his hands gracefully with a tissue, as if Tuya\u2019s words didn\u2019t slighted him a bit. He opened his lips to answer, \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m not a bad person.\u201dTuya dared not answer.After working together for many years, she knew how scary this man actually was.Jian Xingsui came back quickly after buying water, and handed it to Fu Jinxiao: \u201cYour water.\u201dFu Jinxiao said, \u201cThank you.\u201dJian Xingsui bowed and was about to leave, but was called away: \u201cCome back.\u201dA sandwich was stuffed into the bag. And as if Fu Jinxiao was afraid that the youth would not have enough to eat, he put extra two boiled eggs in the paper bag for him: \u201cDon\u2019t get hungry.\u201d\u201c???\u201dJian Xingsui never expected this kind of gift. He looked at Fu Jinxiao with both surprise and joy: \u201cI\u2026\u201dShen Xingchen behind him was also wow-ed. He even became a bit jealous, though he was being a good sport about it, \u201cHey, hey, hey! Didn\u2019t you say that the instructor can\u2019t help the trainees this time? Unfairrrr!! I want it too.\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyelids and glanced at him lightly: \u201cThis is his errand fee, aren\u2019t I just being fair and paying him for his work?\u201dShen Xingchen was a flexible man, so he shamelessly said,\u00a0 \u201cI can also run errands!\u201dThe voice was so loud that it shook the eardrums. Fu Jinxiao disliked such things, \u201cYou\u2019re so noisy.\u201dHe said it was noisy, but Fu Jinxiao still glanced at Tuya. After receiving the hint, Tuya had no choice but to say, \u201cThen please help me buy a bottle of water too.\u201dShen Xingchen resolutely ran errands happily, and of course Tuya gave him all the leftover food on the table when he came back.he audience also laughed watching this comical scene, feeling very emotional:[Fu-ge and Yaya-jie really take care of the children.][This really doesn\u2019t look staged too!][Hahaha, buy water! Let\u2019s be honest here, if wine was allowed, you two would\u2019ve drunk it, right?]After getting food for an extra-early breakfast, Jian Xingsui shared his sandwiches with the others. Eating it really satisfied all three of them, and not long after, they continued their mountain climbing trip again. They were still full of youthful vigor, so it didn\u2019t took long for the three of them to reach the top of Mount Tai.At this moment, it happened to be more than five o\u2019clock. As the sky dawned into a new day, the sunbeam gradually warmed up the cold night. The wind on the mountain was a bit cool, but for many people who climbed the mountain, they were all hot, and the wind was a welcome addition to help them cool down.The instructors of the program group have been waiting for a long time.Slowly, along the way, many trainees also came up. Even though the top of the mountain was packed with more than 60 people, everyone still lined up silently. They all stood up on the top of the mountain, facing the morning sun, in a solemn and contemplative manner.Fu Jinxiao said: \u201cAre you all tired?\u201dEveryone answered in unison, \u201cWe are!\u201d\u201cHow about compared to training?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t be compared!!\u201dFu Jinxiao chuckled at the liveliness, he then continued, \u201cI believe almost all of you already know of your ranking result?\u201d The actor glanced at everyone, \u201cHow are you feeling now?\u201dEveryone looked at each other without saying a word.Fu Jinxiao leaned on the rock behind him, and said slowly: \u201cFor those who have not advanced, I believe you have all seen the sentence on your envelope. That is, you can choose to give up climbing at any time and go back to rest. However, when the instructors and I arrived here, I got the news that none of the 56 trainees here is missing.\u201dAlthough half of the people were allowed to leave, and wanted to leave, all of them persisted until the end.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s face was a little more appreciative: \u201cNow, turn around.\u201dEveryone turned around in unison, and before they noticed, the scenery behind them changed again. The expansive dark blue of the night sky slowly engulfed by the gentle orange-gold hue of the morning sky. It hit the clouds, forming a golden line around it. The sun rises, bringing the new day, full of vigor.The sea of clouds looked like it was below them. The golden morning light seemed to shine on everyone.No words can describe the mood at this moment.The exhaustion of mountaineering was swept away at this moment. Everyone present was left with the deepest impression of this brand new sun.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice sounded from behind: \u201cIt might seem that the road to pick during climbing is the most difficult road. But in truth, there is no easy way to climb up. The downhill road is easy, but on that road, you will never see the most brilliant sunrise on the top of the mountain. Today, each of you can see this beauty of nature, because none of you gave up and persisted despite everything.\u201dTuya added, \u201cI hope that each of you can maintain such enthusiasm in the future \u2013no matter how long the journey is, or how hard it is. Never give up, because of this persistence, there will be hope to see the sun.\u201dInstructor Li also smiled, and gently said, \u201cEven if you get the exit ticket halfway, don\u2019t give up. Continue going forward boldly. If it is very hard, just grit your teeth. I believe your efforts will pay off someday.\u201d\u201cOnly in this way,\u201d Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice was slow but powerful, falling on the hearts of every student, \u201cOnly then\u2026 you will have hope, and see the dawn of the summit together as the victor.\u201dThe sun gradually rose, and the warm light was scattered on everyone\u2019s shoulders. With it, it also helped to sow the seeds of hope budding inside their hearts.The sun was a bit too bright now, and perhaps because it was too harsh of a glare, some trainees lowered their heads. Their eyes were red, and they wiped away their tears in embarrassment. This was originally a part that made some people feel sad and decadent, but under the ingenious arrangement of the program group, the sadness in their hearts was washed away.They have to work hard. They can\u2019t give up. They can\u2019t go downhill.Because only by persisting, could they hope to see a chance of being the ultimate victor.If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1similar to burrito.2btw, this is 20 yuan, which is outrageous prince for one (1) jianbing.

The next two chapters will be uploaded today!Next ko-fi goal for bonus chapter (1/2)Before everyone knew it, another half a month had passed.Only the remaining top 16 positions could advance to the final stage.The total filming time of \u201cStarlight\u201d lasted about four months, from the scorching summer to the falling leaves in late autumn. In this small cultural and sports hall, many trainee\u2019s blood, tears, and laughter were left behind. Alongside it, a waft of the trainees\u2019 youth and memories were also left in the crevice of the hall.As the grand finale of the show, it was also the busiest day for all trainees and the show\u2019s crew. The cars of the major media are parked at the back door. In order to facilitate the live broadcast and interviews with the participants, the crew sectioned off a part of the front door for admission tickets. Many fans and family members came to watch the live stage. For them, it was tantamount that they were able to witness their beloved ones ascend and debut. They didn\u2019t want four months of hard work down the drain, after all.But still, all would have to come to an end today.Backstage area.To say it was a mess was underselling it.Various makeup artists were anxiously applying makeup to the contestants. Today, all original 108 of them have come back \u2013 the eliminated contestants now have a chance to appear again, even as a cameo. However, their costumes were different from the top 16. Besides them, the crew also invited a couple of celebrity guests to help liven up the finale.Jian Xingsui was helping to arrange Shen Xingchen\u2019s clothes. He half-heartedly complained, \u201cWhy did you come back from the bathroom like this? Aren\u2019t you afraid of making your fans laugh when they look at your sloppy appearance?\u201dShen Xingchen snorted lightly: \u201cIt\u2019s just a crooked collar, how can this young master\u2019s charm be damaged by an untidy collar?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui sometimes hoped to have half of Shen Xingchen\u2019s confident for himself.Jian Xingsui sighed helplessly, but did not comment further.The opening ceremony of the final stage has already kicked off. This time, the performance hall was far grander from before. It has been fully upgraded, with a 360-degree surround screen, and much bigger overhead lights with various colors. As for the audiences\u2019 seating area, it was a huge half-circle that was currently jam-packed. They were also very lively, shouting and cheering at every possible moment.With the fog from dry ice sprayed up, the instructors appeared on the stage.Today\u2019s instructors were clad in exquisite formal dress. Tuya was wearing a white haute couture dress, Fu Jinxiao was also wearing a rare blue plaid suit, and even Instructor Li also wore a rare formal suit. Today was the night when the debut group was formed, so it was natural that all the instructors put on their best look as a sign of respect.Instructor Li said to the camera, \u201cThank you for coming to participate in the finals of this year\u2019s \u201cStarlight\u201d. On this night, our 108 trainees will complete their graduation ceremony, with our top 16 will be performing their final stage. In the end, the six debutants of this year will be determined!\u201dTuya took the conversation, smiled at the camera and said, \u201cSo far, the voting channel is still open from 7:00 to 10:30 PM. Don\u2019t forget to vote for your pick! This is your last chance, the last sprint before the finale!\u201dFu Jinxiao took the microphone, \u201cAnd also, a special voting channel from Octopus Live app and Sun Live app will also open. All verified members are eligible to cast their vote. The most popular contestant in each app will become the first image spokesperson for the respective application. For voting, you can directly search for \u2018Starlight\u2019 and click on your trainee of choice.\u201dAs each instructor spoke their piece, the tense atmosphere began to rise.Instructor Li went on to introduce: \u201cTonight we have 16 contestants, and they will form three teams to bring you wonderful performances. Let us look forward to it together!\u201dWhen the lights were dimmed down, the first group of contestants appeared on the stage.The song performed by Anran and Li Xu\u2019an was \u201cThe Sun\u201d, which had lyrical singing and hot rap. Anran\u2019s costume today was also very thoughtful, his usual fairy style was changed into a cooler one. The contrast to his usually cute image was very appealing, but also gave his fans a nice surprise. Frenzied cheers roared from the audience:\u201cRanran, come on!\u201d\u201cYou can do it! Debut!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Zhi-ge\u2018s1As in, Jian Zhi\u2019s fan. fan, I will definitely vote for you!\u201dIncluding Li Xu\u2019an, there were many popular contestants in this group. When they performed, the arena was also very explosive. The performance of the first group has already started well, and soon the second group also started to perform. Jian Xingsui and his roommates were in the third group, so they have been waiting below.From the very beginning, Shen Xingchen has been very nervous.Jian Xingsui looked at him and Ning Ze then said, \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, it\u2019s ourlast stage together, we must do a good job on our performance. At least, we have to leave a good final impression on the audience.\u201dShen Xingchen glared at him: \u201cWhat are you talking about? Unlucky words, what do you mean by our last stage together?\u201dJian Xingsui said helplessly: \u201cYes, yes, I was wrong.\u201dNing Ze stretched out his hand: \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go together.\u201dOther members of the third team also leaned over. At this moment, everyone has the same thought \u2014 whatever happens, let it happen. Let\u2019s do our best and leave the stage without any regrets.Soon, there was a shout from the MC on stage, \u201cLet us welcome our last, but not the least, team! The song they\u2019re bringing to us is \u2018The World Won\u2019t Collapse Easily\u2019!\u201dThey were greeted by enthusiastic applause. Of course, many of their fans also shouted their lungs in excitement:\u201cXingchen! Xingchen! You shine the brightest!\u201d\u201cSuisui, jiayou2literally \u201cadd oil\u201d. Equivalent to \u201cgo for it\u201d or \u201cbreak a leg\u201d!!\u201d\u201cMy babies! Rush for the top spot!!\u201dThe audience waved the light sticks in their hands, and kept shouting their bias\u2019 names. Their enthusiasm was infectious, and Jian Xingsui saw this as a form of the greatest support for them. He burned in this image in the depths of his heart. He would remember this moment for eternity \u2013 in this moment, this dazzling final stage was his.The team stood on the stage, and the background music slowly swelled up.After the second stage, Jian Xingsui\u2019s musical ability was recognized by the public. So of course, in this final stage, he would show the audience his ability again.As the lights dimmed, the young man standing at center held the microphone, and his low voice cleanly reverberated across the hall, \u201cAt the end of the show, the hustle and bustle gradually fades away. At this stage, I\u2019m watching myself perform.\u201dThe dance movements of the youths on the stage were gentle but not sloppy.Ning Ze took a step forward, slotted himself in the center, and sang in a low voice, \u201cI understand very well \u2013 all your grievances and uneasiness, all your hidden guilt, all your ups and downs.\u201dThe tune slowly picked up. This song was also re-arranged by Jian Xingsui. He dyed the song in his own style \u2013 making sure this version fits perfectly without damaging the original charm. Of course, he made better revisions, but he refused to change the core identity of the song, as it would be disrespectful to the original composer.\u201cNo matter how many complex changes happen.\u201d\u201cThe world won\u2019t collapse easily.\u201d\u201cThe false reality, the gap in hope; please hug me tightly, and I will not be afraid.\u201dThe spotlights danced with the choreography, and the overall melody was still quite low. When everyone was immersed in the current tone, the tune suddenly rose in a place that no one expected. The contestants\u2019 movement span was wider, and the dance movements were quick and detailed. This was a song full of hope and inspiration. It swelled up your chest, filling it with determination for a better future. It easily moved the audiences\u2019 emotions.At the last beat, Shen Xingchen jumped out from behind, slid and knelt on the ground on one knee \u2013 it was a very handsome visual impact. As he sang with a bombastic voice, his confidence resounded through the audience, \u201cNo matter how many complex changes happen, the world won\u2019t collapse easily!\u201dWhen his singing part ended, the chorus immediately followed.\u201cHow bad can it be?\u201d\u201cThe future may be unknown.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s face it together, hand-in-hand.\u201d\u201cWith a little courage, a little hope, this time will change.\u201d\u201cA better future dawns over the terrible present\u2026!\u201dThe high-pitched chorus was full of power, as if to blow up the entire venue with burning passion. Whenever it was Shen Xingchen\u2019s part, with his bubbling hot emotions, the audience always went wild. His voice was steady, yet his reddened eyes betrayed it. His warm and powerful singing had a melancholic touch in it, as if he was unable to explode it outwards.At this moment, Jian Xingsui\u2019s and Shen Xingchen\u2019s eyes met.With one eye contact, a turbulent undercurrent started whirling. A silent fight commenced \u2013 the one who accepted fate and the one who denied it.This world was filled with filth, injustices, and irresistible fate.They have no need of words to communicate. Instead, they put each other\u2019s shoulders and leaned tightly together. Sweat soaked everyone\u2019s backs, their breaths were rapid and uneven. The loud noises in their ears couldn\u2019t hide the intense heartbeats they heard inside their own chests. The screams, the cheers, the dazzling overhead lights, it was blinding, like a star collapsing in the vast, dark universe.The audience reached a fever-pitch high.\u201cCome on, my baby!\u201d\u201cYou must debut together!\u201dThe number of viewers in the live broadcast room has also reached tens of millions online. Since last night, all fans have been waiting with bated breath.[The adaptation of this song is amazing.][I know everyone is putting their 120%!][I don\u2019t like listening to adaptations, but I love every song that Jian Xingsui changed!]On the stage, the contestants stood in a row and bowed to the audience below. For many of them, this was the last stage \u2013 their grand finale, their pen-ultimate performance on this stage.But at this very moment, they knew they had said what they wanted to say. Their performance had succeeded, and that was all that ever matters.This stage wasn\u2019t a loss. They reached their goal.Everyone has worked hard on this journey. At the very least, they have landed on the top of the mountain; at the very least, they have seen the dawning sun together.They have not missed everything.They did it.If you think the lyrics are cheesy\u2026 that would be my fault. I\u2019m bad at this kind of lyrical translation\u2026 Just keep in mind that it\u2019s 100% cooler in Chinese.1As in, Jian Zhi\u2019s fan.2literally \u201cadd oil\u201d.

Instructor Li said, \u201cOkay, all the contestants who have finished their performances will go to the front stage, and we will start the second part of the show.\u201dAll three teams had completed their performances, and it was nearing the end.It was time to announce the final rankings.The instructors\u2019 gazes fell on the trainees and swept over everyone. Tuya smiled slightly and said, \u201cYou guys are different from before, and you have made great progress.\u201dInstructor Li teased, \u201cYes, I agree. You are not only progressing, but you are also refining your best qualities.\u201dThe audience cheered.Those who competed for 20,000 yuan also gave up even more money in the end, just to be able to perform on the final stage one more time.Jian Xingsui smiled shyly, taking it as a compliment.Fu Jinxiao picked up the cue card in his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s 10:31PM, all of the voting channels have been closed. I have the latest results in my hand.\u201dInstructor Li nodded, and he said: \u201cNext, we will start announcing the final ranking of the 16 trainees.\u201dOnly the top six can debut.Sixteen trainees stood on the steps, accepting the final arrangement of fate. The instructor began to read one by one. Slowly, six names were read. Among them, four trainees did not make their debut.The two who successfully debuted were Xu Qinke and Feng Fan. Their strength was not bad, and the company behind them was also very strong. The debut was also expected by everyone. But in this way, there were only four debut positions left.Shen Xingchen was very nervous from the beginning. He had always been a rowdy person, but from the beginning of this stage, he didn\u2019t say a word. When the debut contestants were embracing and celebrating, Jian Xingsui patted his brother on the shoulder and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, you can do it.\u201dShen Xingchen said, \u201cTake care of yourself first.\u201dJian Xingsui smiled helplessly.Among the few of them, Ning Ze was the one who was most worried. He was very strong. And honestly, Ning Ze\u2019s dance and vocal ability could be ranked in the top three. Moreover, he worked very hard, and the company behind him was also very capable.Before continuing, Tuya took a look at the card, smiled, and opened her lips, \u201cThe trainee I\u2019m going to read\u2026 well, he\u2019s good at both singing and dancing! After entering \u2018Starlight\u2019\u201d, he practiced hard and endured hardships. Relying on his own strength to achieve success again and again, he could be said as a good role model! As a good big brother figure in the heart of his fans, he is\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui and Shen Xingchen looked at Ning Ze with hopeful eyes.Tuya let go, \u201cHe is Li Xu\u2019an! Congratulations to you, Xu\u2019an, you have won the second place!\u201dThe audience was boiling.Li Xu\u2019an\u2019s fans kept screaming. Although he himself was not very happy with only second place. Li Xu\u2019an knew, if he failed to get first place, then it could only be Shen Xingchen who beat him. Was there a reason to celebrate such a failure against his mortal enemy?But in front of the camera, he still took the microphone with a relieved smile. He started his speech, \u201cThank you for all your support, thank you\u2026\u201dBehind him, Jian Xingsui took Shen Xingchen with one hand and Ning Ze with the other, comforting them softly: \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, it\u2019s okay, there will definitely be your name on the debut positions.\u201dAs the number of names that were read became less and less, there were still only three people in the debut positions.Jian Xingsui could feel that Shen Xingchen\u2019s hands were covered with sweat. Li Xu\u2019an went down. He should be the center debutant. The young master has put in a lot of hard work for this position. This was the victory he dreamed of. If it went well, or in other words, he should be full of happiness at this moment \u2013 he should show off his ability. But instead, his face was tense, and his palms were sweating.Shen Xingchen has always been an emotional person, even if he refuses to admit it.There were only three spots left. If he occupied one, only two were left. In a perfect world, those two spots were filled with his good brothers Jian Xingsui and Ning Ze. However, if there was just another debutant\u2026 then\u2026 he had to say goodbye to one of them.It\u2019s different from before.It\u2019s not only that they\u2019re assigned to a different group. It\u2019s not only that they won\u2019t train together. It\u2019s a farewell, a farewell to each other.Instructor Li continued to read the card, \u201cThe person I\u2019m going to read next\u2026 he is very young, but very talented. He was not favored in the first stage, but he chased after his own brilliance and proved to the audience what his true capabilities are. In addition to all of that, he is very good at composing, and he has a good character\u2026\u201dWhen Instructor Li said this, both Shen Xingchen and Ning Ze looked at Jian Xingsui.Even Jian Xingsui unconsciously had a little hope in his eyes. Although he knew it couldn\u2019t be him, he still couldn\u2019t help but look forward to it.\u201cHe is \u2014 Anran! Congratulations, Anran, you won third place! You received a total of 6.3 million votes in this stage. I hope you will continue to maintain it.\u201dMany fans shouted in the arena.There was a scream, and a smile appeared on Anran\u2019s face. He jumped off the stage with an exclamation. When passing by Jian Xingsui, he glanced at him intentionally or unintentionally, and then walked to the microphone with a happy face, \u201cThank you, \u2018Starlight\u2019 for giving me this opportunity! My friends, my fans, my family, I thank you for all your continuous support\u2026\u201dAs the name was being read, Shen Xingchen, who was standing next to Jian Xingsui, turned his face away.The young master had always been fearless in the past, and he always hated hypocritical people the most. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t be afraid of anyone, and no matter how hard or tiring it was, he wasn\u2019t the type of person who would admit being cowardly enough to turn their face away.Jian Xingsui looked over worriedly, but saw a scene that shocked him\u2013Shen Xingchen cried.He knew that if Anran made his debut, Jian Xingsui, who was also a singer, would definitely not be able to make his debut. He was crying that his brother could not form a group, he was crying about the upcoming parting, he was crying about the injustice of the program group.Jian Xingsui quickly grabbed him: \u201cYoung master, young master? Ge, what\u2019s the matter with you? This is a live broadcast, and the instructor hasn\u2019t finished reading. You still have a high chance of debuting, so don\u2019t cry just yet.\u201dNing Ze also came to comfort Shen Xingchen.On the other side, Tuya got another card, and she read it out, \u201cThe trainee who will be announced next, he is a warrior who has worked hard on the stage for decades. He is the one who perseveres and never gives up. Even if the world gives him the worst, he\u2019s always able to make the best of any situation! He is Ning Ze! Congratulations to Ning Ze, you are in the\u2026 sixth place! With a total of 4.62 million votes!\u201dWhen the announcement fell, the final debut line was basically finalized.There was some excitement at the scene, many people were congratulating Ning Ze. However, some\u00a0 people were going crazy:\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhat about Suisui?\u201d\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Suisui in sixth place?\u201d\u201cOh my god, this is not true.\u201dThe live broadcast room also exploded in an instant:[Fuck you! I\u2019m now crying in my dormitory!! Why didn\u2019t my Suisui debut!][What the fuck happened?? He was still in fifth place two hours ago!][I don\u2019t know why, since the announcement of Anran, I started crying when Xingchen was also crying. I had a premonition of this at that ime. But I\u2019m still so sad that I can\u2019t stop my tears.][Why didn\u2019t my baby debut? I\u2019m going crazy!!]When Ning Ze heard his name in the debut lineup, it was a dream come true. But instead of smiling, he looked at Jian Xingsui for the first time, with a sad look as if he\u2019s holding out his tears.As for the finale, Fu Jinxiao announced the first ranked trainee \u2013 and lo and behold, it was Shen Xingchen.However, the first ranker was crying hard. He held Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand, as if he wanted to keep the younger man as close as possible. Wen Shengge in the audience was also crying. Out of their four-membered dormitory, two made it into the debut lineup. But no one was laughing.Tuya said to Shen Xingchen: \u201cCome and give a speech?\u201dShen Xingchen wiped his face from ugly tears and snot, tehn spoke into the microphone: \u201cI don\u2019t have any speeches. To be honest, I don\u2019t really want to be in this group. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m the first ranked. What\u2019s going on? it\u2019s like a joke.\u201dHis slightly crying voice couldn\u2019t hold back his original domineering attitude. His clear voice carried out confusing words, resounding through every corner of the hall, blatantly declaring war to the program crew\u2019s decision.Of course Tuya understood what Shen Xingchen was upset about, but she didn\u2019t step forward to stop him.Everyone in the debut group would be given a small crown. The staff brought it over and wanted Shen Xingchen to wear it. He didn\u2019t wear it, but held it in his hand. After turning around two steps, he walked in front of Jian Xingsui.Jian Xingsui hesitated: \u201cYou\u2026\u201dShen Xingchen put the little crown on Jian Xingsui\u2019s head, and sneered, \u201cIt\u2019s quite suitable.\u201dEach of the six debut contestants had a share of this crown, and Shen Xingchen gave the one that belonged to him to Jian Xingsui. His actions caused an uproar. There has never been a center member who dared to openly provoke on the program crew, to the point of giving away the debut crown.For Shen Xingchen, one of these crowns was meant for Jian Xingsui, but due to unfair deals, he didn\u2019t get it. So, Shen Xingchen would correct that injustice by his own hands.He knew it was actually a futile effort. But that didn\u2019t stop him.Instructor Li wanted to ease the awkward atmosphere, so he said, \u201cNing Ze, can you express your thoughts on debuting?\u201dIn everyone\u2019s impression, Ning Ze has always been an honest and obedient person.Ning Ze was silent for a moment, walked forward and said, \u201cThank you everyone for supporting me, and I will continue to work hard in the future. Before this final night is over, I also want to do one more thing.\u201dHe unhesitantly turned around and walked to Jian Xingsui. He put his crown in Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand, and smiled with his lips curled up, \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201dUnder the camera of the live broadcast, the audience was in an uproar.What kind of final night was this? How outrageous were the debut contestants?The closest instructor to them was Fu Jinxiao from Tuya, and the staff of the program team kept whispering in their ears through their in-ear1kinda like small ear bud piece, \u201cMr. Fu, Ms. Tuya, please stop these two students and tell them that the rules do not allow this.\u201dFu Jinxiao stood by the side, looked contemplative for a moment, then he reached out his in-ear and took it off. He then pocketed it with a straight face.Tuya looked at him in surprise.Fu Jinxiao hooked his lips up, and there was a harmless smile on his elegant face: \u201cIt\u2019s been so noisy all the time, I can\u2019t hear the staff clearly. Maybe it\u2019s broken.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTuya was silent for a moment.But not long after, she decided to follow suit. With an innocent smile on her face, she pocketed her buzzing in-ear.Fu Jinxiao has always been good at being willful, provoking this doggy program group.She was just an innocent bystander. She saw nothing.1kinda like small ear budPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems that a lot of you all cried after reading previous chapters? Hey, you and me both, partner.The scene of the live broadcast could be said to be an absolute mess.In fact, before this, there have been similar idol survival shows. But there has never been a precedent like this one \u2013 where the final debut night was so absurd and off-script. The little crown, the sign of the highest prestige of the show \u2013 was also given to a trainee who failed to debut, Jian Xingsui. It was a blatant show of face-slapping the crew.When the ranking was announced, some Jian Xingsui fans at the scene were even more unreconciled. Some of them even came with flowers in their hands. The trainees were training in a closed-off venue. They never had the opportunity to meet them personally. As this was the first time they ever saw him in person, they had so many things they wanted to say.They wanted to tell him, \u2018You\u2019ve worked really hard. Your songs are very good, we love it so much. We\u2019ve seen your grit and endless sleepless nights, your countless days of practice, your blood, your sweat\u2013\u2019\u2018You are worthy of the debut position.\u2019\u2018These are the flowers we gave you. Congratulations, you debuted today, Suisui.\u2019They wanted to see that the youth with low self-esteem on his first stage, who said he dared not pursue his dreams, could leave this hall as a debutant after sunrise. They wanted to see him walk on a bright, flowery path into his future. As his fans, they wanted to escort him along the way, through thick and thin, through every achievement and album release.But he didn\u2019t debut.He somehow failed.Maybe\u2026 they would never see each other again. That lonely and unknown boy would return to being an unknown entity in this cruel, callous industry. The program crew seems to have slapped them hard, leaving everyone speechless for a long time.The camera cuts to the fans in the first row. The young lady holding the flowers was crying, fat droplets of tears rolled down freely. She covered her lips and tried her best not to make a sound. The tears fell on the flowers, heartbroken.The barrage in the live broadcast room also exploded:[Why?][Ahhhh, why!]Jian Xingsui was wearing two small crowns, standing still beside the podium. He opened his arms, gave Ning Ze a hug as he patted the older man\u2019s back in a comforting gesture. In a chalky, low voice, he said, \u201cCongratulations, Ze-ge.\u201dNing Ze hugged Jian Xingsui tightly, his eyes flushed red.This man was always taciturn. When he woke up early in the morning, he would fetch water for his roommates in advance. When he came back at night, he would also take care of his friends who have cramps from dancing and help them stretch. He had never been very eloquent with his words. But at this moment, in front of Jian Xingsui, his eyes were red, and his voice was trembling, \u201cYou\u2026 you have to keep performing on the stage. You belong on the stage. Don\u2019t give up your music. I want to hear it again.\u201dJian Xingsui froze.Ning Ze didn\u2019t like to talk, preferring actions over words. But he understood everyone very well. He knew that some failures are difficult for a person to overcome. He was afraid that Jian Xingsui would give up the stage from now on.\u201cPlease, don\u2019t give up.\u201d Ning Ze repeated this sentence clumsily. With a tall stature and solid muscle, this bronze-skinned boy usually looked very stable. Tonight, with tears rolling down his cheeks, he no longer gave that impression. Unable to let go of his younger brother, he patted Jian Xingsui on the back, a little choked up, \u201cYou are very good, you have done a good job, you have worked very hard, I know this very, very well.\u201dAt this moment, Jian Xingsui couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. The emotions he bottled up deep inside had burst out. His lips trembled slightly, the last bastion before the dam breaks. One sob, one choked breath, and then, it followed with a loud cry.The youth who has been enduring grievances\u2026 would probably be fine without any external comfort. But the moment he felt this warmth enveloping his body, it felt safe. It\u2019s safe enough for him to air out his grievances. And once it\u2019s out, it\u2019s out of his control.Too many people in the audience were emotionally infected, and finally couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.A girl stood up in the crowd, and used all of her power to shout, \u201cSuisui, don\u2019t cry.\u201dAfter someone took the lead, the others also stood up:\u201cDon\u2019t cry, you are the best!\u201d\u201cWe will continue to support you!\u201d\u201cYou performed really well today!!\u201dMore and more people followed suit. Their combined voice was getting louder, and their restlessness made the security guards of the program group unable to sit still. They came to control the situation, but they still couldn\u2019t stop the girls\u2019 words. Even the audience in the live broadcast followed soon. The barrage was filled with too many words, covering the entire screen until it felt like it could burst.At the same time, the Weibo hot search list was updated.#StarlightDebutNight##StarlightDebutListExposed##JianXingsuiShouldDebut#The third hot search surpassed the other two in just ten minutes, and it reached the top of today\u2019s hot search list in no time. A large number of netizens were attracted by the hot search out of pure curiosity. Then, they followed the news to the live broadcast room, where they saw noisy and chaotic images at the scene.With the list of debuted trainees, the official Weibo of \u201cStarlight\u201d was also updated. This was a Weibo post celebrating the formation of the boy group: \u201c\u2018Starlight\u2019 came to a successful conclusion tonight, the boy group is officially established. Let\u2019s celebrate the success of the following trainees who made their debut\u2026\u201dUnder that post, he number one hot comment got 100,000 likes in a few minutes\u2013[Director of the Brain Disease Association1clarity: the display name was mocking the show for being brainless basically.]: \u201cHello.\u201dBelow the that comment, there were angry fans and viewers who feel aggrieved:[He was still fifth when the final ranking had two hours left!][How did this happen?][We have worked hard for two or three months, is this the end?][Suisui must be so confused now\u2026]And amidst these comments, of course, there would be some fans of the debut trainee\u2019s fans celebrating their bias\u2019 debut. Among them, Shen Xingchen debuted as the center, and no-one had anything bad to say about him. In contrast, the most eye-catching group of people was of course Anran\u2019s fans.As a popular participant, Anran had a huge fanbase. In celebration, their display name were filled with happy emojis, and their post were also decorated by various reaction images and flower emoticons.[Congratulations to Anran for making his debut in third place. Anran\u2019s path to stardom is magnanimous, and his future will be flowery~~]Of course, this type of comments were to be expected. No one can certainly blame the fans for such comments celebrating their bias\u2019 success.But the problem was that the front row of hot comments were all questioning and insulting the program group. Some fans were sick of the unharmonious insults, so one of them decided to directly type under the comment questioning why Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t debut: [Excuse me, but congratulations to Anran for his debut at the third place! Anran has a promising star path and a promising future~~]After someone took the lead, more and more people dared to copy this behavior.Jian Xingsui\u2019s fans were usually Buddhist all year around. But they were really stimulated tonight. They were originally asking the program group to seek justice, or else they would be angry. When they opened the reply, they saw blessings for Anran\u2019s debut. The words floated under their harsh comments invited a strong sense of tonal whiplash. It\u2019s very easy to stoke an ember, and the seemingly-innocent comment felt so glaring, so provocative\u2026 so hateful. [peaceful, non-confrontational.]No matter how good-tempered people normally were, they were only humans. They could be offended and pissed off. In the end, many people are so stimulated they reply directly to Anran\u2019s rude fans:[Do you think it\u2019s appropriate for you to be in our comments?][Why can you just make your own building2comment thread?][Your behavior is so ugly.][Let\u2019s not bother each other. You do you, I\u2019ll do anything I want. If you want to celebrate, please go and celebrate by yourself!]Anran\u2019s fans felt aggrieved by the sudden firepower, some people also started to fight back and replied:[I\u2019m just borrowing a building to celebrate, why are you being so hostile? Did you pay for this? No?][If you\u2019re angry, apologize to my sister. It\u2019s understandable that your bias didn\u2019t make a debut. Being so fierce really scared me (wiping sweat)][There are still many trainees who haven\u2019t made their debut. If they don\u2019t have the strength and votes, they won\u2019t make their debut. Why is it up to you to decide who\u2019s worthy or not?][I\u2019m really speechless with this behavior, So you won\u2019t let others celebrate when you bias didn\u2019t make his debut?]Some people purposely aimed their replies like knives to poke people\u2019s sore spots.Many Jian Xingsui fans saw these words, their furious hair was on fire, and they were wronged and angry. To their surprise, the addition of another fanclub changed the situation. Shen Xingchen\u2019s fans have always been relatively fierce in firepower, both in fighting ability and solidarity. They felt compelled to help Jian Xingsui\u2019s fans fight back because they saw their bias cry on stage because his brother was bullied by the program group. However, they chose to be sarcastic instead:[Hey, hey, hey let me check, such a happy celebration, is Anran the first trainee who debuted as the center?][He just got third place and you dared to have this size of an ego?][Hahaha , Haven\u2019t you won a ranking in this life, Xiao San3this is a pun, as Xiao San / little three is also a slang term for a \u201cmistress\u201d aka a woman that a married man cheated with.?][Like idol, like fans, I guess~][This is so hilarious, I\u2019m dying of laughter. Yeah yeah yeah, his future sure is promising~]As the fans of the first ranked trainee, they are tough when they speak, and they also handle Anran\u2019s fans\u2019 weaknesses easily. Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth \u2013 seeing Anran\u2019s fans stabbing Jian Xingsui\u2019s fans in their Achilles\u2019 Heel, Shen Xingchen\u2019s fans decided to return the favor. In the end, the Weibo comment area suddenly became a battlefield.The director\u2019s team backstage was also flustered, and the assistant director\u2019s head was sweating, \u201cDirector, what should we do? Weibo and various media seem to have a lot of negative news.\u201dThe director himself also panicked. He didn\u2019t expect the audience\u2019s reaction to be so intense, he hesitated and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, these people should just make trouble for a while. Nothing will happen if we let it simmer for a while. Our live broadcast is still going on. Now the most important thing is to end this final night first.\u201dThe assistant director felt that he had an ominous premonition, but he couldn\u2019t say anything.However, just when everyone in the program group wanted things to settle down, at 10:59 that night, the live broadcast of \u201cStarlight\u201d was accompanied by the barrage and influx of a large number of users. The huge flow of people was paralyzed the network!#StarlightShowBroadcastCrash#This hot search hit the top of the hot topic list in less than 10 minutes. Because a contestant didn\u2019t make his debut, the platform was forced to suspend the live broadcast. Tonight \u201cStarlight\u201d debut night directly became the butt of the joke in the industry.The assistant director became even more anxious after learning about the situation: \u201cDirector, what should we do now?\u201dAfter realizing the suspension of the live broadcast, the director cursed a few times inwardly, and immediately said: \u201cThe live broadcast was forced to stop. Let the cameramen prepare. We will record first then broadcast later. No matter what, we must finish the final debut night. As for Weibo, we will publicly express our position and make the votes of the contestants open and transparent. Just tell them about our fairness and impartiality.\u201dThey did manipulate the votes.But as long as the overwhelming vote numbers were announced, and fans believe that Jian Xingsui\u2019s votes are indeed low, it\u2019s enough. Anyway, they need to restore the image first. So long the true number will never surface, they are safe.These directors thought they planned well. However, they didn\u2019t expect things would just get uglier. In the end, this decision became the thing they regretted the most.If I was JXS\u2019 fans and I saw those AR\u2019s fans comments\u2026 One bloodbath won\u2019t be enough, just saying :)))If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1clarity: the display name was mocking the show for being brainless basically.2comment thread3this is a pun, as Xiao San / little three is also a slang term for a \u201cmistress\u201d aka a woman that a married man cheated with.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We have a bonus chapter today~Next goal to bonus chapter (1/2)At 11 o\u2019clock in the night, when Weibo was in chaos, the official blog of the \u201cStarlight\u201d, which received more than 100,000 comments, was finally updated.[Hello everyone, because of the technical problems of the live broadcast platform, we have no choice but to suspend it first. Our technicians are currently fixing the problems. In view of everyone\u2019s concern, the following is the breakdown of the votes of the top ten contestants. We uphold a fair and just attitude towards each contestant. We hope that all of them will have a bright future.]The number of votes was open and transparent, so everyone could see it.First place Shen Xingchen: 9.80 million votesSecond place Li Xu\u2019an: 7.62 million votesThird place Jian Anran: 6.3 million votesFourth place\u2026\u2026Sixth place Ning Ze: 4.62 million votesSeventh place Jian Xingsui: 4.41 million votes.This vote count was supposed to calm the discourse happening, so people would stop accusing the program about voting manipulation. But it became counterattack weapon of Anran\u2019s fans, and there were a lot of snide under the comment section:[If you don\u2019t have enough votes , you shouldn\u2019t be debuting.][You don\u2019t have enough money to buy votes? Then don\u2019t lash out at innocent parties, poor bastards.][Bunch of incompetent fans are being furious for no reason.][You shouldn\u2019t blame the crew for not having enough popularity.]Although not all of them said these things, a bunch of Anran\u2019s fans wrote that as a venting method \u2013 they wanted to celebrate their winning, but were suppressed. As for Shen Xingchen\u2019s fans, they were frantically looking for a sense of presence here. With these many diverging opinions, they were looking for another round of fight. In the end, the fandom war continued on.Another ten minutes passed, and the live broadcast platform urgently repaired the network problem. Finally, the live broadcast worked again.The contestants on the podium have gone down, only the instructor and the host are left.Now it has basically come to the end of the show. Originally, the instructors would watch the students graduate, and they should all be smiling while sending them off. But the instructors standing on the stage basically did not have a smile on their faces, and they were all serious.Instructor Li just got a new list, and the director\u2019s voice came from his in-ear, saying that this list must not be read for now. The public must not know, lest another controversy about the show would start again.Truthfully, he was a little hesitant. If this list wasn\u2019t read, he felt it would be unfair \u2013 this would be equal to fooling the public, especially since they need to pay to get extra votes. In his hesitation, he slowly glanced at Fu Jinxiao. For the time being, he didn\u2019t have the strength to fight against the program group, but there was one person who could ignore the rules, it just depended on whether he was willing or not.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dInstructor Li didn\u2019t dare to be too obvious, but just hinted by shaking the list in his hand.Fu Jinxiao was smart enough to understand this cryptic gesture. This new list must be withdrawn and the director would not allow it to be read publicly. If this was the past, Actor Fu would be too lazy to meddle in such nosy matters, but today he was in a bad mood. Without thinking too much about it, the man stretched out his hand, \u201cGive it to me.\u201dA triumphant smile flashed across Instructor Li\u2019s eyes, and he handed the list to Fu Jinxiao.Fu Jinxiao took a glance, raised his head to face the cameramen and the audience. Without a hint of doubt, he casually spoke, \u201cNow we announce the voting results of the Octopus Live app and the Little Sun Live app special voting channel. From 7:00 to 10:30 tonight, the online audience\u2019s top three most popular contestants have come out. Third place winner is Shen Xingchen, second place winner is Anran, and the first place winner is\u2026\u201dThe scene fell into a brief silence.Under the spotlight, Fu Jinxiao\u2019s eyes met the audience. He opened his lips lightly, and read out the name after a dramatic silence, \u201cJian Xingsui.\u201dThe audience was in an uproar.The trainee who failed to debut actually was the most popular contestant in two different voting channels. With such high popularity, he must\u2019ve gained a lot of votes, right\u2026?Jian Xingsui, who was named, froze in place, and even he couldn\u2019t believe what he heard.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice was deep and magnetic, and his eyes were dark with unfathomable emotions. He looked at the young man with unspoken meaning, \u201cCongratulations to you, Jian Xingsui, you will become the first spokesperson of the Octopus Live app and the Little Sun Live app.\u201dFor the actor, this was just giving Jian Xingsui the glory he deserved.Once again, the live broadcast room exploded:[He received more than 7 million votes from the live broadcast platform tonight.][He is popular.][How the fuck is the calculation made? His final ranking said he had 4 million, but on the app he had 7 million??]At the same time, Anran\u2019s fans were still going at it to spread their version of truth. The more they talk, the more audacious they become. Many of the Weibo posts they made began to have some strange connotations. They said that Jian Xingsui\u2019s popularity wasn\u2019t as good as Anran\u2019s. Or that his fans were too toxic or evil.But with this shocking revelation. They soon became silent.In fact, this matter didn\u2019t have anything to do with them \u2013 they were Anran\u2019s fans, after all. Theoretically, whether or not he debuted shouldn\u2019t clash with Jian Xingsui\u2019s total number of votes. But since they got carried on lashing out, they aroused public outrage.Thanks to this vote count, it solidified Jian Xingsui\u2019s massive popularity. It revitalized his fans\u2019 vigor, and now they have more confidence to fight back.After being ridiculed for having no money, being incompetent, and furious, the original Buddhist support club became explosive.At midnight, Jian Xingsui\u2019s official fanclub was still full of excitement. No one can sleep tonight. After counting, the total money spent for buying the voting ticket was around 3.8 million yuan. With this amount of money, they could buy around 4 million votes. When this data came out, everyone was shocked:[\u201cStarlight\u201d, are you happy with this?][Just how much money is lost? How do you explain this?][We just want justice. We didn\u2019t block anyone\u2019s way. Is that wrong?][I remembered that live broadcast during the mountain climbing segment. Didn\u2019t Suisui tell us to stop buying votes for him? Knowing this would happen to us made me cry until I collapsed\u2026][Did he already know what will happen today, but he has to endure it alone for so long?]Originally, everyone was looking for things about the program group. But after seeing the number of actual votes, they started to count other participants\u2019 votes too \u2013 and remembering their previous grievance with Anran\u2019s fans, they zeroed in to his votes. They saw that his fanclub counted the total of voting tickets they bought, which was more than 3 million votes. This number was similar to Jian Xingsui\u2019s, but his final total was 6 million votes. Seeing this discrepancy, they went mad. If this logic was applied to Jian Xingsui\u2019s votes, wouldn\u2019t Suisui\u2019s votes crushed Anran\u2019s to death?In the end, the wronged person couldn\u2019t even settle their anger. While the supposed \u201cvictor\u201d gloated despite this perceived injustice.If their previous anger could be described as an erupting volcano, their anger now was akin to a supernova explosion.[So why is Anran he third?][Actually, not many of my friends like him.][I always think he is a very two-faced person. Nobody in this industry could be that innocent.][I have long wanted to say this outloud: doesn\u2019t anyone think he loves to play with his money and connection? Does he think of himself as the emperor or something?][Essence of green tea1(two-faced bitch basically.), indeed.]If Anran\u2019s fans didn\u2019t make that incident, maybe no one would notice, but it was precisely because of their ugly behavior that suddenly pushed Anran to the spotlight. At first, other trainees\u2019 fans didn\u2019t want to join in the discourse, but seeing this kind of blatant voting manipulation, they couldn\u2019t help but think that other trainees\u2019 votes might also be manipulated.Normally, this was a good day for Anran, as the netizens would celebrate his successful debut in the group. There shouldn\u2019t be much negative news about him. But thanks to his fans, the netizens who were disgusted by the fans also became wary of the idol. The accusation of him being a \u201croyal family\u201d also began to spread. They said that he used his back-door capital to get his position. Beneath his fairy persona, he was playing dirty.When Anran got his phone back, he wanted to get blessings from passersby and his fans. However, as soon as he opened his Weibo, he was instead greeted by many scoldings. Various accusations of him playing unfair were thrown to his face. Many netizens said that he used his family connections to win a high ranking. Truthfully, Anran was very confused.Careful netizens discovered that the trainees who debuted have begun to change their display names and avatars, and the format is unified: star\u2014Li Xu\u2019an, star\u2014Ning Ze, star\u2014Jian Anran\u2026 However, Shen Xingchen\u2019s avatar \u2013 the first ranked member \u2013 hasn\u2019t changed. On top of that, Li Xu\u2019an and Anran have already started to interact with each other, only Shen Xingchen and Ning Ze did not pay attention to other people.Although this was against some-kind of unspoken rules, Shen Xingchen\u2019s fans supported this attitude:[We are unique!][It\u2019s good that he changed nothing. It\u2019s easier when the group disbanded.]The official \u201cStarlight\u201d Weibo also released a graduation photo of the six debutants together. However, the center-position Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t smile alongside everyone. Instead, he was expressionless, as if he was kidnapped and forced to be here. Those who didn\u2019t know about this probably would\u2019ve thought that he was one of the eliminated trainees instead. Again, other debutants unifiedly commented and reposted this Weibo, but Shen Xingchen and Ning Ze didn\u2019t follow suit.For gossip-mongers, tonight was a sleepless night with much excitement. They dare not sleep, as they were afraid they would miss a fresh new tea if they fell asleep. Someone even brave enough to say that this group photo was of a funeral scene, especially since the center position had a very clear position \u2013 he was against the debut lineup, or at least against the program team. This melon2gossip was enough to fuel the netizens to jump up and down all night, their feet didn\u2019t touch the ground at all.The following hour, Shen Xingchen posted on Weibo. Many people was excited by this news.[Shen Xingchen v]: We have graduated, Goodbye Starlight. @JianXingsui @NingZeThe post also included no group photos at all. He posted other photos, which was a photo of the three dormitory groups. There were suitcases beside them. Jian Xingsui was sitting in the middle of the suitcase, while Shen Xingchen stood beside him leaning on his shoulder, looking like a big brother. As for Ning Ze, he stood next to him, bent down and made a peace sign while pressing the shutter.Both the caption and the photos make people want to laugh:[Bye bye, the next one will be better.][As expected of you, Xingchen-ge.][Seeing this, I thought it was just the three of you lol.][Let Suisui stand in the center, the elder brothers dote on the younger brother.]Before this, only Shen Xingchen and Ning Ze had Weibo, and Jian Xingsui had never opened Weibo. After finding this post, the netizen found Jian Xingsui along the way. Not surprisingly, this was indeed a brand-new account, and there were only a few initial fans following him. He followed Shen Xingchen and Ning Ze, and several instructors of \u201cstarlight\u201d. As for his post, he also only has one post \u2013 it was of this same photo, but the caption was slightly different from Shen Xingchen\u2019s.[Jian Xingsui]: I officially graduated today. I would like to thank the fans who met and supported me along the way, and I also thank the instructors who gave me help and guidance. This show has given me many unforgettable memories, and I have become a much better person because of it. I met many good brothers and friends. These short three months have passed in a blink, but all good things must come to an end. Goodbye, \u201cStarlight\u201d.In the comment section, many fans posted comforting words:[Come again next year! We\u2019ll support you!][Even if you are discouraged, we will still walk alongside you.][If you don\u2019t debut in a group, you will still have a bright future!]As for his anti-fans, they left sarcastic comments:[It may not be good even if he debuted. With that kind of skill, he still won\u2019t get any resources~][For an amateur like you, failing to debut spells the end of your career.][You might be popular now, but I bet by next month, nobody will remember you.][Besides, he was popular because he was tied to a CP with Fu-ge. Besides that, what else could he be popular for?]This kind of comment stemmed from the fact Jian Xingsui also @ Fu Jinxiao alongside Shen Xingchen and Ning Ze.But the thing was, most of the trainees would thank the instructor when writing this kind of thank-you post. This was normal operations. Li Xu\u2019an and Anran also did this. Generally, more capable trainees would get a reply from the instructors. For example, Li Xu\u2019an got a thumbs up from Instructor Li, and Tuya has also interacted with many other contestants. Many of the instructors were polite enough to respond with affection.That is, excluding Fu Jinxiao.Many trainees, including the popular one, also mentioned Movie Emperor Fu. But they didn\u2019t get a peep.Many fans speculated:[Fu-ge didn\u2019t go on Weibo tonight.][Well, it\u2019s to be expected.][He doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly close to any player?]In fact, everyone was used to it. As a figure on the the peak of stardom, he was usually too busy to follow this kind of operation. But many of the trainees still tried it anyway. It was no loss if they got ignored, but\u2026 if they somehow got noticed, it would be a huge hit.Unfortunately, everyone flopped. Just when everyone thought that tonight might pass peacefully and there would be no more waves\u20132:10 in the morning.People were drowsy, but this piece of news instantly woke them up, like an ice-cold bath.Out of nowhere, Fu Jinxiao paid attention to Jian Xingsui\u2019s Weibo post.1(two-faced bitch basically.)2gossipPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hopefully by April, I can go back to normal schedule.Weibo seems to be ignited by Fu Jinxiao.Netizens exploded again, including Jian Xingsui, who couldn\u2019t believe it when he saw the news. He stood there as if struck by lightning, mouth gaping wide enough for an insect to fly in.Shen Xingchen was still complaining in his ear: \u201cHow can Fu-ge have that level double-standard?? He didn\u2019t pay attention to me!\u201dNing Ze pursed his lips and smiled.Although he was not good at words, he could see through many things. In fact, he has long noticed that Fu Jinxiao was giving Jian Xingsui special attention. It was really no surprise that Fu-ge would pay attention to him and only him.Jian Xingsui was still holding his phone, his hands trembling with excitement.Shen Xingchen also noticed that something was wrong with him, \u201cBrother, although I can understand you, are you really so shocked?\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s chest rose and fell, and maybe he didn\u2019t understand his feelings at the moment. A lonely and nameless little fan, he left his footprints on Fu Jinxiao\u2019s Weibo. He has been a silent supporter for so long. He was used to never getting noticed back by his idol. He never thought that the day where his post was replied would come.Shen Xingchen\u2019s voice was still in his ears: \u201cAre you stupid?!\u201dJian Xingsui came back to his senses, he withdrew from his thoughts, and when he looked up, he met Shen Xingchen\u2019s red, puffed-up eyes. The young master kept his willful tone as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, are you still sad?\u201dJian Xingsui shook his head quickly, he even took a screenshot of the page he was on and saved it. Then he smiled and replied softly, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sad. I\u2019m so happy\u2026\u201dShen Xingchen was puzzled: \u201cAre you telling the truth?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded fiercely: \u201cI swear!\u201dA group of people were talking when a voice came from outside.Then, a tall man stood at the door of the dormitory. Shen Minglang frowned, and the majesty of the elder brother came out, \u201cShen Xingchen, how long are you going to dawdle? It is already three o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201dAfter being called, Shen Xingchen shrank his neck, \u201cWait a minute, I\u2019ll clean up first.\u201dJian Xingsui smiled softly.While packing up the last of the snacks from the cabinet, Shen Xingchen asked, \u201cSuisui, is there no one at your house this time?\u201dJian Xingsui held the suitcase tightly and nodded slightly : \u201cWell, I previously said I have something to do, but now\u2026 well, to answer your question, yes.\u201dFor the finale, almost all of the trainee\u2019s family members watched live in the audience. Only Mr. Zhang and his wife didn\u2019t come. Their excuse was that something happened in the store so they couldn\u2019t come, and Jian Xingsui no longer cared much. If they didn\u2019t come, he wouldn\u2019t make a fuss. Maybe\u2026 when people get used to disappointment, they would eventually learn to lower their expectations.In the past, he would feel lost and sad because he was looking forward to a scrap of familial love but not getting it. But now, there were no waves in his heart, and he would no longer be sad.Shen Xingchen asked suspiciously: \u201cThen where are you going now?\u201dJian Xingsui: \u201cI\u2026\u201dThis question stopped him.The company had a deadlock with him because of the one million yuan deal. Originally, he moved out of the rice cake shop and lived in the company\u2019s dormitory. Now he couldn\u2019t go back to the dormitory, and of course he didn\u2019t want to go back home.\u201cI\u2019ll go out later and find a hotel to rest.\u201d Jian Xingsui said, \u201cThere should be some nearby.\u201dShen Xingchen said, \u201cAre you going to stay in a hotel?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded honestly: \u201cYes.\u201dShen Xingchen questioned his soul: \u201cDo you even have the money to pay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui fell silent!Originally, he came to participate in \u201cStarlight\u201d because he had no money. He was aiming to get the 20,000 yuan consolation prize. The problem now was that he had already entered the finals, so the consolation money for the preliminary competition was naturally gone. Inside his mobile phone, his Alipay account only had around 1,000 yuan left, which was the salary he got from his part-time work for the show.Jian Xingsui said hesitantly: \u201cI think, if it\u2019s not a very expensive hotel, I can still afford it. Do you know where there is a cheap hotel nearby?\u201dShen Xingchen laughed out loud.Jian Xingsui blushed a little when he laughed.But Shen Xingchen came over and put one hand on Jian Xingsui\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cDon\u2019t go to the hotel, come to my house.\u201dJian Xingsui was stunned: \u201cHuh?\u201dWith a confident look, Shen Xingchen continued, \u201cYou can come to my house for two days to rest, and you can leave after you find a suitable accommodation.\u201dGrowing up, Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t have many sincere friends. He went to other people\u2019s houses as a guest, and has never received the honor of a good relationship like staying overnight. Because of this, when he heard Shen Xingchen\u2019s offer, he was naturally overjoyed, flattered, and panicking. As he was worried, he asked, \u201cAh, is this okay? Won\u2019t I be too disturbing? You should also get together with your family when you go home. If I\u2019m here, will you\u2026\u201dShen Xingchen cut the younger man impatiently: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to disturb, and if there\u2019s any, you wouldn\u2019t disturb us, trust me. I have many rooms in my house, and you are my little brother. Hey, if I can\u2019t even help with this little thing, how can I be your big brother in the future!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe corners of Jian Xingsui\u2019s mouth twitched.Shen Minglang\u2019s words came from the side, clearly approving, \u201cXingchen is right, you two are good friends. There is nothing wrong with helping you out with your difficulties. If you want, you can come to our house as a guest, we all welcome you.\u201dJian Xingsui turned around in surprise, since the eldest brother had spoken, it would be shameful for him to take back his words. And in fact\u2026 he was happy in his heart.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Jian Xingsui took a deep breath. He stood up a little straighter, smiled at Shen Xingchen, then turned around and bowed deeply to Shen Minglang, \u201cThank you, I\u2019ll make sure I won\u2019t be a bother.\u201dShen Minglang had affection for this polite young man.Compared to his monkey of a little brother, Jian Xingsui was the kind of younger brother he wished he had. Maybe, the polite boy\u2019s humbleness and demeanor could rub into Shen Xingchen. That would be able to save half of his worries.Shen Xingchen asked Ning Ze, \u201cZe-ge, what about you?\u201dNing Ze replied, \u201cMy company has come to pick me up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Shen Xingchen was not worried about Ning Ze, \u201cThen let\u2019s go out first. It\u2019s getting late.\u201dThe others nodded in agreement.Carrying suitcases through the corridors, through rows of dormitory doors, familiar roads and white corridor lights, all of which have burned into their memories. During training, they usually moaned about how tired they felt and how they are very much looking forward for the graduation. But after that happened, all they wanted was for the show to go on a bit longer.The moment they stepped out of this building, they were officially no longer trainees. A farewell to the venue, a farewell to their friends, a farewell to their past.As they walked downstairs, nobody spoke.There were many trainees on the back building\u2019s stairway, busy with the last bit of interaction they could have in this building. When the four of them separated from Ning Ze at the edge of the parking lot, Shen Xingchen was the first to call out, \u201cMom, Fu-ge!\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s first reaction after hearing the shout was being shocked. He then looked up and sure enough, he saw the very familiar slender, handsome and elegant man standing beside the nanny car not far away. The Film King was talking to Xu Enzhen with a smile. Obviously it was Shen Xingchen who called to him, but his eyes landed on Jian Xingsui instead. [a designated van for celebrities.]The four eyes were facing each other, locked in a gaze for quite some time.Shen Xingchen, with his rough demeanor, was irritated that Fu Jinxiao ignored him. With swagger, he walked over and cursed, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you pay attention to me?\u201dFu Jinxiao had his usual kind smile on his face, and opened his lips to answer is a light tone, \u201cYou need me to pay attention to you when you debut at the center position? Still need to rub into my heat1rubbing heat = leeching fame?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d Shen Xingchen\u2019s self-confidence was at the peak, and he immediately turned his nose up, and snorted proudly, \u201cI have my own heat.\u201dFu Jinxiao side-eyed him. Not long after, his dark eyes fell on Jian Xingsui who stood beside the haughty young master.Jian Xingsui was also looking at him.Rubbing heat\u2026Did Fu-ge let Jian Xingsui rub his heat?Artists in the entertainment industry hated this kind of operation. And Fu Jinxiao was no exception.Jian Xingsui was nervous and expectant at the bottom of his heart. He watched Fu Jinxiao and wanted to speak a thousand words but didn\u2019t know where to start. Finally, he just stood there stupidly.Fu Jinxiao chuckled: \u201cI\u2019m leaving, don\u2019t you have anything to say to me?\u201dJian Xingsui panicked, and fumbled over his words, \u201cYes, yes!\u201dWith explicit permission, Jian Xingsui finally was able to say what he had been holding back in his heart since the beginning, \u201cThank you, thank you for following me on Weibo.\u201dObviously there were more complicated, unsaid things in his heart. But the words were stuck inside his throat, choking him up and making him mum.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows: \u201cNo more?\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t expect that there would be a second chance. He put the suitcase beside him, held it tight, and bowed deeply to Fu Jinxiao. With a trembling voice, he said slowly, \u201cThank you for being such a good mentor to me. I will remember this kindness for the rest of my life!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao was rarely at a loss for words.He was just teasing this silly boy, and may be fishing for a compliment or two. He didn\u2019t expect this level of sincerity, giving him a grand gesture of thankfulness. A warm feeling built up in his chest, making him confused on whether he wanted to cry or laugh.\u201cYou really appreciate me so much?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded heavily, his eyes were always clean and sincere, but when he looked at a person, his emotions were all written on his face. Fu Jinxiao didn\u2019t need a verbal confirmation, he already knew what the youth wanted to say to him.For a moment, Fu Jinxiao seemed to suddenly understand why his eyes fell on Jian Xingsui unconsciously. Perhaps it was because the big dye vat in the entertainment circle had been there for a long time, and he hadn\u2019t seen a woman who was too clean for a long time. The child, or him, who was originally in the dark, will always unconsciously look towards the bright and open place.Fu Jinxiao took out a business card from his pocket and put it in Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand.Jian Xingsui took the card and looked up suspiciously: \u201cThis is?\u201d\u201cMy business card. It has my phone number on it, and also my WeChat contact.\u201d Fu Jinxiao pointed at the business card in his palm, curling his lips up, \u201d Since I will remember your words for the rest of my life\u2026 remember to keep in touch with me.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s eyes slowly widened, and after his brain received these words, little fireworks exploded in his heart.Frequent contact\u2026Personal business card\u2026He held the business card, nodded in response, and even wanted to secretly pinch himself, for fear that this was a dream.Shen Xingchen who was next to him came over and said jokingly, \u201cBe happy, don\u2019t hold back, just laugh when you are happy. Why so shy? Many people would envy your position, being so close to Fu-ge. Just show off without shame sometimes, yeah?\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t expect such words coming out from this deceitful teammate of his. His earlobe was red, and he gave Shen Xingchen a look, a little flustered, and looked at Fu Jinxiao to explain.But Shen Xingchen pulled him and said, \u201cOkay, Fu-ge, let\u2019s get in the car first.\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows and didn\u2019t stop him.Xu Enzhen shook his head behind: \u201cThis child\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0 But it\u2019s getting late, so it\u2019s better to go back and rest earlier. I remember your greetings to my mother, and I will definitely help you. Let me know, I will definitely visit again someday.\u201dIn front of the elders, Actor Fu could always maintain a personable demeanor. He knew when to advance and when to retreat.Sure enough, Xu Enzhen smiled and said: \u201cOkay, okay, you too, go to bed early.\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded, and after sending Xu Enzhen to the car, he turned to look at Shen Minglang next to him, and said, \u201cTake them back early, I\u2019m going home too.\u201dShen Minglang pushed his glasses, \u201cIf only you can fulfill that marriage arrangement\u2026 my Mother would be so happy. She still regrets that you aren\u2019t our family\u2019s son-in-law.\u201dFu Jinxiao said slowly, \u201cTo be honest, I have no intention of getting married. I am not interested in men or women, let alone marriage. This kind of thing was arranged by the heavens, and it cannot be forced.\u201dShen Minglang shrugged noncommittally.In essence, both he and Fu Jinxiao were rational and cold-hearted people by nature, but Fu Jinxiao was not bound by the family business, so he was naturally more free. In fact, he was also curious about what kind of person would be able tame this big Buddha.If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1rubbing heat = leeching famePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as he got in the car, his agent\u2019s face was not very good. She asked him instead of greeting him, \u201cHave you seen what\u2019s happening on Weibo? Your fans are locked in a fandom war against Jian Xingsui\u2019s. The situation is not looking good.\u201dAnran\u2019s manager was a woman in her 30s, and people in the industry call her Li-jie.Li-jie was a chubby woman, she usually was very polite to Anran. However, today she was burdened by this incident, so she was more tired-looking. She sighed as she said, \u201cNot long ago, Young Master Jian1she\u2019s referring to Jian Zhi. asked me to contact Jian Xingsui and his agency. He spent one million yuan to make him withdraw from the competition. His agency agreed on the deal, and they received the money. But Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t withdraw from the competition. Up to now, the director has suppressed his votes and failed to let him make his debut. But now that this voting manipulation issue has surfaced\u2026 his influence on Weibo is just getting bigger.\u201dAfter hearing this, Anran was a little worried, \u201cThen what should I do? Li-jie, it\u2019s none of my business!\u201dLi-jie gave him a blank look, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s none of your business?\u201dThere\u2019s a reason why Anran\u2019s fans became rabid like that. Naturally, he had some level of influence on their behavior.Anran always followed the \u201cfairy boy\u201d type that his fans had designated for him. He often shared his day-to-day life with his fans. Even if his fans did some outrageous things, Anran would turn a blind eye, or just scold them lightly. It\u2019s one thing to not involve himself with his fans, but it\u2019s a whole different thing if he always tried to sway his fans to do something. If it wasn\u2019t because of his lax control on his fans, how could his fans grow to be so lawless?Anran hesitated and said, \u201cLi-jie, it\u2019s no one\u2019s business at this point. It\u2019s time to pursue responsibility. You have to think of a way, and you can\u2019t let them say that I am someone who is mired in nepotism!\u201dLi-jie sighed, \u201cThe biggest problem now is Jian Xingsui. In fact, as long as his limelight passes, this matter naturally will be buried. The netizens have a memory of a goldfish, they won\u2019t remember this controversy for long. Don\u2019t worry, I will put pressure on his agency tomorrow. They can\u2019t just eat that one million without giving us a benefit in return!\u201dAnran nodded reassuringly after hearing this.In fact,he himself was very aggrieved and didn\u2019t want to talk about anything else. No matter how bad the second half of his previous life was, at least he debuted as the center in this show. Although Shen Xingchen also participated at that time, this young master retired midway through the first two stages because he had a quarrel with his roommate. But in this life, he got along well with his roommates and Actor Fu, so he won the center position instead.Everything had changed so drastically.Why on earth did Shen Xingchen get along so well with Jian Xingsui? Thanks to that, his glory was stolen. Back then, when he won the first position, who would dare to question him making unscrupulous deals to get his position?Jian Xingsui, Jian Xingsui again, how come he always spoils his achievement\u2026Anran sat and thought for a long time. He finally made up his mind when he got out of the car. He decisively dialed Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s number. Without waiting for too long, he heard the middle-aged man\u2019s voice, \u201cHello, is this Ranran?\u201dAnran smiled, and said softly, \u201cFather.\u201dAlthough he had already returned to the Jiang family, he still called Zhang\u2019s couple that way in private.Hearing this familiar call, Zhang Xiangyang felt hot in his heart: \u201cRanran, your Mother and I saw that successfully debuted in that idol group. Congratulations, I know your hard work wouldn\u2019t be in vain. But\u2026 your Mother and I are very busy with something else, so we can go watch you in person during that final stage.\u201dAnran kept using his obedient child tone, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I know the difficulties of Mom and Dad.\u201dZhang Xiangyang then heaved a sigh of relief.But unexpectedly, Anran changed the subject and said, \u201cDad, there is something I want to ask you.\u201dZhang Xiangyang said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?Anran finally found a chance to ask, \u201cThere was one time when the program crew asked us to fill in personal data\u2026 Jian Xingsui asked me about your blood type. I\u2026 took a peek, and found out that his blood type is B. And I knew that both Mom\u2019s and your bloodtype is A. With that kind of difference\u2026 how could there be a blood relationship between you and him?\u201dZhang Xiangyang was stopped by this question. It would be better to say that at this moment, his blood was frozen, as if it had coagulated. In fact, as early as two days ago, when Jian Xingsui proposed to do the paternity test, he had thought that this matter might be exposed one day. He didn\u2019t expect that this moment would come so early.There was already a thin layer of sweat on Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s head, he hesitated and said, \u201cRanran, listen to my explanation, I\u2026\u201dBut Anran cut his explanation, \u201cMom and Dad, I believe in you. There should be some misunderstanding. I know that you two are good people, you have raised me all these years. I think you need to solve and deal with Jian Xingsui by yourself. However, Suisui\u2019s elimination this time has hit him hard. I think, if possible, you two can take him back to your hometown and develop there. I remember that the rent there is much cheaper than here. You can open up a store or something to support your livelihood. It should be pretty stable, no?\u201dZhang Xiangyang didn\u2019t react for a while.He slowed down and said, \u201cRanran, what do you mean? You haven\u2019t told Jian Xingsui our bloodtype yet?\u201dAnran smoothly lied as he smiled, \u201cNope. I think this is something you two should discuss with him. So I didn\u2019t make any claims.\u201dZhang Xiangyang was relieved and felt short of breath at the same time, so he could only say, \u201cI see\u2026 I understand, we will consider your suggestion, we will consider it\u2026\u201dWith that, Anran just hung up his phone.He was clever enough to have a vague guess about the truth of the matter. And this was precisely why he should nip the problem in the bud. If this matter was found out by the authorities and the Zhang couple ended up in prison, that was fine. What was not fine was that, there was a glimmer of chance that Jian Xingsui\u2019s biological family might be a powerful one.Even as a grassroot2someone without a relevant background. Grassroots are\u2026 you can think of it like duckweed, a floating plant with thin, weak roots. contestant, that filthy thing could shake his power in the entertainment industry. If he actually had a powerful background\u2026 that was just giving wings to a tiger3giving even more power to already powerful people.. He would choke Anran\u2019s career into nothingness.He got this once-in-a-lifetime chance of being reborn. He didn\u2019t want to waste this precious chance to become Jian Xingsui\u2019s stepping stone!He would make sure all threats were exterminated.Well, dead people wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything, would they?Meanwhile, in the Shen family\u2019s mansion\u2013This was Jian Xingsui\u2019s first time stepping inside the Shen family\u2019s home. He was floored with the grandeur of the whole thing. Compared to the Jian family\u2019s house, it was still comparing heaven and the earth.Shen Xingchen was still bemoaning as he rubbed his stomach, \u201cMom, I\u2019m really hungry, let the Auntie prepare some food!\u201dXu Enzhen would look at Jian Xingsui distractedly from time to time as she walked.For some reason, she always has an inexplicable sense of closeness to this child. When she learned that he had been wronged and failed to make his debut, it made her recall that day when she found him crying silently on the stairway. That child looked so helpless, and could only cry on his lonesome. He even had to push himself to wipe his tears and tidy up, more likely because he had no-one to share his troubles.He was just a twenty year old child, and yet, he had to bear his burden alone. As a mother, even if Jian Xingsui was not of her own blood, she felt sorry and wanted to coddle him.\u201cYou just know how to eat,\u201d Xu Enzhen glared at his son, then turned his head to Jian Xingsui with a gentle smile, \u201cHow about you, Xingsui, are you hungry?\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t expect Mrs. Shen to ask him, so he hesitated for a moment before nodding.Shen Xingchen yelled like a brat he actually was, \u201cI\u2019m hungry too, I\u2019m hungry too!\u201dXu Enzhen said, \u201cAs if you can starve to death. Be patient for a moment, would you?\u201dJian Xingsui dared not speak at the side, but Xu Enzhen approached him very intimately after getting out of the car. Beside him, the older lady said in a gentle voice, \u201cXingsui, what do you want to eat? Auntie will cook it for you.\u201dJian Xingsui was flattered, and answered in a shy voice, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I can eat anything.\u201dXu Enzhen shook her head in disapproval, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can tell Auntie what you want. You just finished a close-door training in that venue for three months. I know you are tired, and I also know that you haven\u2019t eaten much since yesterday. You can go wash up first, and leave everything else to Auntie. I will arrange it.\u201dListening to the gentle and kind voice from Mrs. Shen, Jian Xingsui felt hot and warm in his heart. It was the first time he visited a friend\u2019s house as a guest, and he was really afraid that he would offend his friend\u2019s family member. It made him overcautious and nervous. But Xu Enzhen was so kind to him, so he became braver and answered, \u201cThank you, Auntie.\u201d\u201cNo need to be polite to me,\u201d Xu Enzhen answered.Jian Xingsui nodded.The two had unusual harmonious feelings between them, like a picture-perfect example of a loving mother and her filial son. Shen Xingchen, who was standing behind them, stared in disbelief. He seemed dissatisfied but was not angry. He was just acting like a spoiled brat, \u201cMoooommm, I\u2019ve been enduring my starving stomach for several! Hours! Why can my younger brother get food, while me, your blood-related, very lovely son, cannot?\u201dXu Enzhen squinted and glanced at her bear son4naughty child., \u201cWhat can you not eat?\u201dShen Xingchen wailed dramatically, \u201cAre you actually my mother? Am I actually the child you picked up by the roadside? It seems like Jian Xingsui is your biological son instead!\u201dIf you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1she\u2019s referring to Jian Zhi.2someone without a relevant background.

We have five bonus chapters today!Next ko-fi goal to bonus chapter (1/2)This was the first time Jian Xingsui visited the Shen family\u2019s house.In his impression, it was very different from the Jian family\u2019s house. For example, there\u2019s several servants hired in Jian\u2019s house, while there\u2019s only one househelper employed in the Shen family\u2019s house. After entering, the living room wasn\u2019t typical \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a magnificent, grand room with many precious antiques , cold marble, and leather sofas, but it was instead a tidy and warm room. The house was painted with warm colors, and the furniture consisted mainly of wooden tables and chairs. There\u2019s a couple of hand-woven feather decorations on the walls and wall cabinets with books, bottles, and decorative flowers.On the far-left wall, there were a few crooked paintings hanging with some certificates \u2013 it seemed to be excellent education awards or something like that. There was also some handmade d\u00e9cor in the glass wooden cabinet. The sofa was made of white woven leather. There was a fluffy cushion, with a half-knit scarf and gloves lying on it. On the coffee table, there were two plates of fruit and a half-read book.The house was\u2026 warm and homey. Felt down-to-earth for a rich family like the Shen\u2019s.Shen Xingchen whispered from Jian Xingsui\u2019s side: \u201cHandicrafts is my Mother\u2019s hobby, sorry if it\u2019s currently messy around the house.\u201dJian Xingsui shook his head: \u201cNo, no problem.\u201dAn elderly woman came over, took the jackets of Shen Minglang and the others, and asked in a respectful manner, \u201cMadam, Young Masters, Sir just called and said that his plane was delayed, and something happened to the company. He said he will take another two days to come back.\u201dXu Enzhen said, \u201cThank you Auntie Wu. It\u2019s hard work for you, you haven\u2019t slept despite it being so late.\u201dAuntie Wu took a look at Jian Xingsui, and she politely said,\u00a0 \u201cYoung Master is coming back late today, and he must eat. It\u2019s only natural I also would stay up late to prepare food for him. I left it in the kitchen to keep it warm, go see if there\u2019s anything you want, I\u2019ll make more of it.\u201dXu Enzhen smiled and nodded. She turned her head and looked back at Jian Xingsui, \u201cXingsui, you and Xingchen go upstairs to find a room to rest and wash up. After that, go downstairs for dinner.\u201dShen Xingchen stretched his sore muscles, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m exhausted, let\u2019s go.\u201dXu Enzhen came over, she took Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand, and said softly, \u201cIf you need something, just tell me, okay?\u201dNo matter how many times it had happened, Jian Xingsui was still very touched by Mrs. Shen\u2019s kindness. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing. But still, thank you for your generous offer.\u201dXu Enzhen finally smiled with confidence.Jian Xingsui was dragged up the stairs by Shen Xingchen, only to find out that the second floor also had the same warm atmosphere. There were many paintings hanging on the wall of the stairs, most of which are photos of the two children of the Shen family growing up. There\u2019s also the whole family photos and the Shen couple by themselves. These photos seemed to be organized chronologically. However, there\u2019s a spot in the middle that seemed oddly empty.Jian Xingsui couldn\u2019t help but ask about it in curiosity.Shen Xingchen, who was walking next to him, knew what he was wondering at a glance, and said, \u201cAre you wondering why there\u2019s an empty spot here?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded.Shen Xingchen explained, \u201cBecause something happened to our family at that time. My Mother was pregnant with my younger brother when I was about three or four years old, but later, my younger brother died in the hospital.\u201d\u201cMy Mother had difficulties during her previous pregnancies. She even almost miscarried a couple of times during this one. And in the end\u2026 well, this cast a shadow on Mom that haunted her for several years. The baby was born during October. Mom said that at that time, she managed to see him and touched him one last time before losing him forever.\u201dThere was a little smile in Shen Xingchen\u2019s eyes and he said: \u201cYou know, once I heard from Mom that the baby was completely different from my elder brother or me. Other children would cry and their eyes should still be shut, but he didn\u2019t. After the nurse took him out, he opened his eyes, isn\u2019t it miraculous?\u201dJian Xingsui said: \u201cHow can there be such a thing? A newborn baby opens his eyes?\u201d\u201cYes, my Mother said that she was still on the operating table at that time, and the child opened his eyes. My Mother reached out to touch him, and he reached out to hold her finger. But later\u2026 the nurse said he suddenly died,\u201d Shen Xingchen scratched his head while talking, his eyes darkened, and continued in a low voice, \u201cMaybe Mom instinctively knew it would be the last time she would see him, so\u2026\u201dPerhaps, it was also because of that brief contact in the operating room that made her unable to move on. It\u2019s like a seed that fell into the tip of her heart, took root, germinated, and grew wildly.No matter what everyone and she told herself, let alone moving on, she couldn\u2019t even accept it.Even if it was just a hasty farewell, she couldn\u2019t accept the news that the child had suffered a sudden cardiac arrest. The heavy blow caused her to suffer from severe postpartum depression. No one noticed her abnormality at first, until one day she began to tell that she saw the hallucination of her dead son. After some counseling with a psychiatrist, she was judged to have severe mental problems.Shen Xingchen said while taking Jian Xingsui to the guest room, \u201cThe doctor said that my Mother was too sad and unwilling to face the reality. Those hallucinations are her body\u2019s self-protection mechanism, and only she kept believing it\u2019s not a mere delusion. But, how can a person come back to life after death? Although sometimes\u2026 I do wish I had a younger brother.\u201dJian Xingsui was curious: \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt would be nice to have a younger brother.\u201d Shen Xingchen said in an incomprehensible expression, \u201cMy ge scolds me every day when he has nothing to do, and so does Fu-ge. I know that his qualifications and knowledge are better than mine, so they have the privilege. But, if I also have a younger brother, I could do the same to him right? Give him life lessons and things like that. Isn\u2019t that awesome?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui couldn\u2019t refute.After arriving at the guest room, he began to take a shower.When he came out, he was wearing a bath towel. Not long after tidying up, there was a knock on the door. He hurried to open the door, and was surprised to see Auntie Wu standing outside.Auntie Wu bowed and said, \u201cHello, Mr. Jian.\u201dJian Xingsui quickly returned the greeting, \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cThis is what my Madam asked me to bring to you,\u201d Auntie Wu handed him the things in the tray, \u201cThis is Xingchen\u2019s old pajamas from two years ago. But they are all clean and comfortable. Also, Madam said that she didn\u2019t know your specific sleeping habits, so she prepared eye masks and earplugs for you if you needed it. By the way, this is\u2013\u201dThis level of care made Jian Xingsui dumbfounded.He knew his status \u2013 a guest, not to mention, someone who failed in his career. His family also was just a normal middle-income family. For a family like the noble Shen family, it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that he\u2019s just an ant in front of them. But everyone in the Shen family didn\u2019t look down on him, but they treated him with so much respect and care.Jian Xingsui took the things and was very grateful, \u201cThank you Auntie, give my thanks to Mrs. Shen also.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so polite.\u201d Auntie Wu smiled and said, \u201cI can see that you are a good friend of the Young Master, and the Madam likes you very much. You don\u2019t have to be cautious here, just tell me what you want.\u201dJian Xingsui couldn\u2019t treat her like a servant, and he bid her goodbye politely.After going back into the guest room, he changed into his pajamas, and then he went downstairs. When he got downstairs, he smelled a faint fragrance of food. Seeing Xu Enzhen serving noodles on the table downstairs, he hurried over, \u201cI can help.\u201dXu Enzhen was surprised when she saw him, \u201cYou\u2019re ready so soon?\u201dJian Xingsui smiled and said, \u201cI just need to pack up. It took no time at all. Are you serving noodles? Let me help.\u201dXu Enzhen cautioned him, \u201cThis is hot.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Jian Xingsui took the big bowl skillfully, then slowly put the noodles into the several smaller serving bowls with a spoon and chopsticks, \u201cI have helped in restaurants before, and the noodles there were rough and thick. Since this is very hot, you might want to stay a little farther, so as not to be splashed by the soup.\u201dXu Enzhen looked at Jian Xingsui serving the noodles, and when he was serving the noodles, he deliberately avoided adding the oil into the noodle soup, so she was curious, \u201cWhy? Are you afraid of getting fat, so you avoid eating the oil?\u201dJian Xingsui responded, \u201cNo, this bowl is for you. I think you must haven\u2019t eaten much since last night. So I thought of giving you a serving. As for avoiding adding oil to the noodle soup, it\u2019s because I think your skin is very well-maintained, so you shouldn\u2019t touch oily foods. Err, uhm\u2026 sorry, did I force my own decision on you..? I\u2019ll give you another serve again.\u201dXu Enzhen was slightly stunned at first. Then, she saw that Jian Xingsui really made another serving. The sensitive and careful behavior of this child made her feel a pain in her heart. She quickly stopped Jian Xingsui and took over the bowl in his hand. The bowl was hot, and her heart was warm. With a soft whisper, she told him, \u201cI don\u2019t take it as an offense. In fact, I\u2019m happy you are taking care of me with the little things you do.\u201dJian Xingsui relaxed his knotted heart. Seeing Xu Enzhen looking at him with a maternal smile, he stammered in response,\u201dI-It\u2019s nothing, This is\u2026 uh\u2026 This is what I should do.\u201dShe was so kind to him, of course he would want to do something for her.Jian Xingsui continued to serve the rice, and Auntie Wu, who was not far away, wanted to come over, but Xu Enzhen stopped her with her eyes. She just stood quietly, watching the boy doing things beside her. He now helped to set the chopsticks after serving the noodles. After he finished, he even wiped the spillage on the table with a rag.Xu Enzhen was not a stupid woman, she can see that Jian Xingsui was nervous when he came here. She had been trying to make him relax, but it looked like for this type of grateful child, it\u2019s better to let him do something to make him relax and not feel burdened.\u201cMom! Suisui! How are you all done already?\u201d Shen Xingchen\u2019s voice came from the stairs. He had just taken a shower, his hair hadn\u2019t been blown dry, so his usually spiky hair looked tamed and flat. With a spring on his steps, he trotted over, \u201cWow, today\u2019s dinner looks so luxurious! Mom, you actually cook the noodles yourself. Today\u2019s not a big day nor do we have distinguished guests, right? It\u2019s rare that we can eat these noodles.\u201dShen Xingchen smiled with a dopey look at Jian Xingsui, \u201cYou are blessed, my brother. Let me tell you, although my mother\u2019s cooking skills are not very good, her egg noodles are to die for! Plus, you can\u2019t eat them unless it\u2019s a special occasion, so that makes it extra, extra special!\u201dXu Enzhen gave him a blank look that promised pain for her bear child, \u201cYou really can talk so much, can\u2019t you?\u201dShe also shouted at her eldest son, telling Shen Minglang to hurry up and come down for dinner.At the dinner table, Shen Xingchen could be said to be wolfing down his food without a shred of manners. Jian Xingsui took a bite of the noodles and was amazed by the taste \u2013 the deliciousness of the soup, the springiness\u00a0 of the noodles\u2026 it\u2019s all perfect. While it might not be the most delicious noodles he ever tasted, it was full of warmth. He could taste the love Xu Enzhen poured while making it. In that case, it was the best food he ever ate.After eating a bowl, he actually wanted to have seconds, but he was embarrassed to stand up. He could only give longing looks to the big bowl of noodles not far away.\u00a0 After all, he\u2019s still only a guest. It\u2019s not a good look to be too presumptuous.Sitting opposite of him was Shen Minglang. The older man was wearing gold-rimmed glasses, and he had a perpetual stern face. With a serious tone, he called, \u201cAuntie Wu?\u201dAuntie Wu who was standing not far away came over: \u201cYes, Young Master?\u201d\u201cPlease give me another serving.\u201d Shen Minglang handed her his half-full bowl, and said casually: \u201cAh, also, they are all hungry too, so please fill up their bowl.\u201dThe elderly housekeeper nodded.Shen Xingchen also muttered while he kept eating, \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m starving to death.\u201dAuntie Wu came over to add some for Shen Minglang, and asked Jian Xingsui softly, \u201cYou seem to have finished eating, let me add some more.\u201dThis question was like a timely rain during the drought. Since he\u2019s asked first, he eagerly nodded. With a shy smile, he thanked the housekeeper, \u201cMhmm, thank you.\u201dAuntie Wu had a good impression of this polite child, and she could see that Jian Xingsui wasn\u2019t a gold digger by any means. Only sincerity could be repaid by sincerity. She was also very happy for the young master to make friends. After handing the bowl to him, she smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, there is still enough, my Madam has cooked a lot.\u201dShen Minglang on the opposite side took another look. He made sure the bashful youth had enough on his bowl, and then looked away.Xu Enzhen\u2019s eyes were also full of softness, and she said softly: \u201cSuisui, if you like to eat this, then you must come to play often. Auntie can cook for you anytime.\u201dShen Xingchen sensed this injustice and whined pitifully, \u201cMooomm! That\u2019s not what you said to me when I\u2019m hungry.\u201dShen Minglang refuted his whiny younger brother with cold-blooded words, \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re an absolute glutton without manners. It\u2019s good for you to eat less.\u201dShen Xingchen moaned to express his dissatisfaction.Jian Xingsui watched the family eating quietly, with a touch of envy in his heart. This family was really nice, and they talked and laughed during the meal. There was no such strict rule that you mustn\u2019t speak during meal times. The palpable familial warmth, the occasional bickering, but the intimacy\u2026 this was completely opposite to the atmosphere at Jian family\u2019s home.After eating, Shen Xingchen said: \u201cCome with me, I will take you to my room to see something amazing.\u201dJian Xingsui was dragged away by him.Xu Enzhen from behind called out, \u201cIt\u2019s past four o\u2019clock in the morning! You two, don\u2019t play too late! Shen Xingchen, if you don\u2019t sleep, that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s your body. But don\u2019t delay Xingsui\u2019s sleep, he is still growing!\u201dShen Xingchen, who was impatient, replied\u00a0 perfunctorily, \u201cI know, I know, Mom, you are so nagging!\u201dAfter going upstairs, Shen Xingchen brought Jian Xingsui to his room, which was even bigger than Jian Xingsui imagined. It\u2019s full of knick-knacks \u2013 be it the latest games, various posters, or action figurines. Despite being four o\u2019clock in the morning, Shen Xingchen was still excited as he spoke to Jian Xingsui, \u201cI\u2019ll show you my treasures!\u201dJust as Jian Xingsui was curious, he saw Shen Xingchen dragging out a large VR game pod from the cabinet, \u201cHurry up, this is a limited-edition game pod. Most people can\u2019t get it, you know. You can only buy it from a special channel, so no matter how much money you throw at the developer, there\u2019s no guarantee you can actually buy it! I couldn\u2019t get one back then, but thankfully, Fu-ge found a way to acquire one, and he gifted it to me for my birthday! Also, as for this one\u2014\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s pupils widened when he heard Fu Jinxiao\u2019s name.Shen Xingchen pulled him to show the game pod\u2019s monitor, \u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll show you the functions\u2026\u201dWhen Xu Enzhen came to check her youngest son\u2019s room half an hour later, she saw two young men sleeping side-by-side on the carpet. There were many of Shen Xingchen\u2019s prized possessions scattered about. It\u2019s clear that the young master wanted to show them to his close friend.Xu Enzhen sighed softly, and she took a blanket from the side to cover Jian Xingsui.Shen Xingchen was lying on the ground on his back, sleeping with a soft snore. Jian Xingsui was sleeping next to him, curled up like a baby. The profiles of the two people were so similar under the dim light, which made Xu Enzhen feel a little dazed, as if these two people were supposed to be like this in the first place.Like close brothers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He picked it up, and unexpectedly found that the call was from the Zhang couple. With a trace of doubt inside his heart, he accepted the call.Immediately, it was Mrs. Zhang\u2019s voice answering, \u201cHello, Suisui?\u201dJian Xingsui was still sleepy, he answered with his scratchy voice, \u201cYes, it\u2019s me. What\u2019s the matter?\u201dMrs. Zhang\u2019s voice sounded a little strange, \u201cYou\u2026 haven\u2019t you finished the filming? Why haven\u2019t you come back home yet?\u201dJian Xingsui said honestly, \u201cI\u2019m at a friend\u2019s house. What\u2019s wrong with you? Is there something you need from me\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMrs. Zhang on the other end seemed to be unable to bear it anymore, and almost shed tears because of the sheer sadness in her chest, \u201cXiangyang, your father\u2026 He was out last night, and I didn\u2019t know the specifics of what happened. He was distracted while driving on the way back. Yes, there was a car accident, and He\u2019s still lying in the hospital.\u201dJian Xingsui was stunned, instantly waking him up, \u201cA car accident?\u201dMrs. Zhang nodded, tears dripping from her eyes, \u201cSuisui, please come back soon, I really\u2026\u201dAlthough Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t have any special familial connection with the Zhang couple, he couldn\u2019t bear it when he heard the sadness in his mother\u2019s voice. He thought that Mrs. Zhang must be lonely and hurt, so he agreed obediently, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go back right away. You send me the address of the hospital and keep the phone on.\u201dMrs. Zhang quickly said, \u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201dJian Xingsui got up after hanging up the phone. It was only seven o\u2019clock in the morning. He only slept for three hours and already felt refreshed, while Shen Xingchen next to him slept like a pig.Jian Xingsui sighed, got up, and slipped back to the guest room. He rummaged through his clothes on his suitcase and changed into them. When he went downstairs, he met Auntie Wu. The elderly woman was still half-asleep when she greeted him, \u201cMr. Jian? I came out to check because I heard a movement on the second floor. Do you need something?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry Auntie Wu, I have something to do at home so I have to go back first.\u201d Jian Xingsui smiled at her, \u201cPlease tell Mrs. Shen and the others. Thank them too for their generosity.\u201dAuntie Wu nodded.Immediately after seeing Jian Xingsui\u2019s tired face, the househelper\u2019s thoughts cleared up. It\u2019s about seven o\u2019clock in the morning, and everyone knew that they only slept around four o\u2019clock. This child was clearly tired and needed rest, and yet he rushed back home. Just what had happened to make him rush like that? Did his so-called family didn\u2019t feel sorry for his exhaustion?Jian Xingsui finally arrived at the hospital after an hour\u2019s drive.Mrs. Zhang was still sitting in the waiting room, crying bitterly when she saw Jian Xingsui coming, \u201cSuisui, your father came out of the operating room. The doctor said his head was hit, and while he had stabilized, the dangerous period still hasn\u2019t passed. I don\u2019t know what will happen now\u2026. What should I do\u2026?\u201dJian Xingsui comforted her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, as long as the operation is successful, he will recover soon.\u201dMrs. Zhang was still wiping her tears, and said, \u201cThe operation cost tens of thousands yuan. The doctor also said that after an examination, they found that Xiangyang\u2019s poor health had taken a toll on his kidney. It\u2019s highly likely he will need to undergo a kidney operation\u2026 What should I do? That will cost so much money, where can I get them\u2026?\u201dAlthough Jian Xingsui was dissatisfied with this couple, his heart was still soft. Seeing this woman genuinely afraid of her husband\u2019s well-being touched his heart, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, money can be earned. If the doctor said he\u2019ll need kidney surgery, we should agree. After all, a human life is more precious than anything else. Do you have any life savings to use?\u201dWhen he said this, Mrs. Zhang was suspiciously silent for a moment.Jian Xingsui had a bad premonition in his heart: \u201cThe family\u2026 still have some savings, right?\u201dMrs. Zhang hurriedly said, \u201cNo, no, of course there are, but it\u2019s not too much. It\u2019s just, the operation fee will cost a lot. The doctor is also still testing your Father\u2019s lung and I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a chance that he\u2019ll have\u2026 to\u2026 you know\u2026 I\u2019m just worried our savings won\u2019t be enough.\u201dJian Xingsui was puzzled, \u201cI heard from the owner of the barber shop next door that you and Mr. Zhang have saved money over the years. They said that if your emergency savings isn\u2019t used, you\u2019ll use it as a retirement fund. But still, if the money isn\u2019t enough, I will go out and find a job to see if I can get some more.\u201dHearing Jian Xingsui\u2019s steadfast declaration made Mrs. Zhang felt a little guilty.Of course, she and Zhang Xiangyang have savings over the years. The problem was that when Anran left home, they were all worried that the child would be wronged when he came to the Jian family. So they took most of their savings for Anran before he left. Although there were still more than 200,000 yuan1about 29k USD in her hand, if Zhang Xiangyang really needed an extra operation, wouldn\u2019t their money not be enough?\u201cWhat kind of savings can we have? Isn\u2019t that all the barber shop\u2019s boss nonsense.\u201d Mrs. Zhang muttered, but she was very earnest to Jian Xingsui, \u201cSuisui, we only have you as a child now, and we can only rely on you.\u201dJian Xingsui said, \u201cI will try my best to find a job, but I really don\u2019t have any money with me now.\u201dMrs. Zhang was not happy, \u201cHow could it be? Don\u2019t you have a good relationship with the son of the Shen family? You can ask him to borrow money. Ah, and also, I remember that Actor Fu treats you well, he should be agreeable to lend you some. Those rich and noble families aren\u2019t short of money after all, lending you some wouldn\u2019t hurt them in the slightest. Can you do that for us? Or you actually don\u2019t care what will happen to your Father?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s heart suddenly became complicated and unhappy.\u201cFather\u2019s affairs are one thing, and my friends and I are another. I just treat them as casual friends, and I don\u2019t think about anything else.\u201d Jian Xingsui said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and see my Father first, and we\u2019ll talk about these things later.\u201dMrs. Zhang was a little annoyed, but she didn\u2019t say much after all.After Jian Xingsui entered the ward, he saw Zhang Xiangyang was surrounded by various life-support machines. He was still in a coma. He didn\u2019t know what happened to make this man, who had always been very cautious and careful, go out of his mind on the way back at night until he had a car accident.Mrs. Zhang has been here since last night, and she was a haggard. She said, \u201cSuisui, can you help me watch your Father for a little while? I\u2019ll lie down for a nap here\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui was actually very tired too. He had gone through an emotional turmoil since last night, and he hadn\u2019t gotten a proper rest yet. But this time, he could only nod, \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter a while, another doctor came inside.The doctor came to check Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s condition, and after checking, he said to Jian Xingsui, \u201cAre you the patient\u2019s family?\u201dJian Xingsui stood up, \u201cI am.\u201d\u201cOkay, it\u2019s like this: some of the patient\u2019s procedures have not been completed. It\u2019s better for you to complete it as soon as possible,\u201d The doctor put his hand inside his coat\u2019s pocket, \u201cRegarding the examination of his kidney disease, the kidney scan\u2019s result has come out. If it\u2019s convenient, we can talk about it in detail.\u201dJian Xingsui was a little worried when he saw the doctor: \u201cIs it not very good? The result, I mean?\u201dThe doctor took him out of the room and said, \u201cThe patient smokes all year round, and it clearly takes a toll on his overall physical health. I\u2019m afraid his smoking habit has accelerated the deterioration of his kidney\u2019s cells. You have to be prepared for the worst. Because of this car accident, his injury has aggravated his previous disease also. The treatment is\u2026 also affected.\u201dJian Xingsui said softly, \u201cPlease do your best to treat him, and we will cooperate.\u201d\u201cAlright then. Please prepare your family as well and plan for the future. We need to stabilize his lungs\u2019 condition too, so it won\u2019t get worse. Be sure to help him stop smoking completely. As for his kidney, seeing the level of necrosis on his cell, it\u2019s best to find an organ transplant soon.\u201d The doctor explained in a sympathetic tone, \u201cYou must be mentally prepared for this.\u201dJian Xingsui said, \u201cOrgan transplant? Looking for a kidney source?\u201dHe didn\u2019t expect Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s condition to be this serious.In fact, before this, Jian Xingsui felt that Zhang Xiangyang didn\u2019t care about his body. He always seemed to be preoccupied, as if he was under a lot of personal pressure. To relieve that mental pressure, he smoked. He was so addicted to cigarettes that it was frightening, but he never expected that he would come to this point.The doctor also nodded, and explained to Jian Xingsui: \u201cWell, a perfect match for a kidney transplant is not easy to find. If you are his biological child, there\u2019s a high chance you can be the donor. If you want, you can do a blood test to see the degree of the match. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s very similar to paternal testing, it won\u2019t take long until you get the result.\u201dThis was originally one (1) whole chapter with the previous one.

To everyone\u2019s surprise, Jian Xingsui\u2019s popularity on Weibo had not dissipated. The problem of voting manipulation was still ongoing, as many people felt they were scammed out of their money. Unfortunately, Anran\u2019s reputation had been dragged through the mud thanks to his fans\u2019 poor behavior. Even until now, there\u2019s still many discussions surrounding his flaws.[Anran\u2019s family is filthy rich, right? It\u2019s clear he had the capital to get through the back door, if you catch my drift.][He got the same number of bought votes as Suisui, but he came third.][Well, his older brother was one of the special guests. Do you need to doubt that there\u2019s nepotism at play here?][Did he robbed someone else\u2019s place then?][Ah, I thought he was very cute before, but I didn\u2019t expect him to be such a rotten person.]Originally, Anran had a good impression in the eyes of the public, but because of his fans\u2019 rude behavior that night, his good impression vanished within seconds. The public perception of him had hit rock bottom.In Jian family\u2019s mansion\u2013\u201cBang!\u201dThere was a loud noise in the living room, which showed how furious the man was.Jian Zhi was very angry when he saw the netizen\u2019s evaluation of his baby brother Anran. He seethed, \u201cHow dare they slander you so easily? They even said you are flaunting your capital and playing nepotism! Netizens these days are getting more irrational.\u201dAnran sat beside him with puffy red eyes. It was obvious that he had suffered a great grievance.Li-jie, Anran\u2019s manager, sat across from both of them, \u201cRanran, I didn\u2019t expect that the situation would become this bad. I suspect that someone is actually out to get you. It must be Jian Xingsui!\u00a0 He must\u2019ve instigated his fans behind the scenes to harm you on purpose.\u201dAnran glanced at Jian Zhi quietly, and said softly, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible, Li-jie. I know Suisui, he\u2026 he is quite nice, he couldn\u2019t be the one behind all of this.\u00a0 This matter is also my fault, blame me for not restraining my fans well. Don\u2019t blame Xingsui, even if he did it, it\u2019s nothing. I think maybe Suisui is still blaming me. Because if it wasn\u2019t me, it would be impossible for him to leave the Jian family\u2019s house\u2026\u201dJian Zhi felt a little distressed when he heard his little brother\u2019s words.\u201cRanran, how could this be your fault?\u201d Jian Zhi has always liked his excellent and sensible younger brother, \u201cYou are my own younger brother, it\u2019s only natural for you to come home here. I think Li-jie is right, maybe Jian Xingsui did some tricks behind our backs. Didn\u2019t he get close to that Shen Xingchen? When I was looking for him before, he said that he didn\u2019t care about money. I guess it was because he got a new thigh to hug1hugging (thick/golden) thigh = depends on a stronger person., so he now dares to be this audacious.\u201dAnran\u2019s mind was very flexible, and he grasped this line very efficiently. He continued to pretend to be weak to gain pity, \u201cSecond brother, what should I do now then?\u201dJian Zhi crossed his legs and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the public opinion is a fickle thing. We can ride this one out very soon. Jian Xingsui\u2019s company got that one million, so now they have to give us an explanation. I believe they will hide him in the future. When he is cornered with no way out, he\u2019ll grovel in front of me to beg for forgiveness.\u201dAnran and Li-jie looked at each other, and they both saw consideration in each other\u2019s eyes.The solution was not to wait for public opinion to pass. They need to be proactive in whitewashing Anran\u2019s reputation.If Anran wanted to enjoy the glory and wealth, he could rely on the Jian family. But his goal in this life was to make up for the regrets of his previous life. He was not convinced of his lost last time. He must find a way to win Fu Jinxiao over as his lover. But according to his understanding, Actor Fu always liked hardworking people. So, it\u2019s imperative for him to not go astray, be smart, and keep his innocent facade.Now everyone on the Internet is saying that he was using his capital to win his ranking, saying that he\u2019s using Jian Zhi\u2019s reputation to get privileges. If he let these sayings seep deep into the netizen\u2019s mind, how would he make Fu Jinxiao like him?? Originally, he thought that he could use Jian Zhi\u2019s power to attack Jian Xingsui, but he didn\u2019t expect that he was so unable to do so. It seemed that everything could only be done by himself.Meanwhile, in the hospital\u2013Jian Xingsui has been watching Zhang Xiangyang for the past two days. The exhaustion had made him lose weight.When Mrs. Zhang came with a meal, she saw Jian Xingsui was wiping Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s body. She walked over and said with a grateful tone, \u201cSuisui, thank you for your hard work, without you, I really don\u2019t know what to do. \u201c\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, I just do what I should do,\u201d Jian Xingsui replied. He then turned to Zhang Xiangyang and said, \u201cPlease lie down, I\u2019ll pour out the water into the basin.\u201dZhang Xiangyang nodded. He and Jian Xingsui have been in contact these past two days. At this time, he found how gentle and kind Jian Xingsui actually was. The child was very patient with him, and had taken care of him without any complaint. What\u2019s more, didn\u2019t Jian Xingsui have returned not long ago?Zhang Xiangyang looked at Jian Xingsui\u2019s tired face, and said softly: \u201cSuisui, you should go back home soon. I just need your Mother to be here. You have been up all night, you have to go back to rest properly.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s dazed state made him hesitate for a moment. He then nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201dMrs. Zhang quickly said, \u201cDon\u2019t go back to the company\u2019s dormitory. The room at home has been tidied up. Just go back and live there for a while, okay?\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t hesitate at this time, \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter Jian Xingsui left, the husband and wife pair looked at each other, as if they had something to say to each other.Zhang Xiangyang walked through the gate of hell this time, and he unexpectedly had reached some level of enlightenment. The things he had been obsessed with before seemed so insignificant in the face of death. With a calm voice, he asked, \u201cDid I have another illness?\u201dHis wife, Zhang Xia2Yes, they have the same surname even before marriage. But this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re related by blood. came over and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not serious, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, I know my body condition quite well. I can feel it by myself, you know?\u201d Zhang Xiangyang coughed a few times, \u201cThe treatment of my disease will cost a lot of money. Do we have enough?\u201dZhang Xia comforted him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Xingsui and I will figure out a solution to this matter, you just need to rest so you\u2019ll recover faster.\u201dZhang Xiangyang subconsciously frowned, \u201cThat child Xingsui, I heard that when he left home, he didn\u2019t take any money. It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know that he only got paid 20,000 yuan for the show. How much money can he have? Back then, we were afraid that Ranran would be bullied when he returned to the Jian family, so didn\u2019t you give him 500,000 yuan? Now that I\u2019m in this situation, he shouldn\u2019t be short of money, go and ask for it back.\u201dZhang Xia was taken aback, \u201cAsking him to return it?\u201dZhang Xiangyang was still frowning when he continued to explain his stance, \u201cYes, why can\u2019t we ask it back? You have seen his situation at the Jian\u2019s family. That family treats him very well. Now he has made his debut in an idol group and has his own stable job. Look at Suisui again in comparison. He was eliminated, and now he\u2019s busy taking care of me. Just where will he get money, then? We urgently need the money, I think you know this very well.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Mrs. Zhang hesitated, \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that if Ranran has any difficulties now. How will he face that, then?\u201dZhang Xiangyang felt chills down his spine when he heard his wife speak.It seems that from the very beginning, after bringing Anran back, his wife regarded this child as her own. She was devoted to this child and gave him whatever he wanted. When the inevitable truth came up and they had to return Anran to his biological family, his wife was very sad. She was unwilling to separate from Anran, and even stuffed 500,000 yuan for the child as he went back to that rich family.He could understand how deep this twenty-years of love ran. After all, he also watched Anran grow. But this time, how can she still be so obsessed? Zhang Xiangyang thought she was really crazy.As her husband, it was his duty to wake her up from her obsessive state, \u201cA-Xia, is my life more important than his difficulties?\u201dZhang Xiangyang knew saying this was akin to emotional manipulation. But he felt he had no other choice.At this time, a doctor came in from the outside and said: \u201cWard rounds.\u201dThe doctors came, and the conversation naturally ended. Zhang Xiangyang was obviously much thinner during this period. After the examination, the doctor said: \u201cFor family members, please follow me. I\u2019ll explain some things about the patient\u2019s condition.\u201dZhang Xia hurriedly followed.When they got outside, the doctor explained, \u201cAt present, we haven\u2019t found a suitable kidney donor, but we will still do our best to treat his condition. We will update you with the future treatment plan, so you can choose which one suited your condition the best. Inform your family members, you all should also make the corresponding psychological preparations. Don\u2019t let the patient have any psychological burden. Lastly, I need to ask your son\u2019s permission for a blood matching test. If the test comes out positive, then his kidney can be used as a donor. We can schedule the operations as soon as possible, then.\u201dHearing the last bit, Zhang Xia froze.Whether Jian Xingsui was willing or not was one matter. But, they didn\u2019t have any blood connection at all, so how could they use Jian Xingsui\u2019s kidney? But\u2026 how could she tell the doctor this truth?Zhang Xia asked again, \u201cDoctor, is it okay if\u2026 we still want to find other suitable donor\u2026\u201dThe doctor gave Zhang Xia a meaningful look.Zhang Xia felt a little guilty.The doctor had no choice but to say: \u201cOf course that\u2019s fine, but you have to know that the patient\u2019s treatment opportunities are limited. We also can\u2019t be sure that a matching donor could easily be found. Your family should weigh all the decisions carefully.\u201dZhang Xia nodded, \u201cI understand, doctor.\u201dOf course she knew that it would be difficult to find. But at worst, she would go to Ranran, and that lovely boy would definitely not ignore her and the Father who had raised him for so many years. As long as Ranran was willing to help, everything would be fine.Uh\u2026 hurray for Zhang Xiangyang to finally see the truth? Took you a near-death experience to reach it, but congrats I guess.1hugging (thick/golden) thigh = depends on a stronger person.2Yes, they have the same surname even before marriage. But this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re related by blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please proceed with caution.If you want to know what happened, click below:In his past life, JXS was harassed by sick antis who told him to kill himself because he was perceived to be \u201cAnran\u2019s bully\u201d.After reaching the Zhang family\u2019s house, Jian Xingsui fell asleep as soon as he reached his newly-instated bedroom.He only came back to sleep during the day, and when he woke up, it was already dark. It seemed that he slept through the evening also.He didn\u2019t wake up naturally, though.In fact, he didn\u2019t expect to be woken up from a phone call from his agent Wang-ge. After that finale, Jian Xingsui knew that there would be a day of reckoning.And that day finally dawned. He could only bravely answer this phone call.Jian Xingsui greeted in a calm tone, \u201cWang-ge.\u201dHis agent cut to the chase, \u201cXingsui, did you see the hot search this morning?\u201dJian Xingsui was taken aback by the unexpected question, \u201cWhat hot search?\u201dWang-ge sighed: \u201cIf you don\u2019t know yet, go and have a look.\u201dJian Xingsui immediately switched his phone to open the Weibo app. There, he saw\u2013#JianXingsuiAnran#When he saw this topic, Jian Xingsui had a hunch it was something bad. After all, everytime he got involved with Anran, he would encounter an unlucky situation.And sure enough, after clicking it, he found that the hot search content was actually posted by a classmate he and Anran used to share. This classmate knew that Jian Xingsui used to be a child of the Jian\u2019s family, and he also knew Anran, so he was on the cusp of this storm.He \u201cexposed\u201d this incident, and also attached a lot of pictures to serve as the proof of his credibility. It showed that Jian Xingsui and Anran were switched at birth, and before that, Jian Xingsui always bullied Anran.The melon-eating netizens on Weibo were also quite shocked:[Fuck! Even novels don\u2019t dare to write this kind of plot anymore!][This news feels so unreal!][I read this and instantly became no longer sleepy.]A lot of classmates came out to support this statement. They told the netizens Jian Xingsui\u2019s \u201csecret side\u201d with an unified voice:[Jian Xingsui has a weird personality in school.][Of course he bullied Anran and made things difficult for him in the school cafeteria.][Anran is really pitiful.]Just yesterday, the whole Internet was scolding Anran for using capital and familial connection. The netizens didn\u2019t expect such a big melon would be exposed today. Apart from being shocked, a large part of the netizens spontaneously stood up for justice. After they learned that this poor little Anran had been bullied by Jian Xingsui. Of course they started attacking the culprit.[To be honest, I have long felt that he is not a good person.][His personal strength isn\u2019t that good anyways,\u00a0 why should he make his debut?][Fans, come see the true face of your idol! School violence record, isn\u2019t he so nice?]Jian Xingsui watched all of this silently. A complicated feeling rose from inside his heart.He remembered that this incident also happened in his previous life. But at that time, it was not during the end of \u201cStarlight\u201d. Instead, it was \u201cdug up\u201d far long from this time, around the time when Anran had become famous. He got many insults thrown at him from all over the Internet. Even some portion of Anran\u2019s rabid fans attacked him in real life. It dealt a double blow to him, both physically and mentally.It was also because of this incident that he was so devastated, he lost his mind in the end and passed away in a car accident.The same thing happened again. This time, he didn\u2019t feel anymore fear or helplessness he experienced in his previous life. He had become much calmer, so his heart might be swayed, but it stayed relatively normal.What strange was\u2026 why is this incident brought forward so early this time?Wang-ge\u2018s voice was still on the other end of the phone, \u201cSuisui, what\u2019s going on? Is it true?\u201dJian Xingsui calmly explained, although he had no dream that his agent would 100% understand his side of the story, \u201cI was ignorant before, and I didn\u2019t want to leave the Jian family. I did confront Anran personally.\u201dBut his original intention was not to bully Anran, he just wanted to find him to clear things up. But for some reason, every time they met, Anran would look frightened and wronged, making himself at a loss what to do. Before his rebirth, he always thought that Anran was timid and that he had gone too far.It was only later that he realized that\u2026 no matter whether I did anything to Anran or not, Anran always used this to persuade others to seek justice in his behalf. If he didn\u2019t pretend to look that way before, how could anyone pity and choose to stand by his side?Wang-ge sighed, \u201cThen this matter will be difficult for you to clarify. Besides, you offended the company, and that one million money hasn\u2019t been resolved yet. Let me tell you the truth, especially because of our past friendship, I just got told by the higher-up to snow you in1hide JXS from the public. He won\u2019t get any new jobs from the company, and if he seeks it himself, they probably would obstruct him.. You can\u2019t blame anyone but yourself, you know?\u201dJian Xingsui lowered his eyes. His thoughts darkened as he hardened his heart, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. If you want to snow me in, just do it.\u201dHis agent choked on pure air. He didn\u2019t expect Jian Xingsui to say such bold words with that level of conviction.But what he didn\u2019t know was that Jian Xingsui was basically numb to these things, so of course he didn\u2019t care about them. Even if the company didn\u2019t hide him, he originally wanted to terminate the contract anyways.Wang-ge stammered, clearly still flustered, \u201cYou\u2026 then you can take care of yourself.\u201dJian Xingsui responded with a noncommittal hum and hung up the phone.He tried to sit up and looked at the time on his phone. He didn\u2019t have any food at home, but he didn\u2019t want to waste money on ordering takeaways. Finally, he found some dried noodles in the kitchen and ate it with plain water as the soup. The meal was basically tasteless. It was unappetizing.At that very moment, he remembered something in a daze \u2013 not long ago, he had a bowl of very fragrant noodles, which was like heaven and earth compared to today\u2019s noodles.However, he could only recall them as a fond memory now.Jian Xingsui quickly finished the noodles and washed the dishes. He sat on the sofa to rest for a while, opened WeChat and saw that he had received a lot of messages. Most of them were asking him about the Weibo hot search\u2019s matter. Many people came to ask if it was true. He knew that most of them only wanted to be in the excitement, and that spelled trouble for him.But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. He was far too exhausted to reply to any of them.He clicked one of his friend\u2019s Moments. To his surprise, he didn\u2019t expect that he actually clicked on Fu Jinxiao\u2019s Moments. It was a post of Fu Jinxiao on a beach, catching a big fish. The place should be a private vacation island. The caption of the post was:[They took the bait.]There were many comments on this post:[You\u2019re on a vacation? Sick! Where is it?][Sure enough, after filming such a long show, you ran away to a tropical beach somewhere.][Did ge catch me instead?]The last comment caught Jian Xingsui off-guard. He swiped on that comment, and saw that Fu Jinxiao replied with a rather solemn tone:[You are too heavy for me to catch.]Jian Xingsui couldn\u2019t hold back his frown when he saw that.He muled about it for a while, but in the end, he didn\u2019t dare to comment. He felt that the relationship between himself and Actor Fu was not that good.He thought that if he commented and didn\u2019t get a reply, he would be very disappointed and sad. So he made a compromise and gave this WeChat post a thumbs up.What he didn\u2019t expect was that not long after he clicked the \u201clike\u201d button, he received a WeChat message.Jian Xingsui immediately backed away, but he didn\u2019t expect that Fu Jinxiao actually sent himself a message: [Wake up so early?]It was only five o\u2019clock in the morning, so the question made sense.Jian Xingsui replied: [Well, I slept all night, but you are still awake.]Fu Jinxiao replied concisely: [We are currently on different time-zones. ]It was only then that Jian Xingsui realized that the man should not be in the country, but was on vacation abroad. He knew this, because no matter where the actor went to play during the holidays, there would be a crowd of people around him. So Fu Jinxiao would go abroad for vacations, usually on a private island to ensure his privacy.Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t know what to talk about, but he didn\u2019t want to waste this chance to speak with his idol. He thought about his reply for a while, before settling for a safe one: [I saw the fish you caught, it\u2019s a big fish. Your fishing skill is really good.]After a short moment, he got a reply: [There\u2019s a staff member who drove the fish over to my side. Even an idiot can catch it.]\u201c\u2026\u201dReally truthful.Jian Xingsui still bit the bullet and praised him: [Still, it\u2019s quite impressive.]Fu Jinxiao has seen through this little rainbow fart2excessive praise.. In fact, he didn\u2019t know why he sent a message to Jian Xingsui by accident, but doing so really made him feel happy. His mood improved a lot, so he asked again: [How are you doing recently?]Jian Xingsui paused for a moment. He guessed that Fu Jinxiao probably hadn\u2019t seen that hot search yet.If he saw that, how would he think about Jian Xingsui? If he saw that\u2026 he probably would never talk so casually with him ever again. Thinking of this, Jian Xingsui\u2019s heart sank slowly, the bitterness in his tongue doubled, leaving him a little out of breath.Jian Xingsui held his phone with a trembling hand, and finally replied: [Very good.]But Fu Jinxiao sent a message back: [It seems that your mentality is not bad.]Seeing this type of reply only meant one thing: [You know?]Fu Jinxiao replied. He actually was just teasing the youth: [Weibo just gave me a notification.][Not bad, your current popularity is almost equal to an A-tier celebrity now.]Jian Xingsui originally felt bitter, but Fu Jinxiao\u2019s reply made him feel as if the big stone weighing him down was finally taken off.Fu Jinxiao knew of the controversy, and yet, was still willing to talk to him cordially.[Then you\u2026]Jian Xingsui typed two words and hesitated, but he still had the courage to ask: [Will you also think that I\u2026 am a vicious person after reading those accusations?]The waiting time was a bit long. His heart almost raised to his throat.After half a ring, his phone vibrated, signalling that Fu Jinxiao sent him a reply: [If you want to know someone in the future, you can\u2019t only rely on the public\u2019s opinion on them. You must form your own thoughts and opinions. In fact, if you just based it on the public opinion, you wouldn\u2019t actually know 90% of the people in this industry.][While it\u2019s natural to form an opinion based on what you heard, the true excellent people wouldn\u2019t do that. They will see you for what you actually are.] Fu Jinxiao\u2019s words were concise yet heartwarming: [I didn\u2019t see your so-called \u201cviciousness\u201d anyway. Do you think I\u2019m a sheep that could easily be persuaded by the netizen\u2019s one-sided belief?]Fu Jinxiao\u2019s words breathed a new life to Jian Xingsui. Slowly, he heaved a sigh of relief he didn\u2019t know he held.In his previous life, no one believed him. Everyone only wanted to believe what information they were spoon-fed. Everyone was unified in scolding him \u2013 they said he was vicious, that a person like him doesn\u2019t deserve to live, and he should off himself for the good of this world. The overwhelming malice suffocated him.But in this life, someone said that he believed that Jian Xingsui was not such a vicious person. And this person was Fu Jinxiao, his favorite idol for many years.This was enough.On the other side\u2013Anran called Mrs. Zhang early in the morning.Mrs. Zhang answered the phone cheerfully: \u201cRanran!\u201dThis time, Anran called to put some pressure on Mrs. Zhang to leave the city with Jian Xingsui and go back to that small town. This wave of \u201cexpose\u201d was something he had planned in advance. He also asked his agent to arrange exaggerated words and guide people on the Internet to carry out the cyber-harassment. This was to increase the pressure on Jian Xingsui so he would leave immediately. Furthermore, this was also a way to whitewash himself from his previous scandal.Unexpectedly, Mrs. Zhang said: \u201cRanran, do you know about your Father\u2019s condition?\u201dAnran was taken aback: \u201cDad? What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201dMrs. Zhang contained her sadness, \u201cRanran, your father\u2019s current health situation is really serious. If he can\u2019t find a suitable kidney donor, he may die. You must help me. I can only rely on you.\u201dAnran was a little surprised: \u201cHas Dad been diagnosed?\u201dMrs. Zhang nodded: \u201cYes, he has!\u201dAnran\u2019s eyes changed. He didn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. While he brought forward his revenge against Jian Xingsui earlier this time, he didn\u2019t expect that the matter of Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s deteriorating health also came forward. What\u2019s the causality that caused this? Could it be\u2026 because of his phone call that night?In his previous life, Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s illness did not occur so early. It only occured at least five years later. He remembered that Zhang Xiangyang passed away without finding a suitable kidney donor. After his death, Mrs. Zhang\u2019s spirit also had some problems. Because of her excessive grief, she only had a few years before she followed her husband to the other world.Then in this life\u2026Anran understood that if he asks the Jian family to help him with all their strength, he might be able to find a suitable donor. After all, if the timeline could change, then everything could also change.But if Zhang Xiangyang is ill, Jian Xingsui would naturally have no time to go to that countryside town. Besides, he might be pushed into doing a paternity test.But\u2026 if Zhang Xiangyang passed away normally according to the timeline of his previous life, then Mrs. Zhang\u2019s fate also would not change\u2026Then wouldn\u2019t that mean nobody would know that Jian Xingsui wasn\u2019t the Zhang\u2019s biological son?Mrs. Zhang on the other end of the phone was still crying softly, \u201cRanran, you must find a way. You have been under our care for so many years. You know that I cannot live without him. We only have one child like you. If you don\u2019t help, your Father will have no way out!\u201dAnran heard it in his ears, but his heart was indifferent.At first he thought that he and Jian Xingsui were only accidentally switched at birth. But after knowing that Jian Xingsui also wasn\u2019t the Zhang\u2019s son, he had a vague guess of what actually happened. He had a guess that the Zhang couple had committed a heinous crime.Although the Zhang couple treated him well since childhood, they still wronged him. If it wasn\u2019t for them, how could he, a child of a rich family, become the child of a mere rice cake shop owner?!He could have made a name for himself in a wealthy family like Jian Xingsui, but they ruined everything! At least Jian Xingsui was rich in the first half of his life, and he had nothing in comparison. In the second half of his life, Jian Xingsui finally got the life he deserved, but he still had such a shitty ending.Why would all the good things he deserved get replaced by Jian Xingsui?Preposterous.He no longer wanted that shitty ending. Nobody knew how furious he was during that time.Anran took a deep breath to calm himself, \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry, my Dad\u2019s affairs are on my shoulders. I will definitely find a way to help him.\u201dIf the world won\u2019t feel sorry for him, then fine.He\u2019ll get his own revenge by himself.I vomited a little every time I had to type AR\u2019s thoughts. Disgusting level of self-entitlement and green tea.1hide JXS from the public. He won\u2019t get any new jobs from the company, and if he seeks it himself, they probably would obstruct him.2excessive praise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They believed in the news, and have begun to turn against Jian Xingsui. Jian Xingsui\u2019s Weibo was also full of people from all walks of life. There were those who support him, and of course there are those who insult and oppose him.[At least Ranran is back to his home now.][Doesn\u2019t Jian Xingsui feel like a counterfeit?][He grows up in a wealthy family like the Jian\u2019s, but his singing and dancing are not as good as Ranran\u2019s.][Fortunately, he was eliminated. Let\u2019s kick him out of the entertainment circle.]Among the objections, some fans were still struggling to control the public opinion:[It\u2019s interesting that you all suddenly believed in these unverified rumors.][I believe in Suisui\u2019s character, he would not do such a thing.][The truth of the matter hasn\u2019t fully come out yet, I believe him.]Weibo once again had turned into a warzone. But in reality, Jian Xingsui was too busy to care about the turmoil on the Internet.In fact, Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s condition has only worsened. Zhang Xia shed tears every day, but Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s kidney donor still wasn\u2019t found.Jian Xingsui came in from the outside carrying a lunch box, and saw Zhang Xia wiping her swollen eyes from dried tears.Zhang Xia looked up and saw him, crying a bit: \u201cSuisui\u2026\u201dThe couple\u2019s relationship was very deep, and Jian Xingsui could also see it. Ever since Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s incident happened, Zhang Xia has always been in this sad state. She couldn\u2019t sleep well, couldn\u2019t eat well, and her mind was always full of worries.Jian Xingsui showed her the lunch box, \u201cI cooked something, you and Father can eat some.\u201dZhang Xia was a little surprised, \u201cSuisui, you can cook?\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t have the talent in this area. In fact, his skill was dubious, and more often than not, he produced dark cuisine1the food doesn\u2019t taste very good or it looks gross but tastes good. A popular trope in fiction. instead. However, in his last life, he used to study and practice some recipes to make the Jian patriarch happy. While his effort wasn\u2019t a success, at least his knowledge was useful now.\u201cIt\u2019s not cooked very well, I admit.\u201d Jian Xingsui opened the lunch box, \u201cThis is noodle soup. You two cannot eat greasy food, so I only give the soup some light seasonings.\u201dZhang Xia saw that he took out another lunch box. \u201cI also bought a fried chicken meal combo from a shop near home. You haven\u2019t eaten well these days, so eat some meat and vegetables to supplement your nutrition.\u201dJian Xingsui staunchly avoided talking about his own food. But Zhang Xia caught this, and asked with a guess inside her heart, \u201cWhat about you? What do you eat?\u201dJian Xingsui was stunned for a moment, then smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve eaten at home.\u201dThe older woman looked at Jian Xingsui\u2019s state in surprise. She knew that back at home there was not much groceries left, and Jian Xingsui also shouldn\u2019t be able to buy them. But he still meticulously cooks meals for Zhang Xiangyang and herself. In contrast, it seemed like Jian Xingsui only ate to pad his stomach \u2013 he probably ate something with low nutrition and drinking a lot of plain water to stop his hunger.Zhang Xia: \u201cDid you\u2026 eat noodles?\u201dJian Xingsui put the rice into her hand and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m still young. I can eat anything.\u201dFeeling the warm lunch box in her hand made her heart also feel hot. She returned the rice to Jian Xingsui, and hurriedly said, \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite. You\u2019re still young, you need more nutrition to sustain your body. Eat this chicken meal you bought!\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t want it, and refused to receive the box.\u201cI\u2019ve already eaten at home, and I bought this for you.\u201d Jian Xingsui looked at her quietly and smiled, \u201cNow that the family\u2019s finances are relatively tight, I can\u2019t buy you better meals. Just don\u2019t dislike it.\u201dZhang Xia quickly shook her head: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t dislike it.\u201dShe opened the rice and took a bite of the chicken leg. It should be just a cheap rice bowl meal, but the taste was shockingly delicious.When this accident happened, the person she thought about, wanted to rely on, and trusted was always Anran. In her eyes, she never regarded Jian Xingsui, an outsider, as her own child. but she didn\u2019t expect that Jian Xingsui really did everything he could do to care for them. He was very kind and filial.Even Anran only returned 100,000 yuan out of the 500,000 he was given. He said that because of some accidents, his personal funds were tight, so he couldn\u2019t give much for the time being.Although Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t have a lot of savings, he gave everything to them. He was somehow still able to take care of her and Zhang Xiangyang. When they were in trouble, it was Jian Xingsui who was by their side.\u201cYou can go back after dinner.\u201d Jian Xingsui said, \u201cI\u2019ll take over the watch duty.\u201dZhang Xia nodded. She looked at the child with a mix of jumbled emotion \u2013 guilt, fondness, gratefulness, sadness \u2013 and said softly, \u201cSuisui\u2026 Thank you.\u201dJian Xingsui replied in an equally soft voice, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, I just do what I should do.\u201dThe older woman\u2019s heart felt hurt. But she quelled it down.Not long after, she went home in a complicated mood. When she arrived, she saw many neighbors near the alley of her house. The neighbors all knew about Jian Xingsui in her family, so they all gathered around, \u201cA-Xia, your family\u2019s Anran is now a big star. He\u2019s also very famous on the Internet. But we have seen something recently, saying that Jian Xingsui used to bully Ranran in school, is it true?\u201dZhang Xia was stunned, \u201cWhere did you hear about this?\u201dThe neighbors clapped their hands and showed Zhang Xia their mobile phones, \u201cYou don\u2019t even use the Internet. It\u2019s very lively over there.\u201dBecause Zhang Xia was overwhelmed with her husband\u2019s affairs, she didn\u2019t have the time to go online to read gossip. But after hearing what the neighbors said, she couldn\u2019t sit still, so she took it from her neighbor\u2019s hand and read it.The hot search on Weibo is still hanging: #JianXingsuiAnran#She scrolled over the posts with that tag. All of them were reprimanding Jian Xingsui for being arrogant and unreasonable. Some even describe how vicious Jian Xingsui actually was.The neighbors chattered nearby:\u201cThat Suisui, I didn\u2019t expect him to be such a vicious child.\u201d\u201cRanran really suffered.\u201d\u201cHe must not be filial to you, right?\u201d\u201cThis kind of child, you should cut off contact as soon as possible from him!\u201dZhang Xia returned the phone, and when she saw the neighbors saying this, she felt an unknown feeling bubbled up to her throat, \u201cDon\u2019t read the nonsense of people on the Internet. How can Suisui be so bad? Let me tell you, this child is very good. He\u2019s very filial and obedient.\u201dThe neighbors listened to Zhang Xia\u2019s unexpected defence of Jian Xingsui. They were stunned, especially when they remembered that Zhang Xia was the saddest party when Anran had to leave. And wasn\u2019t she also the person who resisted Jian Xingsui the most? She made such a fuss back then, to the point that everyone in the neighborhood knew.But now, they heard Zhang Xia\u2019s blatant praise towards Jian Xingsui. What had happened to make her get a 180\u00b0\u00a0turn like this\u2026?The neighbor curled their lips and said, \u201cA-Xia, let me tell you, we didn\u2019t talk about this matter like that. In fact, we read it from your family\u2019s Anran\u2019s Weibo post. You see, yesterday, he posted something that implied he agreed with the original statement denouncing Jian Xingsui. If you say that about Jian Xingsui, could it be that child Anran lied and took the lead in framing Jian Xingsui?\u201dZhang Xia was stunned when she heard this, and subconsciously retorted: \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, why would Ranran do such a thing?\u201dThe neighbor could see that Zhang Xia was angry, so they chose to show her the hard evidence instead, \u201cIf you still don\u2019t believe me, let me show you!\u201dZhang Xia took the phone and saw Anran\u2019s Weibo post on the screen, which was posted yesterday: [Thank you for your attention to my past. But the matter has passed, we all have to move on and look forward to the future.]This Weibo might looked like he didn\u2019t mind anymore because the matter was over. But in fact, wasn\u2019t he confirming the rumors that Jian Xingsui bullied others?It was precisely because of this Weibo that the popularity of this matter has increased a lot, which directly led to today\u2019s situation. The scandal hadn\u2019t blown over, and the netizens no longer believed the original scandal was because of someone trying to slander Jian Xingsui. If Anran, the person involved, said this, wasn\u2019t this an ironclad proof of Jian Xingsui\u2019s bullying scandal?A neighbor said from the side: \u201cI\u2019m not wrong, am I?\u201dZhang Xia looked at this Weibo and couldn\u2019t speak for a long time.\u201cRegardless, with his reputation, Jian Xingsui wouldn\u2019t be able to continue a career in the entertainment industry anymore. You have to find him something else to do!\u201dA different neighbor was a little excited, she wanted to add fuel to this fire, \u201cAlso, Today I saw that Jian Xingsui was shopping in that convenience store. I told him to be careful. But I was shocked when that kid said he\u2019s not afraid of being beaten because of, and I quote, \u2018some rando on the Internet\u2019. Sheesh, this kid\u2026\u201dWhen Zhang Xia heard it with her own ears, she somehow felt a little stuffy.The neighbor originally wanted to say more, but after seeing her face and remembering her husband\u2019s condition, she had no choice but to shut up.When Zhang Xia returned home, she felt uncomfortable no matter what she thought, so she picked up her mobile phone and dialed Anran\u2019s number.\u201cBeep\u2026\u201dAfter waiting for a while, the phone was picked up.Anran\u2019s voice came from the other side, \u201cMom, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cRanran, what\u2019s going on on the Internet?\u201d Zhang Xia directly asked him the point, \u201cNo matter what happened with Jian Xingsui in the past, you can\u2019t just let the media say that. Ahhh, how will he work and make money in the future? Can your Father and I have a good time like this? He\u2019s still our child! How can he support himself and us without a good income?\u201dAnran knew that Zhang Xia was only selfishly thinking about herself, so he rebutted, \u201cMom, I didn\u2019t release this news. What\u2019s the use of you questioning me? I can\u2019t control other people.\u201dZhang Xia didn\u2019t know what to say.She just thought it was wrong for Anran to do this, but she didn\u2019t know how to refute Anran\u2019s words, so she could only ask, \u201cRanran, then what happened to the matter I asked you to do? It\u2019s been almost half a month, your Father\u2019s condition is getting worse and worse. You know he has kidney failure, he won\u2019t last long without a donor. You must try to help him find it.\u201dCompared to Jian Xingsui, Zhang Xia naturally cared more about her husband. But she never expected that Anran never looked for him despite all the years they spent caring for him.The corners of Anran\u2019s mouth curled into a sneer, but his voice didn\u2019t reflect that. He looked like he was still trying to comfort her, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about this too, Mom. I\u2019ll definitely do my best, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dZhang Xia could only nod: \u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good\u2026\u201dAnran just hung up the phone.But Anran didn\u2019t expect that because of the neighbor\u2019s words, Zhang Xia began to feel uncomfortable after he hung up so abruptly. Originally, she had no doubts about Anran, but after seeing Jian Xingsui\u2019s devotion with her own eyes\u2026 she was fully convinced that she had misunderstood him.The next day.Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s condition obviously deteriorated.Zhang Xia\u2019s heart became more and more anxious. She often had a sad face outside the ward. After a long time, she also met with family members in other wards in the corridor and had conversations with them. She wanted to gather as much information about kidney transplant and donor matching.\u201cOne of my relatives also had kidney failure, but thankfully, we have found a suitable match.\u201d A middle-aged woman from the next ward was sitting next to her, \u201cLuckily, I dragged someone to find it.\u201dZhang Xia was stunned, and quickly asked, \u201cWhere did you find it?\u201dThe woman said in a conspiratorial whisper, \u201cWith enough money, anything is possible. My nephew can be regarded as a small boss. He spent a lot of energy and connections to find it. He\u2026 \u2018donated\u2019 to many people on the know-how about it, and finally found a suitable match. Sigh\u2026 honestly, our family doesn\u2019t know how to repay him. He must\u2019ve spent a lot of capital.\u201dZhang Xia murmured, \u201cSo you can find it by spending money and energy?\u201d\u201cIt still depends on your luck, but the odds become much better if you spend them, yes. I remember that you haven\u2019t tried to match many people, you can\u2019t just wait passively like this!\u201d But the middle-aged woman sighed when she remembered something crucial, \u201cHowever, your family\u2019s financial conditions are relatively difficult\u2026 so I know\u2026 it\u2019s an uphill battle for you.\u201dHearing it, Zhang Xia\u2019s heart sank.At first she thought that Anran just hadn\u2019t found an appropriate match, because it was difficult. But\u2026 how could the Jian family compare with ordinary small bosses? Despite having such a good connection, Anran still couldn\u2019t find it.Just as she was thinking, her cell phone vibrated, it was a message from Anran: [Mom, Dad has been in the hospital for so long. I want to take some time to come and see him today, can you send me the address?]Mrs. Zhang was now angry, and replied with vitriol: [You\u2019re so busy, do you still have time to see him? I think it\u2019s better for you to forget it.]After sending the message, Mrs. Zhang covered her lips, and the tears in her eyes fell down uncontrollably.\u201cSqueak\u201dAt this moment, the door of the ward behind her was opened, and someone came out from inside. Jian Xingsui saw Zhang Xia who was squatting and crying by the door, and was a little worried: \u201cAre you all right?\u201dZhang Xia saw Jian Xingsui looking so worried. It made her even more sad, her tears fell even more violently.Jian Xingsui thought it was because of kidney donor trouble. He sighed, and then said: \u201cJust now, I saw that his condition seems to be more serious. The first two tests of potential donors aren\u2019t good. And if this drags on, the doctor said it would become life-threatening to him. So, how about I\u2019ll go for a blood test to see the match?\u201dMrs. Zhang was stunned, and looked at Jian Xingsui in disbelief.Jian Xingsui was a little embarrassed by her gaze, he lowered his head, and said softly: \u201cWe could get a blood test to see that, and also get a paternity test along the way. If I am indeed of your flesh and blood, then no matter what, as long as it is suitable, I am willing to save him. You don\u2019t have to worry, everything will be fine.\u201dThese words seemed to hit Zhang\u2019s heart with a heavy hammer, making her both desperate and emotional.Their family didn\u2019t spare any kindness towards Jian Xingsui, but even so, Jian Xingsui was willing to be filial to them. He was even willing to be her husband\u2019s kidney donor should they match.The child she was willing to take out her lungs, in comparison, seemed to delay things and did it in such a perfunctory manner.Mrs. Zhang endured her grief, \u201cIt\u2019s okay Suisui, I\u2019ve already asked Ranran for help, he should be able to find a way. We won\u2019t use your kidney unless it is absolutely necessary. Of course we hope that you are in good health\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui looked at Mrs. Zhang\u2019s overwhelming sadness, he had no choice but to agree, \u201cThen wait a little longer. I\u2019m afraid Father won\u2019t be able to hold on. You\u2026 also don\u2019t work too hard, or your body will get sick also.\u201dMrs. Zhang knew what he said was right.She also was afraid she would spill and reveal her sins here if she continued to talk. So, she decided to go home.If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1the food doesn\u2019t taste very good or it looks gross but tastes good.

However, there were still many of Anran\u2019s fans and righteous people who were still paying attention to this matter. Xiao Zhang, a man who lived near the Zhang couple\u2019s rice cake shop, was one of them. He had liked Anran since he was a child, and was also one of Anran\u2019s admirers\u2014knowing that Jian Xingsui was living nearby, today he decided to come over and confront him on the spot. He wanted to expose Jian Xingsui\u2019s true face behind that hypocritical veneer.In this regard, Xiao Zhang also opened a live broadcast.Xiao Zhang has already chosen the title of his live broadcast: [Explore Jian Xingsui\u2019s true face. Giving netizens the truth of the bullying scandal.]Xiao Zhang smiled at the camera after starting the live broadcast, \u201cHi everyone, I am Xiao Zhang, and the shop behind me is Jian Xingsui\u2019s home. But, our current location is the small building opposite of that, which is relatively hidden. I chose this location because I\u2019m afraid Jian Xingsui will run away when I expose his true nature. So, we will wait here for a while. When he appears, we will approach him.\u201dMany people originally this live broadcast was a joke, so they were surprised to see it was real:[Unreal?? Anchor, you didn\u2019t lie to us about this??][What do you want to do?][Is it really possible to confront him face-to-face?][Anchor, don\u2019t stoop as low as Jian Xingsui. How do you even get his address?]Xiao Zhang chuckled softly. He confidently explained his purpose, \u201cI didn\u2019t need to illegally get his home address, because my family lives here. Today, I\u2019m here to seek justice for Ranran!\u201dThe majority of his viewers echoed his last sentiment.Xiao Zhang was waiting patiently. For about an hour, there were more and more people in the live broadcast room, but today\u2019s protagonists did not appear for a long time. Everyone gradually became impatient. Just when everyone began to question whether Xiao Zhang was faking it, he saw someone appear \u2013 it was Zhang Xia who was carrying a bag.Xiao Zhang immediately said, \u201cThat\u2019s Jian Xingsui\u2019s mother! Why is she here? Where is Jian Xingsui?\u201dXiao Zhang was a little disappointed. But he didn\u2019t expect that another person would also appear. A flashy car stopped near the street, and from there, a familiar young man came out. That person quickly catched up with Zhang Xia as he shouted, \u201cMom!\u201dAs the camera zoomed in, not only Zhang Xia, but other netizens also noticed that the other person was actually Anran!Now the netizens were boiling, and even Xiao Zhang himself felt very excited. This was totally worth it!On the other side, in the hospital.Jian Xingsui was tired, but he still accompanied Zhang Xiangyang. The older man, who had just undergone dialysis, was a little weak. Jian Xingsui said in a tired voice, \u201cDo you want something?\u201dZhang Xiangyang looked at the face of the young man next to him, with tears in his eyes: \u201cSuisui, I can\u2019t sleep, and I can\u2019t eat\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui looked at the older man\u2019s thin body and said worriedly, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 to be expected. Your current physical condition\u2026 but still, you need to eat and sleep to recover.\u201d\u201cRecently, I often have dreams. Many, myriad of things.\u201d Zhang Xiangyang mumbled. In fact, he understood the truth \u2013 Anran was the child he cared for two decades, it\u2019s impossible to not have fond feelings for him. Despite that, during his terrible illness, not even once had Anran visited him. So what did he not understand? He might be weak, but he wasn\u2019t a total fool.On the opposite side, Jian Xingsui was with him all the time, through his worst sickness. He continued his mumbles, \u201cI dreamed about some things when I was young. It was one of my fondest memories I had. At that time, I just met A-Xia. She is a nurse in a hospital, and I am a catering worker. I deliver food to her every day, she loves it. I remember sneaking her extra portions of food out of my own wallet, and I think she knew it was my doing. Not long after, our feelings grew, and we ended up getting married.\u201dJian Xingsui smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s quite romantic.\u201dZhang Xiangyang\u2019s eyes flickered, his lips twisted into a bitter smile, \u201cBut later, she and I had done too many wrong things, and I don\u2019t know if we can pay back in this life\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui saw that Zhang Xiangyang was covering his body after he finished speaking. He seemed to be in horrible pain. He coughed his lungs out, so Jian Xingsui patted his back in hope to alleviate some of the pain. With a gentle tone, he reassured, \u201cYou\u2019re still not that old, still have a couple decades left. Your illness will be cured, if you can\u2019t find a suitable donor, I\u2019m willing to do a blood test matching. So, don\u2019t worry.\u201dAfter Zhang Xiangyang heard this sentence, his hands trembled slightly, and he laughed softly. It was only at the critical moment of life and death that he could see people\u2019s hearts clearly. The more he came into contact with Jian Xingsui, the more he discovered the child\u2019s pure, beautiful soul.This matter was partially his fault. Maybe God had given him a moment of clarity before his death so he could atone his past sins. He steeled his will, and decided that Jian Xingsui deserved to know the truth and pursue his own happiness \u2013 free of the burden he and his wife had inflicted on this pure-hearted child.Jian Xingsui looked at him suspiciously.Zhang Xiangyang shook his head slightly, and said: \u201cSuisui, it\u2019s almost\u2026 it\u2019s been almost a month since I saw the outside world. Can you\u2013 huff, huff, can you\u2026 take me for a walk today? I want to go home and have a look, maybe see other nostalgic places along the way.\u201dJian Xingsui hesitated for a moment, then nodded: \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter consulting the doctor for approval, they left the hospital temporarily.When he came out, Jian Xingsui answered a call from Shen Xingchen. The young master\u2019s voice showed a clear agitation, but Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t know why, \u201cYou are a dead person to me. You didn\u2019t answer my WeChat message! Do you want me to die in a hurry??\u201dHearing Shen Xingchen\u2019s vibrant cursing lifted Jian Xingsui\u2019s mood. \u201cDidn\u2019t I talk to you that day? I\u2019m fine.\u201dOn the day the Weibo scandal blew up, he sent Shen Xingchen a message to reassure him.It\u2019s just that Shen Xingchen\u2019s family was on vacation abroad at that time, so Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t come over to support him in-person. Shen Xingchen had arrived in China, so he wanted to meet his self-proclaimed didi soon, \u201cWhere are you now? I\u2019ll go there.\u201dHowever, Jian Xingsui stopped him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t hang out with you today. I have to go home and take care of Uncle Zhang.\u201dShen Xingchen spat and hung up the phone.At home, Xu Enzhen was still cooking chicken soup with Auntie Wu. Seeing that her youngest son had finished his call, she asked, \u201cHow is it, does Suisui agree?\u201dThe more Shen Xingchen thought about the abrupt rejection, the angrier he became. \u201cHe\u2019s too busy for us to take care of him. Bah! Just let him die from exhaustion. See if I care!\u201dXu Enzhen knew that her son actually cared about his friend.She put the lid on the pot and said, \u201cSince he\u2019s busy, let\u2019s go over there later. That kid must be exhausted during this time. When he\u2019s available, send this chicken soup over to feed him.\u201dShen Xingchen\u2019s temper flare ended, so he nodded obediently. \u201cOkay, I just don\u2019t know his address, so I have to check it out.\u201dMeanwhile, in front of the Zhang\u2019s rice cake shop.Anran followed Mrs. Zhang into the small courtyard of her house, and smiled at her, \u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong with you, your eyes are so red\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because of your Father\u2019s condition?\u201d Mrs. Zhang was now angry, \u201cRanran, I have already asked other people. They all said that as long as they are willing to spend money, as long as they have contacts, as long as the connections are in place, they can find a kidney source no matter what! Ranran, tell me the truth, do you even try to search?! Did you lie about this?!\u201dAnran was caught off guard. He was a little surprised, but he still maintained an innocent demeanour, \u201cHow could that be?\u201dAnran\u2019s calmness scared Mrs. Zhang down to her core. Her mind spun, and she began to speak uncontrollably, her volume getting louder the more she got agitated, \u201cWhy is this\u2013 day or night\u2013 it\u2019s been months! You didn\u2019t find any? And you, and you\u2013! You haven\u2019t even visited your Father! Do you know his condition right now? We took care of you for so many years. We didn\u2019t let you get wronged, we always try to cater to your every need! And this is how you repay us? Has your wolf heart been eaten by dogs1ungrateful person.?!\u201dEveryone in the live broadcast room who overheard this was far beyond surprised. They thought they were going to confront Jian Xingsui, so they didn\u2019t expect to get the truth about Anran instead.[What\u2019s the situation???][Is Mr. Zhang sick?][Wait, looking at their relationship\u2026 doesn\u2019t this mean that Anran and his former parents have a good relationship until now?][Oh my God.. what kind of plot development is it?? So many plot twists???]Even Xiao Zhang himself didn\u2019t expect the situation to escalate this way. He came here to expose Jian Xingsui, but he accidentally filmed this scene. He thought that with Zhang Xia and Anran, they would have a heartwarming reunion scene, not this kind of confrontation. Mrs. Zhang even almost cursed her beloved Anran!!After being scolded like this, Anran couldn\u2019t hold back his face.This was a small courtyard, and there was no one else outside, so he suddenly didn\u2019t bother to pretend. After all, the Zhang family had to rely on their own money for the medical treatment, so he concluded that the Zhang family wouldn\u2019t dare to turn against him now.Therefore, Anran\u2019s smile disappeared, and he spoke with an eerie soft voice, \u201cIsn\u2019t it right for Jian Xingsui to take care of you? Isn\u2019t he your biological son?\u201dZhang Xia exhaled deeply and said, \u201cAh, so you know that Jian Xingsui was taking care of us. How long do you think he was with us? Huh, how long? And yet, he was willing to be a filial son during this harsh time! Son, remember your earlier years. Tell me when we treated you badly! I used\u00a0 to wish I could give you all my heart! When you left home, we gave you most of our savings. And now, both your Father and I need you, how can you say such a thing now?\u201dAnran became more and more angry, but he still held back. After all, it\u2019s not good to tear his face, so he put out a hypocritical smile: \u201cMom, what are you talking about? I don\u2019t care about you anymore. I\u2019m working hard. If I don\u2019t find a suitable donor, can you blame me? Besides, you are the one who insisted on giving me the savings. I didn\u2019t ask for it, you know. Now I can slowly return the money to you, so that you don\u2019t owe me, and I don\u2019t owe you, right?\u201dZhang Xia\u2019s heart became cold when she heard Anran say these cold-blooded words.She took a half step back and looked at Anran in disbelief. For a moment, she felt as if she had never recognized this child clearly.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Mrs. Zhang\u2019s hands trembled a little, and tears rolled down: \u201cHow can you be like this? Where\u2019s your conscience? When I saw the hot search that you frame Suisui like that, I felt something was wrong. I was such a fool, why didn\u2019t I find out your rotten soul earlier?\u201dAnran sneered and said: \u201cMom, what do you mean? Isn\u2019t the hot search thing true? Jian Xingsui has really bullied me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what Weibo said!\u201d Mrs. Zhang roared angrily, \u201cHe may have asked you to clarify and argue, but he has never done anything to you. When you come home, there are no scars on your body. At most, he just accidentally bumped into you! Why did it say on Weibo that he physically and mentally bullied you? You are doing this now, do you want to kill his career? Your father and I now depend on him for our livelihood! If you cut his career path like this, what do you want? Do you also want to force us to death?\u201dMrs. Zhang yelled out all her grievances and injustices she felt inside her heart. It was easy for the live broadcast viewers to overheard. Of course, they were stunned by this unexpected revelation.The barrage in the live broadcast room was about to explode:[What the hell is going on?][Isn\u2019t Anran supposed to be the victim?][Didn\u2019t he basically confirmed the initial rumors? Why did it become like this? What\u2019s the truth??][Fuck.]Similarly, a group of rational viewers in the live broadcast room analyzed the matter:[If Jian Xingsui is the actual wronged party here, then Anran is beyond disgusting.][So Anran basically ran Weibo marketing to sell his image of a poor, bullied person; while Jian Xingsui was this vicious, unfilial bully.][It seems the truth was actually reversed. That vicious person was actually Anran all along.][Such a two-faced person\u2026 very different from his image in front of the camera!]Downstairs in the yard, Anran was also annoyed by Mrs. Zhang\u2019s aggressive attitude. Since Mrs. Zhang was going to tear her face off today, he was not afraid anymore. He let out a vicious sneer and said, \u201cMom, you just say that I am not filial to you. Think about my perspective. If you didn\u2019t switch me at birth, why would I be in your house?\u201dMrs. Zhang choked.\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s heartbreaking? Since I was a child, I couldn\u2019t afford to wear designer clothes, and I couldn\u2019t even take good dance classes. If I was in my original family, would I be like this? Yes, Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t bully me at all, but so what? I didn\u2019t have the ability before, but now I have it. I can do whatever I want, and you can\u2019t do shit about it!\u201d Anran completely let go of his mask, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel sorry for you, it\u2019s you who should feel sorry for me!\u201dHis usual fairy-boy appearance had completely vanished. He was very scary, like an angry ghost hellbent on revenge.Xiao Zhang upstairs stared wide-eyed in disbelief, and the netizens in the live broadcast room were even more excited. Originally, this was just a small and unknown live broadcast room, but because of this good show, it was directly promoted on the homepage as the current hot show. Currently, there are two millions viewers online. Slowly but surely, this became a hot discussion topic on Weibo, becoming its own hot search.Mrs. Zhang felt as if her chest was about to explode after hearing these words.After Anran finished speaking, he stepped forward again, looked at Mrs. Zhang with a cold gaze. He said in a mocking tone, \u201cMom, you are actually quite lucky sometimes. After all, if it wasn\u2019t for Dad\u2019s illness, Jian Xingsui wouldn\u2019t ever care for you two. Have you gone to do the paternity test? If you haven\u2019t, you still have enough guts to stand here and talk to me about righteousness?\u201dAnran purposefully dragged his sentence, enunciating every word extra clearly. The implication was clear to Zhang Xia.Mrs. Zhang looked at Anran in shock, her voice trembling: \u201cYou\u2026 you already\u2026\u201dAnran sneered complacently, knowing that his guess was right, so he said: \u201cSo, Mom, why do you dare to accuse me like this? Isn\u2019t it you who should be the most reflective person here? Well, if you don\u2019t want to admit it, then tell me \u2013 is Jian Xingsui your biological son?\u201dMrs. Zhang was cornered. Her hair was disheveled, and her body was trembling non-stop. At this moment, even if she didn\u2019t face Jian Xingsui or other people directly, she still didn\u2019t dare to admit it. She didn\u2019t want to face the sins she committed in the past.\u201cI\u2026he\u2026Of course he is of my own,\u201d Mrs. Zhang said softly, tears streaming down her face.Anran sneered, and was about to speak when the door to the backyard was pushed open.He turned around and saw Zhang Xiangyang and Jian Xingsui standing outside, their faces turned pale suddenly. He didn\u2019t know how much or how long they had heard.Jian Xingsui was also in a daze. He had doubts about his life experience, but he didn\u2019t expect to face all of this suddenly.Zhang Xiangyang beside him took a deep look at Jian Xingsui. Originally, he just wanted to spend this day peacefully, but he didn\u2019t expect that everything would crumble down today. Looking at his wife who kept crying in the yard, looking at the child who he raised but turned ruthless at this moment \u2013 it all seemed like a farce.They swapped someone else\u2019s child, so it\u2019s all retribution.Everything that goes around, will come around.And this farce should end today.\u201cEnough\u2026\u201d Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s body was very weak. But he still forced himself to take a few steps forward, walked up to his wife, and supported her. He looked at both Anran and Jian Xingsui.He sat down with Zhang Xia, and gave up trying to calm her down. Let her get all her emotions out by crying. He deeply sighed while his resolve became firm. He said to Jian Xingsui, \u201cXingsui, Zhang Xia and I must apologize to you. You are not our biological child.\u201d\u2014After those words fell, Anran\u2019s face turned pale. Jian Xingsui froze in place, and spoke with some difficulty: \u201cThen I\u2026\u201dZhang Xiangyang opened his mouth slowly, and the secret that had been hidden for many years was finally revealed in broad daylight, \u201cMore than 20 years ago, the child in A-Xia\u2019s stomach suffered a cardiac arrest not long after he was born. At that time, she sneaked out of the ward without any of us watching. No one thought that she actually brought back a child, and that child is Anran.\u201dThis was a long story.Normally, this conversation couldn\u2019t be overheard from such a distance. But in order to better expose Jian Xingsui\u2019s true face, Xiao Zhang secretly placed a wiretap in the small yard in advance. At this moment, all these words have been transmitted very clearly for the audience to witness themselves.On the Internet, the netizens went crazy with such developments. No one would have guessed that things would be so absurd and bizarre.At the same time, in the Shen family\u2019s house\u2013Shen Xingchen was looking for a way to inquire about Jian Xingsui\u2019s family, but he accidentally got into Xiao Zhang\u2019s live broadcast room thanks to the title and the \u201chot\u201d label on it. Originally, he wanted to call Jian Xingsui, but he was stopped by the scene he saw in the live broadcast room. He was so shocked that he couldn\u2019t speak.After digesting what this means, Shen Xingchen couldn\u2019t help but run to his Mother who was still cooking the chicken soup. Gasping for breath, he shouted, \u201cMom! Something is wrong! Jian Xingsui is not the biological child of the Zhang family!\u201dXu Enzhen\u2019s heart trembled. She raised her head, her heart beat uncontrollably and fast. She looked at the eager Shen Xingchen, and opened her lips, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?\u201d\u201cReally, really!\u201d Shen Xingchen knew that his Mother needed some evidence, so he told her all he heard from the live broadcast, \u201cThey said that Zhang Xia\u2019s child died of cardiac arrest, and then she ran out to steal someone else\u2019s child!\u201dXu Enzhen seemed unable to breathe at this moment, especially when she heard the word \u201csudden cardiac arrest\u201d. The blood in her body froze, and with a glimmer of hope in her heart, she asked, \u201cWhich hospital is it?\u201dShen Xingchen watched the live broadcast room again, and after Zhang Xiangyang finished speaking, he said: \u201cIt seems\u2026 what\u2019s it called again? Ah, yes, Zhongting Hospital.\u201d\u201cCrash!\u201dThe bowl in Xu Enzhen\u2019s hand fell and broke, the soup spilled all over the ground. Xu Enzhen froze in place, her long eyelashes started to tremble. She couldn\u2019t control her emotions, and soon, tears slid down her cheeks like broken beads.What Xiao Zhang is doing is basically doxxing Jian Xingsui. Befitting of a brainless Anran\u2019s admirer.1ungrateful person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 44.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayToday could be said to be a total anarchy on the Internet.After Zhang Xiangyang finished telling the story, because the live broadcast room was too hot, a lot of people even began to gather beside their courtyard. The appearance of these people also made Anran feel alert. Today, because of his private trip, he didn\u2019t bring along his personal mobile phone. He also had a habit of muting his work mobile phone during private times like this.He didn\u2019t expect that one day he would be harmed by this habit.After clicking on the screen, there were dozens of missed calls, and his WeChat messages were even more explosive. After clicking on it, the first thing that catches his eye was the messages from his agent:[Shut up and get out immediately! They are secretly filming a live broadcast upstairs!][Did you get carried away with your emotions?? Stupid!]When Anran found out that someone was secretly filming, his heart skipped a beat \u2013 all of a sudden, his whole body felt like jelly, and his mind blanked out. He wanted to pass out.Apart from his agent who sent him messages, the members of the Jian family also sent messages one after another, and the one who sent the most messages was naturally Jian Zhi: [What\u2019s going on? What are you talking about? What does this mean??]The second was Jian Kuo. His message was a bit different, instead he questioned: [Ranran,\u00a0 didn\u2019t you say that you have cut off contact with the Zhang family? Why do you still call them \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d?]This sentence also made Anran feel dizzy.The thing was, in the past, in order to establish his filial and sensible personality in front of others, and especially to please the Jian family members, he always said that he cut off any contact with the Zhang couple. But now, him calling Zhang Xia with \u201cMom\u201d was broadcast to the whole Internet to see!He already showed his true colors to the Zhang couple, but he couldn\u2019t afford to do the same with the Jian family!Anran quickly replied: [No, please just listen to me and I will explain to you later.]At this moment, he finally realized that this wasn\u2019t something he could explain even with a thousand words. He was so embarrassed, especially as he realized that this matter actually stemmed from his doing \u2013 dirtying Jian Xingsui\u2019s reputation in order to drive him out.There were neighbors gathered in the yard outside, and there were also people who came especially to see the shit going down live.The neighbors were a little bit emotional:\u201cSo these two children are both not biological?\u201d\u201cAt the beginning I hated Suisui\u2019s return. Sigh\u2026 I was a fool back then. The truth was so different from what I thought\u2026\u201d\u201cThat Jian Xingsui child is really pitiful.\u201dAnran was worried. He should escape now. He must go back to the company, and discuss with the PR department about the countermeasures of this shitshow. He also needed to explain and appease the Jian family.But when he opened the door and walked out, he was held back by someone.Xiao Zhang held Anran\u2019s hand and said: \u201cRanran!\u201dAnran was stunned: \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me, I went to the same school as you before. Don\u2019t you remember me? Ranran, I\u2019ve always missed you. I was in the courtyard just now. Was what you said true?\u201dAnran remembered that someone was secretly live broadcasting upstairs, but now he was anxious to leave. So he became very\u00a0 impatient with Xiao Zhang, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t remember, you get out of the way.\u201dXiao Zhang still didn\u2019t give up, \u201cRanran, I believe you are not that kind of person, can you explain to me?\u201dAnran frowned, clearly annoyed: \u201cWhy should I explain to you?\u201dXiao Zhang was stunned.In his memory, Anran has always been a gentle and kind boy. Hearing that he was bullied, Xiao Zhang immediately believed it. He has always had a belief that he should take good care of Anran and prevent him from being bullied. However\u2026 the Anran shown in front of him today seems to be a completely different person.He ran down without taking the live broadcast mobile phone, because he was anxious to prove to the audience that Ranran was innocent. For that reason, he also had a microphone on his body. Anran\u2019s impatient voice was heard in the live broadcast room, and the netizens were shocked:[Those who said that Anran was an angel, come out now!! Look at this \u201cangel\u201d of yours!!][How fierce!][Haha, Mr. Anchor, you are such a clown! Obviously, he was just using you as a spare tire at most!] [someone who likes person A, but person A purposefully left them hanging as a back-up candidate in case person A failed to get together with their separate love interest.][Anran\u2019s behavior was very strange\u2026][I\u2019m no longer his fan from this moment on.]When the netizens were discussing, the police car\u2019s siren rang not far away. At this exact time, the police\u2019s arrival drove some people to fever-pitch.The policeman got out of the car and said to the crowd around the small yard: \u201cPlease make a way, thank you.\u201dThe onlookers didn\u2019t expect this incident to alert the police. On the other hand, the police also didn\u2019t expect that there would be a day where they received a large number of reporting calls from enthusiastic citizens, all about the same incident. Now that they\u2019re here, the police could see how big of a spectacle the scene was.The courtyard door was pushed open, and Mrs. Zhang looked at the police who came in with some horror on her face.The leading policeman was a very experienced person. He showed his ID card and said, \u201cHello, I\u2019m a policeman. We have received a report hotline from enthusiastic citizens. We suspect that you are involved in a crime of child abduction. Please follow us.\u201dMrs. Zhang\u2019s face was full of tears, and she kept shrinking into Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s arms, \u201cI didn\u2019t participate, it\u2019s not my fault!\u201dZhang Xiangyang stood outside, blown by the wind, and kept covering his lips and coughing. His thin body trembled in the wind like dead leaves, looking scarily frail.Jian Xingsui happened to be standing next to him, so he went over to help him: \u201cAre you okay?\u201dBefore he was discharged from the hospital, the doctor told him that Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s condition was not very good, so he shouldn\u2019t get any emotional stimulation. But today, everything was exposed.Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s face was flushed, he patted Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand lightly, then raised his head and said to the policeman, \u201cThank you for your hard work. We are willing to accept the investigation, and we are also willing to accept every punishment demanded by the law.\u201dMrs. Zhang\u2019s eyes widened, and she slapped Zhang Xiangyang a few times, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Do you know what you are talking about? How could you\u2026\u201dZhang Xiangyang wanted to ask her not to act like this in front of the police. But he was anxious and felt pain all over his body. In the end, he couldn\u2019t hold it anymore \u2013 his vision got blurry, and he fell down, unconscious.Seeing her husband fainted, Mrs. Zhang was completely dumbfounded. She stood there in a daze, stunned.Fortunately, Jian Xingsui caught Zhang Xiangyang in time. He glared at Mrs. Zhang, and said in a cold voice, \u201cWhat are you doing? His condition is so serious, can you just stand still like this?\u201dThis was the first time that Jian Xingsui sternly scolded someone older than him. His dark eyes were full of unsaid reprimands, but there was a hint of sadness in his voice, \u201cStop being so selfish for a second! Help your husband now!\u201dThe truth always hurts the most, like a bullet pierced directly to her heart. But, Jian Xingsui was right, and Zhang Xia finally could agree to that.Her selfishness was engraved in her bones, and she was exposed in times of crisis. Jian Xingsui\u2019s words seemed to have taken away all the strength in her body. Zhang Xia took a deep breath, and the whole person sat paralyzed on the ground. She was unable to stand up.The police stepped forward quickly and said towards the fainted Zhang Xiangyang, \u201cTake him into the car and go to the hospital.\u201dJian Xingsui said, \u201cI\u2019ll carry him.\u201dSeeing that he took the initiative, the police nodded: \u201cOkay, thank you for your hard work.\u201dJian Xingsui shook his head: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to do.\u201dActually even before coming here, the policeman had a general understanding of what happened. He understood the setbacks and hardships this child had experienced. As a human with a fleshy heart, he couldn\u2019t be impartial \u2013 he hated the Zhang couple for the things they have done. But now, there\u2019s a human\u2019s life at stake, so he must hold back his hatred.He saw that Jian Xingsui\u2019s kindness was something innate in his soul. He was still able to feel sympathy and helped the man who basically indirectly ruined his life. The policeman couldn\u2019t help but admire this youth from the bottom of his heart.Going out from the yard, there were still many passers-by outside.The police cleared the way ahead. Jian Xingsui walked to the car with Zhang Xiangyang on his back. Passersby kept taking pictures with their mobile phones, and some people called his name. However, Jian Xingsui ignored them all and didn\u2019t stop.At this time, the Internet was busy with many discussions surrounding this:[Anran\u2026 ran away?][While I don\u2019t agree with the moral kidnapping Mrs. Zhang done to him, it\u2019s still very scummy of him to leave the people who raised him kindly for two decades. Especially seeing that Mr. Zhang was deathly sick.][Is this the guy you all said was pitiful?? Where the fuck do you see \u201cpitiful\u201d in this rat??][Suisui isn\u2019t blood-related to the Zhangs, he isn\u2019t the child who was raised for 20 years, but he still stayed until the end.][I still remembered that everyone was scolding Jian Xingsui yesterday. But today\u2026][I really can\u2019t tell what justice is.]When the falsehood on the Internet faded away, when the truth of the matter began to slowly unfold; all the people who hurled abuse and slander, all the righteous people who seek their own version of justice, all fell into a long, contemplative silence.The facts slapped them in the face. The echo of their empty talk was loud.They really shouldn\u2019t be the judge of a matter they didn\u2019t actually know.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nobody dared to move, afraid of destroying the delicate balance.Jian Xingsui wasn\u2019t in the mood for a small talk, the Zhang couple both fainted, and the policemen didn\u2019t dare to speak.Finally, they arrived at the hospital. There, Jian Xingsui and Zhang couples immediately took a sample of their blood and did a paternity test. And as for the fainted husband-wife pair, they both get the medical treatment they need.The police said to the youth, \u201cAs for the result, it will be able to come out in about one week. During this week, we will try our best to find out what happened back then and help you find your parents.\u201dJian Xingsui came out of the blood collection room. Hearing this made him feel a scrap of relief \u2013 the constant sense of unease slowly withered away, and now he could breathe freely, no longer burdened.\u201cReally?\u201d Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t even dare to be too happy, fearing it would be another of his elaborate delusions, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long, is it still possible to find my biological parents?\u201dThe policeman replied, \u201cOf course it\u2019s possible. It\u2019s a bit difficult, though, and the surveillance video from 20 years ago can\u2019t be found. So we can only retrieve the paperworks from back then. Since they replaced a child who died of a sudden cardiac arrest within a specific date, the scope of the search is quite limited. We will definitely investigate as soon as possible. Please be patient to wait for the results.\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t know why, but when he heard the policeman reassured him, a strange feeling flashed in his heart. It\u2019s as if\u2026 he had heard a similar story from somewhere before. But because he couldn\u2019t recall the connection, he could only nod his head and say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I understand. Thank you very much for helping me.\u201dThe doctor had informed them that Mrs. Zhang fell into a coma due to sheer psychological shock. Both husband and wife did not wake up, and the doctor advised to let them woke up naturally. Because both of them are suspects, the police have decided to send someone here to watch. And this policeman here was one of them. \u201cYou are welcome. You have no obligation to take care of them now. Since you have completed the formalities, you can go back and wait for our notice.\u201dJian Xingsui nodded slightly, \u201cOkay.\u201dWhat happened this morning was too magical, and he was a little bit overwhelmed.He needed a long, long rest. Not only his body was tired, his mind was too.He would\u00a0kill\u00a0for an undisturbed, full-day sleep.However, after walking out of the hospital, Jian Xingsui fell into confusion again. Since he was no longer a child of the Zhang family, where was he going now, where could he go?Where was the place he could call a home?Despite being bathed in the sun, he was cold all over. This feeling reminded him of the time when he was kicked out of Jian\u2019s house half a year ago. At that time, he was also lost. He chose to come to the Zhang\u2019s house, hoping to have a home. He was looking forward to having parents who love him.But\u2026 he never got them.An empty jar longed to be filled. That\u2019s what he was.He no longer dared to look forward to getting that familial love. He failed to get them two times already, why would he get them this time?What if\u2026 his biological parents already have another child, already building their perfect family unit? He wouldn\u2019t have a place \u2013 why would he, an outsider who suddenly appeared, be accepted?What if\u2026 his parents, his real biological parents, don\u2019t like him?Jian Xingsui had mixed feelings in his heart. He didn\u2019t want to think about it anymore, but the intrusive thoughts kept bothering him.At this time, his phone rang. He saw a perfect chance to avert his thoughts. He quickly picked up the phone and saw the ID of his agent. He accepted the call and heard Wang-ge\u2019s confused voice, \u201cSuisui, what\u2019s going on with you? \u201cJian Xingsui was caught off-guard by this question, \u201cWhat\u2026 what\u2019s going on? What do you mean?\u201dHis agent sighed and said: \u201cThe matter in the live broadcast room has exploded, and now the whole network is discussing this matter!\u201d\u201cAh, Really?\u201d Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t care about that live broadcast. He was busy talking with the police and getting that paternity test. He didn\u2019t have time to surf the Internet at all, so he only realized this now, \u201cWell, yeah, something did happen, but I really couldn\u2019t care about it now.\u201dUnexpectedly, Wang-ge was very happy, \u201cYou know, you are really popular on the Internet now! The higher-ups decided in an emergency meeting that they will no longer hide you. Now, many media outlets have contacted us about you. If we take advantage to ride this wave of popularity, we can get you good endorsements. No need to think much about it, come back quickly and I\u2019ll wait for you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui frowned, \u201cWhat kind of endorsement, I don\u2019t want to accept it for the time being.\u201dHis agent\u2019s earlier happy mood dissipated, \u201cWhat are you talking about? You don\u2019t even have any money, why would you let go of such a golden opportunity like this? And the endorsement is for commercials, what else?\u00a0 I want to ask you to be a guest star in a variety show, and since you are so popular now, I think\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui found it funny the more he heard it. When he was scolded by the whole Internet, the company didn\u2019t know where he was. When the reversal happened, the company was eager to jump out and use him to make money. When he was getting successful in \u201cStarlight\u201d survival show, the company agreed on a one million yuan deal without asking him, and even wanted him to retire for the sake of that money. They even got as far as to snow him in.Capitalism at its finest, indeed.\u201cWang-ge, there is actually something I didn\u2019t tell you before.\u201d Jian Xingsui said with full conviction, \u201cActually, I want to terminate the contract with the company.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you all want to snow me in before? I originally\u00a0 wanted to fade out of the entertainment industry, so I didn\u2019t have any objections about this decision. But now that is no longer the case, I want to terminate my contract.\u201d Jian Xingsui elaborated, a slight hint of anger tinted his voice.When he said this, Wang-ge frothed in the mouth. He hurriedly say, \u201cJian Xingsui, are you crazy? The company hasn\u2019t settled with you for the million-yuan matter. You dare to terminate the contract?? Let me tell you this. Termination is fine, but liquidated damages must be paid in full. Can you afford it?\u201dJian Xingsui was immediately caught, he had no money.Seeing that Jian Xingsui was silent, his agent knew he had found his weakness. With a prideful voice, he said, \u201cAs the saying goes, those who know current affairs are brilliant. Suisui, I don\u2019t want to embarrass you, but you have to think clearly. You can\u2019t do whatever you want in this circle. If you want to terminate the contract, if you don\u2019t want to cooperate with the company, you can\u2019t! Be realistic!\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s chest was stuffy, and he felt a bit of bitterness.His agent continued his lecture with glee, \u201cI think you may have to adjust your mood today, I understand how big of an impact today was, so cool your head first. How about this, I will give you a vacation and rest for today. I will see you at the company tomorrow. Just be obedient and go along with the company\u2019s plans for you. I advise you not to try to fight against the company, if you don\u2019t want to see them in court. Believe me, things will get ugly for you.\u201dJian Xingsui was silent. Scarily so.Without saying a word, his agent wisely hung up the phone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jian Xingsui was holding his mobile phone, but his arm felt boneless, so it was a struggle to keep it on face level. He was originally sitting on a chair, but now he wanted to stand up. However, the excessive fatigue and the shock of his mind prevented him. When he just stood up, there was blackness in front of his eyes, and his whole body fell back on the chair again.Jian Xingsui closed his eyes uncomfortably, and wanted to rest on the chair. For a while, the whole world was dark, and he wanted to find a closed space to shrink himself up, to slowly digest these revelations and emotions.At this time, suddenly, a call came from not far away: \u201cJian Xingsui!\u201dThe voice was so strong that Jian Xingsui, who was sitting on the chair, was jolted awake. As he slowly opened his eyes, the light of the world returned to his line of sight. On the tree-lined road not far away, the afternoon sun shone on Shen Xingchen\u2019s family members. His eyes were a little uncomfortable under the sunlight, and Jian Xingsui\u2019s eye felt moist.Shen Xingchen ran over to him in small steps, and complained, \u201cyou don\u2019t answer my phone calls, and you don\u2019t reply to my text messages. What kind of big, busy celeb are you? You\u2019re worse than Fu-ge!\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s eyes widened, and he realized: \u201cXingchen\u2026 why are you here?\u201dNot only Shen Xingchen, but also Xu Enzhen appeared, Shen Minglang, and a stern-looking man who looked similar to the brothers. If his guess was correct, this man should be the head of the Shen Conglomerate, Shen Yong.While Jian Xingsui was still in a daze, Xu Enzhen trotted over. This was the first time that Jian Xingsui saw this\u2014the always dignified and reserved lady walked over with some eager steps. Her eyes reflected Jian Xingsui\u2019s figure, and when she approached, she held Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand and called softly, \u201cMy son\u2026\u201dWhen Xu Enzhen touched Jian Xingsui\u2019s cold hand, she hadn\u2019t seen him for half a month. When she saw that the boy was distressingly thinner, tears fell uncontrollably. She couldn\u2019t imagine what this boy had experienced during this period of time.Seeing her crying, Jian Xingsui suddenly felt pain in his heart, and quickly said: \u201cIs\u2026 something wrong?\u201d\u201cMy\u2026 third son, my actual youngest child\u2026 at that time, not long after he was born, the doctor told me that the child died of cardiac arrest.\u201dJian Xingsui suddenly opened his eyes wide and froze in place stiffly.He almost couldn\u2019t believe what he heard. His heart was beating violently, hand clammy with sweat, his Adam\u2019s apple rolled up and down. A tiny spark of hope flickered in the depths of his heart, something that he wanted to extinguish right away so he won\u2019t get disappointed later. He asked with a trembling voice, \u201cThen\u2026 what\u2019s the connection to me?\u201dShen Yong came over, he put his arms around his wife\u2019s shoulders. He took a good look at the boy standing in front of him. He was small, the tip of his head was about taller than his shoulder. He immediately emphatized with his wife. \u201cYour birthday is the same day as his.\u201dThis sentence stopped Jian Xingsui\u2019s breathing.Sometimes fate was like a mischievous ghost \u2013 really good at toying with people. Just now, he felt like he was free-falling into a deep, underground ice cave. But at this moment, he felt like he was caught by a net mid-fall, then wrapped in a thick, cozy blanket.But he remembered that good things would always be followed by bad things. He quickly suppressed his delusions. Clenching his hand, he subconsciously took two steps back. He still spoke cautiously: \u201cBut it may not be me, there are many people who were born in this hospital that day, in case it wasn\u2019t me\u2026\u201dXu Enzhen, who had always been weak, suddenly took a step forward, and said firmly, \u201cNo, it is you. I know it is you.\u201dThings like \u201cintuition\u201d and \u201cgut feelings\u201d were something very mysterious. But Xu Enzhen believed it, as a mother who could sense an inexplicable feeling about this child. She carried her third child for months inside her womb. She knew she couldn\u2019t be wrong about this.Shen Xingchen was a little dazed at first, but he quickly reacted and cursed, \u201cI just said that we look so alike, I almost thought my dad was having an illegitimate child outside!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d There was silence all around at this moment.Shen Xingchen has the ability to mess up the atmosphere. Shen Yong, who looked quite serious, glanced at his second son lightly, full of threats.Shen Xingchen touched his nose resentfully, and shut up obediently.Xu Enzhen stepped forward and said softly, \u201cWhen I saw you on the screen for the first time, I was thinking: this child looks so cute, I can\u2019t get enough of watching him\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s eyes felt stuffy, and he knew that he was on the verge of crying.He was the vicious cannon fodder of this world, where Anran was the protagonist. Because of that, he seemed to be born with an unflattering debuff. No matter who saw him, their first impression would be bad. He gradually got used to this, and even half-expected this with every person he came across.But today, someone told him that when she saw it for the first time, she instantly liked him.Xu Enzhen sighed softly, \u201cYou, Xingchen, and Minglang all share some similar traits. But, your eyebrows and eye-shape are more like mine. Maybe, I always subconsciously treated you as my own son. At that time, I often wondered why you are so thin? Was the pressure during training too heavy? Did you eat well\u2026?\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s heart tightened up uncomfortably, lips still trembling.Xu Enzhen walked in front of him, her slender and white hands were slowly raised\u00a0 and stretched out tremblingly. It landed on both sides of Jian Xingsui\u2019s cheeks. Tears glistened in her eyes, and she sighed with distress in her voice: \u201cIt\u2019s only been half a month since we parted, why did you lose weight again?\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s breathing collapsed due to tension, he panted quickly, and said, \u201cIn\u2026 in the past half a month\u2026\u00a0 Zhang Xiangyang was sick and hospitalized. He\u2026 uhm\u2026 he needed someone to take care of him, and something happened on the Internet, so I lived a busy life. Actually, you don\u2019t have to worry, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201dIn Xu Enzhen\u2019s gentle eyes, Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t want to explain much. But people were very strange \u2013 when a child fell down, even if the fall hurts, if no one pays attention to you, you may be able to get over it by patting your knees. But if you comfort that small child with a soft, understanding voice, suddenly, the pain in the child\u2019s heart eclipsed the physical pain. The child might cry, but they would end up feeling better.That also happened with Jian Xingsui. The pressure he felt during the past half-month felt bearable when he was carrying it inside his heart. After all, he wasn\u2019t the type to cry easily. If there\u2019s one thing that life had taught him, it was that tears wouldn\u2019t solve the problem, and no one would feel sorry for him.But the moment Xu Enzhen spoke gently to him, he crumbled. Lips trembling, nose felt sour, he tried to stop a choked sob in his throat. But in the end, the dam broke. Tears started cascading down his eyes, the grievances in his heart crashed around like a tidal wave, drawing all other emotions beside grief.Seeing the child crying, Xu Enzhen was heartbroken. With an equally trembling voice, she hugged the child tight, and tried to comfort him, \u201cSuisui, it was Mom\u2019s fault that bad things happened to you. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s whole body was racked with uncontrollable sobs. Despite that, he returned the hug, encircled his arm around his Mother\u2019s warm body. The temperature was real. This was real. He really had a mother who loved him.There have been many moments where he drowned in his fantasy, in his delusion. In that made-up world, his parents unconditionally love him. They would soothe him when he cried, would protect him when he got into trouble, would comfort him when he felt lonely and helpless.In fact, he was very, very, very jealous of the protagonist. He wanted to be Anran, to be surrounded by people who understood and loved him with all their heart.He didn\u2019t need to be popular, to be rich, to reach the pinnacle of life like Anran did. He just\u2026 wanted a place, a person, a safe haven where he could take shelter from the wind.It\u2019s just such a small wish.Just like Fu Jinxiao, just like Wang-ge\u2018s inquiry, he didn\u2019t care about money and interests anymore. There\u2019s only one thing he lacked in this life, and he desperately wanted to cover up the hole it left in his heart.He wanted to be loved. He wanted someone who understood him. He wanted someone who wouldn\u2019t leave him the moment someone better appeared.Xu Enzhen gently sniffed, and lightly patted Jian Xingsui\u2019s trembling body, her voice was firm and gentle: \u201cMom is here. And I\u2026 and I will not let anyone hurt you again\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so late\u2026 please forgive Mom\u2026\u201dThe gentle words and a mother\u2019s embrace seemed to have magically relaxed Jian Xingsui\u2019s tense state.Xu En was really worried, when he suddenly heard a soft, murmured voice: \u201cMom\u2026\u201dThis murmur made Xu Enzhen freeze in place.When she took a step back and raised her face to look at Jian Xingsui, she saw caution in the child\u2019s flushed eyes. The thing was, there\u2019s still a last block inside his heart \u2013 the paternity test still hasn\u2019t been done between him and the Shen family. So\u2026 what if he\u2019s not their son? Would all of this\u2026 just gone again?He couldn\u2019t afford another heartbreak.But still\u2026 he hoped. He hoped harder than ever before in his life. With a bit of courage, he asked for permission, \u201c\u2026can I, can I call you Mom? Just this once?\u201dThat soft call struck her whole body. It pierced her heart and soul, making her cry harder. She had been waiting for far too long for his youngest child to call her this. It has been twenty long years.\u201cYes.\u201d Xu Enzhen held his hand, as if she was afraid that Jian Xingsui would disappear into thin air. \u201cYou always can\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 45.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter a small story climax, it\u2019s time for a winding down section.Jian Xingsui has never experienced such great joy and sorrow in his life.The Shen family and him wasted no time to do another paternity test. Despite knowing it in their heart, a physical proof was still needed in the eyes of the law. When taking the elevator, Xu Enzhen was standing next to Jian Xingsui, refusing to be separated from him again.Jian Xingsui had just come out of the blood collection room, but he\u2019s going inside again. The policeman who was still inside the hospital was a little surprised when he saw him come back: \u201cYou\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui bowed, hesitating how to speak.However, Shen Yong stood up. This man was relatively silent most of the time, but when something happened, he was always the first to stand up. He whispered: \u201cGood afternoon. We want to do a paternity test.\u201dThe policeman gasped in surprise.Not long ago, they were still preparing to investigate the paperworks to help Jian Xingsui find his family members faster. They didn\u2019t expect that Jian Xingsui actually found a family to come for a paternity test with his own strength! And so fast too!Xu Enzhen also said with some emotion behind her: \u201cYes, we are going to bring him for a paternity test.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The police hesitated and said, \u201cAre you sure?\u201dShen Yong nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dShen Yong turned his head. His tall body, standing slightly sideways in front of the policeman at this moment, was separating the policeman and Jian Xingsui. He was like a big, reliable mountain. He couldn\u2019t be questioned, only followed. With his deep voice, he spoke sternly, \u201cHe is our youngest son.\u201dThe policeman was also infected by this temperament, and he could only agree. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do it.\u201dThe mood this time is completely different from the previous one.After Jian Xingsui finished, the whole day\u2019s hard work made him dizzy again when he stood up after another blood draw.The doctor said in a chiding tone, \u201cYoung man, you have to pay attention to your body. Look at the color of your blood. It\u2019s obvious you need a proper rest as soon as possible. You might have some form of anemia also, please pay attention to your diet. You are still young, but that\u2019s not a reason to have an unhealthy habit.\u201dJian Xingsui nodded lightly: \u201cI will follow your advice.\u201dXu Enzhen behind him also heard it. This was the child she found with great difficulty, she couldn\u2019t bear for him to be wronged even for a little bit. Her voice had a visible distress as she asked, \u201cDoctor, is our child not in good health? What kind of check-up do we need to do?\u201dThe doctor smiled and shook his head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. He is young and in good health. He doesn\u2019t have any health problems, he just needs rest and a good diet moving forward. Otherwise, he might fall sick.\u201dXu Enzhen nodded quickly, \u201cOkay, I understand.\u201dShen Xingchen from behind was annoyed after hearing this: \u201cDid that Zhang Xia abuse you and deny you food?\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s just\u2026 the financial condition is tight, so a sacrifice here and there has to be made.\u201dShen Xingchen kept grilling him because he knew Jian Xingsui was downplaying his suffering, \u201cThen what do you eat? Boxed lunches sold around the hospital?\u201dIn fact, Shen Xingchen wanted to list the nutritional benefits of those boxed lunches sold outside, but who knew that Jian Xingsui would instead say, \u201cNo, I cooked some dried noodles at home, or steamed some rice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShen looked at his thin body, getting even more anxious and angrier, \u201cYou\u2019re a dumbass. Why don\u2019t you at least buy proper food for yourself!\u201dJian Xingsui smiled wryly.Behind him was Shen Minglang, who was much smarter than Shen Xingchen. He had always been well-informed, so he could guess the current situation of the Zhang family. Therefore, he could naturally guess why Jian Xingsui had to eat so poorly.Xu Enzhen\u2019s heart ached so much, her eyes were red again, she pulled Jian Xingsui and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go home, Mom will cook for you.\u201dSeeing her sadness, Jian Xingsui quickly comforted her with a few more words.When all five of them came back from the hospital, they didn\u2019t expect to see a bunch of crowds gathered around the exit. They were here to see the continuation of that live broadcast shitshow. Alongside them, there were also several police cars parked there. They must be the policemen who was assigned to the Zhang family case.The thing was, ever since that live broadcast exploded, it attracted many people\u2019s attention. They wanted to know the actual truth, and finding them through another person was no longer reliable. They had to see it with their own eyes. Mixed among them were the paparazzi, whose keen nose smelt a scent of a big news worthy for a headline.Jian Xingsui was not far from the door, and was shocked to see so many people outside the hospital.Someone saw his figure from a distance and shouted: \u201cIt\u2019s Jian Xingsui!\u201dThe crowd responded, and they all wanted to rush over for interviews and to get first-hand accounts.\u00a0 Thankfully, there was still a distance between him and the crowd before people started piling him up with questions:\u201cYou\u2019re not blood-related at all with the Zhang family?\u201d\u201cThen who are your biological parents?\u201d\u201cAre you and Anran at odds?\u201d\u201cSo the bullying scandal was really only Anran\u2019s fabrication?\u201dJian Xingsui was overwhelmed by the sudden crowd.Someone sneaked in and wanted to get closer, but was stopped by Shen Xingchen. The young master wasn\u2019t afraid to look bad in front of the camera, so he scolded all of them with a loud, booming voice, \u201cDo you have a hundred mouths or what? Why do you talk so much?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The crowd didn\u2019t know how to respond.Shen Xingchen glared at the rude, insensitive crowd. He was pissed because this was a violation of privacy, \u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you all want to know the truth? You already arrived here, why do you stop asking now?\u201dSome people came over to ask questions, and Shen Xingchen went all out, \u201cGo ask me if you dare. See if I give you an answer. Tch. Who do you think you are, huh? Asking us about this matter?\u201dThere were also passersby who were concerned about Jian Xingsui and the progress of this matter. Among them, a girl finally squeezed in. After hearing Shen Xingchen\u2019s words, she was a little displeased, \u201cI\u2019m a fan, I just care about Suisui. Why? Is it wrong for me to worry about him?\u201dShen Xingchen was accused. Mixed that with his natural ill-temper, he exploded. He was about to go back when he heard this, so he stopped moving.He was the one who protected Jian Xingsui before, so it was a pure reflex for him to do the same again. However, he was facing Jian Xingsui\u2019s fan, so he couldn\u2019t unleash all of his anger on her. His face reddened in bottled anger, but he still tried to be milder.Instead, Jian Xingsui decided to handle his fans by himself. With a soft voice, he greeted her, \u201cHello. You said that you are my fan?\u201dThe girl nodded.\u201cThank you for caring about me. I\u2019m fine now, but what I want to tell you is that it\u2019s wrong to stay here in the hospital.\u201d Jian Xingsui\u2019s voice was clear and clean. Although it\u2019s near winter, he could see the girl was sweating. It\u2019s natural, seeing the sheer volume of people gathered here. He took out a wet tissue from his pocket and handed it to the girl, asking her to wipe the thin sweat off her face. Then he said, \u201cThe hospital is a place where patients receive treatment, and absolute silence is required. Staying here will cause trouble to others.\u201dThe girl hesitated and said, \u201cBut I\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui continued to gently scold her, \u201cIf the behavior of my fans ended up disturbing others, it will also reflect badly on my image. Since you are my fan, you definitely don\u2019t want this to happen, right?\u201dThe girl nodded dumbfoundedly.Jian Xingsui smiled and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back, then.\u201dThe originally complicated matter seemed to be dissuaded by a few words, but the girl still didn\u2019t give up. She still was displeased with Shen Xingchen. She glanced at him and muttered, \u201cHe\u2019s too fierce, why do you let him speak for you?\u201dShen Xingchen was about to speak, when Jian Xingsui said naturally, \u201cOf course he can speak for me.\u201dThe girl looked up in surprise, Jian Xingsui\u2019s eyebrows and eyes were much gentler, but his voice was firm: \u201cBecause he is my older brother.\u201dThis was the first time, in front of the public, in front of the camera, that Jian Xingsui called Shen Xingchen with \u201cbrother\u201d. Although Shen Xingchen had called Jian Xingsui his \u201cdidi\u201d, Jian Xingsui only accepted it with a wry smile without returning the favor. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t like it nor accept it, it\u2019s just that he felt that he didn\u2019t deserve it.But today, at this very moment, he finally called Shen Xingchen with his proper title.Shen Xingchen was stunned. He looked sideways at Jian Xingsui, and saw that his younger brother was quite calm when facing the fans. But after calling him brother, his earlobes turned red from embarrassment.Shen Xingchen smiled, slinging his arm around Jian Xingsui\u2019s shoulders. He got very boisterous, very excited, like a sugar-high kid in front of his favorite toy, \u201cDid you hear that, did you hear that? This is my didi, can\u2019t tell, can\u2019t you tell? Hahahaha!\u201dThe fans: \u201c\u2026\u201dThey have never been so speechless in their life.As the confrontation was taking place, Shen Yong also talked with the police and security personnel on his phone. After a while, someone came over to maintain order. Before, these people were wandering outside the hospital gate, so they didn\u2019t attract attention. But now, they were crowded near the exit, so this would cause public unrest. So it was natural that someone would disperse them.As Shen Xingchen walked towards the parking place, he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m the first one he called \u201cge\u201d !!\u201dShen Minglang and Shen Yong next to him: \u201c\u2026\u201dBoth of them glanced at Shen Xingchen coolly, a dangerous glint appeared on their eyes.They were jealous!These two people were not like Xu Enzhen and Shen Xingchen, who can express their emotions so enthusiastically and frankly. Although they also loved Jian Xingsui the same, they didn\u2019t know how to outwardly express it.In the end, Shen Xingchen seized the opportunity, while they lost the race. Jian Xingsui called Shen Xingchen with a familial appellation first.Xu Enzhen walked beside them, and also pursed her lips and smiled, \u201cHe called me Mom too.\u201dShen Minglang and Shen Yong: \u201c\u2026\u201dIt was like being stabbed again.When they finally reached the parking place, they naturally took the Shen family\u2019s car. It was a modified version of a Rolls Royce, and there was no problem at all for five people to sit inside comfortably.After Shen Xingchen got into the car, he complained, \u201cWe don\u2019t usually use this car.\u201dJian Xingsui looked at him in confusion of his implication.Shen Yong, who was sitting next to his wife, finally found an opportunity to show off, and replied in a deep voice: \u201cWe pick this car because it\u2019s the biggest. After all, we are here to pick you up.\u201dShen Minglang pushed his glasses, and then rushed to answer, \u201cThis way you won\u2019t get crowded in the car.\u201dShen Yong and Shen Minglang were the stern, respected, feared figures in the business world. Other people usually looked them up in awe, while the father-son duo looked like as if mortal matters couldn\u2019t bother them.But this time, facing their newly found family, they started to fight for his favor like children playing house in kindergarten.Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t notice the atmosphere. He heard everyone\u2019s answers, and he felt hot and moved in his heart, filled with happiness. They didn\u2019t even see the results of their paternity test, but they treated him this well.It made him terrified, but happy.\u2026those crowd of insensitive people is another villain I think.

So, there will be 3 chapter uploads at Tuesday!Returning to the Shen family\u2019s house, it was the first time that Jian Xingsui came back again after a month.Different from the previous temporary stay, this time he came back as a part of the family. Jian Xingsui stepped on the garden path and walked into the gate, his hand was held by Xu Enzhen all the time.Shen Xingchen cheerfully said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner later!\u201dXu Enzhen took Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand and said, \u201cMy son, let\u2019s go, I\u2019ll take you to see your room.\u201dJian Xingsui hesitated, \u201cMy own\u2026 room?\u201dXu Enzhen nodded, and replied: \u201cOf course!\u201dShen Yong handed his suit jacket to Auntie Wu, and told Jian Xingsui while changing his shoes: \u201cIt was prepared for you when you were born, and it has been kept all these years. \u201cJian Xingsui\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.He was dragged up to the second floor by Xu Enzhen, and the moment the door of the room was opened, he froze in place, mouth open without a sound.The room was spacious and bright, with big floor-to-ceiling windows, and small blue curtains hanging covering the windows. The beds were neatly made with fresh sheets. Beside that, there was a small desk, small wardrobe, and through the wardrobe\u2019s transparent door, he could see many stacks of small, baby clothes.But those weren\u2019t the things that shocked him the most.On the carpeted floor, on the cabinets, stacked on the desk\u2026 were all unopened gift boxes, all still wrapped neatly with festive papers.Xu Enzhen whispered, \u201cEvery year, Mom prepared a gift for you. And it\u2019s been\u2026 quite long, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s becoming quite a tall pile now.\u201dShe took a step forward and walked to those gifts. She picked them up one by one, while muttering, \u201cThis is a gold lock bracelet, this is a toy car, this is a limited edition Ultraman suit, this is a small scarf and clothes I knitted myself, this is the latest game console a decade back, this is a complete fairy tale collection, and this\u2014\u201dWhile listing all the ungifted presents, Xu Enzhen\u2019s eyes began to feel sore again. The sad memories came back like a deluge, making her remember those lonely days where she picked a gift for her dead child despite everyone trying to softly prevent her. Now that the gifts were slowly getting opened, she should be happy, but still, her tears dripped down slowly.Some of those gifts were prepared many, many years ago. They were very old, but they were still in great condition. It\u2019s clear that Xu Enzhen very often dusted them off and made sure they were still usable.Xu Enzhen was a little choked up, a messy mixture of sadness and joy, but she still continued talking, \u201cEverytime the date is near, Mom always thinks about how old you would be. What would you like? But Mom doesn\u2019t know that, so I could only guess\u2026\u201dHalfway through her words, someone knelt down in front of her and held her hand.Xu Enzhen raised her head and met Jian Xingsui\u2019s clear eyes. Her own reflection was reflected in his eyes \u2013 a frail woman with reddened, puffy eyes.Her son said in a comforting tone, \u201cI like them, I like them all very much.\u201dJian Xingsui reached out for one of the oldest gifts. He carefully traced the old, unopened box with a sad smile. His voice was almost inaudible, broken by a sob he swallowed down, \u201cThank you, Mom.\u201dXu Enzhen\u2019s heart was filled with joy and happiness in an instant, and she let out a muffled squeal of joy. She hugged Jian Xingsui tightly, both were now kneeling on the ground, surrounded by a huge pile of gift boxes.Over the years, she has never let herself go, living in the shadows and standing still. No one could empathize with the grief of a mother who lost her child. In her eyes, everyone around her was slowly able to restart their own lives. Everyone was moving forward, except her. She was left behind, alone, with a hole in her heart that died out when her baby died.Everyone said that she had a mental problem, that she should restrain her grief and try to move on. The dead couldn\u2019t be brought back to the land of the living. She should look forward, if only for the sake of her two living sons. She didn\u2019t need to be taught this kind of truth, didn\u2019t she understand it herself?It\u2019s not that she was not aware of how unhealthy her obsession was. It\u2019s just that\u2026 she\u2019s afraid if she \u201cmoved on\u201d, it meant she abandoned her youngest son. She felt that by remembering him, it meant that she truly loves him.For her, sustaining herself by sheer delusion was enough. She could live on the dream she built herself.\u201cSuisui\u2026\u201d Xu Enzhen\u2019s voice was a little hoarse, but it seemed that she finally said what couldn\u2019t say all these years, \u201cMom is at fault\u2026 can you forgive me?\u201dIn her eyes, if she was just more insistent on seeing her baby, if she was just more stubborn in digging up the truth, if she just followed her guts and asked for a paternity test with that dead baby\u2026 maybe\u2026Her spiralling mind was cut short by a gentle voice bringing her back, reminding her of the reality.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom. It\u2019s all over. It\u2019s all over\u2026\u201dXu Enzhen seemed to have finally let go of the big rock blocking her heart.Shen Xingchen suddenly came behind both of them. He barreled without manners, bringing a sunshine inside with him, \u201cMom, it\u2019s okay to cry, but let\u2019s stop for now, mkay? It\u2019ll hurt your body. Besides, we will have dinner downstairs in a while.\u201d\u201cOhhh hey, hey, why do you only introduce the things you bought yourself? I bought gifts for my didi too!\u201dThis young master was an expert at destroying the atmosphere. Jian Xingsui was glad for this attribute of his.Jian Xingsui looked at him in surprise, and asked in confusion, \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dShen Xingchen walked to the cabinet next to him, opened it, and said, \u201cDang dang dang! I bought these gifts for you! I have had pocket money since I was five years old, so as an exemplary gege1if you don\u2019t know my own internal rule on using \u201colder brother\u201d vs \u201cge/gege\u201d it\u2019s this: if it\u2019s used in a dialogue for addressing someone, I use the Chinese term. For anything else, I use the translated version., I have to use a portion of it for spoiling my didi!\u201dShen Xingchen was the only one in the family who didn\u2019t know the birthday of his dead younger brother, but he would also leave a birthday present for his younger brother every year on his own birthday.\u201cLook at this, Kingkong toy!\u201d\u201cOhhh I remember this, this is a small toy airplane I made myself, aren\u2019t I amazing?\u201d\u201cAnd this, a clay sculpture of Doraemon.\u201dIn addition to these, there are many precious things in this cabinet. It was given from Shen Yong and Shen Minglang. The doctor said that Xu Enzhen had a mental problem, and it\u2019s best to help her move one. No one in the family chose the \u201chard\u201d approach, and instead, they supported her endeavor in remembering her child, and helped commemorate every birthday with her. They hoped that if she knew that her family supported them, it would lessen her guilt, and make her able to move on easier.Shen Minglang also came inside the room. He stood in front of the cabinet and said in a low voice, \u201cI also gifted you from your first birthday to your twentieth. Here\u2026 are all of them. The most precious of which is this painting \u2013 this is a collection I bought in country M2probably referring to America, and it\u2019s one of a kind. It is considered priceless now, and it is said to be a good-luck charm. It can keep people self, and protect them from danger, or so the rumors go.\u201dAs expected of the big brother who always talked about money and interests, he still didn\u2019t forget to introduce the value of the gift even during this moment.On the surface, Shen Minglang was stating that every gift was valuable. But in fact, he was trying to get extra favors from Jian Xingsui, by hinting that his gift is the best and the most thoughtful. He wanted to be the next person in the family to be called with a familial appellation. At least, he wanted to win against his father.It\u2019s a pity that Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t understand this hidden meaning. His mind was still muddled from all his emotional roller-coaster, so he could only say, \u201cThank you, thank you\u2026\u201dShen Minglang still hadn\u2019t given up, though,\u00a0 \u201c\u2026no need to give me thanks. It\u2019s my duty as an older brother.\u201dJian Xingsui was a little nervous in facing Shen Minglang. Just as he was about to change his words, Shen Yong stepped forward and pulled up his wife and children who were squatting on the ground. This was the first time he met Jian Xingsui today, but as the patriarch of the family and the head of a whole conglomerate, he was very used to keeping his composure in face of everything. Standing in front of Jian Xingsui, he lowered his head and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so polite, this will be your home from now on.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s hand subconsciously curled up.He lowered his head, but Shen Yong\u2019s palm covered his head, his deep voice was a bit solemn, and it contained the imperceptible tenderness of a father towards his child, \u201cI\u2019m not showing you these gifts to make you sad. I just want to tell you that you have always been a part of this family, and we are all looking forward to welcoming you home.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s body shook. He had been worrying about these things, but unexpectedly his insecurities were seen through in a glance. The feeling of being understood and cared for tenderly made him a little at a loss, and his eyes turned red instantly.Shen Yong wanted to say something, but there was a knock on the door outside.Auntie Wu said as she knocked on the door, \u201cSir, Madam, Young Masters, the food is ready.\u201dShen Xingchen cheered, \u201cThat\u2019s great, I\u2019ve starved to death a long time ago .\u201dShen Minglang instantly snarked at him, \u201cYou just ate not long ago. What kind of celebrity are you? A pig?\u201dJian Xingsui was standing between them, and he was a bit terrified at what to do.Xu Enzhen pursed her lips and smiled. She came over and stretched out her hand to interrupt the quarrel between the two of them, \u201cOkay, okay, don\u2019t press Suisui. You two are overweight, you\u2019ll crush him.\u201dShen Xingchen yelled indignantly, \u201cMooooom! Why are you like this? Do you also despise me for being fat!\u201dThe family walked downstairs while bickering. Although it was a bit noisy, it was a pleasant buzz against his ear. It felt like this was what a family should sound like. Jian Xingsui\u2019s mind was blank, as was used to being alone. The moment he was surrounded by excitement, it felt unreal so he just\u2026 became silent.Someone patted him on the back.Jian Xingsui turned around, Xu Enzhen held his hand and said, \u201cWhat are you thinking, Suisui? As for dinner, I made chicken soup before I left. There should be egg noodles today. Mom will serve you a bowl later, okay?\u201dJian Xingsui squeezed her hand back, trying to ground himself in this unreal reality.He threw away his insecurity, even if just for a moment, nodded at his mother, and responded, \u201cOkay!\u201d1if you don\u2019t know my own internal rule on using \u201colder brother\u201d vs \u201cge/gege\u201d it\u2019s this: if it\u2019s used in a dialogue for addressing someone, I use the Chinese term.

    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 45.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day\u2013The viral, nation-wide sensation of that live broadcast actually brought upon a hidden secret \u2013 the twenty-years-old crime of child abduction. Because of how it went down, the whole nation more or less had heard of it. And today, the ruling of that crime was to be held in court.Because the two parties involved in the case were both small celebrities who have become popular recently, this case had received widespread attention. On the day of the trial, the court was crowded with people applying for the rights to watch, and countless people on the Internet were waiting for the final court ruling to be given to the Zhang couple.When the judge announced the trial results, the audience was silent.The accused Zhang Xia, who abducted and trafficked children about twenty1tbh, the author was switching between 20 and 21, so I chose 20 because JXS\u2019 latest birthday (from what I remembered) was his 20th. years ago, caused tragedies to two families. After being arrested, she had a bad attitude and showed no remorse. She was sentenced to life imprisonment without a chance of parole, and confiscation of all her property.The judge\u2019s hammer fell, and the case was settled.As Zhang Xia was being escorted to the prison, she saw Jian Xingsui, who was standing not far away, watching her quietly with an indescribable look in his eyes.She suddenly struggled madly, rushed to Jian Xingsui in small steps, and said in a very excited tone: \u201cSuisui, Suisui, you are here.\u201dJian Xingsui looked at her quietly, didn\u2019t know what to say, \u201cUm.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s Ranran?\u201d Mrs. Zhang looked around and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t Ranran come?\u201dJian Xingsui gave her an honest answer, \u201cHe didn\u2019t come.\u201dIn fact, because the Internet made a big fuss about the live broadcast , Anran\u2019s PR team reacted very quickly to do damage control. They not only forced the live broadcast app admins to shut down the live broadcast, but also issued a statement immediately.Anran himself issued a statement that afternoon. This was the first time that he began to mention the Zhang family in front of the public. The Weibo he posted was also full of bitterness and hardship. The general content can be briefly summarized as follows:[I didn\u2019t want to announce these to the public, because this is a scar I don\u2019t want to open up.][I was very sad when I learned the truth about being abducted and switched at birth. I have been treating them as my biological parents for so many years, but I didn\u2019t expect them to not be my real parents. On top of that, they weren\u2019t being honest with me. They kept me in the dark for so many years, and without any remorse.][My bad attitude towards her that day was also because I couldn\u2019t control my emotions. I\u2019m sorry for my bad behavior, and I don\u2019t ask for your forgiveness. I just want to say the truth for all of you.]The entire Weibo post was full of eloquent, pre-written words. He composed a heartwrenching essay, telling the heartache of a kidnapped child.Immediately, some fans stood up and felt distressed:[Ranran, we understand you.][I didn\u2019t expect you to be so miserable.][The Zhang couple are so heartless!]But the majority of the netizens were rational people with a working brain. They have been blinded once by Anran, so they were more skeptical towards him. Furthermore, they also seen Anran\u2019s duality in the live broadcast room, so they felt that this \u201cpitiful\u201d look was just a well-crafted persona.[I remember that he was on the show before, he thanked his mother for saving money for buying him musical instruments and paying for his dance classes. So you\u2019re saying that thankfulness was faked?][Oh, now suddenly, your ex-parents are horrible people!][Wait, didn\u2019t you already know that the Zhang couple aren\u2019t your biological parents during \u201cStarlight\u201d?][Hahaha, do you still have two faces here?]Especially the fans of Jian Xingsui, naturally they wouldn\u2019t let this opportunity go. They still vividly remember that slander campaign Anran held against their baby. Now, it\u2019s the high time to give everyone a reminder, so Anran couldn\u2019t escape the consequences of his actions.[You said Suisui bullied you in high school, but you clearly admitted that you\u2019re lying about that!][You want to apologize to everyone? How about apologize to Suisui first! You clearly slandered him!][The party who was wronged the most in this situation still ended up being Suisui. Go apologize to him already, you two-faced bitch!][Don\u2019t worry about it, you aren\u2019t the only suffering party here. Suisui is, and he\u2019s a way better person than you are.]If it were before, when Anran\u2019s pitiful quotes came out, the majority of people would feel sorry for him. But after the live broadcast incident, with the exception of his loyal fans, netizens began to wake up and see his true face. Anran\u2019s Weibo was a mess, and his painstakingly designed fairy-boy persona also collapsed.But Mrs. Zhang in the court didn\u2019t know that Anran had already cut-off their relationship in order to whitewash his image. She was still insisting, \u201cIs he not here? Is he really not here? I\u2019m his mother, I I have raised him for more than 20 years! Is he not willing to come for my last visit?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded and looked at the woman in front of him indifferently. Almost mercilessly, he repeated, \u201cHe didn\u2019t come.\u201dMrs. Zhang was stunned, stood there limply for a while, and suddenly laughed out loud. It\u2019s as if she was laughing at herself in irony. Her laughter became louder, crazier, and more unhinged. Finally, the uncontrolled laughter metamorphosed into a racking sobs. Tears spilled out from her eyes, wetting her cheeks.\u201cI know, he won\u2019t come.\u201d\u201cActually, from the moment he knew the truth, he hated me. I know this. I know\u2026 this\u2026\u201d Mrs. Zhang seemed to be muttering to herself.She once refused to accept the news of her child\u2019s death. She was confused, so she did a lot of wrong things. She had switched another child to become her own, so it\u2019s as if her child never died in the first place.She was wrong. She was a sinner. No matter her reason, she was still a thief, and she must face her current ending.People from the court followed behind, trying to drag Mrs. Zhang away.But Mrs. Zhang seemed to have an unexplainable strength. She wanted to pull Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand again, and with a last-ditch effor, she asked: \u201cSuisui, can you forgive me? Will you forgive me?\u201dJian Xingsui looked at her without saying a word.However, Mrs. Zhang seemed to be more emotional, and she burst into tears. During this period of time, she has aged a lot, and it seems that a lot of gray hair has grown on her head overnight. Her hand was still holding Jian Xingsui with a death grip, even her fingers were a little white. Amidst her cries, she asked: \u201cSuisui, please answer me, will you forgive me?\u201dShe was getting more unhinged. Jian Xingsui steeled his heart, and managed to shake her grip. With a whisper, he answered: \u201cNo.\u201dMrs. Zhang\u2019s face immediately turned pale.Even when the judge sentenced her for a life imprisonment, her face was never so sad and pale.The light of hope disappeared from Zhang Xia\u2019s eyes little by little. Jian Xingsui\u2019s words were like a heavy hammer, breaking the last line of her psychological defense.\u201cDo you think you can be forgiven if you go to jail and get punished?\u201d Jian Xingsui looked at her with dark eyes. Although his voice was as unemotional as it can be, every word seemed to pierce her in her heart, \u201cYou lost your child and you feel heartbroken. So you understand that feeling, right? Have you ever thought about my Mother? What about her feelings, when she found out that her child died? Shouldn\u2019t you be able to empathize with her? Do you think you can pay your sins clean by going to jail? No. Never. I won\u2019t forgive you. Not even on my deathbed.\u201dJian Xingsui knew that Zhang Xia would never know the depth of the tragedy she had caused in her grief.He could never tell her that in his last life, he died at the age of 23 years old. And because of her selfishness, he died in an unknown alley, and no one cared about him.His mother never knew the truth. She never knew that her baby survived, just to die a dog\u2019s death in an alley somewhere, probably even without a proper grave.\u201cI hate you.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s eyes clearly reflected Zhang Xia\u2019s figure. For a moment, her vision blurred, as if she was returned to that day in her house\u2019s courtyard. Anran stood in front of her and said the same words. The two figures overlapped and separated in an instant, but what remained unchanged was the pair of eyes full of resentment and disgust towards her.Jian Xingsui said in a deep voice, giving her his final ultimatum, \u201cI will never forgive you.\u201dWith that, her last bit of strength was gone. Her body softened, and she slumped down unceremoniously on the ground. Fortunately, the people behind her quickly helped her up. The scene was a bit chaotic, but fortunately there were staff to maintain order. In the end, she was still taken into custody.Jian Xingsui came with the members of the Shen family, and he had to leave after the court.Xu Enzhen came from behind and looked at him worriedly, \u201cSuisui, are you okay?\u201dJian Xingsui shook his head and restrained his resentment. He smiled at his mother, knowing that the older woman was very worried about him. With every ounce of gentleness he had, he lied, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dShen Xingchen has long been tired of watching them. Naturally, he complained with a loud voice, \u201cIt\u2019s finally over! God, I despise that woman so much!\u201dIn the end, the case closed. Some parts weren\u2019t made public in order to protect the Shen family\u2019s privacy. The court has not disclosed to the public who Jian Xingsui\u2019s real parents are.Shen Yong also came today. The case might be over, but he still had something to deal with, \u201cSuisui, I discussed with your mother. Since the case is over, your household registration should also be transferred. Let\u2019s finish it within two days.\u201dJian Xingsui had no objection, nodded on the spot and said, \u201cMhmm, let\u2019s do it.\u201dAfter they settled the matter, everyone was very happy and relieved.Just as everyone was walking outside, Jian Xingsui\u2019s cell phone rang. He picked it up and saw that it was the call from his agent. After answering the call, he heard the middle-aged man\u2019s voice: \u201cHello Suisui, I saw that your case is over. I want to ask, which family are your biological parents? Have you found them yet?\u201dWang-ge\u2018s attitude was very casual.Because he felt that with that Zhang Xia\u2019s ability, she could switch a child from the wealthy Jian family. But she couldn\u2019t do that twice, couldn\u2019t she?So, Jian Xingsui\u2019s biological family must\u2019ve been an ordinary family at best.Since his background was basically non-existent, what is there to be afraid of? He could just handle Jian Xingsui as he wanted.Jian Xingsui said softly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAh, there\u2019s nothing wrong.\u201d Wang-ge was impatient for a long time, mainly because he was also impatiently being urged by the company\u2019s upper management. He couldn\u2019t wait to turn Jian Xingsui into his personal cash cow, \u201cSince if you\u2019re done with this matter, it\u2019s time to go back to the company to take a gig. Have you figured it out after I\u2019ve given you such a long vacation?\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s eyes were cold, \u201cYes, I\u2019ve figured it out. I want to terminate my contract.\u201dHis agent was short of breath. With visible anger, he threatened the youth, \u201cI suggest you think about it carefully. Do you even have the money to pay for the liquidated damages? It will cost several million.\u00a0 Don\u2019t slap your face and pretend to be a wealthy man. Know your worth. If you terminate your contract with us, where else can you go? Is there any good company that can help you?\u201dAs for Zhang Xiangyang\u2019s ending, the author really didn\u2019t specify it. But seeing the previous chapters, it\u2019s highly implied that he will die soon.1tbh, the author was switching between 20 and 21, so I chose 20 because JXS\u2019 latest birthday (from what I remembered) was his 20th.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stopped, turned around, and asked curiously: \u201cSuisui, why don\u2019t you walk? Is something the matter?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dWhen they asked, Jian Xingsui subconsciously wanted to bear the burden by himself. He almost lied to them that \u201cthere\u2019s no trouble\u201d in pure reflex. He was so used to dealing with everything by himself, because he had no one to rely on for many years.But this time, when everyone looked at him with worried eyes, Jian Xingsui\u2019s heart tightened first, and then he relaxed again. He sighed softly, adjusted his mood before speaking, \u201d Well, my\u2026 previous brokerage company is making a little trouble for me. So I need to deal with it.\u201dShen Xingchen was annoyed, \u201cWhat, that thing called Bankrupt Entertainment?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dShen Xingchen was curious: \u201cThat company has gone bankrupt?\u201dJian Xingsui shook his head this time, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that type of problem. I.. have an ongoing dispute with them. You see, when I was filming \u2018Starlight\u2019\u201dAs they reached their car, he gave his family a brief explanation of what had happened, especially the bits about \u201cbeing forced into retirement mid-way through because of a million yuan deal he didn\u2019t agree\u201d. He only mentioned about being threatened by his agent, because he really didn\u2019t want to speak too much about his previous misery.\u2013Because he didn\u2019t want his cherished family to be sad because of him.But what Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t know was that when he understated his suffering, it made people feel even more distressed.Xu Enzhen\u2019s eyes were red again. She held Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand, trembling, and said angrily, \u201cIt\u2019s too much, it\u2019s too much, how can they bully you like this! These people are really lawless, thinking that they can cover the sky with their hands1an idiom. It means being unscrupulous with any consequences, because they can cover it up with the money/power they have.!\u201dShen Xingchen was originally an upright young man, so he slapped his seat\u2019s handrest after hearing it, \u201cSo that\u2019s the case! Isn\u2019t this shitty-ass company itching to get bankrupt? They dared to bully my didi, huh. They sure have guts. Tell me, what didn\u2019t you tell me that time? Are you such a helpless idiot?\u201dJian Xingsui could only smile in hopes to lessen his second brother\u2019s temper, \u201cI will just cause you trouble if I tell you.\u201dShen Xingchen choked.Shen Minglang was more sensible, and he could understand the actual situation even with such limited information. He glanced at Shen Xingchen, and spoke for Jian Xingsui, \u201cSeeing the situation of that time, that company must have finished the contract negotiation, and there was nothing Suisui could say in that contract. Basically, it\u2019s useless even if he told you. On the contrary, with your brain, maybe you will only make things worse.\u201dShen Xingchen said angrily, \u201cGe, you are too contemptuous! What can\u2019t I solve?\u201dShen Minglang asked back, \u201cThen, do you know the most effective method to minimize Suisui\u2019s loss? It\u2019s not contract termination. Instead, we should make Bankrupt Entertainment really bankrupt. Do you know how to do that?\u201dOnce again, Shen Xingchen choked by his older brother\u2019s audacious declaration. He was speechless. He did say about making that company bankrupt, but he really didn\u2019t have a clue on how to do it.Shen Minglang turned around to face his youngest brother, pushed his glasses. Despite him looking calm, he was still desperately trying to increase his favorability with his lovely youngest brother. He used every bit of his dignity to appear reliable, and told Jian Xingsui, \u201cCall me if you face troubles in the future.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t expect that. But he quickly recovered, and with a light and crisp voice, subconsciously answered, \u201cThank you, dage.\u201dShen Minglang\u2019s mouth curled into a smile.In fact, he had always had an untold wish since childhood; that was, he wanted a well-behaved and obedient younger brother, preferably the soft and cute type he could spoil to his heart\u2019s content. As a result, life didn\u2019t give him what he wanted, and he was saddled with a bear child like Shen Xingchen. He loved Shen Xingchen, truly, but because of his brash and willful personality, it\u2019s hard for Shen Minglang to spoil him silly without a serious repercussion.He was already resigned to his fate, but it seemed that God actually favored him. Jian Xingsui, his ideal type of a younger brother, actually appeared. And thus, he would spoil Jian Xingsui to offset his previous\u2019 life grievances.Besides Shen Minglang, there was another person in the family who had a very similar temperament and wish \u2013 the patriarch, Shen Yong.Shen Yong, who was currently behind the wheel, said, \u201cMinglang, although you know more than Xingchen, you are not involved with the entertainment industry after all. I think it\u2019s better to ask Mr. Fu\u2019s parents to handle this matter, or at least let Fu Jinxiao do it. They are already experts in this field, so they should be able to handle this well.\u201dThe Fu family?Jian Xingsui was taken aback when he heard this, and had a vague guess in his heart.Shen Minglang didn\u2019t object. Of course he also knew that Fu Jinxiao\u2019s ability in this field surpassed his. He pushed his glasses once again, and agreed, \u201cYes, I have always been on good terms with Jinxiao. I will call him later to communicate this with him. Hopefully, he\u2019ll be willing to help. With his help, this will be very easy to handle.\u201dJian Xingsui hesitated and said, \u201cThe person you\u2019re talking about is\u2026 Actor Fu?\u201dShen Minglang nodded, \u201cYes, your instructor in that show.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know why, but when he heard his eldest brother say \u201cyour instructor\u201d, his earlobes automatically reddened. He lowered his head shyly, thinking that it\u2019s been a long time since he heard of Fu Jinxiao. He almost thought that he would never meet his idol again in this life.Shen Yong thought he was still worried.\u201cYou can rest assured about this matter. It doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t terminate the contract peacefully. It\u2019s just a small company. If it becomes a big deal, I can just buy it.\u201d Shen Yong spoke while driving. His imposing voice made him akin to an immovable mountain, \u201cOur family is strong. We won\u2019t let our child be hurt by anyone.\u201dHis statement was loud and clear. He didn\u2019t seem to be angry, just stating the facts.But it made Jian Xingsui\u2019s heart full with feelings of being protected. He was now secure and safe. It also aroused little ripples in his heart.From childhood to adulthood, during his stay with the Jian family; everytime he made a mistake, his father and brothers would always only blame him for embarrassing the Jian family again. Even if he was bullied, they would use the rhetoric of \u201chow could someone bully you?\u201d or with an implied meaning that he\u2019s the bully instead.This was the first time he felt such protection, and they were on his side without any question.Jian Xingsui was a little moved, looked at the man sitting in the front, and said softly, \u201cThank you Dad, I know.\u201dShen Yong\u2019s body froze inaudibly, and the all-powerful Mr. Shen replied softly, as if he was afraid of frightening the child, \u201cNo need to say thank you in the future, you are my son, and we are all part of the same family.\u201dJian Xingsui gave a small nod.While the Shen patriarch appeared calm on the surface, his heart is also blooming. Yes, just like his eldest son, he has always been looking forward to having a caring and soft child.It\u2019s a pity that his eldest son was indifferent by nature, and he cared more about profit even compared to himself. He did excel in business, so at least Shen Yong was glad he would have a great successor to his business empire.Needless to say, his second son couldn\u2019t be described with the words \u201cobedient\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d.A child of Jian Xingsui\u2019s type deeply poked Shen Yong\u2019s heart. But, as a president famous for his facial paralysis, he wasn\u2019t very good at expressing his emotions. Even when his heart was on the verge of excessive ecstasy with that call of \u201cDad\u201d, he still looked reserved.Xu Enzhen took Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand, \u201cSuisui, have they been contacting you and threatening you since the end of the show?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded as he replied, \u201cI have been contacted once or twice.\u201dHearing this, Xu Enzhen was still sad, although it\u2019s clear she was becoming more and more murderous, \u201cJust because of that one million? Their greediness is astounding!\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t want to see her mother sad, so he immediately inched closer to comfort her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay Mom, it\u2019s over.\u201dWith this, Xu Enzhen had an epiphany about his youngest son\u2019s financial condition. It must be because he had no money that he suffered this kind of humiliation by such a trash agency.She must rectify this immediately. \u201cSuisui, you send your card number to Mom.\u201dJian Xingsui was confused, \u201cUhm\u2026 why?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a formal job yet, so Mom will transfer some pocket money for you,\u201d Xu Enzhen seemed to be worried that Jian Xingsui wouldn\u2019t take it, so she added: \u201cYour Erge and Dage also got it.\u201dJian Xingsui originally wanted to refuse. But he agreed once he heard the latter sentence.Shen Xingchen patted him on the shoulder and said, \u201cYou can send it to me too.\u201dShen Yong added, \u201cNow that you mention it. Xingchen, make a groupchat and bring your didi in.\u201dThey were all busy people, and had difficulty seeing each other on weekdays. Normally, they would communicate via their phones or through Auntie Wu. Since Jian Xingsui finally returned, it\u2019s only right to make a new groupchat with him included.Shen Xingchen happily agreed, \u201cOkay!\u201dHe quickly created a group, the name of the group was:Shen Minglang complained with an expressionless face, \u201cWhat a cheesy name.\u201dShen Xingchen yelled, as it felt like his older brother was insulting his sense of aesthetic, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this? \u201cShen Minglang ignored him, and changed the group name into:Xu Enzhen told her husband about the new name, to which he frowned and criticized, \u201cToo official.\u201dThis eldest son was good at everything, but he was too formal and self-interested.Xu Enzhen thought about it as she played with her mobile phone. Then, with a mysterious smile, she changed it again into:After everyone saw this name, no one raised any objections.Shen Xingchen said, \u201cIt\u2019s quite literary and artistic. It\u2019s very nice.\u201dShen Minglang also nodded, as he felt that using a character from Jian Xingsui\u2019s name was the best choice, \u201cNot bad.\u201dJian Xingsui was a little shy when he saw it, and he said softly: \u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2026 a bit\u2026\u201d\u201cVery good.\u201d Shen Yong also agreed very much. He glanced at his wife, their relationship was already very good, but seeing this made him fall in love even deeper than before.\u00a0 \u201cAs expected of you. You\u2019re really good at this.\u201dXu Enzhen pursed her lips and smiled triumphantly, \u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201dThey all reminded Jian Xingsui about sending his card number to the group. Not long after, they reached home.Shen Yong and Shen Minglang had to go back to work, so they went to the company together. Xu Enzhen was going to the kitchen to cook, saying that a guest would be visiting in the evening, so she had to cook a good meal. As for Shen Xingchen, he was going back to his room to catch up on sleep.\u00a0 Jian Xingsui decided to go back to his room to take a shower.However, just as he was taking off his clothes, his phone vibrated and a text message appeared:[500,000 yuan was transferred to your card ending with -2436. Remaining balance: 500,100 yuan. Transferred from: Shen Xingchen.]Jian Xingsui: \u201c?\u201dWhy did the pocket money come from his second older brother?And did he even need this much pocket money for a month? Did he accidentally put a few extra zeros?Jian Xingsui held his mobile phone in doubt for a long time, but his clothes had already been taken off, so he couldn\u2019t go to Shen Xingchen\u2019s room to ask. In the end, he decided to finish showering first before asking him about this.Unexpectedly, just after putting down the phone and walking a few steps, he received another text message:[1,000,000 yuan was transferred to your card ending with -2436. Remaining balance: 1,500,100 yuan. Transferred from: Xu Enzhen.]Then, another messages appeared one after another:[1,000,000 yuan was transferred to your card ending with -2436. Remaining balance: 2,500,100 yuan. Transferred from: Shen Minglang.][5,000,000 yuan was transferred to your card ending with -2436. Remaining balance: 7,500,10037,5 mil yuan is approx 1,1 mil USD. Yes, I do get a mini heart attack when converting the amount. yuan. Transferred from: Shen Yong.]Jian Xingsui stood far away in a daze holding his phone, looking at the numbers on the screen in front of him. He even felt that he couldn\u2019t count the dizzying amount of zeros in front of his eyes.They call this\u2026 pocket money???Meanwhile, with Shen Minglang and Shen Yong.The father-son duo was sitting side-by-side, a palpable spark of tension appeared between them.They both were looking down at their own mobile phones, and they both put it away after finishing the money transfer.Shen Yong said casually, \u201cYou transferred pocket money for Suisui?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Shen Minglang nodded, \u201cJust a little.\u201dShen Yong nodded, \u201cI also transferred a little.\u201dThe two looked at each other, they both saw a little distrust in each other\u2019s eyes. They both shared the same thoughts \u2013 the other party was trying to please Suisui behind their backs.Shen Minglang stood still and tried to fish the amount his father transferred, \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s the monthly pocket money, and he just came back. I didn\u2019t want to scare him, so I didn\u2019t give him too much, just enough for him to play around.\u201dShen Yong crossed his legs, looking as steady as a mountain, and said in a low voice, \u201cWell, I just expressed my heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe car fell into silence again.Both of them had their own calculations in their hearts, and no one believed the other\u2019s nonsense.Uh\u2026 just a quick spoiler about JXS, in case you\u2019re wondering:Yes, JXS\u2019 name will be changed into Shen Xingsui in the future.1an idiom. It means being unscrupulous with any consequences, because they can cover it up with the money/power they have.2Both the \u201cXing\u201d in Xingchen\u2019s and Xingsui\u2019s name means \u201cStar\u201d. Minglang\u2019s name means \u201cclear/bright/forthright\u201d but the hanzi for Ming [\u660e] is made from a combination of the hanzi for Sun [\u65e5] and Moon [\u6708].

The other party claimed that she was Fu Jinxiao\u2019s agent. Now that the car had arrived at the Shen family\u2019s house, she said she wanted to have a private chat with Jian Xingsui about the contract.Jian Xingsui was still shocked when he received the call: \u201cYou are Ms. Wang?\u201dWang Meican smiled: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, is it surprising?\u201d\u201cI just didn\u2019t expect it.\u201d As he ran downstairs to meet the older lady, Jian Xingsui said in a respectful manner, \u201cI have heard about your name in the industry for a long time. You are a well-known gold medal agent. I didn\u2019t expect to see you today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also an honor to meet you. Come down quickly, I\u2019ll wait for you outside.\u201dJian Xingsui answered, \u201cOkay.\u201dWang Meican felt a little emotional after hanging up the phone.In fact, logically speaking, it\u2019s just a matter of terminating the contract. She shouldn\u2019t have to do it herself, she could delegate it to someone else. Even if the call was made at Fu Jinxiao\u2019s request, Wang Meican could definitely arrange for someone capable to do it. However, she had to do it in person, as this matter was so miraculous \u2013 that Fu Jinxiao, who has always been indifferent to anything, gave an order on behalf of another person.Wang Meican was a little surprised at that time, mostly because Fu Jinxiao just got off the plane in the morning and was supposed to be resting. He heard her saying that he was going to pick up Jian Xingsui, and actually followed her. It was like he was afraid that someone would bully Jian Xingsui.Jian Xingsui trotted downstairs, opened the car door and was about to say hello to Wang Meican, but when he looked up, he met another handsome face.Fu Jinxiao was leaning lazily on the back seat of the nanny van. He was still wearing a black suit that should be worn for attending events, looking like a refined nobleman. At this moment, his handsome face was curled into a careless smile, \u201d Oh, what a coincidence.\u201dJian Xingsui stood up in shock. He was used to being a trainee, and when he saw an instructor, he subconsciously straightened his back . Was it because he was too nervous, or because he forgot where he was? Thanks to that, his head almost hit the roof of the car.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows slightly in surprise.Jian Xingsui was a little annoyed. He steadied himself, sat up, closed the car door, and said respectfully: \u201cMr. Fu, long time no see.\u201dFu Jinxiao felt a little happy when he saw this naive kid, and answered in an ambiguous tone, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, but I\u2019ve already left \u2018Starlight\u2019, so you don\u2019t need to call me instructor anymore.\u201dJian Xingsui: \u201cWell, since you taught me, even if I leave \u201cStarlight\u201d, I will never forget your kindness. So I\u2019ll continue to consider you as a teacher-figure of sorts.\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows: \u201cReally?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded seriously: \u201cReally!\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Fu Jinxiao elongated the ending sound, and his slow voice was slightly teasing, \u201cI honestly couldn\u2019t see your action that supported this statement. You didn\u2019t message me for over two months. You didn\u2019t give me an update of your life. Is this just another of your sweet-talk?\u201dJian Xingsui was shocked. He was afraid that Fu Jinxiao would misunderstand, so he hurriedly explained: \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just afraid to disturb you!\u201dFu Jinxiao looked at the anxious youth. He had red lips and white teeth, and his hair had really grown a lot. He looked delicate and beautiful. Now his cheeks were a little red because of his eagerness. He was cute and easy to bully, which really tempted him to tease him even further.Wang Meican, who was watching on the sidelines: \u201c\u2026\u201dCan her artist be a human?Was it so fun to play with a junior? Why didn\u2019t she find out about this quirk before?Wang Meican coughed lightly, trying to ease the atmosphere.Fu Jinxiao received her signal. He raised his eyebrows, and finally restrained his teasing, his voice was low and magnetic, \u201cI\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m just teasing you.\u201dJian Xingsui breathed a sigh of relief.Fu Jinxiao saw that Jian Xingsui was not as nervous as he just saw him, and his expression became much more serious. When he became serious, his temperament was completely different from before. The actor decided to directly cut to the main topic, \u201cHave you brought the contract?\u201dJian Xingsui was startled, and hurriedly nodded. He took out the things in his arms, \u201cI brought it.\u201dWang Meican took it immediately and glanced at it. As a professional agent, she saw the problem at a glance, \u201cThis contract seems to be fine, but there are many hidden traps. If you are young and inexperienced, you can easily be tricked. You didn\u2019t think so much at that time?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded.Wang Meican subconsciously glanced at Fu Jinxiao, wanting to know what the actor wanted for her to do. But the Film King didn\u2019t answer, just sat there, flipping through the itinerary for the next few days in boredom, with a calm expression and no thoughts.This also made the agent a little discouraged.In fact, after working together for so many years, she still can\u2019t see through Fu Jinxiao. His emotions were all over the place, while his thoughts ran deep; both which made it difficult for her to parse through. However, she used to be proud of his traits. After all, artists like him were resistant to the media\u2019s ploy. But now she felt a little annoyed \u2013 after all these years, Fu Jinxiao was still a mystery even to her.Wang Meican continued to tentatively say to Jian Xingsui, \u201cThen we are terminating the contract early, which is equivalent to a breach of contract, so if we talk about liquidated damages at that time\u2026\u201dBefore Jian Xingsui could speak, Fu Jinxiao, who was next to him, closed his schedule, \u201d Liquidated damages?\u201dWang Meican looked at him suspiciously.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s slender legs crossed, and a smile appeared on his gentle and refined face, \u201cIs there a need to negotiate liquidated damages for terminating a contract with a small company like Bankrupt Entertainment?\u201dWang Meican had a guess in her heart of what Fu Jinxiao implied, but she still hesitated. So, she asked for a clarification, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what kind of virtue this entertainment company has always relied on?\u201dIn fact, this was an easy guess. This kind of unscrupulous agency most likely relied on the wine and sex business1he was talking about prostitution and unspoken rules. \u2013 they would pull their artist in this kind of \u201cparty\u201d, or made money by taking the liquidated damages from some young artists. All kinds of shady activities have been done by them.Wang Meican said, a little disbelief appeared in her eyes, \u201cThen you are going to\u2026\u201d\u201cTo deal with a bandit, you must use a bandit\u2019s methods,\u201d Fu Jinxiao sat gracefully, looking very reasonable, and he glanced at Jian Xingsui, \u201cThat agent and the upper management of that agency bullies you a lot, right?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded slowly, still digesting what Fu Jinxiao implied.The car just arrived downstairs of the agency building. Fu Jinxiao pushed open the door and walked out. The tall and handsome man leaned against the car door and glanced inside. His face has a bit of rogue-ish charm to it, which was different from his usual appearance. He said slowly, a ruffian grin slowly forming on his face, \u201cThis teacher of yours wouldn\u2019t just yell for nothing. Let\u2019s go, we\u2019ll meet them and give them a taste of their own medicine.\u201dML: I can finally return! Out with familial drama, it\u2019s time for romance!1he was talking about prostitution and unspoken rules.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

See you tomorrow~The white light in the parking lot fell on the person. Jian Xingsui sat in the car and looked up. The man standing outside was tall and handsome. Even his cynical expression was also very handsome. At this moment, he could only feel his heart start erratically beating out of control.For a moment, he remembered that \u201cStarlight\u201d battle royale, this man also said the same thing that time.Fu Jinxiao stood in front of him when he needed help. Although the actor never made too many promises, as long as he was there, he would never let Jian Xingsui be exposed to wind and rain.Sure enough, no matter how many times they meet again, Jian Xingsui would fall in love with him. It was meant to be, wasn\u2019t it? All butterflies chased after honey, and he chased after his idol.Jian Xingsui came back to his senses, and after getting off the car, he picked up his mobile phone and called his agent, \u201cHey, Wang-ge, didn\u2019t you ask me come over? I\u2019m downstairs now, and um\u2026 I also brought the contract. Come on, I brought my friends here this time, just to discuss the termination of the contract with you.\u201dThe middle-aged man\u00a0 was shocked, and almost suspected that he heard it wrong, \u201cDo you really want to terminate the contract with us?\u201dJian Xingsui answered immediately, \u201cYup.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 well, don\u2019t regret it!\u201d This agent was not very afraid, even if Jian Xingsui brought friends over, so what? Could he invite someone actually useful? With his no-name background, it\u2019s practically impossible. The agent dared him, \u201cOkay, then you come up!\u201dJian Xingsui just hung up the phone and followed Fu Jinxiao and Wang Meican up.There was an elevator dedicated to employees, so the journey was unimpeded. When they arrived at the meeting room on the 10th floor, his agent was still speaking with other executives. There was an inconspicuous tea stain on his clothes.Wang Meican pushed open the door and said to the people inside, \u201cSorry to bother you.\u201dFu Jinxiao, who walked in slowly from behind, glanced at the people in the room, saw the teapot on the table and smiled slightly, \u201cGood afternoon, everyone.\u201d\u201cClatter\u201dAlmost all the people in the room stood up after the voice fell.Everyone was shocked. Everyone in the entertainment circle knew who Fu Jinxiao was, and they also knew the agency backing him up \u2013 Fenghua Entertainment, and specifically, the Fu Conglomerate backing them up. Standing there, it was almost like facing the King of Heaven.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, everyone please sit down.\u201d Fu Jinxiao raised his hand casually, and he pulled a chair to sit down. He was courteous from beginning to end, but his aura of calmness made everyone nervous. A shallow smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, as if was just making casual talks,\u201dI came this time for Jian Xingsui\u2019s contract termination. I heard that your company wants to talk about it. I\u2019m here to help my junior because someone entrusted me to do it, so I brought my agent to listen to everyone\u2019s opinions.\u2018Someone entrusted\u2019 you?Who on earth could do it?This sentence came to everyone\u2019s minds at the same time, while Fu Jinxiao ignored their bewildered expression as he continued to speak, \u201cOf course, everyone here is a reasonable person. This time, we will follow the original contract. My agent is mainly responsible for the negotiation. And I\u2019m just here to listen, everyone can just pretend that I don\u2019t exist.\u201d \u201c\u201c\u2026\u201dWho dared to pretend that you don\u2019t exist?!Despite being in Winter, the backs of all the executives were sweating. Even if Fu Jinxiao sat there without speaking, he was as dreadful and impossible to ignore as a plague god.Agent Wang lost his previous arrogance and looked at Jian Xingsui, \u201cSuisui, this is your friend you said you\u2019re bringing?\u201dJian Xingsui nodded slightly, pretending to be unbothered.The middle-aged agent stuttered a bit when he spoke, and smiled awkwardly, \u201cYou have a good eye, and you are getting better at meeting people and making friends.\u201dJian Xingsui hadn\u2019t spoken yet, but Fu Jinxiao who was next to him said slowly, \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true.\u201dAgent Wang looked at him.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s smile contained sarcasm, \u201cOtherwise, how could he sign a contract with your company?\u201dThe agent was very arrogant when he faced Jian Xingsui, but he was obsequious when facing Fu Jinxiao. Even if he was ridiculed, he could still keep a smile on his face, \u201cYes, yes, yes\u2026\u201dWang Meican didn\u2019t want to talk nonsense with them, so she urged, \u201cLet\u2019s start, we are here to discuss the termination of the contract with your company this time. In other words, we propose to terminate the contract today and demand compensation from your company for: (1) the artist\u2019s mental damage fee, (2) compensation for the time and energy wasted in your company in the past two years. Oh, I also learned that you did not notify his work ahead of time, and you did not give him appropriate resources for the past two years, leading him to have to search for his own work by himself. All compensation must be paid at the same time, and the total amount is about five million yuan.\u201dEveryone at the table was shocked!They were gathered here today because they all wanted to educate Jian Xingsui and extort a termination fee along the way. But who knows, they were extorted instead!Agent Wang was shocked by this turn of event,\u201dWell, Ms. Wang, why do we have to pay these expenses? Logically speaking, it should be Suisui who breached the contract first?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think this artist initiated to terminate his contract in advance?\u201d Wang Meican\u2019s tone implied something. She gave out an innocent-looking smile as she pulled out a recorder. Looking at the device, Agent Wang immediately thought it was a recording of that time he threatened Jian Xingsui for that illegal one million yuan deal. His face immediately paled at an astounding speed.Wang Meican continued to smile, as if she was already winning this case, \u201cThis is the recording of that corridor I got from the \u2018Starlight\u2019 director team. As a brokerage company, you did not protect the rights and interests of your artists. And even adopting a threatening method has seriously damaged the artist\u2019s physical and mental health.\u201dAgent Wang\u2019s face turned pale. He never thought that Wang Meican would be so powerful!Jian Xingsui also looked at Wang Meican in shock.Wang Meican herself seemed calm. But in fact, only she knew that there was nothing in the recorder. These were the tricks Fu Jinxiao taught her to bluff people on the way here. In terms of insidiousness and cunning, nobody could top Actor Fu. That man was on another level, and she has learned from seeing him.Naturally, Agent Wang was frightened, and he stammered, \u201cY-you\u2026 this is an internal affairs of our c-company. Be-besides\u2026 besides, the original contract didn\u2019t\u2026 mention anything about his mental wellbeing. Jian Xingsui still is the voluntary party who initiated the termination of the contract, which means he breached the contract!\u201d\u201cInternal affairs?\u201d Fu Jinxiao finally spoke. He sat there lazily and curled his lips, \u201cI remember that Li Xu\u2019an is also from your company. So his private drinking with \u2018patrons\u2019 and taking care of his own \u2018girls\u2019 could be counted as an internal affair too1yes FJX implies LXA have BOTH sugar mommies and sugar babies. Amazing.?\u201dAgent Wang\u2019s face turned even paler.Li Xu\u2019an was the hottest artist in their agency. He could be counted as the agency\u2019s cash cow and their thickest pillar. If he was over, then the Bankrupt Entertainment would also be over.Another person came in from outside the glass door, and it was Ji Chuan, the president of Bankrupt Entertainment. He had an ominous premonition the moment he heard that Fu Jinxiao had come to the company, and now he hurried in, running until he panted.Fu Jinxiao turned around and saw him, smiling: \u201cOh, maybe the fact that President Ji took care of an outside mistress is also an internal affair.\u201dMr. Ji\u2019s face also turned pale in an instant, and he almost couldn\u2019t hold the door open.Nobody in this room could hold their original arrogant appearance. Even President Ji hurriedly came over with a smile and said in a panic, \u201cFu-ge, what\u2019s wrong with you? You didn\u2019t even tell me when you came. Are you here to help Xingsui to terminate his contract?\u201dFu Jinxiao didn\u2019t directly answered his question, \u201cWell, but I heard from the people under Mr. Ji that there seems to be some liquidated damages to be paid?\u201dJi Chuan kicked Agent Wang in the shin,\u201dWhat do you mean? What liquidated damages? Normal termination of the contract doesn\u2019t involve any liquidated damages!\u201dThe middle-aged agent got kicked and let out a cry of pain. He then endured the pain to respond, \u201cNo, yes, I just remembered, this is a normal termination of the contract. Suisui did not violate any term, and the termination contract can be signed in a while.\u201dFu Jinxiao glanced deeply at Agent Wang with his dark eyes, and lowered his tone until it sounded downright dangerous, \u201cNormal?\u201dHis voice had an implied promise of pain, and it made people\u2019s hearts tremble.Wang Meican said next to him, still that wide smile of hers, \u201cDid your company forget what I just said?\u201dAgent Wang felt like crying, and timidly glanced at his boss, \u201cLi-liquidated damages\u2026 y-you mean\u2026 that five million yuan you mentioned\u2026?\u201dJi Chuan felt the same. He wanted to burst into tears, but he couldn\u2019t. He just used his normal operations to extort money from his small-time artist, but he didn\u2019t expect to kick an iron plate2provoking someone you shouldn\u2019t provoke. today. Looking at Fu Jinxiao in front of him, he knew that if he didn\u2019t go along with what the actor demands, there would be even more painful retaliation next time. With a twitchy, forced smile, he replied, \u201cOf course, we broke the contract. Once the contract is signed, we will send the money to Suisui.\u201dFu Jinxiao smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s troubling you.\u201dPresident Ji nodded with tears in his eyes, \u201cNo trouble, no trouble, this is how it should be.\u201dFu Jinxiao looked down at Jian Xingsui again, while talking to the president, \u201cSince Mr. Ji also thinks it should be that way, shouldn\u2019t he apologize like an artist if they break the contract?\u201dPresident Ji was already very aggrieved in his heart; how can the boss apologize3this mentality is why you\u2019re a shitty boss. to his employee?If he knew this would happen, he would just agree when Jian Xingsui mentioned he wanted to terminate his contract. He really lifted a rock only to drop it on his own foot. President Ji felt bitter, but he still didn\u2019t dare to resist. He turned around and shook hands with Jian Xingsui, saying with deep sorrow, \u201cSuisui, we are the ones who let you down and wronged you.\u201dJian Xingsui did not expect such a development. He stood up and nodded reluctantly: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dFu Jinxiao glanced at Agent Wang with an inscrutable expression.The agent immediately understood, so he came over quickly and shook Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand. In fact, he felt a little guilty for Jian Xingsui in his heart, and this apology could be regarded as having a shred of his true feelings in it, \u201cSuisui, it was me who was in the wrong before. You have terminated the contract, congratulations, I hope you can have a good home in the future\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui never thought that one day these two people would apologize to themselves in such a humble way, but still nodded and said: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, forget it.\u201dThe originally difficult thing was quickly finalized.Jian Xingsui felt like he was in a dream when he got the contract to be terminated. When he went downstairs, he was still muttering: \u201cIs this all right?\u201dFu Jinxiao glanced at him with the corner of his eyes, \u201cYou still want to go back and beat them up?\u201dJian Xingsui thought it was a joke, but who knew that Fu Jinxiao was not kidding with him. If the youth agreed, Fu Jinxiao would really do it in his own way.Jian Xingsui shook his head quickly, and he asked again, \u201cHow did you know about the gossip between Li Xu\u2019an and President Ji?\u201dWas this actor so free that he knew all kinds of hidden gossip like these?Fu Jinxiao leaned against the railing of the elevator, with a lazy posture, and drawled, \u201cI just guessed.\u201d\u201c????\u201d Jian Xingsui\u2019s eyes widened.Wang Meican smiled and explained, \u201cEveryone in the circle who is not clean basically plays like this, and it is easy to guess right.\u201dJian Xingsui felt as if he had opened the door to a new world, and asked again: \u201cThen, that recording\u2026?\u201dWang Meican casually shrugged, \u201cOf course it\u2019s also a bluff. How can there be such a clear recording in that kind of place? This is just a tactic to scare them. It\u2019s their own guilty conscience making it seem real. This is what your Teacher Fu taught me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe way Jian Xingsui looked at Fu Jinxiao has changed. Besides admiration and awe, he deeply felt that his previous knowledge of Fu Jinxiao was simply only the tip of an iceberg!Back in the car, Wang Meican tactfully did not want to be the light bulb4third-wheeling, \u201cThen I have to go back to the company, see you in two days.\u201dFu Jinxiao responded lightly, and said to Jian Xingsui: \u201cMy driver will pick us up. We\u2019ll go to the Shen family\u2019s house.\u201dJian Xingsui was taken aback, and asked in surprise, \u201cAre you going back to Shen family\u2019s house too?\u201d\u201cWhy, don\u2019t you know?\u201d Fu Jinxiao\u2019s handsome face had a hint of teasing, \u201cMrs. Xu invited my mother to be a guest today. We\u2019ll have dinner together.\u201dJian Xingsui remembered that Xu Enzhen seemed to have said so at noon, but he didn\u2019t expect the guest to be Fu Jinxiao and his mother.The youth shook his head obediently, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 are your Mother and mine close friends?\u201dFu Jinxiao treated him patiently, \u201cIt\u2019s not only close friends, they are childhood friends.\u201dHearing that, Jian Xingsui had a guess, \u201cSo Mom wants to introduce me to Auntie?The actor thought about it for a second, before nodding, \u201cWhile your guess isn\u2019t technically wrong, I guess it\u2019s more of\u2026 Mrs. Xu wants to introduce me to you.\u201dJian Xingsui: \u201c??\u201dWhat does this even mean?...well, uh, if you guys remember the previous chapters.It is said that the Shen and the Fu have some kind of marriage contract/agreement sooooIf you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1yes FJX implies LXA have BOTH sugar mommies and sugar babies.

He decided to roll with whatever would happen and mull over the termination of his contract instead. Suddenly, the car braked abruptly, which brought Jian Xingsui back to his senses and stabilized his mind.Fu Jinxiao, who was sitting next to him, glanced at him: \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201dJian Xingsui immediately turned around and saw Actor Fu looking at him, so he replied, \u201cI\u2019m thinking\u2026 about my previous agency.\u201d\u201cYour contract termination is a thing of the past.\u201d Fu Jinxiao sat beside him. The man had been looking at the scripts and documents in his hand since just now, but he now put down his things to look at Jian Xingsui in the eyes instead, \u201cNo matter how your past is, if you keep living in the pain of the past and don\u2019t put your eyes on the front, you will only have a hard time living in the present, understand?\u201dJian Xingsui understood, afraid that he would be misunderstood, he explained himself, \u201cI know. I\u2019m just thinking, since I\u2019ve terminated the contract with them, what will I do next.\u201dFu Jinxiao asked seriously, \u201cDo you want to quit the circle?\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t know what to say. He used to love music and wanted to make music full-time. But after splashing himself in the shallow parts of the entertainment industry, he realized that it\u2019s hard to live here, and that he might have to give up.But after changing so many things in this new life\u2026 he felt the flap of the butterfly wings. Things are so different now. There\u2019s a slim chance that he could do music for his living now.Looking up at Fu Jinxiao, in front of this person, Jian Xingsui never wanted to say anything against his will, nor did he want to lie. Although they didn\u2019t have a deep friendship, there was always subconscious trust in his heart.\u201cActually, I don\u2019t want to quit the circle.\u201d Jian Xingsui told the truth, \u201cI\u2019m just afraid that I can\u2019t do well.\u201dThe corners of Fu Jinxiao\u2019s lips curled into a smile, \u201cNo one is born capable of doing anything well. A butterfly doesn\u2019t know it can fly until it breaks out of its cocoon, and a tortoise doesn\u2019t know it can win until it races against a rabbit. Even me, I was also a nobody when I first stepped into this circle.\u201dListening to his voice, Jian Xingsui was full of thoughts.The boy\u2019s eyes were dark, and when he looked at Fu Jinxiao, his whole body leaned forward a little. His fair skin was like clear milk, and his whole body exuded a slight hint of sweetness. When he looked at him seriously, he was cute and adorable.It seemed that Jian Xingsui still hadn\u2019t figured it out. Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows and said in a low voice, \u201cI want to tell you: don\u2019t be afraid of difficulties, but have the courage to try and conquer suffering. But you keep staring at me like this\u2026 What do you mean by looking at me?\u201dTheir distance in the car was not too far.Fu Jinxiao sat lazily, his handsome eyebrows and eyes tinged with a bit of playfulness. Exuding the charm of a mature man, he said, \u201cCould it be that you are ready to conquer me? Or maybe\u2026 be conquered by me instead?\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dJian Xingsui suddenly came back to his senses, and hurriedly said as he blushed furiously, \u201cNo, no, no no no no, I, I wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201dFu Jinxiao gave a \u201ctsk\u201d, looking a little regretful, \u201cIt\u2019s not a good thing to be too timid sometimes. I think you should be braver.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s ears were so red that he didn\u2019t even dare to ask what he needed to be brave for. But he didn\u2019t dare to disobey the lesson of his senior, so nodded falteringly: \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll try to be\u2026 braver\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao gave him a mysterious, charming smile. Jian Xingsui could only nod with a blank look on his face.Uncle driver who overheard everything: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u2018Fu-ge, can you be a human being for once?\u2019\u2018I never knew that you love to bully your juniors like this!\u2019Having been Fu Jinxiao\u2019s driver for many years, he also understood Actor Fu\u2019s character. There were many temptations in the circle. His employer had a great reputation and high power. It\u2019s no surprise he was very sought after, but Fu Jinxiao had never let anyone get close to him. He was very cold and without a weakness, all his boundaries were clearly drawn.But now\u2026The driver felt as if he had seen a scene where a big bad wolf was bullying a little white rabbit.Half an hour later, the car arrived at the Shen family\u2019s manor.As soon as they enter the door, they can smell all sorts of appetizing aromas.\u00a0 They knew that the meal must be exquisite.There were two women sitting on the sofa in the living room, happily chatting. Xu Enzhen was a kind of gentle beauty, while the lady opposite looked very fashionable and glamorous, with dyed blonde hair, exquisite makeup, and countless jewelry on her body.Jian Xingsui entered the door and called out respectfully: \u201cMom.\u201dSeeing her youngest\u2019s return, Xu Enzhen immediately got up and greeted him: \u201cSuisui is back. Ah, you\u2019re here too, Jinxiao. You two came back together?\u201dFu Jinxiao said politely, \u201cHello, Auntie, excuse me.\u201dXu Enzhen hurriedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother, don\u2019t bother, what\u2019s the matter\u2026 Oh, what is this? You bring us a gift?\u201dFu Jinxiao had a polite smile on his lips, \u201cIt\u2019s just a little thought of mine.\u201dAfter Xu Enzhen opened it, she found that it was a premium silkworm thread that she had been looking for a long time. She couldn\u2019t hold down her smile, \u201cAh, this child, you really put your heart into your gifts. How do you know that I always want this?\u201dFu Jinxiao was very humble, \u201cI heard you mentioned it last time, and it happened that my friend had it, so I bought it for you.\u201dXu Enzhen was very happy.It\u2019s no wonder that the industry had such a high opinion of Fu Jinxiao. The eldest son of the Fu family was smooth and good at making connections. Although this silkworm thread was not very expensive, it was very difficult to find. Generally, it was difficult to get it without the proper connections. While it\u2019s true that as the Madam of the Shen family, she could get this with her husband\u2019s name, but getting it easily like this was very pleasing. Fu Jinxiao was very good at giving gifts, and the scale was always just right.This was also why Xu Enzhen was optimistic about this prospective son-in-law. She thought, if she could find such a good candidate this early, she wouldn\u2019t worry much.Xu Enzhen pulled Jian Xingsui and said, \u201cThank you so much for tonight, Jinxiao. Did Suisui bother you today?\u201dFu Jinxiao continued to be an exemplary guest, \u201cAuntie, you are too kind. Suisui could never be a problem for me.\u201dXu Enzhen was even happier, \u201cThat\u2019s really kind of you.\u201dJian Xingsui always felt that with the way his Mother treated Fu Jinxiao\u2026 there\u2019s some deep meaning behind it. He didn\u2019t know what, though.They all walked to the sofa, and the stylishly dressed woman also stood up, her eyes fell on Jian Xingsui, and she asked, \u201cYou are\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui was a little nervous, bent down, and bowed: \u201cHello Auntie, I\u2019m Jian Xingsui.\u201dFacing this glamorous but distant-looking woman, he couldn\u2019t help but to feel insecure. And part of the reason was that she was also Fu Jinxiao\u2019s mother.After the woman was silent for a while, she suddenly came over and held Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand enthusiastically and said, \u201cHi, hello, I\u2019m Li Na1hmm Idk if she\u2019s actually from abroad or not, but considering her blonde hair is dyed, I think not. So Li Na it is. If she\u2019s a westerner, I would use Lena / Lina instead., and I\u2019m your mother\u2019s good friend. You call me Mo\u2013\u201dFu Jinxiao coughed lightly, cutting his mother off.Li Na understood what her son meant, so she just smiled and changed her words, \u201c-I mean, you can call me Aunt Lili!\u201dJian Xingsui was a little confused at first, but felt that he might have misheard, so he obediently responded, and called out in a clear pronunciation, \u201cAunt Lili.\u201dLi Na looked at the well-behaved and sensible child in front of her, and her heart instantly melted.She has always wanted a soft, well-behaved, and cute child, but life was often unsatisfactory. She gave birth to Fu Jinxiao. He was the polar opposite of what she wanted.\u201cSuisui\u2026\u201d Lili held his hand, \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you. I heard of your previous mistreatment, but don\u2019t don\u2019t worry, those things will never happen again in the future. The men in my family won\u2019t let it. They can and will eradicate all your future enem\u2013 I mean, your troubles. You can rest assured.\u201dJian Xingsui: \u201cHuh?\u201dWhy did he feel that there\u2019s something wrong in her statement?Xu Enzhen also echoed at her side, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Shen family also will eradicate all your troubles.\u201dJian Xingsui: \u201c???\u201dLet\u2019s just pretend he heard nothing important.Seeing his embarrassed appearance, Fu Jinxiao smiled. He was keen to let his mother communicate with Jian Xingsui, leisurely watching it happen.Jian Xingsui was dragged by Lili into discussing many topics, and finally got a little scared. He subconsciously turned his eyes to Fu Jinxiao for help, and Actor Fu restrained his desire to bully this cute little rabbit after receiving that pitiful gaze. He said to Xu Enzhen, \u201cAuntie, I smell the aroma of a delicious chicken soup, did you cook by yourself today?\u201dXu Enzhen quickly responded: \u201cYes, yes, I almost forgot that! Since everyone is here, let\u2019s have dinner first.\u201dJian Xingsui asked, \u201cWhat about Dage and Father?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s common for them to work overtime.\u201d Xu Enzhen waved her hand dismissively, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to wait.\u201dJian Xingsui nodded. Finally, he could escape from Li Na\u2019s clutch.1hmm Idk if she\u2019s actually from abroad or not, but considering her blonde hair is dyed, I think not. So Li Na it is. If she\u2019s a westerner, I would use Lena / Lina instead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the table, Jian Xingsui naturally helped Xu Enzhen serve soup and rice, and helped Li Na carry the dishes, going back and forth very diligently.The Shen family was different from other wealthy families. Xu Enzhen really didn\u2019t like having many outsiders hanging around in her home, so she only kept Auntie Wu to help with the housekeeping. Many things were done by the family members themselves, but everyone enjoyed it and got used to it. In her mind, only when you were busy with your family could you have a sense of happiness in life.Li Na was very grateful, \u201cThank you, Suisui, you are so hardworking.\u201dJian Xingsui was very respectful, and he also followed the rules in doing things, and said softly, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Auntie. Is the portion enough? Do you want another bowl?\u201dLi Na was touched by the child\u2019s thoughtfulness and filial piety, and said, \u201cNo need! Don\u2019t worry.\u201dBut Jian Xingsui was happy to do these things. He loved getting the recognition of his hard work. In this warm family home, his hard work was affirmed, and he felt he was contributing to the family. He let out a sweet smile, \u201cNo trouble, no trouble, you are welcome.\u201dAs Jian Xingsui was about to serve a bowl to Fu Jinxiao, the actor stopped him. The man held him down with neither light nor heavy force, \u201cSit, I\u2019ll serve it. No need to move anymore.\u201dJian Xingsui looked up at him in surprise.Actor Fu got up and went to the kitchen to fill up two bowls of soup, one for his mother and one for Jian Xingsui.Li Na took a look at the generous pile of meat in Jian Xingsui\u2019s bowl, and nodded in satisfaction. At least her son knew how to treat his future wife right. This poor child thought he was orphaned before, and just now finally given the family warmth he deserved. He was very cute, so she very much approved of her son\u2019s silent spoiling.Li Na thought of a scheme. She coughed softly and said, \u201cSon, you should drink more too. Didn\u2019t you rush home two days ago and hurt your leg? You\u2019ve been busy with work, and now you can take a break. Hurry up and eat more.\u201dJian Xingsui paused, and looked at Fu Jinxiao in surprise, asking anxiously, \u201cAre you injured?\u201dFu Jinxiao glanced at his mother coldly, and knew what she was planning.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Fu Jinxiao said slowly to the youth beside him, \u201cIt\u2019s just a relapse of an old injury. I just need a rest to recover.\u201dJian Xingsui knew of this injury.In the early years of his career, Actor Fu accidentally fell off his horse. It was mainly the filming crew\u2019s fault. The injury was very serious, and even left him with a lasting health impact. If he was overtired and hit hard, he would relapse.Jian Xingsui couldn\u2019t bear it, and even felt a little sad, \u201cYou still have to check it in the hospital. If it relapses, you will further aggravate the injury. Why didn\u2019t you go to rest when you came back today? I\u2019m sorry to trouble you and Wang-jie to accompany me. I shouldn\u2019t have bothered you, I\u2013\u201dFu Jinxiao put down the tableware in his hand and said, \u201cI want to accompany you, what does it have to do with you?\u201dJian Xingsui was taken aback.Actor Fu was a bit aggressive this time. With the corner of his eye, he spied on Jian Xingsui. His eyes looked a little playful, \u201cI have a personal doctor, and he gave me a check-up a few days ago. It\u2019s nothing serious, I just need a rest. Overall, my health is still fine, so don\u2019t worry. If you really want to be grateful, contact Meican in two days and sign the contract.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dJian Xingsui said, \u201cWhat contract?\u201d\u201cFenghua Entertainment\u2019s contract.\u201d Fu Jinxiao took a sip of his soup with a spoon, then slowly put down the tableware, \u201cDidn\u2019t you need to sign a contract with an agency now?\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t expect that he could sign a contract with the legendary and famous Fenghua Entertainment!Although he didn\u2019t understand many things, he still knew that Fenghua Entertainment was\u00a0 the leading agency in this industry. Artists who could sign there were guaranteed to have a good future with good strengths to back it up.Jian Xingsui felt as if he was unbelievably lucky. He cheerfully asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t Fenghua Entertainment your agency? I can sign there too?\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d\u201cIt felt unreal!\u201dThe two sat together, their distance grew shorter. The Movie Emperor turned around, his voice was low and sexy with a smile, \u201cOr you don\u2019t want to be in the same company as me?\u201dOf course Jian Xingsui wanted to be in the same agency with his idol. He instantly retorted, \u201cNo!\u201dAfter saying it, he felt a little shy again.But Fu Jinxiao stretched out his hand to pat the youth in the head. His handsome face calmed down, and he turned serious, \u201cThen, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re willing to join. On behalf of Fenghua Entertainment, I welcome you in advance.\u201dJian Xingsui felt shy when his idol patted his head. With the warm overhead light of the dining room illuminating the man\u2019s handsome features, it looked like one of his pipe dreams. To be in the same agency with his idol\u2026 not even in his wildest dreams.After patting his head, Fu Jinxiao held his hand out and Jian Xingsui took it. The warm temperature of the actor\u2019s hand also warmed his heart up. The youth said humbly, \u201cThank you for giving me the opportunity. I will work hard. In the future\u2026 please give me more advice.\u201dFu Jinxiao\u2019s eyes fell on the young man, and a smile appeared on the corner of his lips: \u201cMhm. I will.\u201dJian Xingsui was still immersed in joy and was a little lost in thought.Fu Jinxiao whispered: \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201dJian Xingsui nodded: \u201cOkay.\u201dLi Na looked at them and deduced that Suishui should have feelings for her son. But he either hadn\u2019t realized it, or didn\u2019t dare to confess. She understood him, because she knew how ill-tempered Fu Jinxiao could be. Besides, her son\u2026 kinda has that perverted edge to the people he liked. He just had a black-heart and loved to tease the subject of affection.It\u2019s best to let nature run its course. She was looking forward to the day she could call Jian Xingsui her daughter-in-law.Since Li Na decided to let them be, she instead chatted with Xu Enzhen, \u201cDid you get the paternity test yet? Has Suisui\u2019s household registration changed?\u201d\u201cWe tested it two days ago. When the result comes out, we will change his household registration immediately.\u201dLi Na approved the decision. She looked at Jian Xingsui with a smile and said, \u201cThen, your surname will be changed into Shen from now on. Are you not used to it?\u201dJian Xingsui looked at Xu Enzhen and then looked at himself. He stopped his movements, thought for a while and replied, \u201cMaybe a little bit, but it doesn\u2019t matter, I like the surname Shen very much, and\u2026 I like this place very much.\u201dAfter the words were finished, Xu Enzhen showed a relieved and happy smile.Li Na also said, \u201cThat\u2019s good, this matter should end as soon as possible. A new household registration and a new surname to represent a fresh start at life, a brand new beginning. Come here, I have something to give you.\u201dLi Na was sitting next to Jian Xingsui, and he moved closer curiously.The woman picked something from her wrist. It was a jade pendant made of rope. The centerpiece jade was crystal clear and looked extraordinary. She gestured for Jian Xingsui to take and wear it. The youth hesitated, \u201cAuntie\u2026\u201dBut Li Na took his hand and said, \u201cMy mother-in-law gave it to me when I got married. This is like a family heirloom. This jade pendant also has the meaning of keeping people safe. Please take it, it\u2019s for you, I just hope that you will be fine and safe in the future.\u201dJian Xingsui looked at the pendant in his hand. As he listened to Li Na\u2019s words, his hand that was holding the pendant trembled slightly. He looked straight into Li Na\u2019s eyes, and saw how sincere she was. He was moved and flattered. He hadn\u2019t received anything good for many years, and now he suddenly had it, but he was a little panicked, \u201cIt\u2019s your family\u2019s heirloom, Auntie. It\u2019s too precious, I can\u2019t take it.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s my gift for you, It\u2019s up to me to decide who can or cannot take it.\u201d Li Na patted his hand: \u201cWhat\u2019s the relationship between me and your mother, you are still polite to me?\u201dLi Na sneakily winked at her son, hoping he\u2019ll get the implication inside her words \u2013 \u2018this is something passed on to the daughter-in-law\u2019.Fu Jinxiao received the signal, and looked at her helplessly. He put down the bowl and chopsticks, and said to Jian Xingsui in a whisper, \u201cSince Mother gave it to you, you can keep it, there is no need to be burdened, this bracelet has been worn by her for many years. Truthfully, she probably wanted to give it to others as soon as possible anyways. So that Father could buy her a new one as a replacement.\u201dHe was merciless enough to expose his old mother.Li Na glared at him, \u201cThis stinky child. If you hadn\u2019t bought one for me for so long, would I have to resort to this?\u201dFu Jinxiao ignored her and continued to watch Jian Xingsui eat.Xu Enzhen smiled, and also reminded, \u201cWear it well. This is your Aunt Li Na\u2019s wish. I have heard of this jade pendant. It is indeed very effective. It will definitely protect you in the future.\u201dJian Xingsui nodded seriously: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will.\u201dShen Xingchen, who was focused on eating well on the opposite seat, was dissatisfied by this blatant bias, \u201cMom, why don\u2019t I get any ancestral pendant?\u201dXu Enzhen glared at him, \u201cWhy would you need that kind of protective pendant? Your life is so easy anyways. Besides, our Shen family doesn\u2019t have that kind of heirloom accessories.\u201dShen Xingchen rolled his eyes, \u201cYes, yes, keep your secrets.\u201dJian Xingsui watched them quarreling and smiled. He touched the jade pendant in his hand, and a spark of happiness lit up in his heart. He was very much looking forward to the future. Life was so much better now, he could see all its beauty in full colors now.The next day\u2013In the Fenghua Entertainment building, Jian Xingsui signed the contract. Wang Meican shook hands with him, \u201cSuisui, I am very glad that you can officially join us. I will be your agent from now on.\u201dJian Xingsui answered in a very respectful manner, \u201cThank you, Wang-jie. To be honest, I really didn\u2019t expect you to accept me, I caused you trouble.\u201dWang Meican let out a genuine smile, \u201cThere is no trouble for me. While Fu Jinxiao did ask me to treat you well, I personally think that you have so much potential to dig. You\u2019re\u00a0 a malleable talent, and I haven\u2019t brought in newcomers for a long time. It just so happens that I have the energy to bring in newcomers.\u201dJian Xingsui was still very grateful: \u201cWang-jie, don\u2019t worry, although I don\u2019t have much advantages, but I will work hard and never worry you.\u201dWang Meican liked obedient children. He was so much unlike Fu Jinxiao, he didn\u2019t make her heart race in anger every so often. She quickly supported Jian Xingsui, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. But Suisui, since you signed a contract with me as my artist, there are one thing I still want to tell you. It\u2019s nothing big: if you fell in love, please tell me in advance.\u201dJian Xingsui was taken aback for a moment, obviously not expecting it, but still nodded shyly, \u201cYes, I will.\u201dWang Meican was relieved now, after all she knew that Fu Jinxiao would not tell her about this. Fortunately, Jian Xingsui was a very sensible child, and she really saved herself a lot of trouble. She knew that sooner or later, that wolf Fu Jinxiao would get together with Jian Xingsui. So long that this youth tells her, she could still be informed with this relationship.Wang Meican gave herself a thumbs-up in her heart, and then got to the point, \u201cThen let\u2019s discuss your work. In fact, I agree with you to focus on music. However, we do have an invitation for a variety show that has not yet been finalized. Your participation is still not finalized because it depends on the public opinion and your popularity.\u201dJian Xingsui was puzzled: \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know yet?\u201d Wang Meican thought about it and understood, \u201cIt should be because of your former agent, that doggy thing Wang Gangqiang1I checked back to previous chapters, his name was Wang Ye back then lol.. He didn\u2019t tell you that after the survival show finished airing, the \u2018Starlight\u2019 director team will launch a relatively large-scale reality show. If the initial plan is to be followed, all the debuting members will participate.\u201dJian Xingsui seems to have heard about this in his previous life. The director team of this reality show was really good, and the lineup alone was full of popularity.Wang Meican pushed her glasses up, \u201cAnd the director of this reality show is not the original director of \u2018Starlight\u2019, but director Su Ji\u2019an Su Da. He directed the filming of several popular reality shows in the past two years, so if you can get invited, it\u2019ll be a good resource to start your career.\u201dJian Xingsui hesitated: \u201cBut aren\u2019t all the guests already decided?\u201dWang Meican turned on her phone and showed him, \u201cIt\u2019s also your luck. They decided on a gimmick to invite other guests, one of which is a popular trainee who didn\u2019t debut.\u201dJian Xingsui: \u201cWho will be added?\u201d\u201cLook at the audience.\u201d Wang Meican clicked on a Weibo account, \u201cThis special guest is actually\u2026 decided by the public. There\u2019s a public voting currently happening to select who would fulfill this quota. All 102 non-debutants were put into the eligible list, and the netizens will vote for their pick. The first place winner will be invited as the guest.\u201dJian Xingsui heard about this for the first time today, and was happy and excited, \u201cIt seems that Director Su really understands the audience.\u201dWang Meican nodded, \u201cMoreover, Director Su also opened a special voting channel, which is to give 108 contestants the qualification to vote. They are not allowed to vote for themselves. Everyone collectively votes for a contestant who they think needs to be given a second chance.\u201dJian Xingsui really skipped on this. He was too busy mired with many troubles to follow the current news, it seems.The agent knew this just by observing Jian Xingsui\u2019s lost look. She chuckled and said, \u201cAlthough there are still two days before the end of the voting, the total vote by the public can be looked at any time. Do you want to go and have a look?\u201dJian Xingsui perked up.He knew that this was an opportunity he couldn\u2019t afford to miss. If he successfully became a guest, he could reunite with Shen Xingchen and Ning Ze, and he could even have the opportunity to meet and cooperate with Fu Jinxiao and Instructor Tuya again. Although this also means he might have to face Anran again, but compared to the temptation of the former, this amounted to nothing.Wang Meican adjusted the voting results page for him, and gave him a look, \u201cSee where you are.\u201d1I checked back to previous chapters, his name was Wang Ye back then lol.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you very very much to Hurricanezike and Minty for the ko-fi donations (\u00b4\uff61\u2022 \u03c9 \u2022\uff61`) the bonus chapter, as usual, will be posted tomorrow!Next ko-fi goals for bonus chapter (1/2)Jian Xingsui took over the phone and saw the real-time voting list on Weibo.#1: Jian Xingsui#2: Wen Shengge#3: \u2026After reading it, Jian Xingsui was a little surprised and said, \u201cIs there hope for Shengge?\u201dWang Meican pushed her white glasses frame and said, \u201cOf course, but only ranked trainee can become a permanent guest, and as for second ranked and below, they can only be a flying guest1temporary guests for an episode or two.\u201dJian Xingsui was a little disappointed at first, and then he happily asked something, \u201cThen if I lose the voting, I can still be a flying guest in the future?\u201dWang Meican didn\u2019t like the implication, so she disagreed, \u201cSuisui, I hope you can understand that no matter what the reason or the situation is, you must always have the mentality of winning. In this circle, if you don\u2019t advance, you will be a failure. Even friends can end up fighting over the same resources. Time and things will help you recognize who\u2019s your true friend and who\u2019s not. What you need to do is to move forward bravely, otherwise\u2026 \u201cJian Xingsui looked at her obediently.Wang Meican showed him the number of votes and their comments, smiled and said: \u201cAre you worthy of your loyal fans who support you?\u201dJian Xingsui looked down at the comment area and saw many of his fans:[Suisui, I miss you so much. Be sure to come back!][Can everyone vote for Suisui? Last time, my baby barely missed the cut-off and was very miserable.][I used the mobile numbers of my seven aunts and eight uncles to vote.][It\u2019s a pity to lose last time, but I will stand until the very end!][Don\u2019t worry Suisui, we will always be your loyal supporters~]Flipping through the comments one by one, Jian Xingsui saw the sincere comfort and encouragement from his fans. His nose suddenly became sour, and his heart was burning. He felt like he hadn\u2019t done anything enough to deserve such support.Wang Meican said as she stood beside him, \u201cSo, do you understand? If you lose the voting, if you don\u2019t work hard, you will disappoint many people.\u201dJian Xingsui\u2019s eyes gradually became firmer, and he nodded: \u201cI will work hard!\u201dWang Meican revealed a satisfied smile.But then, Jian Xingsui said in the next second, \u201cI have to find my trumpet2anonymous side account. Main account is called \u201ctuba\u201d btw. It\u2019s hilarious., and then vote for myself.\u201d ()\u201c\u2026\u201dThe agent fell into silence.Wang Meican felt that this youth was a little too silly, so she had to straighten his thoughts up, \u201cThere is not much difference between the one or two votes. If anything, I think you should post on Weibo. For example, you can send a selfie to your fans. It\u2019ll be a treat for them, especially since it\u2019s been a long time since you posted.\u201dJian Xingsui was sitting on the sofa, and when he heard the word \u201cselfie\u201d, he froze.Wang Meican asked suspiciously, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dJian Xingsui fought through his embarrassment to reply, \u201cI\u2026I\u2019m not very good at taking selfies.\u201dWang Meican felt that as an artist, he must have some skills, \u201c\u201dThen why don\u2019t you just take a picture here and let me see.\u201dOf course, Jian Xingsui would be obedient towards his agent, so in front of Wang Meican, he picked up his phone and took a selfie just like that. Even looking at his gestures was clear that his skills were dubious at best.Wang Meican: \u201c\u2026\u201d Well, at least he\u2019s not lying to her.She sighed and told Jian Xingsui mercilessly, \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way, Suisui, even my ten- years old nephew would take a better picture than you.\u201dJian Xingsui wanted to cry but had no tears.The two of them were talking, and Fu Jinxiao, happened to be back from the meeting upstairs. He was wearing a more casual black fit today, which was different from what he wore on the show before. The actor usually wore famous brands in private, and today, he was wearing a slim fit black wool sweater paired with a light coffee-colored windbreaker. The combination made him look a little more refined yet easy-going. His hair was not styled, but that didn\u2019t diminish his usual charm.Fu Jinxiao came in and said, \u201cThe talk is over?\u201dWang Meican saw the actor and she explained, \u201cSuisui can\u2019t take selfies. I want him to post it on Weibo, but he\u2019s not very good at it. I\u2019m thinking about finding a photographer.\u201dFu Jinxiao glanced at the blushing youth on the sofa, clearly ashamed on some level.In front of his idol, Jian Xingsui\u2019s shame level skyrocketed. Even down to his collarbones was stained with a flush of red. He subconsciously didn\u2019t want to look directly at Fu Jinxiao.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, leaning on the sofa to look at him leisurely: \u201cYou want to take a selfie, yeah?\u201dJian Xingsui responded softly.\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll help you take pictures.\u201d Fu Jinxiao reached out and asked him for his mobile phone.Jian Xingsui was taken aback.Fu Jinxiao half bent over, smiling: \u201cDon\u2019t believe me?\u201dJian Xingsui shook his head quickly: \u201cNo, no!\u201dHe just didn\u2019t expect that one day, Fu Jinxiao would actually take pictures of him. After all, no fans think that their idol would do that for them.Fu Jinxiao took his phone over, looked at Jian Xingsui again and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not okay to just sit here stupidly, you need to pose for a photo.\u201dJian Xingsui stretched out his hand stiffly, striking a stiff peace-sign pose.The corners of Fu Jinxiao\u2019s mouth subconsciously turned up. He found that Jian Xingsui was simply a treasure trove. Every time he met, no matter what he did, he could make Fu Jinxiao feel happy.Jian Xingsui was also ashamed and annoyed at Fu Jinxiao\u2019s smiling eyes. He put down his hands awkwardly, at a loss of what to do.Fu Jinxiao knew that he was nervous, so he put down his phone and walked in front of him, and began to straighten his posture personally. The man\u2019s broad palm was warm. He held Jian Xingsui\u2019s arm to lower it down, and took a book from the table next to him. He made Jian Xingsui look like he was reading it. The distance between the two of them was very close, so close that Jian Xingsui could smell the tiny lilt of Fu Jinxiao\u2019s pleasant voice, which made it sound more attractive than ever.His heartbeat subconsciously accelerated, and his whole body was a little stiff. That made Fu Jinxiao easier to approach and fix his pose. His brain seemed to be shut down and he couldn\u2019t operate.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice sounded in his ears again, dangerously close, \u201cJian Xingsui.\u201dJian Xingsui was taken aback for a moment, then came back to his senses, face still flushed, \u201cT-teacher Fu?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a professional photographer, but I\u2019ve worked with many. Why are you so stiff and uncooperative?\u201dJian Xingsui blushed. He anxiously replied to justify his behavior, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2026 I\u2013\u201dHe looked pitiful, actually. Fu Jinxiao knew what happened, he was just teasing him.The sunset outside dappled into the room, and a layer of golden glow was casted on the shoulders of the youth sitting on the chair. His face was slightly red, and he was holding a book with a few pages open in his hand. He looked inviting, like your nostalgic first love who was burned as one of your fondest memories.Fu Jinxiao said, \u201cSmile.\u201dJian Xingsui looked at him with a shy smile.The \u201cclick\u201d of the mobile phone shutter sounded in the hall of Fenghua Entertainment\u2019s office. It was also the first commemorative photo taken by Jian Xingsui as a Fenghua artist.After the photo was taken, Fu Jinxiao glanced at the youth inside the picture. He was shy and timid; the epitome of an innocent youth with pure, clean feelings.He looked too good to be shared with the whole world.Wang Meican came over and said, \u201cHow is it? Let me see?\u201dFu Jinxiao pondered for a moment and said, \u201cProbably not good?\u201dWang Meican was taken aback.Fu Jinxiao turned off the phone screen and didn\u2019t show it to her, \u201cGo and find a professional photographer for him. Remember to find a good one, the one I usually use.\u201dJian Xingsui couldn\u2019t clearly hear what they were talking about.He came over, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cNothing, don\u2019t worry. I will find a new photographer for you.\u201dJian Xingsui said \u201cah\u201d and looked at Wang Meican.Fu Jinxiao nodded: \u201cWell, but I think it\u2019s not too bad. After all, it\u2019s my first photography work. Can you send it to me via WeChat later? I\u2019ll keep it as a collection.\u201dJian Xingsui did not doubt Fu Jinxiao\u2019s words and did it without question. After all, there\u2019s no reason for him to hoard his photos \u2013 maybe the actor really didn\u2019t have photography talents and just didn\u2019t want others to see.However, Wang Meican, being his exclusive agent for many years, had a suspicion.Jian Xingsui said politely, \u201cOkay, sorry for the trouble, Mr. Fu.\u201dFu Jinxiao looked like a senior, with a usual smile on his face, and answered casually, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, and you\u2019re not a trouble.\u201dWang Meican, who knew that her earlier suspicion was correct: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe felt numb.Later, some netizens discovered that Jian Xingsui, who hadn\u2019t updated for 84 years, actually\u2026 posted something new!The boy in the photo looked different. His hair had grown a lot in these few months, creating a more delicate look after an appropriate haircut. He was sitting in front of a piano, elegant fingers danced across the key, bathed with the warm sunset light. His lips were polished with a natural-colored lip gloss, making it twice as kissable. His white shirt was tucked, and his posture was straight.Unlike his image in the \u201cStarlight\u201d show, he looked like a young nobleman now. His eyes were also much brighter than before.Jian Xingsui\u2019s fans shouted crazily:[I haven\u2019t seen you for a few months, Suisui, why do you look so good!][Little Bunny has grown up and become stronger.][It feels like my family\u2019s baby has just grown up\u2026][It always feels different from before, it seems he is more cheerful? More vivid? If you get my gist.][I think because he\u2019s happier now!]The caption for this Weibo post was short, but it was sincere.[Jian Xingsui v]: Recently, I am preparing to live a good life. Thank you for your continuous support despite my semi-hiatus. The days to come will be brighter. Let\u2019s face it together.His words were quite euphemistic, but it was enough to re-lit the vigor inside the hard-working fans:[Suisui, continue to live well!][Thinking of the days you lived in the Zhang family makes my heart ache.][I still remember that birthday episode\u2026 clearly you have the same birthday as that person, but the crew was cruel enough to only celebrate his\u2026][Wuwuwuwu3crying noises, although I don\u2019t know who your biological parents are, but I\u2019m happy Suisui is finally going to live a good life now!]Unlike many other star-chasers4as in, people who jumped through one celebrity to another. Casual fans., a huge portion of Jian Xingsui\u2019s fans was very, very loyal. ()Many people met Jian Xingsui through \u201cStarlight\u201d, and the reason why they fell in love with him was very simple. They saw him as a hard-working boy who wasn\u2019t appreciated enough. He wasn\u2019t the most outstanding, just another ordinary person who made his own miracles. Their hearts were especially abused when he had to brave rain and wind by himself, without any familial or capital backing.And just when everyone was giving their blessing, Anran reposted this Weibo post ten minutes after it was published. He attached a smiley face and a very positive message, \u201cLet\u2019s work hard together! Hope to see you soon, I want to treat you to a baked cake~\u201dThis post sparked another uproar.Everyone knew the story between these two. It was like a day-time soap opera, with many twists and turns. So, when these two clashed again, especially with Anran reposting Jian Xingsui\u2019s Weibo post with such a positive caption, passersby were grabbing their popcorn in excitement.As for Jian Xingsui fans, they were united on this matters:[Oh my God, bad luck go away.][Go away, go away! Shoo!][Stop being a disgusting person.][We know your true face already. Stop playing innocent. We are still waiting for your apology!]Of course, Anran\u2019s fans were naturally unhappy when they saw that Jian Xingsui\u2019s fans said this about their bias. They also began to guard him:[Why are you being so rude? Ranran is so kind.][They do have a misunderstanding before, but why do you hold such a grudge?][Let the past be the past. Learn to forgive others.]Jian Xingsui\u2019s fans laughed at these remarks. They haven\u2019t forgotten what kind of harsh words hurled towards their baby. That bullying scandal that was supported by those so-called \u201cclassmates\u201d, didn\u2019t Anran confirm by himself that it was just a fabrication?Everyone was so hostile towards Jian Xingsui, some even cursed at him to kill himself. Did they ever think that Jian Xingsui should be forgiven for his past actions?At the brink of another fandom war, Shen Xingchen, a man of justice, appeared. The young master also reposted Jian Xingsui\u2019s Weibo with the caption:[I\u2019ll see you soon then, didi. How about a brunch together sometimes? @JianXingsui @NingZe]It was different from Anran\u2019s reposting. Jian Xingsui quickly replied to Shen Xingchen: [Okay~]Ning Ze also quickly replied: [Yes, you can decide the time and place.]This interaction quickly became viral. A large number of melon-eating netizens became full after this amazing interaction \u2013 Jian Xingsui ignored Anran, but instantly replied to Shen Xingchen. Jian Xingsui was amazing, he didn\u2019t need to say anything about his past matters with Anran, he just needed to blatantly ignore him.The netizens were very excited:[Sisters, I really want to watch this new \u2018Bright Stars\u2019 reality show.][Hahaha, can\u2019t sleep because of the excitement just thinking about it.][I\u2019m not a fan of Jian Xingsui. I just like to watch and eat melons. I still hate Anran, though][Hahaha, I have to vote for melons\u2019 sake!][Originally, Jian Xingsui\u2019s votes were not particularly high despite him being number one in the rankings. But after this incident, his votes skyrocketed.His popularity didn\u2019t go down despite only getting bad news after \u201cStarlight\u201d. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite.

    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cannon Fodder Fake Master Was Stunned After Being RebornCH 48.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEnjoy the bonus chapter!While the Internet was buzzing, Jian Xingsui also received a call from his mother at night: \u201cHello, Mom?\u201dXu Enzhen\u2019s voice was crisp, with a hint of her usual affection, \u201cA-Sui, there\u2019s an auction in the south of the city this evening. There are many precious and rare objects. I heard that they are quite rare and interesting, so would you like to come?\u201dJian Xingsui immediately responded after hearing this, \u201cMom, are you going? If so, I\u2019ll accompany you.\u201dXu Enzhen\u2019s heart was warm, Suisui was truly her caring little padded jacket. This child\u2019s need for love and affection was very clear to her. Very fortunate because she also wanted to pour love for him in return.\u201cWell, I\u2019m going. All of us are coming, because it\u2019s a charity auction held by the Fu family.\u201d Xu Enzhen looked at the time on her watch and said softly, \u201cIf you want to come, tell me your address. Mom is going to pick you up.\u201dHearing it was held by the Fu family did explain why Fu Jinxiao left early today. Jian Xingsui nodded at himself, then asked his mother, \u201cOkay, do I need to change to a special clothes or something?\u201dXu Enzhen really didn\u2019t want him to be so reserved all the time. She smiled and reassured him, \u201cNo, no,\u00a0 no. Just use your usual formal clothes, or you can choose the one we have. Besides, you\u2019re very good-looking already, you\u2019ll look good in anything.\u201dJian Xingsui blushed, but he was actually very happy in his heart.Since returning to his biological family, he has lived happily every day. This has never happened in so many days in a row. If this was a dream, he hoped he would never wake up.As the evening rolled out, Jian Xingsui arrived at the venue alongside his family. Only then he realized that the \u201cvenue\u201d was actually just one of Fu family\u2019s many mansions. It was many times more luxurious than the Shen family\u2019s manor, which really opened up his eyes.Shen Xingchen said excitedly, \u201cI don\u2019t know what will be auctioned today, I can\u2019t wait!\u201dXu Enzhen shook her head in fond exasperation of her second son, and gave him some educated guesses, \u201cDefinitely antiques and art works. The Fu family is a scholarly family that has existed for hundreds of years. They have countless collections of antiques and ancient treasure, especially since the Fu patriarch is a famous calligrapher and painter. His collection is worth millions of yuan if you sell them all off. As for how many there are and how precious there are, I don\u2019t even know.\u201dShen Xingchen sighed and said, \u201cIf only Fu-ge could give me some of them when he\u2019s happy\u2026 easy way to double my net worth.\u201d\u201cKeep on dreaming, dear.\u201d Xu Enzhen looked at her silly son, and then at Jian Xingsui who was resting with his eyes closed, \u201cIt might be possible for your didi, though.\u201dJian Xingsui woke up when he heard he\u2019s being mentioned. He looked confused.Shen Xingchen said to nobody in particular, \u201cIt\u2019s time to get out of the car.\u201dThey got out of the car and walked inside. The Fu family really had a big business, and their family held charity auctions quite frequently. Each time, potential guests scrambled to participate, and the number kept increasing.Enemies do meet in narrow paths. Not long after arriving at the venue, they met with the Jian family.Jian Xingsui\u2019s face changed, but he didn\u2019t speak.Jian Kuo1If you haven\u2019t read my retroactively added footnotes on previous chapters: my mistake, I translated Jian Kuo as the eldest brother of the Jian family before. He\u2019s actually the father. As for the eldest brother, he\u2019s called Jian Gu. saw the Shen family group, and he took the initiative to come over. Unlike his usual indifference to Jian Xingsui, he walked over with a smile and a stretched hand,\u201dMr. Shen, long time no see.\u201dShen Yong put his arm around his wife. He kept his usual calm demeanor, answering him with only a tiny fraction of visible disdain, \u201cWe have not long ago. If I remember correctly, wasn\u2019t it at that land acquisition auction?\u201dRecently, Jian family was gunning to win favorable land for a project \u2013 and that project was proposed by Shen family\u2019s main company. So, in order to gain goodwill for a prospective collaboration partner, Jian Kuo had no choice but to curry favor. Especially since the Jian family paled in comparison with the Shen family.Shen Yong didn\u2019t shake hands with Jian Kuo. This made Jian Kuo a little embarrassed and upset, but he suppressed it and quickly glanced at Jian Xingsui. He then withdrew his hand and continued to smile, \u201cAhaha, it must be my bad memory!\u201dIn order to get close, Jian Kuo had to stoop this low. He hated it.\u201cSuisui, I actually met you here,\u201d Jian Kuo approached, wanting to hold Jian Xingsui\u2019s hand, \u201cHow are you doing recently?\u201dSeeing him, Jian Xingsui subconsciously rejected him. He slightly took a half step back and made Jian Kuo miss.The two of them faced each other. This seemed to be their first meeting in a serious setting ever since he left the Jian family. Jian Xingsui was expressionless as he replied, \u201cIt has nothing to do with you.\u201dJian Kuo smiled awkwardly, \u201cAiya, this kid. Why do you talk like that?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you teach me this?\u201d Jian Xingsui returned all his heartless words that day, \u201cYou said that I will have nothing to do with the Jian family after leaving that house. I am also not allowed to mention that I used to be a member of the Jian family after leaving. I was told to not embarrass the \u2018Jian family\u2019s good name\u2019.\u201dThe clear and crisp words fell, so that everyone could hear them clearly.Before that, Jian Kuo had always set up the character of a good father when he was away. Later, when he had Anran, he loved him in every possible way, and he showed it off. It gave the impression that he was a doting father.But at this moment, Jian Xingsui didn\u2019t hesitate to let everyone within hearing range know that it was just a farce \u2013 Jian Xingsui was like that during his stay.The faces of the Shen family suddenly turned ugly, especially Shen Yong, whose stern eyes swept Jian Kuo\u2019s body like he wanted to cut it into pieces.Jian Kuo didn\u2019t expect that his always obedient child would do this in public. He was a little embarrassed immediately, but he forced a smile and said, \u201cThat was just a momentary relapse of judgement. I was too harsh that day, because I\u2019m too emotional. Ah, this child\u2026 why did you take it so seriously? And I even offered to give you money back then, but you immediately rejected it.\u201dBefore Shen Yong could speak, Shen Minglang pushed up his glasses and said, \u201cMr. Jian, you are joking about a matter of that scale? If the head of the Jian family\u2019s enterprise is so fond of taking things as a joke, I do not like the implication of it. It make me doubt the ability and the credibility of the companies under the Jian family.\u201dJian Kuo choked up and wanted to explain, \u201cNo, you misunderstood, this is not what I mean\u2013\u201dShen Yong interrupted him, \u201cWhether it is a misunderstanding or not, since Mr. Jian once said to my son to separate your relationship, it is natural for our family to distance each other. We have to make a clear boundary between us. I think it\u2019s best for our cooperative project to stop here.\u201dJian Kuo\u2019s face turned pale.At that time, because Anran was injured and passed out, he was anxious. So he turned all his anger on Jian Xingsui. Even if there was no evidence, he didn\u2019t want to listen to Jian Xingsui\u2019s explanation. He hated that brat for hurting his good son.But had he acted gently that time, would today never have happened?The Shen family passed him by. In desperation, Jian Kuo grabbed Jian Xingsui\u2019s arm, looked at the child who he saw growing up with complicated eyes. His hoarse voice was clearly on the verge of begging, \u201cSuisui, that day I\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui stopped and looked at the man in front of him. In fact, he could break free and walk away immediately, but at this moment, looking at Anran behind Jian Kuo, he finally said to Jian Kuo, \u201cDo you know why I went back home that day?\u201dJian Kuo shook his head.\u201cBecause it would be your birthday in two days.\u201d Jian Xingsui said softly, a complicated feeling twisted inside his guts, \u201cI know you like the sweet-scented osmanthus cake made by Grandma Wang from a shop nearby. So I went there to buy some as a gift.\u201dJian Kuo\u2019s body shook, and he looked at Jian Xingsui in disbelief.He once received an osmanthus cake on the table, but he never thought it was given by his naughty and stupid young son. He thought it was given by the well-behaved and sensible Anran.Jian Kuo\u2019s heart trembled, and his eyes were moist: \u201cSuisui, I\u2026\u201dJian Xingsui steadily loosening the older man\u2019s grip on him. His eyes turned steady, \u201cBut now, I regret that decision very much.\u201dJian Kuo was stunned.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have gone and wasted my money like that,\u201d Jian Xingsui\u2019s lips twisted into an ironic smile \u2013 but it was unclear if it was for Jian Kuo or himself. His eyes sting, but his heart was relieved, \u201cBecause it\u2019s not worth the effort.\u201dJian Kuo froze on the spot. Jian Xingsui looked at him as if he was looking at a stranger, so unlike what he used to look at him when he was younger. He used to look up at him with a loving gaze, he used to follow him behind and call him \u201cDad\u201d with a sweet smile, and he used to always try to please him in his own clumsy way.He now looked at him coldly, like another passing stranger unrelated to his life. He once regarded Jian Xingsui as a burden, but when this moment really came, he froze in place.Something, somewhere shattered.It was probably a part of his heart.Jian Xingsui wasted no time to return to his family\u2019s side. He followed them to take a seat, waiting for the charity auction to begin.The status of the Shen family was very high, and many people would come to greet them. Most of them praised the Shen couple for their exemplary charity work.Jian Xingsui was a little curious about this matter, so he asked Shen Xingchen, \u201cOur parents often donated to charity?\u201dShen Xingchen nodded and replied truthfully, \u201cYup. Quite often, in my opinion. They donated to Project Hope2full name Project Hope \u2013 China Youth Development Foundation. A donation centered for helping improvised students by giving them scholarships, financial aids, and building schools in rural areas. It\u2019s not the same as the western Project Hope, which is a healthcare charity project. and others like it, mostly for children all over the country.\u201dShen Xingchen knew his parents had been donating to charity \u2013 both in private and in public \u2013 for a long time.He also knew it was done as doing good deeds in the name of their deceased son.Jian Xingsui was very curious: \u201cCan you tell me the charity names?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026 I can\u2019t really remember it at the moment,\u201d Shen Xingchen looked at Jian Xingsui meaningfully as he smiled, \u201cBut I think you\u2019ll be able to guess it one day.\u201dJian Xingsui didn\u2019t know what charade he was playing, so he just nodded.The auction will start soon. The head, his wife, and Fu Jinxiao \u2013 the eldest son and current heir of the Fu family \u2013 first came forward to pay tribute to the guests. After some speeches, the auction officially started.Shen Minglang helped his family to sit down, then he excused himself. He went backstage to find Fu Jinxiao for a drink and a chat.\u201cSuisui and Xingchen are going to participate in a reality show soon.\u201d Shen Minglang took a sip of his wine, \u201cPlease take care of the two of them there. As for Xingchen, you don\u2019t need to show him mercy. If he made a mistake, let him learn from it. He has been this wild and unruly since he was young, and it was time to temper him down with some hardship. I\u2019m afraid if he continues on with that young master\u2019s temper of his, it would lead to his downfall. As for Suisui\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao snuck a glance at his friend.Shen Minglang pushed his glasses, \u201cTake care of him more, don\u2019t let people bully him.\u201dFu Jinxiao\u2019s curled into an amused smile, \u201cAh, this Mr. Shen\u2026 you entrust me to take care of everything. I am your free nanny?\u201dShen Minglang knew that this old fox was not willing to suffer without benefits, so he offered: \u201cYou can pick whatever you like from my private collection.\u201d\u201cYour collection?\u201d Fu Jinxiao took a sip of his own red wine. While he looked sexy, Shen Minglang could see a hint of the actor\u2019s black-belly temperament behind his eyes.Fu Jinxiao smirked. He had an idea. \u201cI don\u2019t like those things.\u201dShen Minglang had an ominous premonition, \u201cThen\u2026 what do you want?\u201dSML: My big brother senses are tingling\u2026 I don\u2019t like where this is going.If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1If you haven\u2019t read my retroactively added footnotes on previous chapters: my mistake, I translated Jian Kuo as the eldest brother of the Jian family before.

After that, I will upload the bonus chapters (if there\u2019s any), but will not upload today\u2019s scheduled chapter. Thank you for your understandingThe next day was the day before the official filming of \u201cBright Stars\u201d. The netizens enthusiastically found out that Jian Xingsui\u2019s Weibo name has been officially certified to be changed!The name [Shen Xingsui] appeared in the public eye for the first time, and it immediately caused an uproar. Many of them started countless discussions and gossip about his life experience.[Did you go back to your biological parents\u2019 home?][Ahh so your surname is Shen now!][Wow, I think Shen Xingsui has a nice ring into it!]Someone shot a wild guess, [Do you think that Shen Xingchen and Shen Xingsui, who have always been called brothers, sound like actual\u00a0 brothers?]This guess quickly became the number one hot comment.Many people below also echoed:[It was very similar even before the name change. But now, the similarity is uncanny!][I agree!][But isn\u2019t Shen Xingchen\u2019s older brother called Shen Minglang?][Truly fated, aren\u2019t they? The two stars revolving around a sun and a moon~][Very family-like! I like it!]This statement quickly gained the support of the public. But the netizen quickly realized that the Shen family is a top wealthy family, and most people would not think Shen Xingsui\u2019s luck could really be so good. Especially when they remembered he used to be swapped with Anran\u2019s Jian family. There couldn\u2019t be such a coincidence, could there?Some netizens boldly said:[Then\u2026 Suisui shouldn\u2019t be the child of that Shen family?][Yeah, such a level of coincidence is basically unheard of.][But have you guys forgotten it already? Everyone agreed in the beginning that Shen Xingsui and Shen Xingchen looked alike!]Those words awakened the deniers. Because \u201cStarlight\u201d has ended for quite a while and this new reality show hasn\u2019t been filmed, many netizens forgot this old meme \u2013 it was poking fun at how these \u201cbrothers\u201d Shen Xingchen and Jian Xingsui really did look blood-related.Now that some netizens brought up this old news, people suddenly started remembering. This caused a chain reaction that sent Shen Xingsui into the hot search again.The Shen family was busy\u00a0 while everyone was guessing. Xu Enzhen was packing up for her two children who were about to go for filming.When Jian Xingsui went downstairs, he saw that Xu Enzhen was holding something in her hand. his hand. He moved over in curiosity and saw the white name tag in his mother\u2019s hand. It should be a name tag he would wear during the \u201cBright Stars\u201d filming.Seeing him coming down, Shen Xingchen beckoned, \u201cCome here and see your name tag.\u201dWhen Jian Xingsui came down, he saw the white name tag with black letters on a white background, spelling his name: Shen Xingsui.Shen Xingchen smiled as he stood beside his younger brother. \u201cThe Chinese character for \u2018Shen\u2019 is very pretty, much more pleasing to the eye than \u2018Jian\u2019. Right, Mom?\u201dXu Enzhen also had a gentle smile on her face, and she waved to Jian Xingsui and said, \u201cMy son! Come here.\u201dJian Xingsui hesitated for a moment, but he still walked towards his mother decisively. He obediently stood still in front of her, and breathed lightly. Perhaps for many people, this was just a word change, but for him, this was a very important event in his life.Xu Enzhen held the new name tag, looked at Jian Xingsui with moist eyes, and personally buckled it on Jian Xingsui\u2019s waist, sighing slightly: \u201cFrom today onwards, Suisui is completely a child of our family.\u201dShen Xingchen was leaning on the sofa beside him, half-joking: \u201cShen Xingsui, Shen Xingchen, hey, this name sounds like a pair of brothers. Does it mean that no matter how far apart we are, we are destined to be brothers by fate? Look, even before officially living as a part of the Shen family, we already have the same generational1usually given as a prefix for the same generation of a family. It\u2019s for easier recognition during family gatherings. Like, in one generation, a boy and his two brothers + one cousin all have the same Xing- name, resulting: Xingchen, Xingsui, Xinglan, Xinglu, etc. name. That\u2019s why it sounded extra special after the surname change.\u201dHearing this, Jian Xingsui was taken aback and let out a sweet smile. He was very, very glad for his name now. It\u2019s like the last thread that fate threw at him to help him find his family that was separated. Now, he had a newfound appreciation of the \u201cXingsui\u201d name.Xu Enzhen also had a smile on her face. She gave the child a big hug, and then said softly: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a new name, Mom believes that we will have a new, happier life from now on. Everything in the past will be left behind.\u201dThe smile in Shen Xingsui\u2019s eyes deepened, and he nodded slightly.After the heartwarming scene, Xu Enzhen then remembered her original reason to come here. She brought out a measuring tape, then called out for his son to come closer, \u201cCome here, boys. Mom needs your new measurements.\u201dThere were always various handmade products in the halls of the Shen family. It was Xu Enzhen\u2019s hobby. Now, she was aiming to make something new for the two of them, \u201cIt will be winter soon. When you two come back, Mom can make new winter clothes and hats for you.\u201dShen Xingchen said: \u201cMom, I don\u2019t need embroidery on my gloves this time. The one you knitted for me last year still had small flowers embroidered on it. It looked too girly! Not manly at all!\u201dXu Enzhen glared at him.Shen Xingsui didn\u2019t say anything after hearing this, but when Xu Enzhen looked over, he said a little shyly, \u201cThank you, Mom.\u201dXu Enzhen was softened by the child\u2019s obedience and understanding, and asked gently: \u201cSuisui, do you have any request? Mom can make any pattern or style you want.\u201dShen Xingsui shook his head slightly, and he said: \u201cI\u2019m fine with anything.\u201dHe still hadn\u2019t got used to such a level of spoiling, and probably never will. Those kinds of self-deprecating thoughts had rooted deep inside his heart, and it would take years to uproot the entire thing out.For now, he still didn\u2019t dare to ask extravagantly or make any demands, for fear that others would think he was troublesome. He was too used to receiving scraps, until the container of his heart couldn\u2019t accept this amount of love all at once.Xu Enzhen rubbed Shen Xingsui\u2019s head gently. \u201cOkay, then Mom will decide it for you. I hope you will like it.\u201dShen Xingsui smiled at Xu Enzhen and nodded obediently.On the way to the airport, Shen Xingchen saw that Jian Xingsui was still distracted, so he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, although our Mother is not good at cooking, her handcraft is top-notch. One of our family\u2019s businesses is clothing and accessories, and she occasionally puts some of her handcraft for sale, and they\u2019re very popular items.\u201dShen Xingsui was surprised and said: \u201cAh, so those handcraft projects I saw lying around are all done by Mom?\u201dShen Xingchen nodded, \u201cYup. You\u2019re on the dot. Our Mom is a very homebody type of person. Knitting, sewing, embroidery, crocheting\u2026 I think she has mastered them all. Furthermore, her crafts can be considered luxury goods because of how well-made and well-designed they are. Since they\u2019re all hand-made, there\u2019s only always one copy of each craft, which only makes her craft even more expensive.\u201dShen Xingchen omitted one thing: when he said Xu Enzhen\u2019s crafts were \u201cexpensive\u201d, he actually meant \u201cit sold for a ridiculously high price\u201d.One of the reasons for the sky-high price was scarcity. Mrs. Xu didn\u2019t like to sell her crafts to the outside world. She preferred to make it for her family, or make it into a house decor. Even if she had that talent and ability, she still preferred using it to knit two sweaters for her family in her spare time.Maybe this subtle act of affection was the reason that Shen Xingchen and Shen Minglang never felt unloved by their parents, despite how harsh they could sometimes be. With proper care and education, it was no wonder that both Shen brothers grew up to be exceptional people with a kind heart.1usually given as a prefix for the same generation of a family.

Each episode had a different theme and destination. Their first stop was a small town in the hotter part of China, which was popular for its rich traditional culture.The program group still adopted the full-scale live broadcast mode of \u201cStarlight\u201d, which was why the survival show was popular to begin with. Many viewers who religiously watched \u201cStarlight\u201d also watched this show. Therefore, on the first day of the program\u2019s launch, the number of online viewers has reached tens of thousands.When Fu Jinxiao appeared on camera, the viewers numbers exploded.[Fu-ge! Fu-ge!][I\u2019ve been waiting all morning to see my gege!][He\u2019s so handsome it\u2019s crazy.]Fu Jinxiao came out of the VIP passage, but unexpectedly, he met Anran who was waiting for him not far away.That\u2019s right, after experiencing that scandal with Shen Xingsui, Anran finally realized the seriousness of the matter. He always thought about how to make himself better, but later he discovered that his previous thoughts were simply not enough.Compared to him, how much better was Shen Xingsui?He\u2019s obviously not that good, but he somehow pleased Fu-ge.Therefore, it wasn\u2019t about how good or bad he was. The most important thing right now was to win Fu Jinxiao\u2019s heart. If he could marry into the top wealthy Fu family, he would always win in the end.To get his heart, he must increase his propinquity. Like could only sprout from like, and the more he appeared amazing in front of Fu Jinxiao, the more goodwill he would get.His only advantage was his first life\u2019s memory. He knew the time of Fu Jinxiao\u2019s flight arrival tonight, so he could use this to create chance encounters!Anran put up his fairy-boy persona, and went up to greet him, \u201cFu-ge!\u201dFu Jinxiao was wearing sunglasses so the audience and Anran couldn\u2019t see his frowning, the man\u2019s tone was flat but still polite: \u201cAh, Anran.\u201d\u201cYes, what a coincidence, Fu-ge. \u201cAnran smiled, \u201cI actually met you here.\u201dFu Jinxiao pushed his luggage with one hand: \u201cIsn\u2019t the director crew asked us to gather here? It\u2019s not a coincidence.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAnran choked up.The audience in the live broadcast room were a happy:[Hahaha XD Actor Fu you can play like this?]It was the hottest place in the country, so the guests were all wearing summer clothes. Anran had an idea he wanted to try. He still hadn\u2019t given up: \u201cFu-ge, are you tired from the long walk after getting off the plane? I have a bottle of water here, do you want a drink? \u201cFu Jinxiao didn\u2019t even think too long before rejecting him, \u201cI\u2019m not thirsty.\u201dAnran had no choice but to give up angrily.This was a very difficult chance to meet. He was always looking for an opportunity to speak up, to increase his relationship, but unexpectedly, he was ignored every time. However, he could comfort himself because he knew Actor Fu was a naturally cold person. He was polite to everyone, but never close to them.A group of people walked forward, and as they walked, Fu Jinxiao could see it was Shen Xingsui, Ning Ze, and Shen Xingchen for not far away. The three of them seemed to be shopping around a small stall.Fu Jinxiao approached them without hesitation.Shen Xingchen waved to this familiar-looking man, \u201cHey, Fu-ge, here, here!\u201dFu Jinxiao walked over, and his eyes fell on Shen Xingsui who looked very cute in a small white shirt. After seeing him, he took his sunglasses off. With a genuine smile on his lips, he warmly greeted, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dShen Xingsui replied, holding water in his hand, \u201cWe are buying water and waiting to drink it on the way.\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded lightly.Shen Xingsui hesitated for a moment, then handed over the water bottle: \u201cDo you want it?\u201dSeeing this, Anran felt relieved. After all, he had just been rejected just now. And now Jian Xingsui\u2013 no, Shen Xingsui actually started asking the same question. He was anticipating with glee to see him get rejected.Fu Jinxiao reached out to take it, answering with a low and elegant voice, \u201cOkay, thank you.\u201dAnran was taken aback.Shen Xingsui handed the water obediently, and asked, \u201cWhich brand do you want, C\u2019estbon, or Nongfu Spring?\u201dFu Jinxiao took one casually, clearly not caring of the brand. His smile got wider, and he praised the youth\u2019s hospitality towards him, \u201cYou\u2019ve got excellent timing. I have walked quite a long way and just got thirsty.\u201dShen Xingsui showed a bright smile when he heard his praise, \u201cIt would be great if I could help.\u201dFu Jinxiao unscrewed the lid and took two sips, which was very face-saving1as in, he keep care of SXS\u2019 dignity..These two people get along very happily and harmoniously. Anran, who was standing behind, was not in such a good mood. It was not an exaggeration to describe him as green with envy, but the audience in the live broadcast room is very happy to see his misery:[Hahahahaha!][Suddenly got thirsty so fast!][Oh, I just finished crossing a road, but now I\u2019m thirsty.][I feel sorry for Anran for a second.][He clowned himself, no need to pity him.]Everyone stood there for a while. Not long after, all guests got off the plane, and all of them were present.Tuya, Instructor Li, and Li Xu\u2019an came from the same flight. Xu Qinke and Feng Fan, the singer-and-rap duo came from a different flight \u2013 they actually got along very well together. After greeting the other guests politely, they all quietly stood aside, waiting for the cue from the director.So far, the division between the cast was quite obvious.Shen Xingchen only played with Ning Ze, Li Xu\u2019an and Anran could still talk, Xu Qinke and Feng Fan were relatively honest and didn\u2019t want to get involved.The director took them all with a car until they reached the foot of the mountain. As they arrived, the director introduced the place, \u201cFirst of all, welcome to the beautiful Taohuawu2\u6843\u82b1\u575e, literally Peach Blossom Dock. Town, where the four seasons are like spring and the scenery is picturesque. There are beautiful legends about this place in ancient times. Does anyone know what it is?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA gust of wind blew by, followed by a moment of silence.It was Instructor Li who took the lead and laughed awkwardly: \u201cI don\u2019t know, so I want to know!\u201dThen the others followed him with their own take, making the director not lose too much face.The director smiled, and then continued: \u201cIt is said that thousands of years ago, an ancient Emperor went to the south of the Yangtze River, and when he passed by here, he met a celestial fairy who came down to earth by chance. Knowing the past and the present, the encounter with him produced a beautiful story. Afterwards, the Emperor wanted to bring her back to the palace, but the celestial said that she didn\u2019t like the constraints in the palace. So when the night was dark, she left a letter, turned into a wisp of smoke and disappeared.\u201dAfter hearing the story, the audience in the live broadcast room began to complain:[Good guy, this is just a ghost story.][Such folklore existed?][There\u2019s definitely something wrong with this celestial fairy.]The director cleared his throat and said, \u201cSo our mission today is to visit this town\u2019s scenic spots. The town\u2019s entrance is just 500 meters ahead. We have already buried a lot of mission clue cards around those spots. Please follow the mission. In each card, you will find a scattered clue about a certain location. It is said that this is the place where the celestial fairy and the Emperor fell in love before the sunset.\u201dShen Xingchen said, \u201cDirector, what\u2019s the benefit of finding it?\u201dThe director replied, \u201cGood question, each card will be counted as a point, and the person with the most point wins! However, if there\u2019s a person who find that spot, they will be counted as the winner instead! The winner can enjoy Taohuawu\u2019s special luxury meals, and spend the night at the town\u2019s top luxury hotel. ANd as for those who can\u2019t find them, they will be punished in the end. Not only is there no dinner for you, but your lodging is\u2026 well, you understand the implication.\u201dAnran popped up again at this time and asked, \u201cDirector, do we need to form a team?\u201dThe director nodded, \u201cForm a team by yourself, two people in each team. You can assign them yourself. Each team has the freedom to explore the town at their own pace, there will be staff members receiving you not far away!\u201dFor this free assignment, most people were relieved. After all, they were quite happy, so everyone said in unison: \u201cThank you director!\u201d1as in, he keep care of SXS\u2019 dignity.2\u6843\u82b1\u575e, literally Peach Blossom Dock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he has been recuperating after returning to the Shen family\u2019s house, he was exhausted after traveling all the way. Still a little weak, so he just trailed slowly behind the team.Shen Xingchen was an impatient monkey: \u201cNing Ze and I are going to explore the way ahead, you wait!\u201dShen Xingsui nodded: \u201cOkay.\u201dHe knew that this guy loved to play, if he made him walk slowly beside him it would be suffocating. So he let his older brother do as he pleased.Slowly, Shen Xingsui became disconnected from the team, and he dangled behind. Just as he was about to entertain himself, he found that there was also a person in front of him walking slowly with a suitcase.Shen Xingsui moved closer, a little surprised, \u201cInstructor Fu?\u201dFu Jinxiao glanced at him, \u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Shen Xingsui was curious, \u201cThey have all gone so far ahead of us.\u201dAnran was annoyed, so he walked slowly on purpose. He mumbled something sarcastic to himself. However, he managed to restrain himself by making it sound like a joke, \u201cHe\u2019s getting old, and his legs and feet are not good.\u201dThis was supposed to be just a casual joke.Unexpectedly, Shen Xingsui looked down at Fu Jinxiao\u2019s legs and said, \u201cIs that old injury of yours still not healed?\u201dFu Jinxiao was taken aback.This happened half a month ago. At that time, he\u00a0 said casually at the dinner table, did this youth still remember it? Some people only paid a few words of greetings for their hypocritical concern, while others cared for him no matter how long it took.The corners of Fu Jinxiao\u2019s lips curled up slightly, and just when he was about to say that he didn\u2019t have any problems in this area, he heard Shen Xingsui say: \u201cBut you will have to run around the town to collect clues later. How can you overdo it if your legs are not well healed? How about this, let\u2019s team up and I\u2019ll try to find clues later while you can rest more.\u201dFu Jinxiao was silent for a moment, he seemed to be thinking about something. In fact, he was smiling like an old fox he actually was. He looked at the youth with a meaningful gaze, his voice was deep and magnetic, \u201cThis is too much trouble for you.\u201d\u201cNo it won\u2019t!\u201d Shen Xingsui was very happy if he could help Fu Jinxiao.Fu Jinxiao curled his lips into a smile, but the old fox\u2019s face was still upright, and he said slowly, \u201cThen I\u2019ll trouble you, Suisui.\u201dShen Xingsui: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dNetizens in the live broadcast room had a god\u2019s eye view of this scene :[Hahahaha, sisters, I always feel that Fu-ge is fooling people.][Our baby Suisui has been honest since he was young\u2026][Fu-ge also participated in an event two days ago. Let alone walk a short distance, he was able to trivialize moving things worth dozens of catties.][Sister, no need to say it outloud. Those who understood will type \u2018understood\u2019 in the barrage.][Hahahahaha, understood!]The rest of the guests walked into the small town soon, while Shen Xingchen was still waiting for Fu Jinxiao to catch up. He was going to decide to join his younger brother\u2019s team, but one \u201ckind\u201d glance from Fu Jinxiao was enough to deter him. Shen Xingchen still loved his dog\u2019s life, so he decisively chose Ning Ze.Anran could only team up with Li Xu\u2019an.Instructor Tuya was with Instructor Li; Xu Qinke was with Feng Fan.When they arrived at the town\u2019s entrance, they were greeted by the staff and were given some props for the show. After that, everyone began to immerse themselves in the activities and began to look for the clue cards hidden in the town.The person who was most active in stealing the show was Anran. Since he failed to form a team with Fu Jinxiao, he could only do this to increase his popularity and fanbase. As long as he won this game, everyone would naturally see his strength.Shen Xingchen and Ning Ze, in his opinion, were two stupid geese. They were not his opponents at all.As for Xu Qinke and Feng Fan, these two people looked equally as stupid and much less popular. They could be ignored.And he had participated in this show in his previous life, so of course he knew the location of all the mission cards. As long as he found it earlier than Shen Xingsui, and let Brother Fu see his own strength, the actor would naturally change his opinion and would come to form a team with him.The game started, and after ten minutes, the groups met once.Shen Xingchen asked how many mission cards everyone got, and Anran raised his face proudly: \u201cActually, this game is quite difficult, and the location of the mission cards is not easy to find. I spent a lot of energy and only found eight. \u201cShen Xingchen was shocked: \u201cHow did you find so much?\u201dThey only found three or four cards on average. The clues contained within these cards were scattered and quite cryptic, so it\u2019s hard to analyze the content.Tuya asked Shen Xingsui\u2019s group: \u201cWhat about you?\u201dShen Xingsui was a little shy and felt embarrassed, but he could only answer honestly: \u201cI only found one.\u201dWhen the others saw the last-placed team, they all laughed out loud. But because of this, everyone liked Shen Xingsui more. This youth was gentle and harmless. There\u2019s no need to compete against him, as he was very comfortable to get along with.However, there were also netizens who have different opinions:[Ranran is really hardworking.][He has always been serious, and he is also very smart.][Why is Shen Xingsui so stupid, don\u2019t make Emperor Fu lose the game. At least have a standard!][I\u2019m so angry, don\u2019t drag Fu-ge down!]The director said: \u201cOkay, the second round begins. And as for the special spot\u2026 nobody found it yet!\u201dEveryone immediately dispersed.No matter how chill Shen Xingsui actually was, he felt a sense of crisis this time. Before, he and Fu Jinxiao were just enjoying the scenery and relaxing. This time, he must be serious about the game. After thinking seriously for a while, he raised his head. \u201cInstructor Fu, we have to speed up our progress. Otherwise Anran\u2019s team would sweep all the cards and we will lose.\u201dFu Jinxiao looked down at him: \u201cHuh? I see, then let\u2019s speed up and find clues.\u201dShen Xingsui shook his head, and he said: \u201cI just noticed Anran and the others went in the opposite direction, so this area should have been searched. And even if there were some, the number should be very low, and we need to spend more energy to find it.\u201dIn fact, if Fu Jinxiao wanted to, he could easily win the mission, as long as his little friend actually had a desire to win.But when Jian Xingsui was seriously analyzing the problem, his eyes sparkled, his fair face was flushed, and his earnest appearance was very cute. That made Fu Jinxiao not rush to give an answer. He gave the youth more time to think about the solution. Besides, he would never reject a delicious eye candy.Fu Jinxiao responded lightly, \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201dShen Xingsui tentatively said, \u201cIf we ask the vendors on this street, will they tell us the place where the fairy and the emperor fell in love?\u201dFu Jinxiao shook his head, affirmatively answered, \u201cNo.\u201dShen Xingsui showed a bright, somewhat mysterious smile, and said softly, \u201cYou come with me.\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, knowing that he should turn around and go to another place to find cards to increase their chances of winning. Actor Fu had always been a relatively sober and rational person. But at this moment, seeing the youth in front of him who was much more cheerful than before, he still took a step forward, and his voice contained some helpless fondness, \u201cLet\u2019s go then!\u201dAfter wandering around for a few streets, they were about to deviate a few streets from the cameramen set up by the director.Under a big tree not far away, there were a few old women sitting on small benches to enjoy the shade. The two of them even peeled melon seeds and peanuts. Together, they were the gossip dissemination center of the whole town.Jian Xingsui and Fu Jinxiao looked at each other with a smile in their eyes.Usually shy and reserved, in order not to let his idol suffer, he walked over and asked, \u201cGrandma, how are you? I want to ask you something\u2026\u201dThe old grandma\u2019s eyes were different. The child in front of her was very good-looking. She answered softly, \u201cLittle girl, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dShen Xingsui choked up, and replied, \u201cGrandma, I\u2019m a boy.\u201d\u201cOh, little boy.\u201d Grandma said in a low voice, \u201cThen what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dShen Xingsui roughly told her about the legend, and asked: \u201cDo you know where that place is?\u201dGrandma and the woman next to her looked at each other, and then slowly said, \u201cSomeone came here to explain that I can\u2019t tell you. Besides, that story was too old, I can\u2019t remember it.\u201dShen Xingsui was a little embarrassed, but he did expect it to be impossible.Seeing his disappointment, Fu Jinxiao walked over and sat down. The man moved gracefully, spoke in a low and polite voice, \u201cGrandma, the radio next to you plays Beijing opera, and I often listen to it at home. It\u2019s really good, you have good taste.\u201dGrandma looked at the older man. Her pupils shook as she slowly said, \u201cYoung man, you look so handsome.\u201dFu Jinxiao smiled one of his extra charming smiles, \u201cThank you for your compliment, actually I have a favor. I need your help.\u201dGrandma said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dFu Jinxiao said slowly, \u201cI want to know the place where the fairy and the Emperor fell in love.\u201dShen Xingsui thought, didn\u2019t the old woman just say he forgot, why did Fu-ge ask again, isn\u2019t this a waste of time?What he never expected was\u2014The Grandma was still staring at the handsome actor, and after hearing the question, she turned her head slowly and answered without thinking too much, \u201cOh, I remembered. Young man, you asked the right person. Come here, come here, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201dFu Jinxiao smiled: \u201cOkay, thank you.\u201dShen Xingsui, who witnessed all this next to him: \u201c\u2026\u201dOn the other side, Anran managed to secure ten mission cards.He was assured of his victory. In his previous life, he couldn\u2019t find any cards. Basically, it was Actor Fu who found all the cards. Thankfully, he memorized all the places, so he could get a head start and proved his worth.Showing a determined smile, Anran was going to go to the director team to hand in all his cards.Then, just before he arrived at the handover place, he heard the director\u2019s voice from his earphone, \u201cThe winner of this game has been decided, Fu Jinxiao and Shen Xingsui\u2019s team is the first team to arrive at the special spot. They won the prize of this game: luxurious dinner and lodgings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAnran\u2019s eyes widened in shock, and he even blurted out: \u201cThey don\u2019t find so many cards, how did they get the location?\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast laughed like crazy:[They basically cheated!! Hahahahaha!][Anran, you\u2019re still too naive.][Who would reject Fu Jinxiao?][Hahahaha let\u2019s not talk about you, even Suisui, his teammate, doubted this as well!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I just woke up after a 16 hours sleep (\u00b4\u2229\uff40\u3002)When the winner announcement rang in everyone\u2019s earphones, all of them had similar reactions \u2013 shock and confusion.\u201cWait. Didn\u2019t Fu-ge\u2019s group have the least amount of cards??\u201d\u201cOh yeah, you can also win by finding the spot\u2026\u201d\u201cThis feels like cheating somehow.\u201dOnly Shen Xingchen seemed to be more used to this matter. He sighed, patted Ning Ze\u2019s shoulder beside him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised, this is a very normal thing. If anything crazy happened, it probably has something to do with Fu Jinxiao.\u201dIn his mind, Fu Jinxiao couldn\u2019t not win.And everyone seemed to accept it easily.At the end of this mission, because of Actor Fu\u00a0 and Shen Xingsui\u2019s unexpected headwind victory, it became a hot search, which sparked a heated discussion among netizens:#VerySueAndBornToEatThisBowlOfRice# 1(Very Su/Sue = very perfect man, like a gary stu. \u201cBorn to eat this bowl of rice\u201d = suitable for the job he\u2019s doing.)#ActorFuLoopholeOperations##FuJinxiaoShenXingsui#Shen Xingsui found out about this during the ride towards the next destination. He looked at it repeatedly, constantly refreshing the page, as if he wouldn\u2019t get tired no matter how many times he looked at it.Fu Jinxiao leaned over, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dShen Xingsui replied honestly, showing him the screen of the phone, \u201cLook, we are trending together.\u201d\u201cOh, so it\u2019s that?\u201d Fu Jinxiao glanced at him with a deeper look, \u201cYou looked\u2026 hypnotized looking at that. Mind telling me why?\u201dEven the youth still looked absent-minded when answering his question.In this regard, Actor Fu has a lot of opinions.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s words made Shen Xingsui finally out of his stupor, \u201cAm I in a daze?\u201d\u201cOh, uhm.. I\u2019m sorry, Teacher Fu.\u201d As a straightforward person, Shen Xingsui immediately apologized. But his voice began to get smaller the more he explained the reason, \u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026 may have looked into the tag too deep just now. And that made me lost my mind, because\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, \u201cBecause of what?\u201dFacing this unfairly handsome face, Shen Xingsui faltered a bit. He was a bit speechless, confused about his choice of words to explain what he felt. With a voice barely louder than the buzz of a mosquito, he said, \u201cBecause\u2026 it\u2019s the first time my name trended next to yours2the original was more like \u201cit\u2019s the first time I trended with you\u201d. Which was factually incorrect. He and FJX has trended together, although the tag was #TeacherStudent# during Starlight. So I changed it..\u201dThere was a moment of silence in the car.This enclosed space was very private, as there was no camera here. That\u2019s why Shen Xingchen dared to speak out his mind.Shen Xingsui couldn\u2019t understand what Fu Jinxiao\u2019s meaningful gaze meant. It made him nervous. Fu Jinxiao saw the youth\u2019s state, and he was once again tempted to tease him further, \u201cLittle friend, I didn\u2019t mean it in a bad way. I like the fact that we trended together. Did you think I\u2019ll be offended by the hot search? No, I just find your reaction a bit amusing. It seems that your ideological awareness still needs to be improved.\u201dShen Xingsui instantly thought his words were a bit misunderstood, so he quickly try to clarify his thoughts, \u201cNo, no, I mean, uhm\u2026 like\u2026 er\u2026you\u2019re okay with me seeing it, then?\u201dWhen he turned around to see Fu Jinxiao, the actor was actually smiling at him. The handsome man leaned back lazily on the car\u2019s plush seat, with half of his arm draped over the handrail, another arm propping up his chin. It was clear that he was looking at Shen Xingsui with mirth, as if he was fond of teasing his small pet bunny.Shen Xingsui felt a little annoyed.Fu Jinxiao looked at the youth\u2019s irritated expression and finally restrained his desire. He immediately rectified his previous act, \u201cOkay, okay, that\u2019s my bad. I won\u2019t tease you anymore. Here, I\u2019ll have something for you as an apology.\u201dShen Xingsui squinted at him in suspicion.Fu Jinxiao put a paper bag into his palm.Shen Xingsui asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201dThe actor immediately answered concisely, \u201cSugar.\u201dA bit confused, Shen Xingsui opened the small paper bag, and there were indeed granules of white sugar inside. He was wondering why would anyone \u2013 moreover Fu Jinxiao \u2013 gave him straight sugar. Normal people would instead give candy, right?Before he could ask, Fu Jinxiao answered, \u201cAunt Xu told me that due to overexertion during the past, you have some level of hypoglycemia. You just ran around all over the town, and I could clearly see that it has taken a toll on your body.\u201dActor Fu\u2019s voice was still gentle despite his lecturing words. He still felt like a strict teacher, but without a hint of anger in his voice. Overall, he still made people tremble.Shen Xingsui held the sugar bag, his eyes flickered, but he was speechless: \u201cI\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao said, \u201cTry it?\u201dHe opened his mouth and put a small sugar cube inside his mouth. The sweetness was overwhelming enough to pierce his heart. He subconsciously furrowed his brows and eyes. After getting used to the taste, he let out a genuine smile and whispered back, \u201cIt\u2019s very sweet.\u201dShen Xingchen, who was just napping on the front seat, jolted awake at the mention of this word. He automatically turned around to Shen Xingsui and asked during this half-awake state, \u201cSweet? What\u2019s so sweet? Sweet and sour pork ribs?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyelids to look at him, and teased the idiot-looking young master, \u201cThere\u2019s no sweet and sour pork ribs, but soon we\u2019ll eat sweet and sour abalone.\u201dShen Xingchen perked up, \u201cReally?\u201dFu Jinxiao pursed his lips, and said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m lying.\u201dShen Xingsui next to him couldn\u2019t help covering his lips and sniggering. Fu Jinxiao saw this and it only made his fake smile wider. Shen Xingchen, on the other hand, was devastated.Fu Jinxiao could bully him but he couldn\u2019t retaliate back!The car soon arrived at the town\u2019s top restaurant specializing in local cuisine. It was built according to the ancient pavilions look during ancient times. Vines crept along the gates and the walls, its green leaves fluttered as the wind blew. The antique buildings exuded a classical charm. After entering, an elegant incense lingered on the entryway, making as if you were transported to a by-gone era of the past.Since Fu Jinxiao and Shen Xingsui won, they could eat at this restaurant.The director said to the others, crushing every bit of hope they had in their heart, \u201cThis is not where you eat.\u201dEveryone was puzzled \u2013 if that\u2019s the case, why bother bringing them here? Making them green with envy??After leading everyone upstairs, the director pointed to a small stall not far outside the building and said, \u201cThat\u2019s where you can eat dinner.\u201d\u201c???\u201d What kind of difference is this!!Everyone was dumbfounded:\u201cDirector, how could you be this cruel???\u201d\u201cThen why did you let us come here?\u201d\u201cDirector, this is bullying.\u201dThe director cheerfully said without a hint of remorse, \u201cI asked everyone to come up to see the town\u2019s scenery together. From here, you can see the scenery of the dock, and secondly, let you all smell the local specialties and enjoy the happiness together.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe live broadcast room resumed, and the audience was immediately greeted by this large-scene of class disparity.[HAHAHAHAHA Oh my God!!][And the winner of \u201cLeast Human-like\u201d program crew goes to\u2026][I\u2019m sorry but I laughed so hard.]Just when everyone\u2019s faces were green with envy, the director finally regained his conscience, and said:\u201cOkay, I also know that it may be a bit unacceptable to everyone. So\u2026 how about this. Everyone can give a performance, and if the winning team judged them as satisfactory, you can have a meal in this restaurant!\u201d1(Very Su/Sue = very perfect man, like a gary stu. \u201cBorn to eat this bowl of rice\u201d = suitable for the job he\u2019s doing.)2the original was more like \u201cit\u2019s the first time I trended with you\u201d. Which was factually incorrect. He and FJX has trended together, although the tag was #TeacherStudent# during Starlight. So I changed it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Compared to the modest roadside stalls, eating in this luxurious restaurant was like heaven on earth. Besides, they were all celebrities, of course they have some skills to impress others, so this turn of event was very beneficial for them.And as for the members of the boy group, they knew this was a perfect platform to show off their progress after the survival show ended.They started taking turns performing.Tuya and Instructor Li sang a classic song called \u201cSpice Girls & Love Songs\u201d, which received unanimous praise from everyone.Anran and Li Xu\u2019an performed a recent idol song. Their performance wasn\u2019t anything special, but everyone agreed on saving their dignity so they were given a pass.When it was Shen Xingchen\u2019s turn, he looked excited.Shen Xingchen said: \u201cI don\u2019t have any special talent, I will perform a backflip for everyone!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone laughed.Shen Xingchen, this monkey boy, did a few backflips. Not to mention, his movements were chic and neat, very beautiful, and easily gained approval from everyone.As everyone finished their own performance, the director finally let them sit around a big table to enjoy dinner. After the meal, everyone was more leisurely and spread out, looking at the breathtaking nighttime scenery or wandering around.Suddenly, Instructor Li had a flash of inspiration. He looked at the winning team with an amused smile and proposed an after-dinner show. \u201cFu-ge, Suisui, you two have watched us all perform. Why don\u2019t you show us some unique skills in return?\u201dTuya got excited after hearing this, and quickly echoed: \u201cYes, yes, I agree. Old Fu, you can\u2019t refuse us~\u201dFu Jinxiao had a good relationship with both mentors. He curled his lips into a small smile and teasingly said, \u201cEven eating a dinner this good can\u2019t stop you two from wanting to watch a show?\u201dInstructor Li laughed heartily, \u201cIt\u2019s not just us who want to see it, the audience also wants to see it!\u201dEveryone\u2019s enthusiasm was very high, and it was not easy to refuse. Shen Xingsui was thinking of what he could showcase. If he botched this one, he would\u2019ve become a laughingstock for the rest of the show.Fu Jinxiao glanced at the troubled-looking youth beside him, and put down his chopsticks: \u201cAlright, I agree.\u201dTuya teased him with a good-natured smile, \u201cOhh~ such a rare occurrence. What does Instructor Fu want to show us?\u201d\u201cI have learned some traditional Chinese medical skills.\u201d Fu Jinxiao decided to do the absurd talent route. He looked all serious and said to them, \u201cDo you want me to test your pulse?\u201dThe other guests were surprised, so of course they all nodded and agreed.The audience were also quite shocked. The barrage, once again, was filled to the brim:[Fu-ge, you still hide such a talent!][Hahaha, Fu-ge is indeed Fu-ge. Only he can bring this kind of unexpected development!][Hmmm\u2026 what other secrets are you hiding from us~]While Fu Jinxiao offered to take everyone\u2019s pulses, only his Instructor Li and Tuya came forward. The two of them have a good relationship with the actor, so this could be played as a joke between close friends.Fu Jinxiao really didn\u2019t just talk about it. He put his fingers on Tuya\u2019s wrist for a moment, and deducted her health from the information he gathered, \u201cI think you\u2019ve been getting angry or overexhausted lately. Your blood pressure is a little on the high side. It should be because your work schedule is\u00a0 too tight. Get more rest and drink plenty of water. You can help by drinking some chrysanthemum tea.\u201dTuya nodded.Fu Jinxiao took Instructor Li\u2019s pulse, and all his deductions and suggestions were quite on-point. On the side, his little fan Shen Xingsui was looking at the actor with stars inside his eyes.It would be Shen Xingchen\u2019s turn next. Fu Jinxiao withdrew his hand and gave a few words of advice, Shen Xingsui praised him without hesitation: \u201cFu-ge, you are really amazing\u2026!\u201dWhile letting Fu Jinxiao do his thing, the rest of them continued their chatter.Shen Xingsui was not very good at blending into the environment. When everyone was chatting happily, he could only sit on a chair not far away and pretend to watch the scenery while secretly watching the other guests.However, Fu Jinxiao casted his gaze over. The actor would always notice him amidst the crowd, no matter the circumstances.\u00a0 He then glanced at Shen Xingsui\u2019s hand, \u201cLittle Comrade Jian, would you like to try?\u201dShen Xingsui immediately nodded. He hesitated a little bit, but he really wanted the experience. \u201cI really can?\u201dFu Jinxiao curled his lips up, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you? Is there anything wrong?\u201dNot far away, Anran and the others walked towards them. Anran actually had already counted when his turn was going to be. Fu Jinxiao didn\u2019t have many people around him, so after Shen Xingchen, it should be his turn as long as he got closer. However, as he inched closer, he saw Fu Jinxiao actually took the initiative to call Shen Xingsui.Li Xu\u2019an saw all this and sneered, as if to laugh at Anran\u2019s desperate attempt. After all, he wasn\u2019t stupid \u2013 he knew exactly what Anran wanted.Shen Xingsui didn\u2019t know what was happening to Anran right now. He was fully concentrating on Fu Jinxiao as he sat on a sofa opposite of the actor. \u201cCan I sit here, then?\u201dFu Jinxiao beckoned to him. \u201cNo, come here instead.\u201dThe actor patted the sofa by his side.Shen Xingsui felt a little doubt budding in his heart. The others didn\u2019t seem to sit so close just now. But he wouldn\u2019t refuse the opportunity to sit next to Movie Emperor Fu. As he obediently sat closer, he could feel the older man\u2019s body warmth and smell his cologne.Other guests were watching, and yet, they were this close\u2026 it felt too intimate, somehow.Fu Jinxiao bent down and moved closer. He spoke to the youth with a low and magnetic voice: \u201cGive me your hand.\u201dShen Xingsui nodded as if he was enthralled by the (admittedly) sexy voice. He stretched out his hand obediently while muttering an \u201cOkay\u201d.The surroundings seemed to have quieted down. Fu Jinxiao\u2019s bony fingers rested on Shen Xingsui\u2019s fair wrist, caressing it gently. The actor clearly spent more time compared to diagnosing Shen Xingchen. Because of the longer time it took, it would inevitably make other people get a little anxious.Tuya was very worried, \u201cIs there anything wrong?\u201dShen Xingchen knew Fu Jinxiao was just bullying his younger brother, so he couldn\u2019t spit out ivory1(original: \u72d7\u5634\u91cc\u5410\u4e0d\u51fa\u8c61\u7259 or \u201ca dog can\u2019t spit out ivory\u201d. It means \u201ca filthy mouth cannot utter decent language\u201d and well, in this case, it\u2019s more like SXC couldn\u2019t bring himself to say anything decent about FJX. His big bro instinct must\u2019ve gone haywire seeing wrist caressing motions lol.). He gritted his teeth and answered as if he was convulsing, \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone was silent for a while.The audience in the live broadcast room finally understood. They laughed together:[Little Shen! You know something fishy is happening, didn\u2019t you?][I kinda feel like\u2026 it\u2019s more than okay if it\u2019s Shen Xingsui\u2026?][Upstairs, I understand you.]It was such a close contact with Fu Jinxiao. Even from his first life, he would never have dreamed of this kind of closeness happening. With the distance between them effectively being zero, Shen Xingsui had the HD view of his idol\u2019s handsome face and felt his breathing tickling his ears.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyelids and met Shen Xingsui\u2019s eyes. There seemed to be some unknown emotion in the man\u2019s eyes. But soon a smile slowly covered them, and he curled his lips: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious, just pay more attention to rest. Just don\u2019t be too tired.\u201dThe others breathed a sigh of relief.Just at this time, the director team asked everyone to go downstairs to gather. So everyone went outside again.However, Shen Xingsui inexplicably felt that Actor Fu looked like he had something to say. But in the end, the actor didn\u2019t say anything.After everyone else went downstairs, he followed Fu Jinxiao, and finally mustered up his courage, \u201cTeacher Fu, I\u2026 Is there something wrong with my body? Is it not convenient for you to tell me just now?\u201dFu Jinxiao looked at the youth with the corner of his eyes.Shen Xingsui took a deep breath, and finally decided to say, \u201cActually, it doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. I\u2019m prepared. I can bear it. Please tell me honestly!\u201dThe movie emperor couldn\u2019t hold back his wolf-like desires anymore. This youth existed to be teased by him. He used his excellent acting skills as if nothing important was happening. His pace was unhurried, as he leaned over and whispered, \u201cYou really want to hear it?\u201dShen Xingsui\u2019s expression became more serious, \u201cI really want to hear it.\u201d\u201cOkay then.\u201d Fu Jinxiao finally bent down. He was about a head taller than Shen Xingsui, and their stature difference looked more emphasized when Fu Jinxiao was this close to Shen Xingsui. With a breathy whisper, he said, \u201cActually, just now, I didn\u2019t get any results from the diagnosis.\u201dShen Xingsui was taken aback.But he didn\u2019t understand why that happened. Fu-ge\u2019s medical skills should be fine, as he could make a good diagnosis for Instructor Tuya and the others. So why couldn\u2019t Fu Jinxiao get a read of his health now?Fu Jinxiao seemed to understand his doubts. The actor\u2019s voice was slow, magnetic and sexy. It was a dizzying mixture of a mature man\u2019s charm.\u201cBecause your heart beats too fast, baby.\u201dIf you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1(original: \u72d7\u5634\u91cc\u5410\u4e0d\u51fa\u8c61\u7259 or \u201ca dog can\u2019t spit out ivory\u201d.

We have double chapters update today!Ko-fi donation goals to the next bonus chapter (1/2)Shen Xingsui felt that his ears and body started to burn.These\u2026 dangerous words were too sudden. He thought he was having auditory hallucinations or something. How could he\u2026 huh? Why? What??In an instant, his face turned red like a boiled shrimp. His face, his ears, his neck\u2026 even down his chest were all flushing red. After hearing this rogue sentence, he even felt ashamed\u2026 Ugh, why was his heart beating so fast? It\u2019s too embarrassing!Fu Jinxiao straightened his body again. He was looking forward to seeing the youth\u2019s reaction.However, before Shen Xingsui could speak, he bolted away like a scared little rabbit!Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, and heard chaotic footsteps echoing in the hallway. That little rabbit sure ran away quickly, as if there was some scourge chasing behind him.The actor was silent for a while before letting out a muffled laughter.Shen Xingsui ran downstairs, and several people downstairs looked at him suspiciously.Shen Xingchen asked curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dShen Xingsui panicked, panting heavily while shaking his head, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dThe cameramen downstairs were still there, and they all looked at each other curiously. They were all regretting that no one stayed upstairs just now, not knowing what happened.Shen Xingchen teased his younger brother and said, \u201cLooking like this, did someone eat your tofu1a more\u2026 soft? Less scummy? molestation. Like, it doesn\u2019t have as much as negative connotation as actual molestation. or something?\u201dShen Xingsui blushed even more. He already looked quite delicate, but with this furious blush, he looked like a girl from a good family who met a pervert while she was running.Seeing that he didn\u2019t speak, Shen Xingchen got excited. He put his shoulders on Shen Xingsui\u2019s shoulder and joked, \u201cEven if there are really some perverts going at you, you don\u2019t have to be afraid. Erge will stand up for you, and I will definitely protect you. Let me see who dares to bully you. I will definitely slap\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao, who was upstairs just now, walked downstairs.Compared to the shy and flustered Shen Xingsui, Fu Jinxiao was very calm and relaxed. He came over and just heard Shen Xingchen\u2019s words, and asked lightly, \u201cSlap who?\u201dShen Xingchen froze from pure reflex. His gut instinct warned him that if he answered wrong, he\u2019ll be (metaphorically) fucked. He shrank his neck and meekly said, \u201cSlap myself!!\u201dShen Xingsui next to him: \u201c?\u201dThe viewers in the live broadcast room were also impressed by these two reactions:[The pecking order here is very clear.][Hahaha, our Young Master Shen can be cowardly at times too!][What, you just sold your didi like this?][Suisui is confused now.]All of the guests and crew chatted happily, only Anran nearby wasn\u2019t very happy. In his previous life, he was still very popular during this reality show. He had many good friends, he was very well-cared for by Actor Fu, he had many shots, and his missions were done smoothly. He was the natural center of attention, as he should be.He still didn\u2019t understand why everything went to shit in this rebirth.Not only did he fail to become the center of the crowd, he was completely ignored. He thought that with his previous life\u2019s experience, everything would be far easier! Who knew his effort would be in vain and a waste of time!It\u2019s all Shen Xingsui\u2019s fault\u2026If it weren\u2019t for him, maybe everything would be fine.The director not far away came over and said, \u201cSince everyone has finished eating, we will take you to your respective lodgings. But before that, we will give you the relevant benefits.\u201d\u201cWe have benefits?\u201dThe director smiled and said, \u201cOf course, but only the winning group that completes the task can enjoy the benefits.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe director was technically telling the truth, but that did not diminish their bloodlust towards him.It only amplified it.The director asked the staff behind to take out a few trays. He introduced the items enthusiastically, \u201cIt\u2019s like this, everyone. The winning team members can choose a reward item by themselves. As for the losing team\u2026 well.\u201d The director\u2019s smile only got wider.Shen Xingsui took a closer look, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be a\u2026 mosquito repellent kit. Mosquito net, anti-bug spray, mosquito coil\u2026 and others.Fu Jinxiao said, \u201cYou take it first.\u201dShen Xingsui refused, \u201cIt\u2019s okay Teacher Fu, you can take whatever you want first.\u201dFu Jinxiao lazily glanced at him. He coaxed the youth with a gentle tone that was hard to deny, \u201cJust choose whichever you like. I\u2019ll defer to you.\u201dShen Xingsui finally became honest, and he picked out the mosquito net.The experienced Instructor Li later lamented, \u201cWhy do I suddenly have an ominous feeling when I see these things?\u201dTuya raised her head, \u201cDirector, didn\u2019t you say that we are going to live in a luxurious suite?The said director gave everyone a smile: \u201cOf course everyone, we will not tell lies. If we said it\u2019s a luxurious suite, then it is. You will know when you get there. Don\u2019t worry~\u201dFive minutes later\u2013Everyone arrived at the southernmost part of the small town. It seemed to be an antique mansion of sorts. It had a majestic gate, painted in crimson; there were two red lanterns hung on it, swaying in the wind. Beside the entrance, there were two finely-carved stone lions. The vegetation was also lush and tall. On top of that, there were people dressed like servants carrying lanterns, as if welcoming their arrival.The director gestured grandly, \u201cEveryone, welcome to Taohua2\u201cPeach Blossom\u201d. The same Taohua as the name of the town. Villa. According to legend, this is the summer resort where Emperor Shengzu lived in the south of the Yangtze River. For the next five days, we will temporarily\u00a0 stay here to experience the people and customs of Taohuawu Town!\u201dThe mansion very much lived to the legends. It did looked-like an Imperial residence of the olden days; antique, opulent, full of history.There was also a small pond in the backyard, which would be beautiful during the day. The garden was full of flowers and unknown vegetation. However, because the climate here was hot, some moths and bugs could even be seen under the dim lights.Shen Xingchen complained, \u201cI think a mosquito bit me just now.\u201dWalking beside him, Shen Xingsui was concerned, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cLook.\u201d Shen Xingchen showed his arm, \u201cI have a big red bump on my arm. Those blood-suckers are definitely biting me!\u201dShen Xingsui saw that it was true. Shen Xingchen patted his neck and scratched his arm as he continued his complaint, \u201cHere comes another one! Arrghhh, why do they love me so much?\u201dHe looked at his younger brother beside him. He had no bites.Just when Shen Xingsui was puzzled, a voice came from beside him to explain his doubts. It was actually Li Xu\u2019an. This person\u2019s popularity had always been relatively high, and he was the pillar of Bankrupt Entertainment. All of that company\u2019s top resources were all given to Li Xu\u2019an. He basically could walk sideways3do whatever he wants without repercussions. there.Li Xu\u2019an explained, \u201cHe has a physique that attracts mosquitoes. It\u2019s always been like this.\u201dShen Xingsui was a little surprised.Li Xu\u2019an got a fan from nowhere, and handed it to Shen Xingchen, \u201cYou will be much better if you use this fan, the mosquitoes will not be able to get close to you.\u201dHowever, Shen Xingchen slapped the fan away, \u201d No, no, keep it to yourself!\u201dLi Xu\u2019an could be considered a well-known person, but he was not angry when Shen Xingchen spoke in such a tone.Only now did Shen Xingsui remember that Shen Xingchen had always disliked Li Xu\u2019an from before. He considered Li Xu\u2019an as his mortal enemy. During \u201cStarlight\u201d, they were fighting for the C position. And Shen Xingchen really gave his all to win that position.If anything, this all made Shen Xingsui wonder what happened in the first place between them. However, this wasn\u2019t a topic that\u2019s easy to be breached.The director interrupted his train of thoughts, \u201cOkay, here we go. Everyone take your room card, and go back to your own room.\u201dShen Xingchen had already been bitten several times, and his level of complaints only rose.Seeing the numerous mosquito bites littered his older brother\u2019s body, Shen Xingsui pitied him,\u00a0 \u201cIs it itchy? You should feel better when you get to your room. Hurry up, go there.\u201dShen Xingchen nodded quickly: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do that.\u201dThe rooms that the program crew assigned to all of them were relatively close.Shen Xingsui found his room according to the number. After pushing the door and entering, he found that the room was clean, except that one window was open. When he saw the opened window, he felt a little ominous.It was currently a hot summer, so he went to the shower room at the back to take a shower. When he came out, he wanted to hang the mosquito net on the bed. While he was busy, he was disturbed by a mosquito.The cameraman assigned to him also was back by his side.Shen Xingsui mumbled to nobody in particular, \u201cThe mosquitoes sure are plenty here\u2026 thankfully, they didn\u2019t bite me too much. With this kind of situation, it would be hard to get a peaceful sleep here.\u201dThe cameraman commented, \u201cShen Xingchen next door was bitten by mosquitoes several times\u201dAfter hearing this, Shen Xingsui was both amused but also distressed.Netizens in the live broadcast room also said with sympathy:[It\u2019s extra hard for Shen Xingchen with that kind of mosquito-magnet physique\u2026][Yeah, the buzzing and itchiness really makes it hard to sleep.]Shen Xingsui finally decided, \u201cI\u2019ll go and see him.\u201dThe door of Xingchen\u2019s room was left open, so Shen Xingsui easily came in. Fu Jinxiao just happened to walk past his room, coming back from the shower room outside.As soon as Shen Xingchen saw these two people, he seemed to see a savior. Without a hesitation, he ran over to Fu Jinxiao and said, \u201cFu-ge, my savior, please spare me a tiiinyyy bit of your mosquito repellent spray\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao knew that the young master couldn\u2019t bear this suffering. But then he remembered Shen Minglang\u2019s words of letting Shen Xingchen experience \u201cthe way of the world\u201d.\u201cYou close this window later.\u201d Fu Jinxiao said as he pointed at it, \u201cIsn\u2019t this room equipped with an air conditioner for you? As soon as the temperature drops, the mosquitoes will naturally stop biting you.\u201dShen Xingchen whined without dignity, \u201cThat won\u2019t work for me! My body is just weirdly attractive to mosquitoes like that. No matter how low the room\u2019s temperature is, the mosquitoes will still come here to feast on my blood!!\u201dFu Jinxiao was firm on his decision to not spoil him, \u201cI can\u2019t give you my repellent spray. Just turn the temperature down, sleep while being covered fully by the quilt, and endure.\u201dShen Xingchen\u2019s face was full of reluctance.Shen Xingsui next to him said in a gentle voice, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just bear with it and it\u2019ll pass.\u201dSuddenly, Shen Xingchen had an idea, \u201cSuisui, do you have a mosquito net?\u201dShen Xingsui was taken aback.\u201cThen let\u2019s sleep together.\u201d Shen Xingchen hugged him directly without a shame, entangling his arms around his brother\u2019s, \u201cIsn\u2019t this just right? Both you and I will not get bitten at all! Plus, it\u2019s been a long time since we had a sleepover!\u201dActor Fu, who was about to leave, halted on his tracks.1a more\u2026 soft?

He kept recklessly talking to Shen Xingsui, \u201cOhh, I have an idea. We\u2019ll ask Ning Ze to join us, how about it? It\u2019s time for the three of us to continue being roommates!\u201dShen Xingsui hesitated for a moment.It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t want to, it\u2019s just that he thought it might be too cramped \u2013 the beds were all single beds, and it would be uncomfortable for three big men to sleep on it. Besides, their room was designed to be a single-person room, and he was afraid the program crew might disallow any rooming between the guests.Just as he was about to turn Shen Xingchen down and just gave him his mosquito net, a certain domineering Movie Emperor spoke first.Leaning against the door with a mysterious smile on his face, Fu Jinxiao called out, \u201cShen Xingchen.\u201dShen Xingchen was caught unaware,\u201dHuh?\u201dFu Jinxiao chastised him with some kind of\u2026 indescribable tone, \u201cIf you howl any more, the heat on your body will increase. Mosquitoes are more likely to find you. That\u2019s why you\u2019d better shut up now or face the consequences.\u201dShen Xingsui thought that the actor\u2019s smile had a sinister edge to it.Shen Xingchen, however, didn\u2019t catch the actor\u2019s hostility. He just nodded along with what Fu Jinxiao said at face-value. He decisively let go of Shen Xingsui.Fu Jinxiao continued, \u201cHow can he sleep on you in a single bed?\u201dShen Xingchen reacted slowly, finally realizing something.\u201cTake it.\u201d Fu Jinxiao threw a small bottle to Shen Xingchen, \u201cMosquito repellent spray, sleep after applying it.\u201dAfter taking it, Shen Xingchen said curiously: \u201cFu-ge, didn\u2019t you say you only have a small bottle? Why is there any extra?\u201dUnder the light, Actor Fu\u2019s complexion was elegant. With the usual kind smile on his face, he replied, \u201cReally? Maybe I misremembered.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast room watched this going down happily:[Hahahaha he successfully convinced Shen Xingchen!][The moment he heard they will sleep together, Mister Fu immediately turned around.][Sisters, I suddenly want to ship them.][I agree, I agree! Fu-ge is really sweet towards Suisui!][I am a fan of Fu-ge. I have never watched variety shows before because he rarely appears on them. Today I really have a feast~]The night was getting late. Just when everyone was going to sleep, the director team sent a wooden box to each guest\u2019s room.Shen Xingsui was also very surprised when he got the box, but he dutifully carried the box on the table and opened it. There was a card inside that said:[Greetings, young heroes who came to this mansion. With a heavy heart, we must inform you that the Prince\u2019s private visit has been leaked to the assassins. As one of the Prince\u2019s envoys, you must catch these assassins lurking amongst you. If the traitors aren\u2019t found within five days, the Prince\u2019s life may be forfeit. Please find out the truth and catch them.]Shen Xingsui didn\u2019t expect \u201cBright Stars\u201d to have such a plot!His role was printed on another card. Shen Xingsui picked it up hesitantly, and found that the card read:[Your identity is\u2014the Prince. Please protect yourself from being approached by the assassins, and help your teammates to identify the assassins.]Shen Xingsui: \u201c?\u201dHe actually got the identity of the \u201cPrince\u201d?There were a total of ten guests in this program group. Since the card kept mentioning multiple assassins, there must be two assassins \u2013 as three assassins would be too many for a group with ten members. Excluding himself and the two traitors, there were seven people who should be on his side.He needed to be clever in finding his teammates, making sure none of them were actually the traitor. If he just recklessly revealed his identity, he might become the target of the assassins. So he had to wait and see what happened tomorrow.The cameraman was next to him and took a picture of Shen Xingsui\u2019s ID card. Netizens were very excited:[My God, the little bunny is the prince!][I thought Brother Fu would get this identity.][Hahaha, I just came back from another live broadcast room and found that Actor Fu got the \u201cPrince\u2019s Guard\u201d identity.]At the same time, all the guests got the boxes\u2013Shen Xingchen complained about the identity he got, \u201cI\u2019m just a mere guard?? I refuse! I want to be the assassin. How cool is that?!\u201dCameraman: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe had never been so speechless in his life.The other guests also got their identity cards.The viewers could only see a few of them, as some of the guests were quite sneaky and hid it from the camera.[Both Xingchen and Fu-ge got the guard identity.][Suisui is the Prince.][It\u2019s confirmed that Tuya and Instructor Li are also guards.][Feng Fan is also a guard!][Xu Qinke just opened his, he\u2019s also another guard.]So far, the netizens have ruled out six people1I changed quite a lot in this passage bc the author fucked this up quite a bit. They originally write there are \u201ceight guests\u201d but if you count them all up, it should be ten. The author also forgot to write Instructor Li\u2019s identity, but seeing he\u2019s not amongst the three sussy people, he should be a guard. as guards. A lot of them didn\u2019t think there would be multiple assassins, so the consensus was there should be the assassin between the remaining three people: Anran, Li Xu\u2019an, and Ning Ze. There were heated debates on who was the assassin, but no answer was reached.The next day, at five o\u2019clock in the morning\u2013Shen Xingsui was still asleep, but woke up rather unceremoniously.The staff of the program group woke him up, \u201cSuisui, wake up.\u201dThe cameraman was still following behind. Shen Xingsui was bleary when he woke up. The cameraman wasn\u2019t informed, so he was also confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe director came over and said, \u201cBecause you and Fu-ge didn\u2019t complete your extra mission yesterday, you will be punished this morning.\u201dShen Xingsui couldn\u2019t remember anything about the extra mission. So this must be bullshit the crew cooked. The director probably just wanted to spice things up. Since he was the winner yesterday, and therefore hadn\u2019t clowned himself enough in front of the camera, he was the unlucky person who got this punishment.The youth rubbed his eyes, and obediently asked, \u201cWhat kind of punishment?\u201d\u201cThe task is to wake up every guest.\u201dShen Xingsui was shocked, \u201cBy my own?\u201dThe director nodded with a shit-eating grin, \u201cYes, and we have to go now. As for the way to wake them up, we opened a WeChat account last night and let the audience vote. And the mighty lord audience has spoken, the method for waking them up today is\u2014\u201dShen Xingsui saw that he stopped talking, and leaned over curiously, \u201cWhat is it?The director was showing off the screen of his phone. After getting closer, Shen Xingsui could fully see the words on the screen: [Give a good morning kiss to wake them up.]\u201c\u2026\u201dThe silence was deafening.Shen Xingsui looked at the number of votes \u2013 10 million. With clear doubts in his eyes, he asked, \u201cIs this really what the audience wants to see the most?\u201dNetizens in the live broadcast room:[Hahaha, don\u2019t doubt the vote~][We really want to watch this!][I can\u2019t wait, I can\u2019t wait!!!]Shen Xingsui felt his head was getting heavier, but the director was still urging him heartlessly, \u201cSuisui, hurry up and start from the room closest to you.\u201d\u201cShen Xingchen?\u201dThe director\u2019s schadenfreude was clear, \u201cNope! It\u2019s Fu-ge\u2019s room~\u201dShen Xingsui\u2019s eyes widened, and he froze in place. Asking him to kiss his idol in the early morning for no reason?? Wouldn\u2019t this kind of behavior be hated? Will he be beaten?But the director happily sing-songed, \u201cSuisui, Fu-ge is a bit grumpy in the morning. Prepare your mentality~\u201dAnyway, their program crew didn\u2019t dare to call that Lord Yan2the King of Hell. Equivalent to Japanese mythos\u2019 Lord Enma or Hindu mythos\u2019 Lord Yama. to get up, so they could only use this method to wake him up. There was once a guest of a certain variety show who was punished for waking Actor Fu up, and the said actor only had a few hours of sleep. The guest met a tragic end, and the staff said that they had a psychological shadow afterward.The director patted Shen Xingsui on the shoulder pitifully: \u201cCome on, we are optimistic about you.\u201dShen Xingsui: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis was just sending lambs to slaughter!1I changed quite a lot in this passage bc the author fucked this up quite a bit. They originally write there are \u201ceight guests\u201d but if you count them all up, it should be ten.

You aren\u2019t walled by a paywall to read this, and nobody\u2019s forcing you. That means your unsolicited negative rant/hatred isn\u2019t welcome hereIt\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t want to kiss the older man. It\u2019s because he was afraid to be annoying and rude. It was hard enough to forge this current relationship with Fu Jinxiao. If a junior behaved this way, wouldn\u2019t that be counted as disrespectful? He didn\u2019t want to destroy this relationship he managed to make.If he was hated, he would be sad and want to cry.The director was still happily urging the small bunny into the wolf\u2019s den, \u201cSuisui, don\u2019t waste time. Go quickly \u2013 if you go early, you will return early.\u201dThese words sounded more like: \u201cif you die early, you will be reborn early\u201d instead.Shen Xingsui had no choice. Since he was a guest on this show, he couldn\u2019t be too pretentious. He put on his clothes, washed up briefly, and then went out.It was about dawn time.The sky outside was foggy, as this small town was close to the mountains. On the faraway horizon, green\u00a0 mountains were winding into a line. The peak was surrounded by heavy clouds, masking it in a hazy mystery. The mansion itself was very quiet, its inhabitants were still in deep slumber. Only a few chirps from songbirds in the garden could be heard, giving the building a sense of peaceful tranquility.The director urged again in a whisper, \u201cGo quickly.\u201dShen Xingsui then turned his gaze to the door in front of him. He took a deep breath under the morning light, and then walked slowly to the inside of Fu Jinxiao\u2019s room.Netizens in the live broadcast room were anxiously waiting:[I can tell from Suisui\u2019s expression that he is walking to his death.][I\u2019m Fu-ge\u2019s fan. I was a little jealous at first, but seeing his expression now, I can only just laugh.][I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a little sad, but it\u2019s so funny.][My baby Suisui is so cuteThe cameraman poked him quietly again, silently mouthing, \u201cHurry up.\u201dNetizens in the live broadcast room\u2019s impatience skyrocketed, scratching their hearts and lungs:[OH MY GOD IT\u2019S HAPPENING][I\u2019m panicking! I can\u2019t see this, but I want to see!!][Ahh ahhh!!! I want to be in Suisui\u2019s place QAQ][Suisui, can you do it?]When everyone was getting angry, Shen Xingsui, who had always been nervous and timid, finally acted.Shen Xingsui leaned against the edge of the bed and bent down slightly. He looked down at Fu Jinxiao, his eyes were so peaceful and focused, as gentle as a clear moon, and his movements were light and slow.\u00a0 Because he was directly facing Fu Jinxiao, the distance between their lips was also very close.For some reason, the cameraman\u2019s hands were sweating.If Shen Xingsui was willing, under such circumstances, he could just kiss the actor directly. There were legitimate reasons, the right timing, and the opportunity to realize his dream.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe room was silent.After a while\u2013Shen Xingsui leaned forward a little, piously and sincerely, like a believer kneeling down to a god. He placed a light kiss on Fu Jinxiao\u2019s forehead, like a superficial touch, as light as a brush of feather on your face. It was full of unspoken meaning.However, just when Shen Xingsui wanted to get away after kissing, the sleeping man suddenly opened his eyes.\u00a0 There was no trace of sleepiness in those deep dark eyes. With efficient movement, he grabbed Shen Xingsui by the arm and yanked him down. The youth panicked as he felt his world turned upside-down, but he couldn\u2019t react in time.In the end, he also fell unceremoniously beside Fu Jinxiao on the bed. Thankfully, he fell on top of the quilt, so it wasn\u2019t too awkward.Fu Jinxiao looked at him with an indescribable look. The man who had just woken up said in a deep, hoarse, and ears-numbing voice, \u201cGood morning.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShen Xingsui\u2019s face was flushed.It was obviously someone else he secretly kissed, but he blushed as if there was nothing unusual. With a blush and a stammer, he replied, \u201cMorning, good morning.\u201d\u201cSuch an elegant greeting, Comrade Little Shen,\u201d Fu Jinxiao\u2019s handsome face was too close. With one glance at those half-lidded eyes, Shen Xingsui felt his heart jump out of his ribcage. It was too attractive, it felt sinful.With a teasing voice, Fu Jinxiao asked, \u201cI got up early in the morning, what are you doing here?\u201dShen Xingsui was embarrassed and thought, \u2018What, you don\u2019t know what I did?? Liar!\u2019But Fu Jinxiao looked at him so leisurely, and Shen Xingsui didn\u2019t dare to be dishonest with his look of waiting for an answer, so he hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2019m doing the task assigned to me by the program group.\u201dFu Jinxiao, \u201cOh?\u201dShen Xingsui hastily confessed about the director\u2019s dastardly task, \u201cThey\u2026 uh, they made me wake you up with a good morning kiss.\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, his meaning unclear.Shen Xingsui thought he was angry, and quickly said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Instructor Fu, I didn\u2019t mean it!\u201dFu Jinxiao said, \u201cSo you really kissed me while I was sleeping?\u201dShen Xingsui nodded obediently, but when he found that Fu Jinxiao was still looking at him, he quickly added: \u201cI, I didn\u2019t do other things improperly. I kissed where I shouldn\u2019t, so I just kissed it. Your forehead, don\u2019t be angry!\u201dFu Jinxiao continued to stare at him, making Shen Xingsui even more nervous. His Adam\u2019s apple rolled up and down.\u201cTsk\u2026\u201d Fu Jinxiao sighed lightly, and poked Shen Xingsui\u2019s head with his slender and fair fingers, his voice was low and seemed to be somewhat helpless, \u201cCoward.\u201dShen Xingsui was taken aback, \u201cHuh?\u201dFu Jinxiao got up as if he had given up teasing him, \u201cDon\u2019t you need to wake others up?\u201dShen Xingsui finally realized: \u201cYes, yes.\u201dWhen he thought of calling someone else to wake up and give him a good morning kiss, Shen Xingsui felt that this was the real torture, the real moment of death.Shen Xingsui sighed heavily.Fu Jinxiao sat up next to him then took a drink from the cup by the table. The man who just woke up looked dangerous for some reason \u2013his nightgown was loose and he squinted at him, \u201cWhy, don\u2019t you want to go?\u201dShen Xingsui with a bitter face, \u201cThis is a punishment task, because we took a shortcut yesterday, so we have to wake everyone up.\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, and his eyes fell on the cameraman next to him. The smile on the corner of his mouth seemed very shallow, and his voice gentle but it sounded inexplicably dangerous: \u201cIs this the case?\u201dThe cameraman felt the hidden knife behind that smile, but he could only nod.Fu Jinxiao looked very reasonable and gentle, \u201cThe director\u2019s arrangement is also reasonable, of course we have to follow it.\u201dThe director not far away also felt a sudden chill down his spine.Fu Jinxiao smiled more kindly, and said to Shen Xingsui beside him, \u201cIn this case, go quickly, don\u2019t waste time.\u201dShen Xingsui also knew that it was not good to drag things for too long. So he went out to Shen Xingchen\u2019s room next. Although he was his own older brother, the young master\u2019s sleep was notoriously hard to disturb. Despite his effort on kissing him, Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t budge. It\u2019s only after he shook the older man, he got a whine in response. Shen Xingchen finally woke up.Suddenly, the air conditioner stopped.The lights in the room were also off.The temperature rose rapidly, and the room began to heat up.Just when Shen Xingsui was about to wake other people to perform his own social death, he saw that the doors and windows of other rooms were opened. All of them woke up early without any need of a \u201cloving alarm\u201d.Ning Ze asked, clearly just woken up, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, the power went out?\u201d\u201cI slept soundly and woke up from the heat.\u201d Li Xu\u2019an also came out of his room, \u201cWhere is the breaker? Is there something wrong?\u201dShen Xingsui himself was also shocked stupid.Everyone was curious what\u2019s going on. Without anyone noticing, Fu Jinxiao also came out of a hidden corner slowly. The actor had been fully dressed and presentable. He leaned against the edge of the corridor and said to everyone in good spirits, \u201cMorning.\u201dThe others greeted him back.The stupid Shen Xingchen said without thinking, \u201cThen, there\u2019s no task now, right? I\u2019m so sleepy, I want to go back to sleep.\u201dEveryone else nodded in agreement.The director originally wanted to have a program like a good morning kiss, but he didn\u2019t expect that the electricity in the guest room would be cut off. As for who did this, he didn\u2019t dare to ask, and he didn\u2019t dare to say.If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Enjoy this bonus chapter~Ko-fi donation goals to the next bonus chapter (0/2)Fortunately for the director, the \u201cmorning kiss\u201d punishment game was popular enough with the viewers, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal to directly move to the next agenda.\u201cGood morning everyone, we are going to get up earlier today. Everyone must have received the mission card last night, right?\u201dOne sentence made everyone who was a little sleepy instantly refreshed.Suddenly, everyone cast suspicion on every gaze they met.Shen Xingchen was the first to say his piece, \u201cI am a good person. I\u2019m the prince\u2019s royal guard. Anyway, the assassin should give up now. Maybe if you\u2019re honest enough, the prince will spare your life.\u201dEveryone else smiled and replied:\u201cAh, what a coincidence, I am also a guard.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m a good person.\u201dAnran instead asked, \u201cWho is the prince? We will focus on protecting him from now on, so it\u2019s easier for us to know their identity.\u201dBefore Shen Xingsui could speak, Actor Fu beside him took a cold look at Anran, and opened his lips, \u201cAh, you mean, so it\u2019s to make it easier for the assassin to kill the prince?\u201dThey still didn\u2019t know a key detail of the assassin \u2013 the method they use for \u201ckilling\u201d. Besides, nobody said that an assassin can\u2019t kill a guard, right?Anran choked on pure air, and smiled embarrassingly, \u201cWe have more good people, are you afraid that we won\u2019t be able to protect the prince?\u201d \u201c\u201cWho told you that there is only one assassin?\u201d Fu Jinxiao\u2019s way of thinking was quite terrifying, \u201cIs the number mentioned anywhere on the mission card?\u201dAfter finishing the sentence, the surroundings were silent.The word \u201cassassin\u201d appeared in the narrative of the mission card yesterday. Most people subconsciously thought that there was only one assassin. But Fu Jinxiao was right, as long as there was no actual confirmation, who said that there could only be one assassin?Netizens in the live broadcast room also expressed their surprise:[I knew it!!][Fu Jinxiao\u2019s brain is terrifying.][I finally know why he wasn\u2019t allowed to take the assassin identity.][True, true, in that way, nobody would survive!][The director is so far-sighted!]Currently, everyone was silent, having their own thoughts. To continue the show\u2019s narrative, the director nudged them, \u201cActually, we still have a lot of good people here. And as for the next mission, anyone who completes their mission will get a hint card. Each of them will give a bit of description to help you guess the assassin\u2019s identity. Furthermore, as long as everyone deciphers the hint and finds them, the prince\u2019s side will automatically win.\u201dThen, the director gave today\u2019s mission, \u201cWe stayed at this gorgeous villa last night, and the payment is actually a loan given by the locals. So today, everyone is required to pay off their loans! You can go look for a job, and you need to buy your own meals and clothes! As for the villa\u2019s rent, you need to pay off 1,000 yuan1about 145 USD before dusk today! Of course, the person who earns the most money today is considered the winner and is eligible to get a hint card.\u201dMake that much money on the first day?Everyone was quite surprised, but they also had more fighting spirit and vigor after hearing that they could win the hint cards.After the director assigned the task, he said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s start the day!\u201dTuya found a key point from the director\u2019s speech, \u201cDirector, where is our breakfast?\u201cYou are all mature adults, you can solve it by yourself. You all should learn to be self-reliant, tsk tsk tsk\u2026 of course, if you really don\u2019t have anything to eat, we have prepared large pancakes2he actually said \u997c \u201cb\u01d0ng\u201d, which is a thin pancake that is very versatile, you can pair/stuff it with anything basically. But only eating the pancake/bread by itself is kinda\u2026 pitiful.. This will count as a\u2026 loan of sorts as well.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201dWell, thank you very much.The audience in the live broadcast room was laughing at their misery:[The director can really spit out some doggy words.][Hahaha, working while hungry.][I\u2019ll give a medal to whoever\u2019s evil enough to think of this mission.]Fortunately, there was still readily-available breakfast. While some people could work without breakfast, some others weren\u2019t used to this.Anran came out of his room at this time and said with a smile, \u201cAre you hungry? I happen to have some biscuits and pastries that I baked myself. If you don\u2019t mind, eat them!\u201dThis move was a lifesaver.After listening, everyone of course gave up the big pancake in their hands and went to eat pastries instead.Shen Xingsui didn\u2019t go, he continued to eat the pancakes. But Anran came over by himself, took a pastry and handed it to Shen Xingsui, saying, \u201cSuisui, would you like to eat some too?\u201dShen Xingsui politely refused, \u201cI\u2019m fine with these pancakes. Thank you for the offering, though.\u201dAnran frowned as he looked at Shen Xingsui with a hint of grievance. He softly persuaded, \u201cSuisui, I\u2019ve been baking cakes for a long time. And you see Instructor Tuya and the others ate them all. Why not give it a try? I just want to share it with you.\u201dShen Xingsui really didn\u2019t want to eat Anran\u2019s baked goods. The more Anran pushed him, the more scared he became.But Anran didn\u2019t seem to be able to see his rejection, and insisted on standing beside Shen Xingsui with a pastry, as if it was exhausting to the end.Netizens also said:[It\u2019s just a piece of pastry, why are you rejecting his kindness?][Ranran is so kind\u2026][Shen Xingsui is too difficult to get along with.]Anran\u2019s persistence wore Shen Xingsui off. He picked up a piece of pastry and said, \u201cThank you.\u201dShen Xingchen who was next to him was also given a piece. In fact, this pastry tasted very soft and delicious, and most people wouldn\u2019t find anything wrong with it. But Shen Xingchen was different from others. The young master has been eating various delicacies from mountains and seas since he was a child, and he has developed sensitive taste buds. He could distinguish the ingredients of almost every food he ate.Shen Xingchen took a bite and grumbled, \u201cWhy does it smell like seaweed?\u201dAnran froze and smiled awkwardly, \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d\u201cReally.\u201d Shen Xingchen glared at him, \u201cWhat, do you think I would lie to splash dirty water on you?\u201dAnran didn\u2019t expect to be countered, and immediately gave up, \u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t mean that! But I really didn\u2019t put in seaweed. This is just a normal savory pastry, I didn\u2019t put any unusual ingredients in it.\u201dOnly then did Shen Xingchen give up, \u201cReally? Okay, then.\u201dShen Xingsui froze after hearing this.He was very allergic to seaweed. He would get itchy rashes all over his body if he ingested a miniscule of it.Shouldn\u2019t Anran know about this? Then, does this pastry contain seaweed? If so, why did Anran do this? Shen Xingsui just felt a chill down his spine.But soon, everyone left the house after eating.Everyone had to split up and prepare to start making money to pay off their loan. When they went out, they saw a stray dog. It looked friendly, and unbothered by strangers as it squatted there. However, looking at its prominent rib cage, it must\u2019ve been hungry for quite a while. It had golden-yellow fur, and it looked like a very good boy. Maybe because it had been a stray for a long time, it was very dirty with grime all over its fur.Anran always appeared like a kind little angel. He pointed at the stray dog and said, \u201cWow, it\u2019s a puppy.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an stopped and commented, \u201cYeah, I think that\u2019s a stray.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so pitiful.\u201d Anran had a face full of sympathy, \u201cIt looks very hungry and hasn\u2019t eaten for a long time.\u201dAfter the dog sensed this group of strangers, it approached them. It was very friendly, and it even wagged its tail. But Anran, who just said that the dog was cute, reflexively flinched as the dog went his way. He didn\u2019t want the dirt and grime to stain his clothes, so he took two steps backward.Shen Xingchen caught this hypocrite and commented, \u201cIf you really feel pity for it, you can make more money and buy it some food.\u201dAnran looked embarrassed again and said, \u201cBut I have no money now, and I don\u2019t have any food with me. And\u2026 when I have the money, it should be already at night. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to find the puppy then.\u201dNetizens also sighed:[Ranran has a really kind heart.][Truly an angel!][Hahaha, don\u2019t think I failed to catch that step back!]At this moment, Shen Xingsui, who was behind his brother, quipped, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, no need to trouble yourself. I\u2019m already full from eating that pancake, so I haven\u2019t had time to eat the pastry you gave me. Since the dog is so pitiful, let\u2019s give the pastry to the dog, how about it?\u201dThat pastry was originally used by Anran to attack Shen Xingsui.After all, if Shen Xingsui doesn\u2019t eat it, the netizens will definitely attack him \u2013 they would say that he\u2019s being too rude in refusing Anran\u2019s hospitality. And if he eats it and his allergies act up, it has nothing to do with him. After all, he doesn\u2019t know Shen Xingsui has an allergy, so he can\u2019t be blamed.Anran never expected that Shen Xingsui would take out the pastry at this time. Plus, he quoted Anran\u2019s own words. If he refused to help the dog again, wouldn\u2019t that make him look bad?Therefore, even though he didn\u2019t want to, Anran still showed a forced smile, \u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s fine.\u201dShen Xingsui knelt down and called to the dog, \u201cDoggy, come here.\u201dThe little yellow dog came wagging its tail as if it could understand human words.Shen Xingsui broke open the pastry carefully and handed it to the dog.But after putting the pastry on the ground, the little yellow dog sniffed it and gave a tentative lick. Then, it walked away as if it was disgusted! The most outrageous thing was that it also ran to the trash can not far away, preferring to dig through the trash to find food!\u201c\u2026\u201dThe air was silent for a moment, and Anran got visibly more embarrassed as the silence marched on.The audience in the live broadcast room were laughing their ass off:[Is this the legendary dog instinct?!][HAHAHAHA that just proves how unpalatable the pastry is to the dog!!][I laughed to death.][Look at Anran\u2019s expression! Hahahahaha!!!!]I\u2019m pretty sure purposefully giving someone their allergen can be counted as a crime (health endangerment??) in some parts of the world, right?If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1about 145 USD2he actually said \u997c \u201cb\u01d0ng\u201d, which is a thin pancake that is very versatile, you can pair/stuff it with anything basically.

Soon, they forgot about it. As they went to the front, they met the staff of the program group, who said to them, \u201cSince everyone is unfamiliar with the people in the town, we have a list of recommended jobs for you. These establishments are currently recruiting part-timers, and if you are interested, you can go there by yourself.\u201dThe list read: [Restaurant, Bookstore, Manor, Street Vendor, Cleaning Service]Everyone stopped and looked at the four places drawn on the list. They all were widely different jobs, but all of them seemed fun.Tuya asked, \u201cI would like to ask, is this something we can choose?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d The staff decisively answered, \u201cIt\u2019s decided by a lottery. It\u2019s because we want to impart the wisdom of life to you: society is a mysterious thing, not something you can just choose. Follow the guidance of fate.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe program staff just drew another level of aggro1game terminology; it means a person who gets hatred value, so they will be targeted. from the guests.Shen Xingchen rolled up his sleeves and said, \u201cLuck is luck, I can do whatever fate throws at me anyway.\u201dHe was the first to take the lead in drawing lots. The part-time job he got was as a street vendor. Naturally, other guests soon followed suit. They all queued up nicely to wait for their turn, and everyone spread out the results they had drawn.Shen Xingsui unfolded his lots and said softly, \u201cI got the restaurant.\u201dEveryone glanced at each other and guessed which of the other guests got the same.Not far away, Fu Jinxiao held up his results with his slender fingers, and said in a slow voice, \u201cRestaurant.\u201dGetting a job in a restaurant was nothing special. But if that job means you\u2019ll be paired up with Fu Jinxiao, it suddenly became something to be envied. Shen Xingsui himself couldn\u2019t believe his luck. His eyes couldn\u2019t cover up his joy.The final grouping drawn by lottery:Shen Xingsui & Fu Jinxiao \u2013 restaurantShen Xingchen & Li Xu\u2019an \u2013 street vendorJian Anran & Ning Ze \u2013 manorTuya & Xu Qinke \u2013 bookstoreInstructor Li & Feng Fan \u2013 cleaning serviceShen Xingsui looked at his lottery result. With slight curiosity, he asked nobody in particular, \u201cWhat kind of job will I get in this restaurant?\u201dFu Jinxiao answered nonchalantly, \u201cYou\u2019ll know when you go.\u201dIt was also one of the reasons why the audience likes to watch this show. This show was genuine \u2013 that is, there was no script for the guest or editing from the staff. None of the crew gave any guests preferential treatment. All of them, regardless of their personal wealth or status in the industry, had to suffer the same challenges and pitfalls. If they need to learn the way of the commonfolk, so be it. It was the essence of this reality show.The crew didn\u2019t give them the restaurant\u2019s name, or give them a map.Shen Xingsui looked at his card, \u201cIt didn\u2019t say which restaurant it was, do we need to ask the locals?\u201dFu Jinxiao analyzed, \u201cThere is a peach blossom symbol in the center of the restaurant on this card. Remember, the restaurant we ate at yesterday also has this kind of peach blossom theme. And from what I gathered, there are five such restaurants with this theme. Out of those five, the closest one from here has a sticker that the crew places as a sign of cooperation, so it should be that one. Besides, looking in the perspective of the director, he didn\u2019t want the guests to search like headless chickens and waste time. Making the restaurant closest to us guarantees that even if we didn\u2019t understand the clues given, it\u2019s very likely we would stumble upon this restaurant very early.\u201dShen Xingsui was shocked, and he looked at Actor Fu with admiration in his eyes, \u201cYou noticed that sticker detail yesterday?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s luck. It just happens to catch my eyes.\u201d Fu Jinxiao put away his card, and smiled as he continued, \u201cNow, this should cut quite of our total time. Let us go there immediately.\u201dCompared to the experienced Fu Jinxiao, Shen Xingsui is obviously too green. Too inexperienced.Soon, they arrived at the restaurant. A waiter downstairs was not surprised when he saw two people coming in. He just asked, \u201cAre you two looking for a part-time job?\u201dShen Xingsui nodded.He also had a very good attitude towards them, \u201cThen please come with us.\u201dYesterday they were eating at the biggest restaurant in town, and today they are going to come to work in this humble-yet-elegant restaurant. The road of life was really strange and full of twists and turns.They were taken directly to the back kitchen, which was rather busy here, with chefs cooking and waiters hurriedly taking the orders. The waiter led the guests around this area and came to the innermost place.It was an office of sorts. The waiter introduced them to an old man dressed in a gray coat, \u201cThis is Master Gu Yun, you two will be dispatched by him today.\u201dBoth Shen Xingsui and Fu Jinxiao bowed and saluted to say hello to the old master.Master Gu Yun smiled, took a step forward, and held Shen Xingsui\u2019s hand so that the youth didn\u2019t have to salute: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome.\u201dShen Xingsui didn\u2019t expect this master to be so approachable, so his smile got brighter.Master Gu Yun still held Shen Xingsui\u2019s hand, and even asked with concern: \u201cAre you tired after your journey?\u201dShen Xingsui shook his head, \u201c\u2026not tired.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good.\u201d The old master asked again, \u201cWould you like to take a break?\u201dShen Xingsui was shocked. He didn\u2019t expect the benefits to be so good, but he didn\u2019t dare to take it, so he shook his head quickly: \u201cNo need, I want to work here.\u201dMaster Gu Yun let go of the youth\u2019s hand.From the beginning to the end, the old master was courteous with Actor Fu, but he was very enthusiastic towards Shen Xingsui. This made Shen Xingsui feel that this master looked at him very\u2026 kindly?\u201cToday you two are working here to serve food for customers.\u201d Master Gu Yun said, \u201cFrom cooking, serving dishes, washing dishes\u2026 All of those things have to be done.\u00a0 If there are complaints from customers, your wage will be deducted. \u201cShen Xingsui was already mentally prepared when he came here. With determination in his eyes, he replied with a nod, \u201cUnderstood.\u201dAfter Gu Yun finished speaking, he looked at the youth a few more times, and actually added an extra sentence, \u201cBut if you are too tired, take a rest. Don\u2019t burden your body. If you force yourself too much, I will have a word with you.\u201dShen Xingsui didn\u2019t know how to answer that, so he said, \u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dThe person in charge of this restaurant was really nice.The audience in the live broadcast room also noticed that the treatment here was really good:[What kind of fairy is this boss?][From now on, I\u2019m going to pray everyday for my boss to get this level of conscience.][Hahaha, the group next door are not so lucky.][The cleaning service team is charged to move goods. And they won\u2019t get food if they can\u2019t move enough to fill their quota, hahaha!][Anran and Ning Ze are also cleaning up the muddy lotus pond in the manor.][Tuya-jie and Qin-ge are moving books~]In contrast, the atmosphere and the treatment in the restaurant made it seem like it didn\u2019t belong to the same reality show. It was like heaven and hell.The first job that Shen Xingsui and Fu Jinxiao were assigned was to stir-fry the dishes ordered by a table of guests, and then deliver them to the guests on time within ten minutes.When Shen Xingsui received this task, a look of embarrassment flashed across his face.Fu Jinxiao asked the youth, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not very good at cooking.\u201d Shen Xingsui looked up at Fu Jinxiao, and finally admitted one of his embarrassing secrets, \u201cMy cooking is\u2026 quite unpalatable. It\u2019s passable, but it\u2019s \u00a0 just not fried well. It definitely fails on the restaurant\u2019s standard\u201dThen Shen Xingsui thought, \u2018Actor Fu has never had to worry about food and clothing since he was a child, and he probably doesn\u2019t know how to cook either\u2026 Doesn\u2019t this mean that us two are complete newbies?\u2019But Fu Jinxiao didn\u2019t take it seriously. The man rolled up his sleeves and tied the apron next to him. He moved naturally and skillfully, and ordered, \u201cGo chop the vegetables, and I\u2019ll fry them.\u201dShen Xingsui: \u201c?\u201dHe was shocked until he froze in place. Seeing that he didn\u2019t move, Fu Jinxiao asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201cNothing! I\u2019m going now!\u201dThe youth almost gave the Actor a martial arts salute.This serious little appearance made people laugh, especially since Shen Xingsui immediately bolted out from the stove area to the cutting board to start working. It looked simple and genuinely hilarious.The netizens were also delighted:[To be honest, I\u2019m going to stan Shen Xingsui.][A very simple and serious baby~][I feel that he is very much like us ordinary people, working hard in life.][Every time I see him, I suddenly want to work harder!]The customer ordered hot and sour shredded potatoes, fried pork with green peppers, and a bowl of tomato and egg soup combo that included a stir-fried pork liver with green onions. After peeling the potatoes, Shen Xingsui couldn\u2019t help but to comment after seeing Fu Jinxiao\u2019s proficient stir-frying and seasonings, \u201cIt smells so good.\u201dFu Jinxiao glanced at him with the corner of his eyes, and curled his lips into a smile, \u201cDo you want to try it?\u201dShen Xingsui still had this sense of propriety, \u201cNo, no, this is for the customers.\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right,\u201d Fu Jinxiao then put the dish on a plate. It wasn\u2019t anything fancy or artful, but it looked very appetizing. With a whisper, he said as if he was telling a secret, \u201cIf you want to eat, then do it next time.\u201dNext time?What does this mean?Will he cook for Shen Xingsui next time?\u2018Impossible, impossible, this is my idol. It\u2019s probably my idol-filter making it a wish fulfillment. How could he cook for an ordinary person like myself? It was probably just a casual joke.\u2019Fu Jinxiao ordered him, \u201cTake this over.\u201dShen Xingsui came back to his senses and nodded quickly, \u201cGot it!\u201dHe quickly ran over to the customers with the dishes, and when he came back, he saw Fu Jinxiao already preparing to cook for another dish. In panic, Shen Xingsui rushed over when he saw Actor Fu holding an onion, \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201dHis body reacted faster than his brain.When he came to his senses, the onion was already in his hands.The robbed Fu Jinxiao looked at him in surprise, and when he saw Shen Xingsui\u2019s reddish cheeks and worried eyes, he smiled softly, with a gentle and helpless voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush, no one is competing with you for work.\u201dShen Xingsui shook his head and explained, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant, it\u2019s just onions\u2026 and uh\u2026 making your eyes teary\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao\u2019s teasing smile subsided slightly.Shen Xingsui lowered his head, and his voice became quieter and quieter. In this noisy and messy kitchen, his whispered words still reached Fu Jinxiao\u2019s ears clearly, \u201cYour eyes have old injuries, and they will be uncomfortable. \u201cThe youth lowered his head, not noticing that Fu Jinxiao\u2019s gaze at him was gradually deepening. His casual expression becoming more\u2026 indescribable. It\u2019s as if he was thinking about something.Shen Xingsui, however, was afraid of delaying the order of the customers, so he went over to chop the vegetables before he could react. The audience only heard half of what he said, but they could guess most of it based on Actor Fu expression:[Suisui is probably not an angel, is he?][This is too wild, isn\u2019t he just clinging to the powerful?][Upstairs2commenter before, your heart is too dark. Fu-ge usually treats him so well. Do you think that Suisui still needs to lick his shoes?][And Suisui rushed up immediately when he saw the onions. He definitely didn\u2019t plan that. It should be pure reflex.]When Shen Xingsui was chopping vegetables, Master Gu Yun appeared again. He saw the youth chopping onions, it made him distressed. He wanted to find goggles3The chemical in onions that makes you cry is syn-propanethial-S-oxide. It stimulates the eyes\u2019 lachrymal glands so they release tears (I think because it\u2019s a particularly volatile(easily turned into gas) irritant.) It actually can affect you not only from your eyes, but through your nose. for Shen Xingsui.Shen Xingsui was very grateful that it should be over soon. The last dish was tomato and egg soup. The soup was served in a bowl.\u00a0 As Shen Xingsui went to serve it, the high heat made the ceramic bowl very hot, and he flinched just by stretching his hand over it.Fu Jinxiao quickly put down the bowl and spoon and came over to check, \u201cIs it hot?\u201dShen Xingsui denied it quickly, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not very hot.\u201dBut his fair hands have already turned red. Even so, he wouldn\u2019t act coquettishly to win sympathy. Instead, he immediately introspected himself \u2013 it was definitely his fault, he was too rushed just now. With an apologetic smile, he said, \u201cI was too reckless, I shouldn\u2019t have done it without testing the temperature first. It would be bad if I smashed the customer\u2019s soup.\u201dLooking up, he met Fu Jinxiao\u2019s sharp eyes.Shen Xingsui\u2019s heart trembled, Actor Fu raised his eyelids and looked at him with a bit of seriousness, which made his smile stop abruptly.\u201cIf you smash it, then just let it be, accidents happen. I\u2019ll just cook another bowl.\u201d Fu Jinxiao had an indifferent tone, as if he had completely forgotten that it was not easy to cook this bowl of soup. After checking that everything was fine, the actor let him go, but he still knocked Shen Xingsui punitively. There was still a faint smile on his handsome face, but it was different from before. The smile on the corner of his mouth felt oddly dangerous, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this next time. If you say such words again, I will be angry.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a serious danger, but that smile made him feel tense and uncomfortable.The actor didn\u2019t emphasize this too much. But, from the tone alone, it told Shen Xingsui that Fu Jinxiao\u2019s actual wrath would be very, very scary. He could predict that without seeing the actor actually angry.But\u2026Why?Was it because he implied that the soup was more important than scalding his hand?But when he was with Jian\u2019s family before, if he accidentally did something wrong, like accidentally breaking a bowl, everyone would be very angry at him. What greeted him would be harsh stares and reproaches:\u201cCan\u2019t you do this well?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s such a disappointment to come back for dinner and see such a mess.\u201dThose words have been repeated to him multiple times. Each time, it drove the stake in his heart deeper and deeper. With time, his subconscious would brace himself for the scolding he would get if he made a mistake. He always had to walk on egg-shells and contradict himself \u2013 he wanted to be loved, so he would do anything to please them. But at times, the lack of love he was given made him act up. It was a vicious cycle he couldn\u2019t escape from.But this time, he didn\u2019t get a scolding.The first reaction of this\u2026 half-stranger in front of him was\u2026 he was concerned about whether he was injured. He didn\u2019t care about the bowl. He understood that it was an accident and didn\u2019t blame him.\u201c\u2026\u201dThis feeling is really strange, and even made Shen Xingsui choke for a moment.Translator's comment on the Shen famHonestly, I think the author handles the situation with Suisui and the Shen fam (esp his mom) well. Their trauma didn\u2019t just\u2026 magically cured after their reunion. The aftermath was there, scaring them all in different ways. Suisui\u2019s subconscious makes him think of the worst conclusion everytime he makes a mistake, and his self-worth is very low. Shen Minglang and Shen Yong overcompensate their love with the language they understand the most \u2013 money. Shen Xingchen is the most unscathed, mostly because he didn\u2019t remember the younger brother he was supposed to have most of the time. But he still pampers Shen Xingsui. Xu Enzhen\u2026 well, everytime she appears on screen, she would either: make sure Shen Xingsui is comfortable, or, holding his hand. I think she wanted to make sure her supposed-dead baby was actually alive. She had a lot to unpack.It will take a long, long, long time for them to heal. Because everything had been buried deep, it needs a lot of time to uproot all of that.If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1game terminology; it means a person who gets hatred value, so they will be targeted.2commenter before3The chemical in onions that makes you cry is syn-propanethial-S-oxide.

Is it ready yet? Send it over soon.\u201dAfter preparing a full-course meal, Fu Jinxiao commented under Shen Xingsui\u2019s indescribable gaze, \u201cThis is the first time I cook for the guests, and this should be the last meal. Let\u2019s meet them and ask how it tastes.\u201dShen Xingsui only nodded and he followed suit.The guests at Table 3 knew that there was a celebrity here, but when they saw Fu Jinxiao, they almost screamed uncontrollably!Fu Jinxiao put down the soup, with a celebrity smile on his face, \u201cHow is the food? Does it taste good?\u201dThe guest immediately nodded his head, \u201cIt\u2019s very delicious! Fu-ge, the dishes you cook are really delicious. I didn\u2019t expect you can also cook this good. Oh my god, am I really eating your dishes? I will definitely have to pack them back for my family to taste. We are all your fans. I- I have seen many of your works. They are all stellar! I love them.\u201dFu Jinxiao listened very politely, neither humble nor overbearing: \u201cThank you for your support of my work. This is not a waste of my labor.\u201d\u201cNo need to thank us!\u201d The guest wanted to be with Fu Jinxiao very much. He proposed something to get closer to the actor, \u201cHave you eaten yet? How about you sit down and eat together?\u201dFu Jinxiao shook his head, \u201cThank you for your kindness, but I have to decline. We will be busy with other work in a while. This is an arrangement from the program crew and the restaurant staff. I can\u2019t just slack off at my job.\u201dThe customer was in a dilemma: \u201cWhat should I do then\u2026? Oh, how about I give you extra tips\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao smiled again. When the customer was stared by those affectionate phoenix eyes, his heart started to beat uncontrollably.The actor seemed to know this. With a deep and magnetic voice, he purposely slowly said, \u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary, as long as you enjoy your meal, you don\u2019t need to give me tips. We\u2019re just cooking as chefs today.\u201dThe customer didn\u2019t back down. He quickly took out money from his wallet, and forced it over, \u201cYou must accept this.\u201dFu Jinxiao leisurely said, \u201cWhy, though?\u201dWith an enthusiastic voice, the customer kept insisting, \u201cYou deserve it!\u201dFu Jinxiao reluctantly accepted it, but still very conscientiously cooperated with the customer to take photos and give autographs. After giving benefits, he left the customer.Shen Xingsui was dumbfounded.Fu Jinxiao handed him the tips with a casual gesture, \u201cTake it.\u201dShen Xingsui accepted the 300 yuan1about 44 USD, and the smile on his face couldn\u2019t stop, \u201cTeacher Fu, you are too good! Can you accept tips?\u201d\u201cOtherwise?\u201d Fu Jinxiao glanced backwards as he stepped upstairs, \u201cOur room fee adds up to 2,000 yuan. After deducting this part, the extra wages earned can be counted as today\u2019s competition content. It\u2019s already eleven o\u2019clock. It\u2019s up to us to decide on our way to make money. Do you think we will get enough just by cooking and serving meals?\u201dShen Xingsui nodded, he looked like he was enlightened. \u201cIt makes sense.\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast room laughed loudly:[It\u2019s over, this kid is going to be spoiled by Fu-ge.][I knew that as soon as Fu-ge came out, he would do something else! It couldn\u2019t be just as simple as \u2018asking the food\u2019s taste\u2019][Hahaha, an old fox is an old fox.][Your Fu-ge is still your Fu-ge.]When the two returned to the back kitchen, they suddenly received a sudden message from the director team, \u201cGuests, please pay attention. In your working space, there may be clues about the assassin\u2019s identity and other things. Please search for them while you are working. Carefully observe your surroundings and find these hidden clues.\u201dShen Xingsui thought after hearing the reminder, \u201cThere may be clues about the assassins in our restaurant.\u201dFu Jinxiao responded lightly, \u201cIt should be hidden somewhere.\u201dThe restaurant was too big, and it\u2019s not easy to search for it inch by inch, especially because there were so many people in the back kitchen. Searching for it without a direction would take too much time.Just as he was deep in thought, Shen Xingsui\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cI know where it is hidden!\u201dFu Jinxiao looked at him in surprise.Shen Xingsui ran out of the back kitchen in an instant. He arrived at a corner on the second floor, where there was a huge peach blossom logo, which was custom-made by the merchant. He felt the texture of the carved logo with his fingertips and sure enough, he felt a significant textural difference. Out of that, he took out a small box. With a smile, he triumphantly said, \u201cIt\u2019s really here.\u201dFu Jinxiao didn\u2019t expect the youth to find a hidden clue this fast. He wondered, \u201cHow did you think of it?\u201d\u201cWell, because during one of my deliveries, I met Master Gu Yun.\u201d Shen Xingsui was very excited as he recounted the event, \u201cMaster told me that although the logo of the peach blossom tree is beautiful, the back is hollowed out, so he reminded me to not get too close. Now that I think about it, that was a very suspicious hint. I\u2019m very lucky, don\u2019t you think?\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows and smiled, \u201cMhmm, I agree.\u201dShen Xingsui nodded enthusiastically, \u201cYeah!\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast room also sighed:[Stupid people have stupid luck.][So lucky!][This Master Gu Yun really likes him, hahaha.]What Shen Xingsui didn\u2019t pay attention to was that Chef Gu Yun, who everyone commented to be kindhearted, was actually someone not to be messed with. Even the actual owner of the restaurant had to be careful not to slight him whenever they interact.The old chef was currently leisurely drinking tea, and was on the phone with his wife. The old chef, Shen Guyun, said with a fond tone to his phone, \u201cMy wife2\u8001\u5a46\u5b50\u201cl\u01ceop\u00f3zi\u201d, laopo is a casual way of saying \u201cwife\u201d. It can be translated as \u201cwifey\u201d or \u201cwaifu\u201d lol. -zi can be used as a suffix for someone younger that you are close to., I finally saw our grandson with my eyes!\u201dThe grandmother on the other end of the phone was also very excited, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for my legs, I would have gone to accompany you to meet him. That child is really cute.\u201dShen Guyun nodded, his eyes were bright, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right! I observed him today, and his future husband is also very good. He\u2019s the eldest son of the Fu family, isn\u2019t he? He was very respectful and accommodating to our Xingsui. But his appearance is too handsome, and he should\u2019ve had many entanglements in the past. I\u2019m afraid that will be a hardship for our Xingsui in the future.\u201d (as in, exes or admirers)\u201cHow could that be? I have heard many things about the eldest son of the Fu family. His private life is very clean, his personality is also very good,\u201d The old lady said with a maternal smile, \u201cBesides, the Fu family is a scholarly family with a stellar reputation. I know that their family education is very strict, so how can the children they teach be poor?\u201d Only then did Shen Guyun agree, feeling relieved .As the day turned into the night, their \u201cpart-time job\u201d tasks were finally down. Only after everyone gathered did they begin to count the money earned by each team.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s team earned a total of more than 4,000 yuan, which placed them as the highest earner. The second was Tuya\u2019s team, who earned more than 3,000 yuan. Shen Xingchen and Li Xu\u2019an got around 2,000 yuan, followed by Instructor Li\u2019s team, who also got around 2,000 yuan. As for Anran and Ning Ze, they were in last place. They only got around 1,000 yuan, which was not enough for the room fee.Shen Xingchen complained, \u201cI\u2019m so exhausted! I spent a whole day advertising and pulling customers until my throat felt sore! But in the end it wasn\u2019t enough to give me extra money!\u201dAnran also said with a bitter face, \u201cThere\u2019s too much mud in the lotus pond.\u201dEveryone looked roughed-up, only Shen Xingsui and Fu Jinxiao looked neat and tidy. It was very clear what kind of hell the other guests went through.The director didn\u2019t care about any of this, and said with a casual tone, \u201cOkay, then today\u2019s ranking is already out. Anran and Ning Ze, you two are the last, and cannot pay today\u2019s loan! As for your heavenly punishment\u2026 hm\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026. It\u2019s decided! No dinner today!\u201dAnran could only agree with a crying face.The director also added, \u201cOur part-time work practice is for two days. Today is the first day. We have to work again tomorrow. Everyone will rest in a while and prepare for tomorrow\u2019s work.\u201dEveryone was too tired to refute. They could only mumble \u201cokay\u201d listlessly.When everyone returned to the manor and entered their rooms, Anran received a contact from the program team. They reminded him of the punishment for the next day, which was also the same \u2013 waking everyone up.Anran was invigorated as soon as he heard it, \u201cDirector, how should I wake everyone up?\u201dThe director said, \u201cThis is based on the results of the audience\u2019s vote. At present, the first place with the highest public vote score is\u2026 a good morning kiss!\u201dAnran was very sad to be punished after losing, but after hearing this, his whole body was full of energy. He tried his best to hide his excitement, and asked softly, \u201cDo I need to wake everyone up?\u201dThe director nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dTruthfully, the director was looking forward to Anran\u2019s shocked reaction. He wanted something funny to cap off today\u2019s broadcast and whet the audience\u2019s appetite for tomorrow. However, he didn\u2019t know if he just saw it wrong, but why did he feel that Anran\u2019s reaction was so much different from Shen Xingsui\u2019s?Suisui was shocked and a little scared when he received the notification. Why did Anran look so happy?Anran quickly agreed, as if he was afraid that the director would go back on his word, \u201cOkie-dokie! I will definitely wake everyone up on time tomorrow.\u201dGreat, his chance finally came.He didn\u2019t understand why he suddenly tasked to wake everyone up with a kiss. But this was a chance he wasn\u2019t willing to let go! This was such a good opportunity to have an ambiguous contact with Fu Jinxiao. Who knows, after this, maybe the actor\u2019s favorability towards him would shoot up.He must do this well!1about 44 USD2\u8001\u5a46\u5b50\u201cl\u01ceop\u00f3zi\u201d, laopo is a casual way of saying \u201cwife\u201d.

He said to Shen Xingsui, who was sitting by his side, \u201cToday\u2019s hint card, open it and have a look.\u201dShen Xingsui nodded, \u201cYes!\u201dThey won the most revenue today, so they rightfully got this hint card. Shen Xingsui unfolded the card carefully, and saw a line written in a bold, blank ink: [The young master has been handsome since he was a child, and everyone around him praised him for his extraordinary appearance]\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201dShen Xingsui read the content out loud to Fu Jinxiao. He hesitantly inquired, \u201cThis is a description of the assassin, right?\u201d\u201cOr, is this the background story of the assassin in this plot? Like, he used to be of nobility before becoming an assassin.\u201dHowever\u2026 the former was much more likely than the latter. If so, then there were only two possible people: Shen Xingchen and Fu Jinxiao.Although Shen Xingsui has returned to the Shen family now, it wasn\u2019t made public. There\u2019s a possibility the director and staff didn\u2019t know this yet, and that could apply for the guests also. So, the possibility that this hint card was referring to him was minuscule.Fu Jinxiao held the card between his slender fingers, and pursed his lips: \u201cAnran is also one.\u201dShen Xingsui suddenly had a realization.That\u2019s right, as the youngest son of the Jian family, why couldn\u2019t he be regarded as a young master?Shen Xingsui fell into deep thought, and murmured, \u201cThen the scope is too big now. Besides, this is only one hint from many, it\u2019s safer to not be overly suspicious now.\u201dFu Jinxiao said, \u201cAt least for now, it is confirmed that one of the assassins is a man.\u201dShen Xingsui bitterly smiled, \u201cWell, that eliminates Instructor Tuya, she\u2019s the only woman in this group.\u201d\u201cAt least it is certain that he is a handsome man.\u201d Fu Jinxiao half-jokingly said, \u201d Talented players can suspend their suspicion and focus more on the idols.\u201dShen Xingsui answered without much thinking, \u201cThen, you\u2019re saying you are not suspicious?\u201dFu Jinxiao paused, raised his eyebrows, and the smile deepened on the corners of his mouth: \u201cAh, so I am an idol1a little context: \u201cidol\u201d is more often used to refer to celebrities, more likely singers, who rely on their good-looks instead of their skills. Since FJX is a certified Movie Emperor, calling him an idol could be counted as an insult. type in your eyes?\u201d\u201c!!\u201dAlthough Actor Fu smiled gently, Shen Xingsui still felt his scalp numb. Feeling that he had said something wrong, and waved his hands hurriedly, \u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t mean that! What I meant was that you are also very capable, but you are also very tall. Very\u2026\u201d\u2018\u2013handsome.\u2019 was left unsaid.Fu Jinxiao leaned lazily on the sofa. After taking a shower, he was wearing dark blue striped pajamas. The neckline was plunged, it was dangerously low, and you could see a hint of his firm pectorals in some angles. People said that a sexy neckline was on the hallmark of a sexy mature man, and to that, Shen Xingsui agreed. Fu Jinxiao\u2019s neck was appropriately muscled, yet still slender and inviting. He tried to avert his gaze, but it was impossible.Because they wanted to see the hint at the same time, they both sat on the couch, only half an inch apart.Shen Xingsui could even smell the faint fragrance of the actor\u2019s body soap from his body. It was obviously the same shower gel arranged by the program group, but it was different, somehow. After it was mixed with the man\u2019s original unique scent, the result was a devastating alluring fragrance.Shen Xingsui blushed while talking, Fu Jinxiao waited for a long time until the youth finished his explanation. He drawled as he leaned in closer, \u201cSo, your point is?\u201d\u201cY-you\u2026 uhm\u2026 are very capable\u2026 a-actor and singer.\u201dShen Xingsui lowered his head, and heard a chuckle from above his head. Then, Fu Jinxiao asked, \u201cThen do you prefer the idol stream or the power stream2as in, prefer \u201cidol celebs\u201d or \u201cskill-based celebs\u201d?\u201d\u201c!!\u201dWhat dangerous question was this? No matter which one he picked, there\u2019s a pit laying ahead!Shen Xingsui was very conflicted, and in the end he could only softly say, \u201cAll, I like them all.\u201dThe muffled laughter from the actor became louder. From this close, Shen Xingsui could even feel the actor\u2019s chest vibration from his laugh. The youth raised his head in shock, and there, he met with Fu Jinxiao\u2019s smiling eyes. The actor leaned leisurely on the sofa, different from his usual hypocritical fake smile. This kind of smile is more handsome and elegant, a little more real, and touching.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice was slow, magnetic yet ironic, \u201cThere are not many people in the entertainment industry who meet your qualifications, so you have to hurry up when you meet them.\u201dShen Xingsui\u2019s face flushed, and he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He must escape!!\u201cWell, Teacher Fu, I remembered that the air conditioner in my room hasn\u2019t been turned on yet, so I\u2019ll go back first.\u201d Shen Xingsui stood up in a panic. He was afraid that he might do something outrageous if he stayed any longer, \u201cGood night!\u201dThe little rabbit bolted out from the room.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows unexpectedly.\u201cTsk.\u201d\u2018I accidentally overdid it, and that little rabbit is scared away again.\u2019Sure enough, he was still young, his skin was still too thin. If he wanted to tease Shen Xingsui again, he must do it in moderation. Suppress his desire\u2026Early the next morning\u2013Anran woke up early. Because of the task assigned to him by the director team yesterday, he didn\u2019t sleep well all night. All he was thinking about was how to make good use of this good morning kiss to his utmost advantage.The audience was also a little confused when they saw Anran today:[Hahaha, why is it him?][His reaction\u2026 he seems to be eager?][Suddenly, I miss Suisui.][Hey, shy and pure children are the cutest.][I agree, their blushing and stuttering are the best! I want to pinch those flushed cheeks~]Well, as they said, like idols like fans. Both Fu Jinxiao and his fans share the same black-belly attribute.The cameraman pointed to the first room, \u201cStart from there.\u201dAnran nodded.This was Fu Jinxiao\u2019s room. He opened the door quietly, fearing that he would not succeed, he put his voice very low, and even turned his head and made a quiet \u201cshh\u201d gesture to the cameraman.The bedroom was very quiet.Anran looked closer to the bed, and finally saw Fu Jinxiao who was sleeping soundly. This man really had a god-sent face, even though his hair was a little messy because of his sleep, his almost perfect profile and innate nobility were still there. If anything, this laziness and messiness become sexy and unique, like a languid tiger sleeping \u2013 majestic, dangerous, yet beautiful. Whether it was his appearance or family background, both were top of the top.This was also one of the reasons why Anran did not give up.Fu Jinxiao\u2026 was an existence comparable as a protagonist of a story; the Chosen One; the Heaven\u2019s Darling Son. He had all the luck, status, and skills. So, the one who won Fu Jinxiao\u2019s heart was the real winner in life.That\u2019s why Fu Jinxiao must be his, so no-one would be able to compete with him.The audience in the live broadcast room also sighed:[My husband is so handsome!][Anran, your eyes are so dangerous.][Hahaha, you get out, you are not allowed to touch him!][Strange, I\u2019m a fan of Fu-ge\u2019s. I didn\u2019t feel disgusted at all when Suisui came yesterday. But, today, I wish I could call the police on Anran.]Trembling nervously, Anran slowly bent down. As he was getting closer, suddenly, the sleeping man opened his eyes. Everything changed in an instant and Anran reflexively froze in place. Before he could comprehend what\u2019s going on, his world spun and he fell to the ground with a loud crash.Fu Jinxiao, who was sitting on the bed, got up slowly. His hair was brushed on the side of his face, his head was half down. His sleepy eyes looked downright murderous, and his eyebags only emphasized this further. With a cold and dangerous tone, he almost threatened, \u201cWhat are you doing early in the morning?\u201dAnran fell to the ground and he felt his body in pain. His eyes were red and he wanted to speak pitifully, \u201cFu-ge, I\u2019m here to wake you up.\u201dActor Fu\u2019s low air pressure continued to spread. Unlike his usual smiling face, his facial features were stern when he straightened his face, especially when he was silent. Chilling tone and even chillier aura, he spoke, \u201cYesterday I worked all day, and I helped the crew until early morning. It\u2019s still dark outside, and you woke me up at this time?\u201dThe whole room was frozen by this sentence.Anran was so scared that he stammered, \u201cIt\u2019s all the director, and the director asked me to do this task\u2026\u201d\u201cA task, huh?\u201d Fu Jinxiao looked at him with dark eyes. He interrogated the younger man like Lord Yan, \u201cThen, have you finished?\u201dAnran wanted to nod his head.Fu Jinxiao almost growled, \u201cThen what are you still doing here?\u201dAnran knew an ultimatum when he heard one. With an intact survival instinct, Anran immediately ran outside. He forgot the whole \u201cmorning kiss\u201d thing, and only wanted to stay as far as possible from this murderous-looking actor. Even the cameraman didn\u2019t care about the task \u2013 he cares more about his safety, thank you!As both scared men ran away, the bedroom\u2019s door was closed with a \u201cclick\u201d. The two of them actually felt like they had survived the catastrophe at the same time.Anran murmured to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s so scary\u2026\u201dThe cameraman said like a man barely escaped a certain death, \u201cIt turns out that the legend in the industry about waking up Fu-ge is true\u2026\u201dAnd as for the netizens, their reactions were:[I\u2019m angry at Fu-ge\u2019s behest.][Yeah, if I were tired for two days in a row, and someone tasked another person to wake me up this early, I\u2019d be pissed too.][Speaking of which, he was so gentle with Suisui yesterday.][Yeah, he must\u2019ve been tired yesterday too, but he wasn\u2019t angry at all at Suisui. This double-standard is so obvious]When someone mentioned the double-standard thing, it made people gradually remember yesterday\u2019s \u201cmorning kiss\u201d scene:[Ah, ah, ah! Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? He could wake up today without being touched, and it was soooo different from yesterday!][Sister, you found that detail!][So it seems that he was already awake even before Suisui kissed him yesterday?][Hahahahahaha, oh my God!!]The netizens were already in a pitch-fever just by relying on their guesses. There were endless debates about whether Fu Jinxiao is awake or not, but they couldn\u2019t come up with convincing evidence on either camp. Mainly it\u2019s because Fu Jinxiao\u2019s award for best actor was not for nothing. Yes, as long as he wanted, his acting skills could fool anyone. So of course, it\u2019s not easy to guess whether or not he was faking being asleep.If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1a little context: \u201cidol\u201d is more often used to refer to celebrities, more likely singers, who rely on their good-looks instead of their skills.

Enjoy today\u2019s bonus chapter~Next ko-fi goals for bonus chapter (0/2)On the other side-Not long after waking Fu Jinxiao up, ghosts and wolves wailed1very noisy from every room.Shen Xingsui woke up early by himself, there was no need for Anran to shout. In contrast, Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t wake up despite all the hubris happening around him. Not even violence could stir this young master from his slumber. You could try to yank his quilt, but that would lead him into screeching like a banshee, which annoyed Anran to no end. Waking him up was the ultimate test of patience, it seemed.Like this, what kind of luck did Shen Xingsui have yesterday? Let alone kissing Fu Jinxiao, all of his tasks were solved because of a power outage. How could he be like this?After the war of waking everyone up, the director gathered everyone together. With a sunny smile that was asking for a beat-down, he asked, \u201cHow did everyone\u2019s rest last night?\u201dEveryone wailed in unison, \u201cDirector, if you didn\u2019t wake us up so early in the morning, we would be happier.\u201dThe director\u2019s smile got wider instead, \u201cAh, I\u2019m waking you all nice and early because I would like to thank everyone for their hard work yesterday. So, I prepared breakfast for everyone. I hope you can enjoy your meal.\u201dFree breakfast? What\u2019s the catch?Do the crew think the guests were a bunch of idiots? There\u2019s no way this program would suddenly become humane out of nowhere. This was a reality show, it solely exists to torment them as a form of entertainment.However, the director clapped his hands as if to improve his own credibility, and a staff member came out pushing carts. Eight small carts were pushed, and each cart contained a rich breakfast. Steamed buns, youtiao, soy milk, as well as bread and milk, cereals and so on.Shen Xingchen was shocked, \u201cDirector, you finally did something human!\u201dDirector: \u201c\u2026\u201dThank you for complimenting me.Only Fu Jinxiao asked, \u201cCan these be eaten freely?\u201dHe was experienced with this kind of show, and he hit the point with one sentence. And sure enough, he saw the director\u2019s smile get brighter, \u201cI\u2019m glad you ask. Of course not! Everyone can only choose three breakfast items!\u201dSure enough, a dog could only be a dog.However, compared to the free food of yesterday, today was an outright banquet. Everyone swallowed their opinions, and consciously picked up the breakfast they wanted to eat and started eating.As the guests enjoyed their warm breakfast, the director told everyone about today\u2019s task, \u201cYesterday\u2019s revenue will be used to pay your loan, and any leftover will be used for today\u2019s initial capital. You all will work as businessmen today! There are no restrictions on methods and conditions on what you sell or how you sell it; but there are only two rules: first, you can\u2019t sell things higher than the market price, and second, you can\u2019t rely on your celebrity status to advertise your business! Once someone recognizes you because of your celebrity status, the amount of this transaction will be invalidated and will not be included in the total amount.\u201d This rule largely prevented some people from cheating, relying on their popularity to gain unfair advantage.And on top of that, this would incentive people to get creative in their ways of making money.The director continued his explanation,\u00a0 \u201cWhen each of your teams is earning money, they may get clues about the assassin along the way. At the same time, I want to tell everyone that the team that earns the most money today will get rich rewards at the end!\u201dEveryone applauded together as they got more excited.Shen Xingchen asked the director, \u201cThen, is there a limit to the number of people in a team?\u201dThe director was very open this time, \u201cMaximum four people to a group. However, you can\u2019t split up from yesterday\u2019s teammate!\u201dThat is, to reach the maximum number of people, two groups will merge into one.Shen Xingchen stood beside Shen Xingsui without hesitation, and the four of them formed a small team without a fuss.\u201cHow do we make money?\u201d Shen Xingchen made a suggestion, \u201cLi Xu\u2019an and I didn\u2019t earn a lot from working yesterday. Should I find a store to sell things by myself today?\u201dLi Xu\u2019an gave his input, \u201cThen have you decided on your wares?\u201dShen Xingchen shook his head naively, he didn\u2019t have a business mind like his brother, so he could only say, \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it, what can this small town sell?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Xu\u2019an wisely remained silent.Shen Xingchen casted his eyes on Fu Jinxiao again and asked, \u201cFu-ge, do you have any suggestions?\u201dIn shows like this, Fu Jinxiao used to be silent unless he was asked. He mainly wanted to let others get their own limelight, because he knew he was very attention-grabbing. Actor Fu has always been very tactful, and it applied to today\u2019s competition as well with his Buddhist behavior.Answering to Shen Xingchen\u2019s question, he spoke with an indifferent tone, \u201cNope.\u201dNetizens didn\u2019t know the reason for Fu Jinxiao\u2019s sudden salted fish2very passive, not doing anything. behavior, so they could only laugh:[Hahaha, I even think Fu-ge wants to go back and catch up on sleep.][Money is something outside of his concern.][After all, there is no punishment for failing today.]Another group was situated nearby, so they could very easily eavesdrop. Seeing a golden opportunity to pull far ahead of Fu-cheating-Jinxiao, they grabbed it in a flash. After setting up a strategy with pride, Instructor Li said with a puffed-up chest, \u201cThere is a big flower field behind our bookstore, so we decided to sell flowers!\u201dShen Xingsui was standing closest to him, so he politely commented, \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, good luck.\u201dInstructor Li was a funny and entertaining-type of celebrity. He smiled at Shen Xingsui and said, \u201cSuisui, have you made up your mind yet?\u201dShen Xingsui shook his head and replied honestly, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHurry up!\u201d Instructor Li said with a smile, \u201cWe have already decided, we will definitely make a lot of money today, and we\u2019ll let you know how good we are.\u201dShen Xingsui saw Teacher Li\u2019s funny appearance, and said in response, \u201cYou are already very good.\u201dThe instructor was amused by this well-behaved and sensible child, so he came over and pat Shen Xingsui on the shoulder, showing a smug smile, \u201cOhoho? You youngsters sure have good eyes to see my true power. For the sake of your admiration for me, we will win today.\u201dShen Xingsui politely chuckled, \u201cCome on then!\u201dThe two were playing and laughing, and the atmosphere was very good. As for Fu Jinxiao, who was originally lazy standing not far away, looked at this scene with a mysterious gait. The smile in his eyes gradually faded away, especially when Instructor Li\u2019s hand touched the youth\u2019s shoulder. His lips were pursed into a thin line, and people had this subconscious feeling to avoid him.Shen Xingchen babbled next to him and said harshly, \u201cWe won\u2019t lose! Instructor Li, just wait! We are definitely the group that earns the most today!\u201dFu Jinxiao looked down at the young master, then suddenly asked him, \u201cDo you know where the farmer\u2019s market is in this town?\u201dShen Xingchen was still preparing to confront Instructor Li, but he was taken aback when he heard this question, \u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking you, do you know where the farmer\u2019s market is?\u201d Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, \u201cGo over there to see if there are any products we can buy in bulk so it\u2019s cheaper. Then, we can sell that to gain profit.\u201dShen Xingchen looked at Fu Jinxiao who suddenly became serious, and hesitated, \u201cFu-ge, didn\u2019t you just say you have no suggestions? Why do you want to go to the farmer\u2019s market all of a sudden?\u201dFu Jinxiao let out a \u201chuh\u201d and a dangerous smile, \u201cDid I say that?\u201d\u201cMy bad\u2026 I must have misheard.\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast room were all overjoyed:[It\u2019s exciting to see Xingchen bullied like this!][This sudden damned desire to win.][Fu-ge, what\u2019s happened to you, hahaha!]As the show aired, the ratings of \u201cBright Stars\u201d were getting higher and higher. Mainly, because this show was authentic. They didn\u2019t coddle the celebrities \u2013 if they were tasked to cook, then they must cook. Moving bricks is really moving bricks; the mosquitoes everywhere are also real; getting up in the morning is real, especially extra real because they are all bare-faced. And this was the reason the audience loved this show. No script, no coddling, no nonsense.In the early morning, the farmers market was extra bustling.Shen Xingchen wanted to buy everything he saw along the way. But he remembered his current financial condition and could only suggest two things after he took things into consideration, \u201cI think that toy stand is good, let\u2019s buy some toys and sell them? Or, maybe selling candies, like cotton candies?\u201dHowever, Fu Jinxiao thought this was equal to useless chatter. A childish one, that is.The more people walked inside, the more people there were staring at them. Each of them put on a hat, put on light makeup, and tried to be as low-key as possible, but along the way, they didn\u2019t see any business that could be done.Until\u2026When they passed by the vegetable market, I saw a very old grandpa who looked dark and thin. In front of him were cleaned persimmons and pears, and beside him was a small bag of walnuts. The booth was old, covered with a crinkled plastic sheet, which looked very simple. While other stall owners were working hard, collecting payment with the payment code, only the old man was sitting there a little confused and uneasy.Someone came over and asked about the price. After hearing it, they looked disgusted,\u00a0 \u201cCan you make it cheaper?\u201dThe old man\u2019s voice was a little low and hoarse, \u201cThey are all home-grown. They are very good. They are sold at this price in the market.\u201dBut he hesitated, his eyes were full of cautious helplessness. So in the end, he relented, \u201cI\u2026 could sell it a bit lower, but don\u2019t have that code. I need money for my son, can you pay with cash?\u201dThe buyer was impatient, \u201cWho goes out with physical cash in this day and age? Forget it, I won\u2019t buy it.\u201dAfter they left, no one cared about the old man\u2019s stall again.This scene looked a little sad, but it seemed to be a true portrayal of what happened to many elderly people. Many elderly people in the mountains have never touched a smartphone in their entire life, let alone use modern payment methods. Even if they have it, it was because of their children. But without those modern payment methods, they couldn\u2019t earn the money they need. On top of that, many of them lived alone, as their children had long gone elsewhere. Even if their children wanted to give them money, it\u2019s hard without the said modern payment. Most of them end up in a lonely end.Shen Xingchen looked a little annoyed, he was pure and kind by nature, and shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s go buy it and sell it!\u201dOthers had no objections either.But everyone seemed to agree on a silent consensus \u2013 they all looked at Fu Jinxiao at the same time, just like children who have to ask their parents when they buy something.Actor Fu was silent for a moment, and finally took the lead. He walked to the old man\u2019s stall, knelt down to check the quality of the fruit, asked about the price, and finally said, \u201cHow many fruits like this do you have?\u201dThe old man didn\u2019t expect such a question, and hesitantly said, \u201cThere are a lot of plants in the back of the house.\u201d\u201cAll of them are yours?\u201d Actor Fu asked in detail, \u201cAre they all mature already? How far away are they? Can we purchase them all now?\u201dThe old man answered everything. It turned out that he lived in Houshan, a mountainside village not far from Taohua Town. The village was relatively peaceful with rich soil, but it was not as prosperous as the small town. Many people in the village grew their own fruits and vegetables.As for the old man, these fruits were something he grew on his own plot of land. He really couldn\u2019t sell them all-year around, so it would be abundant during the season, and it became cheaper as a result. In the end, they were normally sold to unscrupulous businessmen at a low price, and they themselves can\u2019t get much money.Fu Jinxiao nodded, and finally decided, \u201cLet\u2019s go and have a look.\u201dThe old man asked suspiciously, \u201cAre you really going to buy it?\u201dShen Xingchen patted his chest and said, \u201cOf course it\u2019s true, don\u2019t lie! Don\u2019t worry, this yo\u2013\u201dBefore he finished speaking, Shen Xingsui covered his mouth, and whispered anxiously to his older brother, \u201cNo, the director said that if the deal is concluded in the name of a celebrity, it will not be counted as a rule break!\u201dOnly then did Shen Xingchen react slowly, and after a moment of fear, he affirmed to his younger brother, \u201cYou are still smart.\u201dShen Xingsui sighed helplessly.Seeing the old man\u2019s expression, the netizens couldn\u2019t help but laugh:[Suisui, you can be louder, don\u2019t worry.][Hahaha, these two brothers are really silly.][They\u2019re so cute!]Although the old man didn\u2019t understand much, he understood that these were good people, so he cooperated and didn\u2019t ask any more questions. He led the people to the village quickly from the small road on the mountain, and then led them to see the fruit forest. The fruits here were very good, much better looking than many sold outside. However, since the village\u2019s populations were mostly the elderly, it\u2019s hard for them to get a connection to sell them outside.The arrival of the program group, in just a few days, brought a huge amount of traffic and customers to Taohua Town, and also brought vitality and hope to this poor village.Fu Jinxiao nodded after checking, \u201cOkay, Xingchen and Li Xu\u2019an, you can help pick the fruit together. I will leave you with 200 yuan for an emergency. You go to the village to see if there is anyone who is willing to come and help you for cheap. You\u2019d better move quickly, get it done before noon. Suisui and I will go back to the town to look at the stalls and prepare to sell things.\u201dShen Xingchen nodded, \u201cOkay, no problem.\u201dAnyway, mental work is not suitable for him. Plus, picking fruits was way better than moving goods yesterday.After Fu Jinxiao finished giving his orders, he took Shen Xingsui and left. On the way back, Fu Jinxiao kept calculating profits and things to prepare for doing business.People said that serious men were the most handsome, to which Shen Xingsui whole-heartedly agreed. The youth watched the actor working hard in writing down all of his calculations. With awe, he said, \u201cTeacher Fu, you are really amazing. You can arrange everything in an orderly manner. Why do you have so many ideas?\u201dFu Jinxiao put down the pen, glanced sideways at him, and raised his eyebrows. \u201cWell, I have a lot of practice.\u201dShen Xingsui nodded seriously.\u201cAmazing!\u201d Fu Jinxiao\u2019s number one fan praised his idol without hesitation, his eyes seemed to be filled with stars, \u201cYou are really amazing!\u201dNormally, Actor Fu would accept this compliment humbly. But today\u2026 he was rather different. Fu Jinxiao slowly turned his face to the side and calmed down a little. The corners of his mouth curled up with an arc of interest, and he opened his lips to ask, \u201cWhat about your Instructor Li?\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c??\u201dA question mark slowly appeared on top of Shen Xingsui\u2019s head.\u201cAh?\u201d Shen Xingsui was at a loss, \u201cWhat, what about Instructor Li?\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t understand, someone in the live broadcast room understood and immediately laughed:[Hahaha, this vengeful and narrow-minded man.][My mother, this is so cute.][Actor Fu, are you a primary school student?][Hahahaha, is this the dignity of a man?]If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^1very noisy2very passive, not doing anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There\u2019s a bonus chapter sponsored today~Next ko-fi donation goals for the bonus chapter (0/2)Shen Xingsui was a little confused about that Instructor Li question.Fu Jinxiao looked at the dazed youth, his round eyes, his tilted face, his fair face was slightly red under the sun. His posture was completely defenseless, like a white, tender rabbit that he can clean up directly. Simple and cute.Well, if Shen Xingsui didn\u2019t understand what he meant, then he would just let it be.The unhappiness in Fu Jinxiao\u2019s heart dissipated when he saw the youth\u2019s na\u00efve appearance. He curled his lips, picked up the paper and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be at the farmer\u2019s market later, no matter what I say, don\u2019t make a sound.\u201dShen Xingsui nodded.Fu Jinxiao was a little surprised, \u201cAre you not curious with my reason?\u201dShen Xingsui turned his head to look at him directly. With a light smile in his warm eyes, bright and brilliant, he said softly, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask, because I believe in you.\u201dFu Jinxiao\u2019s pupils widened.He has achieved many things in his life \u2013 becoming the pillar of a company, the heir of his famous family, and the idol of his fans. He has felt the highs of life, and yet, the excitement he felt inside his heart never reached this level of intensity. It beat erratically, filling his chest cavity with loud heart thumps.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s grin widened, showing a row of teeth. He half-jokingly said, \u201cWhat if I take you and sell you off?Shen Xingsui seemed to be caught off-guard, \u201cI\u2019m not worth much, am I?\u201dFu Jinxiao couldn\u2019t hold back a muffled laugh.The audience in the live broadcast room were also chuckling along:[What kind of fairy boy is this?][My Suisui, so cute.][lmao1the original is xswl or \u7b11\u6b7b\u6211\u4e86 \u201cxi\u00e0o s\u01d0 w\u01d2 le\u201d; I\u2019m laughing to death., it seems to move Actor Fu too!][Ah, so this is how Fu-ge looks when he\u2019s laughing whole-heartedly.]\u201cJust kidding,\u201d Seeing his flustered appearance, Fu Jinxiao softened his heart a little. Finally, the car they\u2019ve been waiting for just arrived at the market. As he walked towards the car, he said \u201cI\u2019m reluctant to sell you off.\u201dAs he climbed into the car, Shen Xingsui almost slipped because he was startled.The autumn sun was warm and comforting. As it traveled through Shen Xingsui\u2019s body, it also warmed up his heart.Fu Jinxiao, who had trailed behind him, said, \u201cWhy are you so absent-minded? Be careful.\u201dShen Xingsui came back to his senses and\u00a0 nodded in response. He was still smiling brightly, despite being tired thanks to the task, despite there were many unknown difficulties ahead.Many times in the past, facing the established tragic fate, he felt like falling into darkness. He was very unreconciled, and did not want to give up. But fate had other things to say and he had to give up struggling directly.But he knew that it\u2019s different now. A flimsy candle lit up inside his heart, swaying in the wind, yet still burning brightly.Waiting ahead for him was Fu Jinxiao.His light.The farmer\u2019s market was full of fish and dragons2a mix of powerful people and commoners, and you can\u2019t easily tell which is which., and there were all kinds of businesses. To find a good stall to sell fruits, the location was one of the cornerstones. In the end, Fu Jinxiao chose a place with convenient transportation and dense traffic. There was one empty booth left, but it was owned by the antique shop next door and was very expensive to rent.Fu Jinxiao and Shen Xingsui looked at each other and walked into the store.After briefly expressing his interest, the boss didn\u2019t recognize Fu Jinxiao because he was wearing sunglasses, so he directly refused: \u201cNo, what do you mean 200 yuan for a day? Absolutely not.\u201d\u201cThen how much do you propose?\u201d\u201cAt least 1,000.\u201d The boss made the offer, \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll be reaping a loss. Take it or leave it.\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded slightly, and said slowly to himself, \u201cI see, this is going to be difficult\u2026\u201dShen Xingsui felt very uncomfortable beside him. He was doubtful if they still have 1,000 yuan after buying the fruits. Fu-ge himself was a ruthless person to lower the prince directly to 200 yuan, as they both know after asking around that the booth renting price was around 700 yuan. The boss was also black-hearted to hike the price up to 1,000 yuan.The boss was real stubborn though.Coincidentally, at this time, some customers came to the store. They were two female tourists. They came to look at the antiques in the store, and they were very interested when they saw a delicate and beautiful peach blossom bowl.The boss said with an earnest tone, \u201cAhaha! These two young ladies really have good eyesight. As for this bowl, this was made during the early Western Zhou Dynasty\u2026\u201dJust as the two tourists were about to pay for it, they noticed Fu Jinxiao and Shen Xingsui standing beside them, and they were a little curious, \u201cAre you also here to buy things?\u201dThese two men might wear sunglasses to hide their face, but they couldn\u2019t hide their noble bearing. Especially the taller one \u2013 with broad shoulders, narrow waist, slender and long legs\u2026 he was really attractive. It\u2019s the kind of charm that would subconsciously attract people no matter what.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice was equally deep and magnetic, \u201cWe\u2019re here to just look around.\u201dThe two young ladies nodded as they took a few more sneaky glances at the eye-candy,\u00a0 \u201cThen do you like this Western Zhou bowl too?\u201dFu Jinxiao said slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s.. ah\u2026 quite interesting, I would say.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d The man paused, hooked his lips, lowered his head a little, and said slowly, \u201cAccording to my visual observation, this should not be from the Western Zhou Dynasty, but from last week.\u201dThe store was quiet for a moment.The boss, of course, was furious, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what you are talking about, my shop is full of authentic works!\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows as if to challenge him, \u201cReally?\u201dThe boss flinched, clearly feeling his guilty conscience. Fu Jinxiao\u2019s sharp eyes noticed this, and took this opportunity to point at a vase. Then, he said, \u201cThis.. is the Yongle blue and white porcelain vase of the Ming Dynasty. It\u2019s characterized by a round lid, with brocade patterns all over its body. It\u2019s famous for its exquisite workmanship and natural and beautiful printing.\u201dThe boss was confused, but he didn\u2019t forget to boast his wares, \u201cYou are quite knowledgeable, this porcelain vase is the treasure of the shop.\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows. He walked to the vase, glanced roughly, and opened his lips, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s a fake. The blue-and-white porcelain vases of the Ming Dynasty have always had a common feature, because of the technical limitations at that time, so when firing porcelain\u2026\u201dA series of professional terminologies that people couldn\u2019t understand at all came out of Actor Fu\u2019s mouth. It made people in the shop stunned for a second.The two tourists seemed to realize that something was wrong, and immediately refused to buy the peach blossom bowl.The boss was also stunned stupid. He wanted to refute, but he felt faintly that he might have met an expert so he didn\u2019t dare say anything at all. He could only angrily say, \u201cWhy would you want to ruin my business? Didn\u2019t you just want to rent a stall? 200 is still too low, you know! Fine! 600 for a day is okay. Don\u2019t make any more trouble!\u201dFu Jinxiao had this rogue smile on him, \u201c300 yuan.\u201dThe boss was anxious, \u201c300?? Do you want to steal my money?!\u201dFu Jinxiao walked out, and said slowly, \u201cSince we can\u2019t talk about it\u2026 well, isn\u2019t the stall outside also yours? I\u2019ll go and have a look, then.\u201d\u201c\u2026For you to be cruel, 500.\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, \u201c250.\u201dThe boss was stunned by this man\u2019s sheer audacity. \u201cWhy did you lower the price by 50? No, no, at least 500.\u201dFu Jinxiao was as steady as an old dog, \u201c200.\u201dThe boss was furious, but he could only gritted his teeth, \u201cOkay, okay, 300 is 300.\u201dFu Jinxiao curled his lips and said, \u201cDeal.\u201dHe actually was content with getting 600-700 yuan as the renting fee, but who knows that his insistence could lower it to 300? It\u2019s such a good location too, he won big this time.After leaving the door, Shen Xingsui finally couldn\u2019t help but said, \u201cTeacher Fu, you are so amazing. How could you tell at a glance that the vase is fake? Where did you learn all of that?\u201dFu Jinxiao answered nonchalantly, looking completely innocent, \u201cHm? At a glance? Of course I can\u2019t. I was too far away to see it clearly.\u201dShen Xingsui was taken aback, \u201cAh, then you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was to scare him at the time,\u201d Fu Jinxiao walked outside, and said slowly, \u201cAs for those The basis for the identification is also my nonsense. He has a guilty conscience, so of course he won\u2019t refute it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShen Xingsui fell into silence.The audience in the live broadcast laughed like crazy:[This bullshitting technique is too high!!][You are really a thief.][Too bad I\u2019m in love with such a doggy man!]After Shen Xingsui doubted his life, he finally managed to say something, \u201cBut no matter what, we still have a big advantage!\u201dFu Jinxiao tried to contact Shen Xingchen and Li Xu\u2019an who were picking the fruit. Then, he asked Shen Xingsui, \u201cDo you think that the antique shop\u2019s boss is eating a loss?\u201dShen Xingsui thought for a while, then nodded his head.Fu Jinxiao was a little surprised, looked away from the phone, and asked, \u201cHm\u2026 how to say this\u2026\u201dShen Xingsui tried to guess, \u201cAh, so uhm\u2026 what you said was a mixture of truth and lies. But, the way that boss earns money is not righteous. I also don\u2019t doubt that there are quite a few counterfeit antiques there.\u201dFu Jinxiao smiled, \u201cLittle Comrade Shen has become smarter.\u201dShen Xingsui choked up, why did it feel like Fu Jinxiao was praising a child? He was obviously not young anymore!Netizens in the live broadcast room also sighed:[Yeah, that unscrupulous boss definitely won\u2019t lose money.][In the future, us fans will check that boss. He better only sell the real thing. Or else.][Hahahaha, with that kind of supervision, he won\u2019t dare selling fakes anymore!][That kind of lying dog needs whips to be honest.]The fruits picked by Shen Xingchen and Li Xu\u2019an were delivered soon. The stall that they rented also had basically been cleaned up. It was almost noon by this time, but everyone was full of energy, no one was tired or hungry.After the stall was set up, someone came to ask the price as they looked around.After Shen Xingchen quoted the price, he wanted to help others weigh, but he didn\u2019t know how to use this electronic scale3you know, the ones you see in the fruit counter in supermarkets?. He was dumbfounded and looked at Li Xu\u2019an, \u201cCan you?\u201dLi Xu\u2019an shook his head, \u201cI haven\u2019t used this either.\u201dThese young masters had never seen this kind of scales, let alone used them. Thankfully, Shen Xingsui stood up and said, \u201cI will \u201cHe took a bag, packed the fruits skillfully, then measured the weight on the electronic scale. Finally, he said to the buyer with a smile, \u201cThe total is 15.3 jin41 jin (\u65a4) = 0.5 kg, you can pay it for 15 jin. Thank you for the purchase and come again~\u201d\u201cOh, 1 yuan per jin? That\u2019s quite cheap for this quality. I also get a 30 jiao51 yuan = 10 jiao/mao (\u89d2) = 100 fen (\u5206). discount? Thank you, thank you.\u201d The customer was satisfied, and they immediately pulled out their phone to pay.Their payment code was just printed, and the payment can be completed after scanning.When the first payment came in, the mobile phone at the stall rang the Alipay prompt. Although it was only 15 yuan, it inexplicably boosted morale and made everyone very excited.Shen Xingchen smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s sold!\u201d\u201cWe actually made a sale.\u201d Shen Xingchen wiped the sweat off his face, \u201cSuisui, you can use it? That\u2019s not bad, ah!\u201dA shy smile appeared on Shen Xingsui\u2019s face, \u201cI used to work as a cashier when I was at my part-time job.\u201dShen Xingchen praised him, \u201cAmazing!\u201dWhen the cameraman got closer, the camera gave Young Master Shen a close-up shot. It let everyone see the stains on his face clearly. Because he was picking fruits, his whole body was dirty. The sunlight rays in Taohua Town were strong, the temperature was high, and his whole body was a little red from the sun. But the spiky-haired young man didn\u2019t care at all. On the contrary, he actively promoted and recruited customers, \u201cFresh and organic6I actually have Words to say about the whole \u201corganic\u201d sale gimmick, but I\u2019ll refrain this time.

It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t buy it, you can just have a look!\u201dThe young master successfully gained the attention of the passersby, and slowly some potential customers began pouring in.\u201cThis peach is too soft, sadly\u2026\u201d\u201cCan the price be cheaper?\u201d\u201cYoung man, hurry up, pack it, I\u2019m in a hurry!\u201dShen Xingsui responded one by one, actively communicated with the buyers, and answered when someone asked, \u201cNo problem, no problem. If there is a problem, you can get it for free~\u201dThe weather in Taohua Town was too hot.He stood there, talking and moving non-stop, his back was soaked in sweat. During \u201cStarlight\u201d, he was a shy, quiet kid. But now, he was much more vibrant and communicative. He worked hard without complaint, even his fair skin was flushed from the sun, but he didn\u2019t complain one bit.There was also a thin layer of sweat on Shen Xingsui\u2019s forehead. He didn\u2019t have time to fix his messy hair. He just casually wiped his face with a towel before going back to work. His delicate face revealed determination. When facing customers, his warm eyes always smiling, meticulous and patient, his long hair looks sunny and energetic.Netizens in the live broadcast room were caught in this charm.[He is so hardworking.][I agree, Suisui is really hardworking.][I didn\u2019t like him before, because I thought he was such a boring person. But now, I suddenly understand his charm value!][The most adorable little cutie in the world~]Slowly, even the audience felt the subtle changes in Shen Xingsui.He was no longer so dull and suffocated. Since the broadcast of \u201cStarlight\u201d, he seemed to have slowly integrated into the group, opening himself. Like a bud of a flower on the edge of winter, once spring comes, it blossoms into a beautiful flower, delicate petals with vibrant colors. Now the whole world could see his beauty. Everyone felt this change was gratifying \u2013 watching a young man slowly cultivated himself into a better version of himself.1the original is xswl or \u7b11\u6b7b\u6211\u4e86 \u201cxi\u00e0o s\u01d0 w\u01d2 le\u201d; I\u2019m laughing to death.2a mix of powerful people and commoners, and you can\u2019t easily tell which is which.3you know, the ones you see in the fruit counter in supermarkets?41 jin (\u65a4) = 0.5 kg51 yuan = 10 jiao/mao (\u89d2) = 100 fen (\u5206).6I actually have Words to say about the whole \u201corganic\u201d sale gimmick, but I\u2019ll refrain this time.

Sweat soaked his shirt, and the harsh sunlight didn\u2019t subside one bit. However, he still had the energy to speak loudly amidst the bustling crowd. \u201cAh, I forgot! We also brought sugarcanes, it\u2019s over there. There\u2019s also pineapples, but we didn\u2019t purchase them from that grandpa. They are from another villager, they entrusted us to sell it altogether, and we agreed.

Does he have this kind of skill?But in fact, this was something Fu Jinxiao really knew how to do. He rolled up his sleeves, picked up the pineapple, and began to cut it with a knife. Firstly, he slowly peeled the skin, then he cut off the pocks in the fruit\u2019s flesh. After he finished that, he cut them into smaller pieces and put them in boxes. He did them all skillfully at a respectable speed to boot.The others were dumbfounded and applauded.Shen Xingchen was watching and praised him loudly, \u201cAwesome! Why do you have this secret skill?!\u201dAfter Fu Jinxiao packed the fruit for the guests, he glanced at him and said, \u201cYou are not bad, you have your own unique skills.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Shen Xingchen asked curiously, with a touch of anticipation, \u201cWhat special skills do I have?\u201dFu Jinxiao gracefully smiled, \u201cYour stupidity is on a special level.\u201dHolding his younger brother\u2019s arm, Shen Xingchen wailed, \u201cSuisui, look at him making fun of me! Hurry up and avenge your ge!\u201dShen Xingsui: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t laugh or cry.Netizens in the live broadcast room were all amused by their funny scene:[Suisui: Don\u2019t look for me, I can\u2019t afford to mess with him.][Hahaha, Xingchen you can try suing Fu-ge if you want.][At least he\u2019s aware that Suisui has a higher status with Fu Jinxiao compared to himself.][LMAO]This group of four had to sell a huge amount of fruit all day. Finally, near dusk, their energy was spent and they went hungry. But since there was still some fruit left over, someone needed to watch it. Fu Jinxiao was indeed the parent of this ragtag group, and he ordered the juniors to eat, while he was here to watch over the stall.Shen Xingsui followed his older brother to a street not far away to buy food. After arriving there, Shen Xingchen drank water like crazy, \u201cI\u2019m soooo thirsty.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an kept persuading him, \u201cSlow down, okay? Don\u2019t choke.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d Shen Xingchen said arrogantly, \u201cHow could I choke\u2026 Hack\u2026 cough, cough\u2026\u201dThe idiot who said harsh words just now was caught choking in the next second. Like a proper dumbass.Shen Xingsui patted him on the back helplessly, \u201cGe, slow down.\u201dShen Xingchen finally recovered and gave Li Xu\u2019an a hard look, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault. Crow\u2019s mouth1SXC accuses LXA of jinxing it..\u201dLi Xu\u2019an: \u201c\u2026\u201dThey went to the front desk and ordered meals. This store was famous for its seaweed rice crackers. Shen Xingchen directly requested, \u201cDo you have the one without seaweed? My di is allergic.\u201dShen Xingchen bought a few packs of them, and handed a pack to Shen Xingsui, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I saw this, and I didn\u2019t expect this small town to sell it, eat it quickly.\u201dShen Xingsui was a little dazed after receiving it.Shen Xingchen ate several mouthfuls, looked at him suspiciously and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat it? What? You haven\u2019t eaten it before? When I was young, the school canteen sold it.\u201dShen Xingsui had a weird expression on his face, but he answered honestly, \u201cNo, I have eaten this before.\u201dShen Xingchen said with a smile, \u201cGood, good. Let me tell you, when I was young, my friends and I pooled money to buy this together. Sometimes when one of our group\u2019s pocket money ran out, we would pool the money to buy it for him. Ah\u2026 so nostalgic. I still remember that my xiao-di at that time were very loyal. As long as I asked, a bunch of them will buy it for me. Heh, can you imagine how mighty your ge is?\u201dShen Xingsui shook his head with a blank look.Shen Xingchen didn\u2019t care, and he continued to wave his hand, \u201cJust imagine it like that one friend who invites you to eat snacks. Now, multiply the number of friends who did that. And\u2026 voila, you should get it.\u201dShen Xingsui was still in a daze.Shen Xingchen felt bored, and said casually, \u201cYou can\u2019t even imagine this? What, nobody has invited you to eat before?\u201dShen Xingsui was still holding the snack packs in his hand. He hesitated for a moment and said, \u201cThere are.\u201dShen Xingchen was a little nervous when he saw his brother\u2019s state. After he heard that, he was relieved. However, before he could comment, Shen Xingsui chuckled and said with a disturbingly light tone, \u201cI treated them to dinner.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAll Shen Xingchen\u2019s words were stuck in his throat.As a big brother, he was very distressed. He felt something was wrong. Holding back his anger, he asked, \u201cAre your school friends so stingy?\u201dShen Xingsui opened a pack of rice crackers, and said softly, \u201cAt that time, if I had some pocket money, I would treat them to eat. When my pocket money was used up, nobody would invite me. Maybe they knew my monetary condition, so they don\u2019t want to embarass me by inviting me but cannot pay.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThose bastards were obviously using you as an ATM!Shen Xingchen was short of breath, trying to hold off his anger, \u201cWhat kind of friends are these? Heartless bunch of turds.\u201dAlthough it was only about buying food for friends \u2013 such a trivial matter \u2013 it did manage to increase the barrage in the live broadcast room a lot:[When he was young? That\u2019s so\u2026][Suisui is really miserable.][Wait, didn\u2019t a bunch of people come out on Weibo and say that he bullied his classmates?][Are you on 2G? That\u2019s old news! Even Anran said it was fake.]Originally, the heat of this matter went down. But thanks to this, the netizens started to remember this unfinished scandal.[Anran really didn\u2019t make a serious apology afterwards.][Wait, didn\u2019t during the \u201cStarlight\u201d recording, he made a seaweed pastry and offered it to Suisui? He\u2019s obviously allergic!][Such a vicious man.][Can upstairs be kind? At that time, Ranran already posted an apology statement on Weibo. He can no longer be blamed for this! He didn\u2019t know!]At first, everyone was just making complaints about it. But Anran\u2019s fans were very protective of their bias, so they quickly turned from defensive to overly defensive. They started saying scathing arguments, which pissed quite a lot of people.[Huh, I don\u2019t know that you HAVE TO accept every apology someone gives you.][This is just blatant victim-blaming.][If Anran is really that angelic, then look at this group. Tell me, who still likes him enough to be his close friend?]This was the spark that started the fire, and another fandom war started in the live broadcast room. But, the guests didn\u2019t know about this situation just yet.Shen Xingsui finished his meal relatively quickly. He quickly packed a portion and returned to the stall. There were not many people in the stall in the afternoon, only a few customers were there. With small steps, he ran over to Jinxiao and greeted him with a smile, \u201cTeacher Fu, I\u2019m back!\u201dFu Jinxiao looked back, saw the sweat on his head, and said helplessly, \u201cWhy are you running in such a hurry? No one will rob your food.\u201dThe youth walked aside, pulled down a chair and sat on it. \u201cI\u2019m just afraid that you\u2019re hungry.\u201dFu Jinxiao took the lunch box and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s this? No need to buy me food, I\u2019ll eat later. Besides, I\u2019m used to this, during filming, I can even work without eating all day.\u201dShen Xingsui knew about Fu Jinxiao\u2019s hard work.He silently thought about it inside his heart. Just as he handed over chopsticks, he caught a glance of Fu Jinxiao\u2019s red palms. It had scrapes, calluses, and a few broken blisters.Shen Xingsui couldn\u2019t hold back, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your hand?\u201dFu Jinxiao was slightly surprised. He didn\u2019t expect the youth to notice, and he was afraid that he would be worried, so he downplayed it, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t today, it was scalded while I was cooking yesterday. It\u2019s okay, the director\u2019s team brought some ointment last night, and it\u2019s already almost healed.\u201dAfter speaking, there was a complete silence.He was lying, Shen Xingsui knew.He didn\u2019t speak at all, but recalled that at noon, Fu Jinxiao had been helping customers cut pineapples and sugarcanes. The surface of those fruits was rough, and he had to work non-stop. He\u2019s sure that it must be painful to work with an injured palm like that. There\u2019s a lot of nerve endings in the tip of the fingers, after all. He had blisters before, and he knew the level of pain he had to endure when it broke because of external means.But Fu Jinxiao didn\u2019t say anything about his injury yesterday, and if Shen Xingsui hadn\u2019t spotted this today, he might not have said a word.The actor was confused as to why the youth stopped talking. He saw Shen Xingsui\u2019s red eyes as soon as he raised his head. This surprised Actor Fu a little, and he laughed to ease his worry, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, who messed with you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 \u201cShen Xingsui breathed out lightly and wanted to speak, but his nose was sour. Thankfully, he couldn\u2019t hold off a couple drops of tears. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me why you were hurt.\u201dWhen he cried, Fu Jinxiao immediately panicked.To be honest, Actor Fu has traveled all over the world for so many years and rarely encountered difficulties. He was never afraid of anyone, but he never thought in his life that there would be a youth whose tears brought him an unprecedented sense of helplessness.Fu Jinxiao quickly wiped it for him with a tissue paper, \u201cSo, is there anything wrong?\u201dShen Xingsui also noticed that he was crying. He felt so ashamed, he obviously didn\u2019t want to cry. He took the tissue and shook his head quickly, holding back a sob as he replied, \u201cNothing, nothing.\u201dFu Jinxiao looked at him, not knowing what to do to comfort the youth, \u201cI haven\u2019t cried yet, but you cried at my behest, huh?\u201dShen Xingsui was a little sad at first, but he was teased by his humorous smile and burst into tears. He wanted to freely laugh, but he was a little embarrassed. After all, this was a live broadcast, he didn\u2019t want to be laughed at by the audience.Fu Jinxiao got closer and patted him on the shoulder, his voice was softer as he comforted him, \u201cIt\u2019s really all right, this teacher of yours has been traveling all these years. What kind of hardships haven\u2019t I suffered? Compared to those, this is nothing. I tell you, don\u2019t cry or I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dShen Xingsui put down his soaked tissue, raised his head, and looked at him.The young man\u2019s white face was rosy, his black eyes were slightly red from crying, and his red nose was so cute that people wanted to poke it. Those eyes looked watery, like the calm surface of a pond during the autumn. With a puzzled look, like a harmless deer, with a hoarse voice, he really stabbed Fu Jinxiao\u2019s heart, \u201cYou will do what?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dActor Fu cursed in his heart. Out of nowhere, he thought that Shen Xingsui looked so pretty when he cried.He wanted to see it again.But\u2026 definitely not because he was sad.\u2026Shen Xingsui would look amazing if he cried in\u2026 another place.

After all, his face was wiped clean. His tone seemed to be criticizing, but it was more on the line of pampering, \u201cHow old are you? Are you a fragile little lady? Aren\u2019t you afraid of being laughed at by your fans?\u201dShen Xingsui was already ashamed and annoyed, but when he heard him say this, his temper flared and he retorted angrily, \u201cI\u2019m not a crybaby! T-this tears\u2026 uhm, it\u2019s because\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows unexpectedly, \u201cBecause of what?\u201dShen Xingsui lowered his head, trying to divert his attention with the account book in his hand. But under Fu Jinxiao\u2019s scorching gaze, he squirmed and whispered, \u201cBecause I think you\u2019ve worked too hard, so I just\u2026\u201d As he spoke, he felt more and more embarrassed. His voice became softer, until it couldn\u2019t be heard at all.Fu Jinxiao looked at the honest boy in front of him. With a wolfish grin, he teased, \u201cSo you love me?\u201dHe spelled it out loud for the youth.Shen Xingsui was a bit miffed that his feelings were now out in the open, but he was very happy to be understood, so he nodded lightly.Fu Jinxiao sat down opposite him, and glanced at the young man whose skin was sunburned and red, while his forehead was covered with a thin layer of sweat. Today\u2019s sunlight was rather harsh.Normally, Shen Xingsui had a good posture \u2013 mostly as a leftover of his upbringing in the rich Jian family \u2013 but today, he was too tired to keep it up. He slouched, and it only made him look smaller.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you feel sorry for yourself?\u201d Fu Jinxiao poured a glass of water and handed it to him, \u201cThe task assigned to us isn\u2019t that hard, but because the weather is rather bad, it\u2019s not good for your body. I\u2019ll ask the crew to give us extra sunscreen later. Also, don\u2019t forget to check up with a doctor to treat your sunburn, or else it will be painful.\u201dShen Xingsui was still muddle-headed, \u201cHuh? Uhm, sorry?\u201dFu Jinxiao went back to the chair and sat down, opened the meal Shen Xingsui brought over, and said in a slow manner, \u201cNothing. It\u2019s just, I\u2019m so tired right now. Plus, I\u2019m confused as to how to make you realize how hard you\u2019re being on yourself. Thankfully, this teacher of yours isn\u2019t a crybaby, otherwise, I would already cry when I see how you never felt sorry for yourself.\u201dThe actor said this humorously, his tone was full of teasing. This made Shen Xingsui chuckle and laugh, lifting up the atmosphere.But with an uncontrollable grin on his face, Shen Xingsui was finally hit with a realization. What does Actor Fu mean, when he said that \u201cShen Xingsui never felt sorry for himself\u201d?Was this how Fu Jinxiao perceived him?Was this true?Maybe it was just Actor Fu talking casually, just as an example.Shen Xingsui was so overwhelmed that he couldn\u2019t think of an answer. However, it was different with the live broadcast audience. Sometimes, outsiders looking in really could grasp everything clearly.[I see it now!][Ah, Suisui indeed always prioritizes others more.][The most pitiful thing is that no one prioritize him as number one.][Incorrect, Fu-ge clearly cares about him!][Wuwuwuwuwuwuwu quickly lock this pair up!!]As the morning passed, many people got the news that there were idols selling fruits in the farmer\u2019s market here. Some of them were fans, and they had relatively strong economic capabilities..Before the lunch break had passed, a young lady in yellow came to the stall and said, \u201cBoss, how much is this fruit?\u201dShen Xingsui hurriedly walked over to tell the price.The young lady in yellow clothes was generous, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can give me ten catties11 catty = ~600 gram for everything!\u201dShen Xingsui was shocked, \u201cAlthough I am very grateful for your support for our business, are you okay buying this much?\u201dThe little girl in yellow looked shyly at Fu Jinxiao at the back, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. If you really want to thank me, why don\u2019t you just find a way to give me something extra? Maybe a gift?\u201dBecause they heard the rules of the program group, transactions made because of wanting to support the celebrity wasn\u2019t allowed. It\u2019s not easy to directly ask for a photo together. Fu Jinxiao\u2019s fans were on the mature and sensible side, so they knew they had to indirectly ask for extra benefits.Shen Xingsui fell into deep thought, thinking about what could be a gift, \u201cThen I, then we\u2026\u201dJust as he was hesitating, Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice came from behind him. He looked kind and generous, \u201cYou want to give this young lady a gift, yes?\u201dShen Xingsui turned around then nodded at the question.Fu Jinxiao said, \u201cLet Shen Xingchen and Li Xu\u2019an come back and help you pack the fruit together. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201dShen Xingsui didn\u2019t ask him where Fu Jinxiao was going, but only gave him unconditional trust. After answering, he sent a message to Shen Xingchen, and then start helping customers pick fruit together.After a while, Fu Jinxiao left and returned.In Actor Fu\u2019s hand was a pen, inkwell, paper, and inkstone brought from a canteen not far away, spread out on the table behind him. Skillfully, he grinded the inkstone, staining his fingers with specks of black. After the ink was poured into the inkwell, he dipped the pen inside, then started writing on the rice paper. He had powerful strokes, reflecting his noble dignity and charm. On the paper, the words \u201call the best\u201d were written on one neat stroke. His movement was beautiful and the calligraphy work was magnificent.The fans waiting beside him covered her lips excitedly.After Fu Jinxiao put down the brush, he looked up at her and smiled, \u201cAre you okay with this gift?\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d The fans nodded her heads excitedly. She couldn\u2019t hold back her excitement, making her unable to speak steadily, \u201cReally? For me? This is for real?\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded politely. With a polite bow, he added, \u201cThank you for supporting us, thank you for your hard work.\u201dThis was a wordplay.The first phrase was to thank the fan for buying so many fruits, while the latter phrase was to thank her for coming from so far away into this small town.The young lady in yellow almost burst into tears, and she was even a little uncertain, making her stumble over her words, \u201cIt\u2019s not hard, it\u2019s not hard, me, can I ask, this is really for me?\u201dEven though the handsome man was wearing rough clothes that were convenient for work, he still looked so eye-catching. He nodded at the young lady, \u201cReally.\u201dThe lady whispered excitedly, attracting many people \u2013 including Shen Xingsui\u2019s \u2013 attention.Shen Xingsui saw Fu Jinxiao\u2019s calligraphy work for the first time, and asked his older brother, \u201cTeacher Fu\u2019s handwriting is really good?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s only natural. The Fu family is a well-known scholar family, and his father is a calligrapher to boot. He has been influenced since he was a child. You know, the latest work of the Fu patriarch was sold for 80 million in an auction. He\u2019s that good.\u201d Shen Xingchen explained in a low whisper. Then, he continued to speak in a louder voice, \u201cFu-ge himself doesn\u2019t write very often. He doesn\u2019t really have an actual calligraphy piece, per se. But two years ago, a pair of his handwritten words was put up for auction, and the final transaction price was 30 million.\u201dShen Xingsui\u2019s eyes widened, and his mouth gaped in shock.He finally understood why that fan was so excited. Compared to buying dozens of catties of fruit, getting Fu Jinxiao\u2019s calligraphy work was much more beneficial! It should be enough to make a person rich in one night, no exaggeration.The audience in the live broadcast room was also excited:[Why didn\u2019t such a good thing happen to me.][Taohuawu Town right? I will go there tomorrow.][Does this sister saved the galaxy in her last life? She\u2019s so lucky\u2026]There were still a lot of fruits on the table. But after this young lady\u2019s massive purchase, the number went down significantly. On top of that, there was still a long queue behind, some people even lined up from a long time ago, even under the scorching sun.Li Xu\u2019an had a suggestion. \u201cI just contacted Instructor Li and Ranran, and they still have a small part of the flowers that are not sold out.\u201dAfter hearing this, Shen Xingchen also had an idea, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go and buy some of their flowers? Let\u2019s give them to customers who didn\u2019t manage to buy any despite queueing for a long time. Otherwise, if they came up empty-handed, it\u2019ll be too pitiful.\u201dAfter the two of them finished speaking, they both looked at Fu Jinxiao for approval.This was the person in charge of the financial power, without his consent, everything was just empty words.Fu Jinxiao sat at the table to settle the accounts, counting today\u2019s income. \u201cOur fruits are sold at market prices. You two made several mistakes when you wrote down the sales today. I\u2019m positive you forgot to write down a couple of them, so our money and the one written down aren\u2019t the same. With this, you still want to make another expenditure? Can you make sure that we\u2019re making profits now?\u201dLi Xu\u2019an choked, he made one of the miscalculated accounts.Shen Xingchen also held back, but still scratched his head unwillingly. He looked at Shen Xingsui again, hoping that with Shen Xingsui\u2019s backing, the actor would change his mind.Shen Xingsui, who was next to him, looked behind him and found that there were many people queuing up behind them. They must feel really hot. Some people\u2019s backs were soaked after standing for too long. They kept holding their bags to block the sun, waiting very hard.Shen Xingsui tentatively hesitated and said, \u201cIf the remaining flowers from Instructor Li\u2019s side can\u2019t be sold, they will probably be cheaper. If we want to give them away, don\u2019t give them too many. Let\u2019s give them to those who have lined up the longest here. Otherwise, I would be really embarrassed\u2026\u201dLi Xu\u2019an sighed.He wanted to say, \u2018What\u2019s the use of saying that now? Didn\u2019t you hear what Fu-ge said? He refused, so can your words mean anything in front of him?\u2019But Li Xu\u2019an had enough EQ to understand that those words were too rude, so he held back. Instead, he wanted to comfort Shen Xingsui, who would inevitably be refused by the actor.But then, Fu Jinxiao, who was busy correcting the account book, suddenly looked gentle. He nodded at Shen Xingsui\u2019s words, \u201cYou are right.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.??\u201dFu Jinxiao put down the book, and said slowly, \u201cThen do as you said. We will stay here to keep the stalls clean and organized. You and Xingchen will go to Instructor Li to buy some flowers. Make sure you get a discount price.\u201dShen Xingsui smiled, \u201cReally?\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded.Shen Xingchen clenched his fists and jumped excitedly, \u201cYeah! Then let\u2019s go now!\u201dShen Xingsui was also very happy. This pair of brothers were both pure-hearted. Now this matter had been decided, they didn\u2019t procrastinate. They quickly went to the crew to borrow a vehicle, leaving Li Xu\u2019an alone in this mess.The audience was currently busy laughing their asses off:[Hahaha! Judging by Li Xu\u2019an expression, he was definitely questioning his life!][Fu-ge, are you really okay with this?][Once Suisui speaks, Fu-ge immediately agrees!][Fu Jinxiao: my child\u2019s proposal makes sense!][I laughed until my jaw felt sore.]Shen Xingsui was negotiating with the director team about borrowing a small tricycle, but the director team didn\u2019t want them to borrow it for free, and offered the condition: \u201cYou can borrow this tricycle2This one: . It\u2019s 50 yuan for 30 minutes.\u201dShen Xingsui was shocked, \u201cWhy is it so expensive?\u201dShen Xingchen, who grew up as a young master, didn\u2019t feel it was outrageously expensive. He wanted to scan the QR code to pay.Shen Xingsui stopped him and said to the director team, \u201cIt\u2019s really too expensive. I used to ride a shared tricycle for 4 yuan an hour. Why does this electric tricycle cost 50?\u201d The director said earnestly, \u201cNow resources are scarce, we can only give you this price. If you think it\u2019s too expensive, you can ride another one. This one is manual3This one:, and it only costs 10 yuan.\u201dShen Xingsui looked to the side and saw the old tricycle.He wanted to save money, so this was a good offer. Shen Xingsui hesitated for a moment, then nodded, \u201cOkay then!\u201dShen Xingchen was shocked, and stopped his younger brother, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to ride this kind of tricycle.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I know.\u201d Shen Xingsui pulled his older brother to the backseat of the tricycle. He put his feet on the pedals and asked, \u201cAre you seated?\u201dThe young master who always sat behind the luxury car sat on the small bench of the tricycle. The big man shrank aggrievedly.

As promised, I\u2019ll change the posting schedule of this series from April onward. It\u2019s now two chapters per upload, still on Mondays and Thursdays!Also, thank you Candycorns for the ko-fi donation! We have two chapters update today.Next ko-fi donation for bonus chapter (0/2)Shen Xingsui was low-key, so once he pulled an out-of-nowhere skill like this, it was always a delight for the audience to see. The youth looked slender, but he had a surprising amount of physical strength. He easily brought Shen Xingchen along, pedaling at a top speed. It was only when he reached his destination that sweat started to pour in.Shen Xingchen got off the vehicle first, then entered the store, \u201cInstructor Li, we are here to buy flowers!\u201dThe said instructor came as he was called in. He didn\u2019t expect that the customer would be a fellow guest. He put on his usual polite customer service smile.\u201dHow much do you want? Our top flowers each cost 10 yuan.. \u201cShen Xingchen said as he examined the flowers around him, \u201cThis flower is quite beautiful.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I just picked it. Plus, I\u2019ll give you a free packaging service!\u201d Instructor Li sounded very proud of his work. \u201cLet Ranran introduce it to you.\u201dAlthough Shen Xingchen wasn\u2019t the type of person who spends money like breathing air, he never bought flowers by himself. He didn\u2019t know the correct price for this kind of item.\u00a0 Anran\u2019s introduction was very positive, \u201cThis kind of rose costs 10 yuan a piece. While this one is more expensive, and it costs 15.\u201dShen Xingsui came from behind, and after looking at the flowers, he said softly:,\u201dRanran, give us this kind of common rose. If we buy 50 of them, can we get it for a cheaper price?\u201dAnran didn\u2019t know how to properly respond to this offer, \u201cThis price is not expensive.\u201d\u201cBut we buy a lot at once.\u201d Shen Xingsui bent down to look at the flowers as if he was bargaining in the vegetable market. He said as he pointed to each flower, \u201cLook, this flower is a bit wilted, so the price should be lower. And as for this one, it\u2019s obviously much smaller than the others, so it\u2019s not appropriate to sell it at the same price.\u201dAnran was actually choked by his words. He couldn\u2019t refute this, so he had to relent, \u201cOkay, okay, I will give you a discount.\u201dShen Xingsui was satisfied now. He smiled politely. \u201cThank you.\u201dAfter helping Shen Xingsui to place the flowers on the tricycle\u2019s compartment, Shen Xingchen felt it was fair for him to be the one who pedaled this time. His younger brother must\u2019ve been tired. \u201cI\u2019ll pedal this time, \u2018kay?\u201dShen Xingsui looked at him hesitantly and said, \u201cCan you?\u201cYou look down on me!\u201d Shen Xingchen patted his chest, \u201cHeh, do you think this will be difficult for me?\u201dFacts have proved that although Shen Xingchen sometimes has a simple head, he has a good learning ability. He really knew how to pedal a tricycle.However, when they arrived at their fruit stall, both of their energies had been drained dry. They were even too tired to stand up straight.The audience also have different opinions on Shen Xingsui\u2019s behavior:[He\u2019s too stingy.][Small-hearted.][Hey, I think Ranran\u2019s temperament is far from good also.][Xingsui, are you short of money?][Mr. Li\u2019s team must be so tired, and compared to Xingsui\u2019s team, they didn\u2019t make much money today. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s only fair to purchase them at the given price?]When the flowers arrived, they distributed all the flowers, because all the fruits in the stall had been sold. As for the grandpa supplier, he actually was around during this time. Never in his wildest dream his fruits could all be sold out like this. This was the first time in his life he saw this empty stall.He wasn\u2019t dreaming, was he?Fu Jinxiao handed over the recorded account to him, and said, \u201cToday\u2019s total turnover is here, about 6213 yuan1about 900 USD. That\u2019s like, my university semester tuition.. You can collect the account, and later our program team will withdraw the cash from the bank and send it to you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 so much?\u201d The old man took the account book with his rough hand, all dirty and full of calluses from working all year around. It was still trembling as he carefully ran over his finger on the book. \u201c\u201dThank you, thank you so much, young man. I can\u2019t take all the money, you sell things for me, I\u2019ll give you half of this\u2026\u201dShen Xingchen gave the old man a reassuring smile. \u201cIt\u2019s okay grandpa, this is all voluntary work for us. Besides, this was actually a task assigned by a program director, and we are paid salary for doing this! In fact, you are already doing a favor by lending us the fruits to sell!\u201dThe old man didn\u2019t know much about program directors or tasks.He was very stubborn, though. He still took out a piece of cloth from his pocket. The cloth looked very worn out. He carefully opened the folded cloth one by one, revealing the money inside. There were two 100 yuan bills. He took it out tremblingly, and what left him was 5 yuan, 10 yuan, and a few scattered coins. They all looked old and worn out.He put the 100 yuan bill into Fu Jinxiao\u2019s hand, and then lowered his head to get the smaller 5 yuan and 10 yuan bills. His voice was quiet but full of sincerity, \u201cThis is what I saved from selling my harvest. You take this money as a payment first, and for the rest, I\u2019ll give you later when the money arrives today.\u201dThe old man has no savings in banks. All he had was 215 yuan2about 31 USD\u2026 cash.For many people, this amount was just pocket change. The money you recharge for your game account to buy that character skin you like. But for this grandpa, this \u201cinsignificant\u201d amount was their whole life savings.Shen Xingsui handed over the money to the old man, and said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we don\u2019t need this money. The director will pay us a salary, and you already paid us by your service.\u201dThe grandpa hesitated, \u201cI just\u2026 don\u2019t really understand. But, you mean that you already got your pay?\u201dFu Jinxiao smiled gently. \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct. This money is what you deserve. No need to worry about us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Shen Xingsui carefully helped the old man put the money back into the cloth pouch and folded it carefully. His movements were careful and his voice was gentle. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot now, you can wear a sun hat or something when you go out. I checked it just now, a sun hat sold in that store is on sale recently. It\u2019s 20 yuan now. And, you usually walk a lot, so you should change those shoes\u2026\u201dThe old man was quietly listening carefully. All of his children were all working in the city, and they only see him once a year. Listening to this young man\u2019s gentle instructions reminded him of his children and grandchildren. He nodded while his eyes slowly turned red.Standing in this sunlight, the old man\u2019s back was slouching, framing a very lonely figure.The audience in the live broadcast room were deeply moved:[There are really too many sufferings in this world.][\u201cXingsui, stop being stingy\u201d?, now it\u2019s clear that Suisui saves that money because it\u2019s for that grandpa.][Truly, only people who have lived a hard life will understand.][He just wants to save some money so that grandpa can buy more things. Instead, he was criticized for being petty. Please, stop running your mouth before you understand the full story.]The next day\u2014Everyone gathered in the courtyard early in the morning, and the director team began to count yesterday\u2019s results. In the end, Fu Jinxiao\u2019s team of four surpassed the other team by at least 500 yuan. They were the first place finishers.The staff brought three password boxes and said, \u201cCongratulations on completing yesterday\u2019s task on time and reaching the target. These three password boxes contain clues about the assassin and your mission. Everyone can open the box and get the hint card.\u201dShen Xingchen took the box and said, \u201cWhere\u2019s the password?\u201dThe director team began to do their usual inhumane operations, \u201cThe password is the number of breakfast items that appeared on the dining table yesterday, plus the combined number of you and your teammates\u2019 chosen breakfast items. If you combine them, it\u2019s the password. On top of that, only the guests who know the password could get the hint cards.\u201d\u201c????\u201dQuestion marks might as well have popped up on top of the four men\u2019s heads. They stared at the staff in pure disbelief.Shen Xingchen held back for a long time, and choked out a sentence, \u201cDirector, are you kidding me?\u201dThe number of barrages in live broadcast rooms doubled:[Hahahahahaha!][I knew it! This director is too foxy to give them \u201cfree\u201d breakfast! They really use that for passwords!][God, I\u2019m rolling on my bed, laughing until I wheezed.][I got the hint card, but this is not that different from not getting it.]Just when everyone was dumbfounded, Shen Xingsui stepped forward silently and said, \u201cI think I remember.\u201d\u201c?\u201d Everyone looked at him in unison.Being stared at like this, Shen Xingsui smiled shyly and said, \u201cMy memory is not bad. I remembered the total quantity because I had difficulty choosing them. There should be 12 breakfast items, right?\u201dThe staff nodded. \u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201d The guests\u2019 eyes widened.Shen Xingchen leaned over and said, \u201cBut it\u2019s useless for you to only remember that. We also need to combine the number of items we chose right? Do you remember Fu-ge\u2019s?\u201dFu Jinxiao opened his lips: \u201cOur combined total should be 16.\u201dThe staff quickly nodded again. \u201cCorrect.\u201dShen Xingchen: \u201c\u2026?\u201dThe director team took two password boxes and handed them to Fu Jinxiao and Shen Xingsui. \u201cCongratulations, you have completed the test. These two boxes belong to you.\u201dShen Xingchen next to him was stunned, he seemed to be screaming inside like an insane person. \u2018Did you cheat?? Did you actually get a secret script?? Damn you! How on earth do you remember the number of breakfasts!! Foul!\u2019Li Xu\u2019an could only be silent.These two reactions greatly amused the audiences:[What kind of treasure program is this hahaha.][Fu-ge and Suisui are too strong!][Baby Xingchen, I\u2019ll light you some candles.][I\u2019ll screenshot Li Xu\u2019an\u2019s speechless expression for later usage~]The staff probably could sense the visible murder intent and couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. They finally decided to spare these two. \u201cActually, it doesn\u2019t matter if you really forget. Because you have completed the sales task, we can make an exception and give you two this last password box.\u201dShen Xingchen was about to breathe a sigh of relief when he heard the director added, \u201cHowever, you two won\u2019t get your breakfast today.\u201dThe young master felt like he was being choked to death. By his own irritation.Other guests decided to participate this a little bit of schadenfreude:\u201cXingchen, you can be content, at least you have one box.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, we don\u2019t have breakfast either.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s starve together, dear comrade.\u201dShen Xingchen just thought of protesting. Who knew that the director took out another mobile phone and slyly said, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter. Now we will add a challenge. It is 5:30 in the morning. Please call your family and ask if they would help you by coming here to Taohuawu Town and bringing breakfast. If they agree, you will get the breakfast we provided. If they refuse, then you can continue going hungry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis dog director!Numb expressions almost appeared on everyone\u2019s faces.But there were still people who were happy. Instructor Li tried to be positive as he said, \u201cOkay, at least we got a chance! At least it is better than nothing.\u201d\u201cBring me my phone.\u201dThe staff had long been used to this young master\u2019s temper, so they quickly handed him the mobile phone, but then repeated the rules. \u201cIt must be your own family.\u201dShen Xingchen nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201dThe young master dialed the phone confidently. He decided to dial Shen Minglang\u2019s number first. After the phone rang for a while, it was finally picked up. The eldest Shen brother answered with a rough, hushed voice, \u201cHello?\u201dShen Xingchen spoke quickly, \u201cHello, ge, it\u2019s Xingchen.\u201dShen Minglang: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m participating in a show, so\u2026 can you come here and bring me breakfast?\u201dShen Xingchen had a smile on his face.Shen Minglang was silent for a long time. Then, he answered with a gloomy and terrifying voice, \u201cI had a scheduled meeting all night yesterday, and I just fell asleep for less than an hour. Shen Xingchen, are you itchy for a spanking?\u201dShen Xingchen: \u201cHey\u2026 That\u2019s not\u2013\u201dThe call was hung up with a click.The cold wind blowing in the yard. It felt desolate.The other guests couldn\u2019t hold back their laughter. While Shen Xingchen looked at the director and said, \u201cDirector, this doesn\u2019t count, can you let me\u00a0 make another call?\u201dHow dare the director say no.If this young master got angry, no one could stop him.Shen Xingchen quickly made another call to his mother \u2013 his family member with the best temper. After dialing the phone for a while, Xu Enzhen\u2019s voice sounded over the phone, soft and gentle, \u201cHello?\u201dShen Xingchen answered, \u201cMom, it\u2019s me, Xingchen.\u201d\u201cShen Xingchen?\u201d As soon as Xu Enzhen heard that it was his son, a slightly pungent voice came out, \u201cWhat are you doing up until five o\u2019clock in the morning? Don\u2019t tell me you are having nightmares!\u201dShen Xingchen: \u201c\u2026No! I\u2019m recording a show, can you come over and bring me breakfast?\u201dXu Enzhen fell silent. She then subconsciously answered, \u201cBreakfast? I\u2019ll give you a slap, do you want it?\u201dShen Xingchen wanted to cry but had no tears, \u201d Mom, I\u2019m serious!\u201dHowever, the audience in the live broadcast room were all amused:[Hahaha, it\u2019s so funny.][So this young master\u2019s family is so funny?][Though, it\u2019s clear they still love him despite their words. The eldest Shen brother stayed up all night, but he still answered the phone when he saw it was his di. His mother was also still sleepy, but she still answered it, and didn\u2019t hang up after talking about the breakfast thing. Maybe she was thinking about whether or not letting him suffer a bit of hardship, hahaha!][Yes, yes, it\u2019s a really enviable familial relationship.]Shen Xingchen argued with Xu Enzhen for a long time, but in the end, his mother reluctantly and perfunctorily agreed to the request for breakfast, which was regarded as a reluctant pass.The director team looked at Shen Xingsui and the others next to him and asked, \u201cAre you guys going to call?\u201dShen Xingsui was a little surprised. \u201cWe can call too? Haven\u2019t we already cleared the task and cracked the password box?\u201d\u201cFor fairness\u2019 sake, we\u2019ll give everyone a chance.\u201d The director was mostly a very fair person. \u201cIf you call and get a yes, you can get a chance to ask our staff for help later.\u201dAfter hearing this, Fu Jinxiao thought it was okay to try. He nodded to the offer. \u201cLet us try then.\u201dShen Xingsui hesitated for a moment, and agreed.Shen Xingchen handed the mobile phone to Shen Xingsui and said, \u201cHere, then you can call your mother. If you get beaten by your brother, then it will prove that he\u2019s the most fiercest and rudest.\u201dMost of the people present, including netizens, didn\u2019t know whether Shen Xingsui had already been recognized by his birth family. They were all curious about their identity. However, after hearing what Shen Xingchen said, they felt very strange.When they saw that Shen Xingsui was about to make a call, they became very excited. They wanted to know the truth![Arghhh I can\u2019t wait!][Think about the Zhang couple before, no matter what activities there are in \u201cStarlight\u201d, they didn\u2019t care about him. So miserable\u2026][I hope his biological family treats him well!]After Shen Xingsui got the phone, he hesitated for a moment, and still dialed the number. He waited for a while, because it was the same number, and Xu Enzhen came from the other end with an annoyed voice. \u201cDidn\u2019t I agree just now? What\u2019s more you want? Shen Xingchen, do you want a beating or what? What time is it? Even if I bring you breakfast, I have to wait until dawn\u2026\u201dShen Xingsui hesitated. After a while, he cautiously said, \u201cMom, it\u2019s me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was a suspicious silence on the other end of the call.Everyone was also holding their breath, not daring to disturb this scene.However, the barrage exploded:[What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s the situation?][Did I hear it wrong?][Wait, isn\u2019t that the same number??][Sisters, I\u2019m so excited!][It\u2019s this early in the morning, but I\u2019m no longer sleepy!]1about 900 USD.

He couldn\u2019t be as natural as Shen Xingchen. When calling at this time, he was worried that his mother would be disturbed, and that she would be annoyed. It was\u2026 a kind of subconscious fear of him.There was silence on the other end of the phone for a long time, and then Xu Enzhen\u2019s voice sounded again, completely different from the impatient tone just now, smiling and gentle: \u201cIs it Suisui?\u201dShen Xingsui responded softly.\u201cIt\u2019s really you, Suisui. Mom thought she heard it wrong. Why did you wake up so early?\u201d Xu Enzhen proactively asked in a doting tone, \u201cHave you had breakfast?\u201dShen Xingsui replied honestly, \u201cNo.\u201dAfter hesitating for a while, now seemed to be a better time to ask.Shen Xingsui held the phone, licked his lips, and asked boldly, \u201cWell, Mom, I\u2019m indeed recording a show. Actually, I want to ask, can you\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, Xu Enzhen had already taken the lead, \u201cRecording the show so early and not having breakfast?\u00a0 How can this be okay for your body? The director is so shameful! Don\u2019t be afraid Suisui, just say what you want to eat. Mom will go to the plane now and take your breakfast there.\u201d\u201c\u2026.?\u201dWhile Shen Xingsui hoped that his mother would agree, he didn\u2019t expect that his mother seemed to take it so seriously. He was afraid his mother would really board a plane right now, so he had to set the records straight. \u201cWell, uhm, Mom. Actually, it\u2019s fine, really. No need to do that! It\u2019s still before dawn, so you should continue to sleep. Plus, you still need to book a plane ticket, and travelling will take too much time. I\u2019m really fine, the program crew will provide me with meals.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of air ticket? We have a private jet at home.\u201d Xu Enzhen said boldly, \u201cMom is not sleepy, she usually gets up at this time!\u201dShen Xingchen, who was next to his brother: \u201c??\u201dHis confused expression and widened eyes seemed to put the word doubt directly on his forehead.The audience in the live broadcast loved this kind of hilarious scene:[My tummy hurts! I\u2019m still rolling on the floor!!][(Shen Xingchen, are you itchy for a spanking? It\u2019s so early in the morning that you don\u2019t let people sleep) vs. (Mom is not sleepy, she usually wakes up at this time)][(Breakfast? I\u2019ll give you a slap, do you want it?) vs. (Don\u2019t be afraid Suisui, just say what you want to eat.)][Hahahaha, the double-standards!!][What kind of tragedy is this?][Although the main point should be that these two seem to be biological brothers, but sisters, I really just want to laugh hahaha.]Shen Xingsui felt sorry for his mother, and just as he was about to say something, he didn\u2019t expect Xu Enzhen to get up and knock on Shen Minglang\u2019s room. Then, she immediately woke him up and asked about his private jet.The still-sleepy Shen Minglang heard that his mother wanted to go to Taohuawu Town, and said impatiently: \u201cShen Xingchen won\u2019t starve to death, Mom, you\u2019re making too much of a fuss.\u201dXu Enzhen pointed to the phone and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not him, it\u2019s Suisui.\u201d\u201cSuisui?\u201d Shen Minglang\u2019s tone changed, and after a while of silence, he said, \u201cIf you transfer the plane to go there now, you can arrive at noon at the earliest.\u201dShen Xingchen: \u201c???\u201dHe widened his eyes and stared at the phone.The audience in the live broadcast room were even happier:[Hahaha! Is Xingchen a stray dog you pick up or something?][LaughingCrazily.jpg][The Young Master\u2019s status in the family is in crisis!][Hahahaha, the double-standard scene of a rick family!]Shen Xingsui said in a panic, \u201cNo! Mom, Dage, listen to me. This is what the director tasked me to do. Thank you for agreeing, I\u2019ve passed the task now. So I can have breakfast later.\u201dXu Enzhen\u2019s voice seemed to be a little regretful after hearing this: \u201cIs that so?\u201dShen Xingsui responded softly. There was a gentle smile in his eyes. He was very grateful for their enthusiasm for wanting to give him the best. \u201cThat\u2019s right, thank you Mom.\u201dShen Minglang coughed lightly beside the phone, as if he was about to say something along the lines of \u2018my sense of presence is negligible, huh\u2019. He purposefully made his voice louder as he said, \u201cCall home in time if you encounter any problems during the recording of the program over there.\u201dThe smile in Shen Xingsui\u2019s eyes deepened, and he responded with a crisp voice, \u201cUnderstood, thank you, Dage.\u201dThe phone conversation ended with a hang-up tone. The surrounding area was still very quiet, and everyone seemed to look at him with deep meaning. That kind of look was very complicated, but there was no hostility.Shen Xingchen was the first to jump: \u201cSuisui, don\u2019t listen to the nonsense of Mom and Dage, that plane will arrive at night at the earliest, so breakfast will not be delivered at all!\u201dShen Xingsui: \u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cReally, will I lie to you?\u201d Shen Xingchen grabbed Shen Xingsui\u2019s shoulder, \u201cSo I\u2019m the one you can rely on at critical moments! Don\u2019t count on their smooth talk!\u201dShen Xingsui stopped and moved closer to him when he heard this. In the end, he could only nod in an absent-minded fashion.The development was unexpected. It was peak comedy for the audience.[I thought he would get angry, but instead he started fighting for Suisui\u2019s favor.][Shen Xingchen, why are you like this!][So he\u2019s really Suisui\u2019s Erge?][Hahaha, I remembered yesterday that you netizens laughed at him for being stingy and petty! And he proved you all he can inherit tens of billions of wealth from a wealthy family while you can\u2019t~][Suisui, you hide it so deeply!]Shen Xingsui hesitated for a moment, and then asked, \u201cThat\u2026the mobile phone?\u201dFu Jinxiao stretched out his hand and said, \u201cGive it to me.\u201dShen Xingsui obediently handed it to the actor.Fu Jinxiao also thought it over carefully about who to call. His father was away for a business trip so he didn\u2019t want to bother him. Both of his maternal and paternal grandparents shouldn\u2019t be woken up at this time, so he wouldn\u2019t disturb them. After much deliberation, he finally called Li Na.After the call was connected, Li Na\u2019s threatening voice came from the other side. With was quite frightening, \u201cYou better call at this hour because of something important, this is my golden beauty sleep time!\u201dFu Jinxiao immediately smiled, \u201cI\u2019m recording for a reality show.\u201d\u201cA reality show?\u201d Li Na was stunned. After a brief moment of silence, she changed to a sweet voice, \u201cAh, hello for all the audience~ I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t mind me just now, hehe~\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast room couldn\u2019t help laughing:[My mother-in-law is so cute!][Oh dear, another delusional one has joined in the ranks.][Hahahaha, I finally know who gave Fu-ge\u2018s face-changing speed.]Fu Jinxiao has gotten used to his mother\u2019s personality, and so he went straight to the point:, \u201cI\u2019m recording a show, but the show crew doesn\u2019t give me food. Can you come over and bring me breakfast?\u201d\u201cBreakfast?\u201d Li Na complained in reflex, \u201cWhich program group dare not give you food? Are you teasing your old lady?\u201dFu Jinxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201dLi Na finally fully woken up, and she remembered something, \u201cWait, you\u2019re recording \u2018Bright Stars\u2019 right? I remember that Suisui should be there. Is he with you?\u201dFu Jinxiao glanced at Shen Xingsui, who was in front of him, \u201cMm. Yes.\u201d\u201cHave Suisui eat?\u201d Li Na sighed as she complained, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for Suisui, but he can\u2019t be hungry. He\u2019s not in good health. Does your program team really not give you food? Ask Suisui what he likes to eat. I\u2019ll send it over. I\u2019ll just take our family\u2019s private plane so I\u2019ll arrive soon.\u201dFu Jinxiao was rarely silent. This time he was completely speechless.Shen Xingsui who heard this furiously blushed. He couldn\u2019t hold back, and said softly, \u201cAuntie, don\u2019t worry, I already have breakfast.\u201dLi Na was relieved, \u201cYou and Xingchen have eaten then? Then that\u2019s good. Auntie can rest assured!\u201dFu Jinxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe melon-eaters in the live broadcast room this morning were blown away:[Hahaha, I didn\u2019t expect there to be such a sequel to this development!][Why does Fu-ge\u2018s mother care about Suisui and Xingchen?][Upstairs, I heard that the relationship between the two families has always been very good!][I really laughed until my jaw fell off.][Our Suisui is really the favorite of the group!]Of course, some more sensitive viewers and fans sniffed out something:[Auntie\u2019s tone, I always feel like she is treating Suisui like\u2026 you know, her prospective daughter-in-law?][Yes, yes, yes!][Don\u2019t think too much, just take it as-is.][Plus, she mentioned Xingchen too.][I hope it was that way but\u2026]In the end, since Li Na agreed to Fu Jinxiao\u2019s request, he was declared as passing the task. Then the phone was passed to the next person, which was Anran.Because of this hilarious phone call event, the popularity of the live broadcast room reached 350 million cumulative online users for the first time at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning. This was an unprecedented number, to the point it paralyzed the barrage screen. The sun hasn\u2019t risen, and yet, several hot searches have already been posted:#ShenXingsuiIsReallyFromShenFamily##FamilialDoubleStandards##ShenXingchen\u2019sREALCompetition##FutureMomIsVeryHappy#In just one hour, all the top searches were dominated by \u201cBright Stars\u201d. This reality show has truly been at the forefront of popularity since it started airing. And now, as more and more people wake up, the ratings of the program are still rising, and more and more viewers are participating in the discussion.After Anran got the phone, he dialed his father\u2019s number, and Jian Kuo answered.Jian Kuo\u2019s voice in the morning was also a little impatient, \u201cHey, Ranran, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dAnran tentatively said: \u201cDad, I\u2019m recording a show. I haven\u2019t had breakfast yet. Can you come and bring me breakfast?\u201d\u201cBreakfast?\u201d Jian Kuo hesitated for a moment, a little suspicious of the situation, \u201cIsn\u2019t this something the crew arranged for you?\u201dAnran responded, his voice was soft and fragile, the kind that would make people feel pity just by hearing it, \u201cDad, can you send it to me?\u201dJian Kuo was silent for a moment, and just when everyone thought he would agree, he said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll ask my driver to go to the airport now. I\u2019ll buy the plane ticket.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAnran twitched his lips uncontrollably for a moment.Not only him, but others also pursed their lips and smiled, with a hint of malicious fun and\u00a0 sarcasm.We all know how high-profile Anran and the Jian family used to be, especially Jian Zhi, who was also in the entertainment circle. When \u201cStarlight\u201d was being recorded, everyone in the training camp envied Anran, and the whole network was also blowing how much the Jian family loves this child. But today, the comparison only made it look\u2026 fake.Some people in the live broadcast room couldn\u2019t help being amused:[One of them was directly delivered by a private jet, and the other wanted to buy a plane ticket.][Hahaha, one of them will come immediately, while the other will assign a driver to do the job.][Wait, isn\u2019t the Jian family also rich?][Rich families are also divided into grades. As someone who understands a little bit, I can say responsibly that the Jian family is indeed no match for the Shen\u2019s and Fu\u2019s.][Hahaha, although they both agreed, but I think Anran lost in comparison.]The guests finished calling their relatives. In summary, basically they all pass the task.The director asked the staff to bring breakfast over, but the richness of the breakfast was divided into grades. For example, Shen Xingsui and Fu Jinxiao, who guessed the password, got a luxurious breakfast, which was very rich. There were a variety of choices such as delicate xiaolongbao, steamed bun dumplings, various crepes and pancakes.In comparison, all Shen Xingchen had for breakfast was a bowl of millet porridge served with two flatbreads and a small bowl of pickles.When eating, Shen Xingchen sat at a table not far away. Shen Xingsui took a few things from his own table and said softly, \u201cLet\u2019s eat together.\u201dShen Xingchen bit his flatbread in surprise, \u201cDidn\u2019t the director forbid you from sharing your breakfast?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Xingsui smiled at him a little slyly, and lowered his voice, \u201cIf we eat half of both our portions, it\u2019s not considered a gift, at most it\u2019s called equal share.\u201dShen Xingchen smiled and nodded Shen Xingsui, \u201cYou kid, you have learned a lot recently!\u201dShen Xingsui put the noodle soup he brought in front of his brother, and put the meat and chicken legs in front of him. \u201cEat quickly, you didn\u2019t eat well yesterday.\u201dShen Xingchen was really hungry, so he immediately threw down the millet porridge and started eating noodles.Shen Xingsui next to him was eating steamed stuffed buns in small bites. Finally, when Shen Xingchen finished eating half of his bowl, he belatedly reacted, \u201cWhere\u2019s your portion of meat? You don\u2019t want to eat it?\u201d\u201cI ate it too.\u201d Shen Xingsui handed him the meat bun, \u201cThis one also has meat in it.\u201dShen Xingchen took a closer look with squinty eyes. No matter how much meat there was in the bun, it was just a small portion. How could it be compared with chicken drumsticks? As he was thinking, he suddenly remembered a scene like this in the past.Shen Xingsui had always cared for him. No matter what it was, be it staying up all night and squatting in the training room to help him guard the door and time. In the dormitory, points would always be deducted for beds and quilts, so Shen Xingsui was always the one paying, silently helping him deal with the aftermath of his reckless points spending.Shen Xingchen pursed his lips, raised his hedgehog head proudly, and hummed, \u201cI will definitely complete the task and win the victory at noon today, and then I will take you to eat two chicken legs.\u201dShen Xingsui smiled softly and nodded. \u201cOkay, you are the best.\u201dShen Xingchen was dissatisfied: \u201cWhat are you calling me again? You\u2019re younger and I\u2019m older. Call me ge!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChildish.Although Shen Xingsui complained in his heart, he still spoiled him, and called softly: \u201cGe.\u201dShen Xingchen showed a bright smile, but still glanced at the camera, as if he wanted to brag to his mother and elder brother. Like fighting for favor, he cleared his throat and said: \u201cOkay, since you recognize me as the boss so sincerely, I will definitely take you to eat as much as you want in the future!\u201dShen Xingsui didn\u2019t know what to say, \u201cThank you then.\u201dOnly then was Shen Xingchen satisfied and continued eating.The audience in the live broadcast room were amused and moved after witnessing the whole process:[Actually, I was worried that the double-standard scene would make Xingchen feel uncomfortable.][But Suisui is really an angel, he is so kind.][Thank you Suisui for taking care of our Chen-ge\u2018s feelings, I really became your fan!][These two brothers are so touching\u2026]If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Enjoy the 11 chapters update for today and tomorrow~Next ko-fi donation goals for bonus chapter (1/2)Not long after, Shen Xingsui and Fu Jinxiao got together to open their password box at the same time.They both were the two people who obtained the most hint cards. And for this round they got:[He has always been an artistic person, and popular with everyone.][He hated water since he was a child, especially the pond in the backyard]Shen Xingsui held two cards and fell into deep thought, trying to narrow his suspects down. \u201cHm\u2026 these two hints are still too broad. For example, all of us are either idols or actors, so we can be considered as having artistic talents and popular with the masses.\u201d\u201cAfraid of water?\u201d Fu Jinxiao pointed to the hint card as he said, \u201cBoth Mr. Li and Tuya can swim. In fact, Mr. Li is quite good at it.\u201dShen Xingsui thought for a while and said, \u201cMy brother can also swim.\u201dThe coverage of this hint card is much smaller, maybe they could narrow it down to people who couldn\u2019t swim. But\u2026 who else?Just as he was thinking, there was a knock on the door.Shen Xingsui turned around and invited them in, \u201cPlease come in.\u201dIt was Shen Xingchen who came in, and he said, \u201cI only have a few hint cards. But I swear I\u2019m not the assassin, so let\u2019s share our information?\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cHow could we know you\u2019re not lying?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really not the assassin!\u201d Shen Xingchen yelled as if he was wronged. To prove his innocence, he said, \u201cI also have my hint card in my hand. If you don\u2019t believe me, I will hand over my card as a guarantee! Plus, I know the content will definitely help you!\u201dShen Xingsui hesitated for a moment, then looked at Fu Jinxiao.Fu Jinxiao sat lazily on the chair, raised his chin: \u201cTake a look.\u201dShen Xingchen took out the card, and everyone saw the words written on the hint card: [The young master has been in poor health since he was a child. I hope he can spend his life in peace and freedom]Although this hint card was also vague, it did give another precious idea.Shen Xingchen said, \u201cCould it be that this assassin was sick during his childhood?\u201dShen Xingchen rubbed his head in distress, \u201cWho the hell is this? I feel that the range is too wide. These broken hint cards are ambiguous and useless at all. They are so limited.\u201dWhen Shen Xingchen was yelling, Fu Jinxiao didn\u2019t answer him. Instead, he played around with the hint card as his mind turned its cogs. Then, he smiled.Seeing his expression, Shen Xingchen asked, \u201cFu-ge, do you already know who it is?\u201dShen Xingsui looked at Fu Jinxiao in shock, feeling that it was impossible \u2013 those hints are too vague, how could it be guessed so quickly?Fu Jinxiao put the card down, stood up and stretched, and said slowly, \u201cI\u2019ve probably already known who this is.\u201d\u201c???\u201d The two Shen brothers said in unison, \u201cWho??\u201dFu Jinxiao picked up the hint card and the mission card, then he smiled mysteriously at the two young men. With a slow drawl, he said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll make sure of my guess today.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2018If you don\u2019t want to tell us then don\u2019t lead us on!\u2019Now Shen Xingsui finally understands the meaning of Shen Xingchen\u2019s words of \u201cFu Jinxiao will never lose\u201d.It is no wonder why people with no fear would tremble in front of Fu Jinxiao. This man is simply too scary. Only fools would want to make an enemy of him!The discussion session in the morning is over, and today the program team has started to assign new tasks.Instead of wandering around the town, they actually left Taohuawu Town today. They came to the foot of the mountain not far away from the town, to a small old school there. The name of this school was Panwang Primary School.The director casually said, \u201cThis town is located in a remote location, so the economy and transportation here are not very developed. There are several small villages on this mountain, and the children living in those villages will come here to go to school. This school was actually built thanks to a kind entrepreneur\u2019s donation more than a decade ago. Thanks to them, all children here can study freely and healthily!\u201dAs the camera shifted, people could squint to see the name of the donating organization.The live broadcast netizens have a zoom-in feature, so they have already discovered something.[Xingyue Group!][This is the company of the Shen family!][Hope Primary School\u2026][Oh yeah, it\u2019s donated in the name of the Shen family\u2019s dead son right?][According to known information, the Shen family didn\u2019t just donate to one primary school, and such Hope Primary Schools are located in almost every province and town!]It was because of this dead son, the Shen family began to hope all children across the nation can enjoy a good education at the least. Mainly it was because they have a hope in their heart \u2013 if their son was still alive somewhere\u2026 they hope he can have a proper education for his future. That\u2019s why they built all sorts of schools in every corner of the country.The staff led everyone into the school and announced the rules for today\u2019s tasks: \u201cEveryone will draw lots in this box today, and the tasks drawn by the lottery determine what you will do today. There are teachers, janitors, canteen workers, security guards, and such. You need to do your job well, or you will lose points! Also, if your job is particularly excellent, you\u2019ll be rewarded with extra points. The winner is the person with the most points, of course.\u201d\u201cIn addition,\u201d The director added, \u201cThere are several hint cards inside treasure boxes hidden all over the school. You can go and find it. Today is the third day, and the assassin has the means to kill you. Please find him as soon as possible and protect the prince and yourself!\u201dAfter the announcement, everyone began to draw lots.Shen Xingsui was a janitor, Fu Jinxiao was\u00a0 a teacher, Shen Xingchen, a young master who never worked in a kitchen, actually got the job as a canteen worker. Ning Ze was a security guard, Tuya was a gardener\u2026 and such, and such.Then, the task started.Shen Xingsui got the cleaning tools for sweeping and mopping the floor, and he had to work in empty classrooms and the corridors. While Fu Jinxiao got the textbooks, and went to teach in the third grade class. There were exclamations and screams, and smiles appeared on their faces. The children here are all relatively simple in appearance, but they all have a kind of cuteness. When they see big stars, their eyes are shining bright, absolutely starstruck.Fu Jinxiao stood on the podium and made a gesture for them to be silent.Although he has never been a teacher, Actor Fu did not have the slightest stage fright. He stood at the top, with a refined smile on his face, and talked slowly, \u201cPlease keep quiet in class. I will introduce myself first. My surname is Fu, you can call me Teacher Fu, since this is the first time we meet, but let\u2019s get to know each other first.\u201dThe children replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time we met~\u201dFu Jinxiao looked very patient, and he agreed to play along, \u201cWhen did you see me?\u201d\u201cInside the TV!\u201d\u201cOn the grocery bag where we eat at home.\u201d\u201cOn the wall of the canteen\u2026\u201dThese honest answers made people laugh. The netizens in the live broadcast room were also amused, these children are really honest and cute.Another little boy patted his chest and said, \u201cI\u2019m still your fan! The God of War you played before is very handsome. When I grow up, I want to be like you. I want to be a hero and defeat those bad guys!\u201dWell, the children\u2019s wishes have always been very simple.It was just a sci-fi movie, and there really weren\u2019t any heroes with such superpowers at all.Fu Jinxiao hooked his lips up and did not destroy his dream, \u201cGood ambition! Work hard, and it will come true in the future.\u201dBecause of his approachability, the children who were originally nervous and timid let go a lot. The little boy pointed to her deskmate, smiling as he said, \u201cShe\u2019s your fan too!\u201dFu Jinxiao lowered his head unexpectedly, half-jokingly: \u201cIs your dream also to be a superhero?\u201dThe little girl shook her head shyly.The little boy next to him laughed sullenly, and said, \u201cShe is not. Her dream is to grow up and marry you as your bride!\u201dAfter hearing this, the whole class roared with laughter.The little girl was even shyer than before. Her face was flushed, but she didn\u2019t retort. She just timidly looked at the tall and handsome man in front of her, and at her idol.Only Fu Jinxiao didn\u2019t laugh at him, the man just looked at him calmly, then bent down slightly, and said in a gentle voice, \u201cIt\u2019s good to have ideals, but you are still too young to be a bride.\u201dThe little girl was a little disappointed. Her small mouth pursed down, but she still responded obediently.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dWhen she didn\u2019t expect, Fu Jinxiao actually had something else to say. She raised her head in hope, and met the man\u2019s amorous sharp eyes. There was a faint smile on his face, and he spoke slowly. \u201cThis teacher already has a bride he likes, so I can\u2019t marry you.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201d The little girl\u2019s eyes widened in shock.Not only her, but the cameramen and all the netizens in the live broadcast room were also in total disbelief.[Wait, did I hear it wrong???][There\u2019s someone you like?!][You are lying! Are you just saying that to make the little girl feel at ease?][Who is so capable of getting Fu Jinxiao?][Let me see who is the bride who saved the galaxy in her previous life.][Ahhh, it\u2019s so early in the morning, why did this suddenly explode? I\u2019m not sleepy anymore!!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Occasionally he would be caught by the media, but he would soon clarify whether it\u2019s not true or just marketing. Even if there\u2019s no such clarification, when Actor Fu was interviewed, he would always give an affirmative answer: \u201cIt\u2019s just a friend.\u201dHe has always been a person who didn\u2019t hide things.So if he said that he has someone he likes, then he meant it. Fu Jinxiao wouldn\u2019t lie like that, let alone engage in those vain things for the popularity of a show. But it was because of this, it sparked another round of debate in the comment section:[I don\u2019t care, this must be a joke.][Who could it be? The paparazzi have never caught any news.][He will definitely protect his girlfriend very well.][No, this should be a lie to make the little girl give up.][Yes, yes, it must be so!]No matter what, the majority of netizens were best at deceiving themselves \u2013 they often forget that idols are also people, and some of them do want to get married. And yet, the fans were deep in denial, thinking it was just a fake scandal to gain hype.But this didn\u2019t matter to Fu Jinxiao. He smoothly started teaching the class.But other people\u2019s work was obviously not going so smoothly, especially Tuya, whose \u201cgardening\u201d work was\u2026 cutting firewood for the kitchen. While Shen Xingchen was in charge of cooking. His level was at \u201cnot able to tell the difference between shallots and garlic\u201d.Anran and Shen Xingsui were both janitors. When the two of them were picking up cleaning tools in the kitchen, they saw the chaos in the kitchen. It was really an eye-opener. It single-handedly made them glad for their lottery draw.Tuya was trying to light a fire, but the fire in the stove refused to be lit no matter what.Anran has always been a little angel with a considerate personality in public. He said to Tuya, \u201cInstructor Tuya, don\u2019t worry, just take your time. It\u2019s your first time operating this kind of stove, so it\u2019s normal to not be able to do it perfectly.\u201dTuya forced a smile in her frustration. \u201cThank you, Ranran.\u201dIn fact, because Tuya was from Germany \u2013 although her Chinese is already fluent now \u2013 she never used this kind of Chinese earthen stove!In fact, there was also a gas stove in the kitchen, but the staff didn\u2019t let them use it for the sake of views. They knew the earthen stove was much harder, and thus, would produce better content for the filming.The audience in the live broadcast room were also very emotional at this scene:[Ranran is really caring.][Anran is a good person, comforting Instructor Tuya.]After a while, Shen Xingsui also came over. When he stepped in, he choked because of the thick smoke there. Tuya was also ashamed, not only did she fail at her task, her delicate makeup was also ruined by the smoke and soot.Seeing this, Shen Xingsui hurriedly went near the teacher, \u201cInstructor Tuya, are you okay?\u201dShe dusted off her hands, then pointed at the stove, \u201cI want to blow the fire once the ember starts but\u2026 it\u2019s just all smoke\u2026\u201dShen Xingsui found that Tuya used paper as the initial ignition to support the combustion. And from his experience, such material wasn\u2019t very effective in lighting up a wood.\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Shen Xingsui smiled. He knew this, so he knelt down and said, \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll light the fire for you, and it will be much more convenient for you.\u201dDuring the show, Tuya had a good impression of Shen Xingsui. It was because he was a rare clean and sincere person in this muddy entertainment circle. He made her happy, but also worried. This worry also spilled over today. \u201cWill this count as a foul on your part?\u201dShen Xingsui looked at the cameramen behind him.One of the cameramen said, \u201cAs long as you finish your own cleaning work, there\u2019s no foul if you help other guests.\u201dShen Xingsui smiled and said to Tuya, \u201cLook, it\u2019s all right.\u201dHelping her make a fire next to her was not an easy job. He first put those small branches together, and then took the flammable pile of dead leaves and lit them. After it burned, he stuffed them into the stove and waited for the ember to begin. After the fire burns brightly, the heat was so great that their foreheads began covered with sweat, soon, and dust. It was not a very flattering look.But Shen Xingsui still adjusted the fire with tongs, put all the wood in and lit it until it could burn normally. Then, he wiped his ashy face as he said to Tuya, \u201cAll right. It\u2019s done.\u201dTuya\u2019s eyes lit up and praised him, \u201cSuisui, you are amazing, how can you do this?\u201dShen Xingsui smiled shyly, \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult, because I had practice. During my stay in the Zhang family\u2019s house, they have this kind of stove too, and I had used it before.\u201dTuya saw that he just rubbed the ashes on his face because he wiped his face, and the two gray marks appeared on his fair cheeks, which looked a little hot and uncomfortable. She moved to give him a hug with enthusiasm, \u201cAhhh, I love you so much.\u201dShen Xingsui took a step back and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m covered in sweat\u2026\u201dTuya didn\u2019t care. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast room were also happy when they saw this ridiculous scene:[These two people are too cute.][Doing it and empty talk sure are a mile difference.][Anran just\u2026 comfort Tuya for a long time and didn\u2019t even offer his help?][Didn\u2019t he stay in the Zhang family for more than ten years before, how could he not know how to use that stove?][Suisui is really good. His words might be clumsy, but he is always sincere.][I feel like I understand him very much.][I am also a person with a stupid mouth. Seeing Suisui like this makes me very emotional.][Yup, that is the epitome of \u201cShen Xingsui\u201d I think. Optimistic and hardworking, I really stan the right person!]Shen Xingchen from behind came over and hurriedly pulled away and said, \u201cInstructor, you have to stay away from my brother! He is still young, he is not suitable, not suitable! \u201c\u201cHow old do you think I am, huh?\u201d Tuya was able to take a joke, and deliberately reached out and pulled Shen Xingsui\u2019s clothes, saying: \u201cI\u2019m in my twenties, and I\u2019ve reached the age to talk about marriage~\u201dShen Xingsui didn\u2019t know what to say.Tuya also teased him as if she was addicted, \u201cDoes Suisui have someone he likes?\u201dShen Xing Sui choked up when asked this question, blushing for the most part. The shyness and embarrassment of this cute little appearance made Tuya laugh loudly. \u201cWe all have that special someone in our hearts. Let this jiejie tell you, whoever you like in this entertainment industry, she can help you connect with them~\u201dShen Xingsui balked from embarrassment: \u201cTuya-jie!\u201dThe staff at the back reminded them that it was time to continue their job. Only then this three-person conversation ended in high notes. There were obviously four people in the kitchen, but Anran was completely ignored.In fact, not long ago, because of his unenthusiastic and shy personality, Shen Xingsui was an invisible presence in the entire program group. But gradually, as time passed, he became more and more open-minded for no reason. Like a dusty gem slowly revealing its luster, once it was polished, it\u2019s something everyone coveted.This was a really bad situation for Anran.Anran took a deep breath, looked at Shen Xingsui who was cleaning the tree-lined path not far away, and decided to take the initiative to find Fu Jinxiao on the third floor.The audience in the live broadcast room wondered about this move:[Both of them are the janitors, right? Why is Anran going without sweeping the floor?][He seems to be going to the teaching building.][Hey, can you not slack off?]However, despite the audience\u2019s ire, Anran has already arrived at the teaching building upstairs. There, he wiped the floor in the corridor, and lurked around up until the students were out of class. He then arranged an \u201caccidental\u201d bumping into Fu Jinxiao who just finished his duty as a teacher.Anran smiled and leaned closer. \u201cFu-ge!\u201dFu Jinxiao was a little surprised hearing this voice. He raised his eyebrow as he asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2018What\u2019s with that question? Otherwise, who do you want to be here instead?\u2019Anran complained in his heart, but he didn\u2019t show it on his face. He still showed a sweet smile and said, \u201cIt\u2019s me. I was cleaning around here just now, and then I ran into you.\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded casually and asked, \u201cSince you\u2019re cleaning\u2026 where\u2019s Shen Xingsui? He should be a fellow janitor, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShen Xingsui, Shen Xingsui, SHEN XINGSUI!Why is it him again?\u2018I stand in front of you and you still asked for Shen Xingsui! Argh. That bitch is so annoying!\u2019Anran was silent for a while before opening his mouth: \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know. I saw him before, I think he\u2019s cleaning outside the building. But it\u2019s been a while now, maybe he\u2019s gone somewhere?\u201dHe replied: \u201cGot it.\u201dSeeing that Actor Fu was about to leave, Anran panicked. He quickly chased after him with a little shout, \u201cFu-ge, wait!\u201dFu Jinxiao stopped in his tracks and looked back at him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cWell, actually I want to ask you, have you found any hint cards during this time?\u201d Anran found a reason for himself to talk, and continued this topic with a smile, \u201cI think we can exchange hints. I actually want to find the assassin as soon as possible, because I think they\u2019re going on a killing spree soon. We will all be in danger then.\u201dFu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows, \u201cWhy should I believe you?\u201dAnran immediately negotiated,\u00a0 \u201cI can tell you my hint first. Then, after you listen, you can decide to tell me your hint or not.\u201dFu Jinxiao: \u201cDeal.\u201dSeeing that he agreed, Anran smiled, and said, \u201cI have a mission card, and the hint on it are: [Tonight3FJX\u2019s name, Jinxiao is \u4eca\u5bb5, which means \u201ctonight\u201d is a good night]\u201dThis hint card was very straightforward and immediately cornered him in particular. People who didn\u2019t know the truth will definitely focus on Fu Jinxiao. Plus, people in this kind of mystery game are generally very suspicious \u2013 and Anran was sure this was enough to fluster Fu Jinxiao too.But Fu Jinxiao only raised his eyebrows and smiled mysteriously, \u201cDo you doubt me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t dare.\u201d Anran stood obediently, \u201cIt\u2019s just because the hint on the card is like this, so I want to share it with Fu-ge and see if you have any clues.\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded lightly. \u201cI have\u2026 another card, and the clue is: [The events of that year were recorded by the old servant. It is stored at the study, in the manor\u2019s old attic.]\u201dAnran\u2019s eyes widened.Fu Jinxiao spoke slowly, \u201cShen Xingsui and I went to look for it, but we didn\u2019t find that record. Shen Xingchen and the others went there too, but they didn\u2019t find it. So this clue is the most difficult to decipher.\u201dAnran seemed to be relieved. \u201cReally?\u201dFu Jinxiao nodded: \u201cYes, but I think that should be the key clue.\u201d\u201cI remember that the door to the attic is locked.\u201d Anran asked, \u201cHow did you go inside?\u201dFu Jinxiao replied: \u201cI asked for the key from the staff, but there is only one key. Because I haven\u2019t found the record yet, I hid the key under the carpet next to the attic.\u201dAnran nodded thoughtfully.Fu Jinxiao raised his eyelids to look at him, the man\u2019s eyes were deep black, swirling with unfathomable thoughts. However, his aura was his usual \u2013 all polite and kind. \u201cThe clue you gave me is very important, Can you show me your card?\u201dAnran froze. He subconsciously answered, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe hint card you mentioned.\u201d Fu Jinxiao leaned against the railing of the stairs, and the tall and handsome man looked down at him. \u201cOtherwise, how would I know if it\u2019s true or not?\u201d1love affair.2hyping up a (fake) couple.3FJX\u2019s name, Jinxiao is \u4eca\u5bb5, which means \u201ctonight\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Young man, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re still too tender.][Damn it, when you thought you were on the third floor, he was already on the fifth floor.][Sister, no, he\u2019s actually already in the atmosphere!]Anran stiffly explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t bring the hint card with me, because I was afraid of being snatched by the assassin. I\u2026 uh, put it in another place. But Fu-ge, no need to worry, I really didn\u2019t lie to you. How about I\u2019ll send the card to your room for you to see when I go back at night?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Fu Jinxiao lazily refused, stood up and looked downstairs. When he saw Shen Xingsui at the bottom floor with the corner of his eyes, he smiled. Then, he explained his reason to Anran, \u201cIt\u2019s not good if people see us and misunderstand it.\u201dAnran: \u201c\u2026?\u201dIt\u2019s Anran who took the initiative to go into Fu Jinxiao\u2019s room. While Anran wasn\u2019t afraid, it\u2019s Fu Jinxiao who didn\u2019t want others to \u201cmisunderstand\u201d.This implication wasn\u2019t harmful, but it was extremely insulting.This, however, was very funny for the audience.[Fu-ge is a clean man indeed. Hahahaha!][Gossip? Impossible. Nip them in the bud!][You don\u2019t have to worry about a man who will strangle any scandal at the cradle.]By noon, most of the guests had already finished their work for half a day. The tasks issued for this morning was really a lot of trouble for everyone, but it was especially troublesome for Shen Xingchen. Thankfully, there\u2019s another lottery draw by noon, and he was freed from his kitchen duty. Li Xu\u2019an, who went from being the security guard to a canteen worker, got his job. He somehow managed to whip up a proper lunch.The students all eat at the canteen for lunch. So the number of orders was overwhelming.Shen Xingsui also came to help. He was in charge of serving the food, but when a little boy was waiting in line, the boy refused when he was offered. With a hoarse voice, the little boy said, \u201cTeacher, please just give me the rice.\u201dShen Xingsui was taken aback. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI brought my own food.\u201d He said, \u201cI just need the rice.\u201dAlthough Shen Xingsui was puzzled, he still complied with the child\u2019s request. But the curiosity was killing him, so after the boy left, he asked a child behind him: \u201cIs he in your class?\u201dThe child nodded in affirmation.Shen Xingsui asked, \u201cThen he really brought his own vegetables?\u201dThe child replied,\u00a0 \u201cHe has always eaten the pickles he brought from home. It has been like this for several weeks.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Shen Xingsui frowned inwardly. He didn\u2019t want the child to think he was frowning at the child. \u201cIs the food here expensive? It shouldn\u2019t be\u2026 right? It\u2019s a few yuan for a set meal, which consists of several dishes.\u201dThe child shook his head and said, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t want to pay for the food, because he said he wanted to save money to buy a harmonica.\u201dShen Xingsui was puzzled, \u201cWhy does he want that?\u201d\u201cHe likes music!\u201d The child behind said with a smile, \u201cHe wants to be a musician, but his singing skill is terrible. So he said he wants to learn to play a musical instrument!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShen Xingsui fell silent.Perhaps because he felt his heart hurt a little for the boy, Shen Xingsui left the cafeteria and went outside, where the majority of the children liked to eat. It\u2019s easy for him to spot the boy eating \u2013 he sat near the flower bed not far away.\u201cAh, so you\u2019re here.\u201d Shen Xingsui walked over with light steps. He saw the lunch box next to the child, and there were indeed some dried radishes and peppers inside. However, those weren\u2019t sufficient to support a young boy\u2019s growth, so he frowned and asked, \u201cWhy do you just eat this?\u201dThe boy turned his head to see who\u2019s talking to him. Seeing it was Shen Xingsui, he immediately became nervous.\u201cI brought you some meat bread1not really meat bread, it\u2019s actually \u70e4\u997c/kaobing, but this is the closest thing I can translate it into..\u201d Shen Xingsui took them out from behind and gave them to the boy, \u201cThis is baked by Instructor Tuya. It\u2019s delicious, please try it.\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes gleamed when he saw the sweet pastry, but his body language indicated that he was hesitating for some reason.Shen Xingsui smiled lightly, trying to reassure the boy, \u201cNo need for money.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, the boy let go of his hesitation completely. This bread was stuffed full of aromatic meat. It was very delicious, and the boy gobbled it up within seconds.Shen Xingsui quickly patted him on the back: \u201cDon\u2019t eat too fast, you\u2019ll choke. Don\u2019t worry, I can get another for you after your lunch.\u201dThe little boy shook his head, and said in a low voice, \u201cNo need for another, Teacher. Thank you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Shen Xingsui took advantage of the situation to ask, \u201cI heard that you want to buy a harmonica. Do you like music?\u201dThe little boy hesitated and nodded.Shen Xingsui smiled and said, \u201cWhat song do you like?\u201dThe little boy swallowed the bread in his mouth and replied softly, \u201cShimmer.\u201d\u201c?\u201d Shen Xingsui was taken aback, \u201cWhich \u2018Shimmer\u2019\u2026?\u201d\u201cThis one\u2026\u201d Then, the boy sang a few very recognizable lines.Shen Xingsui had no words. This was the first time he heard someone cover his own song in reality, and the most amazing thing was that this person sang it out of tune in front of him.Shen Xingsui pursed his lips and smiled, hesitantly said: \u201cDo you know who sang this song?\u201d\u201cI think the singer was a group of big brothers?\u201d The little boy lowered his head, \u201cActually, I can\u2019t remember, but Grandma really likes to listen to this song. But she is old and sick, and often cannot sleep because of the pain. If I sing this song to Grandma, she will laugh every time.\u201dShen Xingsui felt really touched by this. He sank down a little, then asked in a soft tone, \u201cIs your grandma seriously ill?\u201dThe little boy replied, \u201cShe said it was an old illness.\u201dShen Xingsui asked, \u201cWhere are your parents, will they take care of Grandma?\u201d\u201cBoth of them work somewhere out of the town. So it\u2019s just me and Grandma at home.\u201d\u00a0 The little boy was tanned unevenly across his body, so it\u2019s clear he actually had a fair share of working outside too. \u201cMy parents will send a little money back every month, and sometimes they forget, so I go to the farm with my grandma and sell some vegetables.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s because no one usually chatted with him \u2013 once someone had taken the initiative to talk and listen to him, the floodgate opened, and this boy really could talk his mouth off.He said that his grandma likes to listen to people singing on TV.He said that because the Internet at home is not good, he actually sang more songs to grandma in compensation.He likes to sing very much, and he thinks it would be great if he can become a singer in the future.He said that he also wrote songs, but his classmates said he wouldn\u2019t make it as a musician because his composition isn\u2019t good.Shen Xingsui asked, \u201cCan I see the song you composed?\u201dThe little boy hesitated for a moment, but relented and took out a neatly folded, but a little wrinkled piece of paper from his pocket. There were some notes written on it with a clumsy hand, and the lines were uneven. It\u2019s clear he still hasn\u2019t understood writing songs yet. As for the lyrics, the little boy clearly tried to make it as poetic and rhyme, but it was clearly the work of a child.However, despite all of this, Shen Xingsui was impressed. He could see some potential with this clumsy work.Music was something extracted from the heart, after all. And this work clearly was that.Shen Xingsui said, \u201cDid you write this yourself?\u201dThe little boy nodded.Looking at Shen Xingsui\u2019s expression, he became a little more unconfident. He kinda wanted to take it back so this big brother won\u2019t see it anymore. \u201cGrandma always said that if I like to sing, I should sing. If I become a singer in the future, she will definitely listen to me singing every day. B-but\u2026 she\u2019s not healthy. I\u2019m afraid that she won\u2019t be able to hear it in the future, so I tried to write a song now. But it didn\u2019t seem to be very successful\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could it be?\u201d Shen Xingsui said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously well written.\u201dThe little boy hesitated, \u201cBut my classmates all said that my lyrics are poor, and even if I arrange them, they will be ugly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense.\u201d Shen Xingsui patted the little boy\u2019s head, \u201cMusic has no limits, your lyrics are very good. The arrangement is not bad either. I know this is a nice song.\u201dThe little boy\u2019s dark face subconsciously showed a simple smile, and his dark eyes seemed to have a bright light inside, \u201cReally?\u201dShen Xingsui showed him a genuine smile, \u201cTrust me.\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast room also laughed in fondness.[Little friend, the strongest arranger of \u201cStarlight\u201d is in front of you.][Hahaha, you can always trust Shen Xingsui with composition.][If Suisui says that it is good, then it\u2019s 100% must be good!][Pure passerby here, is his composing ability really that good?][It\u2019s no exaggeration! Besides, if he\u2019s a hack, then why did almost all of the \u201cStarlight\u201d contestants come to him for his opinion on their musical arrangement? That, and he also arranged all of the songs he sang there.]The lunch time finally ended. Most of the guests were finally given the precious time to rest.One of them found out that Shen Xingsui was missing and came out to find him. After searching him for a minute or two, they happened to see Shen Xingsui at the playground not far away. He was reading something, and a little boy was sitting beside.The afternoon sun was particularly gentle today. It meanders through the foliage, then it illuminates the two people there. It made a particularly serene scene.Tuya, one of the people who saw this, started gnawing on the pastry she baked herself. With an emotional tone, she said, \u201cAh\u2026 Suisui\u2019s temperament is actually very handsome like this, don\u2019t you think? He looks so gentle\u2026 I bet that when he starts his career in the future, he will be crazily popular with many kinds of people.\u201dShen Xingchen nodded in fierce agreement. \u201cOf course he will!\u201dFu Jinxiao, who was next to him, leaned against the door. He looked away from the playground, and it drew an unknown gentle smile on his smile.Then, he turned to Tuya. The air suddenly dropped a few degrees as he said, \u201cI heard you want to\u2026 matchmake him up with someone in this circle?\u201dTuya was peacefully eating her pastries when shivers went down her spine. She felt an inexplicable sense of threat, like the creepy feeling of being preyed upon by a venomous snake. It almost choked her. Running on pure survival instinct, she replied, \u201cAhem, ahem\u2026 where did you hear that nonsense?\u201d\u201cNowhere. It\u2019s nothing, really. I just think that since you are so warm-hearted\u2026. then\u2026\u201d Fu Jinxiao trailed. He seemed to have made some kind of choice. The tall man changed his posture, facing the terrified Tuya, while his face was still serene. If anything, his gentle smile only turned gentler, somehow. He dragged his vowels, deepened his tones, then bent to whisper near Tuya\u2019s ears. With a very quiet voice, he asked Tuya:\u201cWell, would you like to help me too?\u201dTuya: \u201c \u2026?\u201d1not really meat bread, it\u2019s actually \u70e4\u997c/kaobing, but this is the closest thing I can translate it into.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, in her opinion, there was a big reason why Fu Jinxiao, who has kept himself clean and single all year round, has never had a date. And the reason was because he was picky!He didn\u2019t like the good-looking ones, the ugly ones, the smart ones, the stupid ones, the profit-seeking ones, and the ascetic ones. To be honest, he was ridiculously clean to the point her group of friends was secretly betting on whether Fu Jinxiao would stay single for the rest of his life!But\u2026Wouldn\u2019t being looked at by this old fox be\u2026 a pitiful fate? Wouldn\u2019t they be eaten to death?With much difficulty, Tuya struggled but managed to ask him, \u201cWhich person do you want me to help you connect with?\u201dFu Jinxiao stood opposite her, raising his eyebrows when he heard this, as if Tuya was talking nonsense to him. But he still answered her with a slow drawl, \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d\u2018Yaya doesn\u2019t know, it\u2019s none of Yaya\u2019s business.\u2019Others don\u2019t know about this event, but Tuya could be said to be terrified. Tonight was bound to be a sleepless and restless night. But! She wanted to share this gossip! But, but! There\u2019s nobody to share this with (without risking her life). She was so uncomfortable.Afternoon passed, the director\u2019s team gathered everyone together. The sun was not very hot, the staff stood in front and said: \u201cNow that everyone\u2019s work for the morning and noon shift has been finished, let me announce the ranking of the players with the highest professionalism and after comprehensive consideration.\u201dFu Jinxiao scored 230 points,Instructor Li and Tuya scored 200 points,Shen Xingsui scored 180 points,Li Xu\u2019an scored 178 points,Shen Xingchen scored 150 points,Anran scored 142 points\u2026After the rankings were released in order, Shen Xingchen was quite dissatisfied: \u201cDirector, I have worked hard all morning to cook, and only give me have 150 points, is that appropriate?\u201d\u201cHey, it\u2019s generous of us to give you this score,\u201d The director said with a deadpan expression:,\u201dThe ingredients you wasted and the pots and pans you smashed are more than enough to deduct your points.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShen Xingchen fell into a rare silence.Of course, the audience had some sass to say:[Young Master isn\u2019t cooking the ingredients, he\u2019s cooking the kitchen.][Hehehe, I\u2019m still willing to eat any food he cooks~][Are you sure? You\u2019re not afraid of dying from that food?][Yeah, it\u2019s worrying, hahaha.]The director ordered again, \u201cNow, you all go back to your original position from this morning. The top three winners of this afternoon\u2019s competition will get a small gift bag and a hint card, please work hard!\u201dThis brief meeting was equivalent to checking scores. And because of their work before, they already had an idea of what to do.Shen Xingchen went back to the kitchen in the afternoon and wanted to chop some firewood, but happened to meet Anran who came to fetch water. Anran came over with a smile and said, \u201cIs Chen-ge chopping firewood?\u201dShen Xingchen replied in reflex, \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cChen-ge, can I try?\u201d Anran asked from the side.Shen Xingchen said impatiently, \u201cWhat are you doing? You can\u2019t even hold an axe steady with that little strength. Have you finished your work? Don\u2019t come here to make trouble for me.\u201dAnran choked up, but still used his usual coquettish trick. He said with a softer approach, \u201cI just want to try it. If you let me try it, I\u2019ll leave. I promise I won\u2019t bother you. Really, I\u2019ve never split wood before. This looks so fun.\u201dShen Xingchen was disgusted by Anran\u2019s demeanor. He wanted Anran to go away as soon as possible, so he just relented, \u201cOkay, fine. Try it.\u201dAnran took the axe happily and tried it a few times. He couldn\u2019t split the log with a couple of blows, so he gave up and returned the axe to Shen Xingchen. He sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s so heavy, Chen-ge, be careful when you\u2019re using this. Or else, your back will definitely hurt in two days.\u201dShen Xingchen didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to him. \u201cI\u2019m in good health, you take care of yourself first.\u201dAnran could see that he was getting impatient, and finally wisely left after returning the axe to him.In the afternoon, everyone was busy with work, trying to earn points in their respective positions. They gradually became familiar with the students, and occasionally stopped to chat for a while. The students in this school were very shy and withdrawn. When chatting, they usually grouped up together. They were currently happily playing around.When Shen Xingsui was cleaning in the afternoon, he talked less. He always worked silently by himself. He would not go to play with other people when he could rest occasionally, but just sat in a daze in one place.Netizens had a mixed opinions about this:[What are you doing? You\u2019re too tired so you\u2019re just sneaking around?][So boring.][Could it be, he\u2019s writing a song? Don\u2019t just look at the surface when judging people.][The fans are too outrageous. So you say he\u2019s writing a song without any pen and paper?]Although the audience was complaining, they didn\u2019t always mean it. In fact, the more vicious the complaints were, it would attract more of the fans to defend Shen Xingsui. On the contrary, the number of people was still rising. The live broadcast platform has given each guest a separate live broadcast room, and each live broadcast room has a number of currently watching audiences. As of present, Shen Xingsui\u2019s popularity is second only to Fu Jinxiao and Shen Xingchen, and even surpasses most members of the boy group.In the evening, after their task\u2013The director announced today\u2019s points ranking. Not surprisingly, the top three winners are: Fu Jinxiao, Shen Xingchen, and Tuya.Instructor Li raised his hand and asked, \u201cWhy is Shen Xingchen second? Didn\u2019t he break a lot of bowls?\u201d\u201cYes, but it was covered by the number of logs he cut today for the fuel. Even the canteen auntie praised him for that.\u201dInstructor Li: \u201c\u2026\u201dNo one expected it to be like this.The director saw that everyone was exhausted and had a hard day, so he said: \u201cIf everyone has no objections, we can clean up later, say goodbye to the students, and then we can leave the school.\u201dShen Xingsui raised his hand: \u201cDirector, I have something to say.\u201dThe program team looked at him unexpectedly.\u201cI passed a classroom when I was cleaning today.\u201d Shen Xingsui said with a smile, \u201cI saw an old piano inside, so I want to ask if it can be used?\u201dThe director didn\u2019t know what he was using it for, but still replied, \u201cYes, yes, but what do you want to use it for?\u201dShen Xingsui had a gentle smile on his face, \u201cI want to play a song as a gift for a student here.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, the audience in the live broadcast room naturally knew who this student he was referring to. When the director was hesitant on his decision, Shen Xingsui used his trump card, \u201cI remember that during the call session in the morning , you promised me to get one instance of help or request from the staff anytime.\u201dThe director could only nod, \u201cThen you want to\u2026\u201dShen Xingsui replied, \u201cYes, I will use up this opportunity. \u201cThis was a crucial opportunity to make a request with the staff team. No one thought that Shen Xingsui would use it without hesitation, just to play the piano once!But since he said so, of course the program group wouldn\u2019t break their promise. After organizing the guests to eat in the cafeteria, the piano had already been tuned and carried out.It was almost night, around 6 o\u2019clock. The sky was dyed red with the twilight, and the piano was neatly arranged on the playground. Besides the guests and the staff, the students and the school\u2019s staff were also here.To Shen Xingsui\u2019s surprise, that little boy Qi Xiao was also among them.The director said to Shen Xingsui, \u201cThis piano is ready to use now. We had already asked a piano tuner to make sure it can be played.\u201dIt\u2019s all handled very well. Shen Xingsui responded with a thank you.He walked in front of the piano, and the children passing by all around stopped. Shen Xingsui walked in front of the piano, his hand dropped, and his fingertips slid across the piano. His movements were elegant and natural, and he was probably familiarizing himself with this particular piano.After playing a couple of tunes, he raised his head to look at the crowd, and smiled slightly, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet everyone in this school. Before I leave, I want to sing a song for a particular student here.\u201dThe wind blows in the sunset, bringing a little coolness. The young man sitting in the center of the playground has a straight figure, illuminated with the soft dusk\u2019s glow. He was eye-catching.Shen Xingsui pressed the piano keys with his slender and fair fingers, and the crisp and elegant piano sound poured out. This was a somewhat low tone, very gentle, although very simple. But with an inexplicable tenderness, his hands fell on the piano keys, and the melody was clear.After a short intro section, the young man started singing, his voice was very gentle in the twilight sunset:\u201cIf I were the wind, then I\u2019m the invincible wind.\u201d\u201cRolling under the sun, crossing fields, through the mountains, and finally arriving at your side.\u201dThe lyrics were simple, it was very poetic, and it didn\u2019t have any rhyme. But with a low and elegant tune, the beauty was still clear to everyone hearing it. The touch of childishness didn\u2019t feel out of place; if anything, it gave a hint of innocence and nostalgia. It reminded the adults of their childhood\u2019s days.As the sun died down, the sky gradually turned dark purple. It casted Shen Xingsui in a long shadow, his singing voice was so contagious that the originally noisy playground became inexplicably quiet, everyone was listening to the song.The audience in the live broadcast room were shocked:[Don\u2019t tell me this is the song of that kid he met during lunch?][He actually composed the song in one afternoon, and even memorized the song!][Wait, didn\u2019t we watch him all afternoon? When did he have time to compose it then?][He actually write it in that short of a time?? Insane\u2026]\u201cIf I were a beam of light, then I\u2019m just a thin strip of light, peeking through the trees and the foliages.\u201d\u201cIn the dark night, I will creep over the high wall, break through the darkness, as the moonlight that fell down on you.\u201dThe melody lowered down, then it swelled up during the refrain. Shen Xingsui\u2019s voice was clean and pure. He raised his face, his gaze crossed the crowd and landed on the boy with red eyes. He could see the young boy mouthed along the lyrics, trying his best to not let his tears fall.\u201cSo the weather won\u2019t be hot all the time, so the night won\u2019t be dark all the time. The temperature will drop, the sun will rise, and our days will definitely be fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay if it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s okay if the sun doesn\u2019t rise. Our days will definitely be fine in the end\u2026\u201dAs the melody rose up, Shen Xingsui kept his voice steady and clear. The clean piano ring sounded graceful and lovely, dancing side-by-side with Shen Xingsui\u2019s singing. Shen Xingsui did not break his voice, and his rich and deep appeal was explosive. The lyrics might be immature and nonsensical, but when it was sung from the depths of his heart, it was enough to draw people in. The joyful emotion perfectly harmonized with the inner affection.\u201cAnd so\u2026\u201d Shen Xingsui slid his keys across the piano keys, and his voice sank: \u201cWe will wait until the sun rises again.\u201dWhen the last steel note fell, the audience was silent.Then, someone took the lead to give him a warm applause. Little by little, everyone followed. This was especially exciting for the students \u2013 this was the first time they saw a professional musician playing live.Shen Xingsui stood up and bowed to everyone, his movements were elegant and solemn.He was not wearing a tuxedo, but when he stood next to the piano, he had that regal bearing of a musician during his recital. He was confident, he was the master of his own music, he was the protagonist. Everyone\u2019s attention was on him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

See you tomorrow~Shen Xingsui smiled at the students who were the most enthusiastic party. Then, he said softly, \u201cDo you think it sounds good?\u201dThe children replied in unison: \u201cIt sounds good!\u201d\u201cActually, this is not a song I wrote.\u201d Shen Xingsui\u2019s words stunned many children. But he waved at Qi Xiao and explained it to everyone, \u201cThis is Qi Xiao, he is your classmate, and he is the original composer of this song.\u201dThe students were in an uproar.Qi Xiao was scrawny due to his poor nutrition. The top of his head only reached Shen Xingsui\u2019s chest. As he was called, he stood there stupidly, looking at Shen Xingsui in a daze. Finally, he walked to the center of the playground surrounded by his classmates. Standing beside the piano, he looked like helpless.Shen Xingsui bent down and looked at him at the same level, showing a slight smile: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I made an arrangement of your composition without your consent.\u201dQi Xiao shook his head quickly.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Shen Xingsui asked him warmly, \u201cIs this what you imagined this song to be like?\u201dQi Xiao nodded without any hesitation. He was very nervous, but he still whispered out in a shaky voice, \u201cYes, yes, it is. But\u2026 it sounded far better than I could\u2019ve imagine.\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026everyone said that my lyrics were bad, not good at all.\u201d Qi Xiao\u2019s hand subconsciously shook. He played with the hem of his clothes, trying to calm his racing heart. \u201cA-and\u2026 if I sing it myself, it won\u2019t sound good.\u201dNo one interrupted him, even though he was stumbling over his words. He was also very nervous, making his voice hard to be heard clearly.Shen Xingsui watched the boy from the beginning to the end. After listening to him patiently, he stretched out his hand and wiped the thin sweat on the boy\u2019s forehead. With a smile on his face, he softly comforted, \u201cHow could it be? I think your composition and lyrics are very nice.\u201dQi Xiao was on the brink of tears. \u201cReally?\u201dShen Xingsui nodded, the sunset glow fell on him\u00a0 casting a layer of golden halo around him. When the light hit just right, it made his dark eyes seemed sparkling. \u201cReally, didn\u2019t I prove to you, Qi Xiao? You are not bad at all, you are my pride.\u201dThese words seemed to hit something inside of Qi Xiao\u2019s heart.The boy\u2019s lips, which was pressed taut all this time, started to tremble. He gasped twice, but couldn\u2019t hold back his sobs. Eventually, tears uncontrollably tolled down. He tried to cover up his face with his arm, wetting his it in the process. Despite his own efforts of stopping his cry, he kept choking on his sobs. It\u2019s as if all of his bottled-up emotions blew up in one go \u2013 all he could do was just let it flow naturally.He was finally recognized of his passion and effort.His dream was validated by someone who clearly a musician.Shen Xingsui gave the young boy a hug, and the boy never refused. If anything, he threw himself to Shen Xingsui\u2019s arm, and burrowed deeper in seek of emotional comfort.This emotion even infected the live broadcast room. The barrages were flooded by people who was moved.[I\u2019m in tears\u2026.][Suisui, you are our pride!][Wuwu, this is my idol. He\u2019s very good at composing, he\u2019s very good in singing, and he\u2019s an angel QAQ][I\u2019m sure this can change this young boy\u2019s life too\u2026][He himself was eliminated in the draft and almost couldn\u2019t continue to sing. He has worked very hard, too! I think\u2026 he symphatizes with this boy. He wants to let him shine.][Ah, don\u2019t remind me of that. It always make me cry\u2026]Originally, everyone\u2019s understanding of Shen Xingsui was only superficial. But today, his ability to arrange music, his emphasis on a child\u2019s dream, and his kindness have moved the majority of people. It was also the first time that the hot topic about Shen Xingsui skyrocketed to the first place.#ShenXingsuiHelpingABoy##He\u2019sMyFavoriteIdol#The live scene was also very lively. After Qi Xiao\u2019s cries subsided, the students were in absolute shock to learn that Shen Xingsui was the original composer of \u201cShimmer\u201d. His state hasn\u2019t ended even after he was picked up by his grandma.However, he recovered from his dazed state when the guests were going to perform \u201cShimmer\u201d right here, right now.The line-up was really luxurious. If this wasn\u2019t spontaneous, they probably would need to shell out a huge sum to invite all these celebrities.In this version, the piano accompaniment was played by Fu Jinxiao, and Tuya and Instructor Li also joined in the dancing parts. Of course, the boy group members plus Shen Xingsui was the main force of this performance. This probably could be counted as fulfilling Qi Xiao\u2019s grandma dream.When the sunset finally flooded the horizon and the night officially came, the exciting school day was over. The red blanket in the sky was switched over by the sparkling stars, guarding everyone\u2019s way back. They might be exhausted, but they were chatting happily.The camera recorded this flourishing scene.[Ah, now I understand why this reality show is named \u201cBright Stars\u201d.][I used to complain in adding Shen Xingsui in the line-up. Now I\u2019m getting slapped in the face.][I\u2019m going to listen to his previous works!!][I look forward to more of his good works! I will be your new fan in the future~]After everyone returned to the villa, they still couldn\u2019t rest. The director gathered everyone together. Today was the fourth day of this program, which means there\u2019s only one day and one night left. The ending was nigh.The director said, \u201cI see that everyone seems to be having a good time, but I have to announce one thing. Today, three of you were poisoned by the assassin in public, and you only have half your life left. As long as the killer succeeds again, the three of you will be eliminated and punished.\u201dEveryone was dumbfounded.The director directly read out the list: \u201cShen Xingchen, Li Xu\u2019an, Anran.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone fell silent.Shen Xingchen was the first to jump up, \u201cHow is it possible, how could I be poisoned, why didn\u2019t I know when I was poisoned?\u201dThere was no unnecessary expression on the director\u2019s face, he just said truthfully, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you Shen Xingchen, you have indeed been poisoned by the assassin once. You are only half-alive now. If the assassin successfully attack you again, then your dead.\u201d\u201cI also want to tell everyone. Those who are not poisoned should not think about being alone. If the assassin succeeds in poisoning the prince, then as long as the prince is half poisoned, everyone will be half poisoned. If the prince fails to die and is eliminated, then all of his royal guard will follow suit.\u201d The director clarified this point again, \u201cYour goal is to find and protect the prince, and at the same time find the assassin.\u201dShen Xingchen raised his hand, he hasn\u2019t give up yet, \u201cDirector, can I ask, does this assassin can poison us without limit? And if the condition is that good, can I join in that camp instead?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone was amused by this stupid speech.The director couldn\u2019t help laughing, but he still answered honestly, shaking his head in helplessness, \u201cNope. Poisoning someone successfully has its own set of rules to follow. At present, if you\u2019re poisoned, it just means that you simply aren\u2019t aware of this secret condition.\u201dThis helped clarify a lot of things.Simply put, if you are eliminated, then it\u2019s your own fault. If you don\u2019t follow the hint card, then you aren\u2019t thinking hard enough.By the time the directors finished talking to the guests and let everyone disperse, the guests who realized the seriousness of the matter finally had a little sense of crisis. Everyone gathered together and went to the small pavilion next to it to start a spontaneous meeting up.Tuya was the first to speak. \u201cLet me talk first. I think we need to exchange the hints and mission cards with each other, so we can deduce their identity faster and protect the prince better.\u201d\u201cI agree with this proposal.\u201d Instructor Li then followed it up by, \u201cThis is my card.\u201dAfter that, some of them follow his example.Instructor\u00a0 Li still has some prestige. He took the lead and said, \u201cMy two cards are very simple and strange. They told me a story. It said that there used to be a family in this manor, and their family was once the prefectural magistrate. One day, the higher-ups gave the head of this family a task; and the family made some secret preparations in order to fulfil the said task. However, after it was completed, the whole family was eradicated.\u201dTuya nodded in understanding. She then said, \u201cMy hint card also told me two story. One just straight up tell me that this \u201cyoung master\u201d character is the oldest son of his family. One of them is a card with a dragon drawn on it.\u201dShen Xingchen also took out his card and said: \u201cHm\u2026 we also managed to get a lot of hints. It said that he\u2019s very handsome, artistically gifted, popular, and well-loved.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an and Anran also showed their cards, \u201cWe have a story here. After the family was slayed, the only survivor was this young master. And his enemy is the prince. In order to get revenge, he has been secretly gathering allies everywhere. He also has a kind of power, with the secret signal of: tonight is a good night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen all the cards were displayed, everyone fell into silence.Not for anything else, the main reason wass that these clues were all over the place. They were either telling the plot of this setting, or casting a wide-net of the assassin\u2019s identity.Instructor Li glanced at Actor Fu and said, \u201cThis \u2018good night\u2019 line seems it\u2019s directly pointing at you, huh?\u201dFu Jinxiao leaned lazily on the sofa. Hearing this, he raised his eyebrows and smiled, \u201cSo, Instructor Li suspects me?With a look of lingering fear in his heart, he sighed, \u201cI am simply being cautious, please believe me.\u201dTuya giggled and laughed, \u201cAnd there is a clue that he is the eldest son. I remember you are the only child in the family.\u201dThe analysis sounded reasonable.However, the guests gazes at Fu Jinxiao wasn\u2019t wary \u2013 they were afraid instead!Facing everyone\u2019s doubts, Fu Jinxiao was very calm. He glanced at everyone and asked, \u201cThen I want to know, is the prince is amidst these three poisoned people?\u201dAll three young men shook their head.\u201cWell, to be expected. You three are poisoned but none of us are poisoned because of that. It seems that none of you are the prince. That assassin found the wrong person.\u201d Fu Jinxiao sat there frankly. Not only did he not panic, but he even seemed to be in a good mood, his arrogance was carved deep inside his marrow, \u201cWell, you see. If I\u2019m the assassin, it\u2019s game over now. I already win.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was silence in the room.This was a crazily bold arrogance. But this was Fu Jinxiao, it was expected of him to have this level of self-confidence.Why didn\u2019t the staff arranged for Fu Jinxiao to be the assassin? That\u2019s because he could really turn a five-day show into four. And win in the end.It was rare for Shen Xingchen to grasp the point, \u201cGe, you already know who the prince is?\u201dFu Jinxiao said with a smile, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s me?\u201dIf the prince\u2019s identity was revealed, he would become the main target. The assassins would definitely do everything possible to kill the prince first, so the game could be ended in the simplest way. That\u2019s why, if anyone claimed to be the prince now, it would only attract unnecessary aggro.Shen Xingchen sighed: \u201cThen if it\u2019s you, I won\u2019t worry. The assassin can\u2019t do anything to you.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an nodded in agreement, \u201cThen we won by lying down?\u201d\u201cWhat are you dreaming about?\u201d Tuya hit him with a smile, \u201cIf he is the prince, is it possible for the assassin to win? It will be just an auto-win if he\u2019s really the prince. Oh, if his \u2018darling\u2019 is the prince, then it\u2019s also an auto-win, I guess.\u201dShen Xingchen immediately integrated himself to Fu Jinxiao, and pretended to be coquettish in a sickeningly saccharine tone, \u201cFu-gege~ Do you see how your baby is poisoned now? Hurry up and protect me. Give me my revenge!\u201dWith a smile on his face, Fu Jinxiao replied with a voice that could freeze the hell over, \u201cIt seems that you\u2019re too impatient to wait for the poison to finish you off? You want to die at this moment right now?\u201dShen Xingchen trembled, and ran behind his brother to hide.Shen Xingsui didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, but taking advantage of everyone\u2019s jokes, he snuck a glanced at Fu Jinxiao meaningfully. Fu Jinxiao sensed this sneaky glanced, and met his eyes honestly. Shen Xingsui immediately looked somewhere else.Does Fu Jinxiao know that Shen Xingsui is the prince?Shen Xingsui was a little uncertain, but he subconsciously felt that Fu Jinxiao might know. After all, he believed in Fu Jinxiao\u2019s intelligence.If you can, please support me by donating on my ko-fi~ For every 2 ko-fis, I\u2019ll release an additional chapter ^^Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tomorrow, we have 2 chapters update! As for today, there will be 5 chapters total. But not all will be uploaded at the same time, I\u2019ll upload the later 3 chapters during the night.The next day was the final day.Everyone got up very early, then spontaneously gathered in the courtyard, looked at each other, and saw vigilance in each other\u2019s eyes.The director said: \u201cToday we have to complete a task. The assassin and his organization have arranged a mysterious formation in the town. Once activated at night, the entire town will be harmed by the spells. However, there\u2019s a way to solve this formation. According to legend, in a distant dynasty, the Peach Blossom Immortal left fragments of the holy beast in our town to protect the safety of the town. As long as everyone finds all the fragments and puts them together, the town can be protected and the assassin will be found out! Good luck!\u201dEveryone echoed and applauded.\u201cOf course, as long as you don\u2019t find everything before the night comes, or if you are all killed by the assassin in advance, the formation will still be activated.\u201d The director said: \u201cSo everyone must work hard!\u201dShen Xingchen has a sense of variety and is full of energy: \u201d Alright, find the assassin and protect the town!\u201dShen Xingsui was next to him, so he was infected by this energy and gradually integrated into the plot. \u201cFind the assassin!\u201dNing Ze stretched out his hand and said, \u201cCome on.\u201dThe guests formed a group, everyone stretched out one hand, while the other was folded behind their body. They shouted the slogan in unison, \u201cFind the killer, protect the prince, and save the town!\u201dSeeing that today\u2019s the final day, the audience was starting to feeling the atmosphere of the \u201cfinal\u201d:[My dinner reality show is coming to an end.][Especially the idols in the boy group, from the survival show to the present, I really watched them grow up\u2026][It\u2019s coming to an end all of a sudden, so sad.][But fortunately, they are all celebs. We can often see them in the future!] \u00a0 Woohoo, yes,The guests discussed about all they know. While no one (besides Fu Jinxiao) had guessed their identity, it was still a danger to them. In the end, they agreed on being separated so it\u2019s harder for the assassin to poison them all.Shen Xingsui wandered around the small town by himself, and when he passed by a restaurant in the town, the waiter at the door greeted him, \u201cHi Suisui.\u201dShen Xingsui smiled, \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026 I\u2019m looking for something.\u201dThe waiter casually said, \u201cIf you are looking for something, you can worship our Peach Blossom Immortal, so will be lucky.\u201dShen Xingsui\u2019s eyes lit up, and asked, \u201cWhere should I be praying?\u201dThe waiter pointed at the restaurant, \u201cWe have the shrine in our restaurant, do you want to pay respect?\u201dOf course Shen Xingsui agreed. \u201cYes, yes!\u201dThe waiter\u2019s words also reminded him, since the director said the Peach Blossom Immortal hid the treasure, he might have found a clue if he go worship the said Immortal. He entered the restaurant and went to the second floor, and he saw a statue of the Peach Blossom Immortal.Shen Xingsui bowed sincerely in front of the statue, and after he got up to burn incense, he glanced at the desk next to him and found that there seemed to be something wrong, he stretched out his hand enough, and actually touched a token!\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d Shen Xingsui smiled, \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0 so lucky.\u201dThis token was engraved with the big star of the program group, and it could be opened. After taking it apart, Shen Xingsui found a corner of the treasure inside. It was a fragment of something alongside a hint card. However, there\u2019s no text written on the hint card, just peach peach blossom patterns.Shen Xingsui was puzzled, \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201dHe didn\u2019t quite understand.The waiter at the back said, \u201cCould it mean the peach blossom forest? There is a peach blossom forest in our back mountain, although it\u2019s not the season of it to bloom.\u201dShen Xingsui responded, \u201cIt is possible, then I will go and see.\u201dHe picked up the sign and was about to walk towards the peach blossom forest. Just as he was walking, Anran entered the restaurant, and he asked, \u201cHello, has anyone been here just now?\u201dThe waiter said a little vigilantly, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dAnran hurriedly said: \u201cI have something to do with that person, please tell me quickly.\u201d\u201cHe went there.\u201d The waiter just pointed to a random direction, \u201cAs of where is he going\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201dAnran nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201dFacing the camera, Anran smiled, he put away the card he got from another place, and then said to the camera, \u201cIt\u2019s basically confirmed that Suisui is the prince, so we are going to find him now.\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast room were very confused:[Ranran is the assassin, then?][Ahhh, although I logically knew this is just a game setting of the show, I still feel sorry for Suisui.][Wuwu, can you stop doing it?][Come one, this is just a game, Ranran isn\u2019t a killer in the real life. Now after rememberingOn the other side\u2013Shen Xingsui came to the peach blossom forest and found that it was still beautiful despite none of the flower was in full bloom. There was also a tower, and there were staff at the door. At first glance, this tower must be a hidden mission location.\u201cHello.\u201d Shen Xingsui walked over quickly and said politely, \u201cCan I go up this tower?\u201dThe staff nodded and said, \u201cYou can.\u201dShen Xingsui smiled and said, \u201cOkay, thank you.\u201dHe quickly ran to the top of the tower, bypassed the layers of stairs, and found that there were several rooms at the highest floor. There might be something in them. He opened the door and searched. There was nothing in the room on the left. Then, he found out something in the middle room \u2013 a cabinet with a diary hidden inside the drawer!Shen Xingsui opened the diary and saw the story about the manor written in immature handwriting. He said to the cameraman, \u201cThis seems to be the assassin\u2019s diary.\u201dAfter turning a few pages, Shen Xingsui noticed a piece of paper tucked inside the pages, and it said:[My younger brother and I depend on each other for life, but didi is too weak. I am worried that he will not be able to survive.]Younger brother?Then the killer wasn\u2019t the only child.Shen Xingsui\u2019s hand holding the diary was a little trembling, and he said to the cameraman,\u00a0 \u201cSo Fu-ge\u2018s innocence can be cleared up, and this assassin may really have a helper.\u201dJust as Shen Xingsui was about to turn around and leave the room, but there was some movement outside. As soon as he turned around, he met Anran\u2019s eyes. Anran, who was standing at the door, found the note in Shen Xingsui\u2019s hand, and took a deep breath, \u201cI was discovered by you.\u201dShen Xingsui closed the notes and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the assassin, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s meaningless to say that now.\u201d Anran said to Shen Xingsui: \u201cSuisui, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cBang Bang\u201dThe door was closed from the outside.Not only that, Anran seemed to have locked it, he said: \u201cSuisui, this is the room I used as the \u201cyoung master\u201d. If you were in other places, I might really have no choice. I have the key to this room, so please stay inside, and I will let you out after dark!\u201dShen Xingsui rushed over, \u201cAnran!\u201dAnran outside the door seemed to have done something wrong. He ran away directly, leaving behind Shen Xingsui and the cameraman staring wide-eyed.The live broadcast room was also blown up:[Oh my god, Anran is a thief.][Hahahaha, he really can play. Isn\u2019t he usually all-angelic like?][What about Suisui?][You\u2019re locking him up for the day? Are you kidding me! How about his food and drink? Plus, this room is too stuffy, it\u2019s too hot inside!]Shen Xingsui in the house was in a bad mood, but the more urgent the situation was, the calmer he became. After taking a deep breath, he didn\u2019t choose to slap on the door meaninglessly, but opened the window immediately, and then began to look for something in the house that he could use.The cameraman was worried. \u201cIt\u2019s useless for you to jump out of the window, it\u2019s very high here.\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t want to jump out of the window.\u201d Shen Xingsui said helplessly, \u201cHelp me find out if there is any brighter color in this room. We will hang then on the window. This is a tower, and there might be other people who come here. As long as they see our signal, we will be saved.\u201dThe photographer\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cSmart.\u201dAs a result, the two of them searched for a long time but found nothing.Shen Xingsui was a little tired. He took a deep breath and looked at the cameraman\u2019s yellow vest. He stared at him with a thoughtful expression.The cameraman took a step back: \u201cYou, what are you doing?\u201dShen Xingsui smiled and said, \u201cCameraman-ge, please help\u2026\u201dThe cameraman wanted to cry but had no tears.The audience in the live broadcast room were very depressed at first, but they laughed again when they saw this:[Hahahaha, don\u2019t come here, don\u2019t come here! Suisui, the look in your eyes are so funny.][Suisui is very optimistic, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s very calm even during this kind of crisis.][Ahh I agree on that.][Looking at it now, he must be a the kind of person who won\u2019t sit down and wait for his death.]Meanwhile,Anran came out of the tower, all he could think about was how to reconcile with his inner feelings of sheer excitement \u2013 he managed to trap Shen Xingsui! Now, all he needed to do was to pick the guests off one by one.However, he suddenly met someone head-on, and this person also was the last person Anran wanted to meet right now.They said enemies will meet on a narrow road, but Fu Jinxiao isn\u2019t someone he wanted to be his enemy.Anran lowered his head and walked forward, but a voice slowly came from beside him, \u201cStop.\u201d Fu Jinxiao looked down at him and raised his eyebrows, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to find that treasure fragment. \u201cAnran smiled. \u201cFu-ge, you don\u2019t have to go to the tower, I have already looked for it.\u201dFu Jinxiao: \u201cReally?\u201dAnran nodded.Seeing that he was far away from him, Fu Jinxiao walked over and approached him step by step, and casually asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Shen Xingsui, have you see him?\u201dAnran was taken aback, then smiled awkwardly. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t see him at all.\u201dFu Jinxiao curled his lips, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, and Fu-ge, you\u2019d better stay away from Shen Xingsui. I just got a card, and that card said that the assassin has a younger brother in his early twenties. So, that could only be him, the younger brother of the assassin. Uou must be careful, although I\u2019m not sure yet\u2026\u201d Anran continued to step back and try to run away.There was an arch in this path, and he has to go through the arch to get out. Just when Anran was about to reach the arch, he was blocked by a leg.Fu Jinxiao stepped on the door wall with his slender legs, his speed was shockingly fast, Anran didn\u2019t even know when he was behind him. Fu Jinxiao himself was neither blushing nor panting, and even had a relaxed expression on his face. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, aren\u2019t you the assassin?\u201dAnran was worried, and hesitated, \u201cWhat do you mean by\u2026?\u201cHave anyone said to you that your acting skills are poor?\u201dAnran\u2019s face turned pale. \u201cWhat evidence do you have?\u201dHe was sure that he was flawless, and the hints on the task card were so hidden, how did Fu Jinxiao know?Fu Jinxiao said softly, \u201cYesterday I told you that there were books in the attic of the manor that recorded your information, but we couldn\u2019t find which one. I went to the attic just now and found that those books were all destroyed.\u201dAnran said, \u201cHow can you be sure that I\u2019m the one who did it? After all, you told Shen Xingchen and the others too.\u201dFu Jinxiao smiled as if this was just a casual conversation. \u201cBut the place I told them is not the attic, but the study on the second floor. Well, shall I check if some of the books on the second floor are intact?\u201dAnran\u2019s face turned pale in an instant.He always thought that everything was under his control, but he didn\u2019t expect that he would still be played!Fu Jinxiao raised his eyebrows. \u201cYesterday, I suspected that the hint card you got was different from ours. Our hint card is the identity of the assassins, while yours is the clue about the identity of the prince.\u201dAnran stared Fu Jinxiao wide eyes, a little frightened by this man\u2019s intelligence.The corner of Fu Jinxiao\u2019s mouth twitched into an eerie smile. \u201cThat\u2019s why I asked to see your card, and the fact that you are really afraid of me seeing the card has strengthened my guess.\u201dAnran was speechless as to how to deny it. He simply told the truth, \u201c\u2026I, my task card is indeed different from yours.\u201d\u201cWell, so you guessed the identity of the prince, right?\u201d Fu Jinxiao took a step forward. The man was tall and oppressive. Although he had a kind smile on his face, it made people feel cornered by a dangerous hunter. When he reached the feeling of a dead end, he lowered his head and his voice was much lower, \u201cSo what about the prince?\u201dAnran was really scared for a moment.But he still wanted to struggle, so he bullshited, \u201cActually, you can cooperate with me. I only need to poison two more guards, while you just need to find the fragment. In this way, we will win together, right?\u201d\u201cWho told you it\u2019s the same?\u201d Fu Jinxiao stood in front of him. His handsome face felt frighteningly cold, his eyes were deep. The distance between the two of them was not far, but it was enough to prevent the third person from hearing the conversation.Anran heard Fu Jinxiao\u2019s cold voice, laced with hidden threats.\u201cYou dare to try bully him?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, if Anran really asked himself, his memory of Fu Jinxiao seems to have always stopped at this image of Movie Emperor \u2013 the cool, rich, handsome, and polite actor. Even if their relationship was better for a period of time in his previous life, Anran always felt as if there was a thin veil between him and Fu Jinxiao.Can\u2019t get close to his heart.In his previous life, he had already married off and established a business in the end, but Fu Jinxiao was still single. That person seemed destined to be lonely, and the person who could understand him and be accepted by him had never appeared.In this life, Anran thought he could do it. But now, he suddenly felt that they were separated by thousands of mountains. When he felt that he knew Fu Jinxiao very well, he realized that what he knew was just the tip of the iceberg. The man never took off his public persona. And once he took it off, he was so terrifying.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast room were anxious to death:[What\u2019s going on, what are they talking about??][It\u2019s too far away, I can\u2019t hear them clearly.][But the posture is so ambiguous.][I still kowtow to Fu-ge despite liking Suisui more hehehe.]Fu Jinxiao probably had enough scaring Anran, so he left. He turned on the microphone on his body again, and the cameraman behind asked where he was going now.Fu Jinxiao simply answered, \u201cPeach blossom forest.\u201dThe forest was not blooming in autumn at this moment, and it was easy to see the tall tower and the staff standing downstairs when walking over it. The staff tried to stop Fu Jinxiao after seeing the place, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Fu-ge, but you can\u2019t go up this tower now.\u201dFu Jinxiao stopped and raised his eyebrows at him. \u201cThe reason.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s locked now.\u201d The staff explained, \u201cSo according to the regulations, you can\u2019t go up now.\u201dFu Jinxiao stood at the door, raised his head, glanced up casually, and happened to see the little yellow vest fluttering on the top tower. The bright clothes were fluttering in the wind, a very stark contrast to the serious-looking tower. It created a funny feeling.He lowered his head and faced the staff. It was obvious that he was going to enter the door. The staff was guarding the door, but the staff obviously seemed much more nervous than him.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s handsome eyebrows were slightly curved, and he stood there calmly and naturally, with a kind expression on his face. \u201cReally?\u201dThe staff nodded nervously.\u201cThen has anyone told you\u2026\u201d Fu Jinxiao spoke slowly, but his voice was lowered a lot. The smile in his eyes deepened but hidden dangers, he still had the calm and undisciplined posture, but it was full of hostility. He smirked, revealing the arrogance within him, \u201cI don\u2019t like to be restricted by arbitrary rules.\u201dThe staff was stunned speechless.In recent years, Fu Jinxiao\u2019s behavior has been low-key, always modest and polite. This made everyone forget that in the early years, he was also a willful young master who did not play cards according to common sense.Fu Jinxiao scanned the tightly closed door with a little more interest in his eyes.The staff subconsciously took a few steps back to cover the lock. Who knew that Fu Jinxiao didn\u2019t do anything, but whispered, \u201cExcuse me.\u201dObviously the initiative is in his own hands, but when Fu Jinxiao gave such orders, the staff couldn\u2019t help but obey his order. He moved away slowly, and obediently gave way to let Fu Jinxiao in.Fu Jinxiao directly ignored the door, and jumped in through the window, with a chic and handsome movement, almost without any hesitation. Even the cameraman behind could not respond or keep up.Fu Jinxiao waved at the dumbfounded staff outside, and turned around to leave.The cameraman was carrying a huge camera, and looked at the gatekeepers outside. It took him a long time to say anything, \u201cCan you open the door, I can\u2019t get through this window.\u201dThe Staff: \u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dOf course, the live broadcast audience was laughing at this scene.[The Immortal\u2019s treasure isn\u2019t as good as whatever this is.][Hahahaha, poor staff member!][Oh my God, I\u2019ve watched many shows that Fu Jinxiao starred in and never has he been this serious when playing a game.][Huh, now that you mention it, you\u2019re right.]Shen Xingsui was sitting on the floor. When he heard a movement outside the room, he was taken aback, and quickly asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Fu Jinxiao\u2019s voice came from outside the door. The man stood at the door and asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201dShen Xingsui was overwhelmed with excitement when he learned that Fu Jinxiao was here, and he stood up a little too excitedly, \u201cTeacher Fu! I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m okay. It\u2019s great that you can come, but this door seems to be locked from the outside!\u201dFu Jinxiao said, \u201cI know.\u201dShen Xingsui said hesitantly, \u201cDo you have the key?\u201dFu Jinxiao took a rough look at this door. The wooden old-style door can be opened without any problem if you use force. However, the problem is that Taohuawu Town was an ancient town left over from history, and this tower was also a cultural relic. Regarding the issue of compensation, he still needed to treat cultural relics with a more protective attitude.Fu Jinxiao simply replied, \u201cNo.\u201dShen Xingsui was taken aback: \u201cAh, ah\u2026?\u201dHe really felt that Fu Jinxiao was omnipotent within his subconscious. He didn\u2019t think that a mere lock could stop him.Shen Xingsui was relieved that Fu Jinxiao was here, and just wanted to persuade him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Fu-ge, the scenery here is actually pretty good. Why don\u2019t you go first, when it\u2019s later\u2026\u201dThere was a noisy \u201cclick-clack\u201d sound on the door. Then a minute later, the door was unlocked.The door of the room was slowly pushed open, and the man standing outside had a straight back, a stern face, and a gentle smile. He raised his eyebrows, \u201cWhen is this later?\u201dShen Xingsui: \u201c?\u201dHe was still a little puzzled, so he curiously asked, \u201cTeacher, how did you open the door?\u201d\u201cYou mean this door?\u201d Fu Jinxiao spread his hands and said, \u201cIt happened that a student gave me a small gift in school yesterday. This toy happened to have a copper wire inside, so I just took it apart and picked the lock.\u201dShen Xingsui widened his eyes in disbelief after hearing this.The audience in the live broadcast room was excited:[???You have this skill???][Wait, is this all right?][Suisui and I were both shocked, okay?][This is illegal right.][Fu-ge is still Fu-ge.][Is this the advantage of being skilled?]Shen Xingsui stammered before he stumbled and said: \u201cYou\u2026 too powerful, I, uh\u2026 that\u2019s it.\u201dFu Jinxiao said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s just a low-level trick, I learned it to pass the time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s a good activity to pass the time.Suddenly, Shen Xingsui had too many questions to pick from, he didn\u2019t know where to start.But Shen Xingsui still hastily said, \u201cThank you, I just hung the yellow vest on the window. I thought that if someone passed by and saw it, maybe I would be saved. I didn\u2019t expect to wait for you. Thank you so much.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Fu Jinxiao responded lightly, and hooked his lips up, \u201cI didn\u2019t just happen to pass by.\u201dShen Xingsui was taken aback.Fu Jinxiao\u2019s dark eyes glanced at him, but he didn\u2019t continue talking.However, these suggestive words were enough to make people feel uneasy. After Shen Xingsui heard the words, he stood there stupidly, blinking his eyelashes, as if he was digesting the message.But Fu Jinxiao still continued, \u201cIt\u2019s hot in this room, let\u2019s get out first.\u201dShen Xingsui only came back to his senses, but he also quickly reacted and said, \u201cWait a minute, Teacher Fu, I discovered something in this room!\u201dThe actor asked his eyebrows in interest. \u201cOh?\u201dShen Xingsui was very excited about this. He came over and took Fu Jinxiao\u2019s wrist, and pulled him to the window outside. He pointed to the scenery outside and said, \u201cLook, from here you can see the appearance of the whole town. What shape do you think this town looks like?\u201dIf they didn\u2019t stand so high, it would be difficult to find out that the town is actually in the shape of a peach blossom. There\u2019s a tall building as the centerpiece of the town, then from there, the shape of the \u201cpetals\u201d were distributed out. It was beautiful.Fu Jinxiao commented, \u201cNo wonder all the theme is peach blossom.\u201dShen Xingsui nodded frantically, but this was not all he had discovered, so he took out the card and map he had found, and said very positively, \u201cI\u2019m very interested in this, so I looked at the map. I found something. Do you remember where everyone worked when we first arrived in the town?\u201dFu Jinxiao has a very good memory, of course he remembered. He even recited them all.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Shen Xingsui made the decision. He compared the locations of the part-time job with the town\u2019s map. He pointed at the locations. \u201cI found restaurants and bookstores, for example, are located directly at the petal\u2019s center-point. Plus, when I visited the restaurant, I got this fragment and a peach blossom-patterned card. I can guess with confidence that all the fragments must have been hidden in our workplace!\u201dFu Jinxiao twitched his lips after listening to his analysis, and nodded approvingly. \u201cNot bad, very detailed.\u201dShen Xingsui was so bored in the room that he was sweating all over, but under such circumstances, he did not give up on himself. Instead, he thought of a way out and a way to survive in this difficult environment; and at the same time found a solution to the original mission. The method, relying on these few things alone, was already very good.This flash of brilliance was recognized by the audience, too.[Suisui is so smart! I didn\u2019t think of that.][The point is that he was the first to discover it!][Fuck, so exciting. Go get that assassin Anran!]Shen Xingsui\u2019s eyes were shining brightly, he was obviously very happy after getting Fu Jinxiao\u2019s affirmation. With a smile on his face, he said, \u201cThen can we go get the fragments, and then\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao fully understood what he meant, and opened his lips to give a firm answer. \u201cRevenge.\u201dShen Xingsui\u2019s smile was brightened even further. He nodded fiercely when he heard Fu Jinxiao\u2019s words. \u201cThen, let\u2019s go!\u201dOnce they got the clue, the speed of finding things was much faster.After coming out of the tower, they found the fragment hidden in the bookstore according to the map. They already had three fragments gathered in their hands. On the way, Shen Xingsui was still discussing the plan with Fu Jinxiao, and happened to meet two other people.Xu Qinke and Feng Fan have always kept a low profile, but they were still very excited when they saw Shen Xingsui.Xu Qinke panted and said, \u201cYou guys, you have to be careful, we probably guessed who the killer is.\u201dThey said a name together in unison: \u201cAnran!\u201dXu Qinke was stunned. \u201cAh, so you have already guessed it.\u201d\u201cWell, I read the \u2018young master\u2019s\u2019 diary.\u201d Shen Xingsui nodded, a little dumbfounded. \u201cSpeaking of it, the process was actually rather tortuous and bizarre, but I guessed it in the end.\u201dFeng Fan continued his partner\u2019s thoughts, \u201cBut what we deduced is that besides Anran, there should be another assassin.\u201dShen Xingsui immediately said: \u201cHe has a younger brother, this person is his accomplice. Hm\u2026 maybe, he should be the youngest person among the guests?\u201dThis made everyone think. Simply put, Shen Xingsui and Anran should be the youngest people among them.But then, Fu Jinxiao sighed softly, and promptly saved the group of idiots who had strayed from their thoughts. \u201cWhy can\u2019t the younger brother be Anran?\u201d\u201c!!\u201dAh yeah, that could work too.Shen Xingsui, including the other two, looked at Fu Jinxiao with admiration, with an expression of both shock and awe written clearly on their faces.Fu Jinxiao: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast room were all happy when they saw this scene:[Hahaha, there\u2019s a mile difference between the king and the idiots.][If there is no Teacher Fu for this group of idiots, I am afraid that the whole guards will be wiped out.][The director team has worked hard.][Then, shouldn\u2019t Fu Jinxiao be the MVP?]After having the right idea, everyone finally could discuss with the right mindset. They summed up all the clues. It couldn\u2019t be Shen Xingchen, who the staff didn\u2019t know had a younger brother until recently. It couldn\u2019t be Fu Jinxiao, the only child. It could only be Ning Ze, the one who escaped from their thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hiding very deeply.Xu Qinke said, \u201cThen Shen Xingchen is in danger. He just walked with Ning Ze.\u201dJust as he said that, a voice sounded through the broadcast channel. \u201cIn this round, Tuya, Li Xu\u2019an, and Instructor Li are eliminated.\u201d\u201c??\u201dPuzzled expressions appeared on everyone\u2019s face. Not only was Shen Xingchen the closest to the killer, he was half poisoned yesterday. But he was fine?Just as he was thinking, a group of people came over not far away \u2013 they happened to be Shen Xingchen and someone else. They seemed to be arguing about something while walking, and it couldn\u2019t be heard clearly until they got closer.Shen Xingchen said rather disgustingly, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to save me.\u201dLi Xu\u2019an sighed and said, \u201cYou have artifact fragments on you, it would be better if you were alive.\u201dHe glared at Ning Ze, and sniped at him again, \u201cYou traitor.\u201dNing Ze shrugged helplessly.As they finally reconciled, Shen Xingchen saw someone familiar far from him. The young master\u2019s eyes lit up, then ran after them in a hurry. He shouted in an angry manner, \u201cNing Ze and Anran are both the assassins, we heavily paid for our mistake!\u201dShen Xingsui looked at his older brother. He looked like a puffy, angry hedgehog.He looked very cute when he\u2019s all huffy like this. This was just Shen Xingchen\u2019s character \u2013 his mind was very simple. Shen Xingsui bet that his brother would have forgiven Ning Ze in a matter of hours.Shen Xingchen said righteously, \u201cI have a fragment here. Hurry up and find the rest. Let\u2019s get our revenge, and get rid of these insidious and cunning people for the town!\u201dShen Xingsui and Fu Jinxiao looked at each other.Fu Jinxiao nodded lightly, took out all the pieces and said, \u201cTogether, we have four pieces.\u201dShen Xingchen was shocked. It was only the afternoon and he (plus his groups) have only found one fragment. He originally thought they would have a grueling time ahead\u2026 but he was wrong. The total was six fragments, which means they only need to find two more fragments!Seeing this, Xu Qinke said in a small voice, \u201cActually, we both have one fragment. Our combined total is five fragments now.\u201d\u201c!!?\u201dNo one expected that things would go this smoothly.However, it was Fu Jinxiao who knew the most important point. He directly asked, \u201cHow did the three of them get eliminated? How did you get poisoned yesterday? Do you have any ideas?\u201dShen Xingchen was directly stopped by the question.He recalled it carefully, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. In fact, the three of us plus the two instructors met together at the beginning, and we just went around the town to search for the fragments. We\u2026 didn\u2019t do anything special. We were chatting as normal, then Li Xu\u2019an interjected a few times. Suddenly, the three of them was eliminated.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSeveral people fell into silence.They didn\u2019t know the assassin\u2019s way of eliminating people, and they undoubtedly put themselves in a dangerous situation.Shen Xingsui asked, \u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201dShen Xingchen replied honestly, despite feeling very irritated now, \u201cJust chatting about some homework. Ning Ze asked me something about me, and finally asked me if he could go somewhere else. Before I answered, Li Xu\u2019an and Instructor Tuya said he could go, and then we were halfway here, and they were eliminated.\u201dShen Xingsui\u2019s face also became serious: \u201cThere must be a problem, there must be something\u2026\u201dFu Jinxiao\u2019s dark eyes dimmed slightly, and when he was thinking, the aura around him was very serious. He glanced at Shen Xingchen: \u201cYesterday you met Anran, what did you talk about?\u201dShen Xingchen recalled,\u201dWe didn\u2019t talk about anything special? I think\u2026 he came over to help chop firewood, and then he disappeared.\u201d\u201cSpecifically.\u201d Fu Jinxiao said in a deep voice, \u201cWhat did he say?\u201dShen Xingchen murmured, \u201cHe asked me if I could give him the axe, and he wanted to try it too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone was silent for a moment.Then everyone suddenly realized at the same time, and said in unison, \u201cThe way to poison is to ask for permission!\u201d\u201cThat or coming in contact with something the assassin touched\u2026 but either way, I didn\u2019t think it was something like this.\u201d Shen Xingchen grumbled.Everyone smiled bitterly, and said with a sigh, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad.\u201dBut since they knew the way, there was nothing to be afraid of. They also had a map in their hands, and they followed the route directly to the last antique shop booth, and there it was. They met the stall owner and found the fragments from their hands. All six fragments were collected before sunset.The director rejoiced, \u201cCongratulations to the prince\u2019s group for winning!\u201dThe others all came over to congratulate each other. Shen Xingchen hit Ning Ze but forgave his good friend very quickly. His temper came and went quickly. Their relationship was good, so there\u2019s no way this kind of game would devolve into a petty grudge.As for the audience comments, they were happy and moved by the finale.[It\u2019s too difficult to win.][If it weren\u2019t for Suisui\u2019s analysis, they would have to search for the fragments like headless chickens.][No need to say anything more. Fu-ge MVP!][I think Suisui has a fair chance as the MVP too, he\u2019s the one who found all the locations.][The assassin\u2019s power is a lot, but it\u2019s a 2v8 for them.][Yup, Suisui was also locked in the tower, I think it\u2019s admirable he was able to find the key while being trapped there.]The first episode of the first season of \u201cBright Stars\u201d came to a perfect end with the end of this game.The director smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for everyone to work hard. I believe that after these five days of getting along, everyone has also established a deep relationship. We have prepared a surprise for you all. Now, please enter the restaurant\u2019s second floor. We have already posted your names, you just need to enter the room according to the name.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlthough it was a \u201csurprise\u201d, everyone had an ominous premonition in their hearts.During the time spent with the program group, their trust to the crew has taken a drastic dive. Simply put, they always diligently dug a pit for them.Shen Xingchen was the first to accept, but before he left, he put down a wave of threats, \u201cDirector, you\u2019d better not lie to us. Otherwise, when the show is over, be careful because I\u2019ll climb your window.\u201dThe director didn\u2019t know how to answer that. \u00a0 \u00a0 .Everyone went up to the second floor one after another. Shen Xingsui found that his room was the first one. He hesitated, walked in, and found that there was actually a camera and a staff member sitting there, waiting for him. Seeing him coming, the staff smiled, \u201cPlease sit down.\u201dShen Xingsui sat down.The staff member pointed to the paper on the table and said: \u201cPlease write down the name of your closest and favorite person in this program group on this paper. Write down what you want to say to them. This person will get a gift in your name.\u201dShen Xingsui was taken aback, \u201cOnly one person?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d The staff explained the rules to him in detail, \u201cAh, better make sure that your favorite person would also write down your name in return. Because, we\u2019ll announce it publicly! If your letter isn\u2019t requited, then it would be an embarrassing situation. You also won\u2019t get the gift. So, please think more carefully.\u201dThis cheating program group was too evil. Come on!Shen Xingsui was confused after listening to it. It was quite difficult to write this letter. When it comes to the person closest to him, of course it is his brother Shen Xingchen, but when it comes to the person he likes the most\u2026 of course, it is his idol.But the question is, will Fu Jinxiao choose Shen Xingsui in return?He has been friends with Tuya and Teacher Li for many years. Logically speaking, he should choose them, not him, a junior who he has only known for less than half a year.So Shen Xingsui shouldn\u2019t have any wishful thinking, otherwise when his result was unrequited\u2026 then it would be tremendously embarrassing. Plus, he didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for Fu Jinxiao.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe staff urged, \u201cPlease write quicker. We have a time limit here.\u201dHe had no time to hesitate. After a deep sigh, he filled Shen Xingchen\u2019s name.The staff took a look at the list and said to Shen Xingsui, \u201cAre you sure?\u201dShen Xingsui nodded.\u201cOkay, please go out and wait.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter coming out, other people came out slowly. Everyone looked at each other, with the same question plaguing inside their mind.Shen Xingchen came out from inside his room and asked, \u201cWho did you write?\u201dShen Xingsui could only smile, \u201cWell, let\u2019s wait for the announcement.\u201dNot long after, the director came out rolling a cart full of gift bags. With a smile on his face, he said, \u201cCongratulations to everyone who has completed the challenge, so now let\u2019s announce the list of people who have received letters and gifts.\u201dEveryone held their breath.A staff member read the cue card in his hand. \u201cFirst of all, Xu Qinke, congratulations on receiving a letter and a gift.\u201dXu Qinke smiled and bowed to everyone, \u201cThank you.\u201dThe staff member said with a smile, \u201cThe person you selected has also sent you a letter, congratulations!\u201dXu Qinke turned around and hugged Feng Fan, both of them smiled.The staff began to read the list of the remaining personnel:\u201cShen Xingchen, congratulations on receiving two letters and two gifts.\u201d\u201cShen Xingsui, congratulations on receiving two letters and two gifts.\u201dThe staff looked at the two and smiled and said, \u201cCongratulations, the person you selected also sent you a letter in return.\u201dShen Xingsui and Shen Xingchen shared a high-five.Then, Shen Xingsui subconsciously looked in Fu Jinxiao\u2019s direction, feeling a little apprehensive and speculative. He didn\u2019t know who Fu Jinxiao had given his letter to, but he was curious.Sitting on the sofa not far away, the lazy Actor Fu peeked at him with a meaningful look.Shen Xingsui inexplicably felt that there was a sharp edge behind his back, which made him feel he was in danger.Fortunately, the staff continued to read: \u201cMr. Fu, congratulations on receiving the two letters and two gifts. But unfortunately, the person you selected did not choose you. \u201c\u201c\u2026\u201dThen, everyone fell quiet.Almost in an instant, everyone\u2019s gaze focused on Fu Jinxiao. Things suddenly become more interesting.Tuya was the first to cover her smile, \u201cE-even this Actor Fu\u2026 fell into an unrequited love? Pfft\u2013\u201dInstructor Li was also ruthless enough to laugh at his friend, \u201cAlthough I chose you, and was unrequited, I feel so fine right now. Bahahaha!! So sad, I guess you\u2019re in a more difficult position compared to me.\u201dSitting on the sofa, Fu Jinxiao calmly accepted the onlookers. He gave both of his \u201cfriends\u201d a scary smile, but his tone was still gentle, \u201cIs it so funny?\u201dBoth of them nodded in unison, and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s so funny!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis is a legendary story!That\u2019s Fu Jinxiao \u2013 the man who is known as the national male god and has won the most popular award for five consecutive years! And there\u2019s still a day when his letter was \u201cunrequited\u201d!! Amazing!!The audience in the live broadcast room was even more in an uproar.[Hahaha, sisters. Fu-ge is so sad, but I can\u2019t stop laughing!][I\u2019m laughing to death. Who is this heroic person who didn\u2019t select him? You\u2019re very brave!!][Refusing my sweet Fu-ge? Damn, legendary.][I\u2019m very curious now, who is it?][Hahaha, director, hurry up and announce the name, or I won\u2019t be able to feel at ease for all day!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
